Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Words with frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, O, I, and C are good choices. 

A strong starting word should also avoid repetition of letters to test as many unique letters as possible. Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it contains very common letters and provides good coverage for vowels and consonants.

All five letters in CRANE are not in the secret word at all.  
So we must pick a word that uses none of C, R, A, N, E.

We still want common letters to maximize information.  
Good remaining common consonants: S, T, L, D, B, M, H, G, K  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U

Let’s choose a word that mixes several of these.  
One candidate is “SLOTH” (S, L, O, T, H) – it avoids all forbidden letters and uses common ones.

Another candidate is “BUILD” (B, U, I, L, D) – also safe and common letters.

I’ll go with “SLOTH” first.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters that are **not in the word**: C, R, A, N, E, L, O, T  
- Letters that **are in the word but in the wrong place**: S and H (both currently at position 1 and 5 respectively)

So every letter we pick must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding C,R,A,N,E,L,O,T.  
That leaves:  
B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the known letters S and H whose positions must change.

We still want common letters to maximize information.  
Among the remaining consonants, common ones are: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, W, Y  
Among the remaining vowels, common ones are: I, U

We need to place S and H somewhere else (not at positions 1 or 5 for S, not at position 5 for H).  
Let’s try to build a word that uses S and H in new positions plus some fresh common consonants and vowels.

One candidate:  
- H must not be at position 5, so let’s try it in position 2 or 3 or 4.  
- S must not be at position 1, so let’s try it in position 2, 3, 4 or 5.

Let’s try:  
- Position 1: B (common consonant, not yet tested)  
- Position 2: S (new position for S)  
- Position 3: I (vowel, new)  
- Position 4: M (consonant, new)  
- Position 5: H (new position for H)

Word: B S I M H → “BSIMH” is not valid.  
Need a valid 5-letter English word.

Another candidate:  
- Position 1: B  
- Position 2: H (new position)  
- Position 3: I  
- Position 4: S (new position)  
- Position 5: K (consonant, new)

Word: B H I S K → “BHISK” is not valid.

Third candidate:  
- Position 1: W  
- Position 2: S (new)  
- Position 3: I  
- Position 4: M  
- Position 5: H (new)

Word: W S I M H → “WSIMH” invalid.

Fourth candidate:  
- Position 1: P  
- Position 2: S (new)  
- Position 3: I  
- Position 4: M  
- Position 5: H (new)

Word: P S I M H → “PSIMH” invalid.

Fifth candidate:  
- Position 1: D  
- Position 2: S (new)  
- Position 3: I  
- Position 4: M  
- Position 5: H (new)

Word: D S I M H → “DSIMH” invalid.

We need a valid dictionary word.  
Let’s look for real words using the constraints:

- Must contain S and H  
- Must not contain C,R,A,N,E,L,O,T  
- S cannot be at position 1  
- H cannot be at position 5

Valid candidates:  
- BISHK – invalid  
- WISPY – uses W, I, S, P, Y – all allowed, and S at 3, H at 2  
  Word: W I S P Y → “WISPY” is valid.

Check letters: W, I, S, P, Y – none are in the forbidden set.  
Positions: S is at 3 (not 1), H is at 2 (not 5).  
This seems good.

Another candidate:  
- “SPIKY” – S at 1 is forbidden.  
- “SHIMD” – invalid.  
- “WHISK” – H at 2, S at 3, I at 4, K at 5 – all allowed.  
  Word: W H I S K – “WHISK” is valid.

Between WISPY and WHISK, both are valid.  
Let’s pick WHISK as it uses more consonants and the vowel I.

But wait: we already know I is allowed (it was not marked x in any feedback).  
Both words are valid.  
Let’s go with WHISK.

Actually, let me double-check:  
- C,R,A,N,E,L,O,T are excluded.  
- W, H, I, S, K – none of these are in the excluded set.  
- Positions:  
  – W (1) – allowed  
  – H (2) – allowed (not position 5)  
  – I (3) – allowed  
  – S (4) – allowed (not position 1)

So WHISK meets all constraints.

- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)

Another candidate is “BUILD” (B, U, I, L, D) – also safe and common letters.

I’ll go with “SLOTH” first.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SLOTH -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) O(x) T(x) H(-)
<|im_end|>

From the feedback so far:

- Letters that are **not in the word**: C, R, A, N, E, L, O, T  
- Letters that **are in the word but in the wrong place**: S and H (both currently at position 1 and 5 respectively)

So every letter we pick must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding C,R,A,N,E,L,O,T.  
That leaves:  
B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the known letters S and H whose positions must change.

We still want common letters to maximize information.  
Among the remaining consonants, common ones are: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, W, Y  
Among the remaining vowels, common ones are: I, U

We need to place S and H somewhere else (not at positions 1 or 5 for S, not at position 5 for H).  
Let’s try to build a word that uses S and H in new positions plus some fresh common consonants and vowels.

One candidate:  
- H must not be at position 5, so let’s try it in position 2 or 3 or 4.  
- S must not be at position 1, so let’s try it in position 2, 3, 4 or 5.

Let’s try:  
- Position 1: B (common consonant, not yet tested)  
- Position 2: S (new position for S)  
- Position 3: I (vowel, new)  
- Position 4: M (consonant, new)  
- Position 5: H (new position for H)

Word: B S I M H → “BSIMH” is not valid.  
Need a valid 5-letter English word.

Another candidate:  
- Position 1: B  
- Position 2: H (new position)  
- Position 3: I  
- Position 4: S (new position)  
- Position 5: K (consonant, new)

Word: B H I S K → “BHISK” is not valid.

Third candidate:  
- Position 1: W  
- Position 2: S (new)  
- Position 3: I  
- Position 4: M  
- Position 5: H (new)

Word: W S I M H → “WSIMH” invalid.

Fourth candidate:  
- Position 1: P  
- Position 2: S (new)  
- Position 3: I  
- Position 4: M  
- Position 5: H (new)

Word: P S I M H → “PSIMH” invalid.

Fifth candidate:  
- Position 1: D  
- Position 2: S (new)  
- Position 3: I  
- Position 4: M  
- Position 5: H (new)

Word: D S I M H → “DSIMH” invalid.

We need a valid dictionary word.  
Let’s look for real words using the constraints:

- Must contain S and H  
- Must not contain C,R,A,N,E,L,O,T  
- S cannot be at position 1  
- H cannot be at position 5

Valid candidates:  
- BISHK – invalid  
- WISPY – uses W, I, S, P, Y – all allowed, and S at 3, H at 2  
  Word: W I S P Y → “WISPY” is valid.

Check letters: W, I, S, P, Y – none are in the forbidden set.  
Positions: S is at 3 (not 1), H is at 2 (not 5).  
This seems good.

Another candidate:  
- “SPIKY” – S at 1 is forbidden.  
- “SHIMD” – invalid.  
- “WHISK” – H at 2, S at 3, I at 4, K at 5 – all allowed.  
  Word: W H I S K – “WHISK” is valid.

Between WISPY and WHISK, both are valid.  
Let’s pick WHISK as it uses more consonants and the vowel I.

But wait: we already know I is allowed (it was not marked x in any feedback).  
Both words are valid.  
Let’s go with WHISK.

Actually, let me double-check:  
- C,R,A,N,E,L,O,T are excluded.  
- W, H, I, S, K – none of these are in the excluded set.  
- Positions:  
  – W (1) – allowed  
  – H (2) – allowed (not position 5)  
  – I (3) – allowed  
  – S (4) – allowed (not position 1)  
  – K (5) – allowed  

So WHISK meets all constraints.

I’ll submit WHISK.

Let’s synthesize all the feedback so far.

Letters known NOT in the word (x feedback):  
C, R, A, N, E, L, O, T, W, I, K

Letters known to BE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
S and H (both previously marked “-”)

So every remaining candidate must:
1. Contain both S and H.
2. Use only letters that have not been ruled out.
3. Place S and H in different positions than they occupied in earlier guesses.

Previous positions that are now forbidden:
- S cannot be at position 1 (Guess 2) or 4 (Guess 3)  
- H cannot be at position 5 (Guess 2) or 2 (Guess 3)

Therefore:
- S must be at 2, 3, or 5.
- H must be at 1, 3, or 4.

Remaining available letters (not yet excluded):  
B, D, F, G, J, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
- Contains S and H in the allowed positions above.
- Uses only the allowed letters for the remaining three slots.

Let’s list every valid combination:

1. H _ _ S _   (H at 1, S at 4) – but 4 is forbidden for S, so discard.
2. H _ S _ _   (H at 1, S at 3) – possible.
3. _ H _ S _   (H at 2, S at 4) – but 4 is forbidden for S, so discard.
4. _ H S _ _   (H at 2, S at 3) – possible.
5. _ _ H S _   (H at 3, S at 4) – 4 forbidden for S, discard.
6. _ _ H _ S   (H at 3, S at 5) – possible.

So the only viable patterns are:
- H _ S _ _  (H1, S3)
- _ H S _ _  (H2, S3)
- _ _ H _ S  (H3, S5)

We must fill the blanks with allowed letters and form a valid word.

Check each pattern:

Pattern 1: H _ S _ _
   Possible letters for blanks: B, D, F, G, J, M, P, Q, U, V, Y, Z
   Need a valid word H _ S _ _.
   Example: HUMPS – but P is allowed, M is allowed, U is allowed.
   HUMPS is valid.

Pattern 2: _ H S _ _
   Need a valid word _ H S _ _.
   Example: B H S _ _ – no common word.
   D H S _ _ – no.
   G H S _ _ – no.
   M H S _ _ – no.
   P H S _ _ – no.
   No obvious common words fit.

Pattern 3: _ _ H _ S
   Need a valid word _ _ H _ S.
   Example: B U H A S – invalid.
   D U H A S – invalid.
   M U H A S – invalid.
   F U H A S – invalid.
   G U H A S – invalid.
   Not finding common words here easily.

Thus the only promising candidate is HUMPS.

Verify HUMPS:
- Letters: H, U, M, P, S – none are in the excluded set.
- Contains S and H.
- Positions:
   H at 1 – allowed (was only forbidden at 2 and 5)  
   U at 2 – allowed  
   M at 3 – allowed  
   P at 4 – allowed  
   S at 5 – allowed (was only forbidden at 1 and 4)  

So HUMPS meets every constraint and is a valid 5-letter English word.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Words with frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, O, I, and C are good choices. 

A strong starting word should also avoid repetition of letters to test as many unique letters as possible. Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it contains very common letters and provides good coverage for vowels and consonants.

All five letters in CRANE are not in the secret word at all.  
So we must pick a word that uses none of C, R, A, N, E.

We still want common letters to maximize information.  
Good remaining common consonants: S, T, L, D, B, M, H, G, K  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U

Let’s choose a word that mixes several of these.  
One candidate is “SLOTH” (S, L, O, T, H) – it avoids all forbidden letters and uses common ones.

Another candidate is “BUILD” (B, U, I, L, D) – also safe and common letters.

I’ll go with “SLOTH” first.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters that are **not in the word**: C, R, A, N, E, L, O, T  
- Letters that **are in the word but in the wrong place**: S and H (both currently at position 1 and 5 respectively)

So every letter we pick must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding C,R,A,N,E,L,O,T.  
That leaves:  
B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the known letters S and H whose positions must change.

We still want common letters to maximize information.  
Among the remaining consonants, common ones are: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, W, Y  
Among the remaining vowels, common ones are: I, U

We need to place S and H somewhere else (not at positions 1 or 5 for S, not at position 5 for H).  
Let’s try to build a word that uses S and H in new positions plus some fresh common consonants and vowels.

One candidate:  
- H must not be at position 5, so let’s try it in position 2 or 3 or 4.  
- S must not be at position 1, so let’s try it in position 2, 3, 4 or 5.

Let’s try:  
- Position 1: B (common consonant, not yet tested)  
- Position 2: S (new position for S)  
- Position 3: I (vowel, new)  
- Position 4: M (consonant, new)  
- Position 5: H (new position for H)

Word: B S I M H → “BSIMH” is not valid.  
Need a valid 5-letter English word.

Another candidate:  
- Position 1: B  
- Position 2: H (new position)  
- Position 3: I  
- Position 4: S (new position)  
- Position 5: K (consonant, new)

Word: B H I S K → “BHISK” is not valid.

Third candidate:  
- Position 1: W  
- Position 2: S (new)  
- Position 3: I  
- Position 4: M  
- Position 5: H (new)

Word: W S I M H → “WSIMH” invalid.

Fourth candidate:  
- Position 1: P  
- Position 2: S (new)  
- Position 3: I  
- Position 4: M  
- Position 5: H (new)

Word: P S I M H → “PSIMH” invalid.

Fifth candidate:  
- Position 1: D  
- Position 2: S (new)  
- Position 3: I  
- Position 4: M  
- Position 5: H (new)

Word: D S I M H → “DSIMH” invalid.

We need a valid dictionary word.  
Let’s look for real words using the constraints:

- Must contain S and H  
- Must not contain C,R,A,N,E,L,O,T  
- S cannot be at position 1  
- H cannot be at position 5

Valid candidates:  
- BISHK – invalid  
- WISPY – uses W, I, S, P, Y – all allowed, and S at 3, H at 2  
  Word: W I S P Y → “WISPY” is valid.

Check letters: W, I, S, P, Y – none are in the forbidden set.  
Positions: S is at 3 (not 1), H is at 2 (not 5).  
This seems good.

Another candidate:  
- “SPIKY” – S at 1 is forbidden.  
- “SHIMD” – invalid.  
- “WHISK” – H at 2, S at 3, I at 4, K at 5 – all allowed.  
  Word: W H I S K – “WHISK” is valid.

Between WISPY and WHISK, both are valid.  
Let’s pick WHISK as it uses more consonants and the vowel I.

But wait: we already know I is allowed (it was not marked x in any feedback).  
Both words are valid.  
Let’s go with WHISK.

Actually, let me double-check:  
- C,R,A,N,E,L,O,T are excluded.  
- W, H, I, S, K – none of these are in the excluded set.  
- Positions:  
  – W (1) – allowed  
  – H (2) – allowed (not position 5)  
  – I (3) – allowed  
  – S (4) – allowed (not position 1)  
  – K (5) – allowed  

So WHISK meets all constraints.

I’ll submit WHISK.

Let’s synthesize all the feedback so far.

Letters known NOT in the word (x feedback):  
C, R, A, N, E, L, O, T, W, I, K

Letters known to BE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
S and H (both previously marked “-”)

So every remaining candidate must:
1. Contain both S and H.
2. Use only letters that have not been ruled out.
3. Place S and H in different positions than they occupied in earlier guesses.

Previous positions that are now forbidden:
- S cannot be at position 1 (Guess 2) or 4 (Guess 3)  
- H cannot be at position 5 (Guess 2) or 2 (Guess 3)

Therefore:
- S must be at 2, 3, or 5.
- H must be at 1, 3, or 4.

Remaining available letters (not yet excluded):  
B, D, F, G, J, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
- Contains S and H in the allowed positions above.
- Uses only the allowed letters for the remaining three slots.

Let’s list every valid combination:

1. H _ _ S _   (H at 1, S at 4) – but 4 is forbidden for S, so discard.
2. H _ S _ _   (H at 1, S at 3) – possible.
3. _ H _ S _   (H at 2, S at 4) – but 4 is forbidden for S, so discard.
4. _ H S _ _   (H at 2, S at 3) – possible.
5. _ _ H S _   (H at 3, S at 4) – 4 forbidden for S, discard.
6. _ _ H _ S   (H at 3, S at 5) – possible.

So the only viable patterns are:
- H _ S _ _  (H1, S3)
- _ H S _ _  (H2, S3)
- _ _ H _ S  (H3, S5)

We must fill the blanks with allowed letters and form a valid word.

Check each pattern:

Pattern 1: H _ S _ _
   Possible letters for blanks: B, D, F, G, J, M, P, Q, U, V, Y, Z
   Need a valid word H _ S _ _.
   Example: HUMPS – but P is allowed, M is allowed, U is allowed.
   HUMPS is valid.

Pattern 2: _ H S _ _
   Need a valid word _ H S _ _.
   Example: B H S _ _ – no common word.
   D H S _ _ – no.
   G H S _ _ – no.
   M H S _ _ – no.
   P H S _ _ – no.
   No obvious common words fit.

Pattern 3: _ _ H _ S
   Need a valid word _ _ H _ S.
   Example: B U H A S – invalid.
   D U H A S – invalid.
   M U H A S – invalid.
   F U H A S – invalid.
   G U H A S – invalid.
   Not finding common words here easily.

Thus the only promising candidate is HUMPS.

Verify HUMPS:
- Letters: H, U, M, P, S – none are in the excluded set.
- Contains S and H.
- Positions:
   H at 1 – allowed (was only forbidden at 2 and 5)  
   U at 2 – allowed  
   M at 3 – allowed  
   P at 4 – allowed  
   S at 5 – allowed (was only forbidden at 1 and 4)  

So HUMPS meets every constraint and is a valid 5-letter English word.

From the feedback so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x): C, R, A, N, E, L, O, T, W, I, K, P  
Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): S, H, M  
- H cannot be in positions 1, 2, 5 (from guesses 2, 3, 4) → must be in position 3 or 4.  
- S cannot be in positions 1, 4, 5 (from guesses 2, 3, 4) → must be in position 2 or 3.  
- M cannot be in position 3 (from guess 4) → must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.  

We also know U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).

So the word structure is:  
_ U _ _ _ with the remaining letters drawn from {H, S, M} plus any other letters not yet ruled out (B, D, F, G, J, Q, V, X, Y, Z).

But we only have three letters (H, S, M) that are definitely in the word, and they must occupy the remaining three slots (positions 1, 3, 5) because position 2 is already U.

Let’s list the possible positions for H, S, M:
- H: position 3 or 4 (from earlier constraints)  
- S: position 2 or 3 (but position 2 is U) → must be position 3  
- M: any of 1, 4, 5 (but S must be at 3, so M can be 1, 4, or 5)

Since S must be at position 3, the word becomes:  
_ U S _ _  

Now H and M must fit into positions 1, 4, 5 with these constraints:
- H cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (already excluded) → can only be 4 or 5  
- M can be any of 1, 4, 5 (but must be unique)

We also need one more letter from the remaining pool (B, D, F, G, J, Q, V, X, Y, Z).

Let’s enumerate the possible combinations:

1. Position 1: M, Position 4: H, Position 5: [extra letter]  
   Word: M U S H _ → need a valid 5-letter word ending with an allowed letter.  
   “MUSHY” is valid and uses Y (allowed).

2. Position 1: [extra letter], Position 4: H, Position 5: M  
   Word: _ U S H M → need a valid starting letter.  
   “DUSHM” is invalid; “FUSHM” is invalid; no common word.

3. Position 1: H, Position 4: M, Position 5: [extra letter]  
   Word: H U S M _ → “HUSKY” uses K (already excluded) and Y is allowed, but K is out.  
   “HUSMY” uses Y but is not a common word.

4. Position 1: [extra letter], Position 4: M, Position 5: H  
   Word: _ U S M H → need a valid starting letter.  
   “BUSHM” invalid; “GUSHM” invalid.

The only valid common word fitting all constraints is MUSHY.

Check MUSHY:
- Letters: M, U, S, H, Y  
- U is confirmed at position 2 (✓)  
- S is at position 3 (must be)  
- H is at position 4 (allowed)  
- M is at position 1 (allowed)  
- Y is a new letter not yet tested, which is fine.

Thus, MUSHY is the logical next guess.
