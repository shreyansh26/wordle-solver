### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use some of these. 

Looking at potential 5-letter combinations, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and avoids duplicates. This gives us maximum coverage for the first guess to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use some of these. 

Looking at potential 5-letter combinations, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and avoids duplicates. This gives us maximum coverage for the first guess to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(-): O is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- S(x): S is not in the word.

So we know:
1. Letters definitely present: A, O
2. Letters definitely absent: R, S, E
3. A is not in position 1
4. O is not in position 3

I want a new word that:
- Contains A and O
- Does not contain R, S, E
- Places A somewhere other than position 1
- Places O somewhere other than position 3

Common letters left to try: T, N, I, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

A good candidate is ""ADMON"":

4. We still need to place the letters A and O plus three unknown letters (all different from the forbidden set).

A good next word should:
- Use A and O in fresh positions.

We now know:
- Letters in the word and their positions: C (1), O (2), A (3), and the last two letters are unknown.
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, S, E, D, M, N, T, Y, B, I.

So the pattern is C O A _ _ with two unknown letters from the remaining set: F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for real 5-letter words that start with COA and end with two letters from the remaining set:
- COAFS – not a word.
- COAGS – not a word.
- COAHS – not a word.
- COAKS – not a word.
- COAL – already ruled out.
- COAMP – not a word.
- COAPT – contains T (excluded).
- COAVS – not a word.
- COAWs – not a word.
- COAX – already ruled out (Y excluded, X is allowed but COAX is 5 letters and A is already in position 3).
- COAZ – not a word.

Wait, let me re-examine the remaining letters more carefully. The only two positions left are 4 and 5, and the letters must be from F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Real words starting with COA:
- COALA – contains A again (already in position 3), but A is already placed.
- COAS – too short.
- COATS – contains T (excluded).
- COAX – 4 letters.
- COAZ – not a word.

Looking deeper, the only real word that fits is ""COALA"", but it repeats the letter A which is already in position 3. However, the puzzle allows repeated letters if they appear multiple times in the word.

But ""COALA"" is a valid word (a young kangaroo). Let me check if it's acceptable given the constraints:
- C O A L A – letters used: C, O, A, L, A.
- L is from the allowed set (not excluded).
- A is already confirmed in position 3, and the word COALA is valid.

Therefore, COALA is the next logical guess.
