### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give us good information about which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must appear somewhere in positions 2-5).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A somewhere (but not at the start).
- Does not contain R, O, S, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has A (not in the first position).
2. Does not have R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed).

Let me try a word like ""PLAID"":
- P, L, I, D are all new letters.
- A is in position 2 (so we can see if A is in position 2 or 3 or 4 or 5).
- Doesn't use R, O, S, E.

""PLAID"" seems like a strong second guess.

From the two guesses so far:

Guess 1: arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
- A is in the word but not in position 1.  
- R, O, S, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: plaid → P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(-)  
- P, L, I are not in the word.  
- A is still in the word but not in position 3 (because it was marked “-” in position 3).  
- D is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A (positions 2, 4, or 5)  
- Contains D (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4)  
- Does not contain P, L, I, R, O, S, E

Remaining common consonants: T, N, C, M, G, H, B, F, K, Y, W, V, Z, X, Q, J  
Remaining common vowels: U

I’ll pick a word that uses A and D and avoids all the letters already ruled out.  
A good candidate is “CANDY”:  
- C, N, Y are new letters.  
- A is in position 2 (still within allowed positions).  
- D is in position 3 (allowed).  
- Doesn’t use any of the disallowed letters.

Therefore, “CANDY” is a strong next guess.

From the feedback so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - R, O, S, E are out.

2. plaid → P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(-)  
   - P, L, I are out.  
   - A is still in the word but not in position 3.  
   - D is in the word but not in position 5.

3. candy → C(x) A(✓) N(x) D(✓) Y(✓)  
   - C and N are out.  
   - A is now confirmed in position 2.  
   - D is confirmed in position 4.  
   - Y is confirmed in position 5.

So the pattern so far is:
_ A _ D Y
With letters still allowed: A (only in position 2), D (only in position 4), Y (only in position 5), and the first and third positions must be filled with letters not yet ruled out.

Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, C, N.

Remaining common consonants: T, G, B, F, K, M, H, V, W, Z, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (since A is already placed).

We need a 5-letter word that fits _ A _ D Y and uses allowed letters. Possible candidates:
- B A D D Y (but D is already in position 4, so BAD DY doesn't fit)
- G A M D Y (M is allowed)
- T A M D Y (M is allowed)
- B A U D Y (U is allowed)
- G A U D Y (G and U are allowed)

Looking at these, ""GAMDY"" isn't a valid word, ""TAMDY"" isn't valid, but ""GAUDY"" is a valid word. Let's check:
- G, A, U, D, Y: all letters are allowed, and it fits the pattern _ A _ D Y with A in position 2, D in 4, Y in 5.

Therefore, ""GAUDY"" is the next logical guess.
