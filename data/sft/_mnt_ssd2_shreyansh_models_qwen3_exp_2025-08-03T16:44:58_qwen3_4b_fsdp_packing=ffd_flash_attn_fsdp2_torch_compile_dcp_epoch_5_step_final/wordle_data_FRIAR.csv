### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the amount of information gained. A good starting word should contain frequently used letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

One of the most effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of common letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it has common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E).

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it strikes a good balance.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must appear somewhere else: positions 2-5).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Contains the letter A somewhere (but not in position 1).
- Does not contain O, S, E.

I need a word that:
1. Has R in position 2.
2. Has A somewhere (positions 3-5).
3. Does not use O, S, E.
4. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible common letters left to try: T, I, N, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let me think of a word that fits these constraints. Good candidates:
- TRAIN (but T and A are in positions 1 and 3 - A is in position 3, which is allowed, but T is new)
- GRAIN (G is new, but A is in position 3)
- TRAIL (T, A, I, L - good coverage)

I'll choose ""TRAIN"" because it uses T and I which are common, and A in position 3 is allowed by the feedback.

Wait - does TRAIN use any forbidden letters? No, it uses T, R, A, I, N - all allowed.

Another check: A is in position 3 (allowed since it's not position 1), R is in position 2 (correct), and no O/S/E.

So TRAIN seems perfect.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the amount of information gained. A good starting word should contain frequently used letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

One of the most effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of common letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it has common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E).

Another check: A is in position 3 (allowed since it's not position 1), R is in position 2 (correct), and no O/S/E.

So TRAIN seems perfect.

From the two guesses so far:

Guess 1: AROSE  
Feedback: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
→ R is locked in position 2.  
→ A is somewhere else (positions 3-5).  
→ O, S, E, T, N are out.

Guess 2: TRAIN  
Feedback: T(x) R(✓) A(-) I(-) N(x)  
→ Confirms R in position 2.  
→ A is still in the word but now we know it’s **not** in position 3.  
→ I is in the word but **not** in position 4.  
→ T, N are already out.

So far we have:  
Pattern: _ R _ _ _  
Letters known to be present: A (somewhere 4 or 5), I (somewhere 1, 3, or 5).  
Letters known to be absent: O, S, E, T, N.

Remaining common letters to try: C, D, G, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We need a word that:
- Has R in position 2.  
- Contains A (position 4 or 5).  
- Contains I (position 1, 3, or 5).  
- Uses only allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- CRIAR → invalid (not a common word).  
- DRIAR → invalid.  
- GRIAR → invalid.  
- CRIAD → invalid (not a word).  
- FRIAR → uses F (allowed) and fits: F R I A D? No, needs 5 letters.  
- FRIAD → invalid.  
- CRIAD → invalid.  
- Let’s list valid words:  
  – FRIAR → F R I A R → but A is position 4, I is position 3 → valid.  
  – CRIAR → not valid.  
  – DRIAR → not valid.  
  – BRIAR → B R I A R → valid word.  
  – GRIAR → not valid.  
  – HRIAR → not valid.  
  – KRIAR → not valid.  
  – BRIAR is a valid word (grows along walls), uses B (allowed), R in 2, I in 3, A in 4, R in 5.

Check constraints:
- B, R, I, A, R → all allowed.  
- A is in position 4 (allowed).  
- I is in position 3 (allowed).  
- No forbidden letters.

Thus, BRIAR is a perfect next guess.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - R is in position 2 and is correct.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.

2. TRAIN → T(x) R(✓) A(-) I(-) N(x)
   - R is still correct in position 2.
   - A is not in position 3.
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.

3. BRIAR → B(x) R(✓) I(✓) A(✓) R(✓)
   - R is confirmed in position 2 and 5.
   - I is confirmed in position 3.
   - A is confirmed in position 4.
   - B and the second R were marked x, so position 1 and 5 cannot be B or R (but R is already fixed in 5).

So the pattern is now: _ R I A R (with R fixed in position 5 and I in position 3, A in position 4).

We only need to determine the first letter. The remaining letters must be from the alphabet excluding: O, S, E, T, N, B.

Common first letters left: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for 5-letter words ending with ""R"" (since R is in position 5), the most common endings are:

- ""C"" could make ""CR..."" but ""CR"" is not a common start.
- ""D"" could make ""DR..."" like DRIPA (not a word).
- ""F"" could make ""FR..."" but FR is not a common start.
- ""G"" could make ""GR..."" like GRIM (but needs 5 letters).
- ""H"" could make ""HR..."" not common.
- ""K"" could make ""KR..."" not common.
- ""L"" could make ""LR..."" not common.
- ""M"" could make ""MR..."" like MR. but needs a word.
- ""P"" could make ""PR..."" like PRIMA (but ends with A, not R).
- ""C"" could make ""CR..."" but CR is not a common start.

Wait, the word must be _ R I A R. So the only variable is the first letter. Let me think of common words ending with ""R"" and with ""I A"" in positions 3-4.

Possible words:
- ""F R I A R"" → FRIAR (valid word, uses F which is allowed)
- ""C R I A R"" → not a valid word.
- ""D R I A R"" → not valid.
- ""G R I A R"" → not valid.
- ""K R I A R"" → not valid.
- ""L R I A R"" → not valid.
- ""M R I A R"" → not valid.
- ""P R I A R"" → not valid.

The only valid word fitting the pattern is FRIAR. Let me check:
- F is allowed (not in forbidden list).
- R is in position 2 and 5 (correct).
- I is in position 3 (correct).
- A is in position 4 (correct).
- R is in position 5 (correct).

Thus, FRIAR is the only possible word left.
