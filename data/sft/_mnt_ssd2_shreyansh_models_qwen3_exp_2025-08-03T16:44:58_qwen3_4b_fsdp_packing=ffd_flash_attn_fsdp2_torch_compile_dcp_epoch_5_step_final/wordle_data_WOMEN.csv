### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word uses as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it includes A, R, O, S, and E - five of the most common letters. This gives maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word.

N(-) – N is in the word but NOT in position 3.

F(x) – F is not in the word.

So now we know:

Letters in word, with positions:
- O at position 2
- E at position 4
- N somewhere (but not position 3 or 5)

Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, C, G, F

N must fit in either position 1 or 3 (since it can't be 3 or 5 from feedback).

Let’s list possible placements:
- N in position 1: N O _ E _
- N in position 3: _ O N E _

We need to fill the remaining blanks with letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, S, C, G, F).

Common remaining letters: B, D, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, Y, etc.

Let’s look for valid 5-letter words in both skeletons.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word uses as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it includes A, R, O, S, and E - five of the most common letters. This gives maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

Letters we now know are in the word: O and E (somewhere other than positions 3 and 5, respectively).  
Letters we know are not in the word: A, R, S.

We need a word that:
1. Contains O and E.
2. Does not contain A, R, or S.
3. Places O and E somewhere other than positions 3 and 5.

A good candidate is “OCEAN”:
- It has O and E.
- It lacks A, R, or S.
- O is in position 1 (not 3), and E is in position 4 (not 5).

Let’s try it.

→ N is in position 5.  
→ O is in word but not in position 1 or 3.

So far:  
Known letters in word: O, E, N (positions: N at 5, O not at 1/3, E not at 3/5)  
Known letters out: A, R, S, C  

Remaining common letters to test: T, L, I, D, G, U, M, P, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with N (position 5).  
- Contains O and E somewhere (positions not excluded yet).  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.  

Candidate structure: _ _ _ _ N  
Possible placements:  
- O can be in 2 or 4 (since it’s not in 1, 3).  
- E can be in 2, 4 (since it’s not in 3, 5).  

Let’s try “TOWER”:  
- T, O, W, E, R  
→ R is already out → discard.

“GONEF”:  
- G, O, N, E, F  
→ N is in correct spot (5), O in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), G and F still possible.

A good candidate is “OCEAN”:
- It has O and E.
- It lacks A, R, or S.
- O is in position 1 (not 3), and E is in position 4 (not 5).

Let’s try it.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: OCEAN -> FEEDBACK: O(-) C(x) E(-) A(x) N(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE  
Feedback: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)  
→ Letters in word: O, E (but not in positions 3, 5)  
→ Letters out: A, R, S  

Guess 2: OCEAN  
Feedback: O(-) C(x) E(-) A(x) N(✓)  
→ N is in position 5.  
→ O is in word but not in position 1 or 3.  
→ E is in word but not in position 3 or 5.  
→ C and A are out.  

So far:  
Known letters in word: O, E, N (positions: N at 5, O not at 1/3, E not at 3/5)  
Known letters out: A, R, S, C  

Remaining common letters to test: T, L, I, D, G, U, M, P, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with N (position 5).  
- Contains O and E somewhere (positions not excluded yet).  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.  

Candidate structure: _ _ _ _ N  
Possible placements:  
- O can be in 2 or 4 (since it’s not in 1, 3).  
- E can be in 2, 4 (since it’s not in 3, 5).  

Let’s try “TOWER”:  
- T, O, W, E, R  
→ R is already out → discard.

“GONEF”:  
- G, O, N, E, F  
→ N is in correct spot (5), O in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), G and F still possible.  
→ No forbidden letters.  

Let’s test GONEF.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: OCEAN -> FEEDBACK: O(-) C(x) E(-) A(x) N(✓)
Guess 3: GONEF -> FEEDBACK: G(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) F(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's digest the new feedback from GONEF:

G(x) – G is not in the word.  
O(✓) – O is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).  
N(-) – N is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
E(✓) – E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4).  
F(x) – F is not in the word.

So now we know:

Letters in word, with positions:
- O at position 2
- E at position 4
- N somewhere (but not position 3 or 5)

Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, C, G, F

Word skeleton so far:
_ O _ E _

N must fit in either position 1 or 3 (since it can't be 3 or 5 from feedback).

Let’s list possible placements:
- N in position 1: N O _ E _
- N in position 3: _ O N E _

We need to fill the remaining blanks with letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, S, C, G, F).

Common remaining letters: B, D, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, Y, etc.

Let’s look for valid 5-letter words in both skeletons.

1. N O _ E _  
   Possible: N O B E L, N O D E L, N O I E T, etc.  
   Real word: NOBEL

2. _ O N E _  
   Possible: B O N E T, D O N E T, H O N E T, etc.  
   Real word: HONEY (but H is still possible)

Between NOBEL and HONEY, both fit the constraints. NOBEL uses B and L; HONEY uses H and Y. Both are valid guesses. NOBEL seems slightly more balanced.

Let's go with NOBEL.

Guess 2: OCEAN -> FEEDBACK: O(-) C(x) E(-) A(x) N(✓)
Guess 3: GONEF -> FEEDBACK: G(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) F(x)
Guess 4: NOBEL -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's process the latest feedback from NOBEL:

N(-) – N is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
O(✓) – O is locked in position 2.  
B(x) – B is not in the word.  
E(✓) – E is locked in position 4.  
L(x) – L is not in the word.

Current knowledge:
- Positions: _ O _ E _
- Letters in word: O, E, N (N must be in position 3 or 5, but feedback says it's not in 1 or 3 from earlier, so N must be in position 5)
- Letters ruled out: A, R, S, C, G, F, B, L

So the word must be: _ O _ E N

Now we need to find a valid 5-letter word that fits this pattern. The first and third letters must be from remaining possible letters (not yet ruled out: D, H, I, K, M, P, T, U, Y, etc.).

Possible candidates:
- D O M E N (but DOMEN is not a valid word)
- H O M E N (valid word)
- P O K E N (but POKEN is not valid)
- T O K E N (valid word)
- M O T E N (not valid)
- P O K E N (invalid)
- Y O K E N (invalid)

Between HOME and TOKEN, both fit. HOME uses H and M; TOKEN uses T and K. Both are valid. HOME seems more common.

Let's go with HOME.
