### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use words with distinct letters that appear frequently. 

One such word is ""RAISE"" - it contains R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters and appear in many 5-letter words. This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, B, M, P, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A is confirmed and E, I are out)

I'll try to pick a word with A in a different position and use other common letters. ""ADMON"" comes to mind (A, D, M, O, N), but O is less common. ""PLANT"" is another option (P, L, A, N, T) - uses A in position 3, and P, L, N, T are all common and not yet tested.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. \n\nI\'ll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use words with distinct letters that appear frequently. \n\nOne such word is ""RAISE"" - it contains R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters and appear in many 5-letter words. This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on RAISE:\n- R: not in the word (x)\n- A: in the word but wrong position (-)\n- I: not in the word (x)\n- S: not in the word (x)\n- E: not in the word (x)\n\nSo we know:\n1.

""ADMON"" comes to mind (A, D, M, O, N), but O is less common. ""PLANT"" is another option (P, L, A, N, T) - uses A in position 3, and P, L, N, T are all common and not yet tested.\n\n""PLANT"" seems like a strong next guess.\n\n<guess>PLANT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(✓) A(-) N(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two rounds of feedback:\n\n1.

Current knowledge after three guesses:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)  
   - A is in the word, but not in position 2.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(✓) A(-) N(x) T(x)  
   - L is fixed in position 2.  
   - A is still in the word but not in position 3.

3. CLOAK → C(x) L(✓) O(-) A(-) K(x)  
   - L remains in position 2.  
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - A is still in the word but not in position 4.

Combining these:
- Pattern: _ L _ _ _
- Letters known to be in the word: A, O  
- Letters definitely absent: R, I, S, E, P, N, T, C, K
- Possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4, 5  (but feedback shows it is NOT in 2,3,4)  
  Wait:  
  - From RAISE: not in 2  
  - From PLANT: not in 3  
  - From CLOAK: not in 4  
  So A must be in position 1 or 5.

- O is in the word but not in position 3, and not in any other position ruled out so far.  
  So O could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.  But position 2 is L, so 1, 4, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- L in position 2  
- Either A in 1 or 5  
- O somewhere (not 3)  
- No other letters from the excluded set.

Possible candidates:
- A L O _ _  → but A is in 1, L in 2, O in 3 is disallowed (O is in word but not in 3)  
- _ L A O _ → but A is in 3, which is disallowed  
- _ L O A _ → A in 4, disallowed  
- _ L _ O A → A in 5, O in 4:  word like “GLOAM” (but M is allowed)  
- A L _ O _ → A in 1, O in 4:  word like “ALLOY” (but Y is allowed)

Let’s pick “ALLOY”:
- A in 1 (allowed)  
- L in 2 (fixed)  
- L in 3 (allowed, not yet excluded)  
- O in 4 (allowed)  
- Y in 5 (allowed)  

No forbidden letters, and it tests A in position 1 and O in position 4.
