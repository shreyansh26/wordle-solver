### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I need to make a strategic choice. The best starting words typically:
1. Use common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Include common consonants
3. Avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain

Some strong candidates include:
- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E - very common letters)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E - good coverage)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E - good too)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it hits many common letters and vowels, giving good initial coverage.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2  
- O(x) → O is not in the word  
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4  
- E(x) → E is not in the word  

So far we know:
- Letters that must appear somewhere: R, S
- Letters that can be excluded: A, O, E

I need a word that:
1. Contains R and S
2. Doesn’t use A, O, E
3. Places R and S in positions different from 2 and 4 respectively (so R can be in 1,3,4,5; S can be in 1,2,3,5)

Good remaining consonants and vowels: I, U, D, L, N, T, Y, etc.

I’ll look for a word that satisfies these constraints and also introduces new common letters to narrow the possibilities quickly.

A good candidate is “DRUIS”:
- Contains R and S
- Doesn’t use A, O, E
- R is in position 3, S in position 5 (both positions are allowed by the feedback)
- Adds new letters D, U, I to test

However, “DRUIS” is not a valid English word. 

Another candidate is “TRUST”:
- T, R, U, S, T
- Contains R and S
- R in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2), so this is invalid.

Next, “SURGE” is invalid because it contains E.

“CRISP”:
- C, R, I, S, P
- Contains R and S
- R in position 2 (invalid)

“FIRST”:
- F, I, R, S, T
- R in position 3 (allowed), S in position 4 (but feedback says S is not in position 4), so invalid.

“GRIST”:
- G, R, I, S, T
- R in position 2 (invalid)

“BRISK”:
- B, R, I, S, K
- R in position 2 (invalid)

“CRUST”:

“TRUST” already ruled out.

“DIRTY”:

- Contains R but not S, so invalid.

“SPIRE”:
- S, P, I, R, E
- Contains S and R
- S in position 1 (allowed), R in position 4 (allowed)

- E is excluded (from feedback), so this is valid.

Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I need to make a strategic choice. The best starting words typically:
1. Use common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Include common consonants
3. Avoid repeating letters to maximize information gain

Some strong candidates include:
- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E - very common letters)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E - good coverage)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E - good too)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it hits many common letters and vowels, giving good initial coverage.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2  
- O(x) → O is not in the word  
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4  
- E(x) → E is not in the word  

So far we know:
- Letters that must appear somewhere: R, S
- Letters that can be excluded: A, O, E

I need a word that:
1. Contains R and S
2. Doesn’t use A, O, E
3. Places R and S in positions different from 2 and 4 respectively (so R can be in 1,3,4,5; S can be in 1,2,3,5)

Good remaining consonants and vowels: I, U, D, L, N, T, Y, etc.

I’ll look for a word that satisfies these constraints and also introduces new common letters to narrow the possibilities quickly.

A good candidate is “DRUIS”:
- Contains R and S
- Doesn’t use A, O, E
- R is in position 3, S in position 5 (both positions are allowed by the feedback)
- Adds new letters D, U, I to test

However, “DRUIS” is not a valid English word. 

Another candidate is “TRUST”:
- T, R, U, S, T
- Contains R and S
- R in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2), so this is invalid.

Next, “SURGE” is invalid because it contains E.

“CRISP”:
- C, R, I, S, P
- Contains R and S
- R in position 2 (invalid)

“FIRST”:
- F, I, R, S, T
- R in position 3 (allowed), S in position 4 (but feedback says S is not in position 4), so invalid.

“GRIST”:
- G, R, I, S, T
- R in position 2 (invalid)

“BRISK”:
- B, R, I, S, K
- R in position 2 (invalid)

“CRUST”:
- C, R, U, S, T
- R in position 2 (invalid)

“TRUST” already ruled out.

“DIRTY”:
- D, I, R, T, Y
- Contains R but not S, so invalid.

“SPIRE”:
- S, P, I, R, E
- Contains S and R
- S in position 1 (allowed), R in position 4 (allowed)
- Adds P, I to test
- E is excluded (from feedback), so this is valid.

Thus, “SPIRE” is a good next guess.

Current constraints after two guesses:

Letters we KNOW:
- S is in position 1 (✓)
- P is in position 2 (✓)
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- R is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

Letters we KNOW are NOT in the word:
A, O, E

Letters that must appear:
S (fixed at pos 1), P (fixed at pos 2), I (somewhere else), R (somewhere else)

Possible positions left for I and R: positions 3, 4, 5 (but they can't be in the positions already ruled out).

Since I cannot be in position 3, it must be in 4 or 5.
Since R cannot be in position 4, it must be in 3 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with ""SP"" and contains I and R in the remaining positions.

Possible combinations:
- SP _ I R
- SP _ R I
- SP I _ R
- SP R _ I

But:
- Position 3: if R is here, then I must be in 4 or 5
- Position 4: if I is here, then R must be in 3 or 5
- Position 5: can hold either I or R

Let's think of valid English words that fit:

SP _ I R: ""SPHIR"" - not a word
SP _ R I: ""SPGRI"" - not a word
SP I _ R: ""SPIKR"" - not a word
SP R _ I: ""SPR I"" - ""SPR"" is not a common start

Wait, let's think differently: we have S P _ _ _ and need to place I and R plus one more consonant.

Possible word: ""SPORT"" - but O is excluded
""SPRIT"" - T is allowed, but does it fit?
S P R I T: positions 1=S, 2=P, 3=R, 4=I, 5=T
Check constraints:
- S in pos 1 ✓
- P in pos 2 ✓
- R in pos 3 (allowed, since R can't be in pos 4)
- I in pos 4 (allowed, since I can't be in pos 3)
- T is new, which is fine
- No excluded letters (A,O,E)

""SPRIT"" is a valid English word meaning ""a stream of light or heat"".

This seems perfect.

2. P is in position 2 (✓)

5. T is not in the word (x)

We need a 5-letter word starting with “SPRI” and whose last letter is not T, A, O, or E (already ruled out).

Possible last letters (common consonants not yet used): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common English words starting with SPRI:
- SPRIB – not valid
- SPRIC – not valid
- SPRID – not valid
- SPRIG – not valid
- PRISM – but M is 5th spot, word is SPRIM? No.
- SPRIT – already tried
- SPRIK – not valid
- SPRIY – not valid

Wait, let me list valid 5-letter words starting with SPRI:
- SPRI_ – only common one is SPRIT, which we tried. Others are uncommon or invalid.

Actually, the standard dictionary word is SPRIT (but T is excluded).

Looking for other possibilities:
- SPRIK – not a word
- SPRIB – not a word
- SPRIC – not a word
- SPRIY – not a word

It appears the only standard word fitting is SPRIT, but T is invalid. This suggests I may have missed another.

Wait, let me double-check: “SPRIG” is a word (a small stream), but G is allowed and not yet ruled out.

SPRIG:
1. S P R I G
2. T is not in the word (good)
3. G is a new letter to test
4. All positions match the constraints:
   - S(1), P(2), R(3), I(4), G(5)

“SPRIG” is a valid 5-letter word meaning a small stream or a sprig of ivy.
