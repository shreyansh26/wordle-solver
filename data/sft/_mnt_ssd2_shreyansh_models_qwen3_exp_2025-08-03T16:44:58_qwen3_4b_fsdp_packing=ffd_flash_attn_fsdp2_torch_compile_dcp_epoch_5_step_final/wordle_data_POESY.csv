### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage of high-frequency letters in both position and presence.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(✓) → S is in the word and in position 4.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word must contain S (position 4) and E (somewhere else) and O (somewhere else).
- Word does not contain A or R.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- S in position 4.
- E and O somewhere else (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 for E; positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 for O).
- No A or R.

Possible candidates could be:
- OESSE (but double S might be unlikely)
- SOEET (but has double E and T is unknown)
- POETS (but has P which is less common)
- LOOSE (but has double O and L is unknown)
- HOSES (but has H which is less common)
- DOSES (but has D which is less common)

Looking for common words with these constraints, ""POETS"" seems reasonable as it has:
- P (unknown, but common)
- O (in position 2, not 3 - satisfies feedback)
- E (in position 3, not 5 - satisfies feedback)
- T (unknown)
- S (in position 4 - matches feedback)

This gives us new letters (P, T) to test while satisfying all constraints.

Current confirmed facts:
- S must be in position 4 (from AROSE).
- E, O, P are in the word but their exact positions are unknown (from POETS).
- T is not in the word (from POETS).
- Letters not in the word: A, R, T.

We have:
Position 1: P (✓) – so P is correct here.
Position 2: O (✓) – so O is correct here.
Position 3: E (✓) – so E is correct here.
Position 4: S (✓) – so S is correct here.
Position 5: T (x) – so T is not in the word, and the fifth letter must be something else.

But wait – the feedback for POETS says:
P(✓) O(✓) E(✓) T(x) S(-)

The dash (-) on S means S is in the word but NOT in position 5. However, we already know from AROSE that S is in position 4, so this simply confirms that S is indeed in position 4 and not elsewhere. So the only confirmed letter in POETS is P, O, E in their respective positions, and S is still locked in position 4. The fifth letter must be something new.

So the word structure is:
P _ _ S _

With the remaining letters to fill positions 2, 3, and 5. But positions 2 and 3 are already occupied by O and E from POETS feedback. Wait, let me re-examine:

The POETS feedback:
P(✓) O(✓) E(✓) T(x) S(-)

This means:
- P is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- T is not in the word.
- S is in the word but not in position 5 (but we know from AROSE it's in position 4), so this is consistent.

Thus, the word must be:
P O E S _

Now we just need to find a valid 5-letter word that starts with POES. The only common English word that fits is ""POESY"" (though this is less common), or ""POES"" plus a letter. Actually, the only standard word is ""POESY"" but that's 5 letters. Let me check:

POESY - P O E S Y

This fits all constraints:
- P in position 1 (✓)
- O in position 2 (✓)
- E in position 3 (✓)
- S in position 4 (✓)
- Y is new letter (not tested yet)

So the next logical guess is POESY.
