### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage of high-frequency letters in both position and presence.

Summary of what we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, M, U, D.
2. Letters that ARE in the word, but not yet fixed: O and L.
   - O is not in position 3.
   - L is not in position 4.

So the secret word contains both O and L, and they must be placed in positions other than 3 (for O) and 4 (for L).

Letters still available: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses both O and L exactly once each.
- Doesn’t use any of the letters already ruled out.
- Places O and L in allowed positions (O ≠ 3, L ≠ 4).

Possible patterns:
- O can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- L can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

Let’s try to pick a word that places these letters in allowed spots and uses other common remaining letters. A good candidate is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all still possible.
- O is in position 1 (allowed).
- L is not used, but we can check if this helps narrow things further.

Wait, “POINT” doesn’t use L at all. That’s bad because we need to confirm L’s placement. Let’s try “CLOPS”:
- C, P, S are still possible, but S is already ruled out (from AROSE). So this is invalid.

Next candidate: “CLOAK” – but A and K are still possible, yet A is ruled out. Not good.

Try “CLOPS” again – S is ruled out. So scratch that.

Better candidate: “CLOPS” is out due to S.

Another candidate: “CLOBS” – B and S; S is out.

Try “CLOBS” is invalid.

Next: “CLOBS” no.

Try “CLOBS” is invalid.

Let’s try “CLOBS” is invalid.

Wait, let’s list valid letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, Y, Z.

We need both O and L. Let’s try to place O and L in allowed spots and fill the rest with other available letters.

One valid placement: O in position 2, L in position 3. Then the word would be _ O L _ _.

Possible letters for other positions: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, Y, Z.

Alternative placement: O in position 4, L in position 2. Then word would be _ L _ O _.

Possible: C L O C K – but O would be in 3, which is invalid.

C L O C K invalid.

Alternative: O in position 5, L in position 2. Then _ L _ _ O.

Possible: B L I N O – but I is possible, N is possible, B is possible.

“BLINO” – is this a valid word? Not really.

“CLINO” – not valid.

“FLINT” – but O is in 5, L in 2. F, L, I, N, T. That’s valid.

“FLINT”:
- F, L, I, N, T.
- L is in position 2 (allowed, since L only needs to be ≠4).
- O is not used here. We need to include O.

So FLINT is invalid.

Alternative: O in position 1, L in position 2. Then O L _ _ _.

Possible: O L D N T – but D and N, T are possible, yet D is ruled out.

“OLIVE” – but E is ruled out.

Possible: C L O C O – but C, L, O, yet C is possible, but O is already in 5.

“CLCOO” – not a word.

“FLCOO” – not a word.

“GLCOO” – not a word.

“OBILY” – not a word.

“ONILY” – not a word.

“OVILY” – not a word.

“OWILY” – not a word.

“OZILY” – not a word.

This is tricky. Let’s list all valid 5-letter words that contain both O and L, don’t use ruled-out letters (A, R, S, E, M, U, D), and place O and L in allowed positions.

Valid letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- “BLOKE” – but E is out.
- “BLOCK” – K is possible, but O is in 2, L in 3. This is valid.
  - B, L, O, C, K.
  - O is in 2 (allowed, since O only needs to be ≠3).
  - L is in 3 (allowed, since L only needs to be ≠4).

“BLOCK” seems to fit all criteria.

Let’s verify:
- Letters used: B, L, O, C, K.
- None of A, R, S, E, M, U, D are used.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- L is in position 3 (allowed).

Thus, “BLOCK” is a valid next guess.

Hmm, these are all invalid or not words.

Let’s try O in position 5, L in position 3. Then _ _ L _ O.

Possible: C L O C O – but C, L, O, yet C is possible, but O is already in 5.

“CLCOO” – not a word.

“FLCOO” – not a word.

“OBILY” – not a word.

“ONILY” – not a word.

“OVILY” – not a word.

“OWILY” – not a word.

“OZILY” – not a word.

This is tricky. Let’s list all valid 5-letter words that contain both O and L, don’t use ruled-out letters (A, R, S, E, M, U, D), and place O and L in allowed positions.

Valid letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- “BLOKE” – but E is out.
- “BLOCK” – K is possible, but O is in 2, L in 3. This is valid.
  - B, L, O, C, K.
  - O is in 2 (allowed, since O only needs to be ≠3).
  - L is in 3 (allowed, since L only needs to be ≠4).

“BLOCK” seems to fit all criteria.

Let’s verify:
- Letters used: B, L, O, C, K.
- None of A, R, S, E, M, U, D are used.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- L is in position 3 (allowed).

Thus, “BLOCK” is a valid next guess.",Guess 3: BLOCK -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(-) O(-) C(x) K(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage of high-frequency letters in both position and presence.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O, but not in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O (but not in position 3).
2. Doesn't use A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good candidates: 
- DOING (O in position 2)
- COUNT (O in position 3 - but this is invalid because O was in position 3 in AROSE and marked as wrong position)
- MOULD (O in position 2)
- COULD (O in position 2)

I'll choose ""MOULD"" as it uses M, O, U, L, D - all common letters not yet ruled out.

Summary of what we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, M, U, D.
2. Letters that ARE in the word, but not yet fixed: O and L.
   - O is not in position 3.
   - L is not in position 4.

So the secret word contains both O and L, and they must be placed in positions other than 3 (for O) and 4 (for L).

Letters still available: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses both O and L exactly once each.
- Doesn’t use any of the letters already ruled out.
- Places O and L in allowed positions (O ≠ 3, L ≠ 4).

Possible patterns:
- O can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- L can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

Let’s try to pick a word that places these letters in allowed spots and uses other common remaining letters. A good candidate is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all still possible.
- O is in position 1 (allowed).
- L is not used, but we can check if this helps narrow things further.

Wait, “POINT” doesn’t use L at all. That’s bad because we need to confirm L’s placement. Let’s try “CLOPS”:
- C, P, S are still possible, but S is already ruled out (from AROSE). So this is invalid.

Next candidate: “CLOAK” – but A and K are still possible, yet A is ruled out. Not good.

Try “CLOPS” again – S is ruled out. So scratch that.

Better candidate: “CLOPS” is out due to S.

Another candidate: “CLOBS” – B and S; S is out.

Try “CLOBS” is invalid.

Next: “CLOBS” no.

Try “CLOBS” is invalid.

Let’s try “CLOBS” is invalid.

Wait, let’s list valid letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, Y, Z.

We need both O and L. Let’s try to place O and L in allowed spots and fill the rest with other available letters.

One valid placement: O in position 2, L in position 3. Then the word would be _ O L _ _.

Possible letters for other positions: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, Y, Z.

Let’s try “BOLTS” – but S is out.

“COLTS” – S out.

“GOLTS” – S out.

“HOLTS” – S out.

“JOLTS” – S out.

“KOLTS” – S out.

“POLTS” – S out.

“TOLKS” – S out.

“VOLKS” – S out.

“WOLKS” – S out.

“YOLKS” – S out.

Hmm, S is a problem. Let’s avoid S.

Alternative placement: O in position 4, L in position 2. Then word would be _ L _ O _.

Possible: C L O C K – but O would be in 3, which is invalid.

C L O C K invalid.

Alternative: O in position 5, L in position 2. Then _ L _ _ O.

Possible: B L I N O – but I is possible, N is possible, B is possible.

“BLINO” – is this a valid word? Not really.

“CLINO” – not valid.

“FLINT” – but O is in 5, L in 2. F, L, I, N, T. That’s valid.

“FLINT”:
- F, L, I, N, T.
- L is in position 2 (allowed, since L only needs to be ≠4).
- O is not used here. We need to include O.

So FLINT is invalid.

Alternative: O in position 1, L in position 2. Then O L _ _ _.

Possible: O L D N T – but D and N, T are possible, yet D is ruled out.

“OLIVE” – but E is ruled out.

“ONION” – but N, I, O, N. O in 1, N in 4, I in 3. L is missing.

We must include L.

Try O in position 1, L in position 4 – but L cannot be in 4.

O in position 2, L in position 5. Then _ O _ _ L.

Possible: C O N T L – but L in 5 is allowed.

“CONTL” – not a word.

“BONEL” – but E is ruled out.

“GONIL” – not a word.

“HONIL” – not a word.

“JONIL” – not a word.

“PONIL” – not a word.

“WONIL” – not a word.

“CHIOL” – not a word.

“PHIOL” – not a word.

“THIOL” – not a word.

“BIOLY” – not a word.

“KBIOL” – not a word.

Alternative: O in position 2, L in position 3. Then _ O L _ _.

Possible: C O L L A – but A is ruled out.

“COLLY” – but Y is possible, yet L is repeated and A is out.

“BOLLY” – same issue.

“POLLY” – same.

“FOLLY” – same.

Hmm, these are all invalid or not words.

Let’s try O in position 5, L in position 3. Then _ _ L _ O.

Possible: C L O C O – but C, L, O, yet C is possible, but O is already in 5.

“CLCOO” – not a word.

“FLCOO” – not a word.

“GLCOO” – not a word.

Not useful.

Alternative: O in position 1, L in position 5. Then O _ _ _ L.

Possible: O C H I L – but C, H, I are possible.

“OBILY” – not a word.

“ONILY” – not a word.

“OVILY” – not a word.

“OWILY” – not a word.

“OZILY” – not a word.

This is tricky. Let’s list all valid 5-letter words that contain both O and L, don’t use ruled-out letters (A, R, S, E, M, U, D), and place O and L in allowed positions.

Valid letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- “BLOKE” – but E is out.
- “BLOCK” – K is possible, but O is in 2, L in 3. This is valid.
  - B, L, O, C, K.
  - O is in 2 (allowed, since O only needs to be ≠3).
  - L is in 3 (allowed, since L only needs to be ≠4).

“BLOCK” seems to fit all criteria.

Let’s verify:
- Letters used: B, L, O, C, K.
- None of A, R, S, E, M, U, D are used.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- L is in position 3 (allowed).

Thus, “BLOCK” is a valid next guess.

Summary of everything we now know:

Letters ruled out: A, R, S, E, M, U, D, B, C, K  
Letters that are in the word: O and L  
- O cannot be in positions 2, 3 (from AROSE and BLOCK feedback).  
- O must therefore be in 1, 4, or 5.  
- L cannot be in positions 2, 4 (from MOULD and BLOCK feedback).  
- L must therefore be in 1, 3, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses both O and L exactly once each.  
- Only letters not yet ruled out: F, G, H, I, J, N, P, Q, T, V, W, Y, Z.  
- Places O and L in allowed positions.

Let’s list the remaining possible positions for each:
- O can be in 1, 4, 5.  
- L can be in 1, 3, 5.

We must place O and L in these positions and fill the other three slots with letters from the still-allowed set.

Possible patterns:
1. O in 1, L in 3 or 5  
   - O _ L _ _  → need two more letters (positions 2,4,5)  
   - O _ _ _ L  → need two more letters (positions 2,3,4)

2. O in 4 or 5, L in 1 or 3  
   - L _ _ O _  → need two more letters (positions 2,3,5)  
   - L _ _ _ _  with O in 4 or 5 and L in 1 or 3.

Let’s look for common words that fit.

Example 1: O _ L _ _  
Need two letters not yet used. Possible choices: F, G, H, I, N, P, T, V, W, Y.  
A valid word: O F L I N → “OF LIN” is not valid.  
“OLIVE” uses E (ruled out).  
“OLLYN” – not a word.  
“OLIVE” – E ruled out.  
No clear valid word here.

Example 2: O _ _ _ L  
Need three letters, but we only have two slots (positions 2,3,4) and need to pick two.  
Possible: O N I T L – “ONITL” not a word.  
“OPINE” – but P, I, N are allowed, yet E is ruled out.  
“ONION” – but N, I, O, N, yet N is allowed, but O is in 1, L must be in 5, but “ONION” has no L.  
Not useful.

Example 3: L _ _ O _  
Need two letters in positions 2,3 and one more in 5.  
Possible: L I N O T – “LINOT” not a word.  
“L I G O T” – not a word.  
“L I F O T” – not a word.  
“L I N O Y” – not a word.  
“L I G O N” – but N is allowed, O in 4, L in 1.  
“LIGON” – not a standard word.

Example 4: L _ _ _ O  
Need three letters in positions 2,3,4.

“LIN GO” is actually a valid word (colloquial, but accepted in many word lists).

However, “LIN GO” is often written as “LIN GO” with a space, but as a single 5-letter word it’s typically “LINGO” (also a word in some dictionaries).

“LINGO” is 5 letters: L I N G O.

<guess>LINGO</guess>",LINGO,"Summary of everything we now know:

Letters ruled out: A, R, S, E, M, U, D, B, C, K  
Letters that are in the word: O and L  
- O cannot be in positions 2, 3 (from AROSE and BLOCK feedback).  
- O must therefore be in 1, 4, or 5.  
- L cannot be in positions 2, 4 (from MOULD and BLOCK feedback).  
- L must therefore be in 1, 3, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses both O and L exactly once each.  
- Only letters not yet ruled out: F, G, H, I, J, N, P, Q, T, V, W, Y, Z.  
- Places O and L in allowed positions.

Let’s list the remaining possible positions for each:
- O can be in 1, 4, 5.  
- L can be in 1, 3, 5.

We must place O and L in these positions and fill the other three slots with letters from the still-allowed set.

Possible patterns:
1. O in 1, L in 3 or 5  
   - O _ L _ _  → need two more letters (positions 2,4,5)  
   - O _ _ _ L  → need two more letters (positions 2,3,4)

2. O in 4 or 5, L in 1 or 3  
   - L _ _ O _  → need two more letters (positions 2,3,5)  
   - L _ _ _ _  with O in 4 or 5 and L in 1 or 3.

Let’s look for common words that fit.

Example 1: O _ L _ _  
Need two letters not yet used. Possible choices: F, G, H, I, N, P, T, V, W, Y.  
A valid word: O F L I N → “OF LIN” is not valid.  
“OLIVE” uses E (ruled out).  
“OLLYN” – not a word.  
“OLIVE” – E ruled out.  
No clear valid word here.

Example 2: O _ _ _ L  
Need three letters, but we only have two slots (positions 2,3,4) and need to pick two.  
Possible: O N I T L – “ONITL” not a word.  
“OPINE” – but P, I, N are allowed, yet E is ruled out.  
“ONION” – but N, I, O, N, yet N is allowed, but O is in 1, L must be in 5, but “ONION” has no L.  
Not useful.

Example 3: L _ _ O _  
Need two letters in positions 2,3 and one more in 5.  
Possible: L I N O T – “LINOT” not a word.  
“L I G O T” – not a word.  
“L I F O T” – not a word.  
“L I N O Y” – not a word.  
“L I G O N” – but N is allowed, O in 4, L in 1.  
“LIGON” – not a standard word.

Example 4: L _ _ _ O  
Need three letters in positions 2,3,4.  
Possible: L I N G O – “LIN GO” but needs to be 5 letters.  
“L I N G O” is 5 letters: L I N G O.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage of high-frequency letters in both position and presence.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O, but not in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O (but not in position 3).
2. Doesn't use A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good candidates: 
- DOING (O in position 2)
- COUNT (O in position 3 - but this is invalid because O was in position 3 in AROSE and marked as wrong position)
- MOULD (O in position 2)
- COULD (O in position 2)

I'll choose ""MOULD"" as it uses M, O, U, L, D - all common letters not yet ruled out.

Summary of what we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, M, U, D.
2. Letters that ARE in the word, but not yet fixed: O and L.
   - O is not in position 3.
   - L is not in position 4.

So the secret word contains both O and L, and they must be placed in positions other than 3 (for O) and 4 (for L).

Letters still available: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses both O and L exactly once each.
- Doesn’t use any of the letters already ruled out.
- Places O and L in allowed positions (O ≠ 3, L ≠ 4).

Possible patterns:
- O can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- L can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

Let’s try to pick a word that places these letters in allowed spots and uses other common remaining letters. A good candidate is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all still possible.
- O is in position 1 (allowed).
- L is not used, but we can check if this helps narrow things further.

Wait, “POINT” doesn’t use L at all. That’s bad because we need to confirm L’s placement. Let’s try “CLOPS”:
- C, P, S are still possible, but S is already ruled out (from AROSE). So this is invalid.

Next candidate: “CLOAK” – but A and K are still possible, yet A is ruled out. Not good.

Try “CLOPS” again – S is ruled out. So scratch that.

Better candidate: “CLOPS” is out due to S.

Another candidate: “CLOBS” – B and S; S is out.

Try “CLOBS” is invalid.

Next: “CLOBS” no.

Try “CLOBS” is invalid.

Let’s try “CLOBS” is invalid.

Wait, let’s list valid letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, Y, Z.

We need both O and L. Let’s try to place O and L in allowed spots and fill the rest with other available letters.

One valid placement: O in position 2, L in position 3. Then the word would be _ O L _ _.

Possible letters for other positions: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, Y, Z.

Let’s try “BOLTS” – but S is out.

“COLTS” – S out.

“GOLTS” – S out.

“HOLTS” – S out.

“JOLTS” – S out.

“KOLTS” – S out.

“POLTS” – S out.

“TOLKS” – S out.

“VOLKS” – S out.

“WOLKS” – S out.

“YOLKS” – S out.

Hmm, S is a problem. Let’s avoid S.

Alternative placement: O in position 4, L in position 2. Then word would be _ L _ O _.

Possible: C L O C K – but O would be in 3, which is invalid.

C L O C K invalid.

Alternative: O in position 5, L in position 2. Then _ L _ _ O.

Possible: B L I N O – but I is possible, N is possible, B is possible.

“BLINO” – is this a valid word? Not really.

“CLINO” – not valid.

“FLINT” – but O is in 5, L in 2. F, L, I, N, T. That’s valid.

“FLINT”:
- F, L, I, N, T.
- L is in position 2 (allowed, since L only needs to be ≠4).
- O is not used here. We need to include O.

So FLINT is invalid.

Alternative: O in position 1, L in position 2. Then O L _ _ _.

Possible: O L D N T – but D and N, T are possible, yet D is ruled out.

“OLIVE” – but E is ruled out.

“ONION” – but N, I, O, N. O in 1, N in 4, I in 3. L is missing.

We must include L.

Try O in position 1, L in position 4 – but L cannot be in 4.

O in position 2, L in position 5. Then _ O _ _ L.

Possible: C O N T L – but L in 5 is allowed.

“CONTL” – not a word.

“BONEL” – but E is ruled out.

“GONIL” – not a word.

“HONIL” – not a word.

“JONIL” – not a word.

“PONIL” – not a word.

“TONIL” – not a word.

“WONIL” – not a word.

“YONIL” – not a word.

Alternative: O in position 4, L in position 5. Then _ _ _ O L.

Possible: C H I O L – but C, H, I are possible.

“CHIOL” – not a word.

“PHIOL” – not a word.

“THIOL” – not a word.

“BIOLY” – not a word.

“KBIOL” – not a word.

Alternative: O in position 2, L in position 3. Then _ O L _ _.

Possible: C O L L A – but A is ruled out.

“COLLY” – but Y is possible, yet L is repeated and A is out.

“BOLLY” – same issue.

“POLLY” – same.

“FOLLY” – same.

“GOLLY” – same.

“HOLLY” – same.

“JOLLY” – same.

“KOLLY” – same.

“PONLY” – not a word.

“TONLY” – not a word.

“WOLLY” – same.

“YOLLY” – same.

Hmm, these are all invalid or not words.

Let’s try O in position 5, L in position 3. Then _ _ L _ O.

Possible: C L O C O – but C, L, O, yet C is possible, but O is already in 5.

“CLCOO” – not a word.

“FLCOO” – not a word.

“GLCOO” – not a word.

Not useful.

Alternative: O in position 1, L in position 5. Then O _ _ _ L.

Possible: O C H I L – but C, H, I are possible.

“OCHIL” – not a word.

“OBILY” – not a word.

“ONILY” – not a word.

“OVILY” – not a word.

“OWILY” – not a word.

“OZILY” – not a word.

This is tricky. Let’s list all valid 5-letter words that contain both O and L, don’t use ruled-out letters (A, R, S, E, M, U, D), and place O and L in allowed positions.

Valid letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- “BLOKE” – but E is out.
- “BLOCK” – K is possible, but O is in 2, L in 3. This is valid.
  - B, L, O, C, K.
  - O is in 2 (allowed, since O only needs to be ≠3).
  - L is in 3 (allowed, since L only needs to be ≠4).

“BLOCK” seems to fit all criteria.

Let’s verify:
- Letters used: B, L, O, C, K.
- None of A, R, S, E, M, U, D are used.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- L is in position 3 (allowed).

Thus, “BLOCK” is a valid next guess.

From the latest feedback on LINGO:
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → L must appear exactly once and cannot be in position 1.
- I is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → I is in position 2.
- N and G are NOT in the word (x).

Updated constraints:
- Letters in the word: O, L, I (I locked in position 2).
- Letters ruled out: A, R, S, E, M, U, D, B, C, K, N, G.
- Allowed letters for other positions: F, H, J, P, Q, T, V, W, Y, plus the already-known O and L.

Positions so far:
- Position 2: I (fixed).
- We still need to place O and L in the remaining three positions (1, 3, 4, 5) while respecting:
  – O cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from earlier feedback).
  – L cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4 (from earlier feedback).
  – L must appear exactly once, so no second L.

Therefore:
- L can only be in position 3 or 5.
- O can be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2 or 3).
- We need one more distinct letter from F, H, J, P, Q, T, V, W, Y to fill the remaining slots.

Let’s enumerate the two possible placements of L:

Case 1: L in position 3  
Pattern: _ I L _ _  
We need O and one other allowed letter in positions 1, 4, 5.  
- O cannot be in position 3 (already) or 2, so it could be 1, 4, or 5.  
But position 3 is L, position 2 is I, so O must go in 1, 4, or 5.  
We also need one more letter from F, H, J, P, Q, T, V, W, Y.

Possible sub-patterns:
- O I L _ _ → need two more letters in 4,5.  
  Example: O I L F T → “OILFT” not a word.  
  “OIL HF” no.  
  “OIL JP” no.  
  Not promising.

- _ I L O _ → need letters in 1 and 5.  
  Example: F I L O T → “F I L O T” → “F I L O T” → “F I L O T” → “FILOT” not a word.  
  “H I L O T” → “H I L O T” → “H I L O T” → “HILOT” not a word.  
  “T I L O W” → “T I L O W” → “T I L O W” → “T I L O W” not a word.

- _ I L _ O → need letters in 1 and 4.  
  Example: F I L T O → “F I L T O” → “F I L T O” → “FILTO” not a word.  
  “T I L K O” – K ruled out.  
  “P I L C O” – C ruled out.  
  “V I L A O” – A ruled out.  
  Not working.

Case 2: L in position 5  
Pattern: _ I _ _ L  
We need O and one other allowed letter in positions 1, 3, 4.  
- O cannot be in position 2 or 3, so it must be 1 or 4.  
- We also need one more letter from F, H, J, P, Q, T, V, W, Y.

Sub-patterns:
- O I _ _ L → need two letters in 3,4 from allowed set.  
  Example: O I T F L → “OITFL” not a word.  
  “O I P H L” → “OIPH L” not a word.  
  “O I V E L” – E ruled out.  
  Not working.

- _ I _ O L → need letters in 1 and 3.  
  Example: T I N O L – N ruled out.  
  “T I P O L” → “T I P O L” → “T I P O L” → “T I P O L” → “T I P O L” not a word.  
  “H I P O L” → “H I P O L” → “H I P O L” → “H I P O L” not a word.  
  “V I P O L” not a word.  
  “F I P O L” not a word.

- _ I O _ L → need letters in 1 and 4.  
  Example: T I O W L – “T I O W L” not a word.  
  “P I O T L” → “P I O T L” → “P I O T L” not a word.  
  “V I O T L” not a word.  
  “F I O T L” not a word.  
  “H I O T L” not a word.

Hmm, none of these obvious combinations seem to form valid English words.  
Let’s try a different approach: look for real 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ I _ _ L with O somewhere and letters from the allowed set.

Possible candidates:
- “FIROL” – but R is ruled out.  
- “HILOT” – but O must be in the word.  
- “PILOT” – but O is in 4, L in 5, I in 2.  
  Check letters: P, I, L, O, T.  
  - P, I, L, O, T — none are ruled out.  
  - Positions: P (1), I (2), L (3), O (4), T (5).  
  - L is in 3, which is allowed (earlier L constraints only forbade 1, 2, 4).  
  - O is in 4, which is allowed (earlier O constraints only forbade 2, 3).  
  - I is in 2, which matches the confirmed position.  
  - All letters are allowed.  
  - “PILOT” is a valid English word.

Let’s choose “PILOT” as the next guess.
