### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-1 consonants, or vice versa, to test multiple letters efficiently.

Looking at the common letters, ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us 4 vowels and 1 consonant, which should provide good coverage for the first guess.

All five letters in RAISE (R, A, I, S, E) are NOT in the secret word (each received an “x”).  
Therefore I must pick a 5-letter word that uses none of those five letters.

Letters still available include: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I want a word that:
- uses common remaining consonants and vowels,  
- avoids the five already-eliminated letters,  
- gives me information about new letters.

A good mid-game word that covers several still-possible common letters is “COUNT”.  
It contains C, O, U, N, T — none of which appeared in RAISE — and it tests a vowel (O, U) and three common consonants (C, N, T).

(Another viable option would be “MOUNT”, but I’ll go with COUNT here.)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-1 consonants, or vice versa, to test multiple letters efficiently.

Looking at the common letters, ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us 4 vowels and 1 consonant, which should provide good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in RAISE (R, A, I, S, E) are NOT in the secret word (each received an “x”).  
Therefore I must pick a 5-letter word that uses none of those five letters.

Letters still available include: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I want a word that:
- uses common remaining consonants and vowels,  
- avoids the five already-eliminated letters,  
- gives me information about new letters.

A good mid-game word that covers several still-possible common letters is “COUNT”.  
It contains C, O, U, N, T — none of which appeared in RAISE — and it tests a vowel (O, U) and three common consonants (C, N, T).

(Another viable option would be “MOUNT”, but I’ll go with COUNT here.)

We now know that none of the letters R, A, I, S, E, C, O, N, T are in the word at all (they all got “x”), and the only letter we know is in the word but not in its position is U (it got “-” in COUNT).  
So the secret word must contain U somewhere, but not in the 3rd position (since U was in position 3 in COUNT and got “-”).  
All other letters are still possible except those already ruled out.

Remaining common letters include: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
I want a word that:
- definitely contains U,  
- places U in a different position than 3,  
- uses only still-allowed letters,  
- gives me information about new consonants/vowels.

A good candidate is “PLUMB”:
- P, L, M, B are all still possible.  
- U is in position 2, which is different from the “-” in COUNT (where U was in position 3).  
- It tests four new letters (P, L, M, B) and the known-possible U.

Another candidate could be “GULCH”, but PLUMB seems slightly more balanced.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, I, S, E, C, O, N, T, P, L, B, D  
- Letters confirmed IN the word and in the correct positions:  
  – U in position 2  
  – M in position 4  
  – M in position 5 (but we already have M in position 4, so this implies the word has two M’s: one at position 4 and one at position 5)

So the secret word looks like: _ U _ M M  
and the only unknown is the first letter.

Still-allowed letters (not yet ruled out): F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

I want a 5-letter word that:
1. Has U in position 2.  
2. Has M in position 4 and 5 (double M).  
3. Has a valid first letter from the remaining set.

The only common English words that fit this pattern are:
- FU MMM  – invalid (no such word)
- GU MMM  – invalid
- HU MMM  – invalid
- JU MMM  – invalid
- KU MMM  – invalid
- VU MMM  – invalid
- WU MMM  – invalid
- XU MMM  – invalid
- YU MMM  – invalid
- ZU MMM  – invalid

Wait, let me reconsider – there are no standard English words with the pattern _ U _ M M.  
This suggests I may have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Looking back at Guess 4: DUMMY -> D(x) U(✓) M(✓) M(✓) Y(✓)

The feedback symbols are applied to each letter in order:
- D(x) – not in word
- U(✓) – in word and correct position (position 2)
- M(✓) – in word and correct position (position 3)
- M(✓) – in word and correct position (position 4)
- Y(✓) – in word and correct position (position 5)

So the word structure is: _ U M M Y

Ah! The word has:
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: M
- Position 4: M
- Position 5: Y

And position 1 is still unknown.

Now the remaining letters for position 1 are: F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z (since D, P, L, B, C, O, N, T, R, A, I, S, E are all out).

Common English words ending in “UMMY” are:

- GUMMY – not standard
- HUMMY – not standard
- JUMMY – not standard
- KUMMY – not standard
- VUMMY – not standard
- WUMMY – not standard
- XUMMY – not standard
- ZUMMY – not standard

The only real word that fits is “HUMMY” but that’s not recognized.  
Rechecking standard dictionaries, the valid 5-letter word ending in “UMMY” is actually none in common English.  
This implies I may have miscounted positions.

Wait, let’s re-index the positions clearly:

Guess 4: D U M M Y
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5

So:
- Position 2 must be U
- Position 3 must be M
- Position 4 must be M
- Position 5 must be Y
- Position 1 is unknown

The word must be: ? U M M Y

Looking up valid English words: “BUMPY” is invalid, “GUMMY” is invalid, “HUMMY” is invalid, etc.  
The only valid word in standard English that matches this pattern is “MUMMY”.

Check letters:
- M – allowed (not yet ruled out)
- U – allowed and must be in position 2
- M – allowed and must be in position 3
- M – allowed and must be in position 4
- Y – allowed and must be in position 5

All letters are allowed and positions match.
