### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities quickly. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

I'll choose a word that combines several of these. ""SLATE"" is a popular starting choice because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering several common letters and multiple vowels. This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are **not present** in the secret word.  
That means I can safely ignore every one of those letters when choosing the next guess.  
I need a word that uses entirely different letters, preferably still common ones so I can gather maximum information.  
Good letters left: R, O, N, I, C, U, M, D, H, G, B, K, F, Y, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.

A balanced choice would be a word with a mix of vowels and consonants, avoiding any of S, L, A, T, E.  
“ROUND” uses R, O, U, N, D — all fresh letters and reasonably common.

Another candidate could be “CHURN” or “BRICK”, but “ROUND” feels like a solid, information-dense first choice.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N
- Letters KNOWN to be in the word: O (in the correct position 2), D (in the word but not in position 5)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 2nd position.
2. Contains D somewhere other than the 5th position.
3. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (no S,L,A,T,E,R,U,N).

Available letters (common ones left): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the already-known O and D.

Since O is fixed in position 2, the word looks like: _ O _ _ _

We also know D must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Let’s try to pick a word that satisfies these constraints and also introduces new common letters to maximize information. A good candidate is “CODGE”:
- C, O, D, G, E — but E is already ruled out.
Next candidate: “MOLDY” — M, O, L, D, Y — but L is ruled out.
Next: “PODGY” — P, O, D, G, Y — all letters are still possible.

Another good candidate is “BOWDY” — B, O, W, D, Y.

From the feedback so far:

Letters known NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, B, W

Letters known to be in the word and their positions:
- O must be in position 2 (✓ every time)
- D must be in position 4 (✓ this time)
- Y must be in position 5 (✓ this time)

So the pattern is: _ O _ D Y

We still need letters for positions 1 and 3, using only the remaining common letters:  
C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, F, Z, Q, J (but we’ll stick to the most common).

Good candidates for position 1 and 3 that fit _ O _ D Y:
- C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V

Let’s try to pick a word that fits this pattern and uses new common letters.  
Some possibilities:
- CODDY (but D is already in position 4, and CODDY is not a common word)
- FODDY (not common)
- GODDY (not common)
- HODDY (not common)
- MODDY (not common)
- PODDY (not common)
- VODDY (not common)

Actually, let’s think of standard 5-letter words with pattern _ O _ D Y:
- COULD (but U is ruled out)
- FOUND (but N is ruled out)
- GODLY (but G is possible, L is ruled out)
- HOSTY (but S, T are ruled out)
- MODAL (but A is ruled out)
- PODGY (but G is possible, Y is in position 5, but we need D in position 4)
- VOGUE (but U, G are possible, but V is possible)

Wait, the pattern is _ O _ D Y, so we need:
- First letter: any unused common consonant (C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V)
- Third letter: any unused common consonant (C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V)

Let’s list possible words:

- H O D D Y (HODDY – exists)
- M O D D Y (MODDY – exists)
- P O D D Y (PODDY – exists)
- V O D D Y (VODDY – exists)

These are all valid words, but let’s pick the most common one that introduces new letters.  
“FODDY” is a good choice as it’s common and introduces F, D, O, D, Y (but D is already known).

Actually, let’s pick “CODDY” to introduce C and D (D is already known but it’s okay since we need to test C).

But wait, we already know D is in position 4, so we don’t need to test D again.  
Let’s pick a word that uses new letters for position 1 and 3.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities quickly. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

I'll choose a word that combines several of these. ""SLATE"" is a popular starting choice because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering several common letters and multiple vowels. This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are **not present** in the secret word.  
That means I can safely ignore every one of those letters when choosing the next guess.  
I need a word that uses entirely different letters, preferably still common ones so I can gather maximum information.  
Good letters left: R, O, N, I, C, U, M, D, H, G, B, K, F, Y, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.

A balanced choice would be a word with a mix of vowels and consonants, avoiding any of S, L, A, T, E.  
“ROUND” uses R, O, U, N, D — all fresh letters and reasonably common.

Another candidate could be “CHURN” or “BRICK”, but “ROUND” feels like a solid, information-dense first choice.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N
- Letters KNOWN to be in the word: O (in the correct position 2), D (in the word but not in position 5)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 2nd position.
2. Contains D somewhere other than the 5th position.
3. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (no S,L,A,T,E,R,U,N).

Available letters (common ones left): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the already-known O and D.

Since O is fixed in position 2, the word looks like: _ O _ _ _

We also know D must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Let’s try to pick a word that satisfies these constraints and also introduces new common letters to maximize information. A good candidate is “CODGE”:
- C, O, D, G, E — but E is already ruled out.
Next candidate: “MOLDY” — M, O, L, D, Y — but L is ruled out.
Next: “PODGY” — P, O, D, G, Y — all letters are still possible.

Another good candidate is “BOWDY” — B, O, W, D, Y.

Between these, “BOWDY” introduces B, W, and Y, which are all new and common.

Let’s go with “BOWDY”.

Step 1 – Extract what is known  
- Letters definitely absent: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, B, W, G  
- Letters definitely present and fixed:  
  – O in position 2  
  – Y in position 5  
- Letters definitely present but not yet fixed: D (must be in the word, but we still need to determine its exact position).

Step 2 – Determine the current pattern  
Because O is locked in position 2 and Y is locked in position 5, the word looks like:  
_ O _ _ Y  

Step 3 – Incorporate the latest feedback (GODDY)  
GODDY → G(x) O(✓) D(-) D(✓) Y(✓)  
- G is not in the word (x)  
- O is correct in position 2 (✓)  
- First D is not in position 3 (-)  
- Second D is correct in position 4 (✓)  

So we now know:  
D must be in position 4, and it cannot be in position 3.  
Thus the pattern is: _ O _ D Y  

Step 4 – Identify remaining possible letters  
All unused letters from the alphabet, excluding the eliminated ones:  
C, F, H, I, K, M, P, V, Z, Q, J, etc.  
We need a valid 5-letter word that fits _ O _ D Y and uses only these letters.

Step 5 – Search for real words matching _ O _ D D Y  
Real English 5-letter words that fit _ O _ D Y:  
- CODDY – uses C, O, D, D, Y (C is still possible)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities quickly. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

I'll choose a word that combines several of these. ""SLATE"" is a popular starting choice because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering several common letters and multiple vowels. This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are **not present** in the secret word.  
That means I can safely ignore every one of those letters when choosing the next guess.  
I need a word that uses entirely different letters, preferably still common ones so I can gather maximum information.  
Good letters left: R, O, N, I, C, U, M, D, H, G, B, K, F, Y, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.

A balanced choice would be a word with a mix of vowels and consonants, avoiding any of S, L, A, T, E.  
“ROUND” uses R, O, U, N, D — all fresh letters and reasonably common.

Another candidate could be “CHURN” or “BRICK”, but “ROUND” feels like a solid, information-dense first choice.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N
- Letters KNOWN to be in the word: O (in the correct position 2), D (in the word but not in position 5)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 2nd position.
2. Contains D somewhere other than the 5th position.
3. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (no S,L,A,T,E,R,U,N).

Available letters (common ones left): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the already-known O and D.

Since O is fixed in position 2, the word looks like: _ O _ _ _

We also know D must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Let’s try to pick a word that satisfies these constraints and also introduces new common letters to maximize information. A good candidate is “CODGE”:
- C, O, D, G, E — but E is already ruled out.
Next candidate: “MOLDY” — M, O, L, D, Y — but L is ruled out.
Next: “PODGY” — P, O, D, G, Y — all letters are still possible.

Another good candidate is “BOWDY” — B, O, W, D, Y.

Between these, “BOWDY” introduces B, W, and Y, which are all new and common.

Let’s go with “BOWDY”.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

Letters known NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, B, W

Letters known to be in the word and their positions:
- O must be in position 2 (✓ every time)
- D must be in position 4 (✓ this time)
- Y must be in position 5 (✓ this time)

So the pattern is: _ O _ D Y

We still need letters for positions 1 and 3, using only the remaining common letters:  
C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, F, Z, Q, J (but we’ll stick to the most common).

Good candidates for position 1 and 3 that fit _ O _ D Y:
- C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V

Let’s try to pick a word that fits this pattern and uses new common letters.  
Some possibilities:
- CODDY (but D is already in position 4, and CODDY is not a common word)
- FODDY (not common)
- GODDY (not common)
- HODDY (not common)
- MODDY (not common)
- PODDY (not common)
- VODDY (not common)

Actually, let’s think of standard 5-letter words with pattern _ O _ D Y:
- COULD (but U is ruled out)
- FOUND (but N is ruled out)
- GODLY (but G is possible, L is ruled out)
- HOSTY (but S, T are ruled out)
- MODAL (but A is ruled out)
- PODGY (but G is possible, Y is in position 5, but we need D in position 4)
- VOGUE (but U, G are possible, but V is possible)

Wait, the pattern is _ O _ D Y, so we need:
- First letter: any unused common consonant (C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V)
- Third letter: any unused common consonant (C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V)

Let’s list possible words:
- C O V D Y (COVDY – not a word)
- F O G D Y (FOG DY – not a word)
- G O K D Y (GOKDY – not a word)
- H O K D Y (HOKDY – not a word)
- M O V D Y (MOV DY – not a word)
- P O K D Y (POKDY – not a word)
- V O G D Y (VOG DY – not a word)

Hmm, let’s think of real words with _ O _ D Y:
- C O D D Y (CODDY – exists as a slang term for “coddie”, but D is already in position 4)
- F O D D Y (FODDY – exists)
- G O D D Y (GODDY – exists)
- H O D D Y (HODDY – exists)
- M O D D Y (MODDY – exists)
- P O D D Y (PODDY – exists)
- V O D D Y (VODDY – exists)

These are all valid words, but let’s pick the most common one that introduces new letters.  
“FODDY” is a good choice as it’s common and introduces F, D, O, D, Y (but D is already known).

Actually, let’s pick “CODDY” to introduce C and D (D is already known but it’s okay since we need to test C).

But wait, we already know D is in position 4, so we don’t need to test D again.  
Let’s pick a word that uses new letters for position 1 and 3.

Looking at the pattern _ O _ D Y, and available letters (C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V), let’s try:

- C O V D Y (COVDY – not a word)
- F O K D Y (FOKDY – not a word)
- G O M D Y (GOMDY – not a word)
- H I V D Y (HIV DY – not a word)
- M O V D Y (MOV DY – not a word)
- P O K D Y (POKDY – not a word)
- V I V D Y (VIV DY – not a word)

Real words with _ O _ D Y:
- C O D D Y (CODDY – exists)
- F O D D Y (FODDY – exists)
- G O D D Y (GODDY – exists)
- H O D D Y (HODDY – exists)
- M O D D Y (MODDY – exists)
- P O D D Y (PODDY – exists)
- V O D D Y (VODDY – exists)

Among these, “GODDY” is a valid word and uses G, O, D, D, Y. It introduces G, which is new.

Let’s go with “GODDY”.

Step 1 – Collect all knowledge  
- Letters already ruled OUT: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, B, W, G, C  
- Letters that MUST be in the word (because they were marked “-” or “✓” at least once):  
  – O (always ✓ in position 2)  
  – D (always ✓ in position 4)  
  – Y (always ✓ in position 5)  

Step 2 – Fix the known positions  
The secret word has the pattern:  
[?] O [?] D Y  

Step 3 – Determine what’s still allowed for the blanks  
Allowed letters are any consonants/vowels not yet eliminated.  
Remaining candidates for positions 1 and 3 (from the alphabet minus the eliminated set):  
F, H, I, K, M, P, V, Z, Q, J, etc.  

Step 4 – Find real 5-letter words matching _ O _ D Y  
Real words that fit:  
- F O _ D Y  → FODY?  (F O D Y – but we need 5 letters)  
- H O _ D Y  → HODY?  (H O D Y – again 4 letters)  
- M O _ D Y  → MODY?  (M O D Y – 4 letters)  
- P O _ D Y  → PODY?  (P O D Y – 4 letters)  
- V O _ D Y  → VODY?  (V O D Y – 4 letters)  

Wait, let’s list actual 5-letter English words with pattern _ O _ D Y:  
- F O D D Y  
- H O D D Y  
- M O D D Y  
- P O D D Y  
- V O D D Y  

All these use letters not yet eliminated.  
Among them, “HODDY” is the most common and natural word.

Step 5 – Make the final choice  
“HODDY” is the best remaining candidate.
