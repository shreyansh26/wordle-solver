### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should have several of these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This will give us maximum feedback about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- O(x) → O is NOT in the word  
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word

- keeps A, R, E in different positions than before (A not 1st, R not 2nd, E not 5th)  
- introduces new common letters (T, N, I, L, C, etc.)  
- avoids O and S entirely  

A good candidate is “REACT”:  
- R moves from position 2 to 1 (allowed, since feedback only said R is not in position 2)  
- E moves from position 5 to 2 (allowed, since feedback only said E is not in position 5)  
- A moves from position 1 to 3 (allowed, since feedback only said A is not in position 1)  
- Adds C and T, two very common letters not yet tested  

This should quickly narrow down remaining possibilities.

Oops, E cannot be last. Let’s try “EARLY”:

- Positions:  
  – E in 1 (new)  
  – A in 2 (new)

This looks valid.

Another candidate is “LARGE”:

  – A in 2 (new)  
  – R in 3 (new)  
  – G (new)  
  – E in 5 (invalid, E cannot be last).

“MARES” is invalid (contains S).  
“GRAPE” contains P (not yet tested) but E is last (invalid).  
“HEART” contains T (invalid).  
“ANGER” has E in 4 (valid), A in 2 (valid), R in 5 (valid). Adds N, G.

Let’s go with “ANGER”.

Check constraints:
- A in 2 (valid), R in 5 (valid), E in 4 (valid)  
- Does not contain O, S, C, T  
- Contains new letters N, G  

This is a solid third guess.

From the feedback so far:

Letters we know are in the word: A, R, E

Positions:
- E is in position 4 (✓)  
- R is in position 5 (✓)  
- A is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from arose and react and anger) → A must be in position 4, but position 4 is already E → contradiction. Wait, let’s re-read carefully.

Wait, the feedback for guess 3 (anger) is:
A(-) N(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)

This means:
- A is in the word but not in position 1 (from arose), not in position 3 (from react), and not in position 1 (from anger) → A must be in position 2 or 4 or 5.  
- E is in position 4 (✓)  
- R is in position 5 (✓)  

So positions 4 and 5 are fixed as E and R.

Thus the word looks like: _ _ _ E R

We know A must be somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (since 1 and 4,5 are ruled out).

Also, we have not used yet: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word that:
1. Contains A in position 2 or 3.  
2. Does not contain O, S, C, T, N, G.

4. Uses new common letters.

Valid 5-letter words found: W A V E R → W A V E R (but position 3 is V, position 2 is A, position 4 is E, position 5 is R → W A V E R = “waver”).

Check constraints:
- Contains A (position 2), E (position 4), R (position 5)  
- Does not contain O, S, C, T, N, G  
- New letters introduced: W, V  

Thus, the next guess is W A V E R.

But let me double-check:
- W A V E R: letters W, A, V, E, R  
- O, S, C, T, N, G are all absent  
- Positions:  
  – A in 2 (allowed)  
  – E in 4 (matches ✓)

  – W and V are new letters.

This seems correct.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should have several of these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This will give us maximum feedback about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2  
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word  
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word  
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5  

Letters we know are in the secret word: A, R, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, S  

To maximize information, I’ll pick a word that:
- keeps A, R, E in different positions than before (A not 1st, R not 2nd, E not 5th)  
- introduces new common letters (T, N, I, L, C, etc.)  
- avoids O and S entirely  

A good candidate is “REACT”:  
- R moves from position 2 to 1 (allowed, since feedback only said R is not in position 2)  
- E moves from position 5 to 2 (allowed, since feedback only said E is not in position 5)  
- A moves from position 1 to 3 (allowed, since feedback only said A is not in position 1)  
- Adds C and T, two very common letters not yet tested  

This should quickly narrow down remaining possibilities.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
Guess 2: react → R(-) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)

What we now know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, E  
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S, C, T  
- Positions still unknown for A, R, E (they each appear in only one of the two guesses so far, so we still have no positional info)

We need a word that:
1. Contains A, R, E (all three must be present).  
2. Does NOT contain O, S, C, T.  
3. Places A, R, E in positions they have not occupied yet.  
   - A: not in position 1 (from arose) or 3 (from react) → must be 2, 4, or 5  
   - R: not in position 2 (from arose) or 1 (from react) → must be 3, 4, or 5  
   - E: not in position 5 (from arose) or 2 (from react) → must be 1, 3, or 4  

We also want to introduce new common letters not yet tested (e.g., N, I, L, D, G, M, etc.).

A word that satisfies all these constraints is “RAISE”:
- Contains R, A, E (all required).  
- Excludes O, S, C, T.  
- Positions:  
  – R in position 1 (new position, not ruled out)  
  – A in position 2 (new position, not ruled out)  
  – E in position 5 (but E cannot be in position 5 from arose → this violates the constraint).

Oops, E cannot be last. Let’s try “EARLY”:
- Contains E, A, R (required).  
- Excludes O, S, C, T.  
- Positions:  
  – E in 1 (new)  
  – A in 2 (new)  
  – R in 3 (new)  
- Adds L and Y (new letters).

This looks valid.

Another candidate is “LARGE”:
- Contains A, R, E.  
- Excludes O, S, C, T.  
- Positions:  
  – L (new)  
  – A in 2 (new)  
  – R in 3 (new)  
  – G (new)  
  – E in 5 (invalid, E cannot be last).

“MARES” is invalid (contains S).  
“GRAPE” contains P (not yet tested) but E is last (invalid).  
“HEART” contains T (invalid).  
“ANGER” has E in 4 (valid), A in 2 (valid), R in 5 (valid). Adds N, G.

Let’s go with “ANGER”.

Check constraints:
- A in 2 (valid), R in 5 (valid), E in 4 (valid)  
- Does not contain O, S, C, T  
- Contains new letters N, G

- E is in position 4 (✓)  
- R is in position 5 (✓)  

So positions 4 and 5 are fixed as E and R.

Thus the word looks like: _ _ _ E R

We know A must be somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (since 1 and 4,5 are ruled out).

Valid 5-letter words found: W A V E R → W A V E R (but position 3 is V, position 2 is A, position 4 is E, position 5 is R → W A V E R = “waver”).

Check constraints:
- Contains A (position 2), E (position 4), R (position 5)  
- Does not contain O, S, C, T, N, G  
- New letters introduced: W, V  

Thus, the next guess is W A V E R.

But let me double-check:
- W A V E R: letters W, A, V, E, R  
- O, S, C, T, N, G are all absent  
- Positions:  
  – A in 2 (allowed)  
  – E in 4 (matches ✓)  
  – R in 5 (matches ✓)  
  – W and V are new letters.

This seems correct.

From the feedback so far:

Letters we know are in the word: A, R, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, S, C, T, N, G, W, V  

Positions:
- A is now in position 2 (✓)  
- E is in position 4 (✓)  
- R is in position 5 (✓)  

So the pattern is: _ A _ E R

We still need to determine positions 1 and 3.  
Allowed letters for these positions: any letter not in the forbidden set {O, S, C, T, N, G, W, V}.  
That leaves: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, X, Y, Z.

Valid words found:

Let me check constraints for each:

HALER:
- Letters: H, A, L, E, R  
- Forbidden letters: O, S, C, T, N, G, W, V — none present  
- Positions: A in 2 (✓), E in 4 (✓), R in 5 (✓)  
- New letters: H, L  

PALER:
- Letters: P, A, L, E, R  
- Same check: no forbidden letters, correct positions, new letters P, L  

TALER:
- Letters: T, A, L, E, R  
- T is forbidden (from earlier feedback T(x)) — so TALER is invalid.

Thus, valid candidates: HALER, PALER.

Between these, both fit, but let me choose HALER first.

</think>

The pattern _ A _ E R is locked in, with A, E, R confirmed in positions 2, 4, 5 respectively. Forbidden letters so far include O, S, C, T, N, G, W, V. The only remaining valid 5-letter word that fits is:

Valid words found:

- P A L E R → PALER  
- T A L E R → TALER  

Let me check constraints for each:

HALER:
- Letters: H, A, L, E, R  
- Forbidden letters: O, S, C, T, N, G, W, V — none present  
- Positions: A in 2 (✓), E in 4 (✓), R in 5 (✓)  
- New letters: H, L  

PALER:
- Letters: P, A, L, E, R  
- Same check: no forbidden letters, correct positions, new letters P, L  

TALER:
- Letters: T, A, L, E, R  
- T is forbidden (from earlier feedback T(x)) — so TALER is invalid.

Thus, valid candidates: HALER, PALER.

Between these, both fit, but let me choose HALER first.The pattern _ A _ E R is locked in, with A, E, R confirmed in positions 2, 4, 5 respectively. Forbidden letters so far include O, S, C, T, N, G, W, V. The only remaining valid 5-letter word that fits is:",Guess 5: haler -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) L(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should have several of these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This will give us maximum feedback about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2  
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word  
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word  
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5  

Letters we know are in the secret word: A, R, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, S  

To maximize information, I’ll pick a word that:
- keeps A, R, E in different positions than before (A not 1st, R not 2nd, E not 5th)  
- introduces new common letters (T, N, I, L, C, etc.)  
- avoids O and S entirely  

A good candidate is “REACT”:  
- R moves from position 2 to 1 (allowed, since feedback only said R is not in position 2)  
- E moves from position 5 to 2 (allowed, since feedback only said E is not in position 5)  
- A moves from position 1 to 3 (allowed, since feedback only said A is not in position 1)  
- Adds C and T, two very common letters not yet tested  

This should quickly narrow down remaining possibilities.

Guess 2: react -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
Guess 2: react → R(-) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)

What we now know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, E  
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S, C, T  
- Positions still unknown for A, R, E (they each appear in only one of the two guesses so far, so we still have no positional info)

We need a word that:
1. Contains A, R, E (all three must be present).  
2. Does NOT contain O, S, C, T.  
3. Places A, R, E in positions they have not occupied yet.  
   - A: not in position 1 (from arose) or 3 (from react) → must be 2, 4, or 5  
   - R: not in position 2 (from arose) or 1 (from react) → must be 3, 4, or 5  
   - E: not in position 5 (from arose) or 2 (from react) → must be 1, 3, or 4  

We also want to introduce new common letters not yet tested (e.g., N, I, L, D, G, M, etc.).

A word that satisfies all these constraints is “RAISE”:
- Contains R, A, E (all required).  
- Excludes O, S, C, T.  
- Positions:  
  – R in position 1 (new position, not ruled out)  
  – A in position 2 (new position, not ruled out)  
  – E in position 5 (but E cannot be in position 5 from arose → this violates the constraint).

Oops, E cannot be last. Let’s try “EARLY”:
- Contains E, A, R (required).  
- Excludes O, S, C, T.  
- Positions:  
  – E in 1 (new)  
  – A in 2 (new)  
  – R in 3 (new)  
- Adds L and Y (new letters).

This looks valid.

Another candidate is “LARGE”:
- Contains A, R, E.  
- Excludes O, S, C, T.  
- Positions:  
  – L (new)  
  – A in 2 (new)  
  – R in 3 (new)  
  – G (new)  
  – E in 5 (invalid, E cannot be last).

“MARES” is invalid (contains S).  
“GRAPE” contains P (not yet tested) but E is last (invalid).  
“HEART” contains T (invalid).  
“ANGER” has E in 4 (valid), A in 2 (valid), R in 5 (valid). Adds N, G.

Let’s go with “ANGER”.

Check constraints:
- A in 2 (valid), R in 5 (valid), E in 4 (valid)  
- Does not contain O, S, C, T  
- Contains new letters N, G  

This is a solid third guess.

Guess 3: anger -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

Letters we know are in the word: A, R, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, S, C, T, N, G  

Positions:
- E is in position 4 (✓)  
- R is in position 5 (✓)  
- A is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from arose and react and anger) → A must be in position 4, but position 4 is already E → contradiction. Wait, let’s re-read carefully.

Wait, the feedback for guess 3 (anger) is:
A(-) N(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)

This means:
- A is in the word but not in position 1 (from arose), not in position 3 (from react), and not in position 1 (from anger) → A must be in position 2 or 4 or 5.  
- E is in position 4 (✓)  
- R is in position 5 (✓)  

So positions 4 and 5 are fixed as E and R.

Thus the word looks like: _ _ _ E R

We know A must be somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (since 1 and 4,5 are ruled out).

Also, we have not used yet: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word that:
1. Contains A in position 2 or 3.  
2. Does not contain O, S, C, T, N, G.  
3. Has E in position 4 and R in position 5.  
4. Uses new common letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ A _ E R  
- _ _ A E R  

Let’s try _ A _ E R: possible letters for positions 1 and 3 (not O, S, C, T, N, G, and forming a word).

Position 1: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Position 3: same set, but must form a valid word.

Possible candidates:
- B A D E R → BADER (not a common word)  
- D A I E R → DAIER (not a word)  
- F A R E R → FARE R (but R is already in position 5, and we can’t have two R’s)  
- H A R E R → HARER (not a word)  
- L A R E R → LARER (not a word)  
- M A R E R → MARER (not a word)  
- P A R E R → PARER (not a word)  
- V A R E R → VARE R (not a word)  
- B A L E R → BALER (valid word: baler, though uncommon)  
- D A L E R → DALER (not a word)  
- F A L E R → FALER (not a word)  
- H A L E R → HALER (valid word: hal er, but usually “haler” is not 5-letter)  
- K A L E R → KALER (not a word)  
- M A L E R → MALER (not a word)  
- P A L E R → PALER (valid comparative form)  
- V A L E R → VALER (not a word)  
- B A V E R → BAVER (not a word)  
- D A V E R → DAVER (not a word)  
- F A V E R → FAVER (not a word)  
- H A V E R → HAVER (not a word)  
- J A V E R → JAVER (not a word)  
- K A V E R → KAVER (not a word)  
- L A V E R → LAVER (not a word)  
- M A V E R → MAVER (not a word)  
- P A V E R → PAVER (not a word)  
- Q A V E R → QAVER (not a word)  
- U A V E R → UAVER (not a word)  
- V A V E R → VAVER (not a word)  
- W A V E R → WAVER (valid word)  
- X A V E R → XAVER (not a word)  
- Y A V E R → YAVER (not a word)  
- Z A V E R → ZAVER (not a word)

Valid 5-letter words found: W A V E R → W A V E R (but position 3 is V, position 2 is A, position 4 is E, position 5 is R → W A V E R = “waver”).

Check constraints:
- Contains A (position 2), E (position 4), R (position 5)  
- Does not contain O, S, C, T, N, G  
- New letters introduced: W, V  

Thus, the next guess is W A V E R.

But let me double-check:
- W A V E R: letters W, A, V, E, R  
- O, S, C, T, N, G are all absent  
- Positions:  
  – A in 2 (allowed)  
  – E in 4 (matches ✓)  
  – R in 5 (matches ✓)  
  – W and V are new letters.

This seems correct.

From the feedback so far:

Letters we know are in the word: A, R, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, S, C, T, N, G, W, V  

Positions:
- A is now in position 2 (✓)  
- E is in position 4 (✓)  
- R is in position 5 (✓)  

So the pattern is: _ A _ E R

We still need to determine positions 1 and 3.  
Allowed letters for these positions: any letter not in the forbidden set {O, S, C, T, N, G, W, V}.  
That leaves: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, X, Y, Z.

B, D, F, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits the pattern B/A/D/F/I/J/K/M/P/Q/U/X/Y/Z + A + B/A/D/F/I/J/K/M/P/Q/U/X/Y/Z + E + R.

BALER is indeed a valid 5-letter word meaning a machine for baling hay or straw, and it uses only allowed letters and correct positions.
