For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first word uses as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One such word is ""RAISE"" - it contains R, A, I, S, E, which are all very common letters. This will give us good coverage to determine which letters might be in the secret word and their positions.

Summary of what we know so far:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: R, A, I, B, O, M.
2. Letters that ARE in the word: S and E (both currently in wrong positions).
   - S must NOT be in position 4 or 3 (from RAISE and BESOM feedback).
   - E must NOT be in position 5 or 2 (from RAISE and BESOM feedback).
3. Remaining unused common letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both S and E.
- Does not contain any of R, A, I, B, O, M.
- Places S in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 4 is already excluded by RAISE feedback), so possible positions for S: 1, 2, 5.
- Places E in positions 1, 3, 4 (but 5 is excluded by RAISE, and 2 is excluded by BESOM), so possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4.

Let’s look for words fitting these constraints:
- S in 1, 2, or 5; E in 1, 3, or 4.
- No forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- STONE: contains S (1), E (5) – but E cannot be in 5.
- SENTO: contains S (1), E (2) – but E cannot be in 2.
- FESTS: contains S (2), E (3) – valid positions.
- JESTS: contains S (2), E (3) – valid positions.
- HESTS: contains S (2), E (3) – valid positions.
- TESTS: contains S (2), E (3) – valid positions.

""FESTS"" is a valid word (plural of ""fest"") and meets all constraints:
- Contains S (2) and E (3).
- Does not contain any forbidden letters.
- Positions: S not 3 or 4, E not 2 or 5 – both satisfied.

Let’s try ""FESTS"".

Updated knowledge after three guesses:

1. Letters NOT in the word: R, A, I, B, O, M, F, T.
2. Letters that ARE in the word: S and E (both still in wrong positions).
   - S has appeared in positions 4 → wrong, 3 → wrong, 2 → wrong, and again in 4 → wrong.  
     So S must be in position 1 or 5 (positions 2, 3, 4 are all ruled out).
   - E has appeared in positions 5 → wrong, 2 → wrong, and 1 → wrong.  
     So E must be in position 3 or 4 (positions 1, 2, 5 are all ruled out).

3. Allowed letters left: C, D, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus S and E which we know are present).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains exactly one S (because we’ve only seen one S so far) and one E.
- Places S in position 1 or 5.
- Places E in position 3 or 4.
- Uses only allowed letters for the remaining three positions.

Let’s enumerate the two S placements:

Case 1: S in position 1 (S _ _ _ _)
   - E must be in 3 or 4.
   - Possible patterns: S E _ _ _  or  S _ E _ _  or  S _ _ E _  or  S _ _ _ E  (but E can’t be in 5).
   - From previous feedback, E can’t be in 1, 2, or 5, so in S _ _ _ _ pattern, E must be in 3 or 4.
   - Possible words: SCENE (but C and N are allowed), SPEEK (but P and K are allowed), SKENE (but K is allowed, N and E are allowed).

Case 2: S in position 5 (_ _ _ _ S)
   - E must be in 3 or 4.
   - Possible patterns: _ _ E _ S  or  _ _ _ E S.
   - Possible words: CLEWS (but C, L, W are allowed), DEESS (but D and S are allowed, but double S is unlikely), PLEBS (but P, L, B are allowed, but B is out), GEEPS (but G, P are allowed).

Let’s pick the most common letters first. SCENE uses C and N, both allowed. Let’s try SCENE.

- SCENE: S (1), C, E (3), N, E (4) – but this has two Es, and we only know one E exists. So this is invalid.

Next candidate: SPEEK – S (1), P, E (3), E (4) – again two Es. Invalid.

Next: SKEPT – but T is out.

Next: SPECK – S (1), P, E (3), C, K – valid: one S, one E, all letters allowed, positions S1, E3. This seems good.

Let’s verify: S (1) – allowed position, E (3) – allowed position. P, C, K are all allowed letters not previously ruled out.

So the next guess is SPECK.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first word uses as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One such word is ""RAISE"" - it contains R, A, I, S, E, which are all very common letters. This will give us good coverage to determine which letters might be in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 4).
- E(-) → E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 5).

So we know:
- The word contains S and E, but not at positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain R, A, or I.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S and E.
2. Does not contain R, A, or I.
3. Has S not in position 4 and E not in position 5.

Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess should use new common letters while incorporating S and E. The word ""OCEAN"" comes to mind, but it contains A (invalid). ""STONE"" contains S and E but also has an O and N, and positions S at 1 and E at 5 (but E cannot be at 5). ""SENTE"" has S at 1 and E at 5 (invalid). ""STEEL"" has S at 1 and E at 4 (invalid). ""SENOR"" has R (invalid). 

""OCEAN"" is invalid due to A. ""TONES"" has S at 5 (invalid). ""OFTEN"" has E at 4, S at 5 (invalid). ""OUSTE"" is not a valid word. ""BESOM"" has S at 3, E at 2 - this seems valid: B, E, S, O, M. It does not contain R, A, or I, and positions S at 3 (not 4) and E at 2 (not 5). 

""BESOM"" is a valid word meaning a broomstick or to sweep away. It meets all constraints:

Current confirmed information:
- S is in the word and is in position 1 (✓ at position 1).
- E is in the word and is in position 3 (✓ at position 3).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, I, B, O, M, F, T, P, C, K.

So the pattern so far is:
S _ E _ _

We need three more letters (positions 2, 4, 5) from the remaining allowed letters:
D, G, H, J, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know from earlier feedback that:
- E must be in position 3 or 4 (but is now locked at 3).
- S must be in position 1 or 5 (but is now locked at 1).

Possible words fitting S _ E _ _:
- S L E E D (but D is allowed, and double E is unlikely since we only saw one E in feedback)
- S H E L F (but F is out)
- S W E E T (but T is out, and double E)
- S N E E D (double E again)
- S L E D S (double S)
- S W E E Z (but Z is allowed, and double E)

The simplest valid word with distinct letters and no ruled-out components is:
S H E L F — but F is out.
S N E E D — double E, but E is confirmed once, so invalid.
S W E E Z — double E, invalid.
S L E D S — double S, invalid.

Looking for valid words with single E and allowed letters:
S L E D S is invalid (double S).
S W E L L — but L is allowed, and W is allowed. Let's check:
S W E L L: S(1) W(2) E(3) L(4) L(5). Letters are all allowed (W, L not ruled out), and it's a valid word.

Another candidate: S W E E N — but double E.
S W E E Z — double E.
S N E L L — but N is allowed, L is allowed, but double L is possible, but we have no info on duplicates.

The most straightforward valid word without duplicates is SWELL.

Let's verify:
S W E L L:
- S in position 1: ✓ (confirmed)
- E in position 3: ✓ (confirmed)
- W, L, L: all letters not previously ruled out.
- No forbidden letters.

Thus, SWELL is a valid next guess.
