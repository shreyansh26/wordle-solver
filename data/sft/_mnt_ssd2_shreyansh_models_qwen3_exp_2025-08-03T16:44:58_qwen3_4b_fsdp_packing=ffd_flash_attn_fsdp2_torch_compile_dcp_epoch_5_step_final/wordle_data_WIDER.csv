### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage of high-frequency letters in both position and presence.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE  
Feedback: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)

Guess 2: RIDGE  
Feedback: R(-) I(✓) D(✓) G(x) E(-)

What we know so far:
- Letters not in the word: A, O, S, G  
- Letters that are in the word: I, D (and they are in the correct positions 2 and 3)  
- Letters that are in the word but not in the positions guessed: R (not in position 1 or 2), E (not in position 4 or 5)

So the pattern so far is: _ I D _ _

We also know:
- R must appear somewhere in the word, but not in position 1 or 2, so R must be in position 4 or 5.  
- E must appear somewhere in the word, but not in position 4 or 5, so E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  However, positions 2 and 3 are already taken by I and D, so E must be in position 1.

Therefore, the word must be: E I D _ _

We still need to place R somewhere.  Since R cannot be in position 1 or 2, and positions 2,3 are already taken, R must be in position 4 or 5.  We also know E must be in position 1 (as deduced above).

So the possible patterns are:
- E I D R _
- E I D _ R

We need to choose a word that fits these patterns, uses only allowed letters (no A, O, S, G), and is a valid 5-letter English word.

Looking at common letters left: B, C, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible candidates:
- EIDRY (but Y is sometimes considered vowel, but not common)
- EIDER (but E is already in position 1, and E is not allowed in position 4 or 5)
- EIDET (but T is possible)
- EIDOL (but O is excluded)
- EIDAN (but A is excluded)
- EIDET (but E is already in position 1, and E is not allowed in position 4 or 5)

Wait, let's think differently: since R must be in position 4 or 5, and E must be in position 1, we have:

Possible words:
- E I D R ?  (position 5 needs a letter)
- E I D ? R  (position 4 needs a letter)

Looking for valid words:
- EIDER is a valid word (but has D in position 4, but we have D in position 3)
- EIDET is not a valid word
- EIDER is actually a valid word, but let's check letters: E, I, D, E, R.  Letters used: E, I, D, R.  No forbidden letters (A, O, S, G).  E is allowed in position 1, I in 2, D in 3, E in 4 (but E is allowed in 4 because the feedback only said E is not in position 5).  Wait, the feedback on AROSE said E is in the word but not in position 5, so E could be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.  Similarly, R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2, so R could be in 3, 4, or 5.  But D is confirmed in position 3, so R must be in 4 or 5, and E must be in 1, 2, or 4 (but 2 is I, 3 is D, so E must be in 1 or 4).

But we have:
- positions: 1 2 3 4 5
- known: _ I D _ _
- letters in word: I, D, R, E
- no A, O, S, G

So possible placements:
- E must be in 1 or 4
- R must be in 4 or 5

Case 1: E in 1
Then word is: E I D _ _
R must be in 4 or 5
Possible words:
- E I D R ?  (position 5 needs a letter)
- E I D ? R  (position 4 needs a letter)

Looking for valid words:
- EIDER: E I D E R  (but D is already in position 3, so this would be E I D E R, but we have D in position 3, so this would be E I D E R, but this has D in position 3, E in 4, R in 5.  Letters used: E, I, D, E, R.  No forbidden letters.  This seems valid.
- EIDET: not valid
- EIDER is valid

Case 2: E in 4
Then word is: _ I D E _
R must be in 5
So word is: _ I D E R
Possible letters for position 1: any allowed letter not used yet (not A, O, S, G, and not I, D, E, R)
Common letters left: B, C, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible words:
- BIDER: not valid
- CIDER: not valid
- FIDER: not valid
- HIDER: not valid
- KIDER: not valid
- LIDER: not valid
- MIDER: not valid
- NIDER: not valid
- PIDER: not valid
- TIDER: not valid
- WIDER: valid word

So possible candidates: EIDER and WIDER.

Between these two, EIDER seems more likely as it uses E, I, D, E, R, which are all letters we know something about, and fits all constraints:
- E is allowed in position 1
- I in 2
- D in 3
- E in 4
- R in 5

No forbidden letters used.

Therefore, the next guess should be EIDER.
</think>

Based on the feedback from the previous two guesses, we know:
- The word contains I and D in positions 2 and 3.
- The word also contains R and E, but not in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 respectively.
- Forbidden letters: A, O, S, G.

The only remaining positions are 1, 4, and 5.  E must be in position 1 (since it cannot be in 4 or 5), and R must be in position 4 or 5 (since it cannot be in 1 or 2).  The only valid word fitting these constraints is EIDER.

- Letters that are in the word but not in the positions guessed: R (not in position 1 or 2), E (not in position 4 or 5)

- E must appear somewhere in the word, but not in position 4 or 5, so E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  However, positions 2 and 3 are already taken by I and D, so E must be in position 1.

We still need to place R somewhere.  Since R cannot be in position 1 or 2, and positions 2,3 are already taken, R must be in position 4 or 5.  We also know E must be in position 1 (as deduced above).

So the possible patterns are:

- EIDET (but T is possible)
- EIDOL (but O is excluded)
- EIDAN (but A is excluded)
- EIDET (but E is already in position 1, and E is not allowed in position 4 or 5)

Wait, let's think differently: since R must be in position 4 or 5, and E must be in position 1, we have:

Possible words:
- E I D R ?  (position 5 needs a letter)
- E I D ? R  (position 4 needs a letter)

Looking for valid words:

- EIDET is not a valid word
- EIDER is actually a valid word, but let's check letters: E, I, D, E, R.  Letters used: E, I, D, R.  No forbidden letters (A, O, S, G).  E is allowed in position 1, I in 2, D in 3, E in 4 (but E is allowed in 4 because the feedback only said E is not in position 5).

But D is confirmed in position 3, so R must be in 4 or 5, and E must be in 1, 2, or 4 (but 2 is I, 3 is D, so E must be in 1 or 4).

But we have:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage of high-frequency letters in both position and presence.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S
- Letters definitely present: R (not at position 2), E (not at position 5)

I want a new word that:
1. Contains R and E
2. Doesn’t contain A, O, S
3. Places R and E in new positions (R ≠ 2, E ≠ 5)
4. Uses other common letters to gather more information

A good candidate is “RIDGE”:
- R is now in position 1 (not 2, satisfying the feedback)
- E is now in position 4 (not 5, satisfying the feedback)
- Common letters D and G are introduced
- Doesn’t use any excluded letters (A, O, S)

Let’s try it.

Guess 2: RIDGE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(✓) D(✓) G(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE  
Feedback: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)

Guess 2: RIDGE  
Feedback: R(-) I(✓) D(✓) G(x) E(-)

What we know so far:
- Letters not in the word: A, O, S, G  
- Letters that are in the word: I, D (and they are in the correct positions 2 and 3)  
- Letters that are in the word but not in the positions guessed: R (not in position 1 or 2), E (not in position 4 or 5)

So the pattern so far is: _ I D _ _

We also know:
- R must appear somewhere in the word, but not in position 1 or 2, so R must be in position 4 or 5.  
- E must appear somewhere in the word, but not in position 4 or 5, so E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  However, positions 2 and 3 are already taken by I and D, so E must be in position 1.

Therefore, the word must be: E I D _ _

We still need to place R somewhere.  Since R cannot be in position 1 or 2, and positions 2,3 are already taken, R must be in position 4 or 5.  We also know E must be in position 1 (as deduced above).

So the possible patterns are:
- E I D R _
- E I D _ R

We need to choose a word that fits these patterns, uses only allowed letters (no A, O, S, G), and is a valid 5-letter English word.

Looking at common letters left: B, C, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible candidates:
- EIDRY (but Y is sometimes considered vowel, but not common)
- EIDER (but E is already in position 1, and E is not allowed in position 4 or 5)
- EIDET (but T is possible)
- EIDOL (but O is excluded)
- EIDAN (but A is excluded)
- EIDET (but E is already in position 1, and E is not allowed in position 4 or 5)

Wait, let's think differently: since R must be in position 4 or 5, and E must be in position 1, we have:

Possible words:
- E I D R ?  (position 5 needs a letter)
- E I D ? R  (position 4 needs a letter)

Looking for valid words:
- EIDER is a valid word (but has D in position 4, but we have D in position 3)
- EIDET is not a valid word
- EIDER is actually a valid word, but let's check letters: E, I, D, E, R.  Letters used: E, I, D, R.  No forbidden letters (A, O, S, G).  E is allowed in position 1, I in 2, D in 3, E in 4 (but E is allowed in 4 because the feedback only said E is not in position 5).  Wait, the feedback on AROSE said E is in the word but not in position 5, so E could be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.  Similarly, R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2, so R could be in 3, 4, or 5.  But D is confirmed in position 3, so R must be in 4 or 5, and E must be in 1, 2, or 4 (but 2 is I, 3 is D, so E must be in 1 or 4).

But we have:
- positions: 1 2 3 4 5
- known: _ I D _ _
- letters in word: I, D, R, E
- no A, O, S, G

So possible placements:
- E must be in 1 or 4
- R must be in 4 or 5

Case 1: E in 1
Then word is: E I D _ _
R must be in 4 or 5
Possible words:
- E I D R ?  (position 5 needs a letter)
- E I D ? R  (position 4 needs a letter)

Looking for valid words:
- EIDER: E I D E R  (but D is already in position 3, so this would be E I D E R, but we have D in position 3, so this would be E I D E R, but this has D in position 3, E in 4, R in 5.  Letters used: E, I, D, E, R.  No forbidden letters.  This seems valid.
- EIDET: not valid
- EIDER is valid

Case 2: E in 4
Then word is: _ I D E _
R must be in 5
So word is: _ I D E R
Possible letters for position 1: any allowed letter not used yet (not A, O, S, G, and not I, D, E, R)
Common letters left: B, C, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible words:
- BIDER: not valid
- CIDER: not valid
- FIDER: not valid
- HIDER: not valid
- KIDER: not valid
- LIDER: not valid
- MIDER: not valid
- NIDER: not valid
- PIDER: not valid
- TIDER: not valid
- WIDER: valid word

So possible candidates: EIDER and WIDER.

Between these two, EIDER seems more likely as it uses E, I, D, E, R, which are all letters we know something about, and fits all constraints:
- E is allowed in position 1
- I in 2
- D in 3
- E in 4
- R in 5

No forbidden letters used.

Therefore, the next guess should be EIDER.Based on the feedback from the previous two guesses, we know:
- The word contains I and D in positions 2 and 3.
- The word also contains R and E, but not in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 respectively.
- Forbidden letters: A, O, S, G.

The only remaining positions are 1, 4, and 5.  E must be in position 1 (since it cannot be in 4 or 5), and R must be in position 4 or 5 (since it cannot be in 1 or 2).  The only valid word fitting these constraints is EIDER.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S
- Letters definitely present: R (not at position 2), E (not at position 5)

I want a new word that:
1. Contains R and E
2. Doesn’t contain A, O, S
3. Places R and E in new positions (R ≠ 2, E ≠ 5)
4. Uses other common letters to gather more information

A good candidate is “RIDGE”:
- R is now in position 1 (not 2, satisfying the feedback)
- E is now in position 4 (not 5, satisfying the feedback)
- Common letters D and G are introduced
- Doesn’t use any excluded letters (A, O, S)

Guess 1: AROSE  
Feedback: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)

Guess 2: RIDGE  
Feedback: R(-) I(✓) D(✓) G(x) E(-)

What we know so far:
- Letters not in the word: A, O, S, G  
- Letters that are in the word: I, D (and they are in the correct positions 2 and 3)  
- Letters that are in the word but not in the positions guessed: R (not in position 1 or 2), E (not in position 4 or 5)

So the pattern so far is: _ I D _ _

We also know:
- R must appear somewhere in the word, but not in position 1 or 2, so R must be in position 4 or 5.  
- E must appear somewhere in the word, but not in position 4 or 5, so E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  However, positions 2 and 3 are already taken by I and D, so E must be in position 1.

Therefore, the word must be: E I D _ _

We still need to place R somewhere.  Since R cannot be in position 1 or 2, and positions 2,3 are already taken, R must be in position 4 or 5.  We also know E must be in position 1 (as deduced above).

So the possible patterns are:
- E I D R _
- E I D _ R

We need to choose a word that fits these patterns, uses only allowed letters (no A, O, S, G), and is a valid 5-letter English word.

Looking at common letters left: B, C, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible candidates:
- EIDRY (but Y is sometimes considered vowel, but not common)
- EIDER (but E is already in position 1, and E is not allowed in position 4 or 5)
- EIDET (but T is possible)
- EIDOL (but O is excluded)
- EIDAN (but A is excluded)
- EIDET (but E is already in position 1, and E is not allowed in position 4 or 5)

Wait, let's think differently: since R must be in position 4 or 5, and E must be in position 1, we have:

Possible words:
- E I D R ?  (position 5 needs a letter)
- E I D ? R  (position 4 needs a letter)

Looking for valid words:
- EIDER is a valid word (but has D in position 4, but we have D in position 3)
- EIDET is not a valid word
- EIDER is actually a valid word, but let's check letters: E, I, D, E, R.  Letters used: E, I, D, R.  No forbidden letters (A, O, S, G).  E is allowed in position 1, I in 2, D in 3, E in 4 (but E is allowed in 4 because the feedback only said E is not in position 5).  Wait, the feedback on AROSE said E is in the word but not in position 5, so E could be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.  Similarly, R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2, so R could be in 3, 4, or 5.  But D is confirmed in position 3, so R must be in 4 or 5, and E must be in 1, 2, or 4 (but 2 is I, 3 is D, so E must be in 1 or 4).

But we have:
- positions: 1 2 3 4 5
- known: _ I D _ _
- letters in word: I, D, R, E
- no A, O, S, G

So possible placements:
- E must be in 1 or 4
- R must be in 4 or 5

Case 1: E in 1
Then word is: E I D _ _
R must be in 4 or 5
Possible words:
- E I D R ?  (position 5 needs a letter)
- E I D ? R  (position 4 needs a letter)

Looking for valid words:
- EIDER: E I D E R  (but D is already in position 3, so this would be E I D E R, but we have D in position 3, so this would be E I D E R, but this has D in position 3, E in 4, R in 5.  Letters used: E, I, D, E, R.  No forbidden letters.  This seems valid.
- EIDET: not valid
- EIDER is valid

Case 2: E in 4
Then word is: _ I D E _
R must be in 5
So word is: _ I D E R
Possible letters for position 1: any allowed letter not used yet (not A, O, S, G, and not I, D, E, R)
Common letters left: B, C, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible words:
- BIDER: not valid
- CIDER: not valid
- FIDER: not valid
- HIDER: not valid
- KIDER: not valid
- LIDER: not valid
- MIDER: not valid
- NIDER: not valid
- PIDER: not valid
- TIDER: not valid
- WIDER: valid word

So possible candidates: EIDER and WIDER.

Between these two, EIDER seems more likely as it uses E, I, D, E, R, which are all letters we know something about, and fits all constraints:
- E is allowed in position 1
- I in 2
- D in 3
- E in 4
- R in 5

No forbidden letters used.

Therefore, the next guess should be EIDER.Based on the feedback from the previous two guesses, we know:
- The word contains I and D in positions 2 and 3.
- The word also contains R and E, but not in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 respectively.
- Forbidden letters: A, O, S, G.

The only remaining positions are 1, 4, and 5.  E must be in position 1 (since it cannot be in 4 or 5), and R must be in position 4 or 5 (since it cannot be in 1 or 2).  The only valid word fitting these constraints is EIDER.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: RIDGE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(✓) D(✓) G(x) E(-)
Guess 3: EIDER -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) D(✓) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on EIDER:

E(-)  → E is in the word but NOT in position 1  
I(✓)  → I is in the word AND in position 2  
D(✓)  → D is in the word AND in position 3  
E(✓)  → E is in the word AND in position 4  
R(✓)  → R is in the word AND in position 5  

So the word is now fully determined:  
Position 1: must be a letter that is NOT E (because E is only allowed in positions 2-5 and is already in 4).  
Positions 2-5: I, D, E, R (in that order).  

Letters already excluded: A, O, S, G.  
Letters already used: I, D, E, R.  

The only remaining common letter for position 1 is B, C, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z that hasn’t appeared and is not forbidden.  The most plausible single-letter possibilities are B, C, F, H, K, L, M, N, P, T.  

Among these, the only valid English 5-letter words that fit are:  
- B I D E R → “BI DER” (not valid)  
- C I D E R → “CIDER” (valid)  
- F I D E R → “FI DER” (not valid)  
- H I D E R → “HI DER” (not valid)  
- K I D E R → “KI DER” (not valid)  
- L I D E R → “LI DER” (not valid)  
- M I D E R → “MI DER” (not valid)  
- N I D E R → “NI DER” (not valid)  
- P I D E R → “PI DER” (not valid)  
- T I D E R → “TI DER” (not valid)  

The only valid English word is CIDER.
