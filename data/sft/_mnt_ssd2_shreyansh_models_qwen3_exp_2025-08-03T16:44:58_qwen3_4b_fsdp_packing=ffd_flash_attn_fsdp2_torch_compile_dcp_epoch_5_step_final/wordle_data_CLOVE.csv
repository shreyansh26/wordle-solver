### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it includes common consonants and two vowels. However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This should give us excellent coverage for future guesses based on the feedback.

After considering other options like ""CRANE"" or ""ADIEU"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides the best mix of high-frequency letters in a 5-letter word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd spot).
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (5th spot).

So we know the pattern is: _ _ O _ E, and the letters A, R, S are excluded.

Good letters to try next include consonants that haven’t been ruled out (B, C, D, F, G, H, etc.) and vowels that haven’t been ruled out (I, U).  
I’ll pick a word that keeps O and E fixed, uses new letters, and tries to reveal more consonants and possibly the second vowel (I or U).

A good candidate is “CHOKE”:
- C, H, K are new consonants.
- O and E are confirmed in place.
- It doesn’t use A, R, or S.
