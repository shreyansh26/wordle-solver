### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) without any duplicates. This will help me quickly identify which of these key letters are in the secret word and their potential positions.

Next option: ""INERT"" - but E is in position 5 again (invalid).

""TIMER"" - but R is in position 5, which is allowed (since R is not forbidden anywhere), and E is in position 4 (allowed). Also, no A, O, S, and tests T, I, M.

This seems good: TIMER
- Contains R and E

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: timer -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) M(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on TIMER:
- T(x) → T is not in the word.
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- M(x) → M is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4).
- R(✓) → R is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5).

So the secret word ends in “ER”.

Known so far:
- Letters in the word: R (position 5), E (position 4)
- Letters not in the word: A, O, S, T, I, M
- Still need to determine positions 1, 2, 3.

Good remaining common letters to test: N, L, C, U, D, H, G, B, F, K, Y, V, W, etc.

I want a word that:
- Ends in “ER”
- Uses only unused letters (no A, O, S, T, I, M)
- Tests new letters in positions 1, 2, 3.

Possible candidates:
- “UNHER” – but H hasn’t been tested yet, and U is common. However, “UNHER” isn’t a valid 5-letter word.
- “FLHER” – invalid word.
- “NURER” – invalid word.
- “DULER” – invalid word.
- “BURER” – invalid word.
- “FURER” – invalid word.
- “HURER” – invalid word.
- “GULER” – invalid word.
- “DWER” – too short.
- “BUNER” – invalid word.

Wait, let me think of valid words ending in “ER” that don’t use A, O, S, T, I, M.

Valid words:
- “HURER” – not valid.
- “NURER” – not valid.
- “DURER” – not valid.
- “FURER” – not valid.
- “GURER” – not valid.
- “BUNER” – not valid.
- “LUNER” – not valid.
- “FUNER” – not valid.
- “GONER” – but O is already excluded.
- “RUNER” – R is already in position 5.
- “LUNER” – not valid.
- “BUNER” – not valid.

Hmm, maybe “FLIER” – but I is excluded.
“CLER” – too short.
“ULCER” – but U is allowed, C is allowed, but let’s check:
- U L C E R: positions 1-5. Letters: U, L, C, E, R. No A, O, S, T, I, M. E is in position 4, R in 5. This is valid.

“ULCER” is a valid 5-letter word. It tests U, L, C in positions 1-3, which are all new letters not yet ruled out.

So the next guess should be “ULCER”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) without any duplicates. This will help me quickly identify which of these key letters are in the secret word and their potential positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: R, E
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, O, S
- R is not in position 2
- E is not in position 5

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and E
2. Does not contain A, O, S
3. Has R not in position 2
4. Has E not in position 5

Good remaining common letters to test: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, H, M, G, B, F, K, Y, V, W, Z, X, Q, J.

Let me think of a word that fits these constraints and uses other common letters. ""UNTIE"" comes to mind, but it has I and T which are good letters, and U is also common. However, I need to check positions:
- U N T I E: R is not in position 2 (it's not present here), E is in position 5 (which is invalid per feedback).

Next option: ""INERT"" - but E is in position 5 again (invalid).

""TIMER"" - but R is in position 5, which is allowed (since R is not forbidden anywhere), and E is in position 4 (allowed). Also, no A, O, S, and tests T, I, M.

This seems good: TIMER
- Contains R and E
- No A, O, S
- R is in position 5 (allowed)
- E is in position 4 (allowed)
- Tests new letters T, I, M

From the new feedback on TIMER:
- T(x) → T is not in the word.
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- M(x) → M is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4).
- R(✓) → R is in the word AND in the correct position (position 5).

So the secret word ends in “ER”.

Known so far:
- Letters in the word: R (position 5), E (position 4)
- Letters not in the word: A, O, S, T, I, M
- Still need to determine positions 1, 2, 3.

Good remaining common letters to test: N, L, C, U, D, H, G, B, F, K, Y, V, W, etc.

I want a word that:
- Ends in “ER”
- Uses only unused letters (no A, O, S, T, I, M)
- Tests new letters in positions 1, 2, 3.

Possible candidates:
- “UNHER” – but H hasn’t been tested yet, and U is common. However, “UNHER” isn’t a valid 5-letter word.
- “FLHER” – invalid word.
- “NURER” – invalid word.
- “DULER” – invalid word.
- “BURER” – invalid word.
- “FURER” – invalid word.
- “HURER” – invalid word.
- “GULER” – invalid word.
- “DWER” – too short.
- “BUNER” – invalid word.

Wait, let me think of valid words ending in “ER” that don’t use A, O, S, T, I, M.

Valid words:
- “HURER” – not valid.
- “NURER” – not valid.
- “DURER” – not valid.
- “FURER” – not valid.
- “GURER” – not valid.
- “BUNER” – not valid.
- “LUNER” – not valid.
- “FUNER” – not valid.
- “GONER” – but O is already excluded.
- “RUNER” – R is already in position 5.
- “LUNER” – not valid.
- “BUNER” – not valid.

Hmm, maybe “FLIER” – but I is excluded.
“CLER” – too short.
“ULCER” – but U is allowed, C is allowed, but let’s check:
- U L C E R: positions 1-5. Letters: U, L, C, E, R. No A, O, S, T, I, M. E is in position 4, R in 5. This is valid.

“ULCER” is a valid 5-letter word. It tests U, L, C in positions 1-3, which are all new letters not yet ruled out.

So the next guess should be “ULCER”.
