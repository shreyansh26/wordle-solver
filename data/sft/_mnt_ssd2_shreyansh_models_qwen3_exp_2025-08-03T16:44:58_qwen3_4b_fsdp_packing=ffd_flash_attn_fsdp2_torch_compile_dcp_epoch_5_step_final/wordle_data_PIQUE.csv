Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This gives us good coverage of common letters while also allowing for multiple vowels in the word, which can be helpful in confirming or eliminating vowels in subsequent guesses.

We know:
- E is in the word and in the correct final position.
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and none of S, L, A, T appear.  
We still need to test other common letters to narrow it down.  
Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, B, D, G, M, P, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are already tested).

I’ll pick a word that keeps E in the last spot and introduces new common letters.  
""CRONE"" uses C, R, O, N, E – none of the letters S, L, A, T are present, and it tests several new common letters.  
""BRINE"" would also work, but CRONE feels slightly more balanced.

Current knowledge:
- Position 5 is definitely E.
- P is correctly in position 1.
- I is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 3.
- Letters ruled out so far: S, L, A, T, C, R, O, N, H, M.

Remaining common letters not yet tested: B, D, F, G, K, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We have the pattern: P _ _ _ E
I must appear in position 2, 4, or possibly 1 (but 1 is P) so positions 2 or 4.

Let’s test a word that places I in position 2 and introduces new common consonants.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This gives us good coverage of common letters while also allowing for multiple vowels in the word, which can be helpful in confirming or eliminating vowels in subsequent guesses.

We know:
- E is in the word and in the correct final position.
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and none of S, L, A, T appear.  
We still need to test other common letters to narrow it down.  
Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, B, D, G, M, P, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are already tested).

I’ll pick a word that keeps E in the last spot and introduces new common letters.  
""CRONE"" uses C, R, O, N, E – none of the letters S, L, A, T are present, and it tests several new common letters.  
""BRINE"" would also work, but CRONE feels slightly more balanced.

We still need to test vowels (I, U) and several high-frequency consonants (B, D, G, H, M, P).  
A good next word should include a mix of these, keep E in position 5, and avoid any already-eliminated letters.

""PHIME"" uses P, H, I, M, E – none of the eliminated letters appear, and it tests several new consonants plus the vowel I.

Available common letters: B, F, G, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we want the most common ones).

Thus, the only valid word left is PIFFE.

But wait, let’s double-check: PIFFE is P-I-F-F-E, which is 5 letters, E in position 5, I in position 2, P in position 1, and F in positions 3 and 4. All letters used are allowed (F not yet ruled out).

We now have:

1. P ✓ in position 1  
2. I ✓ in position 2  
3. E ✓ in position 5  
4. Letters definitely absent: S, L, A, T, C, R, O, N, H, M, K, D  

So the pattern is: P I _ _ E  
We still need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters not yet ruled out.  
Available common letters: B, F, G, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we want the most common ones).

Looking for real 5-letter words that fit P I _ _ E:

- PIFFE – but F is repeated, and F is allowed.  
- PIGE – too short.  
- PIKED – already tried.  
- PILOT – T is ruled out.  
- PIVED – already tried.  
- PIWEE – W and E, but E is already in position 5.  
- PIYEE – Y and E, but again E is already in position 5.  

Actually, let’s list all valid English words fitting P I _ _ E:

1. PIFFE – valid (British slang)  
2. PIKED – already tried  
3. PILOT – T ruled out  
4. PIVED – already tried  
5. PIWEE – valid (slang)  
6. PIYEE – invalid (not a word)  

Between PIFFE and PIWEE, both are valid, but PIFFE uses F twice, which is allowed and tests F in position 3 and F in position 4. PIWEE would use W in position 3 and E in position 4, but E is already fixed in position 5. So PIWEE is invalid (it’s 5 letters but E is only in position 5).

Thus, the only valid word left is PIFFE.

But wait, let’s double-check: PIFFE is P-I-F-F-E, which is 5 letters, E in position 5, I in position 2, P in position 1, and F in positions 3 and 4. All letters used are allowed (F not yet ruled out).

So the next guess is PIFFE.

We now know:

1. P ✓ in position 1  
2. I ✓ in position 2  
3. E ✓ in position 5  
4. Letters definitely absent: S, L, A, T, C, R, O, N, H, M, K, D, F  

So the pattern is: P I _ _ E  
We still need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters not yet ruled out.  
Available common letters (not yet excluded): B, G, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we want the most common ones).

Real 5-letter English words that fit P I _ _ E:

- PIQUE – but Q is in position 4, and we need to test common letters first.  
- PIKED – already tried.  
- PILOT – T is ruled out.  
- PIVED – already tried.  
- PIWEE – already considered.  
- PIYEE – invalid.  

Looking again, the only remaining valid and common word is PIQUE, but Q is not yet tested. However, Q is quite uncommon in such positions, and we might want to test G or B first.

Another valid word is PIVED, but V is allowed and common. Wait, PIVED is already tried.

Wait, let’s list all valid English words fitting P I _ _ E:

1. PIFFE – tried  
2. PIKED – tried  
3. PILOT – T ruled out  
4. PIVED – tried  
5. PIWEE – tried  

It appears the only remaining valid word is PIQUE, but Q is not yet ruled out. However, Q is less common. Let’s check if there are others.

Actually, there’s one more: PIKED is tried, PIQUE is the only other common word. But K is already ruled out.

Wait, let’s think differently: maybe the word is PIQUE, but K is already ruled out, so that’s not possible.

Realizing that, the only remaining valid word fitting the pattern and the allowed letters is PIQUE, but K is already excluded. This suggests we might have missed one.

Looking back, the word PIQUE uses Q and U, both not yet ruled out. So PIQUE is possible.

But let’s double-check: PIQUE is P-I-Q-U-E, which fits the pattern P I _ _ E with Q in position 3 and U in position 4. Neither Q nor U has been ruled out yet.

Thus, PIQUE is the next valid guess.

However, let’s confirm if PIQUE is the only option. Another possibility is PIKED, but K is excluded. PILOT is invalid (T excluded). PIVED is invalid (D excluded). PIFFE is invalid (F excluded). PIWEE is invalid (W and E, but E is already in position 5).

Thus, PIQUE is indeed the only remaining valid word.

But wait, let’s check PIQUE: P I Q U E – all letters allowed (Q and U not yet excluded). So this is valid.

Therefore, the next guess is PIQUE.
