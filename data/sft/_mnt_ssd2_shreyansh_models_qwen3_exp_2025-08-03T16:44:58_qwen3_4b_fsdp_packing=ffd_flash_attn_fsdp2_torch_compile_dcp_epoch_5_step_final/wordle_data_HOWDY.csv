### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. 

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions, allowing us to gather useful information regardless of the feedback.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are **not present** in the secret word.

A balanced next guess is “ROUND”:

Current information:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N
- Letters known to be in the word: O (in the correct position, 2nd spot)
- Letters known to be in the word but not in the 5th spot: D

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ _

We know D is somewhere in the word, but not in the 5th position. Possible positions for D: 1st, 3rd, or 4th.

We need to pick a word that:
1. Has O in the 2nd position.
2. Contains D somewhere (not at the end).
3. Uses only letters that haven't been ruled out (avoid S,L,A,T,E,R,U,N).

Good remaining consonants: C, H, M, B, F, G, K, P, V, W, Y
Good remaining vowels: I (since A and E are out, and O is already used)

Possible candidates:
- Could try ""C O D Y "" but Y might be less common.
- ""H O D I "" but D would be 3rd and I 4th, but we need 5 letters.
- ""B O D I "" but again need 5 letters.
- ""M O D I "" but same issue.
- ""P O D I "" but same issue.

Wait, we need a 5-letter word with O in 2nd and D somewhere else. Let's think:
- _ O _ _ D: but D can't be 5th (from feedback D is in word but wrong position, and in ROUND D was 5th, so it's not 5th). So D must be 1st, 3rd, or 4th.
- D O _ _ _: but O is already 2nd, so D can't be 1st (since O is 2nd). So D must be 3rd or 4th.
- _ O D _ _: D 3rd
- _ O _ D _: D 4th

Let's try to pick a word:
- ""C O D _ "": CODIN? Not a word.
- ""H O D _ "": HODAD? Not 5 letters unique.
- ""M O D _ "": MODAL? A is out.
- ""P O D _ "": PODIA? A is out.
- ""B O D _ "": BODGE? G and E, E is out.
- ""F O D _ "": FODDER? R is out.
- ""V O D _ "": VODKA? A is out.
- ""W O D _ "": WODGE? G and E, E is out.
- ""M O D D "": MODD? Not a word.
- ""P O D D "": POPD? Not a word.

Hmm, maybe try D as 3rd:
- _ O D _ _: Could be ""C O D _ "" but need 5th letter. ""CODIN"" is not valid.
- ""H O D _ "": HODIN? Not valid.
- ""M O D _ "": MODIN? Not valid.
- ""B O D _ "": BODGE? E is out.
- ""F O D _ "": FODGE? E is out.

- ""H O _ D "" - ""HOIST"" - I is possible, S is out.
- ""M O _ D "" - ""MOULD"" - U is out.

- ""V O _ D "" - ""VOGUE"" - U is out.
- ""K O _ D "" - ""KOGOD"" - not valid.

Wait, ""H O I D _"" - but need 5 letters. ""HOIST"" - S is out.
""V O G D _"" - not valid.

Try ""M O D I "" but need 5 letters. ""MODIC"" - not valid.

Maybe try ""C O D I "" - ""CODIC"" - not valid.

Wait, ""P O D I "" - ""PODIA"" - A is out.

Hmm, seems limited. Maybe try ""C O D Y "" - ""CODYS"" - S is out.

Alternative: Maybe ""W O D I "" - ""WODGE"" - E is out.

Wait, let's think differently - maybe the word is ""C O D E "" but E is out.

This is tricky. Let me try ""V O D I "" - ""VODGE"" - E is out.

Wait, ""H O D I "" - ""HODGE"" - E is out.

""F O D I "" - ""FODGE"" - E is out.

""Y O D I "" - ""YODIE"" - E is out.

""Z O D I "" - ""ZODIA"" - A is out.

This is harder than expected. Let me try D as 1st:
- D O _ _ _: But O is 2nd, so D can't be 1st (since O is 2nd). So D must be 3rd or 4th.

Wait, no - D can be 1st, O is 2nd, so D could be 1st, but that would be D O _ _ _, but feedback says D is in word but wrong position (in ROUND, D was 5th, so it's not 5th, but could be 1st). 

But in ROUND, D was 5th and marked as ""-"". So D is in word but not 5th. So D could be 1st, 3rd, or 4th.

Let me try D as 1st:
- D O _ _ _: First letter D, second O, remaining letters must be from allowed ones (avoid S,L,A,T,E,R,U,N). 
Possible: D O M I ? - ""DOMIC"" - not valid.
D O M Y ? - ""DOMY"" - not 5 letters.
D O N ? - N is out.

""B O _ D "" - ""BOGGD"" - not valid.
""F O _ D "" - ""FOGGD"" - not valid.
""V O _ D "" - ""VOGGD"" - not valid.

This is challenging. Let me try ""M O D I "" - but need 5 letters. ""MODIC"" - not valid.

Wait, ""P O D G Y"" - but Y is possible, G is possible. ""PODGY"" - is this a word? Yes, ""podgy"" is slang for ""pudgy"".

Check letters: P, O, D, G, Y - none are in the excluded list (S,L,A,T,E,R,U,N). O is in correct position (2nd), D is included (4th), so this seems valid.

<guess>PODGY</guess>
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in the 2nd position.
- D is confirmed to be in the word but not in the 5th position.
- We must avoid all letters already ruled out (S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N).

A word that satisfies these constraints is “PODGY”, which places D in the 4th position and keeps O in the 2nd.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. 

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions, allowing us to gather useful information regardless of the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are **not present** in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of the alphabet, so I need a word that avoids those five letters entirely.  
I also want to keep using common consonants and vowels that weren’t in SLATE.  
The remaining most common letters are: R, O, U, I, N, C, H, M, D, G, etc.

A balanced next guess is “ROUND”:  
- R, O, U, N, D are all still possible.  
- It gives us new information about five different letters while avoiding the known-absent ones.

Current information:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N
- Letters known to be in the word: O (in the correct position, 2nd spot)
- Letters known to be in the word but not in the 5th spot: D

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ _

We know D is somewhere in the word, but not in the 5th position. Possible positions for D: 1st, 3rd, or 4th.

We need to pick a word that:
1. Has O in the 2nd position.
2. Contains D somewhere (not at the end).
3. Uses only letters that haven't been ruled out (avoid S,L,A,T,E,R,U,N).

Good remaining consonants: C, H, M, B, F, G, K, P, V, W, Y
Good remaining vowels: I (since A and E are out, and O is already used)

Possible candidates:
- Could try ""C O D Y "" but Y might be less common.
- ""H O D I "" but D would be 3rd and I 4th, but we need 5 letters.
- ""B O D I "" but again need 5 letters.
- ""M O D I "" but same issue.
- ""P O D I "" but same issue.

Wait, we need a 5-letter word with O in 2nd and D somewhere else. Let's think:
- _ O _ _ D: but D can't be 5th (from feedback D is in word but wrong position, and in ROUND D was 5th, so it's not 5th). So D must be 1st, 3rd, or 4th.
- D O _ _ _: but O is already 2nd, so D can't be 1st (since O is 2nd). So D must be 3rd or 4th.
- _ O D _ _: D 3rd
- _ O _ D _: D 4th

Let's try to pick a word:
- ""C O D _ "": CODIN? Not a word.
- ""H O D _ "": HODAD? Not 5 letters unique.
- ""M O D _ "": MODAL? A is out.
- ""P O D _ "": PODIA? A is out.
- ""B O D _ "": BODGE? G and E, E is out.
- ""F O D _ "": FODDER? R is out.
- ""V O D _ "": VODKA? A is out.
- ""W O D _ "": WODGE? G and E, E is out.
- ""M O D D "": MODD? Not a word.
- ""P O D D "": POPD? Not a word.

Hmm, maybe try D as 3rd:
- _ O D _ _: Could be ""C O D _ "" but need 5th letter. ""CODIN"" is not valid.
- ""H O D _ "": HODIN? Not valid.
- ""M O D _ "": MODIN? Not valid.
- ""B O D _ "": BODGE? E is out.
- ""F O D _ "": FODGE? E is out.
- ""V O D _ "": VODGE? E is out.

Try D as 4th:
- _ O _ D _: Could be ""C O _ D "" but need 3rd letter. ""COULD"" - but U is out.
- ""H O _ D "" - ""HOIST"" - I is possible, S is out.
- ""M O _ D "" - ""MOULD"" - U is out.
- ""P O _ D "" - ""PODGY"" - Y is possible, G is possible.
- ""B O _ D "" - ""BOGGD"" - not valid.
- ""V O _ D "" - ""VOGUE"" - U is out.
- ""K O _ D "" - ""KOGOD"" - not valid.

Wait, ""H O I D _"" - but need 5 letters. ""HOIST"" - S is out.
""V O G D _"" - not valid.

Try ""M O D I "" but need 5 letters. ""MODIC"" - not valid.

Maybe try ""C O D I "" - ""CODIC"" - not valid.

Wait, ""P O D I "" - ""PODIA"" - A is out.

Hmm, seems limited. Maybe try ""C O D Y "" - ""CODYS"" - S is out.

Alternative: Maybe ""W O D I "" - ""WODGE"" - E is out.

Wait, let's think differently - maybe the word is ""C O D E "" but E is out.

This is tricky. Let me try ""V O D I "" - ""VODGE"" - E is out.

Wait, ""H O D I "" - ""HODGE"" - E is out.

""F O D I "" - ""FODGE"" - E is out.

""B O D I "" - ""BODGE"" - E is out.

""G O D I "" - ""GODIG"" - not valid.

""K O D I "" - ""KODIA"" - A is out.

""Y O D I "" - ""YODIE"" - E is out.

""Z O D I "" - ""ZODIA"" - A is out.

This is harder than expected. Let me try D as 1st:
- D O _ _ _: But O is 2nd, so D can't be 1st (since O is 2nd). So D must be 3rd or 4th.

Wait, no - D can be 1st, O is 2nd, so D could be 1st, but that would be D O _ _ _, but feedback says D is in word but wrong position (in ROUND, D was 5th, so it's not 5th, but could be 1st). 

But in ROUND, D was 5th and marked as ""-"". So D is in word but not 5th. So D could be 1st, 3rd, or 4th.

Let me try D as 1st:
- D O _ _ _: First letter D, second O, remaining letters must be from allowed ones (avoid S,L,A,T,E,R,U,N). 
Possible: D O M I ? - ""DOMIC"" - not valid.
D O M Y ? - ""DOMY"" - not 5 letters.
D O N ? - N is out.
D O C ? - ""DOC"" - too short.

D as 3rd:
- _ O D _ _: Could be ""C O D _ "" - ""CODIN"" - not valid.
""H O D _ "" - ""HODIN"" - not valid.
""M O D _ "" - ""MODIN"" - not valid.
""B O D _ "" - ""BODGE"" - E is out.
""F O D _ "" - ""FODGE"" - E is out.
""V O D _ "" - ""VODGE"" - E is out.

D as 4th:
- _ O _ D _: Could be ""C O _ D "" - ""COULD"" - U is out.
""H O _ D "" - ""HOIST"" - S is out.
""M O _ D "" - ""MOULD"" - U is out.
""B O _ D "" - ""BOGGD"" - not valid.
""F O _ D "" - ""FOGGD"" - not valid.
""V O _ D "" - ""VOGGD"" - not valid.

This is challenging. Let me try ""M O D I "" - but need 5 letters. ""MODIC"" - not valid.

Wait, ""P O D G Y"" - but Y is possible, G is possible. ""PODGY"" - is this a word? Yes, ""podgy"" is slang for ""pudgy"".

Check letters: P, O, D, G, Y - none are in the excluded list (S,L,A,T,E,R,U,N). O is in correct position (2nd), D is included (4th), so this seems valid.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. 

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions, allowing us to gather useful information regardless of the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are **not present** in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of the alphabet, so I need a word that avoids those five letters entirely.  
I also want to keep using common consonants and vowels that weren’t in SLATE.  
The remaining most common letters are: R, O, U, I, N, C, H, M, D, G, etc.

A balanced next guess is “ROUND”:  
- R, O, U, N, D are all still possible.  
- It gives us new information about five different letters while avoiding the known-absent ones.

Current information:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N
- Letters known to be in the word: O (in the correct position, 2nd spot)
- Letters known to be in the word but not in the 5th spot: D

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ _

We know D is somewhere in the word, but not in the 5th position. Possible positions for D: 1st, 3rd, or 4th.

We need to pick a word that:
1. Has O in the 2nd position.
2. Contains D somewhere (not at the end).
3. Uses only letters that haven't been ruled out (avoid S,L,A,T,E,R,U,N).

Good remaining consonants: C, H, M, B, F, G, K, P, V, W, Y
Good remaining vowels: I (since A and E are out, and O is already used)

Possible candidates:
- Could try ""C O D Y "" but Y might be less common.
- ""H O D I "" but D would be 3rd and I 4th, but we need 5 letters.
- ""B O D I "" but again need 5 letters.
- ""M O D I "" but same issue.
- ""P O D I "" but same issue.

Wait, we need a 5-letter word with O in 2nd and D somewhere else. Let's think:
- _ O _ _ D: but D can't be 5th (from feedback D is in word but wrong position, and in ROUND D was 5th, so it's not 5th). So D must be 1st, 3rd, or 4th.
- D O _ _ _: but O is already 2nd, so D can't be 1st (since O is 2nd). So D must be 3rd or 4th.
- _ O D _ _: D 3rd
- _ O _ D _: D 4th

Let's try to pick a word:
- ""C O D _ "": CODIN? Not a word.
- ""H O D _ "": HODAD? Not 5 letters unique.
- ""M O D _ "": MODAL? A is out.
- ""P O D _ "": PODIA? A is out.
- ""B O D _ "": BODGE? G and E, E is out.
- ""F O D _ "": FODDER? R is out.
- ""V O D _ "": VODKA? A is out.
- ""W O D _ "": WODGE? G and E, E is out.
- ""M O D D "": MODD? Not a word.
- ""P O D D "": POPD? Not a word.

Hmm, maybe try D as 3rd:
- _ O D _ _: Could be ""C O D _ "" but need 5th letter. ""CODIN"" is not valid.
- ""H O D _ "": HODIN? Not valid.
- ""M O D _ "": MODIN? Not valid.
- ""B O D _ "": BODGE? E is out.
- ""F O D _ "": FODGE? E is out.
- ""V O D _ "": VODGE? E is out.

Try D as 4th:
- _ O _ D _: Could be ""C O _ D "" but need 3rd letter. ""COULD"" - but U is out.
- ""H O _ D "" - ""HOIST"" - I is possible, S is out.
- ""M O _ D "" - ""MOULD"" - U is out.
- ""P O _ D "" - ""PODGY"" - Y is possible, G is possible.
- ""B O _ D "" - ""BOGGD"" - not valid.
- ""V O _ D "" - ""VOGUE"" - U is out.
- ""K O _ D "" - ""KOGOD"" - not valid.

Wait, ""H O I D _"" - but need 5 letters. ""HOIST"" - S is out.
""V O G D _"" - not valid.

Try ""M O D I "" but need 5 letters. ""MODIC"" - not valid.

Maybe try ""C O D I "" - ""CODIC"" - not valid.

Wait, ""P O D I "" - ""PODIA"" - A is out.

Hmm, seems limited. Maybe try ""C O D Y "" - ""CODYS"" - S is out.

Alternative: Maybe ""W O D I "" - ""WODGE"" - E is out.

Wait, let's think differently - maybe the word is ""C O D E "" but E is out.

This is tricky. Let me try ""V O D I "" - ""VODGE"" - E is out.

Wait, ""H O D I "" - ""HODGE"" - E is out.

""F O D I "" - ""FODGE"" - E is out.

""B O D I "" - ""BODGE"" - E is out.

""G O D I "" - ""GODIG"" - not valid.

""K O D I "" - ""KODIA"" - A is out.

""Y O D I "" - ""YODIE"" - E is out.

""Z O D I "" - ""ZODIA"" - A is out.

This is harder than expected. Let me try D as 1st:
- D O _ _ _: But O is 2nd, so D can't be 1st (since O is 2nd). So D must be 3rd or 4th.

Wait, no - D can be 1st, O is 2nd, so D could be 1st, but that would be D O _ _ _, but feedback says D is in word but wrong position (in ROUND, D was 5th, so it's not 5th, but could be 1st). 

But in ROUND, D was 5th and marked as ""-"". So D is in word but not 5th. So D could be 1st, 3rd, or 4th.

Let me try D as 1st:
- D O _ _ _: First letter D, second O, remaining letters must be from allowed ones (avoid S,L,A,T,E,R,U,N). 
Possible: D O M I ? - ""DOMIC"" - not valid.
D O M Y ? - ""DOMY"" - not 5 letters.
D O N ? - N is out.
D O C ? - ""DOC"" - too short.

D as 3rd:
- _ O D _ _: Could be ""C O D _ "" - ""CODIN"" - not valid.
""H O D _ "" - ""HODIN"" - not valid.
""M O D _ "" - ""MODIN"" - not valid.
""B O D _ "" - ""BODGE"" - E is out.
""F O D _ "" - ""FODGE"" - E is out.
""V O D _ "" - ""VODGE"" - E is out.

D as 4th:
- _ O _ D _: Could be ""C O _ D "" - ""COULD"" - U is out.
""H O _ D "" - ""HOIST"" - S is out.
""M O _ D "" - ""MOULD"" - U is out.
""B O _ D "" - ""BOGGD"" - not valid.
""F O _ D "" - ""FOGGD"" - not valid.
""V O _ D "" - ""VOGGD"" - not valid.

This is challenging. Let me try ""M O D I "" - but need 5 letters. ""MODIC"" - not valid.

Wait, ""P O D G Y"" - but Y is possible, G is possible. ""PODGY"" - is this a word? Yes, ""podgy"" is slang for ""pudgy"".

Check letters: P, O, D, G, Y - none are in the excluded list (S,L,A,T,E,R,U,N). O is in correct position (2nd), D is included (4th), so this seems valid.

<guess>PODGY</guess>Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in the 2nd position.
- D is confirmed to be in the word but not in the 5th position.
- We must avoid all letters already ruled out (S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N).

A word that satisfies these constraints is “PODGY”, which places D in the 4th position and keeps O in the 2nd.

Current information:
1. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, P, G
2. Letters known to be in the word and their positions:
   - O is in position 2
   - D is somewhere (but not positions 3 or 5)
   - Y is in position 5

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y with D in either position 1 or 4.

Remaining usable letters (avoiding the eliminated ones):
Consonants: B, C, F, H, J, K, M, V, W, Z
Vowels: I (only remaining common vowel)

We need to pick a word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Has Y in position 5
- Contains D in position 1 or 4
- Uses only the remaining letters

Option 1: D in position 1
Pattern: D O _ _ Y
Possible letters for positions 3 and 4: B, C, F, H, I, J, K, M, V, W, Z
Looking for common 5-letter words:
- DOUBY - not a valid word
- DOICY - not valid
- DOZER - but R is eliminated
- DOBRY - not valid
- DOKEY - K is allowed, E is eliminated
- DOVY - too short
- DOBIE - but E is eliminated

Option 2: D in position 4
Pattern: _ O _ D Y
Possible letters for positions 1 and 3: B, C, F, H, I, J, K, M, V, W, Z
Looking for common words:
- BOODY - B, O, O, D, Y - but O is already in position 2, so this would have two O's
- CODDY - C, O, D, D, Y - D is allowed twice, but we don't know if letters can repeat
- FOC DY - not valid
- HOODY - H, O, O, D, Y - two O's
- MOODY - M, O, O, D, Y - two O's
- VOODY - V, O, O, D, Y - two O's

The word ""MOODY"" is a valid English word with M, O, O, D, Y. It uses:
- M (allowed)
- O in position 2 (correct)
- O in position 3 (not yet ruled out)
- D in position 4 (allowed since D is confirmed in word but not in positions 3 or 5)
- Y in position 5 (correct)

This seems to be the most viable option.

Current information:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, P, G, M
- Letters confirmed in the word and their positions:
  - O is in position 2 (✓)
  - D is in position 4 (✓)
  - Y is in position 5 (✓)
- Additional info from MOODY:
  - O in position 3 is in the word but in the wrong position (-). Since O is already confirmed in position 2, this second O must be a duplicate letter somewhere else.

So the pattern is: _ O _ D Y with a second O somewhere in positions 1, 3 (but not 2 or 4 because those are already taken by O and D).

Possible positions for the second O:
1. Position 1: O O _ D Y
2. Position 3: _ O O D Y

Check which of these make valid 5-letter words using remaining letters (B, C, F, H, I, J, K, V, W, Z).

1. O O _ D Y:
   - OOBDY - not valid
   - OOCDY - not valid
   - OOFDY - not valid
   - OOHDY - not valid
   - OOVDY - not valid

2. _ O O D Y:
   - B O O D Y - BOODY (valid word)
   - C O O D Y - COODY (not valid)
   - F O O D Y - FOODY (not valid)
   - H O O D Y - HOODY (valid word)
   - V O O D Y - VOODY (valid word)

Among these, ""BOODY"", ""HOODY"", and ""VOODY"" are all valid. ""BOODY"" uses B, ""HOODY"" uses H, ""VOODY"" uses V. All these letters are still allowed.

Any of these would be correct, but I'll choose ""HOODY"" as it's a common word.

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, P, G, M
- Letters confirmed in the word and their positions:

  - D is in position 4 (✓)
  - Y is in position 5 (✓)
- Additional info from MOODY:
  - O in position 3 is in the word but in the wrong position (-). Since O is already confirmed in position 2, this second O must be a duplicate letter somewhere else.

So the pattern is: _ O _ D Y with a second O somewhere in positions 1, 3 (but not 2 or 4 because those are already taken by O and D).

Possible positions for the second O:
1. Position 1: O O _ D Y
2. Position 3: _ O O D Y

Check which of these make valid 5-letter words using remaining letters (B, C, F, H, I, J, K, V, W, Z).

Among these, ""BOODY"", ""HOODY"", and ""VOODY"" are all valid. ""BOODY"" uses B, ""HOODY"" uses H, ""VOODY"" uses V. All these letters are still allowed.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. 

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions, allowing us to gather useful information regardless of the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are **not present** in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of the alphabet, so I need a word that avoids those five letters entirely.  
I also want to keep using common consonants and vowels that weren’t in SLATE.  
The remaining most common letters are: R, O, U, I, N, C, H, M, D, G, etc.

A balanced next guess is “ROUND”:  
- R, O, U, N, D are all still possible.  
- It gives us new information about five different letters while avoiding the known-absent ones.

Current information:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N
- Letters known to be in the word: O (in the correct position, 2nd spot)
- Letters known to be in the word but not in the 5th spot: D

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ _

We know D is somewhere in the word, but not in the 5th position. Possible positions for D: 1st, 3rd, or 4th.

We need to pick a word that:
1. Has O in the 2nd position.
2. Contains D somewhere (not at the end).
3. Uses only letters that haven't been ruled out (avoid S,L,A,T,E,R,U,N).

Good remaining consonants: C, H, M, B, F, G, K, P, V, W, Y
Good remaining vowels: I (since A and E are out, and O is already used)

Possible candidates:
- Could try ""C O D Y "" but Y might be less common.
- ""H O D I "" but D would be 3rd and I 4th, but we need 5 letters.
- ""B O D I "" but again need 5 letters.
- ""M O D I "" but same issue.
- ""P O D I "" but same issue.

Wait, we need a 5-letter word with O in 2nd and D somewhere else. Let's think:
- _ O _ _ D: but D can't be 5th (from feedback D is in word but wrong position, and in ROUND D was 5th, so it's not 5th). So D must be 1st, 3rd, or 4th.
- D O _ _ _: but O is already 2nd, so D can't be 1st (since O is 2nd). So D must be 3rd or 4th.
- _ O D _ _: D 3rd
- _ O _ D _: D 4th

Let's try to pick a word:
- ""C O D _ "": CODIN? Not a word.
- ""H O D _ "": HODAD? Not 5 letters unique.
- ""M O D _ "": MODAL? A is out.
- ""P O D _ "": PODIA? A is out.
- ""B O D _ "": BODGE? G and E, E is out.
- ""F O D _ "": FODDER? R is out.
- ""V O D _ "": VODKA? A is out.
- ""W O D _ "": WODGE? G and E, E is out.
- ""M O D D "": MODD? Not a word.
- ""P O D D "": POPD? Not a word.

Hmm, maybe try D as 3rd:
- _ O D _ _: Could be ""C O D _ "" but need 5th letter. ""CODIN"" is not valid.
- ""H O D _ "": HODIN? Not valid.
- ""M O D _ "": MODIN? Not valid.
- ""B O D _ "": BODGE? E is out.
- ""F O D _ "": FODGE? E is out.
- ""V O D _ "": VODGE? E is out.

Try D as 4th:
- _ O _ D _: Could be ""C O _ D "" but need 3rd letter. ""COULD"" - but U is out.
- ""H O _ D "" - ""HOIST"" - I is possible, S is out.
- ""M O _ D "" - ""MOULD"" - U is out.
- ""P O _ D "" - ""PODGY"" - Y is possible, G is possible.
- ""B O _ D "" - ""BOGGD"" - not valid.
- ""V O _ D "" - ""VOGUE"" - U is out.
- ""K O _ D "" - ""KOGOD"" - not valid.

Wait, ""H O I D _"" - but need 5 letters. ""HOIST"" - S is out.
""V O G D _"" - not valid.

Try ""M O D I "" but need 5 letters. ""MODIC"" - not valid.

Maybe try ""C O D I "" - ""CODIC"" - not valid.

Wait, ""P O D I "" - ""PODIA"" - A is out.

Hmm, seems limited. Maybe try ""C O D Y "" - ""CODYS"" - S is out.

Alternative: Maybe ""W O D I "" - ""WODGE"" - E is out.

Wait, let's think differently - maybe the word is ""C O D E "" but E is out.

This is tricky. Let me try ""V O D I "" - ""VODGE"" - E is out.

Wait, ""H O D I "" - ""HODGE"" - E is out.

""F O D I "" - ""FODGE"" - E is out.

""B O D I "" - ""BODGE"" - E is out.

""G O D I "" - ""GODIG"" - not valid.

""K O D I "" - ""KODIA"" - A is out.

""Y O D I "" - ""YODIE"" - E is out.

""Z O D I "" - ""ZODIA"" - A is out.

This is harder than expected. Let me try D as 1st:
- D O _ _ _: But O is 2nd, so D can't be 1st (since O is 2nd). So D must be 3rd or 4th.

Wait, no - D can be 1st, O is 2nd, so D could be 1st, but that would be D O _ _ _, but feedback says D is in word but wrong position (in ROUND, D was 5th, so it's not 5th, but could be 1st). 

But in ROUND, D was 5th and marked as ""-"". So D is in word but not 5th. So D could be 1st, 3rd, or 4th.

Let me try D as 1st:
- D O _ _ _: First letter D, second O, remaining letters must be from allowed ones (avoid S,L,A,T,E,R,U,N). 
Possible: D O M I ? - ""DOMIC"" - not valid.
D O M Y ? - ""DOMY"" - not 5 letters.
D O N ? - N is out.
D O C ? - ""DOC"" - too short.

D as 3rd:
- _ O D _ _: Could be ""C O D _ "" - ""CODIN"" - not valid.
""H O D _ "" - ""HODIN"" - not valid.
""M O D _ "" - ""MODIN"" - not valid.
""B O D _ "" - ""BODGE"" - E is out.
""F O D _ "" - ""FODGE"" - E is out.
""V O D _ "" - ""VODGE"" - E is out.

D as 4th:
- _ O _ D _: Could be ""C O _ D "" - ""COULD"" - U is out.
""H O _ D "" - ""HOIST"" - S is out.
""M O _ D "" - ""MOULD"" - U is out.
""B O _ D "" - ""BOGGD"" - not valid.
""F O _ D "" - ""FOGGD"" - not valid.
""V O _ D "" - ""VOGGD"" - not valid.

This is challenging. Let me try ""M O D I "" - but need 5 letters. ""MODIC"" - not valid.

Wait, ""P O D G Y"" - but Y is possible, G is possible. ""PODGY"" - is this a word? Yes, ""podgy"" is slang for ""pudgy"".

Check letters: P, O, D, G, Y - none are in the excluded list (S,L,A,T,E,R,U,N). O is in correct position (2nd), D is included (4th), so this seems valid.

<guess>PODGY</guess>Based on the feedback:
- O is confirmed in the 2nd position.
- D is confirmed to be in the word but not in the 5th position.
- We must avoid all letters already ruled out (S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N).

A word that satisfies these constraints is “PODGY”, which places D in the 4th position and keeps O in the 2nd.

Current information:
1. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, P, G
2. Letters known to be in the word and their positions:
   - O is in position 2
   - D is somewhere (but not positions 3 or 5)
   - Y is in position 5

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y with D in either position 1 or 4.

Remaining usable letters (avoiding the eliminated ones):
Consonants: B, C, F, H, J, K, M, V, W, Z
Vowels: I (only remaining common vowel)

We need to pick a word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Has Y in position 5
- Contains D in position 1 or 4
- Uses only the remaining letters

Option 1: D in position 1
Pattern: D O _ _ Y
Possible letters for positions 3 and 4: B, C, F, H, I, J, K, M, V, W, Z
Looking for common 5-letter words:
- DOUBY - not a valid word
- DOICY - not valid
- DOZER - but R is eliminated
- DOBRY - not valid
- DOKEY - K is allowed, E is eliminated
- DOVY - too short
- DOBIE - but E is eliminated

Option 2: D in position 4
Pattern: _ O _ D Y
Possible letters for positions 1 and 3: B, C, F, H, I, J, K, M, V, W, Z
Looking for common words:
- BOODY - B, O, O, D, Y - but O is already in position 2, so this would have two O's
- CODDY - C, O, D, D, Y - D is allowed twice, but we don't know if letters can repeat
- FOC DY - not valid
- HOODY - H, O, O, D, Y - two O's
- MOODY - M, O, O, D, Y - two O's
- VOODY - V, O, O, D, Y - two O's

The word ""MOODY"" is a valid English word with M, O, O, D, Y. It uses:
- M (allowed)
- O in position 2 (correct)
- O in position 3 (not yet ruled out)
- D in position 4 (allowed since D is confirmed in word but not in positions 3 or 5)
- Y in position 5 (correct)

This seems to be the most viable option.

Current information:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, P, G, M
- Letters confirmed in the word and their positions:
  - H is in position 1 (✓)
  - O is in position 2 (✓)
  - D is in position 4 (✓)
  - Y is in position 5 (✓)
- From MOODY and HOODY feedback:
  - There is a second O in the word, but it is NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since O in position 2 and 4 are already correct, and O in position 3 was marked as wrong position in MOODY).
  - Therefore, the second O must be in position 1, but position 1 is already taken by H (✓).
  - This is a contradiction unless... we realize that the second O must be in position 3, but MOODY showed O(-) in position 3, meaning it's in the word but not in position 3.

Wait, let's re-examine:
- From MOODY: O in position 3 was marked (-), so O is in the word but not in position 3.
- From HOODY: H in position 1 is (✓), so H is fixed there.
- We already have O in position 2 (✓), D in position 4 (✓), Y in position 5 (✓).
- The second O must be in the remaining positions, but positions 1,2,4,5 are taken by H,O,D,Y respectively.
- This leaves only position 3, but MOODY showed O(-) in position 3, meaning O is not in position 3.

This implies there is no second O, which contradicts the earlier feedback. The only resolution is that the second O is actually in position 3, but MOODY said it's wrong position (-). This is impossible unless we interpret it as ""there is no second O, the first O is in position 2 and that's it"".

Thus, the word must be H O _ D Y with no second O, and the previous feedback about a second O was misinterpreted. The correct interpretation is that the letter in position 3 is not O, and the word has only one O in position 2.

So the pattern is: H O _ D Y
Available letters for position 3: remaining consonants B, C, F, I, J, K, V, W, Z (since vowels A, E, U, O are handled).

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- H O B D Y - HOBDY - not valid
- H O C D Y - HOCDY - not valid
- H O F D Y - HOFDY - not valid
- H O I D Y - HOIDY - not valid
- H O J D Y - HOJDY - not valid
- H O K D Y - HOODY - but O is already in position 2
- H O V D Y - HOVDY - not valid
- H O W D Y - HOWDY - valid word
- H O Z D Y - HOZDY - not valid

Thus, the only valid word is HOWDY.
