For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-1 consonants to maximize information gain. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This will help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Another good alternative might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong for a first guess due to its high vowel count and common consonants.

- E is in the word and is in the correct (5th) position.
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word is _ _ _ _ E with the letters A, R, O, S excluded.

Good remaining common consonants are T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, F, G, B, etc.
Good remaining common vowels are I, U (since A and O are out).

I want a word that:
1. Ends in E
2. Uses none of A, R, O, S
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Some candidates:
- TIGER → but R is excluded
- UNITY → but U is a vowel, N/T/Y are good
- ELITE → but E is already known at position 5, and L, I, T are good
- CHIME → C, H, I, M, E
- GLIDE → G, L, I, D, E

""CHIME"" looks good because it uses C, H, I, M, E - none of the excluded letters, and covers several new consonants and the vowel I.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-1 consonants to maximize information gain. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This will help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

We now know:
- E is in the word and is in the correct (5th) position.
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word is _ _ _ _ E with the letters A, R, O, S excluded.

Good remaining common consonants are T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, F, G, B, etc.
Good remaining common vowels are I, U (since A and O are out).

I want a word that:
1. Ends in E
2. Uses none of A, R, O, S
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Some candidates:
- TIGER → but R is excluded
- UNITY → but U is a vowel, N/T/Y are good
- ELITE → but E is already known at position 5, and L, I, T are good
- CHIME → C, H, I, M, E
- GLIDE → G, L, I, D, E

""CHIME"" looks good because it uses C, H, I, M, E - none of the excluded letters, and covers several new consonants and the vowel I.

Current knowledge:

- Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, S, C, H, M, W, D, B
- L is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4 (from BILGE feedback: L(-) in position 3 means it can’t be 3, and from WIELD feedback: L(-) in position 4 means it can’t be 4). Therefore L must be in position 1.

So the pattern is L I _ G E.

Remaining allowed letters (not yet excluded): F, J, K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching L I _ G E:
- L I G E ? – but we need 5 letters and G is in 4, E in 5.
- L I _ G E: possibilities are L I F G E, L I N G E, L I P G E, etc.

Real common words:
- ""LIFGE"" – not a word
- ""LINGE"" – not a word
- ""LIPGE"" – not a word
- ""LUGES"" – but U is allowed, S is excluded
- ""LITGE"" – not a word
- ""LIQUE"" – but Q is allowed, U is allowed, but would be L I Q U E, but G is in 4, so not matching pattern
- ""LIVGE"" – not a word
- ""LIKE G"" – but G is in 4, E in 5

Wait, let me list all possible letters for position 3: from remaining allowed letters (F, J, K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z).

Common word fitting L I ? G E:
- L I N G E – ""lining"" but ends in E, but ""lining"" is 6 letters
- L I G E ? – no, G is 4, E is 5
- Actually, looking for 5-letter words: L I ? G E.

Real words:
- L I N G E – ""lining"" is 6 letters, ""linge"" is not standard
- L I F G E – ""lifge"" – not a word
- L I P G E – ""lipge"" – not a word
- L I K G E – ""likge"" – not a word
- L I T G E – ""litge"" – not a word
- L I Q G E – ""liqge"" – not a word
- L I U G E – ""liuge"" – not a word
- L I V G E – ""livge"" – not a word

Wait, maybe I missed: ""LIGNE"" – but that's 5 letters, but G is 2, N is 3, but pattern is L I ? G E.

Actually, the only common word fitting L I ? G E is ""L I N G E"" – but that seems non-standard. Let me check dictionary:

Real English 5-letter words with pattern L I ? G E:
- ""LIGNE"" – not standard
- ""LIFER"" – but E is 5, R is excluded
- ""LIGER"" – but G is 2, R is excluded
- ""LIEGE"" – but E is 5, J is allowed, but would be L I E J E – no
- ""LIGE"" is 4 letters

Actually, the only common word fitting is ""L I N G E"" – but it's very obscure. Let me see if any others:

- ""L I P G E"" – no
- ""L I K G E"" – no
- ""L I T G E"" – no

Realizing that ""L I N G E"" is actually the only standard word matching, even though it's obscure. Alternatively, ""L I V G E"" – no.

But wait, let me check ""L I V E R"" – but V is allowed, R is excluded.

Actually, the correct word is ""L I N G E"" – ""lining"" is 6 letters, but ""linge"" is not standard. This suggests I might have made an error.

Re-evaluating: pattern is L I ? G E. Possible letters for position 3: from remaining allowed (F, J, K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z).

Real words:
- ""L I N G E"" – ""linge"" is not standard
- ""L I F G E"" – no
- ""L I P G E"" – no
- ""L I K G E"" – no
- ""L I T G E"" – no
- ""L I Q G E"" – no
- ""L I U G E"" – no
- ""L I V G E"" – no

This suggests the word might be ""L I N G E"" despite being obscure, or I might have missed a letter. Rechecking allowed letters: F, J, K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Realizing ""L I N G E"" is actually the only possible standard word, so I'll proceed with that.

But let me double-check: ""L I N G E"" – ""linge"" is valid in some dictionaries as the plural of ""ling"" (a small fish), but might be too obscure.

Alternative: ""L I P G E"" – no, ""lipge"" is not a word.

Rechecking pattern: L I ? G E. The only valid word seems to be ""linge"".

However, considering ""L I V G E"" – no.

Realizing I might have missed: ""L I Q G E"" – no.

Thus, the most plausible word is ""linge"", despite being less common.

But let me consider if any other letters fit: ""L I N G E"" – N is allowed, G is 4, E is 5.

Therefore, the correct guess is ""LINGE"".

- Positions: _ I _ G E (I in 2, G in 4, E in 5 are locked)
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, S, C, H, M, W, D, B
- L is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4 (from BILGE feedback: L(-) in position 3 means it can’t be 3, and from WIELD feedback: L(-) in position 4 means it can’t be 4). Therefore L must be in position 1.

So the pattern is L I _ G E.

Remaining allowed letters (not yet excluded): F, J, K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching L I _ G E:
- L I G E ? – but we need 5 letters and G is in 4, E in 5.
- L I _ G E: possibilities are L I F G E, L I N G E, L I P G E, etc.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-1 consonants to maximize information gain. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This will help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Another good alternative might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong for a first guess due to its high vowel count and common consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We now know:
- E is in the word and is in the correct (5th) position.
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word is _ _ _ _ E with the letters A, R, O, S excluded.

Good remaining common consonants are T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, F, G, B, etc.
Good remaining common vowels are I, U (since A and O are out).

I want a word that:
1. Ends in E
2. Uses none of A, R, O, S
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Some candidates:
- TIGER → but R is excluded
- UNITY → but U is a vowel, N/T/Y are good
- ELITE → but E is already known at position 5, and L, I, T are good
- CHIME → C, H, I, M, E
- GLIDE → G, L, I, D, E

""CHIME"" looks good because it uses C, H, I, M, E - none of the excluded letters, and covers several new consonants and the vowel I.

<|im_end|>

Current knowledge:
- E is fixed in the 5th position (✓).
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, S, C, H, M.
- Letter I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).

So the pattern is _ _ _ _ E with I somewhere in the first, second, or fourth spots.

Remaining common letters not yet tried:
Consonants: B, D, F, G, K, L, N, P, T, V, W, Y, Z
Vowels: I, U (since A, O are out)

I want a word that:
1. Ends in E
2. Contains I but not in position 3
3. Uses only the allowed letters
4. Uses common letters to maximize info

Possible candidates:
- BIBLE → but B and L are good, and I is in positions 2 and 4 (two I's might be too restrictive)
- DIGIT → but D and G are good, and I is in positions 2 and 4
- FIFTY → but F and T, Y are good, I in position 3 is excluded
- GINSE → but G and N, S is excluded
- NINJA → but N and J, A excluded
- TIGER → but T, I, G, E, R but R excluded
- UNION → but U and N, I in position 3 is excluded
- VIVID → but V and D, I in positions 2 and 4
- WIELD → W, I, E, L, D - good letters, I in position 2

""WIELD"" seems good because:
- Ends with E
- Contains I in position 2 (allowed)
- Uses W, L, D which haven't been tested yet
- Uses common letters

Current knowledge:
- E is fixed in position 5 (✓)

- Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, S, C, H, M, W, D
- Letters still possible: B, F, G, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z
- From the feedback on WIELD, we know:
  – I and E are correct in positions 2 and 5
  – L is in the word but NOT in position 4
  – W and D are not in the word

So the pattern is _ I _ _ E with L somewhere in positions 1, 3 (since it can’t be 4).

Good remaining consonants: B, F, G, K, N, P, T, V, Y
Good remaining vowels: U (since A, O are out and I is used)

I want a word that:
1. Has I in position 2 and E in position 5
2. Contains L in position 1 or 3
3. Uses only the allowed letters

Candidates:
- L I _ _ E: LIQUE, LINGE (but Q and G allowed, N allowed) → but LIQUE uses Q which is okay, but might be less common
- _ I L _ E: B I LGE, F I LME, N I LGE, T I LDE, etc.

Looking for common words:
- ""BILGE"" – B, I, L, G, E – all letters allowed, L in position 3
- ""FILME"" – but ""FILME"" is not a standard word
- ""NILGE"" – not a word
- ""TILDE"" – T, I, L, D, E – but D is excluded
- ""GILTE"" – not a word
- ""PILGE"" – not a word

""BILGE"" seems the only common word fitting the pattern and letter constraints.

Let me check: B, I, L, G, E – none are excluded, and L is in position 3 (allowed).

Now we know:
- The word is L I _ G E (positions 1, 2, 4, 5 locked)
- The only remaining unknown is position 3.
- Letters already eliminated: A, R, O, S, C, H, M, W, D, B, N.
- Allowed letters for position 3: F, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common English 5-letter words that fit L I ? G E:
- L I F G E – not a word
- L I J G E – not a word
- L I K G E – not a word
- L I P G E – not a word
- L I Q G E – not a word
- L I T G E – not a word
- L I U G E – not a word
- L I V G E – not a word
- L I X G E – not a word
- L I Y G E – not a word
- L I Z G E – not a word

The only standard word that fits is L I T G E – but ""litge"" is not valid. This suggests I might have missed an earlier step or the word is very obscure.

Rechecking earlier deductions:
- From BILGE: L(-) in position 3 means L cannot be 3, but can be 1 (confirmed by L(✓) in position 1).
- Pattern is indeed L I ? G E.
- Given the constraints, the only plausible remaining letter is T, forming L I T G E, but this is not a valid word.

Realizing the oversight: The correct word must be L I T G E, but since it's not valid, I must revisit. However, upon deeper reflection, the actual valid word fitting L I ? G E is L I T G E, but as it's invalid, this indicates an error in allowed letters.

Rechecking allowed letters: All letters except those explicitly excluded are allowed. The only remaining valid word is L I T G E, which must be the answer despite initial disbelief.

Thus, the final guess is:
