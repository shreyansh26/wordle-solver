For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these. A good strategy is to use words with common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 4 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions quickly. This should give us good information to narrow down future guesses efficiently.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the correct position (5th spot).
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. The letters A, R, O, S are excluded.
3. The remaining letters to consider are: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good second guess should:
- Keep E in the last position.
- Use new letters we haven't tried yet.
- Cover common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in E, ""UNTIE"" is a strong candidate because:
- It keeps E in the 5th spot.
- Uses new letters U, N, T, I.
- These letters are all common and haven't been tested yet.

This should help us quickly identify which of these new letters are in the word and their correct positions.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

2. untie → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) E(✓)
   - Still E in position 5.
   - U and T are not in the word.
   - N and I are in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 respectively.

So we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T
- Letters that ARE in the word: N, I (but not in positions 3 and 4)
- Pattern: _ _ _ _ E
- N cannot be in position 3, and I cannot be in position 4.

Remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word ending in E that contains both N and I, doesn’t use any excluded letters, and places N and I in allowed positions.

Possible placements:
- N could be in positions 1, 2, 4 (but 4 is excluded for I, so N in 1, 2, or 4)
- I could be in positions 1, 2, 3 (since 4 is excluded)

Let’s try to find a word that satisfies:
- Ends with E
- Contains N and I
- No A, R, O, S, U, T
- N not in position 3, I not in position 4

One candidate is ""INANE"":
- Ends with E
- Contains N and I
- But A is excluded → fails
Next: ""VENUE"":
- Ends with E
- Contains N and U
- But U is excluded → fails
Next: ""PINE"" – too short
Next: ""MINED"":
- Ends with D → fails
Next: ""WINED"":
- Ends with D → fails
Next: ""LINED"":
- Ends with D → fails
Next: ""HINGE"":
- Ends with E
- Contains N and I
- Letters: H, I, N, G, E
- All letters are unused and valid
- Positions: I in 2 (allowed), N in 3 (but N cannot be in 3 → fails)

Close call. Let’s adjust: ""HINGE"" fails because N is in position 3.

Alternative: ""PINE"" – no, too short.
Alternative: ""WINE"" – no N.
Alternative: ""DINGE"" – not a word.
Alternative: ""FINGE"" – not a word.
Alternative: ""BINGE"" – not a word.
Alternative: ""CINGE"" – not a word.
Alternative: ""KINGE"" – archaic, unlikely.
Alternative: ""MINGE"" – not a word.

Let’s try a different approach: ensure N and I are in allowed positions.

N can be in 1, 2, or 4
I can be in 1, 2, or 3

Let’s try N in position 1:
N _ _ _ E, with I in 2 or 3
- N I _ _ E: ""NIECE"" – but E in 5 is already known, and C, E are allowed
- N I C E – but needs 5 letters: ""NICE"" – too short
- N I _ _ E: ""NIDLE"" – but D, L are allowed, and E is 5th
Wait: ""NIDLE"" – but I is in position 2 (allowed), N in 1 (allowed), D and L are new letters.

""NIDLE"":
- N(1) I(2) D(3) L(4) E(5)
- All letters: N, I, D, L, E – none excluded
- Positions: N not in 3 (it's in 1) ✓, I not in 4 (it's in 2) ✓
This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""NIBLE"" – but B is allowed, same pattern
But ""NIDLE"" is more common.

Let me verify ""NIDLE"" is a valid word: yes, it's a variant spelling of ""nidle"" (to snore), though rare.

Better choice: ""WINDY"" – but ends with Y, not E.

Alternative: ""MINCE"":
- M I N C E
- Ends with E
- Contains N and I
- Letters M, I, N, C, E – all allowed
- Positions: I in 2 (allowed), N in 3 (but N cannot be in 3) → fails

Ah, the issue is N in position 3. So we must avoid N in 3.

Let’s try N in position 2:
_ N _ _ E
With I in 1 or 3
- I N _ _ E: ""INSET"" – but T is excluded → fails
- _ N I _ E: ""DINER"":
  - D I N E R – but R is excluded → fails
- ""BINNER"" – too long
- ""CINER"" – too short
- ""GINER"" – not a word
- ""LINER"" – R excluded → fails
- ""MINER"" – R excluded → fails
- ""WINER"" – R excluded → fails

Next: N in position 4:
_ _ _ N E
With I in 1, 2, or 3
- I in 1: I _ _ N E → ""I _ _ N E"" – need 3 letters: ""I"" + 3 letters + ""NE""
  - ""I"" + ""D"" + ""L"" + ""NE"" → ""IDONE"" – but O is excluded → fails
  - ""I"" + ""M"" + ""P"" + ""NE"" → ""IMPNE"" – not a word
  - ""I"" + ""C"" + ""K"" + ""NE"" → ""ICKNE"" – not a word
  - ""I"" + ""G"" + ""H"" + ""NE"" → ""IGHNE"" – not a word
  - ""I"" + ""V"" + ""E"" + ""NE"" – but E is already 5th → ""IVE NE"" – not 5 letters
  - ""I"" + ""S"" + ""T"" + ""NE"" – but S, T excluded → fails
  - ""I"" + ""B"" + ""L"" + ""NE"" → ""IBLNE"" – not a word
  - ""I"" + ""D"" + ""E"" + ""NE"" – but E is already 5th → ""IDE NE"" – not 5 letters
  - ""I"" + ""V"" + ""E"" + ""NE"" – same issue
  - ""I"" + ""M"" + ""E"" + ""NE"" – same issue
  - ""I"" + ""G"" + ""E"" + ""NE"" – same issue
  - ""I"" + ""V"" + ""I"" + ""NE"" – but I is already in 1
  - ""I"" + ""G"" + ""I"" + ""NE"" – same
  - ""I"" + ""M"" + ""I"" + ""NE"" – same
  - ""I"" + ""D"" + ""I"" + ""NE"" – same
  - ""I"" + ""B"" + ""I"" + ""NE"" – same

This path is tricky. Let’s try I in 3:
_ _ I _ E
With N in 1, 2, or 4
- N in 1: N _ I _ E → ""N"" + 2 letters + ""I"" + ""E""
  - ""N"" + ""D"" + ""I"" + ""E"" – but needs 5 letters: ""NDIEE"" – no
  - ""N"" + ""B"" + ""I"" + ""E"" – ""NBIEE"" – no
  - ""N"" + ""G"" + ""I"" + ""E"" – ""NGIEE"" – no
  - ""N"" + ""C"" + ""I"" + ""E"" – ""NCIEE"" – no

  - None of these are valid words.

- N in 4: _ _ _ N E
  - With I in 1, 2, or 3
  - I in 1: I _ _ N E → ""I"" + 2 letters + ""N"" + ""E""
    - ""I"" + ""D"" + ""L"" + ""N"" + ""E"" → ""IDLNE"" – no

    - None of these are valid words.

This is getting tedious. Let’s step back.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing N and I, excluding A,R,O,S,U,T, with N not in 3 and I not in 4.

Let me list possible positions:
- N can be in 1, 2, 4
- I can be in 1, 2, 3

Let’s try N in 1, I in 2:
N I _ _ E → ""N I _ _ E"" – need 3 and 4 letters, not excluded
Possible: N I D L E → ""NIDLE"" – valid word (variant of ""nidle"")

Check letters: N, I, D, L, E – none excluded, positions:
- N in 1 (allowed)
- I in 2 (allowed)
- D and L are new
This seems valid.

Another candidate: N I C K E → but C, K are allowed, but ""NICK E"" is ""NICK"" + E, but ""NICK E"" is not 5 letters
""N I C E"" – too short.

""N I D L E"" is 5 letters and valid.

Thus, ""NIDLE"" is a strong next guess.

But ""NIDLE"" is quite obscure. Let’s try more common word.

Next option: N in 1, I in 3:
N _ I _ E → ""N _ I _ E"" – need 2 and 4 letters
Possible: N D I L E → ""NDILE"" – not a word
N G I L E → ""NGILE"" – not a word
N B I L E → ""NBILE"" – not a word
N M I L E → ""NMILE"" – not a word
N V I L E → ""NVILE"" – not a word
N C I L E → ""NCILE"" – not a word
N F I L E → ""NFILE"" – not a word
N H I L E → ""NHILE"" – not a word
N K I L E → ""NKILE"" – not a word
N P I L E → ""NPILE"" – not a word
N Q I L E → ""NQILE"" – not a word
N W I L E → ""NWILE"" – not a word
N X I L E → ""NXILE"" – not a word
N Y I L E → ""NYILE"" – not a word
N Z I L E → ""NZILE"" – not a word
None of these are valid.

Next option: N in 2, I in 1:
I N _ _ E → ""I N _ _ E"" – need 3 and 4 letters
Possible: I N D L E → ""INDLE"" – not a word
I N G L E → ""INGLE"" – valid word!

Check:
- I N G L E
- Ends with E (position 5) ✓
- Contains N and I ✓
- Letters: I, N, G, L, E – none excluded (A,R,O,S,U,T are excluded, G,L,E are allowed)
- Positions: N in 2 (allowed), I in 1 (allowed)
- ""INGLE"" is a valid word.

This seems like the best path.

Verification:
- Excluded letters: A, R, O, S, U, T
- Used letters: I, N, G, L, E – all allowed
- Positions:
  - I in 1 (allowed)
  - N in 2 (allowed)
  - G in 3 (new)
  - L in 4 (new)
  - E in 5 (fixed)
This should give us information about G and L while confirming I and N positions.

Therefore, the next guess is ""INGLE"".
</think>

Based on the feedback so far, I know:
- The word ends with E (position 5).
- The letters A, R, O, S, U, T are not in the word at all.
- The letters N and I are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

A good next guess should use new letters while keeping E in position 5. The word ""INGLE"" uses I, N, G, L, E and fits all constraints:
- Ends with E.
- Contains N and I.
- Uses new letters G and L.
- Positions N and I in allowed spots.

<guess>ingle</guess>",ingle,"From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

2. untie → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) E(✓)
   - Still E in position 5.
   - U and T are not in the word.
   - N and I are in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 respectively.

So we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T
- Letters that ARE in the word: N, I (but not in positions 3 and 4)
- Pattern: _ _ _ _ E
- N cannot be in position 3, and I cannot be in position 4.

Remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word ending in E that contains both N and I, doesn’t use any excluded letters, and places N and I in allowed positions.

Possible placements:
- N could be in positions 1, 2, 4 (but 4 is excluded for I, so N in 1, 2, or 4)
- I could be in positions 1, 2, 3 (since 4 is excluded)

Let’s try to find a word that satisfies:
- Ends with E
- Contains N and I
- No A, R, O, S, U, T
- N not in position 3, I not in position 4

One candidate is ""INANE"":
- Ends with E
- Contains N and I
- But A is excluded → fails
Next: ""VENUE"":
- Ends with E
- Contains N and U
- But U is excluded → fails
Next: ""PINE"" – too short
Next: ""MINED"":
- Ends with D → fails
Next: ""WINED"":
- Ends with D → fails
Next: ""LINED"":
- Ends with D → fails
Next: ""HINGE"":
- Ends with E
- Contains N and I
- Letters: H, I, N, G, E
- All letters are unused and valid
- Positions: I in 2 (allowed), N in 3 (but N cannot be in 3 → fails)

Close call. Let’s adjust: ""HINGE"" fails because N is in position 3.

Alternative: ""PINE"" – no, too short.
Alternative: ""WINE"" – no N.
Alternative: ""DINGE"" – not a word.
Alternative: ""FINGE"" – not a word.
Alternative: ""BINGE"" – not a word.
Alternative: ""CINGE"" – not a word.
Alternative: ""KINGE"" – archaic, unlikely.
Alternative: ""MINGE"" – not a word.

Let’s try a different approach: ensure N and I are in allowed positions.

N can be in 1, 2, or 4
I can be in 1, 2, or 3

Let’s try N in position 1:
N _ _ _ E, with I in 2 or 3
- N I _ _ E: ""NIECE"" – but E in 5 is already known, and C, E are allowed
- N I C E – but needs 5 letters: ""NICE"" – too short
- N I _ _ E: ""NIDLE"" – but D, L are allowed, and E is 5th
Wait: ""NIDLE"" – but I is in position 2 (allowed), N in 1 (allowed), D and L are new letters.

""NIDLE"":
- N(1) I(2) D(3) L(4) E(5)
- All letters: N, I, D, L, E – none excluded
- Positions: N not in 3 (it's in 1) ✓, I not in 4 (it's in 2) ✓
This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""NIBLE"" – but B is allowed, same pattern
But ""NIDLE"" is more common.

Let me verify ""NIDLE"" is a valid word: yes, it's a variant spelling of ""nidle"" (to snore), though rare.

Better choice: ""WINDY"" – but ends with Y, not E.

Alternative: ""MINCE"":
- M I N C E
- Ends with E
- Contains N and I
- Letters M, I, N, C, E – all allowed
- Positions: I in 2 (allowed), N in 3 (but N cannot be in 3) → fails

Ah, the issue is N in position 3. So we must avoid N in 3.

Let’s try N in position 2:
_ N _ _ E
With I in 1 or 3
- I N _ _ E: ""INSET"" – but T is excluded → fails
- _ N I _ E: ""DINER"":
  - D I N E R – but R is excluded → fails

- ""CINER"" – too short
- ""GINER"" – not a word
- ""LINER"" – R excluded → fails
- ""MINER"" – R excluded → fails
- ""WINER"" – R excluded → fails

Next: N in position 4:
_ _ _ N E
With I in 1, 2, or 3
- I in 1: I _ _ N E → ""I _ _ N E"" – need 3 letters: ""I"" + 3 letters + ""NE""
  - ""I"" + ""D"" + ""L"" + ""NE"" → ""IDONE"" – but O is excluded → fails
  - ""I"" + ""M"" + ""P"" + ""NE"" → ""IMPNE"" – not a word

  - ""I"" + ""G"" + ""H"" + ""NE"" → ""IGHNE"" – not a word
  - ""I"" + ""V"" + ""E"" + ""NE"" – but E is already 5th → ""IVE NE"" – not 5 letters
  - ""I"" + ""S"" + ""T"" + ""NE"" – but S, T excluded → fails
  - ""I"" + ""B"" + ""L"" + ""NE"" → ""IBLNE"" – not a word
  - ""I"" + ""D"" + ""E"" + ""NE"" – but E is already 5th → ""IDE NE"" – not 5 letters
  - ""I"" + ""V"" + ""E"" + ""NE"" – same issue
  - ""I"" + ""M"" + ""E"" + ""NE"" – same issue
  - ""I"" + ""G"" + ""E"" + ""NE"" – same issue
  - ""I"" + ""V"" + ""I"" + ""NE"" – but I is already in 1

  - ""I"" + ""M"" + ""I"" + ""NE"" – same
  - ""I"" + ""D"" + ""I"" + ""NE"" – same

This path is tricky. Let’s try I in 3:

    - None of these are valid words.

This is getting tedious. Let’s step back.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing N and I, excluding A,R,O,S,U,T, with N not in 3 and I not in 4.

Let me list possible positions:

Check letters: N, I, D, L, E – none excluded, positions:
- N in 1 (allowed)

This seems valid.

Another candidate: N I C K E → but C, K are allowed, but ""NICK E"" is ""NICK"" + E, but ""NICK E"" is not 5 letters
""N I C E"" – too short.

""N I D L E"" is 5 letters and valid.

Thus, ""NIDLE"" is a strong next guess.

But ""NIDLE"" is quite obscure. Let’s try more common word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these. A good strategy is to use words with common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 4 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions quickly. This should give us good information to narrow down future guesses efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the correct position (5th spot).
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. The letters A, R, O, S are excluded.
3. The remaining letters to consider are: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good second guess should:
- Keep E in the last position.
- Use new letters we haven't tried yet.
- Cover common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in E, ""UNTIE"" is a strong candidate because:
- It keeps E in the 5th spot.
- Uses new letters U, N, T, I.
- These letters are all common and haven't been tested yet.

This should help us quickly identify which of these new letters are in the word and their correct positions.

    - None of these are valid words.

This is getting tedious. Let’s step back.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing N and I, excluding A,R,O,S,U,T, with N not in 3 and I not in 4.

Let me list possible positions:
- N can be in 1, 2, 4
- I can be in 1, 2, 3

Let’s try N in 1, I in 2:
N I _ _ E → ""N I _ _ E"" – need 3 and 4 letters, not excluded
Possible: N I D L E → ""NIDLE"" – valid word (variant of ""nidle"")

Check letters: N, I, D, L, E – none excluded, positions:
- N in 1 (allowed)
- I in 2 (allowed)
- D and L are new
This seems valid.

Another candidate: N I C K E → but C, K are allowed, but ""NICK E"" is ""NICK"" + E, but ""NICK E"" is not 5 letters
""N I C E"" – too short.

""N I D L E"" is 5 letters and valid.

Thus, ""NIDLE"" is a strong next guess.

But ""NIDLE"" is quite obscure. Let’s try more common word.

Next option: N in 1, I in 3:
N _ I _ E → ""N _ I _ E"" – need 2 and 4 letters
Possible: N D I L E → ""NDILE"" – not a word
N G I L E → ""NGILE"" – not a word
N B I L E → ""NBILE"" – not a word
N M I L E → ""NMILE"" – not a word
N V I L E → ""NVILE"" – not a word
N C I L E → ""NCILE"" – not a word
N F I L E → ""NFILE"" – not a word
N H I L E → ""NHILE"" – not a word
N K I L E → ""NKILE"" – not a word
N P I L E → ""NPILE"" – not a word
N Q I L E → ""NQILE"" – not a word
N W I L E → ""NWILE"" – not a word
N X I L E → ""NXILE"" – not a word
N Y I L E → ""NYILE"" – not a word
N Z I L E → ""NZILE"" – not a word
None of these are valid.

Next option: N in 2, I in 1:
I N _ _ E → ""I N _ _ E"" – need 3 and 4 letters
Possible: I N D L E → ""INDLE"" – not a word
I N G L E → ""INGLE"" – valid word!

Check:
- I N G L E
- Ends with E (position 5) ✓
- Contains N and I ✓
- Letters: I, N, G, L, E – none excluded (A,R,O,S,U,T are excluded, G,L,E are allowed)
- Positions: N in 2 (allowed), I in 1 (allowed)
- ""INGLE"" is a valid word.

This seems like the best path.

Verification:
- Excluded letters: A, R, O, S, U, T
- Used letters: I, N, G, L, E – all allowed
- Positions:
  - I in 1 (allowed)
  - N in 2 (allowed)
  - G in 3 (new)
  - L in 4 (new)
  - E in 5 (fixed)
This should give us information about G and L while confirming I and N positions.

Therefore, the next guess is ""INGLE"".Based on the feedback so far, I know:
- The word ends with E (position 5).
- The letters A, R, O, S, U, T are not in the word at all.
- The letters N and I are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

A good next guess should use new letters while keeping E in position 5. The word ""INGLE"" uses I, N, G, L, E and fits all constraints:
- Ends with E.
- Contains N and I.
- Uses new letters G and L.
- Positions N and I in allowed spots.

- Letters that ARE in the word: I, N (with restricted positions)
- Word pattern: _ _ _ _ E
- Position restrictions:
  - I ≠ positions 1 or 4
  - N ≠ positions 2 or 3

Available letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains both I and N, uses only allowed letters, and respects the position bans.

Possible positions for I: 2 or 3
Possible positions for N: 1 or 4

Let’s list valid patterns:
- If N is in 1: N _ _ _ E
  - I must be in 2 or 3
  - Possible: N I _ _ E or N _ I _ E

- If N is in 4: _ _ _ N E
  - I must be in 2 or 3
  - Possible: _ I _ N E or _ _ I N E

Now let’s find real words that fit these patterns using allowed letters.

1. N I _ _ E
   - N I D L E → but L is excluded
   - N I C H E → C, H, E are allowed; D is allowed
   - N I C H E → valid word ""NICHE""

2. N _ I _ E
   - N D I L E → L excluded
   - N D I G E → G excluded
   - N D I C E → C is allowed, D, I, E are allowed
   - N D I C E → valid word ""NDICE"" but not a real word
   - N B I C E → not a word
   - N F I C E → not a word
   - N H I C E → not a word
   - N M I C E → not a word
   - N V I C E → not a word

   - V I N E → too short
   - W I N E → too short
   - C I N E → no
   - C H I N E → valid word ""CHINE"" (variant spelling of ""chine"")

4. _ _ I N E
   - C C I N E → no
   - B I N E → too short
   - C H I N E → same as above
   - M I N E → too short
   - P I N E → too short
   - V I N E → too short
   - W I N E → too short

Real words found:
- NICHE (N I C H E)
- CHINE (C H I N E)

Both use allowed letters and fit position constraints:
- NICHE: N(1) I(2) C(3) H(4) E(5)
  - N is in position 1 (allowed)
  - I is in position 2 (allowed)
  - C, H, E are allowed

- CHINE: C(1) H(2) I(3) N(4) E(5)
  - I is in position 3 (allowed)
  - N is in position 4 (allowed)
  - C, H, E are allowed

Between these, ""NICHE"" is more common and provides info on C and H, so I'll choose that.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these. A good strategy is to use words with common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 4 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions quickly. This should give us good information to narrow down future guesses efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the correct position (5th spot).
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. The letters A, R, O, S are excluded.
3. The remaining letters to consider are: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good second guess should:
- Keep E in the last position.
- Use new letters we haven't tried yet.
- Cover common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in E, ""UNTIE"" is a strong candidate because:
- It keeps E in the 5th spot.
- Uses new letters U, N, T, I.
- These letters are all common and haven't been tested yet.

This should help us quickly identify which of these new letters are in the word and their correct positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: untie -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

2. untie → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) E(✓)
   - Still E in position 5.
   - U and T are not in the word.
   - N and I are in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 respectively.

So we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T
- Letters that ARE in the word: N, I (but not in positions 3 and 4)
- Pattern: _ _ _ _ E
- N cannot be in position 3, and I cannot be in position 4.

Remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word ending in E that contains both N and I, doesn’t use any excluded letters, and places N and I in allowed positions.

Possible placements:
- N could be in positions 1, 2, 4 (but 4 is excluded for I, so N in 1, 2, or 4)
- I could be in positions 1, 2, 3 (since 4 is excluded)

Let’s try to find a word that satisfies:
- Ends with E
- Contains N and I
- No A, R, O, S, U, T
- N not in position 3, I not in position 4

One candidate is ""INANE"":
- Ends with E
- Contains N and I
- But A is excluded → fails
Next: ""VENUE"":
- Ends with E
- Contains N and U
- But U is excluded → fails
Next: ""PINE"" – too short
Next: ""MINED"":
- Ends with D → fails
Next: ""WINED"":
- Ends with D → fails
Next: ""LINED"":
- Ends with D → fails
Next: ""HINGE"":
- Ends with E
- Contains N and I
- Letters: H, I, N, G, E
- All letters are unused and valid
- Positions: I in 2 (allowed), N in 3 (but N cannot be in 3 → fails)

Close call. Let’s adjust: ""HINGE"" fails because N is in position 3.

Alternative: ""PINE"" – no, too short.
Alternative: ""WINE"" – no N.
Alternative: ""DINGE"" – not a word.
Alternative: ""FINGE"" – not a word.
Alternative: ""BINGE"" – not a word.
Alternative: ""CINGE"" – not a word.
Alternative: ""KINGE"" – archaic, unlikely.
Alternative: ""MINGE"" – not a word.

Let’s try a different approach: ensure N and I are in allowed positions.

N can be in 1, 2, or 4
I can be in 1, 2, or 3

Let’s try N in position 1:
N _ _ _ E, with I in 2 or 3
- N I _ _ E: ""NIECE"" – but E in 5 is already known, and C, E are allowed
- N I C E – but needs 5 letters: ""NICE"" – too short
- N I _ _ E: ""NIDLE"" – but D, L are allowed, and E is 5th
Wait: ""NIDLE"" – but I is in position 2 (allowed), N in 1 (allowed), D and L are new letters.

""NIDLE"":
- N(1) I(2) D(3) L(4) E(5)
- All letters: N, I, D, L, E – none excluded
- Positions: N not in 3 (it's in 1) ✓, I not in 4 (it's in 2) ✓
This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""NIBLE"" – but B is allowed, same pattern
But ""NIDLE"" is more common.

Let me verify ""NIDLE"" is a valid word: yes, it's a variant spelling of ""nidle"" (to snore), though rare.

Better choice: ""WINDY"" – but ends with Y, not E.

Alternative: ""MINCE"":
- M I N C E
- Ends with E
- Contains N and I
- Letters M, I, N, C, E – all allowed
- Positions: I in 2 (allowed), N in 3 (but N cannot be in 3) → fails

Ah, the issue is N in position 3. So we must avoid N in 3.

Let’s try N in position 2:
_ N _ _ E
With I in 1 or 3
- I N _ _ E: ""INSET"" – but T is excluded → fails
- _ N I _ E: ""DINER"":
  - D I N E R – but R is excluded → fails
- ""BINNER"" – too long
- ""CINER"" – too short
- ""GINER"" – not a word
- ""LINER"" – R excluded → fails
- ""MINER"" – R excluded → fails
- ""WINER"" – R excluded → fails

Next: N in position 4:
_ _ _ N E
With I in 1, 2, or 3
- I in 1: I _ _ N E → ""I _ _ N E"" – need 3 letters: ""I"" + 3 letters + ""NE""
  - ""I"" + ""D"" + ""L"" + ""NE"" → ""IDONE"" – but O is excluded → fails
  - ""I"" + ""M"" + ""P"" + ""NE"" → ""IMPNE"" – not a word
  - ""I"" + ""C"" + ""K"" + ""NE"" → ""ICKNE"" – not a word
  - ""I"" + ""G"" + ""H"" + ""NE"" → ""IGHNE"" – not a word
  - ""I"" + ""V"" + ""E"" + ""NE"" – but E is already 5th → ""IVE NE"" – not 5 letters
  - ""I"" + ""S"" + ""T"" + ""NE"" – but S, T excluded → fails
  - ""I"" + ""B"" + ""L"" + ""NE"" → ""IBLNE"" – not a word
  - ""I"" + ""D"" + ""E"" + ""NE"" – but E is already 5th → ""IDE NE"" – not 5 letters
  - ""I"" + ""V"" + ""E"" + ""NE"" – same issue
  - ""I"" + ""M"" + ""E"" + ""NE"" – same issue
  - ""I"" + ""G"" + ""E"" + ""NE"" – same issue
  - ""I"" + ""V"" + ""I"" + ""NE"" – but I is already in 1
  - ""I"" + ""G"" + ""I"" + ""NE"" – same
  - ""I"" + ""M"" + ""I"" + ""NE"" – same
  - ""I"" + ""D"" + ""I"" + ""NE"" – same
  - ""I"" + ""B"" + ""I"" + ""NE"" – same

This path is tricky. Let’s try I in 3:
_ _ I _ E
With N in 1, 2, or 4
- N in 1: N _ I _ E → ""N"" + 2 letters + ""I"" + ""E""
  - ""N"" + ""D"" + ""I"" + ""E"" – but needs 5 letters: ""NDIEE"" – no
  - ""N"" + ""B"" + ""I"" + ""E"" – ""NBIEE"" – no
  - ""N"" + ""G"" + ""I"" + ""E"" – ""NGIEE"" – no
  - ""N"" + ""C"" + ""I"" + ""E"" – ""NCIEE"" – no
  - ""N"" + ""M"" + ""I"" + ""E"" – ""NMIEE"" – no
  - ""N"" + ""V"" + ""I"" + ""E"" – ""NVIEE"" – no

  - ""N"" + ""K"" + ""I"" + ""E"" – ""NKIEE"" – no
  - ""N"" + ""H"" + ""I"" + ""E"" – ""NHIEE"" – no
  - ""N"" + ""B"" + ""I"" + ""E"" – same
  - ""N"" + ""D"" + ""I"" + ""E"" – same
  - ""N"" + ""G"" + ""I"" + ""E"" – same
  - ""N"" + ""C"" + ""I"" + ""E"" – same
  - ""N"" + ""M"" + ""I"" + ""E"" – same
  - ""N"" + ""V"" + ""I"" + ""E"" – same
  - ""N"" + ""L"" + ""I"" + ""E"" – same
  - ""N"" + ""K"" + ""I"" + ""E"" – same
  - ""N"" + ""H"" + ""I"" + ""E"" – same
  - None of these are valid words.

- N in 2: _ N I _ E → "" _ N I _ E""
  - ""B"" + ""N"" + ""I"" + ""D"" + ""E"" → ""BNIDE"" – no
  - ""C"" + ""N"" + ""I"" + ""D"" + ""E"" → ""CNIDE"" – no

  - ""Y"" + ""N"" + ""I"" + ""D"" + ""E"" → ""YNIDE"" – no
  - None of these are valid words.

- N in 4: _ _ _ N E
  - With I in 1, 2, or 3
  - I in 1: I _ _ N E → ""I"" + 2 letters + ""N"" + ""E""
    - ""I"" + ""D"" + ""L"" + ""N"" + ""E"" → ""IDLNE"" – no
    - ""I"" + ""D"" + ""G"" + ""N"" + ""E"" → ""IDGNE"" – no

    - ""I"" + ""D"" + ""R"" + ""N"" + ""E"" → ""IDRNE"" – no
    - ""I"" + ""D"" + ""T"" + ""N"" + ""E"" → ""IDTNE"" – no
    - None of these are valid words.

This is getting tedious. Let’s step back.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing N and I, excluding A,R,O,S,U,T, with N not in 3 and I not in 4.

Let me list possible positions:
- N can be in 1, 2, 4
- I can be in 1, 2, 3

Let’s try N in 1, I in 2:
N I _ _ E → ""N I _ _ E"" – need 3 and 4 letters, not excluded
Possible: N I D L E → ""NIDLE"" – valid word (variant of ""nidle"")

Check letters: N, I, D, L, E – none excluded, positions:
- N in 1 (allowed)
- I in 2 (allowed)
- D and L are new
This seems valid.

Another candidate: N I C K E → but C, K are allowed, but ""NICK E"" is ""NICK"" + E, but ""NICK E"" is not 5 letters
""N I C E"" – too short.

""N I D L E"" is 5 letters and valid.

Thus, ""NIDLE"" is a strong next guess.

But ""NIDLE"" is quite obscure. Let’s try more common word.

Next option: N in 1, I in 3:
N _ I _ E → ""N _ I _ E"" – need 2 and 4 letters
Possible: N D I L E → ""NDILE"" – not a word
N G I L E → ""NGILE"" – not a word
N B I L E → ""NBILE"" – not a word
N M I L E → ""NMILE"" – not a word
N V I L E → ""NVILE"" – not a word
N C I L E → ""NCILE"" – not a word
N F I L E → ""NFILE"" – not a word
N H I L E → ""NHILE"" – not a word
N K I L E → ""NKILE"" – not a word
N P I L E → ""NPILE"" – not a word
N Q I L E → ""NQILE"" – not a word
N W I L E → ""NWILE"" – not a word
N X I L E → ""NXILE"" – not a word
N Y I L E → ""NYILE"" – not a word
N Z I L E → ""NZILE"" – not a word
None of these are valid.

Next option: N in 2, I in 1:
I N _ _ E → ""I N _ _ E"" – need 3 and 4 letters
Possible: I N D L E → ""INDLE"" – not a word
I N G L E → ""INGLE"" – valid word!

Check:
- I N G L E
- Ends with E (position 5) ✓
- Contains N and I ✓
- Letters: I, N, G, L, E – none excluded (A,R,O,S,U,T are excluded, G,L,E are allowed)
- Positions: N in 2 (allowed), I in 1 (allowed)
- ""INGLE"" is a valid word.

This seems like the best path.

Verification:
- Excluded letters: A, R, O, S, U, T
- Used letters: I, N, G, L, E – all allowed
- Positions:
  - I in 1 (allowed)
  - N in 2 (allowed)
  - G in 3 (new)
  - L in 4 (new)
  - E in 5 (fixed)
This should give us information about G and L while confirming I and N positions.

Therefore, the next guess is ""INGLE"".Based on the feedback so far, I know:
- The word ends with E (position 5).
- The letters A, R, O, S, U, T are not in the word at all.
- The letters N and I are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

A good next guess should use new letters while keeping E in position 5. The word ""INGLE"" uses I, N, G, L, E and fits all constraints:
- Ends with E.
- Contains N and I.
- Uses new letters G and L.
- Positions N and I in allowed spots.

- Letters that ARE in the word: I, N (with restricted positions)

Available letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains both I and N, uses only allowed letters, and respects the position bans.

Possible positions for I: 2 or 3
Possible positions for N: 1 or 4

Let’s list valid patterns:

  - I must be in 2 or 3
  - Possible: N I _ _ E or N _ I _ E

- If N is in 4: _ _ _ N E
  - I must be in 2 or 3
  - Possible: _ I _ N E or _ _ I N E

Now let’s find real words that fit these patterns using allowed letters.

1. N I _ _ E
   - N I D L E → but L is excluded
   - N I C H E → C, H, E are allowed; D is allowed
   - N I C H E → valid word ""NICHE""

2. N _ I _ E
   - N D I L E → L excluded
   - N D I G E → G excluded
   - N D I C E → C is allowed, D, I, E are allowed
   - N D I C E → valid word ""NDICE"" but not a real word
   - N B I C E → not a word
   - N F I C E → not a word
   - N H I C E → not a word
   - N M I C E → not a word
   - N V I C E → not a word

3. _ I _ N E
   - C I N E → too short
   - B I N E → too short
   - D I N E → too short
   - H I N E → too short
   - M I N E → too short
   - P I N E → too short
   - V I N E → too short
   - W I N E → too short
   - C I N E → no
   - C H I N E → valid word ""CHINE"" (variant spelling of ""chine"")

4. _ _ I N E
   - C C I N E → no
   - B I N E → too short
   - C H I N E → same as above
   - M I N E → too short
   - P I N E → too short
   - V I N E → too short
   - W I N E → too short

Real words found:
- NICHE (N I C H E)
- CHINE (C H I N E)

Both use allowed letters and fit position constraints:
- NICHE: N(1) I(2) C(3) H(4) E(5)
  - N is in position 1 (allowed)
  - I is in position 2 (allowed)
  - C, H, E are allowed

- CHINE: C(1) H(2) I(3) N(4) E(5)
  - I is in position 3 (allowed)
  - N is in position 4 (allowed)
  - C, H, E are allowed

Between these, ""NICHE"" is more common and provides info on C and H, so I'll choose that.

From the four rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - A, R, O, S are out.

2. untie → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) E(✓)
   - U, T are out.
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

3. ingle → I(-) N(-) G(x) L(x) E(✓)
   - G, L are out.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 2.

4. niche → N(-) I(-) C(x) H(-) E(✓)
   - C is out.
   - H is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 2.

Summary of what we know:
- Word ends with E (position 5).
- Letters definitely in: I, N, H.
- Letters definitely out: A, R, O, S, U, T, G, L, C.
- Position restrictions:
  - I cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from ingle and niche).
  - I cannot be in position 4 (from untie).
  - So I must be in position 3.
  - N cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from niche, ingle, untie).
  - So N must be in position 4.
  - H cannot be in position 4 (from niche).
  - So H must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
    - But position 3 is taken by I.
    - So H must be in position 1 or 2.

Current pattern:
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: E
- Positions 1 and 2: to be filled by H and another allowed letter (from remaining letters: B, D, F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Also, H must be in position 1 or 2.

So two possible patterns:
1. H _ I N E
2. _ H I N E

Let's look for real words in these patterns using allowed letters.

1. H _ I N E
   - H D I N E → ""HIDNE"" – not a word
   - H B I N E → ""HIBIN"" – no
   - H F I N E → ""HIFIN"" – no
   - H K I N E → ""HIKIN"" – no
   - H M I N E → ""HIMIN"" – no
   - H P I N E → ""HIPIN"" – no
   - H V I N E → ""HIVIN"" – no
   - H W I N E → ""HIWIN"" – no
   - H J I N E → ""HIJIN"" – no
   - H Q I N E → ""HIQIN"" – no
   - H X I N E → ""HI Xin"" – no
   - H Y I N E → ""HIYIN"" – no
   - H Z I N E → ""HIZIN"" – no

2. _ H I N E
   - B H I N E → ""BHINE"" – no
   - D H I N E → ""DHINE"" – no
   - F H I N E → ""FHINE"" – no
   - J H I N E → ""JHINE"" – no
   - K H I N E → ""KHINE"" – no
   - M H I N E → ""MHINE"" – no
   - P H I N E → ""PHINE"" – no
   - V H I N E → ""VHINE"" – no
   - W H I N E → ""WHINE"" – this is a valid word!

So the only valid word found is ""WHINE"":
- W (allowed), H (must be in position 1 or 2), I (position 3), N (position 4), E (position 5).
- All letters are allowed and positions satisfy all constraints.

<guess>whine</guess>",whine,"From the four rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - A, R, O, S are out.

2. untie → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) E(✓)
   - U, T are out.
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

3. ingle → I(-) N(-) G(x) L(x) E(✓)
   - G, L are out.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 2.

4. niche → N(-) I(-) C(x) H(-) E(✓)
   - C is out.
   - H is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 2.

Summary of what we know:
- Word ends with E (position 5).
- Letters definitely in: I, N, H.
- Letters definitely out: A, R, O, S, U, T, G, L, C.
- Position restrictions:
  - I cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from ingle and niche).
  - I cannot be in position 4 (from untie).
  - So I must be in position 3.
  - N cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from niche, ingle, untie).
  - So N must be in position 4.
  - H cannot be in position 4 (from niche).
  - So H must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
    - But position 3 is taken by I.
    - So H must be in position 1 or 2.

Current pattern:
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: E
- Positions 1 and 2: to be filled by H and another allowed letter (from remaining letters: B, D, F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Also, H must be in position 1 or 2.

So two possible patterns:
1. H _ I N E
2. _ H I N E

Let's look for real words in these patterns using allowed letters.

1. H _ I N E
   - H D I N E → ""HIDNE"" – not a word
   - H B I N E → ""HIBIN"" – no
   - H F I N E → ""HIFIN"" – no
   - H K I N E → ""HIKIN"" – no
   - H M I N E → ""HIMIN"" – no
   - H P I N E → ""HIPIN"" – no
   - H V I N E → ""HIVIN"" – no
   - H W I N E → ""HIWIN"" – no
   - H J I N E → ""HIJIN"" – no
   - H Q I N E → ""HIQIN"" – no
   - H X I N E → ""HI Xin"" – no
   - H Y I N E → ""HIYIN"" – no
   - H Z I N E → ""HIZIN"" – no

2. _ H I N E
   - B H I N E → ""BHINE"" – no
   - D H I N E → ""DHINE"" – no
   - F H I N E → ""FHINE"" – no
   - J H I N E → ""JHINE"" – no
   - K H I N E → ""KHINE"" – no
   - M H I N E → ""MHINE"" – no
   - P H I N E → ""PHINE"" – no
   - V H I N E → ""VHINE"" – no
   - W H I N E → ""WHINE"" – this is a valid word!

So the only valid word found is ""WHINE"":
- W (allowed), H (must be in position 1 or 2), I (position 3), N (position 4), E (position 5).
- All letters are allowed and positions satisfy all constraints.",Guess 5: whine -> FEEDBACK: W(✓) H(✓) I(✓) N(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
