For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One of the classic and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it includes A, R, O, S, and E - five of the most common letters. This gives us a high chance of identifying which of these letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(✓): R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter).
- O(x): O is NOT in the word.
- S(x): S is NOT in the word.
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Contains the letter A somewhere other than position 1
- Does NOT contain O, S

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in position 2
2. Has E in position 5
3. Has A somewhere (positions 3, 4, or 5 - but 5 is E, so positions 3 or 4)
4. No O or S
5. No repeated letters (since A is already present once and positions 3/4 are open)

Possible words could use remaining common letters like T, N, L, C, D, etc. A good candidate is ""GRATE"" - it has R in position 2, E in position 5, A in position 3, and no O or S. Also, G and T are common letters that haven't been tested yet.
