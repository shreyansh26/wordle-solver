2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-1 consonants to quickly identify which vowels are present. One of the most effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a high chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).

- O(x) → O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 5).

So we know:
- Letters present: A, R, E (but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively)
- Letters absent: O, S

We need a 5-letter word that contains A, R, E and avoids O, S. Also:
- A cannot be in position 1
- R cannot be in position 2

A good next guess should place these known letters in new positions while introducing new common consonants to test. The word ""REACT"" comes to mind:
- Contains R, E, A
- Adds C and T (common letters not yet tested)

  - R in position 1 (new position for R, since R was not in position 2)

Let's digest the new feedback on REACT:

R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 1  
E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 2  
A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3  
C(x) – C is NOT in the word  
T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 5  

Summary of what we know so far:
Letters that ARE in the word: A, R, E, T  
Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S, C  

And we have positional constraints:
- A ≠ positions 1, 3  
- R ≠ positions 1, 2  
- E ≠ positions 2, 5  
- T ≠ position 5  

We still need to place these four letters (A, R, E, T) plus one more letter we haven't identified yet (must be a consonant, and cannot be O, S, C).  
Common remaining consonants we could test: N, L, D, G, M, B, etc.

A good candidate word should:
1. Use A, R, E, T in new positions that satisfy the constraints.
2. Introduce a fresh, common consonant.

The word “TREAD” satisfies:
- Contains T, R, E, A, D  
- D is a new letter to test  
- Positions:
  – T in 1 (allowed; wasn’t tested here before)  
  – R in 2 (allowed; only excluded from 1 and 2? No, R is excluded from 1 and 2 both from AROSE and REACT feedback. So R cannot be in 2. Therefore TREAD is invalid.)

Oops, let’s fix that. R cannot be in 2.

Try “TRADE”:
- T, R, A, D, E  
- D is new  
- R in 2 – still invalid.

Try “TAPER”:
- T, A, P, E, R  
- P is new  
- Positions:
  – T in 1 (allowed)  
  – A in 2 (allowed)  
  – P in 3 (new)  
  – E in 4 (allowed)  
  – R in 5 (allowed)  

This obeys all constraints:
- A not in 1 or 3 → it’s in 2 ✓  
- R not in 1 or 2 → it’s in 5 ✓  
- E not in 2 or 5 → it’s in 4 ✓  
- T not in 5 → it’s in 1 ✓  
- Introduces P (new consonant) ✓

So “TAPER” is a solid next guess.
