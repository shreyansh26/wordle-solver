For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. 

Common starting words include:
- SLATE: covers S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: covers C, R, A, N, E
- ADIEU: covers many vowels
- RAISE: covers R, A, I, S, E

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because:
1. R and S are very common consonants in English words
2. A and I are common vowels
3. E is the most common letter in English
4. It avoids less common letters like Q, X, Z

This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

All five letters from RAISE (R, A, I, S, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That immediately eliminates any word containing R, A, I, S, or E.  
We need a 5-letter word that uses entirely different letters.

Common high-value starting words that avoid these letters include:
- TONIC (T, O, N, I, C) – but I is already ruled out.  
- CRONY (C, R, O, N, Y) – R is ruled out.  
- DITTO (D, I, T, T, O) – I and T are candidates, but I is ruled out.  
- MOUTH (M, O, U, T, H) – contains no ruled-out letters.  
- CLOUD (C, L, O, U, D) – also valid.

""MOUTH"" is attractive because:
- It contains four consonants (M, T, H) and one vowel (O, U).  
- None of M, O, U, T, H have been tested yet.  
- It can quickly reveal whether any of these common letters are present.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. 

Common starting words include:
- SLATE: covers S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: covers C, R, A, N, E
- ADIEU: covers many vowels
- RAISE: covers R, A, I, S, E

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because:
1. R and S are very common consonants in English words
2. A and I are common vowels
3. E is the most common letter in English
4. It avoids less common letters like Q, X, Z

This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters from RAISE (R, A, I, S, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That immediately eliminates any word containing R, A, I, S, or E.  
We need a 5-letter word that uses entirely different letters.

Common high-value starting words that avoid these letters include:
- TONIC (T, O, N, I, C) – but I is already ruled out.  
- CRONY (C, R, O, N, Y) – R is ruled out.  
- DITTO (D, I, T, T, O) – I and T are candidates, but I is ruled out.  
- MOUTH (M, O, U, T, H) – contains no ruled-out letters.  
- CLOUD (C, L, O, U, D) – also valid.

""MOUTH"" is attractive because:
- It contains four consonants (M, T, H) and one vowel (O, U).  
- None of M, O, U, T, H have been tested yet.  
- It can quickly reveal whether any of these common letters are present.

Let’s go with MOUTH.

So far every letter we have tried is either “x” (not in the word) or “-” (in the word but in the wrong spot).  
Letters already ruled out: R, A, I, S, E, M, O, T, H.  
The only letter we know is in the word, but not in the position guessed in MOUTH, is U.

Since U came back “-”, it must appear somewhere else in the word (not in position 3).  
We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter U (because it’s the only “-” so far).
2. Does NOT contain any of the letters already marked “x”: R, A, I, S, E, M, O, T, H.
3. Has U in a different position than position 3 (because in MOUTH, U was in position 3 and marked “-”, meaning it’s in the word but not in position 3).

Available letters (excluding the ruled-out set) include:  
B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the known letter U.

We’re looking for a valid 5-letter English word that fits these constraints.  
One simple choice is “BUNNY”:
- Contains U (and two N’s).  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.  
- Puts U in position 2 (different from position 3 in MOUTH).

Another candidate could be “FUNNY” or “JUNNY”, but “BUNNY” is more common.

Let’s carefully update what we now know.

Letters ruled out (all marked “x”):  
R, A, I, S, E, M, O, T, H, B, D

Letters confirmed present (either ✓ or - in earlier guesses):  
U, N, Y

Exact position constraints so far:
- U must be in position 2 (✓ in BUNNY and DUNNY).  
- N must be in position 3 (✓ in BUNNY and DUNNY).  
- Y must be in position 5 (✓ in BUNNY and DUNNY).

So the word structure is fixed as:  
_ U N _ Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has U in position 2  
2. Has N in position 3  
3. Has Y in position 5  
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (i.e., not in {R,A,I,S,E,M,O,T,H,B,D})

Remaining available letters: C, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We must fill positions 1 and 4 with two distinct letters from the remaining set.  
Possible first letters: C, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Possible fourth letters: same set, excluding the first letter.

Let’s list valid English words that fit _ U N _ Y with only allowed letters:

- FUNNY – but F is allowed, N is already placed, Y is correct. However, FUNNY uses N twice, but we already have N in position 3. This would place N in position 4, which is allowed since N is confirmed in the word. But we need to check if N is allowed to appear twice. The feedback so far only confirms N is in position 3, but does not preclude another N. However, in Guess 3 BUNNY, N appeared in position 3 and was marked ✓, so another N in position 4 is possible. But let’s see if there’s a better option.

- JUNNY – J is allowed, N in 3, Y in 5. But JUNNY is not a standard English word.

- LUNNY – L is allowed, but LUNNY is not standard.

- PUNNY – P is allowed, but PUNNY is not standard.

- QUINY – Q is allowed, but this uses I, which is ruled out.

- VUNNY – V is allowed, but VUNNY is not standard.

- WUNNY – W is allowed, but WUNNY is not standard.

- XUNNY – X is allowed, but XUNNY is not standard.

- ZUNNY – Z is allowed, but ZUNNY is not standard.

Let’s try a fresh approach: look for standard English words _ U N _ Y with allowed letters.

- CUNY – too short.

- FUNNY – as noted, uses N in 4, which is allowed, and is a valid word.

<guess>FUNNY</guess>",FUNNY,"Let’s carefully update what we now know.

Letters ruled out (all marked “x”):  
R, A, I, S, E, M, O, T, H, B, D

Letters confirmed present (either ✓ or - in earlier guesses):  
U, N, Y

Exact position constraints so far:
- U must be in position 2 (✓ in BUNNY and DUNNY).  
- N must be in position 3 (✓ in BUNNY and DUNNY).  
- Y must be in position 5 (✓ in BUNNY and DUNNY).

So the word structure is fixed as:  
_ U N _ Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has U in position 2  
2. Has N in position 3  
3. Has Y in position 5  
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (i.e., not in {R,A,I,S,E,M,O,T,H,B,D})

Remaining available letters: C, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We must fill positions 1 and 4 with two distinct letters from the remaining set.  
Possible first letters: C, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Possible fourth letters: same set, excluding the first letter.

Let’s list valid English words that fit _ U N _ Y with only allowed letters:

- FUNNY – but F is allowed, N is already placed, Y is correct. However, FUNNY uses N twice, but we already have N in position 3. This would place N in position 4, which is allowed since N is confirmed in the word. But we need to check if N is allowed to appear twice. The feedback so far only confirms N is in position 3, but does not preclude another N. However, in Guess 3 BUNNY, N appeared in position 3 and was marked ✓, so another N in position 4 is possible. But let’s see if there’s a better option.

- JUNNY – J is allowed, N in 3, Y in 5. But JUNNY is not a standard English word.

- LUNNY – L is allowed, but LUNNY is not standard.

- PUNNY – P is allowed, but PUNNY is not standard.

- QUINY – Q is allowed, but this uses I, which is ruled out.

- VUNNY – V is allowed, but VUNNY is not standard.

- WUNNY – W is allowed, but WUNNY is not standard.

- XUNNY – X is allowed, but XUNNY is not standard.

- ZUNNY – Z is allowed, but ZUNNY is not standard.

Let’s try a fresh approach: look for standard English words _ U N _ Y with allowed letters.

- CUNY – too short.

- FUNNY – as noted, uses N in 4, which is allowed, and is a valid word.

- RUNNY – R is ruled out.

- SUNNY – S is ruled out.

- FUNNY is the only standard word that fits. Even though it repeats N, it is a valid 5-letter word and uses allowed letters. Let’s go with FUNNY.",Guess 5: FUNNY -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) U(✓) N(✓) N(-) Y(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. 

Common starting words include:
- SLATE: covers S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: covers C, R, A, N, E
- ADIEU: covers many vowels
- RAISE: covers R, A, I, S, E

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because:
1. R and S are very common consonants in English words
2. A and I are common vowels
3. E is the most common letter in English
4. It avoids less common letters like Q, X, Z

This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters from RAISE (R, A, I, S, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That immediately eliminates any word containing R, A, I, S, or E.  
We need a 5-letter word that uses entirely different letters.

Common high-value starting words that avoid these letters include:
- TONIC (T, O, N, I, C) – but I is already ruled out.  
- CRONY (C, R, O, N, Y) – R is ruled out.  
- DITTO (D, I, T, T, O) – I and T are candidates, but I is ruled out.  
- MOUTH (M, O, U, T, H) – contains no ruled-out letters.  
- CLOUD (C, L, O, U, D) – also valid.

""MOUTH"" is attractive because:
- It contains four consonants (M, T, H) and one vowel (O, U).  
- None of M, O, U, T, H have been tested yet.  
- It can quickly reveal whether any of these common letters are present.

Let’s go with MOUTH.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
So far every letter we have tried is either “x” (not in the word) or “-” (in the word but in the wrong spot).  
Letters already ruled out: R, A, I, S, E, M, O, T, H.  
The only letter we know is in the word, but not in the position guessed in MOUTH, is U.

Since U came back “-”, it must appear somewhere else in the word (not in position 3).  
We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter U (because it’s the only “-” so far).
2. Does NOT contain any of the letters already marked “x”: R, A, I, S, E, M, O, T, H.
3. Has U in a different position than position 3 (because in MOUTH, U was in position 3 and marked “-”, meaning it’s in the word but not in position 3).

Available letters (excluding the ruled-out set) include:  
B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the known letter U.

We’re looking for a valid 5-letter English word that fits these constraints.  
One simple choice is “BUNNY”:
- Contains U (and two N’s).  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.  
- Puts U in position 2 (different from position 3 in MOUTH).

Another candidate could be “FUNNY” or “JUNNY”, but “BUNNY” is more common.  
Let’s go with BUNNY to test U in position 2 and gather info on N and B.

Let’s digest the new feedback.

Letters still ruled out (all marked “x”):  
R, A, I, S, E, M, O, T, H, B

Letters confirmed present (either correct position or wrong position so far):  
U (must be in the word)  
N (must be in the word)  
Y (must be in the word)

Positions we now know:
- U is NOT in position 2 (because in BUNNY it was marked ✓ in position 2, so it is in position 2).  
- N is NOT in position 3 (because in BUNNY it was marked ✓ in position 3, so it is in position 3).  
- Y is NOT in position 5 (because in BUNNY it was marked ✓ in position 5, so it is in position 5).

Therefore the word must be of the form:
_ _ _ N _ with N in position 3, and U in position 2, and Y in position 5.

So the pattern is: _ U N _ Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has U in position 2  
2. Has N in position 3  
3. Has Y in position 5  
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so letters not in {R,A,I,S,E,M,O,T,H,B})

Available letters: C, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We’re looking for a word that fits _ U N _ Y.  
Possible first letters: C, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Possible fourth letters: same set, excluding the first letter.

Let’s list a few possibilities:
- CUNCY – not a valid word  
- DUNNY – uses N twice, but N is already required once; also Y is in position 5, so DUNNY would be D U N N Y – but N is already in position 3, so this would have N in position 4, which is allowed. However, DUNNY is a valid word.  
- FUNKY – uses K, but K is allowed.  
- GUNKY – uses K.  
- LUNKY – uses K.  
- PUNKY – uses K.

Among these, “DUNNY” seems like the most straightforward word that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters. It also reuses N (which is allowed since N is confirmed in the word). Let’s go with DUNNY.

- Position 4 must be a letter that is NOT yet ruled out and is NOT N (because N is already confirmed in position 3 and cannot appear twice; the feedback for FUNNY shows N in position 4 as “-”, meaning N is not in position 4, so it must be the second N in position 4 of FUNNY that is invalid).

Letters still allowed (not ruled out yet): C, G, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter English word that matches F U N _ Y with one of these letters in position 4.

Valid dictionary words that fit:
- F U N C Y → FUNCY (valid adjective meaning “fun-loving”)
- F U N G Y → FUNGY (valid adjective meaning “fungus-like”)
- F U N K Y → FUNKY (valid slang adjective)
- F U N L Y → FUNLY (not a standard word)
- F U N P Y → FUNPY (not a standard word)
- F U N V Y → FUNVY (not a standard word)
- F U N W Y → FUNWY (not a standard word)
- F U N X Y → FUNXY (not a standard word)
- F U N Z Y → FUNZY (valid adjective)

Among these, FUNCY and FUNZY are both standard, while FUNGY and FUNKY are less common. FUNCY is the most straightforward common word.
