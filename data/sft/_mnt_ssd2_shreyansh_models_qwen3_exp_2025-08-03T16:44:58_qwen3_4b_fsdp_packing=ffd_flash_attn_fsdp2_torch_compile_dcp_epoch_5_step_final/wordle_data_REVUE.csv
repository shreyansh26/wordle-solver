### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Avoids repeating letters to test more possibilities
3. Contains vowels to help identify vowel positions

A great starting word should have a mix of common consonants and vowels. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E) to test vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, maximizing tested letters

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

1. R is fixed in the first spot.
2. E must appear somewhere, but it is NOT in position 5 (from RAISE) and NOT in position 4 (from RODEO). So E must be in position 2 or 3.
3. Letters definitely absent: A, I, S, O, D.

We need a word that:
- Starts with R
- Contains E in position 2 or 3
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (i.e., not A, I, S, O, D)
- Uses fresh letters to gain new information

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, K, M, G, H, B, F, etc.
Good remaining vowels: U (since A, I, O are out)

Let’s try placing E in position 2 and build a word with new letters:
R _ E _ _

Candidate endings: “RENTS” (invalid – T and S are new but S is already ruled out),
“REBEL” (B and L are new),
“RECK” (needs a fifth letter).

A valid word with fresh letters is “REBEL”:
- R in 1 ✓
- E in 2 (new position) ✓
- B, E, L all new letters (E is already known to be in word, but this tests B and L)
- No eliminated letters

So “REBEL” seems optimal.

Let's consolidate what we now know:

1. R is fixed in position 1.
2. E must appear exactly once (since only one “E” has been marked ✓ so far) and it must be in position 2 (because positions 3, 4, 5 have been ruled out).
3. Letters definitely absent: A, I, S, O, D, B, L.

So the pattern is:
R E _ _ _

We need three more letters, each of which:
- is not any of A, I, S, O, D, B, L
- has not yet been tested

Common remaining consonants: T, N, C, K, M, G, H, F, P, Y, W, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (every other vowel has been eliminated).

We want a word that fits R E _ _ _ using only the allowed letters. Some possibilities:
- R E T U _
- R E N T _
- R E C T _
- R E M U _
- R E G A _  (but A is out)
- R E G U _
- R E M U _

A valid 5-letter word that fits is “RENTY” (though “Y” is uncommon as a vowel here). A more common word is “RENTS”, but S is already ruled out. Another valid word is “RECTY” but that’s not common. The most straightforward common word is “RENTS” (invalid due to S). 

Wait, let’s check again:
- R E N T Y – valid word, uses new letters N, T, Y
- R E N U _ – “RENU_” doesn’t form a word
- R E C T Y – “RECTY” isn’t a word
- R E M U _ – “REMUS” but S is out

Actually, the simplest valid common word left is “RENTY”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Avoids repeating letters to test more possibilities
3. Contains vowels to help identify vowel positions

A great starting word should have a mix of common consonants and vowels. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E) to test vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, maximizing tested letters

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word and in the correct first position (✓)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (–) – it is NOT in the 5th spot
- A, I, S are not in the word at all (x)

So far we know:
1. Word starts with R
2. Word contains E somewhere, but not at the end
3. Letters NOT in the word: A, I, S

I want a second guess that:
- Keeps R in the first spot
- Moves E to a new position (positions 2, 3, or 4)
- Uses new common consonants and vowels not yet tested
- Avoids A, I, S entirely

Good letters to test next: T, N, L, C, K, O, U, D, M, etc.

Possible candidates: RODEO, RUTTE (invalid – two T’s), RENAL (contains A), ROLLE (contains L and O), RUDGE, etc.

I’ll pick RODEO because:
- R stays in spot 1
- O and D are new letters
- E is moved to spot 4
- Contains a second vowel (O) to test

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we know:

1. R is fixed in the first spot.
2. E must appear somewhere, but it is NOT in position 5 (from RAISE) and NOT in position 4 (from RODEO). So E must be in position 2 or 3.
3. Letters definitely absent: A, I, S, O, D.

We need a word that:
- Starts with R
- Contains E in position 2 or 3
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (i.e., not A, I, S, O, D)
- Uses fresh letters to gain new information

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, K, M, G, H, B, F, etc.
Good remaining vowels: U (since A, I, O are out)

Let’s try placing E in position 2 and build a word with new letters:
R _ E _ _

Candidate endings: “RENTS” (invalid – T and S are new but S is already ruled out),
“REBEL” (B and L are new),
“RECK” (needs a fifth letter).

A valid word with fresh letters is “REBEL”:
- R in 1 ✓
- E in 2 (new position) ✓
- B, E, L all new letters (E is already known to be in word, but this tests B and L)
- No eliminated letters

So “REBEL” seems optimal.

- Remaining unused letters (and not yet eliminated): C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W, etc.

Among these, the most common consonants left are C, F, G, H, K, M, P.

We need two more letters to fill R E _ _ _ using only the allowed set. Let’s look for common 5-letter words that fit:

Possible endings with allowed letters:
- C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U

Some candidates:
- R E C _ _  → “RECUM” (invalid)
- R E C _ _  → “RECKS” (invalid, S is out)
- R E C _ _  → “RECK” (needs 5 letters)
- R E C U _  → “RECU_” doesn’t form a word
- R E C H _  → “RECH_” doesn’t form a word
- R E M _ _  → “REM_ _” but L is out, and we already ruled out N, T, Y
- R E M _ _  → “REMUS” (invalid, S is out)

- R E C U P  → “RE Cup” (invalid)
- R E C U P  → “RECU P” (invalid)
- R E C U P  → “RECUP” (invalid)

Wait, let’s list all possible combinations of two allowed letters:

Allowed letters: C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W

Possible endings:
- C F → “RECF_” (invalid)
- C G → “RECG_” (invalid)
- C H → “RECH_” (invalid)
- C K → “RECK_” (invalid)
- C M → “RECM_” (invalid)

- M W → “REM W” (invalid)
- P U → “REP U” (invalid)
- P W → “REP W” (invalid)
- U W → “REU W” (invalid)

Hmm, none of these combinations seem to form valid English words. Let’s step back.

We need a valid 5-letter word starting with RE, using only letters not yet eliminated. Let’s list all such words:

Looking at a dictionary, valid words starting with RE using allowed letters:

- REACH – A is out
- REACT – A, C, T are allowed, but T is out
- REBID – B, I, D are out
- RECUT – C, U are allowed, but T is out
- REDEY – D, Y are out
- REFER – F is allowed, but second R is allowed? Wait, we haven’t ruled out R twice. Actually, we don’t have info about double letters, but we have no reason to exclude it. However, we have no evidence against it yet.

Wait, let’s check: we have no info that R appears more than once, so it’s safe to assume single R for now.

- REGMA – A, M are allowed, but A is out
- RELIC – L, I, C – L and I are out
- REMIT – M, I, T – M is allowed, but I and T are out
- REPAY – A, Y are out
- RESUM – S, U, M – S is out
- RETIE – T, I, E – T and I are out
- REUSE – U, S – S is out
- REWED – W, E, D – D is out
- REWEL – L is out
- REWED – D is out
- REWEE – E is already placed
- REWER – W, E, R – seems valid, but let’s check letters: W, E, R are allowed (W not yet tested, E is correct, R is correct). However, we have no info about W yet.

But “WERER” isn’t a word. “REWED” is valid but D is out. “REWER” isn’t valid.

Another candidate: “REPEM” – not a word.

Wait, let’s list all valid English words starting with RE and see which fit our allowed letters:

Valid words starting with RE (from dictionary):
- REACH – A out
- REACT – A, T out
- REBARK – B, A, R, K – B, A out
- REBAR – B, A out
- REBID – B, I, D out
- REBUT – B, U, T – B out
- RECALL – C, A, L – A, L out
- RECK – too short
- RECKON – C, O, N – O, N out
- RECUT – C, U allowed, but T out
- REDIP – D, I, P – D, I out
- REDO – O, D out
- REDIP – D, I out
- REDIT – D, I, T out
- REDO – D, O out

- Pattern: R E _ _ _
- Letters already ruled out: A, I, S, O, D, B, L, N, T, Y
- Remaining unused letters (and not yet eliminated): C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W, etc.

Among these, the most common consonants left are C, F, G, H, K, M, P.

We need two more letters to fill R E _ _ _ using only the allowed set. Let’s look for common 5-letter words that fit:

Possible endings with allowed letters:
- C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U

Some candidates:
- R E C _ _  → “RECUM” (invalid)
- R E C _ _  → “RECKS” (invalid, S is out)
- R E C _ _  → “RECK” (needs 5 letters)
- R E C U _  → “RECU_” doesn’t form a word

Hmm, none of these combinations seem to form valid English words. Let’s step back.

We need a valid 5-letter word starting with RE, using only letters not yet eliminated. Let’s list all such words:

Looking at a dictionary, valid words starting with RE using allowed letters:

- REACH – A is out
- REACT – A, C, T are allowed, but T is out
- REBID – B, I, D are out
- RECUT – C, U are allowed, but T is out
- REDEY – D, Y are out
- REFER – F is allowed, but second R is allowed? Wait, we haven’t ruled out R twice. Actually, we don’t have info about double letters, but we have no reason to exclude it. However, we have no evidence against it yet.

Wait, let’s check: we have no info that R appears more than once, so it’s safe to assume single R for now.

- REGMA – A, M are allowed, but A is out
- RELIC – L, I, C – L and I are out
- REMIT – M, I, T – M is allowed, but I and T are out
- REPAY – A, Y are out
- RESUM – S, U, M – S is out
- RETIE – T, I, E – T and I are out
- REUSE – U, S – S is out
- REWED – W, E, D – D is out
- REWEL – L is out
- REWED – D is out
- REWEE – E is already placed
- REWER – W, E, R – seems valid, but let’s check letters: W, E, R are allowed (W not yet tested, E is correct, R is correct). However, we have no info about W yet.

But “WERER” isn’t a word. “REWED” is valid but D is out. “REWER” isn’t valid.

Another candidate: “REPEM” – not a word.

Wait, let’s list all valid English words starting with RE and see which fit our allowed letters:

Valid words starting with RE (from dictionary):
- REACH – A out
- REACT – A, T out
- REBARK – B, A, R, K – B, A out

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters to maximize information gain
2. Avoids repeating letters to test more possibilities
3. Contains vowels to help identify vowel positions

A great starting word should have a mix of common consonants and vowels. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E) to test vowel positions
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, maximizing tested letters

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word and in the correct first position (✓)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (–) – it is NOT in the 5th spot
- A, I, S are not in the word at all (x)

So far we know:
1. Word starts with R
2. Word contains E somewhere, but not at the end
3. Letters NOT in the word: A, I, S

I want a second guess that:
- Keeps R in the first spot
- Moves E to a new position (positions 2, 3, or 4)
- Uses new common consonants and vowels not yet tested
- Avoids A, I, S entirely

Good letters to test next: T, N, L, C, K, O, U, D, M, etc.

Possible candidates: RODEO, RUTTE (invalid – two T’s), RENAL (contains A), ROLLE (contains L and O), RUDGE, etc.

I’ll pick RODEO because:
- R stays in spot 1
- O and D are new letters
- E is moved to spot 4
- Contains a second vowel (O) to test

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: RODEO -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(x) D(x) E(-) O(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we know:

1. R is fixed in the first spot.
2. E must appear somewhere, but it is NOT in position 5 (from RAISE) and NOT in position 4 (from RODEO). So E must be in position 2 or 3.
3. Letters definitely absent: A, I, S, O, D.

We need a word that:
- Starts with R
- Contains E in position 2 or 3
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (i.e., not A, I, S, O, D)
- Uses fresh letters to gain new information

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, K, M, G, H, B, F, etc.
Good remaining vowels: U (since A, I, O are out)

Let’s try placing E in position 2 and build a word with new letters:
R _ E _ _

Candidate endings: “RENTS” (invalid – T and S are new but S is already ruled out),
“REBEL” (B and L are new),
“RECK” (needs a fifth letter).

A valid word with fresh letters is “REBEL”:
- R in 1 ✓
- E in 2 (new position) ✓
- B, E, L all new letters (E is already known to be in word, but this tests B and L)
- No eliminated letters

So “REBEL” seems optimal.

Guess 3: REBEL -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) B(x) E(-) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's consolidate what we now know:

1. R is fixed in position 1.
2. E must appear exactly once (since only one “E” has been marked ✓ so far) and it must be in position 2 (because positions 3, 4, 5 have been ruled out).
3. Letters definitely absent: A, I, S, O, D, B, L.

So the pattern is:
R E _ _ _

We need three more letters, each of which:
- is not any of A, I, S, O, D, B, L
- has not yet been tested

Common remaining consonants: T, N, C, K, M, G, H, F, P, Y, W, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (every other vowel has been eliminated).

We want a word that fits R E _ _ _ using only the allowed letters. Some possibilities:
- R E T U _
- R E N T _
- R E C T _
- R E M U _
- R E G A _  (but A is out)
- R E G U _
- R E M U _

A valid 5-letter word that fits is “RENTY” (though “Y” is uncommon as a vowel here). A more common word is “RENTS”, but S is already ruled out. Another valid word is “RECTY” but that’s not common. The most straightforward common word is “RENTS” (invalid due to S). 

Wait, let’s check again:
- R E N T Y – valid word, uses new letters N, T, Y
- R E N U _ – “RENU_” doesn’t form a word
- R E C T Y – “RECTY” isn’t a word
- R E M U _ – “REMUS” but S is out

Actually, the simplest valid common word left is “RENTY”.

But let’s verify: N, T, Y have not been tested and are allowed.

So the next guess is “RENTY”.

From all feedback so far we know:

1. The word starts with RE (positions 1-2 fixed).
2. E appears exactly once (only one “✓” for E so far).
3. Letters definitely absent: A, I, S, O, D, B, L, N, T, Y, F.
4. The final two letters are not yet determined.  
   They must each be from the remaining unused letters: C, G, H, K, M, P, U, W (none of which have been ruled out yet).

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form RE _ _ _ whose last three letters are chosen only from C, G, H, K, M, P, U, W and are not duplicates of any already placed.

Scanning the pattern RE _ _ _ against a mental list of common English words, the only two reasonable candidates that fit are:

- REGUM  (invalid – U and M are allowed, but not a word)
- REHUM  (invalid – H, U, M are allowed, but not a word)
- REPUM  (invalid)
- REWUM  (invalid)

Wait, let’s double-check the dictionary:

Valid English words starting with RE and ending with three letters from C, G, H, K, M, P, U, W:

- REWER – W, E, R – W, E, R – this is a valid word (British English variant of “wore” with a double E, but the spelling is correct).  The letters are R, E, W, E, R.  We already have R and E confirmed, W is new, and the second E is allowed because we only know one E exists, not necessarily that only one E appears.  However, the feedback for REFER showed E(-) in position 4, meaning E is in the word but not in position 4.  Since we already have E in position 2, this does not prevent another E elsewhere.  But the standard Wordle rules treat each letter independently; the (-) only indicates the letter is in the word but not in that specific spot.  Therefore, multiple E’s are possible.

But let’s check the letters: R, E, W, E, R.  R is allowed in position 5 (no restriction yet), E is allowed anywhere except position 4, W is new, and the second E is allowed.  This forms the valid word “REWER”.

Another candidate is “REHUM” but that’s not a valid word.  The only valid candidate left is “REWER”.

Therefore, the next guess is “REWER”.
