For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum information about which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word. 

Another good alternative could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong with its combination of high-frequency letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-)  – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-)  – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x)  – O is NOT in the word.
- S(x)  – S is NOT in the word.
- E(x)  – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R somewhere, but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively.
- It definitely does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Letters we know are present: A, R  
Letters we know are absent: O, S, E  

Next, I want to try a word that keeps A and R but moves them to new positions, while introducing other common letters that haven’t been tested yet. Good candidates are consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, etc., and the remaining vowels I, U.

A good choice is “TRAIN”:
- T – new consonant, high frequency.
- R – already known to be in the word; now in position 2 (was in position 2 in AROSE, so feedback said it’s not in position 2; therefore we must move it to another spot. Here it is in position 2 again, but since feedback said “-” not “✓”, we can safely assume it’s not in position 2, so this guess is still valid because we’re testing a new position for R.)
Wait – actually the feedback said R(-) which means R is in the word but NOT in position 2. So we must move R to a different position. In “TRAIN”, R is in position 2 again, which would be invalid. Let me pick another word.

Better choice: “DRAIN”  
- D – new consonant.
- R – known to be in word, now in position 2 (but feedback said R is NOT in position 2). Still bad.

Next choice: “GRAIN”  
- G – new consonant.
- R – in position 2 (still not allowed).

Better: “CRANK”  
- C – new consonant.
- R – in position 1 (allowed, since previous feedback only ruled out position 2).
- A – known to be in word, now in position 2 (allowed, since previous feedback only ruled out position 1).
- N, K – new letters.

This seems good: tests C, N, K while moving R to position 1 and A to position 2.

Another good alternative could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong with its combination of high-frequency letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-)  – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-)  – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x)  – O is NOT in the word.
- S(x)  – S is NOT in the word.
- E(x)  – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R somewhere, but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively.
- It definitely does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Letters we know are present: A, R  
Letters we know are absent: O, S, E  

Next, I want to try a word that keeps A and R but moves them to new positions, while introducing other common letters that haven’t been tested yet. Good candidates are consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, etc., and the remaining vowels I, U.

A good choice is “TRAIN”:
- T – new consonant, high frequency.
- R – already known to be in the word; now in position 2 (was in position 2 in AROSE, so feedback said it’s not in position 2; therefore we must move it to another spot. Here it is in position 2 again, but since feedback said “-” not “✓”, we can safely assume it’s not in position 2, so this guess is still valid because we’re testing a new position for R.)
Wait – actually the feedback said R(-) which means R is in the word but NOT in position 2. So we must move R to a different position. In “TRAIN”, R is in position 2 again, which would be invalid. Let me pick another word.

Better choice: “DRAIN”  
- D – new consonant.
- R – known to be in word, now in position 2 (but feedback said R is NOT in position 2). Still bad.

Next choice: “GRAIN”  
- G – new consonant.
- R – in position 2 (still not allowed).

Better: “CRANK”  
- C – new consonant.
- R – in position 1 (allowed, since previous feedback only ruled out position 2).
- A – known to be in word, now in position 2 (allowed, since previous feedback only ruled out position 1).
- N, K – new letters.

This seems good: tests C, N, K while moving R to position 1 and A to position 2.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRANK -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 – AROSE  
A(-)  – A is in the word, not in position 1  
R(-)  – R is in the word, not in position 2  
O(x)  – O is not in the word  
S(x)  – S is not in the word  
E(x)  – E is not in the word  

Round 2 – CRANK  
C(✓)  – C is in position 1  
R(-)  – R is in the word, not in position 2 (same as before)  
A(-)  – A is in the word, not in position 3  
N(x)  – N is not in the word  
K(x)  – K is not in the word  

What we now know:
- Pattern: C _ _ _ _  (position 1 = C)
- Must contain: A, R  
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3  
- R cannot be in position 2  
- Must not contain: O, S, E, N, K

Remaining unused common consonants: T, L, D, M, B, G, H, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already known to be present and O, E are out)

We still need to place A and R somewhere in positions 2-5, while introducing new letters.

Let’s try a word that keeps C in position 1, moves A and R to new spots, and adds fresh consonants.

Good candidate: C L A R D  
- C in position 1 ✓  
- L new consonant  
- A moved to position 3 (allowed, since A is only forbidden from 1 and 3? Wait – feedback said A(-) in CRANK, meaning A is not in position 3. So A cannot be in 1 or 3. Must be in 2, 4, or 5.  
Let’s try A in position 2: C A R _ _  
But R cannot be in position 2 (from CRANK feedback R(-)), so R must go in 3, 4, or 5.  
Let’s try C A _ R _  
Need one consonant in position 3 and one in position 5.  
Good choice: C A B R D  
- C ✓ position 1  
- A in position 2 (allowed)  
- B new consonant  
- R in position 4 (allowed)  
- D new consonant  

This satisfies all constraints.

Let’s summarize what we now know after the three guesses.

Known facts:
1. Pattern: C _ _ _ _  (position 1 = C)
2. Must contain: A, R  
3. Must NOT contain: O, S, E, N, K, B, D  
4. Position restrictions:
   - A is not in positions 1, 3  
   - R is not in positions 2, 4  
   - D, B, N, K, S, O, E are all banned.

Letters still allowed (common ones): T, L, M, G, H, I, U, Y, F, W, etc.

We have the form:
C _ _ _ _
and we still need to place A and R somewhere, plus two more distinct letters from the allowed set.

Because A cannot be in 1 or 3 and R cannot be in 2 or 4, the only remaining slots for A are 2, 4, 5 and for R are 3, 5.

Let’s try to keep A in position 2 and R in position 3.  
That gives: C A R _ _

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5.  
Allowed letters that are still unused: T, L, M, G, H, I, U, etc.

Pick two common consonants that haven’t been used yet.  
Let’s try T and L: C A R T L – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Try C A R T Y – “ CARTY ” is not valid.  
Try C A R G Y – “CARGY” is not valid.  
Try C A R M Y – “CARMY” is not valid.  
Try C A R L Y – “CARLY” is not valid.  
Try C A R I Y – “CARIY” is not valid.

Let’s try a different placement.  
Put A in position 4 and R in position 5.  
That gives: C _ _ A R  
We need two letters for positions 2 and 3.  
Allowed letters: T, L, M, G, H, I, U, etc.

Try C H A R M – but M is allowed, H is allowed.  
“CHARM” is a valid English word.

Check constraints:
- C in position 1 ✓  
- H new consonant  
- A in position 3 – but feedback said A(-) in CABRD, which ruled out position 3. So A cannot be in 3.  
Therefore “CHARM” is invalid.

Try A in position 5 and R in position 3.  
That gives: C _ R _ A  
We need letters 2 and 4.  
Try C H R I A – “CHRIA” is not valid.

Try C A L I R – “CALIR” is not valid.  
Try C A M I R – “CAMIR” is not valid.  
Try C A R I T – but R would be in position 3, which is allowed.

Wait, let’s try C A R I T – but T is allowed.  
“CARI T” is not a valid word.  
Try C A R I N – N is banned.

- C ✓ position 1  
- H new consonant  
- I new consonant (sometimes used as vowel)  
- R in position 4 – allowed (restriction was only on 2 and 4, but feedback said R(-) in CABRD, which ruled out position 4. So R cannot be in 4. Therefore “CHIRP” is invalid.

Let’s try C H I R Y – “CHIRY” is not a word.

Let’s try C H A R Y – “CHARY” is a valid English word.

Check constraints:
- C ✓ position 1

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum information about which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word. 

Another good alternative could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong with its combination of high-frequency letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-)  – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-)  – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x)  – O is NOT in the word.
- S(x)  – S is NOT in the word.
- E(x)  – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R somewhere, but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively.
- It definitely does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Letters we know are present: A, R  
Letters we know are absent: O, S, E  

Next, I want to try a word that keeps A and R but moves them to new positions, while introducing other common letters that haven’t been tested yet. Good candidates are consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, etc., and the remaining vowels I, U.

A good choice is “TRAIN”:
- T – new consonant, high frequency.
- R – already known to be in the word; now in position 2 (was in position 2 in AROSE, so feedback said it’s not in position 2; therefore we must move it to another spot. Here it is in position 2 again, but since feedback said “-” not “✓”, we can safely assume it’s not in position 2, so this guess is still valid because we’re testing a new position for R.)
Wait – actually the feedback said R(-) which means R is in the word but NOT in position 2. So we must move R to a different position. In “TRAIN”, R is in position 2 again, which would be invalid. Let me pick another word.

Better choice: “DRAIN”  
- D – new consonant.
- R – known to be in word, now in position 2 (but feedback said R is NOT in position 2). Still bad.

Next choice: “GRAIN”  
- G – new consonant.
- R – in position 2 (still not allowed).

Better: “CRANK”  
- C – new consonant.
- R – in position 1 (allowed, since previous feedback only ruled out position 2).
- A – known to be in word, now in position 2 (allowed, since previous feedback only ruled out position 1).
- N, K – new letters.

This seems good: tests C, N, K while moving R to position 1 and A to position 2.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CRANK -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 – AROSE  
A(-)  – A is in the word, not in position 1  
R(-)  – R is in the word, not in position 2  
O(x)  – O is not in the word  
S(x)  – S is not in the word  
E(x)  – E is not in the word  

Round 2 – CRANK  
C(✓)  – C is in position 1  
R(-)  – R is in the word, not in position 2 (same as before)  
A(-)  – A is in the word, not in position 3  
N(x)  – N is not in the word  
K(x)  – K is not in the word  

What we now know:
- Pattern: C _ _ _ _  (position 1 = C)
- Must contain: A, R  
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3  
- R cannot be in position 2  
- Must not contain: O, S, E, N, K

Remaining unused common consonants: T, L, D, M, B, G, H, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already known to be present and O, E are out)

We still need to place A and R somewhere in positions 2-5, while introducing new letters.

Let’s try a word that keeps C in position 1, moves A and R to new spots, and adds fresh consonants.

Good candidate: C L A R D  
- C in position 1 ✓  
- L new consonant  
- A moved to position 3 (allowed, since A is only forbidden from 1 and 3? Wait – feedback said A(-) in CRANK, meaning A is not in position 3. So A cannot be in 1 or 3. Must be in 2, 4, or 5.  
Let’s try A in position 2: C A R _ _  
But R cannot be in position 2 (from CRANK feedback R(-)), so R must go in 3, 4, or 5.  
Let’s try C A _ R _  
Need one consonant in position 3 and one in position 5.  
Good choice: C A B R D  
- C ✓ position 1  
- A in position 2 (allowed)  
- B new consonant  
- R in position 4 (allowed)  
- D new consonant  

This satisfies all constraints.

Let’s summarize what we now know after the three guesses.

Known facts:
1. Pattern: C _ _ _ _  (position 1 = C)
2. Must contain: A, R  
3. Must NOT contain: O, S, E, N, K, B, D  
4. Position restrictions:
   - A is not in positions 1, 3  
   - R is not in positions 2, 4  
   - D, B, N, K, S, O, E are all banned.

Letters still allowed (common ones): T, L, M, G, H, I, U, Y, F, W, etc.

We have the form:
C _ _ _ _
and we still need to place A and R somewhere, plus two more distinct letters from the allowed set.

Because A cannot be in 1 or 3 and R cannot be in 2 or 4, the only remaining slots for A are 2, 4, 5 and for R are 3, 5.

Let’s try to keep A in position 2 and R in position 3.  
That gives: C A R _ _

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5.  
Allowed letters that are still unused: T, L, M, G, H, I, U, etc.

Pick two common consonants that haven’t been used yet.  
Let’s try T and L: C A R T L – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Try C A R T Y – “ CARTY ” is not valid.  
Try C A R G Y – “CARGY” is not valid.  
Try C A R M Y – “CARMY” is not valid.  
Try C A R L Y – “CARLY” is not valid.  
Try C A R I Y – “CARIY” is not valid.

Let’s try a different placement.  
Put A in position 4 and R in position 5.  
That gives: C _ _ A R  
We need two letters for positions 2 and 3.  
Allowed letters: T, L, M, G, H, I, U, etc.

Try C H A R M – but M is allowed, H is allowed.  
“CHARM” is a valid English word.

Check constraints:
- C in position 1 ✓  
- H new consonant  
- A in position 3 – but feedback said A(-) in CABRD, which ruled out position 3. So A cannot be in 3.  
Therefore “CHARM” is invalid.

Try A in position 5 and R in position 3.  
That gives: C _ R _ A  
We need letters 2 and 4.  
Try C H R I A – “CHRIA” is not valid.  
Try C H R O A – O is banned.  
Try C L R I A – “CLRIA” is not valid.  
Try C L R U A – “CLRU A” is not valid.

Try A in position 2 and R in position 5.  
That gives: C A _ _ R  
We need letters 3 and 4.  
Try C A T I R – “CATIR” is not valid.  
Try C A L I R – “CALIR” is not valid.  
Try C A M I R – “CAMIR” is not valid.  
Try C A R I T – but R would be in position 3, which is allowed.

Wait, let’s try C A R I T – but T is allowed.  
“CARI T” is not a valid word.  
Try C A R I N – N is banned.

Try a different route: use I or U as a vowel.

Let’s try C H A R I – but R would be in position 3, A in 2, but I is allowed.  
“CHA RI” is not a word.

Let’s try C H U R A – “CHURA” is not a word.

Let’s try C L A R I – “CLA RI” is not a word.

Let’s try C L I R A – “CLI RA” is not a word.

Let’s try C H I R A – “CHI RA” is not a word.

Let’s try C H U R A – “CHURA” is not a word.

Let’s try C H I R P – P is allowed.  
“CHIRP” is a valid English word.

Check constraints:
- C ✓ position 1  
- H new consonant  
- I new consonant (sometimes used as vowel)  
- R in position 4 – allowed (restriction was only on 2 and 4, but feedback said R(-) in CABRD, which ruled out position 4. So R cannot be in 4. Therefore “CHIRP” is invalid.

Let’s try C H I R Y – “CHIRY” is not a word.

Let’s try C H A R Y – “CHARY” is a valid English word.

Check constraints:
- C ✓ position 1  
- H new consonant  
- A in position 3 – but A cannot be in 3 (from CABRD feedback). So invalid.

Let’s try C L A R Y – “CLARY” is a word (variant spelling of “clary” as in clary sage), but rare.

Let’s try C L I R K – K is banned.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum information about which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word. 

Another good alternative could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong with its combination of high-frequency letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-)  – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-)  – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x)  – O is NOT in the word.
- S(x)  – S is NOT in the word.
- E(x)  – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R somewhere, but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively.
- It definitely does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Letters we know are present: A, R  
Letters we know are absent: O, S, E  

Next, I want to try a word that keeps A and R but moves them to new positions, while introducing other common letters that haven’t been tested yet. Good candidates are consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, etc., and the remaining vowels I, U.

A good choice is “TRAIN”:
- T – new consonant, high frequency.
- R – already known to be in the word; now in position 2 (was in position 2 in AROSE, so feedback said it’s not in position 2; therefore we must move it to another spot. Here it is in position 2 again, but since feedback said “-” not “✓”, we can safely assume it’s not in position 2, so this guess is still valid because we’re testing a new position for R.)
Wait – actually the feedback said R(-) which means R is in the word but NOT in position 2. So we must move R to a different position. In “TRAIN”, R is in position 2 again, which would be invalid. Let me pick another word.

Better choice: “DRAIN”  
- D – new consonant.
- R – known to be in word, now in position 2 (but feedback said R is NOT in position 2). Still bad.

Next choice: “GRAIN”  
- G – new consonant.
- R – in position 2 (still not allowed).

Better: “CRANK”  
- C – new consonant.
- R – in position 1 (allowed, since previous feedback only ruled out position 2).
- A – known to be in word, now in position 2 (allowed, since previous feedback only ruled out position 1).
- N, K – new letters.

This seems good: tests C, N, K while moving R to position 1 and A to position 2.

Guess 2: CRANK -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(-) A(-) N(x) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 – AROSE  
A(-)  – A is in the word, not in position 1  
R(-)  – R is in the word, not in position 2  
O(x)  – O is not in the word  
S(x)  – S is not in the word  
E(x)  – E is not in the word  

Round 2 – CRANK  
C(✓)  – C is in position 1  
R(-)  – R is in the word, not in position 2 (same as before)  
A(-)  – A is in the word, not in position 3  
N(x)  – N is not in the word  
K(x)  – K is not in the word  

What we now know:
- Pattern: C _ _ _ _  (position 1 = C)
- Must contain: A, R  
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3  
- R cannot be in position 2  
- Must not contain: O, S, E, N, K

Remaining unused common consonants: T, L, D, M, B, G, H, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already known to be present and O, E are out)

We still need to place A and R somewhere in positions 2-5, while introducing new letters.

Let’s try a word that keeps C in position 1, moves A and R to new spots, and adds fresh consonants.

Good candidate: C L A R D  
- C in position 1 ✓  
- L new consonant  
- A moved to position 3 (allowed, since A is only forbidden from 1 and 3? Wait – feedback said A(-) in CRANK, meaning A is not in position 3. So A cannot be in 1 or 3. Must be in 2, 4, or 5.  
Let’s try A in position 2: C A R _ _  
But R cannot be in position 2 (from CRANK feedback R(-)), so R must go in 3, 4, or 5.  
Let’s try C A _ R _  
Need one consonant in position 3 and one in position 5.  
Good choice: C A B R D  
- C ✓ position 1  
- A in position 2 (allowed)  
- B new consonant  
- R in position 4 (allowed)  
- D new consonant  

This satisfies all constraints.

Let’s summarize what we now know after the three guesses.

Known facts:
1. Pattern: C _ _ _ _  (position 1 = C)
2. Must contain: A, R  
3. Must NOT contain: O, S, E, N, K, B, D  
4. Position restrictions:
   - A is not in positions 1, 3  
   - R is not in positions 2, 4  
   - D, B, N, K, S, O, E are all banned.

Letters still allowed (common ones): T, L, M, G, H, I, U, Y, F, W, etc.

We have the form:
C _ _ _ _
and we still need to place A and R somewhere, plus two more distinct letters from the allowed set.

Because A cannot be in 1 or 3 and R cannot be in 2 or 4, the only remaining slots for A are 2, 4, 5 and for R are 3, 5.

Let’s try to keep A in position 2 and R in position 3.  
That gives: C A R _ _

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5.  
Allowed letters that are still unused: T, L, M, G, H, I, U, etc.

Check constraints:
- C in position 1 ✓

From all feedback so far:

1. Fixed: C is the first letter → C _ _ _ _
2. Must contain: A, R  
3. Must NOT contain: O, S, E, N, K, B, D, U, L, Y  
4. Position restrictions:
   - A cannot be in positions 1, 3  
   - R cannot be in positions 2, 4  

Allowed remaining letters (common ones): T, M, G, H, I, F, W, V, etc.

We have the form:
C _ _ _ _
and we still need to place A and R plus two more distinct letters from the allowed set.

Because A cannot be in 1 or 3 and R cannot be in 2 or 4, the only remaining slots for A are 2, 4, 5 and for R are 3, 5.

Let’s try to keep A in position 2 and R in position 5.  
That gives: C A _ _ R  
We need two letters for positions 3 and 4.  
Allowed letters that are still unused: T, M, G, H, I, F, W, V, etc.

Pick two common consonants that haven’t been used yet.  
Let’s try T and M: C A T M R – not a valid word.  
Try C A T G R – “CATEG” is not a word.  
Try C A T H R – “CATHR” is not a word.  
Try C A M G R – not a word.  
Try C A M I R – “CAMIR” is not a word.  
Try C A F I R – “CA FIR” is not a word.  
Try C A V I R – “CAVIR” is not a word.  
Try C A P I R – P is allowed, but “CAPIR” is not a word.  
Try C A R I T – but R would be in position 3, which is allowed.

Let’s try a different placement.  
Put A in position 4 and R in position 5.  
That gives: C _ _ A R  
We need two letters for positions 2 and 3.  
Try C H I A R – “CHIA R” is not a word.  
Try C H I A R – invalid.  
Try C H I A R – not valid.

Let’s try A in position 5 and R in position 3.  
That gives: C _ R _ A  
We need letters 2 and 4.  
Try C H R I A – “CHRIA” is not a word.  
Try C H R I A – invalid.  
Try C H R I A – not valid.

Let’s try A in position 2 and R in position 3.  
That gives: C A R _ _  
We need letters 4 and 5.  
Try C A R T I – “CAR TI” is not a word.  
Try C A R T Y – Y is banned.  
Try C A R M I – “CAMRI” is not a word.  
Try C A R V I – “CAVRI” is not a word.  
Try C A R F I – “CARFI” is not a word.  
Try C A R G I – “CARGI” is not a word.  
Try C A R H I – “CARHI” is not a word.  
Try C A R I M – “CA RIM” is not a word.  
Try C A R I T – “CA RIT” is not a word.  
Try C A R I G – “CA RIG” is not a word.

Let’s try A in position 4 and R in position 3.  
That gives: C _ R A _  
We need letters 2 and 5.  
Try C H R A I – “CHRAI” is not a word.  
Try C H R A M – “CHRAM” is not a word.  
Try C H R A T – “CHRAT” is not a word.  
Try C H R A V – “CHRAV” is not a word.  
Try C H R A G – “CHRAG” is not a word.  
Try C H R A F – “CHRAF” is not a word.

Let’s try a fresh approach: use I or U (but U is banned) so only I is available.

We have C _ _ _ _ and must place A, R, I plus one more letter.

Let’s try A in position 2, R in position 5, and I in position 3 or 4.

Try C A I _ R – need one letter for position 4.  
Allowed letters: T, M, G, H, F, V, W, etc.  
Try C A I T R – “CAITR” is not a word.  
Try C A I M R – “CAIMR” is not a word.  
Try C A I G R – “CAIGR” is not a word.  
Try C A I H R – “CAIHR” is not a word.  
Try C A I V R – “CAIVR” is not a word.  
Try C A I F R – “CAIFR” is not a word.

Try A in position 4, R in position 5, and I in position 2 or 3.

Try C I _ A R – need one letter for position 3.  
Try C I T A R – “CITAR” is a valid English word (a type of lute).

Check constraints:
- C ✓ position 1  
- I new consonant  
- T new consonant  
- A in position 4 – allowed (cannot be 1 or 3)  
- R in position 5 – allowed (cannot be 2 or 4)  

“CITAR” uses only allowed letters and satisfies all positional restrictions.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).\n\nThe word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum information about which vowels and consonants might be in the secret word. \n\nAnother good alternative could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong with its combination of high-frequency letters.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(-)  – A is in the word but not in position 1.\n- R(-)  – R is in the word but not in position 2.\n- O(x)  – O is NOT in the word.\n- S(x)  – S is NOT in the word.\n- E(x)  – E is NOT in the word.\n\nSo we know:\n- The word contains A and R somewhere, but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively.\n- It definitely does NOT contain O, S, or E.\n\nLetters we know are present: A, R  \nLetters we know are absent: O, S, E  \n\nNext, I want to try a word that keeps A and R but moves them to new positions, while introducing other common letters that haven’t been tested yet. Good candidates are consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, etc., and the remaining vowels I, U.\n\nA good choice is “TRAIN”:\n- T – new consonant, high frequency.\n- R – already known to be in the word; now in position 2 (was in position 2 in AROSE, so feedback said it’s not in position 2; therefore we must move it to another spot.

All five letters are now confirmed:

C(✓)  - position 1  
I(✓)  - position 2  
A(✓)  - position 4  
R(✓)  - position 5  

The only unknown is position 3.  
Letters already ruled out: O, S, E, N, K, B, D, U, L, Y, T, plus the letters C, I, A, R which are already placed.

Remaining common consonants not yet used: M, G, H, F, V, W, P, etc.

We need a 5-letter word of the form:
C I _ A R

The only common English word that fits is:
C I M A R  → “CIMAR” is not valid.
C I G A R  → “CIGAR” is valid.

Check constraints:
- C, I, A, R already fixed in positions 1–2–4–5.  
- G is not yet ruled out.  

Therefore the unique remaining possibility is “CIGAR”.
