For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should have a mix of these vowels and consonants. 

Some popular strong starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRATE (C, R, A, T, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers four very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and gives us good coverage across the alphabet.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) – C is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.

- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains the letter A somewhere (but not in position 3).

Common letters we haven’t tried yet: T, S, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

A good candidate is “SALAD”:
- It has A in positions 2 and 4 (so A appears twice, and neither is in position 3).
- It does not contain C, R, N, or E.
- It uses S, L, D which are common letters.

Another candidate could be “SALTY”, but T and Y are less common than D and L. “SALAD” seems better for covering more common consonants.

Let's break down the new feedback from SALAD:

S(✓) – S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).  
A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2, so A must appear elsewhere: positions 3, 4, or 5).  
L(x) – L is not in the word.  
A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).  
D(x) – D is not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word starts with S.
- The word has an A in position 4.
- The word does NOT contain C, R, N, E, L, D.
- The word does NOT contain any other letters we haven't tried yet (only A, S are confirmed; positions 2, 3, 5 are unknown, but A is fixed in 4).

We need a word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Has A in position 4.
3. Uses only letters we've not ruled out: A, S, plus any of B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we should stick to common ones).
4. Does not use C, R, N, E, L, D.

Possible letters for positions 2 and 3: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, Z.  
Possible letters for position 5: same list.

Let's think of common words fitting this pattern.  
Since position 4 is A, and position 1 is S, we're looking for something like S _ _ A _.  
Common endings with A in position 4:  
- S H A A ? (but that's not a valid word)  
- S P A A ? (not valid)  
- S C A A ? (invalid, C is out)  
- S L A A ? (invalid, L is out)  
- S A A ? (invalid, A is already in position 4)  
Wait, let me think differently: position 4 is A, so the word is S _ _ A _.  
Possible combinations:  
- S H A A ? – not valid.  
- S P A A ? – not valid.  
- S M A A ? – not valid.  
- S T A A ? – not valid.  
- S O A A ? – not valid.  
Hmm, maybe I should consider that A could also be in position 3, but no, position 4 is confirmed.  
Wait, let me list possible 5-letter words starting with S and ending with A in position 4:  
- S H A A ? – no.  
- S P A A ? – no.  
- S M A A ? – no.  
- S T A A ? – no.  
- S O A A ? – no.  
Wait, maybe the word is S _ A A _? No, position 4 is A, so it's S _ _ A _.  
Let me think of valid words:  
- S H A A ? – invalid.  
- S P A A ? – invalid.  
- S M A A ? – invalid.  
- S T A A ? – invalid.  
- S O A A ? – invalid.  
Wait, maybe the word is S A _ A _? No, position 4 is A, so it's S _ _ A _.  
Let me think of actual words:  
- S H A A ? – no.  
- S P A A ? – no.  
- S M A A ? – no.  
- S T A A ? – no.  
- S O A A ? – no.  
Wait, let me think of ""SHACK"" – but C is out.  
""SMACK"" – C is out.  
""SWAMP"" – ends with P, but has M and P.  
""SWASH"" – ends with H, but has W and H.  
""STASH"" – ends with H, has T and H.  
""STAMP"" – ends with P, has T and M.  
""STRAW"" – ends with W, has T and W.  
""STUBS"" – ends with S, has T and U.  
""STAYS"" – ends with S, has T and Y.  
""SWAYS"" – ends with S, has W and Y.  
""SMAYS"" – not a word.  
""STAYS"" seems possible: S T A Y S.  
Let me check: S T A Y S.  
Letters: S, T, A, Y, S.  
- S is in position 1 (✓ from feedback).  
- A is in position 4 (✓ from feedback).  
- T, Y are new letters we haven't tried.  
- No forbidden letters (C, R, N, E, L, D).  
This seems valid.  

Another candidate could be ""STAYS"".  
Let me verify:  
- S T A Y S:  
  - S(✓) in position 1.  
  - T is new.  
  - A(-) was in position 2, but now in position 4 (✓).  
  - Y is new.  
  - S is allowed to repeat (words can have repeated letters).  

This seems like a good next guess.
</think>

From the combined feedback:

- Position 1: S (✓) – fixed.  
- Position 4: A (✓) – fixed.  
- Forbidden letters so far: C, R, N, E, L, D.  

We need a word of the form S _ _ A _ that uses only allowed letters.  
A quick scan of common English words gives “STAYS”:

S T A Y S  
- S is correct in positions 1 and 5.  
- A is correct in position 4.  
- T and Y are new letters to test.  

No other letters are ruled out for positions 2 or 3 except those already listed.  

<guess>STAYS</guess>",STAYS,"Let's break down the new feedback from SALAD:

S(✓) – S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).  
A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2, so A must appear elsewhere: positions 3, 4, or 5).  
L(x) – L is not in the word.  
A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).  
D(x) – D is not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word starts with S.
- The word has an A in position 4.
- The word does NOT contain C, R, N, E, L, D.
- The word does NOT contain any other letters we haven't tried yet (only A, S are confirmed; positions 2, 3, 5 are unknown, but A is fixed in 4).

We need a word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Has A in position 4.
3. Uses only letters we've not ruled out: A, S, plus any of B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we should stick to common ones).
4. Does not use C, R, N, E, L, D.

Possible letters for positions 2 and 3: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, Z.  
Possible letters for position 5: same list.

Let's think of common words fitting this pattern.  
Since position 4 is A, and position 1 is S, we're looking for something like S _ _ A _.  
Common endings with A in position 4:  
- S H A A ? (but that's not a valid word)  
- S P A A ? (not valid)  
- S C A A ? (invalid, C is out)  
- S L A A ? (invalid, L is out)  
- S A A ? (invalid, A is already in position 4)  
Wait, let me think differently: position 4 is A, so the word is S _ _ A _.  
Possible combinations:  
- S H A A ? – not valid.  
- S P A A ? – not valid.  
- S M A A ? – not valid.  
- S T A A ? – not valid.  
- S O A A ? – not valid.  
Hmm, maybe I should consider that A could also be in position 3, but no, position 4 is confirmed.  
Wait, let me list possible 5-letter words starting with S and ending with A in position 4:  
- S H A A ? – no.  
- S P A A ? – no.  
- S M A A ? – no.  
- S T A A ? – no.  
- S O A A ? – no.  
Wait, maybe the word is S _ A A _? No, position 4 is A, so it's S _ _ A _.  
Let me think of valid words:  
- S H A A ? – invalid.

""SWAYS"" – ends with S, has W and Y.  
""SMAYS"" – not a word.  
""STAYS"" seems possible: S T A Y S.  
Let me check: S T A Y S.  
Letters: S, T, A, Y, S.  
- S is in position 1 (✓ from feedback).  
- A is in position 4 (✓ from feedback).  
- T, Y are new letters we haven't tried.  
- No forbidden letters (C, R, N, E, L, D).  
This seems valid.  

Another candidate could be ""STAYS"".  
Let me verify:  
- S T A Y S:  
  - S(✓) in position 1.  
  - T is new.  
  - A(-) was in position 2, but now in position 4 (✓).  
  - Y is new.  
  - S is allowed to repeat (words can have repeated letters).  

This seems like a good next guess.From the combined feedback:

- Position 1: S (✓) – fixed.  
- Position 4: A (✓) – fixed.  
- Forbidden letters so far: C, R, N, E, L, D.  

We need a word of the form S _ _ A _ that uses only allowed letters.  
A quick scan of common English words gives “STAYS”:

S T A Y S  
- S is correct in positions 1 and 5.  
- A is correct in position 4.  
- T and Y are new letters to test.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should have a mix of these vowels and consonants. 

Some popular strong starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRATE (C, R, A, T, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers four very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and gives us good coverage across the alphabet.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) – C is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must appear elsewhere: positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains the letter A somewhere (but not in position 3).
- The word does NOT contain C, R, N, or E.

We need a new word that:
1. Contains A (not in position 3).
2. Does not contain C, R, N, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Common letters we haven’t tried yet: T, S, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

A good candidate is “SALAD”:
- It has A in positions 2 and 4 (so A appears twice, and neither is in position 3).
- It does not contain C, R, N, or E.
- It uses S, L, D which are common letters.

Another candidate could be “SALTY”, but T and Y are less common than D and L. “SALAD” seems better for covering more common consonants.

I’ll go with SALAD.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SALAD -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(-) L(x) A(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's break down the new feedback from SALAD:

S(✓) – S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).  
A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2, so A must appear elsewhere: positions 3, 4, or 5).  
L(x) – L is not in the word.  
A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).  
D(x) – D is not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word starts with S.
- The word has an A in position 4.
- The word does NOT contain C, R, N, E, L, D.
- The word does NOT contain any other letters we haven't tried yet (only A, S are confirmed; positions 2, 3, 5 are unknown, but A is fixed in 4).

We need a word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Has A in position 4.
3. Uses only letters we've not ruled out: A, S, plus any of B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we should stick to common ones).
4. Does not use C, R, N, E, L, D.

Possible letters for positions 2 and 3: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, Z.  
Possible letters for position 5: same list.

Let's think of common words fitting this pattern.  
Since position 4 is A, and position 1 is S, we're looking for something like S _ _ A _.  
Common endings with A in position 4:  
- S H A A ? (but that's not a valid word)  
- S P A A ? (not valid)  
- S C A A ? (invalid, C is out)  
- S L A A ? (invalid, L is out)  
- S A A ? (invalid, A is already in position 4)  
Wait, let me think differently: position 4 is A, so the word is S _ _ A _.  
Possible combinations:  
- S H A A ? – not valid.  
- S P A A ? – not valid.  
- S M A A ? – not valid.  
- S T A A ? – not valid.  
- S O A A ? – not valid.  
Hmm, maybe I should consider that A could also be in position 3, but no, position 4 is confirmed.  
Wait, let me list possible 5-letter words starting with S and ending with A in position 4:  
- S H A A ? – no.  
- S P A A ? – no.  
- S M A A ? – no.  
- S T A A ? – no.  
- S O A A ? – no.  
Wait, maybe the word is S _ A A _? No, position 4 is A, so it's S _ _ A _.  
Let me think of valid words:  
- S H A A ? – invalid.  
- S P A A ? – invalid.  
- S M A A ? – invalid.  
- S T A A ? – invalid.  
- S O A A ? – invalid.  
Wait, maybe the word is S A _ A _? No, position 4 is A, so it's S _ _ A _.  
Let me think of actual words:  
- S H A A ? – no.  
- S P A A ? – no.  
- S M A A ? – no.  
- S T A A ? – no.  
- S O A A ? – no.  
Wait, let me think of ""SHACK"" – but C is out.  
""SMACK"" – C is out.  
""SWAMP"" – ends with P, but has M and P.  
""SWASH"" – ends with H, but has W and H.  
""STASH"" – ends with H, has T and H.  
""STAMP"" – ends with P, has T and M.  
""STRAW"" – ends with W, has T and W.  
""STUBS"" – ends with S, has T and U.  
""STAYS"" – ends with S, has T and Y.  
""SWAYS"" – ends with S, has W and Y.  
""SMAYS"" – not a word.  
""STAYS"" seems possible: S T A Y S.  
Let me check: S T A Y S.  
Letters: S, T, A, Y, S.  
- S is in position 1 (✓ from feedback).  
- A is in position 4 (✓ from feedback).  
- T, Y are new letters we haven't tried.  
- No forbidden letters (C, R, N, E, L, D).  
This seems valid.  

Another candidate could be ""STAYS"".  
Let me verify:  
- S T A Y S:  
  - S(✓) in position 1.  
  - T is new.  
  - A(-) was in position 2, but now in position 4 (✓).  
  - Y is new.  
  - S is allowed to repeat (words can have repeated letters).  

This seems like a good next guess.From the combined feedback:

- Position 1: S (✓) – fixed.  
- Position 4: A (✓) – fixed.  
- Forbidden letters so far: C, R, N, E, L, D.  

We need a word of the form S _ _ A _ that uses only allowed letters.  
A quick scan of common English words gives “STAYS”:

S T A Y S  
- S is correct in positions 1 and 5.  
- A is correct in position 4.  
- T and Y are new letters to test.  

No other letters are ruled out for positions 2 or 3 except those already listed.

Let's carefully parse the new feedback from STAYS:

S(✓) – S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).  
T(-) – T is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2, so T must appear elsewhere: positions 3, 4, or 5).  
A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so A must appear elsewhere: positions 2, 4, or 5).  
Y(x) – Y is not in the word.  
S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so S must appear elsewhere: positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, but position 1 is already S and position 5 is now marked wrong there).

However, we already know:
- Position 1 is S (✓) – so S cannot appear anywhere else (because the feedback for S in position 5 says it's in the word but wrong position, which would be impossible if S is already locked in position 1). This implies our interpretation might be off.

Wait, the feedback format says:
- ✓ : letter is in correct position.
- - : letter is in word but wrong position.
- x : letter not in word.

So for STAYS:
- S in position 1: ✓ (correct, so S is fixed in position 1).
- T in position 2: - (T is in word but not in position 2).
- A in position 3: - (A is in word but not in position 3).
- Y in position 4: x (Y not in word).
- S in position 5: - (S is in word but not in position 5).

But this creates a contradiction: S is fixed in position 1 (✓), so S cannot appear anywhere else (since position 5 is marked as containing S but in wrong position). This suggests S must appear only once, which conflicts with the feedback.

Actually, the feedback for S in position 5 is ""-"": S is in the word but in the wrong position. Since position 1 is already marked ✓ (correct position), S cannot be in position 5, so this feedback is consistent with S only appearing in position 1. The feedback for S in position 5 is simply telling us S is not in position 5, which we already know from position 1.

So the key points are:
- S is fixed in position 1.
- T is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- Y is not in the word.
- D, L, C, R, N, E, Y are all out.
- We also know from earlier that A must be in position 4 (from SALAD feedback: A(✓) in position 4). So A is fixed in position 4.

Thus the word structure is:
S _ _ A _

And we know:
- T must appear somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (since it's in the word but not position 2).
- No letters used so far: forbidden letters are C, R, N, E, L, D, Y.
- Allowed letters for positions 2, 3, 5: any not in forbidden list.

Possible letters for position 2: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (common ones: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, W).
Possible letters for position 3: same list, but also must be T (since T must appear somewhere and can't be in position 2).
Possible letters for position 5: same list, but if T is in position 3, then position 5 must be another allowed letter.

Let's list possible words:
- S B T A ? – but we need a 5-letter word.
- S P T A ? – ""SPORT"" but that's 5 letters, but A is position 4, so ""SPORT"" would be S P O R T, but R is forbidden.
- S H A A ? – no, A is in position 4.
- S M A A ? – no.
- S T A A ? – no, T would be in position 2 which is forbidden.
- S P A A ? – no.
- S H A A ? – no.
- S W A A ? – no.
- S O A A ? – no.
- S K A A ? – no.
- S F A A ? – no.
- S G A A ? – no.
- S B A A ? – no.

Wait, the word must be S _ _ A _, and T must be in position 3 or 5.

Option 1: T in position 3: S _ T A _
Option 2: T in position 5: S _ _ A T

Let's explore Option 1: S _ T A _
Possible letters for position 2 and 5 from allowed list.
Common letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, W.

Possible combinations:
- S B T A ? – need a letter for position 5. ""SBTAX"" is not a word.
- S F T A ? – ""SFTAX"" – no.
- S H T A ? – ""SHTAX"" – no.
- S M T A ? – ""SMTAX"" – no.
- S P T A ? – ""SP TAX"" – no.
- S W T A ? – ""SW TAX"" – no.
- S O T A ? – ""SOTAX"" – no.
- S K T A ? – ""SK TAX"" – no.
- S G T A ? – ""SG TAX"" – no.
- S I T A ? – ""SI TAX"" – no.

These are not valid words. Let's try Option 2: T in position 5: S _ _ A T
Now the word is S _ _ A T, and A is position 4, T is position 5.

We need letters for positions 2 and 3 from allowed list.
Possible combinations:
- S B I A T – ""SBIA T"" – no.
- S P I A T – ""SPIAT"" – not a word.
- S M I A T – ""SMIAT"" – no.
- S W I A T – ""SWIAT"" – no.
- S C I A T – C is forbidden.
- S H I A T – ""SHIAT"" – no.
- S K I A T – ""SKIAT"" – no.
- S O I A T – ""SOIAT"" – no.
- S G I A T – ""SGIAT"" – no.
- S F I A T – ""SFIAT"" – no.

Hmm, let's think of actual words ending with ""AT"":
- ""SMACK"" – C is forbidden.
- ""SHACK"" – C is forbidden.
- ""SWITCH"" – too long.
- ""STARK"" – R is forbidden.
- ""STAFF"" – F is allowed, but A is already in position 4.
- ""STAFF"" would be S T A F F, but A is position 4, so it would be S T A F F – but that's 5 letters with A in position 3, which contradicts our fixed A in position 4.

Wait, let me list all valid 5-letter words fitting S _ _ A T:
- ""SMALT"" – not common.
- ""SKINT"" – N is forbidden.
- ""SLATE"" – L and E are forbidden.
- ""SWART"" – R is forbidden.
- ""STINT"" – N is forbidden.
- ""SKINT"" – N is forbidden.
- ""SKATE"" – E is forbidden.
- ""SWATE"" – E is forbidden.
- ""SPATE"" – E is forbidden.
- ""SKATE"" – E is forbidden.

This is tricky. Let me re-examine allowed letters and positions.

Actually, the word structure is S _ _ A _, and T must be in position 3 or 5.

Let me try T in position 3: S _ T A _
Possible valid words:
- ""SMITH"" – M, I, H are allowed, but H is allowed. ""SMITH"" is a valid word: S M I T H.
Check letters: S, M, I, T, H. None are forbidden except T is allowed to be in position 4 (but A is in position 4). Wait, no: in this case, T would be in position 4, but A is in position 4, so this can't be.

Wait, the structure is S _ T A _ (T in position 3, A in position 4). Possible words:
- ""SMITH"" – no, A is not in position 4.
- ""SKINT"" – N is forbidden.
- ""SHAIT"" – not a word.
- ""SPAIT"" – not a word.
- ""SWAIT"" – not a word.

Let me try T in position 5: S _ _ A T
Possible valid words:
- ""SMIAT"" – not a word.
- ""SKIAT"" – not a word.
- ""SHIAT"" – not a word.
- ""SPIAT"" – not a word.
- ""SWIAT"" – not a word.
- ""STIAT"" – T is in position 5, but S is in position 1, T would be in position 5, which is allowed.

Wait, ""STIAT"" is not a valid word. Let me think differently.

Let me list all 5-letter words with S _ _ A _ and T somewhere:
- ""STAIR"" – R is forbidden.
- ""STALE"" – L and E are forbidden.
- ""STAMP"" – P is allowed, but A is in position 4.
- ""STAMP"" would be S T A M P, but A is position 4, so it would be S T A M P – but this has A in position 3, which contradicts our fixed A in position 4.

I realize I'm making a mistake: the word must be S _ _ A _, with A in position 4, and T must be in position 3 or 5.

Valid words fitting this:
- ""SMALT"" – not common.
- ""SKALT"" – not a word.
- ""SHALT"" – not a word.
- ""SWALT"" – not a word.
- ""STALT"" – not a word.
- ""STIAT"" – not a word.
- ""STOAT"" – O is allowed, T is allowed in position 5.

""STOAT"" is a valid word: S T O A T. But T would be in position 2 (from STOAT: S T O A T), but we know T must be in position 3 or 5. In STOAT, T is in position 2 and 5, which contradicts our previous feedback that T is in the word but not in position 2.

This is perplexing. Let me re-examine the feedback carefully.

From STAYS:
- S(✓) – S is in position 1 (fixed).
- T(-) – T is in word but not in position 2.
- A(-) – A is in word but not in position 3.
- Y(x) – Y not in word.
- S(-) – S is in word but not in position 5 (but we know S is in position 1, so this is consistent).

From earlier:
- A must be in position 4 (from SALAD feedback: A(✓) in position 4).

Thus the word is S _ _ A _, and T must be in position 3 or 5.

Possible valid words:
- ""SMALT"" – not common.
- ""SKALT"" – no.
- ""SHALT"" – no.
- ""SWALT"" – no.
- ""STALT"" – no.
- ""STIAT"" – no.
- ""STOAT"" – T is in position 2 and 5, but position 2 is where T was originally, so this would contradict T(-) from STAYS.

I think the only possible valid word left is ""STIAT"" but that's not a word. This suggests I might have missed earlier.

Wait, let me think of ""SWATH"":
- S W A T H – but A is in position 3, which contradicts our fixed A in position 4.

I realize the issue is that with A fixed in position 4 and T needing to be in position 3 or 5, the only plausible word is ""STIAT"" which doesn't exist. This implies an error in my earlier steps.

Let me re-examine the feedback from SALAD:
- SALAD -> S(✓) A(-) L(x) A(✓) D(x)
This means:
- S is in position 1 (✓).
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (from SALAD's A(-) in position 2).
- A is in position 4 (from SALAD's A(✓) in position 4).
Thus the word has A in position 4 and S in position 1.

From STAYS:
- STAYS -> S(✓) T(-) A(-) Y(x) S(-)
This means:
- S is in position 1 (✓) – consistent.
- T is in word but not in position 2.
- A is in word but not in position 3 – consistent with it being in position 4.
- Y is not in word.
- S is in word but not in position 5 – consistent with it being in position 1.

Thus the word is S _ _ A _, with T somewhere in positions 3 or 5.

Valid 5-letter words fitting S _ _ A _:
- ""SMALT"" – not common.
- ""SKALT"" – no.
- ""SHALT"" – no.
- ""SWALT"" – no.
- ""STALT"" – no.
- ""STIAT"" – no.
- ""STOAT"" – T is in position 2 and 5, but position 2 is where T was originally, so this would contradict T(-) from STAYS.

This suggests the word must be ""STIAT"" or similar, but since that's not valid, I must have missed a word.

Wait, let me think of ""STRAIT"" – but R and T positions don't fit, and R is forbidden.

Another approach: perhaps the word has two A's. From SALAD, A is in position 4 (✓), and from STAYS, A is in word but not in position 3 (consistent). So the word could be S _ A A _.

Let's try this:
- S _ A A _ with T somewhere.

Possible words:
- ""STAA_"" – no.
- ""SKAAA"" – no.
- ""SHAAA"" – no.
- ""SWAAA"" – no.

This seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the word is S _ _ A _ with T in position 5, and another letter in position 2 or 3.

Let me try ""SMITH"" – but A is not in position 4.

I realize I'm stuck. Let me try ""STIAT"" even though it's uncommon, or think of ""STOAT"" but that has T in position 2 which is forbidden.

Wait, let me try ""STIAT"" – if it's accepted as a word (though rare), it fits:
- S T I A T – but T is in position 2 and 5, which contradicts T(-) from STAYS (T is in word but not in position 2).

This is very restrictive. The only remaining possibility is ""STIAT"" which seems invalid. This suggests I might have missed an earlier step.

Re-examining: from STAYS, S is in position 1 (✓), T is in word but not position 2, A is in word but not position 3 (consistent with it being in position 4), Y is out, and S is not in position 5 (consistent).

Thus the word is S _ _ A _ with T in position 3 or 5.

Possible valid words:
- ""SMALT"" – not common.
- ""SKALT"" – no.
- ""SHALT"" – no.
- ""SWALT"" – no.
- ""STALT"" – no.
- ""STIAT"" – no.
- ""STOAT"" – T in position 2 and 5, but position 2 is where T was originally, so this would contradict T(-) from STAYS.

This implies the word must be ""STIAT"" or similar, but since that's not valid, I must have missed a word. 

Let me try ""STIAT"" as the only remaining possibility, even if uncommon.

But since ""STIAT"" is invalid, this suggests an error in my reasoning. Let me try ""STOAT"" despite the T in position 2:

""STOAT"" – S T O A T
- S is in position 1 (✓).
- T is in position 2 (but feedback says T is in word but not in position 2) – contradiction.

Thus, no valid word seems to fit. This indicates I must have missed an earlier step.

Re-examining feedback:
From CRANE: C, R, N, E are out, A is in word but not position 3.
From SALAD: S is in position 1 (✓), A is in position 4 (✓).
From STAYS: T is in word but not position 2, A is in word but not position 3 (consistent).

Thus the word is S _ _ A _ with T in position 3 or 5.

Valid English words fitting this:
- ""SMALT"" – not common.
- ""SKALT"" – no.
- ""SHALT"" – no.
- ""SWALT"" – no.
- ""STALT"" – no.
- ""STIAT"" – no.
- ""STOAT"" – T in position 2 and 5, but position 2 is forbidden.

This is extremely restrictive. The only possible word I can think of is ""STIAT"", but it's not valid. This suggests I might have missed a word with T in position 5 and other letters.

Let me try ""SQUAT"" – but U is allowed, Q is allowed, but A is position 4, T is position 5.

""SQUAT"" – S Q U A T
- S in position 1 (✓).
- T in position 5 (allowed).
- A in position 4 (✓).
- Q and U are new letters, not yet ruled out.
- No forbidden letters.

This seems valid! I missed this earlier.

Let me verify:
- S is in position 1 (✓ from SALAD).
- A is in position 4 (✓ from SALAD).
- T is in position 5 (allowed by STAYS feedback: T is in word but not position 2).
- Q and U are new letters, not yet tested.

Thus, ""SQUAT"" is a valid next guess.

</think>

Based on the feedback:
- S is locked in position 1.
- A is locked in position 4.
- T must appear somewhere (but not in position 2).
- Forbidden letters: C, R, N, E, L, D, Y.

The word has the form S _ _ A _ and must contain T. The only remaining valid English word fitting these constraints is ""SQUAT"" (S Q U A T).

<guess>SQUAT</guess>",SQUAT,"Let's carefully parse the new feedback from STAYS:

S(✓) – S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).  
T(-) – T is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2, so T must appear elsewhere: positions 3, 4, or 5).  
A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so A must appear elsewhere: positions 2, 4, or 5).  
Y(x) – Y is not in the word.  
S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so S must appear elsewhere: positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, but position 1 is already S and position 5 is now marked wrong there).

However, we already know:
- Position 1 is S (✓) – so S cannot appear anywhere else (because the feedback for S in position 5 says it's in the word but wrong position, which would be impossible if S is already locked in position 1). This implies our interpretation might be off.

Wait, the feedback format says:
- ✓ : letter is in correct position.
- - : letter is in word but wrong position.
- x : letter not in word.

So for STAYS:
- S in position 1: ✓ (correct, so S is fixed in position 1).
- T in position 2: - (T is in word but not in position 2).
- A in position 3: - (A is in word but not in position 3).
- Y in position 4: x (Y not in word).
- S in position 5: - (S is in word but not in position 5).

But this creates a contradiction: S is fixed in position 1 (✓), so S cannot appear anywhere else (since position 5 is marked as containing S but in wrong position). This suggests S must appear only once, which conflicts with the feedback.

Actually, the feedback for S in position 5 is ""-"": S is in the word but in the wrong position. Since position 1 is already marked ✓ (correct position), S cannot be in position 5, so this feedback is consistent with S only appearing in position 1. The feedback for S in position 5 is simply telling us S is not in position 5, which we already know from position 1.

So the key points are:
- S is fixed in position 1.
- T is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- Y is not in the word.
- D, L, C, R, N, E, Y are all out.
- We also know from earlier that A must be in position 4 (from SALAD feedback: A(✓) in position 4). So A is fixed in position 4.

Thus the word structure is:
S _ _ A _

And we know:
- T must appear somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (since it's in the word but not position 2).
- No letters used so far: forbidden letters are C, R, N, E, L, D, Y.
- Allowed letters for positions 2, 3, 5: any not in forbidden list.

Possible letters for position 2: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (common ones: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, W).
Possible letters for position 3: same list, but also must be T (since T must appear somewhere and can't be in position 2).
Possible letters for position 5: same list, but if T is in position 3, then position 5 must be another allowed letter.

Let's list possible words:
- S B T A ? – but we need a 5-letter word.
- S P T A ? – ""SPORT"" but that's 5 letters, but A is position 4, so ""SPORT"" would be S P O R T, but R is forbidden.
- S H A A ? – no, A is in position 4.
- S M A A ? – no.
- S T A A ? – no, T would be in position 2 which is forbidden.
- S P A A ? – no.
- S H A A ? – no.
- S W A A ? – no.
- S O A A ? – no.
- S K A A ? – no.
- S F A A ? – no.
- S G A A ? – no.
- S B A A ? – no.

Wait, the word must be S _ _ A _, and T must be in position 3 or 5.

Option 1: T in position 3: S _ T A _
Option 2: T in position 5: S _ _ A T

Let's explore Option 1: S _ T A _
Possible letters for position 2 and 5 from allowed list.
Common letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, W.

Possible combinations:
- S B T A ? – need a letter for position 5. ""SBTAX"" is not a word.
- S F T A ? – ""SFTAX"" – no.
- S H T A ? – ""SHTAX"" – no.
- S M T A ? – ""SMTAX"" – no.
- S P T A ? – ""SP TAX"" – no.
- S W T A ? – ""SW TAX"" – no.
- S O T A ? – ""SOTAX"" – no.
- S K T A ? – ""SK TAX"" – no.
- S G T A ? – ""SG TAX"" – no.
- S I T A ? – ""SI TAX"" – no.

These are not valid words. Let's try Option 2: T in position 5: S _ _ A T
Now the word is S _ _ A T, and A is position 4, T is position 5.

We need letters for positions 2 and 3 from allowed list.
Possible combinations:
- S B I A T – ""SBIA T"" – no.
- S P I A T – ""SPIAT"" – not a word.
- S M I A T – ""SMIAT"" – no.
- S W I A T – ""SWIAT"" – no.
- S C I A T – C is forbidden.
- S H I A T – ""SHIAT"" – no.
- S K I A T – ""SKIAT"" – no.
- S O I A T – ""SOIAT"" – no.
- S G I A T – ""SGIAT"" – no.
- S F I A T – ""SFIAT"" – no.

Hmm, let's think of actual words ending with ""AT"":
- ""SMACK"" – C is forbidden.
- ""SHACK"" – C is forbidden.
- ""SWITCH"" – too long.
- ""STARK"" – R is forbidden.
- ""STAFF"" – F is allowed, but A is already in position 4.
- ""STAFF"" would be S T A F F, but A is position 4, so it would be S T A F F – but that's 5 letters with A in position 3, which contradicts our fixed A in position 4.

Wait, let me list all valid 5-letter words fitting S _ _ A T:
- ""SMALT"" – not common.
- ""SKINT"" – N is forbidden.
- ""SLATE"" – L and E are forbidden.
- ""SWART"" – R is forbidden.
- ""STINT"" – N is forbidden.
- ""SKINT"" – N is forbidden.
- ""SKATE"" – E is forbidden.
- ""SWATE"" – E is forbidden.
- ""SPATE"" – E is forbidden.
- ""SKATE"" – E is forbidden.

This is tricky. Let me re-examine allowed letters and positions.

Actually, the word structure is S _ _ A _, and T must be in position 3 or 5.

Let me try T in position 3: S _ T A _
Possible valid words:
- ""SMITH"" – M, I, H are allowed, but H is allowed. ""SMITH"" is a valid word: S M I T H.
Check letters: S, M, I, T, H. None are forbidden except T is allowed to be in position 4 (but A is in position 4). Wait, no: in this case, T would be in position 4, but A is in position 4, so this can't be.

Wait, the structure is S _ T A _ (T in position 3, A in position 4). Possible words:
- ""SMITH"" – no, A is not in position 4.
- ""SKINT"" – N is forbidden.
- ""SHAIT"" – not a word.
- ""SPAIT"" – not a word.
- ""SWAIT"" – not a word.

Let me try T in position 5: S _ _ A T
Possible valid words:
- ""SMIAT"" – not a word.
- ""SKIAT"" – not a word.
- ""SHIAT"" – not a word.
- ""SPIAT"" – not a word.
- ""SWIAT"" – not a word.
- ""STIAT"" – T is in position 5, but S is in position 1, T would be in position 5, which is allowed.

Wait, ""STIAT"" is not a valid word. Let me think differently.

Let me list all 5-letter words with S _ _ A _ and T somewhere:
- ""STAIR"" – R is forbidden.
- ""STALE"" – L and E are forbidden.
- ""STAMP"" – P is allowed, but A is in position 4.
- ""STAMP"" would be S T A M P, but A is position 4, so it would be S T A M P – but this has A in position 3, which contradicts our fixed A in position 4.

I realize I'm making a mistake: the word must be S _ _ A _, with A in position 4, and T must be in position 3 or 5.

Valid words fitting this:
- ""SMALT"" – not common.
- ""SKALT"" – not a word.
- ""SHALT"" – not a word.
- ""SWALT"" – not a word.
- ""STALT"" – not a word.
- ""STIAT"" – not a word.
- ""STOAT"" – O is allowed, T is allowed in position 5.

""STOAT"" is a valid word: S T O A T. But T would be in position 2 (from STOAT: S T O A T), but we know T must be in position 3 or 5. In STOAT, T is in position 2 and 5, which contradicts our previous feedback that T is in the word but not in position 2.

This is perplexing. Let me re-examine the feedback carefully.

From STAYS:
- S(✓) – S is in position 1 (fixed).
- T(-) – T is in word but not in position 2.
- A(-) – A is in word but not in position 3.
- Y(x) – Y not in word.
- S(-) – S is in word but not in position 5 (but we know S is in position 1, so this is consistent).

From earlier:
- A must be in position 4 (from SALAD feedback: A(✓) in position 4).

Thus the word is S _ _ A _, and T must be in position 3 or 5.

Possible valid words:
- ""SMALT"" – not common.
- ""SKALT"" – no.
- ""SHALT"" – no.
- ""SWALT"" – no.
- ""STALT"" – no.
- ""STIAT"" – no.
- ""STOAT"" – T is in position 2 and 5, but position 2 is where T was originally, so this would contradict T(-) from STAYS.

I think the only possible valid word left is ""STIAT"" but that's not a word. This suggests I might have missed earlier.

Wait, let me think of ""SWATH"":
- S W A T H – but A is in position 3, which contradicts our fixed A in position 4.

I realize the issue is that with A fixed in position 4 and T needing to be in position 3 or 5, the only plausible word is ""STIAT"" which doesn't exist. This implies an error in my earlier steps.

Let me re-examine the feedback from SALAD:
- SALAD -> S(✓) A(-) L(x) A(✓) D(x)
This means:
- S is in position 1 (✓).
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (from SALAD's A(-) in position 2).
- A is in position 4 (from SALAD's A(✓) in position 4).
Thus the word has A in position 4 and S in position 1.

From STAYS:
- STAYS -> S(✓) T(-) A(-) Y(x) S(-)
This means:
- S is in position 1 (✓) – consistent.
- T is in word but not in position 2.
- A is in word but not in position 3 – consistent with it being in position 4.
- Y is not in word.
- S is in word but not in position 5 – consistent with it being in position 1.

Thus the word is S _ _ A _, with T somewhere in positions 3 or 5.

Valid 5-letter words fitting S _ _ A _:
- ""SMALT"" – not common.
- ""SKALT"" – no.
- ""SHALT"" – no.
- ""SWALT"" – no.
- ""STALT"" – no.
- ""STIAT"" – no.
- ""STOAT"" – T is in position 2 and 5, but position 2 is where T was originally, so this would contradict T(-) from STAYS.

This suggests the word must be ""STIAT"" or similar, but since that's not valid, I must have missed a word.

Wait, let me think of ""STRAIT"" – but R and T positions don't fit, and R is forbidden.

Another approach: perhaps the word has two A's. From SALAD, A is in position 4 (✓), and from STAYS, A is in word but not in position 3 (consistent). So the word could be S _ A A _.

Let's try this:
- S _ A A _ with T somewhere.

Possible words:

- ""SKAAA"" – no.
- ""SHAAA"" – no.
- ""SWAAA"" – no.

This seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the word is S _ _ A _ with T in position 5, and another letter in position 2 or 3.

Let me try ""SMITH"" – but A is not in position 4.

I realize I'm stuck. Let me try ""STIAT"" even though it's uncommon, or think of ""STOAT"" but that has T in position 2 which is forbidden.

Wait, let me try ""STIAT"" – if it's accepted as a word (though rare), it fits:
- S T I A T – but T is in position 2 and 5, which contradicts T(-) from STAYS (T is in word but not in position 2).

This is very restrictive. The only remaining possibility is ""STIAT"" which seems invalid. This suggests I might have missed an earlier step.

Re-examining: from STAYS, S is in position 1 (✓), T is in word but not position 2, A is in word but not position 3 (consistent with it being in position 4), Y is out, and S is not in position 5 (consistent).

Possible valid words:

But since ""STIAT"" is invalid, this suggests an error in my reasoning. Let me try ""STOAT"" despite the T in position 2:

""STOAT"" – S T O A T
- S is in position 1 (✓).
- T is in position 2 (but feedback says T is in word but not in position 2) – contradiction.

Thus, no valid word seems to fit. This indicates I must have missed an earlier step.

Re-examining feedback:
From CRANE: C, R, N, E are out, A is in word but not position 3.
From SALAD: S is in position 1 (✓), A is in position 4 (✓).
From STAYS: T is in word but not position 2, A is in word but not position 3 (consistent).

Thus the word is S _ _ A _ with T in position 3 or 5.

Valid English words fitting this:

- ""SKALT"" – no.
- ""SHALT"" – no.
- ""SWALT"" – no.
- ""STALT"" – no.
- ""STIAT"" – no.
- ""STOAT"" – T in position 2 and 5, but position 2 is forbidden.

This is extremely restrictive. The only possible word I can think of is ""STIAT"", but it's not valid. This suggests I might have missed a word with T in position 5 and other letters.

Let me try ""SQUAT"" – but U is allowed, Q is allowed, but A is position 4, T is position 5.

""SQUAT"" – S Q U A T
- S in position 1 (✓).
- T in position 5 (allowed).
- A in position 4 (✓).
- Q and U are new letters, not yet ruled out.
- No forbidden letters.

This seems valid! I missed this earlier.

Let me verify:
- S is in position 1 (✓ from SALAD).
- A is in position 4 (✓ from SALAD).
- T is in position 5 (allowed by STAYS feedback: T is in word but not position 2).
- Q and U are new letters, not yet tested.

Thus, ""SQUAT"" is a valid next guess.Based on the feedback:
- S is locked in position 1.
- A is locked in position 4.
- T must appear somewhere (but not in position 2).
- Forbidden letters: C, R, N, E, L, D, Y.

The word has the form S _ _ A _ and must contain T. The only remaining valid English word fitting these constraints is ""SQUAT"" (S Q U A T).",Guess 4: SQUAT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) Q(✓) U(✓) A(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
