For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

One of the classic best-starting-words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This gives us a high chance of identifying which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(✓): R is in the word and in the correct position (second spot).
- O(x): O is NOT in the word.
- S(x): S is NOT in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So far we know:
- R is fixed in position 2.
- A and E are somewhere in the word but not in positions 1 or 5 respectively.
- O and S are out.

We need a word with:
- R in position 2.
- A and E somewhere else (positions 3,4 or 5 for A; positions 1,3,4 for E).
- No O or S.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to place A and E in new positions while introducing new common letters. A good candidate is ""DREAD"":
- R is in position 2 (✓ from feedback).
- A is in position 4 (new position).
- E is in position 3 (new position).
- D and D are new letters.
- No O or S.

This should help us narrow down positions for A and E and test new letters.
