For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-1 consonants to quickly identify which vowels are present. One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a high chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-1 consonants to quickly identify which vowels are present. One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a high chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(x), O(x), S(x): R, O, S are not in the word at all.
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct 5th position.

So far we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains A somewhere, but not in position 1.
3. It does NOT contain R, O, S.

Letters still possible: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding R, O, S).

A good next guess should:
- Keep E in position 5.
- Try to place A in positions 2-4 to test new spots.
- Include other common letters not yet ruled out.

A strong candidate is ""TALKE"":
- T: Common consonant, not yet tested.
- A: Tests if A is in position 2.
- L: Common consonant.
- K: Common consonant.
- E: Keeps the known E in position 5.

This gives us information about T, L, K and confirms where A is.

From the two guesses so far:

   - T and K are absent.
   - A is present but not in position 2.
   - L is present but not in position 3.
   - E is still in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains A (positions 2,3,4 ruled out; only 5 is allowed, but 5 is E, so A must be in 2,3,4 but feedback says it's not in 2, so A must be in 3 or 4).
- Contains L (not in position 3).
- Does not contain R, O, S, T, K.

Letters still possible: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding R,O,S,T,K).

We need a word ending with E, with A in 3 or 4, and L somewhere else (not 3).

Possible patterns:
- _ _ A _ E (A in 3)
- _ _ _ A E (A in 4)

And L must fit in one of the remaining positions (not 3).

Let's try ""PLANE"":
- P: new consonant.
- L: tests in position 1 (since L can't be in 3, this is acceptable).
- A: tests in position 3.
- N: new consonant.
- E: fixed in position 5.

This covers new letters P and N, and positions L in 1 and A in 3.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(x), O(x), S(x): R, O, S are not in the word at all.
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct 5th position.

So far we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains A somewhere, but not in position 1.
3. It does NOT contain R, O, S.

Letters still possible: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding R, O, S).

A good next guess should:
- Keep E in position 5.
- Try to place A in positions 2-4 to test new spots.
- Include other common letters not yet ruled out.

A strong candidate is ""TALKE"":
- T: Common consonant, not yet tested.
- A: Tests if A is in position 2.
- L: Common consonant.
- K: Common consonant.
- E: Keeps the known E in position 5.

This gives us information about T, L, K and confirms where A is.

   - A is present but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S are absent.

2. TALKE → T(x) A(-) L(-) K(x) E(✓)
   - T and K are absent.
   - A is present but not in position 2.
   - L is present but not in position 3.
   - E is still in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains A (positions 2,3,4 ruled out; only 5 is allowed, but 5 is E, so A must be in 2,3,4 but feedback says it's not in 2, so A must be in 3 or 4).
- Contains L (not in position 3).
- Does not contain R, O, S, T, K.

Letters still possible: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding R,O,S,T,K).

We need a word ending with E, with A in 3 or 4, and L somewhere else (not 3).

Possible patterns:
- _ _ A _ E (A in 3)
- _ _ _ A E (A in 4)

And L must fit in one of the remaining positions (not 3).

Let's try ""PLANE"":
- P: new consonant.
- L: tests in position 1 (since L can't be in 3, this is acceptable).
- A: tests in position 3.
- N: new consonant.
- E: fixed in position 5.

This covers new letters P and N, and positions L in 1 and A in 3.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   – E is fixed in position 5.
   – A is present but not in position 1.
   – R, O, S are absent.

2. TALKE → T(x) A(-) L(-) K(x) E(✓)
   – T, K are absent.
   – A is present but not in position 2.
   – L is present but not in position 3.

3. PLANE → P(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
   – P, N are absent.
   – L is in position 2 (✓).
   – A is in position 3 (✓).
   – E is in position 5 (✓).

So the pattern is now:  
_ L A _ E  
Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, T, K, P, N.

Remaining unused common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We need a 1st and 4th letter from these.

Simple choice that fits:  
B L A C E → uses B and C, both still allowed.

Current known pattern: _ L A _ E  
Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, T, K, P, N, B, C  
Still-valid consonants for first and fourth positions: D, F, G, H, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

We need a common word that fits _ L A _ E using only these remaining consonants.  
Scanning common English words of this pattern:  
- D L A _ E → DLAE is not a word.  
- F L A _ E → FLAE is not a word.  
- G L A _ E → GLAE is not a word.  
- H L A _ E → HLAE is not a word.  
- M L A _ E → MLA E is not a word.  
- V L A _ E → VLAE is not a word.  
- W L A _ E → WLAE is not a word.  

However, “GLADE” uses G, L, A, D, E.  
Check:  
- G is still allowed (not ruled out).  
- D is still allowed (not ruled out).  
- All letters fit the pattern _ L A _ E.  

Therefore, “GLADE” is the logical next guess.

Only remaining common consonant for the 4th position: F, H, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Looking for common 5-letter words ending in “E” with the pattern G L A _ E:
- GLAFE – not a valid word.
- GLAME – not a valid word.
- GLARE – but R is already ruled out.
- GLAZE – but Z is still allowed, and “GLAZE” is a valid word.

Check letters:
- G, L, A, Z, E: none are ruled out except D was ruled out, but Z wasn’t mentioned.
- Pattern fits: G L A Z E.

Therefore, the only remaining plausible word is “GLAZE”.
