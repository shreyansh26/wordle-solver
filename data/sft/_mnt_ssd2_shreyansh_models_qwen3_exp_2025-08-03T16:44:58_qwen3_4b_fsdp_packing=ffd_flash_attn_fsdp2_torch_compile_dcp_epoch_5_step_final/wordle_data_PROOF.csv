3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should ideally use 5 distinct letters from this set. 

Some popular strong starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRATE (C, R, A, T, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it covers 5 very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

So far we know:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) at position 2

Letters we can rule out: C, A, N, E
Letters we still consider: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Good next guesses should use new letters not yet tested while fitting the pattern. I’ll pick a word that:
1. Has R in position 2
2. Uses new common letters (I, S, T, L, O, etc.)
3. Avoids any ruled-out letters (C, A, N, E)

Some good candidates:
- BRISK (B, I, S, K) – but K is less common
- DRIFT (D, I, F, T) – good letters
- GRIST (G, I, S, T) – strong choice
- TRUST (T, U, S, T) – repeats T, which is okay but not ideal
- PROUD (P, O, U, D) – good letters

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should ideally use 5 distinct letters from this set. 

Some popular strong starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRATE (C, R, A, T, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it covers 5 very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Letters we can rule out: C, A, N, E
Letters we still consider: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Good next guesses should use new letters not yet tested while fitting the pattern. I’ll pick a word that:
1. Has R in position 2
2. Uses new common letters (I, S, T, L, O, etc.)
3. Avoids any ruled-out letters (C, A, N, E)

Some good candidates:
- BRISK (B, I, S, K) – but K is less common
- DRIFT (D, I, F, T) – good letters
- GRIST (G, I, S, T) – strong choice
- TRUST (T, U, S, T) – repeats T, which is okay but not ideal
- PROUD (P, O, U, D) – good letters

Good next guesses should use new letters not yet tested while fitting the pattern. I’ll pick a word that:
1. Has R in position 2
2. Uses new common letters (I, S, T, L, O, etc.)
3. Avoids any ruled-out letters (C, A, N, E)

Some good candidates:
- BRISK (B, I, S, K) – but K is less common
- DRIFT (D, I, F, T) – good letters
- GRIST (G, I, S, T) – strong choice
- TRUST (T, U, S, T) – repeats T, which is okay but not ideal
- PROUD (P, O, U, D) – good letters

I’ll go with ""GRIST"" as it uses very common letters (G, I, S, T) while fitting the pattern _ R _ _ _.

So far we know:
- C, A, N, E, G, I, S, T are NOT in the word.
- R is in the word and in position 2.

Word pattern: _ R _ _ _

Remaining unused common letters: B, D, F, H, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, Z

I need a word with R in position 2 that uses none of the eliminated letters. Good candidates:
- BRUDE – but D and E are eliminated.
- FROND – D and N are eliminated.
- HORNY – H, O, R, N, Y – N is eliminated.
- PROWL – P, O, W, L – all still possible.
- DROOL – D and O are possible, but D is eliminated.
- PRONG – P, N, G are eliminated.
- MORUL – M, O, U, L – all possible.

""PROWL"" uses P, O, W, L – none of which are eliminated. It also has common letters and no repeats.

Another check: no C, A, N, E, G, I, S, T in PROWL – correct.

Thus, PROWL is a good next guess.

We now know:
- Letters in word: P, R, O (all marked ✓)
- Positions: P is 1st, R is 2nd, O is 3rd
- Letters NOT in word: C, A, N, E, G, I, S, T, W, L

So the pattern is: P R O _ _

Remaining unused common letters (from the alphabet excluding the known-absent ones):
B, D, F, H, K, M, U, V, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that starts with PRO and uses any of these remaining letters in the 4th and 5th positions.

Possible combinations:
- PRO + B + Y = PROBY (not a word)
- PRO + D + Y = PRODY (not a word)
- PRO + K + Y = PROKY (not a word)
- PRO + M + Y = PROMY (not a word)
- PRO + U + Y = PROUY (not a word)
- PRO + V + Y = PROVY (not a word)
- PRO + K + K = PROKK (not a word)
- PRO + M + M = PROMM (not a word)

Looking at actual English words starting with PRO:
- PROUD (D is unused, U is unused) – but D is unused and U is unused, so this fits
- PROWL – already tried
- PROXY – X and Y are possible, but X is less common
- PROBE – B and E – E is already excluded
- PROUD uses D and U, both still possible.

Let me check: PROUD has letters P, R, O, U, D – none of which are in the excluded list.

Another option: PROXY – P, R, O, X, Y – X and Y haven't been tested yet.

Between these, PROUD seems most likely because it uses common remaining letters (D and U).

Let me confirm: 
- PROUD: P(✓), R(✓), O(✓), U(possible), D(possible) – no conflicts with previous feedback.

Thus, the next guess should be PROUD.

We now know:
- Letters in word: P, R, O (positions 1-3 fixed)
- Letters NOT in word: C, A, N, E, G, I, S, T, W, L, U, D

Remaining unused common letters (from the alphabet excluding the known-absent ones):

We need a 5-letter word that starts with PRO and uses any of these remaining letters in the 4th and 5th positions.

Looking at actual English words starting with PRO:
- PROB... – no common 5-letter words
- PROK... – no
- PROH... – no
- PROB... – none
- PROXY – uses X and Y, both still possible
- PROV... – no common words
- PROK... – no
- PROB... – no

The only common English word that fits is PROXY, which uses P, R, O, X, Y – none of which are in the excluded list.

Thus, the next logical guess is PROXY.
