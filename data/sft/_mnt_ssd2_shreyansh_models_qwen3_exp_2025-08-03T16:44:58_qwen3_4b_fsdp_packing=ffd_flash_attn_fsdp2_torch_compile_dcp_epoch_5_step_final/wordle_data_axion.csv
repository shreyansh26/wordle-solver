For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically contain a mix of vowels and common consonants. 

Some of the most recommended starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ADIEU
- RAISE

Looking at these options, I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has:
- C, R: very common consonants
- A: a common vowel
- N, E: other common letters

This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically contain a mix of vowels and common consonants. 

Some of the most recommended starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ADIEU
- RAISE

Looking at these options, I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has:
- C, R: very common consonants
- A: a common vowel
- N, E: other common letters

This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) – C is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: C, R, E
- Letters definitely present: A, N
- A is not in position 3
- N is not in position 4

I need a word that:
1. Contains A and N
2. Does not contain C, R, E
3. A is not in position 3
4. N is not in position 4

I’ll look for a word that satisfies these constraints and also uses other common letters to gather more information.

<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback for Guess 2 (ANIMAL) says “Model answer is not five letters,” so ANIMAL is not considered a valid 5-letter word for this game.  
I need to pick another 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and N (from Guess 1 feedback)  
- Does not contain C, R, E (also from Guess 1 feedback)  
- Has A not in position 3  
- Has N not in position 4  

Possible common 5-letter words that fit:
- NATION (but has T, I, O)  
- DANGL (not a valid word)  
- PANEL (but has E, which is invalid)  
- SANDY (but lacks N)  
- VANAL (not a valid word)  
- LANKY (but lacks A)  
- NINJA (but lacks A)  
- AULIC (but lacks N)  

Looking again, a valid word is “NATION” (N-A-T-I-O-N), but it has N in position 5, which is allowed (only position 4 is excluded).  
Another valid word is “VANAL” (but not valid).  
Another is “SALON” (but lacks N).  

A valid word that fits all constraints is “SALON” (S-A-L-O-N):
- Contains A and N  
- Does not contain C, R, E  
- A is in position 2 (not 3)  
- N is in position 5 (not 4)  

This seems good.

Let’s carefully update what we now know after all four guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (✗): C, R, E, S, L, M  
Letters definitely IN the word (✓): A, N, I  
Positional information so far:
1. A – must be in position 1 (because Guess 4 shows A in position 1 is correct)  
2. N – must be in position 3 (because it cannot sit in 4, 5, or 2 and position 1 is already A)  
3. I – must be in position 3 (from Guess 4)  
4. O – must be in position 4 (from Guess 3)  
5. The remaining slot (position 5) can only contain letters we have not yet ruled out.

But wait: positions 2 and 3 both cannot be occupied by the same letter.  
From Guess 4: A(✓) N(-) I(✓) M(x) A(-)  
- A is correct in position 1.  
- I is correct in position 3.  
- N is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- M is not in the word.  
- The final A is in the word but not in position 5 (so it must be in 2 or 3, but 3 is already I).  
Hence the second A must be in position 2.

So the pattern is now:
1: A  
2: A  
3: I  
4: O  
5: ? (must be a letter we have not yet ruled out and must appear only once)

Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits A A I O _.

The only common English word that fits is “AAIO_” – but none of the letters B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z form a valid word in position 5.  
However, one letter does stand out: “AAIO_” with Y in position 5 gives “AAIOY” – which is not a valid word.  
But wait, the letter “K” gives “AAIOK” – also invalid.  
The letter “T” gives “AAIOT” – invalid.  
The letter “D” gives “AAIOD” – invalid.  
The letter “P” gives “AAIOP” – invalid.  
The letter “B” gives “AAIOB” – invalid.  
The letter “G” gives “AAIOG” – invalid.  
The letter “H” gives “AAIOH” – invalid.  
The letter “F” gives “AAIOF” – invalid.  
The letter “U” gives “AAIOU” – invalid.  
The letter “V” gives “AAIOV” – invalid.  
The letter “W” gives “AAIOW” – invalid.  
The letter “X” gives “AAIOX” – invalid.  
The letter “Y” gives “AAIOY” – invalid.  
The letter “Z” gives “AAIOZ” – invalid.

This implies we must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.  
Re-examining Guess 4: ANIMA -> A(✓) N(-) I(✓) M(x) A(-)  
- The first A is ✓ in position 1.  
- N is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- I is ✓ in position 3.  
- M is not in the word.  
- The final A is in the word but NOT in position 5.  

So the word must contain:
- A in position 1  
- I in position 3  
- O in position 4  
- N somewhere (positions 1,3,4,5) but 1,3,4 are taken, so N must be in position 5.  

Hence the pattern is:
1: A  
2: ? (must be a letter we have not ruled out and must appear once)  
3: I  
4: O  
5: N  

Letters still allowed in position 2: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We need a valid 5-letter word that fits A _ I O N.  
The only common English word that fits is “ATION” – but A is already in position 1, and “ATION” starts with A, so the word would be A + TION = “ATION” – but that’s only 5 letters and starts with A.  
However, the pattern we have is A _ I O N, so the word must be A T I O N – but that’s 5 letters and starts with A.  
But we already have A in position 1, so the word would be A T I O N – but that’s 5 letters and starts with A, which matches our pattern.  

But wait, the word “ATION” is valid (as in “addition”), and it fits:
A T I O N  
- A in 1 (✓)  
- I in 3 (✓)  
- O in 4 (✓)  
- N in 5 (must be true)  
- T is new and allowed.  

So the next guess is “ATION”.

Letters NOT in the word (✗): C, R, E, S, L, M  
Letters definitely IN the word (✓): A, N, I  
Positional information so far:
1. A – must be in position 1 (because Guess 4 shows A in position 1 is correct)  
2. N – must be in position 3 (because it cannot sit in 4, 5, or 2 and position 1 is already A)  
3. I – must be in position 3 (from Guess 4)  
4. O – must be in position 4 (from Guess 3)  
5. The remaining slot (position 5) can only contain letters we have not yet ruled out.

But wait: positions 2 and 3 both cannot be occupied by the same letter.  
From Guess 4: A(✓) N(-) I(✓) M(x) A(-)  
- A is correct in position 1.  
- I is correct in position 3.  
- N is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- M is not in the word.  
- The final A is in the word but not in position 5 (so it must be in 2 or 3, but 3 is already I).  
Hence the second A must be in position 2.

So the pattern is now:
1: A  
2: A  
3: I  
4: O  
5: ? (must be a letter we have not yet ruled out and must appear only once)

Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits A A I O _.

The only common English word that fits is “AAIO_” – but none of the letters B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z form a valid word in position 5.  
However, one letter does stand out: “AAIO_” with Y in position 5 gives “AAIOY” – which is not a valid word.  
But wait, the letter “K” gives “AAIOK” – also invalid.  
The letter “T” gives “AAIOT” – invalid.  
The letter “D” gives “AAIOD” – invalid.  
The letter “P” gives “AAIOP” – invalid.  
The letter “B” gives “AAIOB” – invalid.  
The letter “G” gives “AAIOG” – invalid.  
The letter “H” gives “AAIOH” – invalid.  
The letter “F” gives “AAIOF” – invalid.  
The letter “U” gives “AAIOU” – invalid.  
The letter “V” gives “AAIOV” – invalid.  
The letter “W” gives “AAIOW” – invalid.  
The letter “X” gives “AAIOX” – invalid.  
The letter “Y” gives “AAIOY” – invalid.  
The letter “Z” gives “AAIOZ” – invalid.

This implies we must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.  
Re-examining Guess 4: ANIMA -> A(✓) N(-) I(✓) M(x) A(-)  
- The first A is ✓ in position 1.  
- N is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- I is ✓ in position 3.  
- M is not in the word.  
- The final A is in the word but NOT in position 5.  

So the word must contain:
- A in position 1  
- I in position 3  
- O in position 4  
- N somewhere (positions 1,3,4,5) but 1,3,4 are taken, so N must be in position 5.  

Hence the pattern is:
1: A  
2: ? (must be a letter we have not ruled out and must appear once)  
3: I  
4: O  
5: N  

Letters still allowed in position 2: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We need a valid 5-letter word that fits A _ I O N.  
The only common English word that fits is “ATION” – but A is already in position 1, and “ATION” starts with A, so the word would be A + TION = “ATION” – but that’s only 5 letters and starts with A.  
However, the pattern we have is A _ I O N, so the word must be A T I O N – but that’s 5 letters and starts with A.  
But we already have A in position 1, so the word would be A T I O N – but that’s 5 letters and starts with A, which matches our pattern.  

But wait, the word “ATION” is valid (as in “addition”), and it fits:
A T I O N  
- A in 1 (✓)  
- I in 3 (✓)  
- O in 4 (✓)  
- N in 5 (must be true)  
- T is new and allowed.  

So the next guess is “ATION”.",Guess 5: ATION -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) T(x) I(✓) O(✓) N(✓),FAIL

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically contain a mix of vowels and common consonants. 

Some of the most recommended starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ADIEU
- RAISE

Looking at these options, I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has:
- C, R: very common consonants
- A: a common vowel
- N, E: other common letters

This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) – C is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: C, R, E
- Letters definitely present: A, N
- A is not in position 3
- N is not in position 4

I need a word that:
1. Contains A and N
2. Does not contain C, R, E
3. A is not in position 3
4. N is not in position 4

I’ll look for a word that satisfies these constraints and also uses other common letters to gather more information.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: ANIMAL -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback for Guess 2 (ANIMAL) says “Model answer is not five letters,” so ANIMAL is not considered a valid 5-letter word for this game.  
I need to pick another 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and N (from Guess 1 feedback)  
- Does not contain C, R, E (also from Guess 1 feedback)  
- Has A not in position 3  
- Has N not in position 4  

Possible common 5-letter words that fit:
- NATION (but has T, I, O)  
- DANGL (not a valid word)  
- PANEL (but has E, which is invalid)  
- SANDY (but lacks N)  
- VANAL (not a valid word)  
- LANKY (but lacks A)  
- NINJA (but lacks A)  
- AULIC (but lacks N)  

Looking again, a valid word is “NATION” (N-A-T-I-O-N), but it has N in position 5, which is allowed (only position 4 is excluded).  
Another valid word is “VANAL” (but not valid).  
Another is “SALON” (but lacks N).  

A valid word that fits all constraints is “SALON” (S-A-L-O-N):
- Contains A and N  
- Does not contain C, R, E  
- A is in position 2 (not 3)  
- N is in position 5 (not 4)  

This seems good.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: ANIMAL -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 3: SALON -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(-) L(x) O(✓) N(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. Letters NOT in the word: C, R, E, S, L  
2. Letters definitely IN the word: A, N  
3. Positional clues:
   - A is NOT in positions 2 or 3  
   - N is NOT in positions 4 or 5  
   - O is in position 4 (✓)  
   - So N must be in position 1 or 2 (since 3,4,5 are excluded)  
   - A must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (since 2,3 are excluded) but position 4 is already O, so A must be in position 1 or 5  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and N  
- Does not contain C, R, E, S, L  
- Has O in position 4  
- Places N in position 1 or 2  
- Places A in position 1 or 5  

Let’s test possibilities:
- If N is in position 1 and A is in position 5: N _ _ O A  
  Possible letters for positions 2,3: must be from remaining unused consonants (D, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z) and must form a valid word.  
  “NATION” fits: N A T I O N → but A is in position 2 (invalid, A cannot be in 2)  
  “NODIA” – not a valid word.  
  “NOMIA” – not valid.  
  “NOVA” – too short.  

- If N is in position 2 and A is in position 1: A N _ O _  
  Possible word: “ANODE” – but E is invalid.  
  “ANGEL” – E and L invalid.  
  “ANIMA” – M, I allowed, but A is in position 5 (valid), N in 2 (valid).  
  Check constraints:  
  – Contains A (position 1) and N (position 2) ✔  
  – No C, R, E, S, L ✔  
  – O in position 4 ✔  
  – A not in 2 or 3 ✔ (it’s in 1)  
  – N not in 4 or 5 ✔ (it’s in 2)  

“ANIMA” is a valid 5-letter word and satisfies all constraints.

Let’s carefully update what we now know after all four guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (✗): C, R, E, S, L, M  
Letters definitely IN the word (✓): A, N, I  
Positional information so far:
1. A – must be in position 1 (because Guess 4 shows A in position 1 is correct)  
2. N – must be in position 3 (because it cannot sit in 4, 5, or 2 and position 1 is already A)  
3. I – must be in position 3 (from Guess 4)  
4. O – must be in position 4 (from Guess 3)  
5. The remaining slot (position 5) can only contain letters we have not yet ruled out.

But wait: positions 2 and 3 both cannot be occupied by the same letter.  
From Guess 4: A(✓) N(-) I(✓) M(x) A(-)  
- A is correct in position 1.  
- I is correct in position 3.  
- N is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- M is not in the word.  
- The final A is in the word but not in position 5 (so it must be in 2 or 3, but 3 is already I).  
Hence the second A must be in position 2.

So the pattern is now:
1: A  
2: A  
3: I  
4: O  
5: ? (must be a letter we have not yet ruled out and must appear only once)

Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits A A I O _.

The only common English word that fits is “AAIO_” – but none of the letters B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z form a valid word in position 5.  
However, one letter does stand out: “AAIO_” with Y in position 5 gives “AAIOY” – which is not a valid word.  
But wait, the letter “K” gives “AAIOK” – also invalid.  
The letter “T” gives “AAIOT” – invalid.  
The letter “D” gives “AAIOD” – invalid.  
The letter “P” gives “AAIOP” – invalid.  
The letter “B” gives “AAIOB” – invalid.  
The letter “G” gives “AAIOG” – invalid.  
The letter “H” gives “AAIOH” – invalid.  
The letter “F” gives “AAIOF” – invalid.  
The letter “U” gives “AAIOU” – invalid.  
The letter “V” gives “AAIOV” – invalid.  
The letter “W” gives “AAIOW” – invalid.  
The letter “X” gives “AAIOX” – invalid.  
The letter “Y” gives “AAIOY” – invalid.  
The letter “Z” gives “AAIOZ” – invalid.

This implies we must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.  
Re-examining Guess 4: ANIMA -> A(✓) N(-) I(✓) M(x) A(-)

- N is in the word but NOT in position 2.

We now have:

Position 1: A (fixed ✓)  
Position 2: must be a letter that appears exactly once among all letters used so far and has not been ruled out.  
Position 3: I (fixed ✓)  
Position 4: O (fixed ✓)  
Position 5: N (fixed ✓)

Letters already shown or ruled out:
- Definitely present: A, I, O, N  
- Definitely absent: C, R, E, S, L, M, T

So position 2 must be one of the remaining unused letters that is also not C, R, E, S, L, M, T.  
Valid choices left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a real 5-letter English word of the form A _ I O N.

Checking each candidate:
- A B I O N → “ABION” – not a valid word.
- A D I O N → “ADION” – not valid.
- A F I O N → “AFION” – not valid.
- A G I O N → “AGION” – not valid.
- A H I O N → “AHION” – not valid.
- A K I O N → “AKION” – not valid.
- A P I O N → “APION” – not valid.
- A V I O N → “AVION” – valid (French for “airplane,” recognized in English Scrabble dictionaries).

Hence the only common English word that fits is “AVION”.
