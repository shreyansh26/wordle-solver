### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that gives me maximum information. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. The goal is to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters. 

One classic and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common middle letter)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to work with for subsequent guesses.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that gives me maximum information. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. The goal is to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters. 

One classic and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common middle letter)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to work with for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- L(x) – L is NOT in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong place (not position 3).
- T(x) – T is NOT in the word.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains the letter A somewhere (but not in position 3).
- The word does NOT contain S, L, T, or E.

I want a new guess that:
1. Includes A (but not in position 3).
2. Avoids S, L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Common remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, H, B, G, F, K, V, W, Y, Z.

Common vowels: I, O, U.

I’ll try to pick a word that uses A in a different position and introduces other common letters not yet tested.

A good candidate is “RANCH”:
- R – common consonant, not yet tested.
- A – in the word but not in position 3 (we’ll place it at position 2).
- N – common consonant, not yet tested.
- C – common consonant, not yet tested.
- H – common consonant, not yet tested.

This avoids S, L, T, E and tests several new letters.

Current knowledge:

- Letters confirmed IN the word:
  – A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
  – R is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).

So far the pattern looks like: _ A _ _ _

We also know R must appear somewhere in positions 3, 4 or 5.

Available letters (excluding the eliminated ones): A, B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need:
1. A in position 2.
2. R somewhere else (positions 3, 4, or 5).
3. Two more distinct letters from the remaining pool.

I want to test new common letters while placing R in different positions. Let’s try “MARRY”:
- M – new consonant.
- A – confirmed in position 2.
- R – will be in position 3 (checking if R is in position 3).
- R – duplicate R is allowed in Wordle, and we’re testing if R appears twice.
- Y – new letter.

This guess uses A in the correct spot, places R in position 3, and introduces M and Y which haven’t been tested yet.

1. Pattern: M A _ O R  (positions 1-2-4-5 are fixed)
2. Letters already placed: M, A, O, R
3. Letters known NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, N, C, H, G, D, K, P, B, F, W, V, X, Z, Q, J, and also I and U have been eliminated because they weren’t present in any feedback.

That leaves only one possible letter for position 3: Y (since all other common letters have been ruled out).

So the only remaining word that fits is M A Y O R.
