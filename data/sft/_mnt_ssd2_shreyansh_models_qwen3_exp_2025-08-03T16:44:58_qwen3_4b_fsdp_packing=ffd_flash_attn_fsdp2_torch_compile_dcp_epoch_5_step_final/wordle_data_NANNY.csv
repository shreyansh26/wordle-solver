### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters and tests vowels in multiple positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be in position 1).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A somewhere, but not in the first position.
- Does not contain R, O, S, E.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps A but moves it to a new position.
2. Introduces several fresh common letters to maximize information.
3. Avoids R, O, S, E.

A good set of fresh common letters is T, I, N, L, U, C, Y, D, H, M, etc. I’ll pick a word that places A in position 2 or 3 and adds several of these new letters.

“TAINT” is a candidate: T, A, I, N, T. It moves A to position 2, introduces T, I, N, and avoids the forbidden letters.

Another candidate is “PAINT” but P is less common than T. “FAINT” introduces F, which is less common than T. “VAINT” is not a valid word. “WAIST” uses W, I, S, T but S is forbidden. So “TAINT” seems the best.

I’ll go with “TAINT”.

Step 1 – summarize what we now know  
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, T, I, C, L  
- Letters confirmed in the word and in the correct positions:  
  – A is in position 2  
  – N is in position 3  

So the pattern is fixed at: _ A N _ _

Step 2 – determine which letters are still available  
From the alphabet we remove: R, O, S, E, T, I, C, L  
Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Among these, the most common five that have not been tested yet are B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P.

Step 3 – pick a valid 5-letter word that matches _ A N _ _ and uses only untested letters  
Scanning the pattern, common words that fit:  
- BANAL (but L already ruled out) → invalid  
- DANGY → uses D, A, N, G, Y  (all still possible)  
- FANGY → F, A, N, G, Y  (valid)  
- GANJA (J not yet ruled out but less common)  
- HANGB → invalid (not a word)  
- MANGY → M, A, N, G, Y  (valid)  
- PANGY → P, A, N, G, Y  (valid)  

The simplest, most common word among these is “MANGY”. It uses M, A, N, G, Y, all of which have not been eliminated.

Therefore, the next logical guess is MANGY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these high-frequency letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters and tests vowels in multiple positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be in position 1).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A somewhere, but not in the first position.
- Does not contain R, O, S, E.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps A but moves it to a new position.
2. Introduces several fresh common letters to maximize information.
3. Avoids R, O, S, E.

A good set of fresh common letters is T, I, N, L, U, C, Y, D, H, M, etc. I’ll pick a word that places A in position 2 or 3 and adds several of these new letters.

“TAINT” is a candidate: T, A, I, N, T. It moves A to position 2, introduces T, I, N, and avoids the forbidden letters.

Another candidate is “PAINT” but P is less common than T. “FAINT” introduces F, which is less common than T. “VAINT” is not a valid word. “WAIST” uses W, I, S, T but S is forbidden. So “TAINT” seems the best.

I’ll go with “TAINT”.

2. Letters **confirmed** in the word and in the correct positions:  
   - A in position 2

So the pattern so far is:  
_ A _ N _

We need three more letters.  
Good remaining common letters are: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

I want a word that:
- Places A and N in the already-correct spots.
- Introduces several new, high-frequency letters in the remaining three positions.

Candidate words that fit _ A _ N _ and use only still-possible letters:
- BANAL

- GANJA (but J is uncommon)

From the feedback so far:

- Letters **not** in the word: R, O, S, E, T, I, C, L, M, G  
- Letters **confirmed** in the word and in the correct positions:  
  – A in position 2  
  – N in position 3  
  – Y in position 5  

So the pattern is: _ A N _ Y

We still need letters for positions 1 and 4.  
Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Among these, the most common English letters that haven’t been tested are B, D, F, H, K, P.

Let’s look for real 5-letter words that fit _ A N _ Y:

- BANBY – invalid (B twice)  
- DANGY – invalid (G already ruled out)  
- FANBY – invalid  
- HANBY – invalid  
- JANBY – invalid  
- KANBY – invalid  
- PANBY – invalid  
- BANDY – uses B, A, N, D, Y (all valid)  
- FANLY – invalid (L ruled out)  
- HANDY – uses H, A, N, D, Y (all valid)  
- PANDY – invalid (D and Y already confirmed positions)  
- WANDY – uses W, A, N, D, Y  

“WANDY” is a valid word and uses W, A, N, D, Y.  
“BANDY” is also valid, but W is slightly more common in this pattern.

I’ll choose WANDY as it’s a common word and tests W and D.
