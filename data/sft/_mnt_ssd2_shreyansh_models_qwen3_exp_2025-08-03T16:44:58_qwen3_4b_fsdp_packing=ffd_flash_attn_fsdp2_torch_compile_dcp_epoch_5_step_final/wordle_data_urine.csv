For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C appear most frequently in English words, so a good starting word should include several of these.

After considering options like ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", ""STARE"", ""RAISE"", and ""AROSE"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has a good vowel-consonant balance.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(✓) – R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth letter).

So we know:
- Word is of the form _ R _ _ E
- Cannot contain A, O, or S
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels to try: I, U (since A and O are ruled out)

Let’s pick a word that keeps R and E fixed, uses new letters, and avoids A/O/S.  
A good candidate is ""URINE"":
- U and I are new vowels.
- N is a common consonant.
- It fits the pattern _ R _ _ E (URINE → U R I N E).
