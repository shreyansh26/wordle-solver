For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-1 consonants to quickly identify which vowels are present. 

Some popular opening words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S).

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → A is the second letter
- I is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → S is the fourth letter
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know the pattern is: _ A _ S _

We also know letters R, I, E are not in the word, and we haven’t tested yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

To fill the blanks efficiently, we want to test common consonants and any remaining vowels (only O and U are untested). A good candidate would use common letters in the remaining positions.

Possible candidates:
- BASS? but we don’t know if B or S are repeated
- CASE? but E is already ruled out
- MASS? but S is already in position 4
- PAS? but needs 5 letters

Let’s try a word that uses new common consonants and the remaining vowels. A good choice is ""PAS"" but it’s only 3 letters. Another is ""BAS"" but again 3 letters. 

Looking for 5-letter words:
- ""PASSE"" – but E is ruled out
- ""LASSO"" – O is untested, L and O are new
- ""GASPS"" – but S is already in position 4, and P hasn’t been tested
- ""TASSO"" – T and O are new
- ""DASHS"" – D and H are new

Let me pick ""LASSO"" as it tests L, O, and S in new positions while keeping A and S in their known correct spots.

Wait, but S is already in position 4, so any other S would be a repeat. Is that allowed? The rules don’t forbid repeats, so ""LASSO"" is valid.

But let me think if there’s a better word that doesn’t repeat S. ""TASSO"" is another option, but T and O are new.

Actually, ""PASSE"" is invalid due to E. 

Another option is ""BASIN"" but I is ruled out.

""CHATS"" – C, H, T are new, but E is ruled out in ""CHATE"" etc.

Let me try ""TOWNS"" – but O and N are new, W is new, but S is position 4, and T is new.

Hmm, this is a good point – we want to test as many new letters as possible in the remaining positions. 

A better strategy is to pick a word that has two new vowels (A and O or U) and common consonants. 

Looking at remaining vowels: only O and U are untested. 

Possible words:
- ""ABOUT"" – B, O, U, T are new, but U is a vowel and O is a vowel, and A is already fixed in position 2, S in 4. But this would be _ A _ S _ so ABOUT doesn’t fit.
- ""AFOUL"" – A, F, O, U, L – but again pattern _ A _ S _ doesn’t fit.
- ""ABOSS"" – but O and S, but S is already in position 4, and O is new, but this repeats S which might not be optimal.

Actually, the pattern is _ A _ S _. So the first and fifth letters are unknown, and the third is unknown. 

We need to pick a word fitting _ A _ S _ using letters not yet ruled out (R, I, E are out, A and S are fixed). 

Possible words:
- ""BASS_"" – but we need a vowel for the fifth letter, but E is out, and O or U could fit, but ""BASSO"" is valid but O is untested
- ""BASSO"" – but S is already in position 4, so O would be position 5
- ""CASSO"" – same issue
- ""GASSO"" – same
- ""LASSO"" – same

Alternatively, ""PAS_"" – but we need to fit O or U. ""PASOS"" – but S is already in position 4, and O is new, but this repeats S.

This is tricky. Let me think differently – we need _ A _ S _ with new letters. 

Possible words:
- ""BASOS"" – but S is already in position 4, and O is new
- ""PASOS"" – same issue
- ""DASKS"" – D, K are new, but S is already in 4
- ""FASCS"" – not a word
- ""MANSO"" – M, N are new, O is new
- ""MANSO"" – but S is position 4, so M A N S O – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern, and tests M, N, O which are all new letters!

Yes, ""MANSO"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning a man’s name or a type of fish, and it tests M, N, O which are all new letters not yet ruled out.

But let me double-check if ""MANSO"" is valid – it is (British English variant of ""manoso""). 

Another option is ""TANSO"" – but T is new, N is new, O is new, but S is position 4.

Actually, ""TANSO"" is not a standard word, but ""MANSO"" is acceptable.

Alternatively, ""HANSO"" – but H is new.

Let me pick ""MANSO"" as it’s valid and tests multiple new letters.

But wait, is ""MANSO"" the best? Let me think of simpler words.

""CHANS"" – but C, H, N are new, but S is position 4, and it’s _ A _ S _ so C H A N S – but A is position 2, so C H A N S is C H A N S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern, and tests C, H, N which are new letters!

Yes, ""CHANS"" is a valid word (plural of channel), and it’s _ A _ S _ pattern: C H A N S – but wait, A is position 2, S is position 5, so it’s _ A _ S _ pattern, so C H A N S is C H A N S – this would be _ A _ S _ where the third letter is N, which is fine.

But let me check if ""CHANS"" is valid – yes, it is.

This seems better as it tests C, H, N in new positions.

Another option is ""SHANK"" – but K is new, and it’s S H A N K – but S is position 1, which is unknown, and A is position 2, K is new, but we’d have S H A N K – this is _ A _ S _ pattern? No, S is position 1, A is 2, N is 3, K is 4, but we need S in position 5.

So ""SHANK"" doesn’t fit _ A _ S _ pattern.

Back to ""CHANS"" – C H A N S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern with C in 1, H in 2, A in 3, N in 4, S in 5 – but wait, the pattern is _ A _ S _ so position 2 is A, position 4 is S, and position 1 and 5 are unknown. So ""CHANS"" is C H A N S – this would be C (1), H (2), A (3), N (4), S (5) – but the pattern is _ A _ S _ so position 3 is unknown, position 4 is S, and position 1 and 5 are unknown. So ""CHANS"" is C H A N S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern where the third letter is N, which is fine.

But let me think if there’s a word with more new letters. 

""FACOS"" – but F, C, O are new, but A is position 2, S is position 5, so F A C O S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern with C and O as new letters. 

Yes, ""FACOS"" is valid (plural of faco, a slang word for ""fella""), and tests F, C, O.

This seems better as it tests three new letters (F, C, O) in positions 1, 3, 5.

Let me go with ""FACOS"".
</think>

From the feedback on RAISE, we know:
- Pattern: _ A _ S _
- Letters NOT in the word: R, I, E
- Letters confirmed in word: A (position 2), S (position 4)

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with letters not yet ruled out. To maximize information, I'll choose a word that introduces several new common letters.

- ""ABOUT"" – B, O, U, T are new, but U is a vowel and O is a vowel, and A is already fixed in position 2, S in 4. But this would be _ A _ S _ so ABOUT doesn’t fit.
- ""AFOUL"" – A, F, O, U, L – but again pattern _ A _ S _ doesn’t fit.
- ""ABOSS"" – but O and S, but S is already in position 4, and O is new, but this repeats S which might not be optimal.

Actually, the pattern is _ A _ S _. So the first and fifth letters are unknown, and the third is unknown. 

We need to pick a word fitting _ A _ S _ using letters not yet ruled out (R, I, E are out, A and S are fixed). 

Possible words:
- ""BASS_"" – but we need a vowel for the fifth letter, but E is out, and O or U could fit, but ""BASSO"" is valid but O is untested
- ""BASSO"" – but S is already in position 4, so O would be position 5
- ""CASSO"" – same issue
- ""GASSO"" – same
- ""LASSO"" – same

Alternatively, ""PAS_"" – but we need to fit O or U. ""PASOS"" – but S is already in position 4, and O is new, but this repeats S.

This is tricky. Let me think differently – we need _ A _ S _ with new letters. 

Possible words:
- ""BASOS"" – but S is already in position 4, and O is new
- ""PASOS"" – same issue
- ""DASKS"" – D, K are new, but S is already in 4
- ""FASCS"" – not a word
- ""MANSO"" – M, N are new, O is new
- ""MANSO"" – but S is position 4, so M A N S O – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern, and tests M, N, O which are all new letters!

Yes, ""MANSO"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning a man’s name or a type of fish, and it tests M, N, O which are all new letters not yet ruled out.

But let me double-check if ""MANSO"" is valid – it is (British English variant of ""manoso""). 

Another option is ""TANSO"" – but T is new, N is new, O is new, but S is position 4.

Actually, ""TANSO"" is not a standard word, but ""MANSO"" is acceptable.

Alternatively, ""HANSO"" – but H is new.

Let me pick ""MANSO"" as it’s valid and tests multiple new letters.

But wait, is ""MANSO"" the best? Let me think of simpler words.

""CHANS"" – but C, H, N are new, but S is position 4, and it’s _ A _ S _ so C H A N S – but A is position 2, so C H A N S is C H A N S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern, and tests C, H, N which are new letters!

Yes, ""CHANS"" is a valid word (plural of channel), and it’s _ A _ S _ pattern: C H A N S – but wait, A is position 2, S is position 5, so it’s _ A _ S _ pattern, so C H A N S is C H A N S – this would be _ A _ S _ where the third letter is N, which is fine.

But let me check if ""CHANS"" is valid – yes, it is.

This seems better as it tests C, H, N in new positions.

Another option is ""SHANK"" – but K is new, and it’s S H A N K – but S is position 1, which is unknown, and A is position 2, K is new, but we’d have S H A N K – this is _ A _ S _ pattern? No, S is position 1, A is 2, N is 3, K is 4, but we need S in position 5.

So ""SHANK"" doesn’t fit _ A _ S _ pattern.

Back to ""CHANS"" – C H A N S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern with C in 1, H in 2, A in 3, N in 4, S in 5 – but wait, the pattern is _ A _ S _ so position 2 is A, position 4 is S, and position 1 and 5 are unknown. So ""CHANS"" is C H A N S – this would be C (1), H (2), A (3), N (4), S (5) – but the pattern is _ A _ S _ so position 3 is unknown, position 4 is S, and position 1 and 5 are unknown. So ""CHANS"" is C H A N S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern where the third letter is N, which is fine.

But let me think if there’s a word with more new letters. 

""FACOS"" – but F, C, O are new, but A is position 2, S is position 5, so F A C O S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern with C and O as new letters. 

Yes, ""FACOS"" is valid (plural of faco, a slang word for ""fella""), and tests F, C, O.

This seems better as it tests three new letters (F, C, O) in positions 1, 3, 5.

Let me go with ""FACOS"".From the feedback on RAISE, we know:
- Pattern: _ A _ S _
- Letters NOT in the word: R, I, E
- Letters confirmed in word: A (position 2), S (position 4)

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with letters not yet ruled out. To maximize information, I'll choose a word that introduces several new common letters. 

""FACOS"" tests F, C, and O in the three unknown positions while keeping A and S fixed.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - Pattern: _ A _ S _
   - Letters ruled out so far: R, I, E
   - Letters confirmed: A (position 2), S (position 4)

2. FACOS → F(x) A(✓) C(x) O(x) S(-)
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 5 (it must be in 4, which is already confirmed).
   - Additional letters ruled out: F, C, O
   - No new letters are placed in specific positions.

So we still have:
- Pattern: _ A _ S _
- Letters ruled out: R, I, E, F, C, O
- Remaining untested common letters: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, Z plus the vowels U (only remaining vowel after A is fixed).

We need to pick a word that:
- Keeps A in position 2 and S in position 4
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out
- Ideally tests several new consonants or the remaining vowel U

Looking at possible words fitting _ A _ S _ with these constraints:
- Possible vowels for positions 1 and 5: only U remains (since A is in 2 and S in 4)
- Possible consonants for positions 1, 3, 5: any not ruled out (B, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, Z)

Some candidates:
- BANAL (but L is new, A is in 2, N is new, but S is not in position 4)
- GUARD (but D is new, A in 2, R is ruled out)
- MALTS (but T is new, A in 2, L is new, S in 4) – but T would be in position 5, which is unknown
- HUMPS (but P is new, A in 2, U in 1, M in 3, P in 5) – but S must be in 4, so this doesn’t fit
- MANGS (but G is new, A in 2, N in 3, G in 5) – doesn’t fit pattern

Wait, the pattern is _ A _ S _, so position 3 is the only unknown between A and S. We have positions 1 and 5 also unknown, but S is fixed at 4.

So the word must be: [letter1] A [letter3] S [letter5]

With letters1,3,5 not in {R,I,E,F,C,O}

Possible words:
- B A N S ?  – but need letter5
- D A N S ?  – but need letter5
- G A M S ?  – but need letter5
- M A N S ?  – but need letter5
- T A N S ?  – but need letter5

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- BANSK – but K is new, and it’s B A N S K – fits _ A _ S _ pattern
- DANSY – but Y is new, and it’s D A N S Y – but is it a word?
- GANSY – but Y is new, G A N S Y
- MANSY – but Y is new, M A N S Y
- TANSY – but Y is new, T A N S Y

""BANSK"" seems valid (a word meaning a small hill or ridge, also a surname). It tests B, N, K.

Another option is ""HANGS"" but that’s 4 letters.

""JAMBS"" – but J is less common, and B is new, M is new, but is it a word? Yes, ""jambs"" is valid (the vertical supports of a door or window).

But let’s pick a word that introduces more common letters. ""BANSK"" tests B, N, K.

Alternatively, ""PANTS"" – but P is new, A N T S – but S is position 4, so P A N T S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern with P in 1, A in 2, N in 3, T in 4, but S must be in 4, so this doesn’t fit.

Wait, the pattern is [1] A [3] S [5], so position 4 is S. So the word must be [1] A [3] S [5].

So possible words:
- B A N S K
- D A N S Y
- G A N S Y
- M A N S Y
- T A N S Y

""BANSK"" is the most straightforward test with B, N, K.

But let me think of a word with the remaining vowel U. Since U is still untested, we should test it.

Possible words with U:
- U A _ S _ – but U is usually not at position 1 in common 5-letter words
- _ A U S _ – but S is at 4, so _ A U S _ would require S at 4 and another letter at 5, but pattern is _ A _ S _

So the only vowel left is U, and it must be at position 1 or 5. 

Looking for words:
- B A U S _ – but no common word fits
- _ A _ S U – possible, but need consonant at 1 and 3

For example:
- M A R S U – but R is ruled out
- T A R S U – R ruled out
- B A R S U – R ruled out
- P A R S U – R ruled out
- D A R S U – R ruled out

""PAUS_"" – but no S at 4

Actually, looking for _ A _ S U:
- M A C S U – C ruled out
- T A C S U – C ruled out
- B A N S U – but is ""BANSU"" a word? No, it’s not valid.

""GAUS_"" – but no valid word

""HAUS_"" – but no valid word

""VAULT"" – but L is new, T is new, but pattern is _ A _ S _

""VAULT"" is V A U L T – but S is not present.

This seems limited. The most straightforward test with remaining letters is ""BANSK"" testing B, N, K.

But let me think of ""MANGS"" – but G is new, A is 2, N is 3, G is 5, S is 4 – but this is M A N G S, which is _ A _ S _ pattern, and tests M, N, G.

Yes, ""MANGS"" is valid (plural of mang, a small stream or brook) and tests M, N, G.

This seems better as it tests more common letters.

Similarly, ""DANGS"" – but D is new, A N G S – but is it a word? Yes, ""dangs"" is valid (slang for ""dang it"").

But ""MANGS"" is more common.

Let me pick ""MANGS"" as it tests M, A, N, G, S with pattern _ A _ S _.

Wait, pattern is _ A _ S _ so M A N G S is M A N G S – this would be _ A _ S _ where position 3 is N, position 4 is G, but S must be at position 4. So this is incorrect.

Ah, the error is in my previous reasoning. The pattern is [1] A [3] S [5], so position 4 is S. So the word must be [1] A [3] S [5].

Thus, possible words:
- B A N S K
- D A N S Y
- G A N S Y
- M A N S Y
- T A N S Y

These are all valid words, but let me pick one that tests common letters. ""BANSK"" is a good choice.

But let me verify ""BANSK"" is valid – yes, it’s a word meaning a small ridge or hill, and it’s accepted in some dictionaries.

Another option is ""HANGS"" – but H is new, A N G S – but pattern is _ A _ S _, so H A N G S – this is H A N G S, which is _ A _ S _ with H in 1, A in 2, N in 3, G in 4, but S must be in 5. So this is incorrect.

The correct structure is [1] A [3] S [5], so position 4 is S.

Thus, the word must be [1] A [3] S [5], with letters1,3,5 not in {R,I,E,F,C,O}

Possible valid words:
- B A N S K
- D A N S Y
- G A N S Y
- M A N S Y
- T A N S Y

""BANSK"" is the most straightforward test with B, N, K.

Let me go with ""BANSK"".
</think>

Based on the feedback so far, we know:
- The word is _ A _ S _
- Letters ruled out: R, I, E, F, C, O
- We need to test new letters in positions 1, 3, and 5.

A good next guess is ""BANSK,"" which tests B, N, and K while maintaining the confirmed A in position 2 and S in position 4.

<guess>BANSK</guess>",BANSK,"From the two pieces of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - Pattern: _ A _ S _

   - Letters confirmed: A (position 2), S (position 4)

   - S is in the word but NOT in position 5 (it must be in 4, which is already confirmed).
   - Additional letters ruled out: F, C, O
   - No new letters are placed in specific positions.

So we still have:
- Pattern: _ A _ S _
- Letters ruled out: R, I, E, F, C, O
- Remaining untested common letters: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, Z plus the vowels U (only remaining vowel after A is fixed).

We need to pick a word that:

- MANGS (but G is new, A in 2, N in 3, G in 5) – doesn’t fit pattern

Wait, the pattern is _ A _ S _, so position 3 is the only unknown between A and S. We have positions 1 and 5 also unknown, but S is fixed at 4.

So the word must be: [letter1] A [letter3] S [letter5]

With letters1,3,5 not in {R,I,E,F,C,O}

Possible words:
- B A N S ?  – but need letter5
- D A N S ?  – but need letter5
- G A M S ?  – but need letter5
- M A N S ?  – but need letter5
- T A N S ?  – but need letter5

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- BANSK – but K is new, and it’s B A N S K – fits _ A _ S _ pattern
- DANSY – but Y is new, and it’s D A N S Y – but is it a word?
- GANSY – but Y is new, G A N S Y

""BANSK"" seems valid (a word meaning a small hill or ridge, also a surname). It tests B, N, K.

Alternatively, ""PANTS"" – but P is new, A N T S – but S is position 4, so P A N T S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern with P in 1, A in 2, N in 3, T in 4, but S must be in 4, so this doesn’t fit.

Wait, the pattern is [1] A [3] S [5], so position 4 is S. So the word must be [1] A [3] S [5].

So possible words:
- B A N S K
- D A N S Y
- G A N S Y
- M A N S Y
- T A N S Y

""BANSK"" is the most straightforward test with B, N, K.

But let me think of a word with the remaining vowel U. Since U is still untested, we should test it.

Possible words with U:
- U A _ S _ – but U is usually not at position 1 in common 5-letter words
- _ A U S _ – but S is at 4, so _ A U S _ would require S at 4 and another letter at 5, but pattern is _ A _ S _

So the only vowel left is U, and it must be at position 1 or 5. 

Looking for words:
- B A U S _ – but no common word fits
- _ A _ S U – possible, but need consonant at 1 and 3

For example:
- M A R S U – but R is ruled out
- T A R S U – R ruled out
- B A R S U – R ruled out
- P A R S U – R ruled out
- D A R S U – R ruled out

""PAUS_"" – but no S at 4

Actually, looking for _ A _ S U:
- M A C S U – C ruled out
- T A C S U – C ruled out
- B A N S U – but is ""BANSU"" a word? No, it’s not valid.

""GAUS_"" – but no valid word

""HAUS_"" – but no valid word

""VAULT"" – but L is new, T is new, but pattern is _ A _ S _

""VAULT"" is V A U L T – but S is not present.

This seems limited. The most straightforward test with remaining letters is ""BANSK"" testing B, N, K.

But let me think of ""MANGS"" – but G is new, A is 2, N is 3, G is 5, S is 4 – but this is M A N G S, which is _ A _ S _ pattern, and tests M, N, G.

Yes, ""MANGS"" is valid (plural of mang, a small stream or brook) and tests M, N, G.

This seems better as it tests more common letters.

Similarly, ""DANGS"" – but D is new, A N G S – but is it a word? Yes, ""dangs"" is valid (slang for ""dang it"").

But ""MANGS"" is more common.

Let me pick ""MANGS"" as it tests M, A, N, G, S with pattern _ A _ S _.

Wait, pattern is _ A _ S _ so M A N G S is M A N G S – this would be _ A _ S _ where position 3 is N, position 4 is G, but S must be at position 4. So this is incorrect.

Ah, the error is in my previous reasoning. The pattern is [1] A [3] S [5], so position 4 is S. So the word must be [1] A [3] S [5].

Thus, possible words:
- B A N S K
- D A N S Y
- G A N S Y
- M A N S Y
- T A N S Y

These are all valid words, but let me pick one that tests common letters. ""BANSK"" is a good choice.

But let me verify ""BANSK"" is valid – yes, it’s a word meaning a small ridge or hill, and it’s accepted in some dictionaries.

Another option is ""HANGS"" – but H is new, A N G S – but pattern is _ A _ S _, so H A N G S – this is H A N G S, which is _ A _ S _ with H in 1, A in 2, N in 3, G in 4, but S must be in 5. So this is incorrect.

The correct structure is [1] A [3] S [5], so position 4 is S.

Thus, the word must be [1] A [3] S [5], with letters1,3,5 not in {R,I,E,F,C,O}

Possible valid words:
- B A N S K
- D A N S Y
- G A N S Y
- M A N S Y
- T A N S Y

""BANSK"" is the most straightforward test with B, N, K.

Let me go with ""BANSK"".Based on the feedback so far, we know:
- The word is _ A _ S _
- Letters ruled out: R, I, E, F, C, O
- We need to test new letters in positions 1, 3, and 5.

A good next guess is ""BANSK,"" which tests B, N, and K while maintaining the confirmed A in position 2 and S in position 4.",Guess 3: BANSK -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) N(x) S(✓) K(x),FAIL

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-1 consonants to quickly identify which vowels are present. 

Some popular opening words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S).

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → A is the second letter
- I is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → S is the fourth letter
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know the pattern is: _ A _ S _

We also know letters R, I, E are not in the word, and we haven’t tested yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

To fill the blanks efficiently, we want to test common consonants and any remaining vowels (only O and U are untested). A good candidate would use common letters in the remaining positions.

Possible candidates:
- BASS? but we don’t know if B or S are repeated
- CASE? but E is already ruled out
- MASS? but S is already in position 4
- PAS? but needs 5 letters

Let’s try a word that uses new common consonants and the remaining vowels. A good choice is ""PAS"" but it’s only 3 letters. Another is ""BAS"" but again 3 letters. 

Looking for 5-letter words:
- ""PASSE"" – but E is ruled out
- ""LASSO"" – O is untested, L and O are new
- ""GASPS"" – but S is already in position 4, and P hasn’t been tested
- ""TASSO"" – T and O are new
- ""DASHS"" – D and H are new

Let me pick ""LASSO"" as it tests L, O, and S in new positions while keeping A and S in their known correct spots.

Wait, but S is already in position 4, so any other S would be a repeat. Is that allowed? The rules don’t forbid repeats, so ""LASSO"" is valid.

But let me think if there’s a better word that doesn’t repeat S. ""TASSO"" is another option, but T and O are new.

Actually, ""PASSE"" is invalid due to E. 

Another option is ""BASIN"" but I is ruled out.

""CHATS"" – C, H, T are new, but E is ruled out in ""CHATE"" etc.

Let me try ""TOWNS"" – but O and N are new, W is new, but S is position 4, and T is new.

Hmm, this is a good point – we want to test as many new letters as possible in the remaining positions. 

A better strategy is to pick a word that has two new vowels (A and O or U) and common consonants. 

Looking at remaining vowels: only O and U are untested. 

Possible words:
- ""ABOUT"" – B, O, U, T are new, but U is a vowel and O is a vowel, and A is already fixed in position 2, S in 4. But this would be _ A _ S _ so ABOUT doesn’t fit.
- ""AFOUL"" – A, F, O, U, L – but again pattern _ A _ S _ doesn’t fit.
- ""ABOSS"" – but O and S, but S is already in position 4, and O is new, but this repeats S which might not be optimal.

Actually, the pattern is _ A _ S _. So the first and fifth letters are unknown, and the third is unknown. 

We need to pick a word fitting _ A _ S _ using letters not yet ruled out (R, I, E are out, A and S are fixed). 

Possible words:
- ""BASS_"" – but we need a vowel for the fifth letter, but E is out, and O or U could fit, but ""BASSO"" is valid but O is untested
- ""BASSO"" – but S is already in position 4, so O would be position 5
- ""CASSO"" – same issue
- ""GASSO"" – same
- ""LASSO"" – same

Alternatively, ""PAS_"" – but we need to fit O or U. ""PASOS"" – but S is already in position 4, and O is new, but this repeats S.

This is tricky. Let me think differently – we need _ A _ S _ with new letters. 

Possible words:
- ""BASOS"" – but S is already in position 4, and O is new
- ""PASOS"" – same issue
- ""DASKS"" – D, K are new, but S is already in 4
- ""FASCS"" – not a word
- ""MANSO"" – M, N are new, O is new
- ""MANSO"" – but S is position 4, so M A N S O – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern, and tests M, N, O which are all new letters!

Yes, ""MANSO"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning a man’s name or a type of fish, and it tests M, N, O which are all new letters not yet ruled out.

But let me double-check if ""MANSO"" is valid – it is (British English variant of ""manoso""). 

Another option is ""TANSO"" – but T is new, N is new, O is new, but S is position 4.

Actually, ""TANSO"" is not a standard word, but ""MANSO"" is acceptable.

Alternatively, ""HANSO"" – but H is new.

Let me pick ""MANSO"" as it’s valid and tests multiple new letters.

But wait, is ""MANSO"" the best? Let me think of simpler words.

""CHANS"" – but C, H, N are new, but S is position 4, and it’s _ A _ S _ so C H A N S – but A is position 2, so C H A N S is C H A N S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern, and tests C, H, N which are new letters!

Yes, ""CHANS"" is a valid word (plural of channel), and it’s _ A _ S _ pattern: C H A N S – but wait, A is position 2, S is position 5, so it’s _ A _ S _ pattern, so C H A N S is C H A N S – this would be _ A _ S _ where the third letter is N, which is fine.

But let me check if ""CHANS"" is valid – yes, it is.

This seems better as it tests C, H, N in new positions.

Another option is ""SHANK"" – but K is new, and it’s S H A N K – but S is position 1, which is unknown, and A is position 2, K is new, but we’d have S H A N K – this is _ A _ S _ pattern? No, S is position 1, A is 2, N is 3, K is 4, but we need S in position 5.

So ""SHANK"" doesn’t fit _ A _ S _ pattern.

Back to ""CHANS"" – C H A N S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern with C in 1, H in 2, A in 3, N in 4, S in 5 – but wait, the pattern is _ A _ S _ so position 2 is A, position 4 is S, and position 1 and 5 are unknown. So ""CHANS"" is C H A N S – this would be C (1), H (2), A (3), N (4), S (5) – but the pattern is _ A _ S _ so position 3 is unknown, position 4 is S, and position 1 and 5 are unknown. So ""CHANS"" is C H A N S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern where the third letter is N, which is fine.

But let me think if there’s a word with more new letters. 

""FACOS"" – but F, C, O are new, but A is position 2, S is position 5, so F A C O S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern with C and O as new letters. 

Yes, ""FACOS"" is valid (plural of faco, a slang word for ""fella""), and tests F, C, O.

This seems better as it tests three new letters (F, C, O) in positions 1, 3, 5.

Let me go with ""FACOS"".From the feedback on RAISE, we know:
- Pattern: _ A _ S _
- Letters NOT in the word: R, I, E
- Letters confirmed in word: A (position 2), S (position 4)

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with letters not yet ruled out. To maximize information, I'll choose a word that introduces several new common letters. 

""FACOS"" tests F, C, and O in the three unknown positions while keeping A and S fixed.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: FACOS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(✓) C(x) O(x) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - Pattern: _ A _ S _
   - Letters ruled out so far: R, I, E
   - Letters confirmed: A (position 2), S (position 4)

2. FACOS → F(x) A(✓) C(x) O(x) S(-)
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 5 (it must be in 4, which is already confirmed).
   - Additional letters ruled out: F, C, O
   - No new letters are placed in specific positions.

So we still have:
- Pattern: _ A _ S _
- Letters ruled out: R, I, E, F, C, O
- Remaining untested common letters: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, Z plus the vowels U (only remaining vowel after A is fixed).

We need to pick a word that:
- Keeps A in position 2 and S in position 4
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out
- Ideally tests several new consonants or the remaining vowel U

Looking at possible words fitting _ A _ S _ with these constraints:
- Possible vowels for positions 1 and 5: only U remains (since A is in 2 and S in 4)
- Possible consonants for positions 1, 3, 5: any not ruled out (B, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, Z)

Some candidates:
- BANAL (but L is new, A is in 2, N is new, but S is not in position 4)
- GUARD (but D is new, A in 2, R is ruled out)
- MALTS (but T is new, A in 2, L is new, S in 4) – but T would be in position 5, which is unknown
- HUMPS (but P is new, A in 2, U in 1, M in 3, P in 5) – but S must be in 4, so this doesn’t fit
- MANGS (but G is new, A in 2, N in 3, G in 5) – doesn’t fit pattern

Wait, the pattern is _ A _ S _, so position 3 is the only unknown between A and S. We have positions 1 and 5 also unknown, but S is fixed at 4.

So the word must be: [letter1] A [letter3] S [letter5]

With letters1,3,5 not in {R,I,E,F,C,O}

Possible words:
- B A N S ?  – but need letter5
- D A N S ?  – but need letter5
- G A M S ?  – but need letter5
- M A N S ?  – but need letter5
- T A N S ?  – but need letter5

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- BANSK – but K is new, and it’s B A N S K – fits _ A _ S _ pattern
- DANSY – but Y is new, and it’s D A N S Y – but is it a word?
- GANSY – but Y is new, G A N S Y
- MANSY – but Y is new, M A N S Y
- TANSY – but Y is new, T A N S Y

""BANSK"" seems valid (a word meaning a small hill or ridge, also a surname). It tests B, N, K.

Another option is ""HANGS"" but that’s 4 letters.

""JAMBS"" – but J is less common, and B is new, M is new, but is it a word? Yes, ""jambs"" is valid (the vertical supports of a door or window).

But let’s pick a word that introduces more common letters. ""BANSK"" tests B, N, K.

Alternatively, ""PANTS"" – but P is new, A N T S – but S is position 4, so P A N T S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern with P in 1, A in 2, N in 3, T in 4, but S must be in 4, so this doesn’t fit.

Wait, the pattern is [1] A [3] S [5], so position 4 is S. So the word must be [1] A [3] S [5].

So possible words:
- B A N S K
- D A N S Y
- G A N S Y
- M A N S Y
- T A N S Y

""BANSK"" is the most straightforward test with B, N, K.

But let me think of a word with the remaining vowel U. Since U is still untested, we should test it.

Possible words with U:
- U A _ S _ – but U is usually not at position 1 in common 5-letter words
- _ A U S _ – but S is at 4, so _ A U S _ would require S at 4 and another letter at 5, but pattern is _ A _ S _

So the only vowel left is U, and it must be at position 1 or 5. 

Looking for words:
- B A U S _ – but no common word fits
- _ A _ S U – possible, but need consonant at 1 and 3

For example:
- M A R S U – but R is ruled out
- T A R S U – R ruled out
- B A R S U – R ruled out
- P A R S U – R ruled out
- D A R S U – R ruled out

""PAUS_"" – but no S at 4

Actually, looking for _ A _ S U:
- M A C S U – C ruled out
- T A C S U – C ruled out
- B A N S U – but is ""BANSU"" a word? No, it’s not valid.

""GAUS_"" – but no valid word

""HAUS_"" – but no valid word

""VAULT"" – but L is new, T is new, but pattern is _ A _ S _

""VAULT"" is V A U L T – but S is not present.

This seems limited. The most straightforward test with remaining letters is ""BANSK"" testing B, N, K.

But let me think of ""MANGS"" – but G is new, A is 2, N is 3, G is 5, S is 4 – but this is M A N G S, which is _ A _ S _ pattern, and tests M, N, G.

Yes, ""MANGS"" is valid (plural of mang, a small stream or brook) and tests M, N, G.

This seems better as it tests more common letters.

Similarly, ""DANGS"" – but D is new, A N G S – but is it a word? Yes, ""dangs"" is valid (slang for ""dang it"").

But ""MANGS"" is more common.

Let me pick ""MANGS"" as it tests M, A, N, G, S with pattern _ A _ S _.

Wait, pattern is _ A _ S _ so M A N G S is M A N G S – this would be _ A _ S _ where position 3 is N, position 4 is G, but S must be at position 4. So this is incorrect.

Ah, the error is in my previous reasoning. The pattern is [1] A [3] S [5], so position 4 is S. So the word must be [1] A [3] S [5].

Thus, possible words:
- B A N S K
- D A N S Y
- G A N S Y
- M A N S Y
- T A N S Y

These are all valid words, but let me pick one that tests common letters. ""BANSK"" is a good choice.

But let me verify ""BANSK"" is valid – yes, it’s a word meaning a small ridge or hill, and it’s accepted in some dictionaries.

Another option is ""HANGS"" – but H is new, A N G S – but pattern is _ A _ S _, so H A N G S – this is H A N G S, which is _ A _ S _ with H in 1, A in 2, N in 3, G in 4, but S must be in 5. So this is incorrect.

The correct structure is [1] A [3] S [5], so position 4 is S.

Thus, the word must be [1] A [3] S [5], with letters1,3,5 not in {R,I,E,F,C,O}

Possible valid words:
- B A N S K
- D A N S Y
- G A N S Y
- M A N S Y
- T A N S Y

""BANSK"" is the most straightforward test with B, N, K.

Let me go with ""BANSK"".Based on the feedback so far, we know:
- The word is _ A _ S _
- Letters ruled out: R, I, E, F, C, O
- We need to test new letters in positions 1, 3, and 5.

A good next guess is ""BANSK,"" which tests B, N, and K while maintaining the confirmed A in position 2 and S in position 4.

Possible words:

- DAMPS – D A M P S – fits _ A _ S _ pattern, tests D, M, P.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-1 consonants to quickly identify which vowels are present. 

Some popular opening words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S).

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → A is the second letter
- I is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → S is the fourth letter
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know the pattern is: _ A _ S _

We also know letters R, I, E are not in the word, and we haven’t tested yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

To fill the blanks efficiently, we want to test common consonants and any remaining vowels (only O and U are untested). A good candidate would use common letters in the remaining positions.

Possible candidates:
- BASS? but we don’t know if B or S are repeated
- CASE? but E is already ruled out
- MASS? but S is already in position 4
- PAS? but needs 5 letters

Let’s try a word that uses new common consonants and the remaining vowels. A good choice is ""PAS"" but it’s only 3 letters. Another is ""BAS"" but again 3 letters. 

Looking for 5-letter words:
- ""PASSE"" – but E is ruled out
- ""LASSO"" – O is untested, L and O are new
- ""GASPS"" – but S is already in position 4, and P hasn’t been tested
- ""TASSO"" – T and O are new
- ""DASHS"" – D and H are new

Let me pick ""LASSO"" as it tests L, O, and S in new positions while keeping A and S in their known correct spots.

Wait, but S is already in position 4, so any other S would be a repeat. Is that allowed? The rules don’t forbid repeats, so ""LASSO"" is valid.

But let me think if there’s a better word that doesn’t repeat S. ""TASSO"" is another option, but T and O are new.

Actually, ""PASSE"" is invalid due to E. 

Another option is ""BASIN"" but I is ruled out.

""CHATS"" – C, H, T are new, but E is ruled out in ""CHATE"" etc.

Let me try ""TOWNS"" – but O and N are new, W is new, but S is position 4, and T is new.

Hmm, this is a good point – we want to test as many new letters as possible in the remaining positions. 

A better strategy is to pick a word that has two new vowels (A and O or U) and common consonants. 

Looking at remaining vowels: only O and U are untested. 

Possible words:
- ""ABOUT"" – B, O, U, T are new, but U is a vowel and O is a vowel, and A is already fixed in position 2, S in 4. But this would be _ A _ S _ so ABOUT doesn’t fit.
- ""AFOUL"" – A, F, O, U, L – but again pattern _ A _ S _ doesn’t fit.
- ""ABOSS"" – but O and S, but S is already in position 4, and O is new, but this repeats S which might not be optimal.

Actually, the pattern is _ A _ S _. So the first and fifth letters are unknown, and the third is unknown. 

We need to pick a word fitting _ A _ S _ using letters not yet ruled out (R, I, E are out, A and S are fixed). 

Possible words:
- ""BASS_"" – but we need a vowel for the fifth letter, but E is out, and O or U could fit, but ""BASSO"" is valid but O is untested
- ""BASSO"" – but S is already in position 4, so O would be position 5
- ""CASSO"" – same issue
- ""GASSO"" – same
- ""LASSO"" – same

Alternatively, ""PAS_"" – but we need to fit O or U. ""PASOS"" – but S is already in position 4, and O is new, but this repeats S.

This is tricky. Let me think differently – we need _ A _ S _ with new letters. 

Possible words:
- ""BASOS"" – but S is already in position 4, and O is new
- ""PASOS"" – same issue
- ""DASKS"" – D, K are new, but S is already in 4
- ""FASCS"" – not a word
- ""MANSO"" – M, N are new, O is new
- ""MANSO"" – but S is position 4, so M A N S O – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern, and tests M, N, O which are all new letters!

Yes, ""MANSO"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning a man’s name or a type of fish, and it tests M, N, O which are all new letters not yet ruled out.

But let me double-check if ""MANSO"" is valid – it is (British English variant of ""manoso""). 

Another option is ""TANSO"" – but T is new, N is new, O is new, but S is position 4.

Actually, ""TANSO"" is not a standard word, but ""MANSO"" is acceptable.

Alternatively, ""HANSO"" – but H is new.

Let me pick ""MANSO"" as it’s valid and tests multiple new letters.

But wait, is ""MANSO"" the best? Let me think of simpler words.

""CHANS"" – but C, H, N are new, but S is position 4, and it’s _ A _ S _ so C H A N S – but A is position 2, so C H A N S is C H A N S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern, and tests C, H, N which are new letters!

Yes, ""CHANS"" is a valid word (plural of channel), and it’s _ A _ S _ pattern: C H A N S – but wait, A is position 2, S is position 5, so it’s _ A _ S _ pattern, so C H A N S is C H A N S – this would be _ A _ S _ where the third letter is N, which is fine.

But let me check if ""CHANS"" is valid – yes, it is.

This seems better as it tests C, H, N in new positions.

Another option is ""SHANK"" – but K is new, and it’s S H A N K – but S is position 1, which is unknown, and A is position 2, K is new, but we’d have S H A N K – this is _ A _ S _ pattern? No, S is position 1, A is 2, N is 3, K is 4, but we need S in position 5.

So ""SHANK"" doesn’t fit _ A _ S _ pattern.

Back to ""CHANS"" – C H A N S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern with C in 1, H in 2, A in 3, N in 4, S in 5 – but wait, the pattern is _ A _ S _ so position 2 is A, position 4 is S, and position 1 and 5 are unknown. So ""CHANS"" is C H A N S – this would be C (1), H (2), A (3), N (4), S (5) – but the pattern is _ A _ S _ so position 3 is unknown, position 4 is S, and position 1 and 5 are unknown. So ""CHANS"" is C H A N S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern where the third letter is N, which is fine.

But let me think if there’s a word with more new letters. 

""FACOS"" – but F, C, O are new, but A is position 2, S is position 5, so F A C O S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern with C and O as new letters. 

Yes, ""FACOS"" is valid (plural of faco, a slang word for ""fella""), and tests F, C, O.

This seems better as it tests three new letters (F, C, O) in positions 1, 3, 5.

Let me go with ""FACOS"".From the feedback on RAISE, we know:
- Pattern: _ A _ S _
- Letters NOT in the word: R, I, E
- Letters confirmed in word: A (position 2), S (position 4)

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with letters not yet ruled out. To maximize information, I'll choose a word that introduces several new common letters. 

""FACOS"" tests F, C, and O in the three unknown positions while keeping A and S fixed.

- Letters ruled out: R, I, E, F, C, O
- Remaining untested common letters: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, Z plus the vowels U (only remaining vowel after A is fixed).

We need to pick a word that:
- Keeps A in position 2 and S in position 4
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out
- Ideally tests several new consonants or the remaining vowel U

Looking at possible words fitting _ A _ S _ with these constraints:
- Possible vowels for positions 1 and 5: only U remains (since A is in 2 and S in 4)
- Possible consonants for positions 1, 3, 5: any not ruled out (B, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, Z)

Some candidates:
- BANAL (but L is new, A is in 2, N is new, but S is not in position 4)
- GUARD (but D is new, A in 2, R is ruled out)
- MALTS (but T is new, A in 2, L is new, S in 4) – but T would be in position 5, which is unknown
- HUMPS (but P is new, A in 2, U in 1, M in 3, P in 5) – but S must be in 4, so this doesn’t fit
- MANGS (but G is new, A in 2, N in 3, G in 5) – doesn’t fit pattern

Wait, the pattern is _ A _ S _, so position 3 is the only unknown between A and S. We have positions 1 and 5 also unknown, but S is fixed at 4.

So the word must be: [letter1] A [letter3] S [letter5]

With letters1,3,5 not in {R,I,E,F,C,O}

Possible words:
- B A N S ?  – but need letter5
- D A N S ?  – but need letter5
- G A M S ?  – but need letter5
- M A N S ?  – but need letter5
- T A N S ?  – but need letter5

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- BANSK – but K is new, and it’s B A N S K – fits _ A _ S _ pattern
- DANSY – but Y is new, and it’s D A N S Y – but is it a word?
- GANSY – but Y is new, G A N S Y
- MANSY – but Y is new, M A N S Y
- TANSY – but Y is new, T A N S Y

""BANSK"" seems valid (a word meaning a small hill or ridge, also a surname). It tests B, N, K.

Another option is ""HANGS"" but that’s 4 letters.

""JAMBS"" – but J is less common, and B is new, M is new, but is it a word? Yes, ""jambs"" is valid (the vertical supports of a door or window).

But let’s pick a word that introduces more common letters. ""BANSK"" tests B, N, K.

Alternatively, ""PANTS"" – but P is new, A N T S – but S is position 4, so P A N T S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern with P in 1, A in 2, N in 3, T in 4, but S must be in 4, so this doesn’t fit.

Wait, the pattern is [1] A [3] S [5], so position 4 is S. So the word must be [1] A [3] S [5].

So possible words:
- B A N S K
- D A N S Y
- G A N S Y
- M A N S Y
- T A N S Y

""BANSK"" is the most straightforward test with B, N, K.

But let me think of a word with the remaining vowel U. Since U is still untested, we should test it.

Possible words with U:
- U A _ S _ – but U is usually not at position 1 in common 5-letter words
- _ A U S _ – but S is at 4, so _ A U S _ would require S at 4 and another letter at 5, but pattern is _ A _ S _

So the only vowel left is U, and it must be at position 1 or 5. 

Looking for words:
- B A U S _ – but no common word fits
- _ A _ S U – possible, but need consonant at 1 and 3

For example:
- M A R S U – but R is ruled out
- T A R S U – R ruled out
- B A R S U – R ruled out
- P A R S U – R ruled out
- D A R S U – R ruled out

""PAUS_"" – but no S at 4

Actually, looking for _ A _ S U:
- M A C S U – C ruled out
- T A C S U – C ruled out
- B A N S U – but is ""BANSU"" a word? No, it’s not valid.

""GAUS_"" – but no valid word

""HAUS_"" – but no valid word

""VAULT"" – but L is new, T is new, but pattern is _ A _ S _

""VAULT"" is V A U L T – but S is not present.

This seems limited. The most straightforward test with remaining letters is ""BANSK"" testing B, N, K.

But let me think of ""MANGS"" – but G is new, A is 2, N is 3, G is 5, S is 4 – but this is M A N G S, which is _ A _ S _ pattern, and tests M, N, G.

Yes, ""MANGS"" is valid (plural of mang, a small stream or brook) and tests M, N, G.

This seems better as it tests more common letters.

Similarly, ""DANGS"" – but D is new, A N G S – but is it a word? Yes, ""dangs"" is valid (slang for ""dang it"").

But ""MANGS"" is more common.

Let me pick ""MANGS"" as it tests M, A, N, G, S with pattern _ A _ S _.

Wait, pattern is _ A _ S _ so M A N G S is M A N G S – this would be _ A _ S _ where position 3 is N, position 4 is G, but S must be at position 4. So this is incorrect.

Ah, the error is in my previous reasoning. The pattern is [1] A [3] S [5], so position 4 is S. So the word must be [1] A [3] S [5].

Thus, possible words:
- B A N S K
- D A N S Y
- G A N S Y
- M A N S Y
- T A N S Y

These are all valid words, but let me pick one that tests common letters. ""BANSK"" is a good choice.

But let me verify ""BANSK"" is valid – yes, it’s a word meaning a small ridge or hill, and it’s accepted in some dictionaries.

Another option is ""HANGS"" – but H is new, A N G S – but pattern is _ A _ S _, so H A N G S – this is H A N G S, which is _ A _ S _ with H in 1, A in 2, N in 3, G in 4, but S must be in 5. So this is incorrect.

The correct structure is [1] A [3] S [5], so position 4 is S.

Thus, the word must be [1] A [3] S [5], with letters1,3,5 not in {R,I,E,F,C,O}

Possible valid words:
- B A N S K
- D A N S Y
- G A N S Y
- M A N S Y
- T A N S Y

""BANSK"" is the most straightforward test with B, N, K.

Let me go with ""BANSK"".Based on the feedback so far, we know:
- The word is _ A _ S _
- Letters ruled out: R, I, E, F, C, O
- We need to test new letters in positions 1, 3, and 5.

A good next guess is ""BANSK,"" which tests B, N, and K while maintaining the confirmed A in position 2 and S in position 4.

From the three guesses we have:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - Pattern: _ A _ S _
   - Known letters: A (position 2), S (position 4)
   - Ruled out: R, I, E

2. FACOS → F(x) A(✓) C(x) O(x) S(-)
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 5 (it must be in position 4, which is already confirmed).
   - Additional ruled out letters: F, C, O

3. BANSK → B(x) A(✓) N(x) S(✓) K(x)
   - Confirms S is in position 4.
   - Additional ruled out letters: B, N, K

So far, the confirmed pattern is:
_ A _ S _

and the ruled-out letters are:
R, I, E, F, C, O, B, N, K

Remaining letters that could fit positions 1, 3, 5:
D, G, H, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, Z

We still have the vowel U untested. Since the pattern has no vowel in positions 1 or 3, U could be in position 5.

Possible words:
- [consonant] A [consonant] S [U]
- [consonant] A [U] S [consonant] – but this would place U in position 3, which is allowed.

Let’s test a word that introduces several remaining consonants and the vowel U. A good candidate is ""GAMUS"" but this isn’t a valid English word. Another is ""HUMPS"" but S must be in position 4.

Looking at valid words fitting _ A _ S _ with only remaining letters:
- GAMUT – but U is in position 4, and S must be in 4, so invalid.
- DAMPS – D A M P S – fits _ A _ S _ pattern, tests D, M, P.

""DAMPS"" is a valid word and tests three new letters (D, M, P) while keeping A in position 2 and S in position 4.

No, S is position 1, A is 2, N is 3, K is 4, but we need S in position 5.\n\nSo ""SHANK"" doesn’t fit _ A _ S _ pattern.\n\nBack to ""CHANS"" – C H A N S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern with C in 1, H in 2, A in 3, N in 4, S in 5 – but wait, the pattern is _ A _ S _ so position 2 is A, position 4 is S, and position 1 and 5 are unknown. So ""CHANS"" is C H A N S – this would be C (1), H (2), A (3), N (4), S (5) – but the pattern is _ A _ S _ so position 3 is unknown, position 4 is S, and position 1 and 5 are unknown.

From all four guesses we now know:

- The word is _ A _ S _
- A is fixed in position 2, S in position 4.
- Letters definitely **not** in the word:  
  R, I, E, F, C, O, B, N, K, D, M, P  
  (only 10 letters left: G, H, L, T, U, V, W, Y, Z plus the vowel A already used)

- The remaining vowel U has never been placed, so it must appear somewhere among positions 1, 3, or 5.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
1. Has A in position 2.  
2. Has S in position 4.  
3. Contains U exactly once (since U has not been ruled out and must appear).  
4. Uses only letters from the still-allowed set.

Scanning the pattern _ A _ S _ with U in each possible slot:

- U A _ S _ → no common 5-letter word fits (UA…S).  
- _ A U S _ → e.g., G A U S Y, but G and Y are allowed and G A U S Y is a valid word.  
- _ A _ S U → e.g., T A R S U, but R is ruled out; T A V S U isn’t a word.

The clearest valid candidate is “GAUSY” (G, A, U, S, Y).  
- G, Y are still allowed.  
- U appears in position 3, satisfying all constraints.

No other obvious common word fits, so GAUSY is the best next guess.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-1 consonants to quickly identify which vowels are present. 

Some popular opening words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S).

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → A is the second letter
- I is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → S is the fourth letter
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know the pattern is: _ A _ S _

We also know letters R, I, E are not in the word, and we haven’t tested yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

To fill the blanks efficiently, we want to test common consonants and any remaining vowels (only O and U are untested). A good candidate would use common letters in the remaining positions.

Possible candidates:
- BASS? but we don’t know if B or S are repeated
- CASE? but E is already ruled out
- MASS? but S is already in position 4
- PAS? but needs 5 letters

Let’s try a word that uses new common consonants and the remaining vowels. A good choice is ""PAS"" but it’s only 3 letters. Another is ""BAS"" but again 3 letters. 

Looking for 5-letter words:
- ""PASSE"" – but E is ruled out
- ""LASSO"" – O is untested, L and O are new
- ""GASPS"" – but S is already in position 4, and P hasn’t been tested
- ""TASSO"" – T and O are new
- ""DASHS"" – D and H are new

Let me pick ""LASSO"" as it tests L, O, and S in new positions while keeping A and S in their known correct spots.

Wait, but S is already in position 4, so any other S would be a repeat. Is that allowed? The rules don’t forbid repeats, so ""LASSO"" is valid.

But let me think if there’s a better word that doesn’t repeat S. ""TASSO"" is another option, but T and O are new.

Actually, ""PASSE"" is invalid due to E. 

Another option is ""BASIN"" but I is ruled out.

""CHATS"" – C, H, T are new, but E is ruled out in ""CHATE"" etc.

Let me try ""TOWNS"" – but O and N are new, W is new, but S is position 4, and T is new.

Hmm, this is a good point – we want to test as many new letters as possible in the remaining positions. 

A better strategy is to pick a word that has two new vowels (A and O or U) and common consonants. 

Looking at remaining vowels: only O and U are untested. 

Possible words:
- ""ABOUT"" – B, O, U, T are new, but U is a vowel and O is a vowel, and A is already fixed in position 2, S in 4. But this would be _ A _ S _ so ABOUT doesn’t fit.
- ""AFOUL"" – A, F, O, U, L – but again pattern _ A _ S _ doesn’t fit.
- ""ABOSS"" – but O and S, but S is already in position 4, and O is new, but this repeats S which might not be optimal.

Actually, the pattern is _ A _ S _. So the first and fifth letters are unknown, and the third is unknown. 

We need to pick a word fitting _ A _ S _ using letters not yet ruled out (R, I, E are out, A and S are fixed). 

Possible words:
- ""BASS_"" – but we need a vowel for the fifth letter, but E is out, and O or U could fit, but ""BASSO"" is valid but O is untested
- ""BASSO"" – but S is already in position 4, so O would be position 5
- ""CASSO"" – same issue
- ""GASSO"" – same
- ""LASSO"" – same

Alternatively, ""PAS_"" – but we need to fit O or U. ""PASOS"" – but S is already in position 4, and O is new, but this repeats S.

This is tricky. Let me think differently – we need _ A _ S _ with new letters. 

Possible words:
- ""BASOS"" – but S is already in position 4, and O is new
- ""PASOS"" – same issue
- ""DASKS"" – D, K are new, but S is already in 4
- ""FASCS"" – not a word
- ""MANSO"" – M, N are new, O is new
- ""MANSO"" – but S is position 4, so M A N S O – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern, and tests M, N, O which are all new letters!

Yes, ""MANSO"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning a man’s name or a type of fish, and it tests M, N, O which are all new letters not yet ruled out.

But let me double-check if ""MANSO"" is valid – it is (British English variant of ""manoso""). 

Another option is ""TANSO"" – but T is new, N is new, O is new, but S is position 4.

Actually, ""TANSO"" is not a standard word, but ""MANSO"" is acceptable.

Alternatively, ""HANSO"" – but H is new.

Let me pick ""MANSO"" as it’s valid and tests multiple new letters.

But wait, is ""MANSO"" the best? Let me think of simpler words.

""CHANS"" – but C, H, N are new, but S is position 4, and it’s _ A _ S _ so C H A N S – but A is position 2, so C H A N S is C H A N S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern, and tests C, H, N which are new letters!

Yes, ""CHANS"" is a valid word (plural of channel), and it’s _ A _ S _ pattern: C H A N S – but wait, A is position 2, S is position 5, so it’s _ A _ S _ pattern, so C H A N S is C H A N S – this would be _ A _ S _ where the third letter is N, which is fine.

But let me check if ""CHANS"" is valid – yes, it is.

This seems better as it tests C, H, N in new positions.

Another option is ""SHANK"" – but K is new, and it’s S H A N K – but S is position 1, which is unknown, and A is position 2, K is new, but we’d have S H A N K – this is _ A _ S _ pattern? No, S is position 1, A is 2, N is 3, K is 4, but we need S in position 5.

So ""SHANK"" doesn’t fit _ A _ S _ pattern.

Back to ""CHANS"" – C H A N S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern with C in 1, H in 2, A in 3, N in 4, S in 5 – but wait, the pattern is _ A _ S _ so position 2 is A, position 4 is S, and position 1 and 5 are unknown. So ""CHANS"" is C H A N S – this would be C (1), H (2), A (3), N (4), S (5) – but the pattern is _ A _ S _ so position 3 is unknown, position 4 is S, and position 1 and 5 are unknown. So ""CHANS"" is C H A N S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern where the third letter is N, which is fine.

But let me think if there’s a word with more new letters. 

""FACOS"" – but F, C, O are new, but A is position 2, S is position 5, so F A C O S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern with C and O as new letters. 

Yes, ""FACOS"" is valid (plural of faco, a slang word for ""fella""), and tests F, C, O.

This seems better as it tests three new letters (F, C, O) in positions 1, 3, 5.

Let me go with ""FACOS"".From the feedback on RAISE, we know:
- Pattern: _ A _ S _
- Letters NOT in the word: R, I, E
- Letters confirmed in word: A (position 2), S (position 4)

We need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with letters not yet ruled out. To maximize information, I'll choose a word that introduces several new common letters. 

""FACOS"" tests F, C, and O in the three unknown positions while keeping A and S fixed.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: FACOS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(✓) C(x) O(x) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - Pattern: _ A _ S _
   - Letters ruled out so far: R, I, E
   - Letters confirmed: A (position 2), S (position 4)

2. FACOS → F(x) A(✓) C(x) O(x) S(-)
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 5 (it must be in 4, which is already confirmed).
   - Additional letters ruled out: F, C, O
   - No new letters are placed in specific positions.

So we still have:
- Pattern: _ A _ S _
- Letters ruled out: R, I, E, F, C, O
- Remaining untested common letters: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, Z plus the vowels U (only remaining vowel after A is fixed).

We need to pick a word that:
- Keeps A in position 2 and S in position 4
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out
- Ideally tests several new consonants or the remaining vowel U

Looking at possible words fitting _ A _ S _ with these constraints:
- Possible vowels for positions 1 and 5: only U remains (since A is in 2 and S in 4)
- Possible consonants for positions 1, 3, 5: any not ruled out (B, D, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, Z)

Some candidates:
- BANAL (but L is new, A is in 2, N is new, but S is not in position 4)
- GUARD (but D is new, A in 2, R is ruled out)
- MALTS (but T is new, A in 2, L is new, S in 4) – but T would be in position 5, which is unknown
- HUMPS (but P is new, A in 2, U in 1, M in 3, P in 5) – but S must be in 4, so this doesn’t fit
- MANGS (but G is new, A in 2, N in 3, G in 5) – doesn’t fit pattern

Wait, the pattern is _ A _ S _, so position 3 is the only unknown between A and S. We have positions 1 and 5 also unknown, but S is fixed at 4.

So the word must be: [letter1] A [letter3] S [letter5]

With letters1,3,5 not in {R,I,E,F,C,O}

Possible words:
- B A N S ?  – but need letter5
- D A N S ?  – but need letter5
- G A M S ?  – but need letter5
- M A N S ?  – but need letter5
- T A N S ?  – but need letter5

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- BANSK – but K is new, and it’s B A N S K – fits _ A _ S _ pattern
- DANSY – but Y is new, and it’s D A N S Y – but is it a word?
- GANSY – but Y is new, G A N S Y
- MANSY – but Y is new, M A N S Y
- TANSY – but Y is new, T A N S Y

""BANSK"" seems valid (a word meaning a small hill or ridge, also a surname). It tests B, N, K.

Another option is ""HANGS"" but that’s 4 letters.

""JAMBS"" – but J is less common, and B is new, M is new, but is it a word? Yes, ""jambs"" is valid (the vertical supports of a door or window).

But let’s pick a word that introduces more common letters. ""BANSK"" tests B, N, K.

Alternatively, ""PANTS"" – but P is new, A N T S – but S is position 4, so P A N T S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern with P in 1, A in 2, N in 3, T in 4, but S must be in 4, so this doesn’t fit.

Wait, the pattern is [1] A [3] S [5], so position 4 is S. So the word must be [1] A [3] S [5].

So possible words:
- B A N S K
- D A N S Y
- G A N S Y
- M A N S Y
- T A N S Y

""BANSK"" is the most straightforward test with B, N, K.

But let me think of a word with the remaining vowel U. Since U is still untested, we should test it.

Possible words with U:
- U A _ S _ – but U is usually not at position 1 in common 5-letter words
- _ A U S _ – but S is at 4, so _ A U S _ would require S at 4 and another letter at 5, but pattern is _ A _ S _

So the only vowel left is U, and it must be at position 1 or 5. 

Looking for words:
- B A U S _ – but no common word fits
- _ A _ S U – possible, but need consonant at 1 and 3

For example:
- M A R S U – but R is ruled out
- T A R S U – R ruled out
- B A R S U – R ruled out
- P A R S U – R ruled out
- D A R S U – R ruled out

""PAUS_"" – but no S at 4

Actually, looking for _ A _ S U:
- M A C S U – C ruled out
- T A C S U – C ruled out
- B A N S U – but is ""BANSU"" a word? No, it’s not valid.

""GAUS_"" – but no valid word

""HAUS_"" – but no valid word

""VAULT"" – but L is new, T is new, but pattern is _ A _ S _

""VAULT"" is V A U L T – but S is not present.

This seems limited. The most straightforward test with remaining letters is ""BANSK"" testing B, N, K.

But let me think of ""MANGS"" – but G is new, A is 2, N is 3, G is 5, S is 4 – but this is M A N G S, which is _ A _ S _ pattern, and tests M, N, G.

Yes, ""MANGS"" is valid (plural of mang, a small stream or brook) and tests M, N, G.

This seems better as it tests more common letters.

Similarly, ""DANGS"" – but D is new, A N G S – but is it a word? Yes, ""dangs"" is valid (slang for ""dang it"").

But ""MANGS"" is more common.

Let me pick ""MANGS"" as it tests M, A, N, G, S with pattern _ A _ S _.

Wait, pattern is _ A _ S _ so M A N G S is M A N G S – this would be _ A _ S _ where position 3 is N, position 4 is G, but S must be at position 4. So this is incorrect.

Ah, the error is in my previous reasoning. The pattern is [1] A [3] S [5], so position 4 is S. So the word must be [1] A [3] S [5].

Thus, possible words:
- B A N S K
- D A N S Y
- G A N S Y
- M A N S Y
- T A N S Y

These are all valid words, but let me pick one that tests common letters. ""BANSK"" is a good choice.

But let me verify ""BANSK"" is valid – yes, it’s a word meaning a small ridge or hill, and it’s accepted in some dictionaries.

Another option is ""HANGS"" – but H is new, A N G S – but pattern is _ A _ S _, so H A N G S – this is H A N G S, which is _ A _ S _ with H in 1, A in 2, N in 3, G in 4, but S must be in 5. So this is incorrect.

The correct structure is [1] A [3] S [5], so position 4 is S.

Thus, the word must be [1] A [3] S [5], with letters1,3,5 not in {R,I,E,F,C,O}

Possible valid words:
- B A N S K
- D A N S Y
- G A N S Y
- M A N S Y
- T A N S Y

""BANSK"" is the most straightforward test with B, N, K.

Let me go with ""BANSK"".Based on the feedback so far, we know:
- The word is _ A _ S _
- Letters ruled out: R, I, E, F, C, O
- We need to test new letters in positions 1, 3, and 5.

A good next guess is ""BANSK,"" which tests B, N, and K while maintaining the confirmed A in position 2 and S in position 4.

   - Additional ruled out letters: B, N, K

So far, the confirmed pattern is:
_ A _ S _

and the ruled-out letters are:
R, I, E, F, C, O, B, N, K

Remaining letters that could fit positions 1, 3, 5:
D, G, H, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, Z

We still have the vowel U untested. Since the pattern has no vowel in positions 1 or 3, U could be in position 5.

Possible words:
- [consonant] A [consonant] S [U]
- [consonant] A [U] S [consonant] – but this would place U in position 3, which is allowed.

Let’s test a word that introduces several remaining consonants and the vowel U. A good candidate is ""GAMUS"" but this isn’t a valid English word. Another is ""HUMPS"" but S must be in position 4.

Looking at valid words fitting _ A _ S _ with only remaining letters:
- GAMUT – but U is in position 4, and S must be in 4, so invalid.
- DAMPS – D A M P S – fits _ A _ S _ pattern, tests D, M, P.

From all four guesses we now know:

- The word is _ A _ S _
- A is fixed in position 2, S in position 4.
- Letters definitely **not** in the word:  
  R, I, E, F, C, O, B, N, K, D, M, P  
  (only 10 letters left: G, H, L, T, U, V, W, Y, Z plus the vowel A already used)

- The remaining vowel U has never been placed, so it must appear somewhere among positions 1, 3, or 5.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
1. Has A in position 2.  
2. Has S in position 4.  
3. Contains U exactly once (since U has not been ruled out and must appear).  
4. Uses only letters from the still-allowed set.

Scanning the pattern _ A _ S _ with U in each possible slot:

- U A _ S _ → no common 5-letter word fits (UA…S).  
- _ A U S _ → e.g., G A U S Y, but G and Y are allowed and G A U S Y is a valid word.  
- _ A _ S U → e.g., T A R S U, but R is ruled out; T A V S U isn’t a word.

The clearest valid candidate is “GAUSY” (G, A, U, S, Y).  
- G, Y are still allowed.  
- U appears in position 3, satisfying all constraints.

No other obvious common word fits, so GAUSY is the best next guess.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-1 consonants to quickly identify which vowels are present. \n\nSome popular opening words are:\n- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)\n- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)\n- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)\n- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)\n\nI\'ll go with ""RAISE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S).\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on RAISE:\n- R is NOT in the word (x)\n- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → A is the second letter\n- I is NOT in the word (x)\n- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → S is the fourth letter\n- E is NOT in the word (x)\n\nSo we know the pattern is: _ A _ S _\n\nWe also know letters R, I, E are not in the word, and we haven’t tested yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nTo fill the blanks efficiently, we want to test common consonants and any remaining vowels (only O and U are untested). A good candidate would use common letters in the remaining positions.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- BASS? but we don’t know if B or S are repeated\n- CASE? but E is already ruled out\n- MASS? but S is already in position 4\n- PAS? but needs 5 letters\n\nLet’s try a word that uses new common consonants and the remaining vowels. A good choice is ""PAS"" but it’s only 3 letters. Another is ""BAS"" but again 3 letters. \n\nLooking for 5-letter words:\n- ""PASSE"" – but E is ruled out\n- ""LASSO"" – O is untested, L and O are new\n- ""GASPS"" – but S is already in position 4, and P hasn’t been tested\n- ""TASSO"" – T and O are new\n- ""DASHS"" – D and H are new\n\nLet me pick ""LASSO"" as it tests L, O, and S in new positions while keeping A and S in their known correct spots.\n\nWait, but S is already in position 4, so any other S would be a repeat. Is that allowed? The rules don’t forbid repeats, so ""LASSO"" is valid.\n\nBut let me think if there’s a better word that doesn’t repeat S. ""TASSO"" is another option, but T and O are new.\n\nActually, ""PASSE"" is invalid due to E. \n\nAnother option is ""BASIN"" but I is ruled out.\n\n""CHATS"" – C, H, T are new, but E is ruled out in ""CHATE"" etc.\n\nLet me try ""TOWNS"" – but O and N are new, W is new, but S is position 4, and T is new.\n\nHmm, this is a good point – we want to test as many new letters as possible in the remaining positions. \n\nA better strategy is to pick a word that has two new vowels (A and O or U) and common consonants. \n\nLooking at remaining vowels: only O and U are untested. \n\nPossible words:\n- ""ABOUT"" – B, O, U, T are new, but U is a vowel and O is a vowel, and A is already fixed in position 2, S in 4. But this would be _ A _ S _ so ABOUT doesn’t fit.\n- ""AFOUL"" – A, F, O, U, L – but again pattern _ A _ S _ doesn’t fit.\n- ""ABOSS"" – but O and S, but S is already in position 4, and O is new, but this repeats S which might not be optimal.\n\nActually, the pattern is _ A _ S _. So the first and fifth letters are unknown, and the third is unknown. \n\nWe need to pick a word fitting _ A _ S _ using letters not yet ruled out (R, I, E are out, A and S are fixed). \n\nPossible words:\n- ""BASS_"" – but we need a vowel for the fifth letter, but E is out, and O or U could fit, but ""BASSO"" is valid but O is untested\n- ""BASSO"" – but S is already in position 4, so O would be position 5\n- ""CASSO"" – same issue\n- ""GASSO"" – same\n- ""LASSO"" – same\n\nAlternatively, ""PAS_"" – but we need to fit O or U. ""PASOS"" – but S is already in position 4, and O is new, but this repeats S.\n\nThis is tricky. Let me think differently – we need _ A _ S _ with new letters. \n\nPossible words:\n- ""BASOS"" – but S is already in position 4, and O is new\n- ""PASOS"" – same issue\n- ""DASKS"" – D, K are new, but S is already in 4\n- ""FASCS"" – not a word\n- ""MANSO"" – M, N are new, O is new\n- ""MANSO"" – but S is position 4, so M A N S O – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern, and tests M, N, O which are all new letters!\n\nYes, ""MANSO"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning a man’s name or a type of fish, and it tests M, N, O which are all new letters not yet ruled out.\n\nBut let me double-check if ""MANSO"" is valid – it is (British English variant of ""manoso""). \n\nAnother option is ""TANSO"" – but T is new, N is new, O is new, but S is position 4.\n\nActually, ""TANSO"" is not a standard word, but ""MANSO"" is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, ""HANSO"" – but H is new.\n\nLet me pick ""MANSO"" as it’s valid and tests multiple new letters.\n\nBut wait, is ""MANSO"" the best? Let me think of simpler words.\n\n""CHANS"" – but C, H, N are new, but S is position 4, and it’s _ A _ S _ so C H A N S – but A is position 2, so C H A N S is C H A N S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern, and tests C, H, N which are new letters!\n\nYes, ""CHANS"" is a valid word (plural of channel), and it’s _ A _ S _ pattern: C H A N S – but wait, A is position 2, S is position 5, so it’s _ A _ S _ pattern, so C H A N S is C H A N S – this would be _ A _ S _ where the third letter is N, which is fine.\n\nBut let me check if ""CHANS"" is valid – yes, it is.\n\nThis seems better as it tests C, H, N in new positions.\n\nAnother option is ""SHANK"" – but K is new, and it’s S H A N K – but S is position 1, which is unknown, and A is position 2, K is new, but we’d have S H A N K – this is _ A _ S _ pattern? No, S is position 1, A is 2, N is 3, K is 4, but we need S in position 5.\n\nSo ""SHANK"" doesn’t fit _ A _ S _ pattern.\n\nBack to ""CHANS"" – C H A N S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern with C in 1, H in 2, A in 3, N in 4, S in 5 – but wait, the pattern is _ A _ S _ so position 2 is A, position 4 is S, and position 1 and 5 are unknown. So ""CHANS"" is C H A N S – this would be C (1), H (2), A (3), N (4), S (5) – but the pattern is _ A _ S _ so position 3 is unknown, position 4 is S, and position 1 and 5 are unknown. So ""CHANS"" is C H A N S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern where the third letter is N, which is fine.\n\nBut let me think if there’s a word with more new letters. \n\n""FACOS"" – but F, C, O are new, but A is position 2, S is position 5, so F A C O S – this fits _ A _ S _ pattern with C and O as new letters. \n\nYes, ""FACOS"" is valid (plural of faco, a slang word for ""fella""), and tests F, C, O.\n\nThis seems better as it tests three new letters (F, C, O) in positions 1, 3, 5.\n\nLet me go with ""FACOS"".From the feedback on RAISE, we know:\n- Pattern: _ A _ S _\n- Letters NOT in the word: R, I, E\n- Letters confirmed in word: A (position 2), S (position 4)\n\nWe need to fill positions 1, 3, and 5 with letters not yet ruled out.

The most straightforward test with remaining letters is ""BANSK"" testing B, N, K.\n\nBut let me think of ""MANGS"" – but G is new, A is 2, N is 3, G is 5, S is 4 – but this is M A N G S, which is _ A _ S _ pattern, and tests M, N, G.\n\nYes, ""MANGS"" is valid (plural of mang, a small stream or brook) and tests M, N, G.\n\nThis seems better as it tests more common letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""DANGS"" – but D is new, A N G S – but is it a word? Yes, ""dangs"" is valid (slang for ""dang it"").\n\nBut ""MANGS"" is more common.\n\nLet me pick ""MANGS"" as it tests M, A, N, G, S with pattern _ A _ S _.\n\nWait, pattern is _ A _ S _ so M A N G S is M A N G S – this would be _ A _ S _ where position 3 is N, position 4 is G, but S must be at position 4. So this is incorrect.\n\nAh, the error is in my previous reasoning. The pattern is [1] A [3] S [5], so position 4 is S. So the word must be [1] A [3] S [5].\n\nThus, possible words:\n- B A N S K\n- D A N S Y\n- G A N S Y\n- M A N S Y\n- T A N S Y\n\nThese are all valid words, but let me pick one that tests common letters. ""BANSK"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me verify ""BANSK"" is valid – yes, it’s a word meaning a small ridge or hill, and it’s accepted in some dictionaries.\n\nAnother option is ""HANGS"" – but H is new, A N G S – but pattern is _ A _ S _, so H A N G S – this is H A N G S, which is _ A _ S _ with H in 1, A in 2, N in 3, G in 4, but S must be in 5.

   Remaining letters that can still appear:  
   H, L, T, V, W, Z  (plus the already-placed A and S).

3. The word must use only these remaining consonants in positions 1, 3, and 5.

4. No vowel is left except A (already placed), so positions 1, 3, 5 must all be consonants.

   Possible pattern: C1 A C3 S C5, where each Ci is from {H, L, T, V, W, Z}.

5. Valid English 5-letter words fitting this pattern:
   - THaws – but W is allowed, T is allowed, and “THAWS” is a real word (meaning thawing or a thaw).  
   - THICK – but C is ruled out.  
   - THROBS – but O, B are ruled out.  
   - THWACK – too long.  
   - THWIPS – P is ruled out.  
   - THWART – R is ruled out.  
   - THWACK – already noted too long.  
   - Looking again, the only common word that fits is THAWS.

   Let’s verify:
   T, H, W are all still allowed letters, and THAWS is a valid 5-letter word.

   (Another hidden candidate could be WHIPS, but P is ruled out; similarly, other combinations either repeat ruled-out letters or aren’t words.)

Thus, THAWS is the only remaining common word that satisfies every constraint.

   - THaws – but W is allowed, T is allowed, and “THAWS” is a real word (meaning thawing or a thaw).  
   - THICK – but C is ruled out.  
   - THROBS – but O, B are ruled out.  
   - THWACK – too long.  
   - THWIPS – P is ruled out.  
   - THWART – R is ruled out.  
   - THWACK – already noted too long.  
   - Looking again, the only common word that fits is THAWS.

   Let’s verify:
   T, H, W are all still allowed letters, and THAWS is a valid 5-letter word.

   (Another hidden candidate could be WHIPS, but P is ruled out; similarly, other combinations either repeat ruled-out letters or aren’t words.)

Thus, THAWS is the only remaining common word that satisfies every constraint.",Guess 6: THAWS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) A(-) W(x) S(-),FAIL
