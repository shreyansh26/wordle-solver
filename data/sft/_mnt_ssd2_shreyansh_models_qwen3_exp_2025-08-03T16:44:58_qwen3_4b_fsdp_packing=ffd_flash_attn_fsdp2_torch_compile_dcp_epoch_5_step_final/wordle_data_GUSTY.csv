For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should have a mix of these vowels and consonants. 

Some popular strong starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRATE (C, R, A, T, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's widely considered a good starting word due to its use of very common letters in different positions.

All five letters in CRANE are not in the secret word at all.  
So we need a 5-letter word that uses none of C, R, A, N, E.

Letters still available include: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good second guess should:
1. Use entirely new letters (no C,R,A,N,E)
2. Include several common remaining consonants and vowels
3. Avoid repeating letters to test more possibilities

Good candidates:
- STOMP (S, T, O, M, P) – tests S, T, O, M, P
- BLIMP (B, L, I, M, P) – tests B, L, I, M, P
- GUMMY – but G, U, M, M, Y repeats M
- SHOUL – but O, U, L are good, but S is already in CRANE (no, S is not in CRANE feedback)

I'll choose ""STOMP"" because it uses five entirely new common letters and gives good coverage.

Current known information:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, O, M, P
- Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: S, T

So the secret word contains:
- S and T (but not in their current positions: S not in 1st place, T not in 2nd place)
- No C, R, A, N, E, O, M, P

Available letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and T
2. Doesn't use any of the excluded letters
3. Places S not in 1st position and T not in 2nd position

Possible words:
- LISTS – but contains L, I, S, T, S. S is in 1st and 4th positions (we don't know if S can be in 4th, but we know it can't be in 1st). Also, L and I are new letters.
- BUSTS – but contains B, U, S, T, S. S is in 3rd and 5th positions (both allowed since only 1st was excluded). U is new.
- DUSTS – similar to above, D, U, S, T, S
- FISTS – F, I, S, T, S
- HUSTS – H, U, S, T, S
- KISTS – K, I, S, T, S
- LISTS – already considered
- MISTS – but M is excluded
- GISTS – G, I, S, T, S

Among these, ""LISTS"" seems good because it introduces new letters (L, I) and places S in 4th and T in 3rd (both positions not yet ruled out). However, we might want to test more unique positions for S and T to narrow down faster.

Another option is ""BUSTS"" which places S in 3rd and T in 2nd, but T cannot be in 2nd (from STOMP feedback). So ""BUSTS"" is invalid.

""DUSTS"" would place S in 3rd and T in 2nd – same issue.

""FISTS"" places S in 3rd and T in 2nd – same issue.

""HUSTS"" same issue.

""GISTS"" same issue.

So we need S not in 1st and T not in 2nd. Possible valid placements:
- S could be in 2,3,4,5
- T could be in 1,3,4,5 (but not 2)

Looking for words:
- ""BUSTS"" is invalid (T in 2nd)
- ""DUSTS"" invalid
- ""FISTS"" invalid
- ""HUSTS"" invalid
- ""LISTS"" has T in 4th and S in 3rd – valid (T not in 2nd, S not in 1st)
- ""KISTS"" has T in 4th and S in 3rd – valid
- ""GISTS"" has T in 4th and S in 3rd – valid

""LISTS"" seems like the most common word among these options.

But let me think of others:
- ""USTLY"" – but doesn't have S
- ""STULK"" – but S is 1st (invalid)
- ""TULIP"" – but P is excluded
- ""TULKS"" – T, U, L, K, S: T in 1st, S in 5th. This is valid (T not in 2nd, S not in 1st). U, L, K are new letters.

""TULKS"" seems good as it tests T in 1st, S in 5th, plus U, L, K.

But is ""TULKS"" a valid word? It's a plural of ""tulk"" which is a unit of length in some contexts, but might be obscure.

""LISTS"" is more common.

Another option is ""USTED"" – but E is excluded.

""ISTS"" are plural, but we need 5 letters.

""FITS"" are 4 letters.

""BITS"" are 4 letters.

""KITS"" are 4 letters.

So back to ""LISTS"" or ""TULKS"".

""TULKS"" is probably better as it tests more new letters (U, L, K) in different positions.

But let me check ""LISTS"":
- L: new
- I: new
- S: in 3rd (valid)
- T: in 4th (valid)
- T: repeated, but that's okay

""LISTS"" seems the safest choice.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should have a mix of these vowels and consonants. 

Some popular strong starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRATE (C, R, A, T, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

So we need a 5-letter word that uses none of C, R, A, N, E.

Letters still available include: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good second guess should:
1. Use entirely new letters (no C,R,A,N,E)
2. Include several common remaining consonants and vowels
3. Avoid repeating letters to test more possibilities

Good candidates:
- STOMP (S, T, O, M, P) – tests S, T, O, M, P
- BLIMP (B, L, I, M, P) – tests B, L, I, M, P
- GUMMY – but G, U, M, M, Y repeats M
- SHOUL – but O, U, L are good, but S is already in CRANE (no, S is not in CRANE feedback)

I'll choose ""STOMP"" because it uses five entirely new common letters and gives good coverage.

Current known information:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, O, M, P
- Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: S, T

So the secret word contains:
- S and T (but not in their current positions: S not in 1st place, T not in 2nd place)
- No C, R, A, N, E, O, M, P

Available letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and T
2. Doesn't use any of the excluded letters
3. Places S not in 1st position and T not in 2nd position

Possible words:
- LISTS – but contains L, I, S, T, S. S is in 1st and 4th positions (we don't know if S can be in 4th, but we know it can't be in 1st). Also, L and I are new letters.
- BUSTS – but contains B, U, S, T, S. S is in 3rd and 5th positions (both allowed since only 1st was excluded). U is new.
- DUSTS – similar to above, D, U, S, T, S
- FISTS – F, I, S, T, S
- HUSTS – H, U, S, T, S
- KISTS – K, I, S, T, S
- LISTS – already considered
- MISTS – but M is excluded
- GISTS – G, I, S, T, S

Among these, ""LISTS"" seems good because it introduces new letters (L, I) and places S in 4th and T in 3rd (both positions not yet ruled out). However, we might want to test more unique positions for S and T to narrow down faster.

Another option is ""BUSTS"" which places S in 3rd and T in 2nd, but T cannot be in 2nd (from STOMP feedback). So ""BUSTS"" is invalid.

""DUSTS"" would place S in 3rd and T in 2nd – same issue.

""FISTS"" places S in 3rd and T in 2nd – same issue.

""HUSTS"" same issue.

""GISTS"" same issue.

So we need S not in 1st and T not in 2nd. Possible valid placements:
- S could be in 2,3,4,5
- T could be in 1,3,4,5 (but not 2)

Looking for words:
- ""BUSTS"" is invalid (T in 2nd)
- ""DUSTS"" invalid
- ""FISTS"" invalid
- ""HUSTS"" invalid
- ""LISTS"" has T in 4th and S in 3rd – valid (T not in 2nd, S not in 1st)
- ""KISTS"" has T in 4th and S in 3rd – valid
- ""GISTS"" has T in 4th and S in 3rd – valid

""LISTS"" seems like the most common word among these options.

But let me think of others:
- ""USTLY"" – but doesn't have S
- ""STULK"" – but S is 1st (invalid)
- ""TULIP"" – but P is excluded
- ""TULKS"" – T, U, L, K, S: T in 1st, S in 5th. This is valid (T not in 2nd, S not in 1st). U, L, K are new letters.

""TULKS"" seems good as it tests T in 1st, S in 5th, plus U, L, K.

But is ""TULKS"" a valid word? It's a plural of ""tulk"" which is a unit of length in some contexts, but might be obscure.

""LISTS"" is more common.

Another option is ""USTED"" – but E is excluded.

""ISTS"" are plural, but we need 5 letters.

""FITS"" are 4 letters.

""BITS"" are 4 letters.

""KITS"" are 4 letters.

So back to ""LISTS"" or ""TULKS"".

""TULKS"" is probably better as it tests more new letters (U, L, K) in different positions.

But let me check ""LISTS"":
- L: new
- I: new
- S: in 3rd (valid)
- T: in 4th (valid)
- T: repeated, but that's okay

""LISTS"" seems the safest choice.

Let's break down the new feedback:

1. Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, O, M, P, L, I  
   (from guesses 1–3)

2. Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct positions:
   - S is in position 3 (✓)  
   - T is in position 4 (✓)

3. Additional information:
   - The second S in position 5 is in the word but in the wrong position (–).  
     This means the word has exactly one S (in position 3) and the other S in LISTS is a duplicate letter that doesn’t appear elsewhere.  
     So the word contains S once and T once.

4. Available letters left:  
   B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
   (plus the confirmed S and T)

5. Word skeleton so far:  
   _ _ S T _

We need a 5-letter word that:
   - Uses S in position 3 and T in position 4 exactly.  
   - Contains no forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E, O, M, P, L, I).  
   - Has no other S besides the one in position 3.

Possible vowels remaining: U, Y (sometimes).  
Possible consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s brainstorm candidates:

   - B U S T S  → but the last S is extra and must be avoided.  
   - F U S T S  → same issue.  
   - G U S T S  → same issue.  
   - H U S T S  → same issue.  
   - B U S T Y  → ends in Y, but Y is vowel-like.  
   - F U S T Y  → same.  
   - G U S T Y  → same.  
   - H U S T Y  → same.

Another approach: the word must be _ _ S T _ with the fifth letter not S, and no forbidden letters.  
Possible letters for the last position: D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   - B U S T D  → ""BUSTD"" – not a word.  
   - F U S T D  → ""FUSTD"" – not a word.  
   - H U S T D  → ""HUSTD"" – not a word.  
   - B U S T K  → ""BUSTK"" – not a word.  
   - H U S T K  → ""HUSTK"" – not a word.  
   - B U S T Y  → ""BUSTY"" – valid word, ends in Y.  
   - F U S T Y  → ""FUSTY"" – not common.  
   - G U S T Y  → ""GUSTY"" – valid word.  
   - H U S T Y  → ""HUSTY"" – valid word.

Among these, ""GUSTY"" and ""HUSTY"" are both common. ""GUSTY"" uses G, U, S, T, Y – all allowed letters.  
So let’s go with ""GUSTY"".
