### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should have a mix of these vowels and consonants. 

Some popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (lots of vowels)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers several very common letters and has a good balance of vowels and consonants.

Let's break down what we now know:

1. E is fixed in the 5th position: _ _ _ _ E
2. O is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (it moved from 3rd to now being “-” instead of “✓”).
3. D is in the word and is in the correct 1st position: D _ _ _ E
4. I is in the word but NOT in the 4th position.
5. Letters definitely out: S, L, A, T, C, R, N, G

So far we have:
D _ _ _ E
with O and I somewhere in positions 2 or 3 or 4, and no other letters already used.

Possible remaining consonants: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A and E are used, O is in the word)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with D
- Ends with E
- Contains both O and I
- Doesn't use any of the ruled-out letters
- Doesn't put O in the 3rd position
- Doesn't put I in the 4th position

Let's list some possibilities:

D I O _ E → but we need a 5-letter word, so the last two letters must be EO, but that would be D I O E (only 4 letters). Doesn't work.

D _ O I E → but I would be in 4th position, which is not allowed.

D _ I O E → but O would be 4th, which is allowed, and I would be 3rd. This gives us D _ I O E.

Looking at valid English words that fit D _ I O E:
- DIODE → uses letters D, I, O, D, E. All letters are allowed so far.
- DITOE → not a valid word.
- DIOBE → not valid.
- DIMEO → not valid.

DIODE is a valid word and fits all constraints:
- D ✓ (1st position)
- I in 3rd position (allowed)
- O in 4th position (allowed, since it wasn't in 3rd position before)
- D and E are already confirmed letters

Let's try DIODE.
