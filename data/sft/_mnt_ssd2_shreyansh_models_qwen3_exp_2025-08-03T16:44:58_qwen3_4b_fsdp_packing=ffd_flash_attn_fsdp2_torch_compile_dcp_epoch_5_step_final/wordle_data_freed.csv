### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should have a mix of these vowels and consonants. ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains S, L, A, T, and E - covering several common letters and multiple vowels. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word.

- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 5).

So we know:
- The word contains E somewhere other than the last position.
- It does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Has E in a different position (positions 1-4).
2. Uses other common letters not yet ruled out.
3. Avoids S, L, A, T entirely.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, B, M, H, G, K, F, V, W, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: E (already known), I, O, U

I’ll pick a word that places E in position 2 or 3 and uses other frequent consonants and vowels.  
""CRONE"" uses C, R, O, N, E – avoids S, L, A, T and moves E to position 5 again, but that’s still wrong for E.  
""NERVE"" uses N, E, R, V, E – but E is still at 5 and 4, both wrong.  
""PERKY"" uses P, E, R, K, Y – but Y is uncommon and K is later.  
""DRIVE"" uses D, R, I, V, E – E is at 5 again.  
""BRICK"" uses B, R, I, C, K – no E.  
""CRIMP"" uses C, R, I, M, P – no E.  
""GRIME"" uses G, R, I, M, E – E is at 5 (still wrong).  
""PRIED"" uses P, R, I, E, D – E is at 4, which is acceptable (not last), and introduces P, R, I, D.

""PRIED"" seems good:  
- E is in position 4 (not 5, so matches the feedback).  
- Uses P, R, I, D – none of which are ruled out.  
- Avoids S, L, A, T.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should have a mix of these vowels and consonants.

- It does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Has E in a different position (positions 1-4).
2. Uses other common letters not yet ruled out.
3. Avoids S, L, A, T entirely.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, B, M, H, G, K, F, V, W, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: E (already known), I, O, U

I’ll pick a word that places E in position 2 or 3 and uses other frequent consonants and vowels.  
""CRONE"" uses C, R, O, N, E – avoids S, L, A, T and moves E to position 5 again, but that’s still wrong for E.  
""NERVE"" uses N, E, R, V, E – but E is still at 5 and 4, both wrong.  
""PERKY"" uses P, E, R, K, Y – but Y is uncommon and K is later.  
""DRIVE"" uses D, R, I, V, E – E is at 5 again.  
""BRICK"" uses B, R, I, C, K – no E.  
""CRIMP"" uses C, R, I, M, P – no E.  
""GRIME"" uses G, R, I, M, E – E is at 5 (still wrong).  
""PRIED"" uses P, R, I, E, D – E is at 4, which is acceptable (not last), and introduces P, R, I, D.

""PRIED"" seems good:  
- E is in position 4 (not 5, so matches the feedback).  
- Uses P, R, I, D – none of which are ruled out.  
- Avoids S, L, A, T.

Let’s go with that.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters **not** in the word: S, L, A, T, P, I**  
- Letters **confirmed** in the word and in the correct positions:  
  – R in position 2  
  – E in position 4  
  – D in position 5  

So the pattern is:  
_ R _ E D

Remaining unused common letters (excluding the ruled-out set):  
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in position 2.
2. Has E in position 4.
3. Has D in position 5.
4. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
5. Has valid combinations for positions 1 and 3.

Possible combinations for position 1 (before R):  
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible combinations for position 3 (between R and E):  
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s list some words that fit _ R _ E D:

- U R E E D  
- V R E E D  
- W R E E D  
- X R E E D  
- Y R E E D

Among these, **BREED, CREED, FREED, GREED, HORED** (not a word), **NORED** (not a word), etc. The valid English words are:

The most common valid word is **BREED**.

E – confirmed position 4  
E – allowed (double E)  
D – confirmed position 5

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should have a mix of these vowels and consonants. ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains S, L, A, T, and E - covering several common letters and multiple vowels. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 5).

So we know:
- The word contains E somewhere other than the last position.
- It does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Has E in a different position (positions 1-4).
2. Uses other common letters not yet ruled out.
3. Avoids S, L, A, T entirely.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, B, M, H, G, K, F, V, W, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: E (already known), I, O, U

I’ll pick a word that places E in position 2 or 3 and uses other frequent consonants and vowels.  
""CRONE"" uses C, R, O, N, E – avoids S, L, A, T and moves E to position 5 again, but that’s still wrong for E.  
""NERVE"" uses N, E, R, V, E – but E is still at 5 and 4, both wrong.  
""PERKY"" uses P, E, R, K, Y – but Y is uncommon and K is later.  
""DRIVE"" uses D, R, I, V, E – E is at 5 again.  
""BRICK"" uses B, R, I, C, K – no E.  
""CRIMP"" uses C, R, I, M, P – no E.  
""GRIME"" uses G, R, I, M, E – E is at 5 (still wrong).  
""PRIED"" uses P, R, I, E, D – E is at 4, which is acceptable (not last), and introduces P, R, I, D.

""PRIED"" seems good:  
- E is in position 4 (not 5, so matches the feedback).  
- Uses P, R, I, D – none of which are ruled out.  
- Avoids S, L, A, T.
