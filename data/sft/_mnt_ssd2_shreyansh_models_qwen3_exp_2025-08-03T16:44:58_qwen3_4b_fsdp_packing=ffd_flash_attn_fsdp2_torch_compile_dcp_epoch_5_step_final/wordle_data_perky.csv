### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Words with frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, O, I, and C are good choices. A strong starting word should also avoid repetition of letters to test as many unique letters as possible.

One of the most common and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E) without any repetitions. This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word and gathering useful feedback.

Another good alternative would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong with its combination of vowels and common consonants.

   - Additional letters known to be absent: I, N, T
   - R is still “in the word but wrong position” (so R cannot be in position 2 or 5)
   - E is still “in the word but wrong position” (so E cannot be in position 4 or 5)

Summary of constraints:
- Must contain: R and E
- Must not contain: A, O, S, I, N, T
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 5
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining common vowels: U (only one left)

We need a 5-letter word that uses only the allowed letters and satisfies the positional restrictions.  
Let’s try to place R and E in allowed spots while introducing new letters.

Possible positions:
- R: 1, 3, 4
- E: 1, 2, 3, 4

Let’s try “CREEK”:
- C (new letter)
- R (allowed in position 2? No, R cannot be in position 2 from AROSE feedback) → reject.

Try “FRESH”:
- F (new)
- R (position 2 → not allowed) → reject.

Try “PERCH”:
- P (new)
- E (position 2)
- R (position 3 – allowed)
- C (new)
- H (new)
Checks:
- Contains R and E ✓
- No forbidden letters (A,O,S,I,N,T) ✓
- R is in position 3 (allowed) ✓
- E is in position 2 (allowed) ✓
“PERCH” seems valid.

Another quick check against constraints:
Letters: P, E, R, C, H  
All are allowed by current constraints.

So the next guess is PERCH.

We now have very precise information.

From the three guesses:

2. INTER → I(x) N(x) T(x) E(-) R(-)

   - C and H are not in the word.

So the pattern is now:

Known facts:

- Letters already ruled out: A, O, S, I, N, T, C, H
- Remaining unused letters (common ones): B, D, F, G, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y, Z
- E is already in position 2, so no more E elsewhere
- We still need two more letters (positions 4 and 5) that are not yet excluded.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Words with frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, O, I, and C are good choices. A strong starting word should also avoid repetition of letters to test as many unique letters as possible.

One of the most common and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E) without any repetitions. This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word and gathering useful feedback.

Another good alternative would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong with its combination of vowels and common consonants.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a broad coverage of common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is NOT in the word (x)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: A, O, S
- Letters that MUST appear somewhere: R, E
- R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and E (since they are in the word but in wrong positions)
2. Does not contain A, O, S
3. R cannot be in position 2
4. E cannot be in position 5

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, G, B, F, etc.
Good remaining vowels to try: I, U (since A and O are out)

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 4

Let's try to construct a word that places R and E in new positions while introducing new letters. A good candidate is ""INTER"":
- I (new letter)
- N (new letter)
- T (new letter)
- E (in position 4, not 5)
- R (in position 5, not 2)

This satisfies all constraints and tests new letters (I, N, T) while repositioning R and E.

I made a mistake: “PERL” is only four letters.  
We need a 5-letter word that starts with “PER” and ends with any letter except C, H, A, O, S, I, N, T.

Common 5-letter “PER” words:
- PERKY  
- PERKY (ends in K, not yet ruled out)  
- PERKY is valid and uses K, which is still allowed.

Check constraints:
P(✓) E(✓) R(✓) K(x?) – K has not been excluded yet.  
All letters are allowed.

So the next guess should be PERKY.
