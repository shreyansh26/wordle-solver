For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. The goal is to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to test as many unique letters as possible

One of the most effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- Good letter positioning that can help identify correct placements

This gives us maximum coverage of frequent letters in strategic positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The secret word contains A and R, but not O, S, or E.
- A cannot be in position 1, R cannot be in position 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and R.
2. Does not contain O, S, or E.
3. Has A not in position 1 and R not in position 2.

Let’s think of words that fit these constraints. Good candidates would use other common letters not yet ruled out (like T, I, N, L, etc.). 

One such word is ""TRAIN"":
- Contains A and R.
- Does not contain O, S, or E.
- A is in position 3 (not 1), R is in position 2 (but we know R cannot be in position 2 from the feedback), so this is invalid.

Another candidate is ""DRAIN"":
- Contains A and R.
- Does not contain O, S, or E.
- A is in position 2 (not 1), R is in position 4 (not 2). This seems valid.

Let’s check ""DRAIN"":
- Letters: D, R, A, I, N.
- No O, S, or E.
- A is in position 2 (allowed), R is in position 4 (allowed).

Guess 2: DRAIN -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. DRAIN → D(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - D, I, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (confirmed again).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (because in DRAIN it was marked “-” while in position 3).

So we now know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R.
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S, E, D, I, N.
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
  – R cannot be in position 2.

Remaining common letters (not yet eliminated): B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word using only letters from the allowed set, containing both A and R, with A not in pos 1 or 3, and R not in pos 2.

Let’s list possible placements:
- A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2).

Candidate words:
- CARGO: uses C, A, R, G, O → O is invalid.
- FARTY: uses F, A, R, T, Y → all letters allowed, and positions: A in 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed).
- LARKS: uses L, A, R, K, S → S is invalid.
- MARRY: uses M, A, R, R, Y → R is allowed in positions 1,3,4,5; A is allowed in 2,4,5. But M and Y are allowed, and it contains both A and R. However, it has R twice, which might be okay, but let’s see if we can find a word with unique letters first.

“FARTY” seems good: all letters allowed, no duplicates, A in 2, R in 3.

Let’s check: F, A, R, T, Y — none are in the banned list, and it satisfies the positional constraints.

So the next guess is FARTY.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. The goal is to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to test as many unique letters as possible

One of the most effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- Good letter positioning that can help identify correct placements

This gives us maximum coverage of frequent letters in strategic positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The secret word contains A and R, but not O, S, or E.
- A cannot be in position 1, R cannot be in position 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and R.
2. Does not contain O, S, or E.
3. Has A not in position 1 and R not in position 2.

Let’s think of words that fit these constraints. Good candidates would use other common letters not yet ruled out (like T, I, N, L, etc.). 

One such word is ""TRAIN"":
- Contains A and R.
- Does not contain O, S, or E.
- A is in position 3 (not 1), R is in position 2 (but we know R cannot be in position 2 from the feedback), so this is invalid.

Another candidate is ""DRAIN"":
- Contains A and R.
- Does not contain O, S, or E.
- A is in position 2 (not 1), R is in position 4 (not 2). This seems valid.

Let’s check ""DRAIN"":
- Letters: D, R, A, I, N.
- No O, S, or E.
- A is in position 2 (allowed), R is in position 4 (allowed).

This looks like a good next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. The goal is to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to test as many unique letters as possible

One of the most effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- Good letter positioning that can help identify correct placements

This gives us maximum coverage of frequent letters in strategic positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The secret word contains A and R, but not O, S, or E.
- A cannot be in position 1, R cannot be in position 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and R.
2. Does not contain O, S, or E.
3. Has A not in position 1 and R not in position 2.

Let’s think of words that fit these constraints. Good candidates would use other common letters not yet ruled out (like T, I, N, L, etc.). 

One such word is ""TRAIN"":
- Contains A and R.
- Does not contain O, S, or E.
- A is in position 3 (not 1), R is in position 2 (but we know R cannot be in position 2 from the feedback), so this is invalid.

Another candidate is ""DRAIN"":
- Contains A and R.
- Does not contain O, S, or E.
- A is in position 2 (not 1), R is in position 4 (not 2). This seems valid.

Let’s check ""DRAIN"":
- Letters: D, R, A, I, N.
- No O, S, or E.
- A is in position 2 (allowed), R is in position 4 (allowed).

This looks like a good next guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: DRAIN -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. DRAIN → D(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - D, I, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (confirmed again).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (because in DRAIN it was marked “-” while in position 3).

So we now know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R.
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S, E, D, I, N.
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
  – R cannot be in position 2.

Remaining common letters (not yet eliminated): B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word using only letters from the allowed set, containing both A and R, with A not in pos 1 or 3, and R not in pos 2.

Let’s list possible placements:
- A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2).

Candidate words:
- CARGO: uses C, A, R, G, O → O is invalid.
- FARTY: uses F, A, R, T, Y → all letters allowed, and positions: A in 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed).
- LARKS: uses L, A, R, K, S → S is invalid.
- MARRY: uses M, A, R, R, Y → R is allowed in positions 1,3,4,5; A is allowed in 2,4,5. But M and Y are allowed, and it contains both A and R. However, it has R twice, which might be okay, but let’s see if we can find a word with unique letters first.

“FARTY” seems good: all letters allowed, no duplicates, A in 2, R in 3.

Let’s check: F, A, R, T, Y — none are in the banned list, and it satisfies the positional constraints.

So the next guess is FARTY.

  – A is in position 2  
  – R is in position 3  
  – Y is in position 5  

- Letters NOT in the word at all:  
  O, S, E, D, I, N, F, T

We still need letters for positions 1 and 4.  
Allowed letters (not yet eliminated): B, C, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

We need two more letters such that:
- Position 1: any allowed consonant (cannot be A, R, Y)
- Position 4: any allowed consonant (cannot be A, R, Y)

Also, the word must be valid 5-letter English.

Candidate combinations for positions 1 and 4:
- C & K → C A R K Y  (but K would be in position 4, giving C A R K Y) — is CARKY a word? No.
- B & K → B A R K Y — BARKY is a valid word (British English variant of “bargey”).
- P & K → P A R K Y — PARKY is valid.
- C & H → C A R H Y — CARHY is not valid.
- G & K → G A R K Y — GARFY is not valid.

BARKY and PARKY are both valid. Between them, BARKY uses B and K, PARKY uses P and K.  
BARKY uses B (common), and PARKY uses P (also common).  
Let’s choose BARKY as it uses B and K, both common letters not yet ruled out.

From the feedback so far:

Letters confirmed:
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: R
- Position 5: Y

Letters eliminated completely:
O, S, E, D, I, N, F, B, K, T, C

Letters whose position is partially known:
- P is in the word but NOT in position 4 (because in CARPY it was marked “-” while in position 4). So P must be in position 1.

So the pattern is now:
P A R _ Y

Only position 4 is unknown. The remaining letters not yet used or eliminated include:
G, H, L, M, U, V, W, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with P A R and ends with Y.

Common such words:
- PARLY – not valid (not a recognized word)
- PARCY – not valid
- PARRY – valid (a surname and a variant spelling of “perry”)
- PARLY – no
- PARCY – no

The only common valid word fitting P A R _ Y is PARRY.

Let’s check:
- P A R R Y – all letters allowed (P is allowed in position 1, R is confirmed in 3, etc.)
- No eliminated letters are used.
- It’s a valid English word.

So the next logical guess is PARRY.
