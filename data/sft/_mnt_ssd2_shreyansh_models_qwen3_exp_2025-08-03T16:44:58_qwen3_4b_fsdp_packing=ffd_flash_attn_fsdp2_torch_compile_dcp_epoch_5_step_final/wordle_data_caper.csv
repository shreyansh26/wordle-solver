For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage of high-frequency letters in both position and presence.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage of high-frequency letters in both position and presence.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2  
- O(x): O is not in the word at all  
- S(x): S is not in the word at all  
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5  

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the secret word: A, R, E  
- Letters definitely NOT in the secret word: O, S  
- Positions to avoid for those letters:
  - A cannot be in position 1  
  - R cannot be in position 2  
  - E cannot be in position 5  

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, E (all three must appear)  
2. Does NOT contain O or S  
3. Places A, R, E in different positions than their previous positions  
4. Uses only valid English 5-letter words  

Let me think of a word that satisfies these constraints. ""REACT"" comes to mind:
- R is now in position 1 (was in position 2)  
- E is now in position 2 (was in position 5)  
- A is now in position 3 (was in position 1)  
- C and T are new letters that haven’t been tested yet  
- Doesn’t contain O or S  

This seems like a good second guess to narrow down the possibilities.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)

2. REACT → R(-) E(-) A(-) C(-) T(x)  
   – R, E, A, C are in the word but in wrong positions.  
   – T is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, E, C  
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S, T  
- Previous positions to avoid:
  – A: not pos 1, 3  
  – R: not pos 2, 1  
  – E: not pos 5, 2  
  – C: not pos 4

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses only A, R, E, C and one more letter (not O, S, T).  
- Places each of A, R, E, C in positions they have not been in yet.

Let’s list open positions:
- A can be 2, 4, 5  
- R can be 3, 4, 5  
- E can be 1, 3, 4  
- C can be 1, 2, 3

A good candidate is “CEARA” but that’s not a valid English word.  
“CARES” contains S (invalid).  
“REACH” contains H (new letter).  
Let’s check positions:
- R: 1 (allowed)  
- E: 2 (allowed)  
- A: 3 (allowed)  
- C: 4 (allowed)  
- H: 5 (new letter)

“REACH” uses R, E, A, C, H and puts each of the known letters in previously untested positions.

So I’ll guess REACH.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – A, R, E are in the word, positions unknown.  
   – O, S are not in the word.

2. REACT → R(-) E(-) A(-) C(-) T(x)  
   – R, E, A, C are in the word, positions unknown.  
   – T is not in the word.

3. REACH → R(-) E(-) A(-) C(-) H(x)  
   – R, E, A, C are in the word, positions unknown.  
   – H is not in the word.

4. CARED → C(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)  
   – C is in position 1.  
   – A is in position 2.  
   – E is in position 4.  
   – R is in the word but not in position 3.  
   – D is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Exact positions: C _ A _ _ with E somewhere in positions 3 or 5.  
- Letters in word: C, A, E, plus R (but R cannot be in position 3).  
- Letters not in word: O, S, T, H, D.

The word structure is: C A _ _ _  
We know E must be in position 3 or 5.  
We also know R must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (but position 2 is already A).  
So R can be in position 4 or 5.

Let’s list possible combinations:
- If E is in position 3: C A E _ _  
  – Then R must be in position 4 or 5.  
  – Possible: C A E R _ or C A E _ R.

- If E is in position 5: C A _ _ E  
  – Then R must be in position 4.  
  – So word would be C A _ R E.

Now let’s pick a valid 5-letter word that fits these patterns and uses only allowed letters.

Try C A E R _ : CAER_ – “CAERU” not valid.  
Try C A E _ R : CAE_R – “CAEPR” not valid.  
Try C A _ R E : CA_R_E – “CABRE” not valid.  
Try C A _ E R : CA_E_R – “CABER” not valid.  
Try C A R _ E : CAR_E – “CARTE” has T (invalid).  
Try C A R E _ : CAR_E_ – “CARES” has S (invalid).

Wait, let’s try C A R E _ again. We know letters not in word: T, H, D, O, S.  
“CARES” has S (invalid).  
“CAREU” not valid.  
“CARER” – valid word.

Check: C A R E R  
Positions: 1=C, 2=A, 3=R (but R cannot be in position 3 from feedback).  
So CARER is invalid.

Another option: C A E R _ – “CAERU” invalid.  
Another: C A E _ R – “CAEPR” invalid.

Wait, let’s try E in position 5: C A _ _ E  
Then R must be in position 4: C A _ R E  
We need a valid word with C A _ R E.  
Possible: C A M R E – “CAMRE” invalid.  
C A N R E – “CANRE” invalid.  
C A P R E – “CAPRE” invalid.  
C A B R E – “CABRE” invalid.  
C A G R E – “CAGRE” invalid.  
C A F R E – “CAFRE” invalid.

Wait, let’s try E in position 3: C A E _ _  
Then R must be in position 5: C A E _ R  
We need a valid word with C A E _ R.  
Possible: C A E N R – “CAENR” invalid.  
C A E D R – D already ruled out.  
C A E T R – T ruled out.  
C A E G R – “CAEGR” invalid.  
C A E P R – “CAEPR” invalid.  
C A E B R – “CAEBR” invalid.

Hmm, let’s think differently.  
We know: C A _ _ _  
We know E must be in position 3 or 5.  
We know R must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (but position 2 is A).  
So R can be in 4 or 5.

Let’s try R in position 4 and E in position 5: C A _ R E  
We need a valid word with C A _ R E.  
The only common one is C A M R E – “CAMRE” not valid.  
Wait, “CABRE” not valid.  
“CAORE” invalid.  
“CAIRE” invalid.  
“CAURE” invalid.

Try R in position 5 and E in position 3: C A E _ R  
We need a valid word with C A E _ R.  
The only common one is C A E P R – “CAEPR” invalid.  
“CAEGR” invalid.  
“CAEBR” invalid.

Wait, let’s try R in position 2: but position 2 is A.

I think the only valid word left is “CARTE” but T is ruled out.

Wait, let’s re-examine:  
We have C A _ _ _  
We know R is in the word but not in position 3.  
We know E is in the word but not in position 5 (from guess 1).  
Wait, from guess 1: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5.  
From guess 2: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 2.  
From guess 3: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 2.  
From guess 4: E(✓) in position 4.  
So E must be in position 4.

Therefore, the word is: C A _ E _  
And R must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (but position 2 is A).  
So R must be in position 3 or 5.

Let’s try R in position 3: C A R E _  
We need a valid word with C A R E _  
The only common one is C A R E D – but D is ruled out.  
C A R E S – S ruled out.  
C A R E T – T ruled out.  
C A R E M – “CAREM” invalid.  
C A R E N – “CAREN” invalid.  
C A R E G – “CAREG” invalid.

Try R in position 5: C A _ E R  
We need a valid word with C A _ E R  
The only common one is C A N E R – “CANER” valid.

Check: C A N E R  
Positions: 1=C (✓), 2=A (✓), 3=N (new), 4=E (✓), 5=R (new).  
Letters used: C, A, N, E, R – all allowed.  
Positions: R is in position 5 (not 3, so allowed).  
This seems valid.

Therefore, the next guess is CANER.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage of high-frequency letters in both position and presence.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2  
- O(x): O is not in the word at all  
- S(x): S is not in the word at all  
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5  

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the secret word: A, R, E  
- Letters definitely NOT in the secret word: O, S  
- Positions to avoid for those letters:
  - A cannot be in position 1  
  - R cannot be in position 2  
  - E cannot be in position 5  

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, E (all three must appear)  
2. Does NOT contain O or S  
3. Places A, R, E in different positions than their previous positions  
4. Uses only valid English 5-letter words  

Let me think of a word that satisfies these constraints. ""REACT"" comes to mind:
- R is now in position 1 (was in position 2)  
- E is now in position 2 (was in position 5)  
- A is now in position 3 (was in position 1)  
- C and T are new letters that haven’t been tested yet  
- Doesn’t contain O or S  

This seems like a good second guess to narrow down the possibilities.

Guess 2: REACT -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) A(-) C(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – A, R, E are in the word but in wrong positions.  
   – O, S are not in the word.

2. REACT → R(-) E(-) A(-) C(-) T(x)  
   – R, E, A, C are in the word but in wrong positions.  
   – T is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, E, C  
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S, T  
- Previous positions to avoid:
  – A: not pos 1, 3  
  – R: not pos 2, 1  
  – E: not pos 5, 2  
  – C: not pos 4

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses only A, R, E, C and one more letter (not O, S, T).  
- Places each of A, R, E, C in positions they have not been in yet.

Let’s list open positions:
- A can be 2, 4, 5  
- R can be 3, 4, 5  
- E can be 1, 3, 4  
- C can be 1, 2, 3

A good candidate is “CEARA” but that’s not a valid English word.  
“CARES” contains S (invalid).  
“REACH” contains H (new letter).  
Let’s check positions:
- R: 1 (allowed)  
- E: 2 (allowed)  
- A: 3 (allowed)  
- C: 4 (allowed)  
- H: 5 (new letter)

“REACH” uses R, E, A, C, H and puts each of the known letters in previously untested positions.

So I’ll guess REACH.

From the three guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – A, R, E are in the word, but in wrong positions.  
   – O, S are not in the word.

2. REACT → R(-) E(-) A(-) C(-) T(x)

3. REACH → R(-) E(-) A(-) C(-) H(x)  
   – R, E, A, C are in the word, but in wrong positions.  
   – H is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, E, C  
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S, T, H  
- Previous positions each of these has occupied:
  – A: 1, 3  
  – R: 2, 1  
  – E: 5, 2  
  – C: 4, 3  

Therefore, the only remaining positions for each are:
- A: 2, 4, 5  
- R: 3, 4, 5  
- E: 1, 3, 4  
- C: 1, 2, 5  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses only A, R, E, C plus one new letter (not O, S, T, H).  
- Places each of A, R, E, C in positions they have not been in yet.

The new letter must be something we haven’t tried. Let’s pick D (it’s common and hasn’t appeared).

Candidate word: “CREAD” – but that’s not valid.  
“CARED” – valid word.

Check positions:
- C: 1 (allowed)  
- A: 2 (allowed)  
- R: 3 (allowed)  
- E: 4 (allowed)  
- D: 5 (new letter)

“CARED” meets all constraints.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – A, R, E are in the word, positions unknown.  
   – O, S are not in the word.

2. REACT → R(-) E(-) A(-) C(-) T(x)

   – A is in position 2.  
   – E is in position 4.  
   – R is in the word but not in position 3.  
   – D is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Exact positions: C _ A _ _ with E somewhere in positions 3 or 5.  
- Letters in word: C, A, E, plus R (but R cannot be in position 3).  
- Letters not in word: O, S, T, H, D.

The word structure is: C A _ _ _  
We know E must be in position 3 or 5.  
We also know R must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (but position 2 is already A).  
So R can be in position 4 or 5.

Let’s list possible combinations:
- If E is in position 3: C A E _ _  
  – Then R must be in position 4 or 5.  
  – Possible: C A E R _ or C A E _ R.

- If E is in position 5: C A _ _ E  
  – Then R must be in position 4.  
  – So word would be C A _ R E.

Now let’s pick a valid 5-letter word that fits these patterns and uses only allowed letters.

Try C A E R _ : CAER_ – “CAERU” not valid.  
Try C A E _ R : CAE_R – “CAEPR” not valid.  
Try C A _ R E : CA_R_E – “CABRE” not valid.  
Try C A _ E R : CA_E_R – “CABER” not valid.  
Try C A R _ E : CAR_E – “CARTE” has T (invalid).  
Try C A R E _ : CAR_E_ – “CARES” has S (invalid).

Wait, let’s try C A R E _ again. We know letters not in word: T, H, D, O, S.  
“CARES” has S (invalid).  
“CAREU” not valid.  
“CARER” – valid word.

Check: C A R E R  
Positions: 1=C, 2=A, 3=R (but R cannot be in position 3 from feedback).  
So CARER is invalid.

Another option: C A E R _ – “CAERU” invalid.  
Another: C A E _ R – “CAEPR” invalid.

Wait, let’s try E in position 5: C A _ _ E  
Then R must be in position 4: C A _ R E  
We need a valid word with C A _ R E.  
Possible: C A M R E – “CAMRE” invalid.  
C A N R E – “CANRE” invalid.  
C A P R E – “CAPRE” invalid.  
C A B R E – “CABRE” invalid.  
C A G R E – “CAGRE” invalid.  
C A F R E – “CAFRE” invalid.

Wait, let’s try E in position 3: C A E _ _  
Then R must be in position 5: C A E _ R  
We need a valid word with C A E _ R.  
Possible: C A E N R – “CAENR” invalid.  
C A E D R – D already ruled out.  
C A E T R – T ruled out.  
C A E G R – “CAEGR” invalid.  
C A E P R – “CAEPR” invalid.  
C A E B R – “CAEBR” invalid.

Hmm, let’s think differently.  
We know: C A _ _ _  
We know E must be in position 3 or 5.  
We know R must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (but position 2 is A).  
So R can be in 4 or 5.

Let’s try R in position 4 and E in position 5: C A _ R E  
We need a valid word with C A _ R E.  
The only common one is C A M R E – “CAMRE” not valid.  
Wait, “CABRE” not valid.  
“CAORE” invalid.  
“CAIRE” invalid.  
“CAURE” invalid.

Try R in position 5 and E in position 3: C A E _ R  
We need a valid word with C A E _ R.  
The only common one is C A E P R – “CAEPR” invalid.  
“CAEGR” invalid.  
“CAEBR” invalid.

Wait, let’s try R in position 2: but position 2 is A.

I think the only valid word left is “CARTE” but T is ruled out.

Wait, let’s re-examine:  
We have C A _ _ _  
We know R is in the word but not in position 3.  
We know E is in the word but not in position 5 (from guess 1).  
Wait, from guess 1: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5.  
From guess 2: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 2.  
From guess 3: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 2.  
From guess 4: E(✓) in position 4.  
So E must be in position 4.

Therefore, the word is: C A _ E _  
And R must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (but position 2 is A).  
So R must be in position 3 or 5.

Let’s try R in position 3: C A R E _  
We need a valid word with C A R E _  
The only common one is C A R E D – but D is ruled out.  
C A R E S – S ruled out.  
C A R E T – T ruled out.  
C A R E M – “CAREM” invalid.  
C A R E N – “CAREN” invalid.  
C A R E G – “CAREG” invalid.

Try R in position 5: C A _ E R  
We need a valid word with C A _ E R  
The only common one is C A N E R – “CANER” valid.

Check: C A N E R  
Positions: 1=C (✓), 2=A (✓), 3=N (new), 4=E (✓), 5=R (new).  
Letters used: C, A, N, E, R – all allowed.
