For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm several possibilities. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it contains frequently used letters (S, L, A, T, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which covers all five of the most common letters in English words. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 2).
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 4).
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: R, O, S
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, E
- R, O, S must appear somewhere other than positions 2, 3, 4 respectively.

A good next guess should:
1. Re-use R, O, S in new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters to narrow things down.
3. Avoid A, E, and the positions already ruled out for R, O, S.

Possible new positions:
- R cannot be in position 2, so try 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- O cannot be in position 3, so try 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- S cannot be in position 4, so try 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s try ""FIRST"":
- F – new letter, common
- I – new letter, common
- R – in position 3 (allowed, since R is only banned from position 2)
- S – in position 4 (not allowed, since S is banned from position 4)

That fails. Let’s try ""ROIST"":
- R – position 1 (allowed)
- O – position 2 (allowed)
- I – new letter
- S – position 4 (banned) – fails again.

Try ""SORRY"":
- S – position 1 (allowed)
- O – position 2 (allowed)
- R – position 3 (allowed)
- R – duplicate, but both R’s are allowed in positions 3 and 4 (only the second R is in position 4, which is banned) – fails.

Try ""SPORT"":
- S – position 1 (allowed)
- P – new letter
- O – position 3 (banned) – fails.

Try ""STORE"":
- S – position 1 (allowed)
- T – new letter
- O – position 3 (banned) – fails.

Try ""SPORT"" variant: ""ROOST"":
- R – position 1 (allowed)
- O – position 2 (allowed)
- O – duplicate, but allowed
- S – position 4 (banned) – fails.

Try ""SPOOR"":
- S – position 1 (allowed)
- P – new letter
- O – position 3 (banned) – fails.

Try ""FRONT"":
- F – new letter
- R – position 2 (banned) – fails.

Try ""TRIOS"":
- T – new letter
- R – position 2 (banned) – fails.

Try ""ROIST"" again, but move S to position 5: ""ROIST"" → S is in 4, which is banned. So ""ROIST"" is invalid.

Let’s try ""SPOIL"":
- S – position 1 (allowed)
- P – new letter
- O – position 3 (banned) – fails.

Try ""SPOIL"" → ""SPOIL"" has O in 3, banned.

Try ""SPOIL"" → ""SPOIL"" is invalid.

Let’s systematically place R, O, S in allowed positions and fill the rest with new common letters.

Allowed positions:
R: 1,3,4,5 (not 2)
O: 1,2,4,5 (not 3)
S: 1,2,3,5 (not 4)

Let’s pick:
- S in position 1
- O in position 2
- R in position 3
- new letters for 4 and 5

Word: S O R _ _

Try ""SORBS"":
- S – position 1 (allowed)
- O – position 2 (allowed)
- R – position 3 (allowed)
- B – new letter
- S – duplicate S, but allowed (and S is allowed in position 5)

This seems valid. Let’s check:
- S is in positions 1 and 5 (both allowed)
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- R is in position 3 (allowed)
- B is new
- No A, E, or disallowed letters.

""SORBS"" is a valid English word meaning ""tensed or tensed-up letters"" (not a common word), but ""SORS"" plus a letter... Actually ""SORBS"" is valid.

But ""SORBS"" might be obscure. Let’s try ""SPORT"" again but with S in 1, O in 2, R in 3, T in 4, P in 5: ""SPORT"" has O in 2, R in 3, P in 5, T in 4 – but S is in 1, O in 2, R in 3, T in 4, P in 5. This gives S O R T P, which is ""SPORT"" – but we already saw O is in position 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed), T and P are new. This seems valid.

But ""SPORT"" has O in 2, R in 3, which are allowed. The feedback for ""SPORT"" would be:
- S – allowed in 1
- P – new
- O – allowed in 2
- R – allowed in 3
- T – new

This seems the best path. Let’s go with ""SPORT"".
</think>

Based on the feedback that R, O, and S are in the word but in wrong positions, I need to reposition them and introduce new letters. A good next guess is ""SPORT"":
- S is moved to position 1 (allowed)
- P is a new common letter
- O is moved to position 2 (allowed)
- R is moved to position 3 (allowed)
- T is a new common letter

This gives S O R T P, which is ""SPORT"" – but we already saw O is in position 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed), T and P are new.

The feedback for ""SPORT"" would be:\n- S – allowed in 1\n- P – new\n- O – allowed in 2\n- R – allowed in 3\n- T – new\n\nThis seems the best path. Let’s go with ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback that R, O, and S are in the word but in wrong positions, I need to reposition them and introduce new letters.

From the two clues:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)  
   – Letters in word: R, O, S (each appears once)

     R cannot be in position 2, O cannot be in position 3, S cannot be in position 4.

- O: positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (cannot be 3)  
- R: positions 1, 3, 5 (cannot be 2 or 4)

We still need two more distinct letters (not A, E, P). Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place S, O, R in allowed positions and fill the remaining two slots with new common letters. A promising pattern is to place S in position 2, O in position 1, and R in position 3, then pick two new consonants for positions 4 and 5.

All constraints satisfied. ""BORIS"" is a valid 5-letter word.Based on the combined feedback, I now know:
- The word contains exactly the letters R, O, S (no repeats).
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4, O cannot be in positions 3 or 4, R cannot be in positions 2 or 4.
- I still need two more distinct letters (not A, E, P).

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm several possibilities. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it contains frequently used letters (S, L, A, T, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which covers all five of the most common letters in English words. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 2).
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 4).
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: R, O, S
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, E
- R, O, S must appear somewhere other than positions 2, 3, 4 respectively.

A good next guess should:
1. Re-use R, O, S in new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters to narrow things down.
3. Avoid A, E, and the positions already ruled out for R, O, S.

Possible new positions:
- R cannot be in position 2, so try 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- O cannot be in position 3, so try 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- S cannot be in position 4, so try 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s try ""FIRST"":
- F – new letter, common
- I – new letter, common
- R – in position 3 (allowed, since R is only banned from position 2)
- S – in position 4 (not allowed, since S is banned from position 4)

That fails. Let’s try ""ROIST"":
- R – position 1 (allowed)
- O – position 2 (allowed)
- I – new letter
- S – position 4 (banned) – fails again.

Try ""SORRY"":
- S – position 1 (allowed)
- O – position 2 (allowed)
- R – position 3 (allowed)
- R – duplicate, but both R’s are allowed in positions 3 and 4 (only the second R is in position 4, which is banned) – fails.

Try ""SPORT"":
- S – position 1 (allowed)
- P – new letter
- O – position 3 (banned) – fails.

Try ""STORE"":
- S – position 1 (allowed)
- T – new letter
- O – position 3 (banned) – fails.

Try ""SPORT"" variant: ""ROOST"":
- R – position 1 (allowed)
- O – position 2 (allowed)
- O – duplicate, but allowed
- S – position 4 (banned) – fails.

Try ""SPOOR"":
- S – position 1 (allowed)
- P – new letter
- O – position 3 (banned) – fails.

Try ""FRONT"":
- F – new letter
- R – position 2 (banned) – fails.

Try ""TRIOS"":
- T – new letter
- R – position 2 (banned) – fails.

Try ""ROIST"" again, but move S to position 5: ""ROIST"" → S is in 4, which is banned. So ""ROIST"" is invalid.

Let’s try ""SPOIL"":
- S – position 1 (allowed)
- P – new letter
- O – position 3 (banned) – fails.

Try ""SPOIL"" → ""SPOIL"" has O in 3, banned.

Try ""SPOIL"" → ""SPOIL"" is invalid.

Let’s systematically place R, O, S in allowed positions and fill the rest with new common letters.

Allowed positions:
R: 1,3,4,5 (not 2)
O: 1,2,4,5 (not 3)
S: 1,2,3,5 (not 4)

Let’s pick:
- S in position 1
- O in position 2
- R in position 3
- new letters for 4 and 5

Word: S O R _ _

Try ""SORBS"":
- S – position 1 (allowed)
- O – position 2 (allowed)
- R – position 3 (allowed)
- B – new letter
- S – duplicate S, but allowed (and S is allowed in position 5)

This seems valid. Let’s check:
- S is in positions 1 and 5 (both allowed)
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- R is in position 3 (allowed)
- B is new
- No A, E, or disallowed letters.

""SORBS"" is a valid English word meaning ""tensed or tensed-up letters"" (not a common word), but ""SORS"" plus a letter... Actually ""SORBS"" is valid.

But ""SORBS"" might be obscure. Let’s try ""SPORT"" again but with S in 1, O in 2, R in 3, T in 4, P in 5: ""SPORT"" has O in 2, R in 3, P in 5, T in 4 – but S is in 1, O in 2, R in 3, T in 4, P in 5. This gives S O R T P, which is ""SPORT"" – but we already saw O is in position 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed), T and P are new. This seems valid.

But ""SPORT"" has O in 2, R in 3, which are allowed. The feedback for ""SPORT"" would be:
- S – allowed in 1
- P – new
- O – allowed in 2
- R – allowed in 3
- T – new

This seems the best path. Let’s go with ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback that R, O, and S are in the word but in wrong positions, I need to reposition them and introduce new letters. A good next guess is ""SPORT"":
- S is moved to position 1 (allowed)
- P is a new common letter
- O is moved to position 2 (allowed)
- R is moved to position 3 (allowed)
- T is a new common letter

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two clues:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)  
   – Letters in word: R, O, S (each appears once)  
   – Positions ruled out:  
     R cannot be in position 2, O cannot be in position 3, S cannot be in position 4.

2. SPORT → S(-) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(-)  
   – Letters in word: R, O, S (still the same three)  
   – Additional positions ruled out:  
     S cannot be in position 1, O cannot be in position 3, R cannot be in position 4.

Summary of allowed positions so far:
- S: positions 2, 3, 5 (cannot be 1 or 4)  
- O: positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (cannot be 3)  
- R: positions 1, 3, 5 (cannot be 2 or 4)

We still need two more distinct letters (not A, E, P). Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place S, O, R in allowed positions and fill the remaining two slots with new common letters. A promising pattern is to place S in position 2, O in position 1, and R in position 3, then pick two new consonants for positions 4 and 5.

Word formed: O S R _ _

Trying common consonants:
- O S R B L → “OSRBL” – not a word  
- O S R C H → “OSRCH” – not a word  
- O S R I N → “OSRIN” – not a word

I – new letter, allowed  
S – allowed (position 5)  

All constraints satisfied. ""BORIS"" is a valid 5-letter word.Based on the combined feedback, I now know:
- The word contains exactly the letters R, O, S (no repeats).
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4, O cannot be in positions 3 or 4, R cannot be in positions 2 or 4.
- I still need two more distinct letters (not A, E, P).

Trying to place R, O, S in all allowed positions while introducing two new common consonants, a valid word I can form is:

This gives S O R T P, which is ""SPORT"" – but we already saw O is in position 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed), T and P are new.

The feedback for ""SPORT"" would be:\n- S – allowed in 1\n- P – new\n- O – allowed in 2\n- R – allowed in 3\n- T – new\n\nThis seems the best path. Let’s go with ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback that R, O, and S are in the word but in wrong positions, I need to reposition them and introduce new letters.

- B(x) – B is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- R(✓) – R is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- I(x) – I is not in the word.
- S(✓) – S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So we now know:
- The word has the pattern: _ O R _ S
- Letters definitely in the word: O, R, S (and they are in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively).
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, B, E, I, P.

We still need to determine positions 1 and 4. The remaining unused common letters (excluding the excluded ones) include: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, Y.

Let's look for 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ O R _ S and use only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- C O R N S – valid word, uses C and N.
- F O R T S – valid word, uses F and T.
- G O R G S – invalid (double G, G already allowed but let's check others).
- H O R S E – invalid (E excluded).
- M O R S E – invalid (E excluded).
- T O R S E – invalid (E excluded).
- C O R P S – invalid (P excluded).
- F O R G S – invalid (G might be okay, but let's see if it's a word).
- D O R S E – invalid (E excluded).
- C O R N S – seems valid.

""CORNS"" fits perfectly:
- C is new, allowed.
- O is in position 2 (correct).
- R is in position 3 (correct).
- N is new, allowed.
- S is in position 5 (correct).

No conflicts with previous feedback.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm several possibilities. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it contains frequently used letters (S, L, A, T, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which covers all five of the most common letters in English words. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 2).
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 4).
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: R, O, S
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, E
- R, O, S must appear somewhere other than positions 2, 3, 4 respectively.

A good next guess should:
1. Re-use R, O, S in new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters to narrow things down.
3. Avoid A, E, and the positions already ruled out for R, O, S.

Possible new positions:
- R cannot be in position 2, so try 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- O cannot be in position 3, so try 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- S cannot be in position 4, so try 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s try ""FIRST"":
- F – new letter, common
- I – new letter, common
- R – in position 3 (allowed, since R is only banned from position 2)
- S – in position 4 (not allowed, since S is banned from position 4)

That fails. Let’s try ""ROIST"":
- R – position 1 (allowed)
- O – position 2 (allowed)
- I – new letter
- S – position 4 (banned) – fails again.

Try ""SORRY"":
- S – position 1 (allowed)
- O – position 2 (allowed)
- R – position 3 (allowed)
- R – duplicate, but both R’s are allowed in positions 3 and 4 (only the second R is in position 4, which is banned) – fails.

Try ""SPORT"":
- S – position 1 (allowed)
- P – new letter
- O – position 3 (banned) – fails.

Try ""STORE"":
- S – position 1 (allowed)
- T – new letter
- O – position 3 (banned) – fails.

Try ""SPORT"" variant: ""ROOST"":
- R – position 1 (allowed)
- O – position 2 (allowed)
- O – duplicate, but allowed
- S – position 4 (banned) – fails.

Try ""SPOOR"":
- S – position 1 (allowed)
- P – new letter
- O – position 3 (banned) – fails.

Try ""FRONT"":
- F – new letter
- R – position 2 (banned) – fails.

Try ""TRIOS"":
- T – new letter
- R – position 2 (banned) – fails.

Try ""ROIST"" again, but move S to position 5: ""ROIST"" → S is in 4, which is banned. So ""ROIST"" is invalid.

Let’s try ""SPOIL"":
- S – position 1 (allowed)
- P – new letter
- O – position 3 (banned) – fails.

Try ""SPOIL"" → ""SPOIL"" has O in 3, banned.

Try ""SPOIL"" → ""SPOIL"" is invalid.

Let’s systematically place R, O, S in allowed positions and fill the rest with new common letters.

Allowed positions:
R: 1,3,4,5 (not 2)
O: 1,2,4,5 (not 3)
S: 1,2,3,5 (not 4)

Let’s pick:
- S in position 1
- O in position 2
- R in position 3
- new letters for 4 and 5

Word: S O R _ _

Try ""SORBS"":
- S – position 1 (allowed)
- O – position 2 (allowed)
- R – position 3 (allowed)
- B – new letter
- S – duplicate S, but allowed (and S is allowed in position 5)

This seems valid. Let’s check:
- S is in positions 1 and 5 (both allowed)
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- R is in position 3 (allowed)
- B is new
- No A, E, or disallowed letters.

""SORBS"" is a valid English word meaning ""tensed or tensed-up letters"" (not a common word), but ""SORS"" plus a letter... Actually ""SORBS"" is valid.

But ""SORBS"" might be obscure. Let’s try ""SPORT"" again but with S in 1, O in 2, R in 3, T in 4, P in 5: ""SPORT"" has O in 2, R in 3, P in 5, T in 4 – but S is in 1, O in 2, R in 3, T in 4, P in 5. This gives S O R T P, which is ""SPORT"" – but we already saw O is in position 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed), T and P are new. This seems valid.

But ""SPORT"" has O in 2, R in 3, which are allowed. The feedback for ""SPORT"" would be:
- S – allowed in 1
- P – new
- O – allowed in 2
- R – allowed in 3
- T – new

This seems the best path. Let’s go with ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback that R, O, and S are in the word but in wrong positions, I need to reposition them and introduce new letters. A good next guess is ""SPORT"":
- S is moved to position 1 (allowed)
- P is a new common letter
- O is moved to position 2 (allowed)
- R is moved to position 3 (allowed)
- T is a new common letter

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two clues:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)  
   – Letters in word: R, O, S (each appears once)  
   – Positions ruled out:  
     R cannot be in position 2, O cannot be in position 3, S cannot be in position 4.

2. SPORT → S(-) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(-)  
   – Letters in word: R, O, S (still the same three)  
   – Additional positions ruled out:  
     S cannot be in position 1, O cannot be in position 3, R cannot be in position 4.

Summary of allowed positions so far:
- S: positions 2, 3, 5 (cannot be 1 or 4)  
- O: positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (cannot be 3)  
- R: positions 1, 3, 5 (cannot be 2 or 4)

We still need two more distinct letters (not A, E, P). Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place S, O, R in allowed positions and fill the remaining two slots with new common letters. A promising pattern is to place S in position 2, O in position 1, and R in position 3, then pick two new consonants for positions 4 and 5.

Word formed: O S R _ _

Trying common consonants:
- O S R B L → “OSRBL” – not a word  
- O S R C H → “OSRCH” – not a word  
- O S R I N → “OSRIN” – not a word  
- O S R U N → “OSRUN” – not a word

- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4, O cannot be in positions 3 or 4, R cannot be in positions 2 or 4.
- I still need two more distinct letters (not A, E, P).

From the new feedback on BORIS:
- B(x) – B is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- R(✓) – R is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- I(x) – I is not in the word.
- S(✓) – S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So we now know:
- The word has the pattern: _ O R _ S
- Letters definitely in the word: O, R, S (and they are in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively).
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, B, E, I, P.

We still need to determine positions 1 and 4. The remaining unused common letters (excluding the excluded ones) include: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, Y.

Let's look for 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ O R _ S and use only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- C O R N S – valid word, uses C and N.
- F O R T S – valid word, uses F and T.
- G O R G S – invalid (double G, G already allowed but let's check others).
- H O R S E – invalid (E excluded).
- M O R S E – invalid (E excluded).
- T O R S E – invalid (E excluded).
- C O R P S – invalid (P excluded).
- F O R G S – invalid (G might be okay, but let's see if it's a word).
- D O R S E – invalid (E excluded).
- C O R N S – seems valid.

""CORNS"" fits perfectly:
- C is new, allowed.
- O is in position 2 (correct).
- R is in position 3 (correct).
- N is new, allowed.
- S is in position 5 (correct).

No conflicts with previous feedback.

This gives S O R T P, which is ""SPORT"" – but we already saw O is in position 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed), T and P are new. This seems valid.\n\nBut ""SPORT"" has O in 2, R in 3, which are allowed. The feedback for ""SPORT"" would be:\n- S – allowed in 1\n- P – new\n- O – allowed in 2\n- R – allowed in 3\n- T – new\n\nThis seems the best path. Let’s go with ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback that R, O, and S are in the word but in wrong positions, I need to reposition them and introduce new letters. A good next guess is ""SPORT"":\n- S is moved to position 1 (allowed)\n- P is a new common letter\n- O is moved to position 2 (allowed)\n- R is moved to position 3 (allowed)\n- T is a new common letter\n\n<guess>SPORT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two clues:\n\n1.

2. Letters already ruled OUT:  
   A, B, C, E, I, N, P

3. Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 4:  
   D, F, G, H, K, L, M, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that matches the pattern and uses only allowed letters.

Scanning common words of this pattern:

- D O R S S  – invalid (double S, and S already fixed at position 5)  
- F O R T S  – valid word, uses F and T (both still allowed)  
- G O R G S  – invalid (double G, and S already fixed)  
- H O R S E  – invalid (E ruled out)  
- M O R T S  – valid word, uses M and T  
- T O R T S  – invalid (double T)  
- W O R L S  – invalid (L allowed, but “WORL S” isn’t a word)  
- G O R L S  – invalid (G allowed, but not a common word)  
- F O R G S  – invalid (not a recognized word)  
- M O R G S  – invalid (not a recognized word)  

The two clear valid candidates are “FORTS” and “MORTS”.  
Both fit the pattern and use only allowed letters.

“FORTS” is more common, so I’ll go with it first.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm several possibilities. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it contains frequently used letters (S, L, A, T, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which covers all five of the most common letters in English words. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 2).
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 4).
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: R, O, S
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, E
- R, O, S must appear somewhere other than positions 2, 3, 4 respectively.

A good next guess should:
1. Re-use R, O, S in new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters to narrow things down.
3. Avoid A, E, and the positions already ruled out for R, O, S.

Possible new positions:
- R cannot be in position 2, so try 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- O cannot be in position 3, so try 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- S cannot be in position 4, so try 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s try ""FIRST"":
- F – new letter, common
- I – new letter, common
- R – in position 3 (allowed, since R is only banned from position 2)
- S – in position 4 (not allowed, since S is banned from position 4)

That fails. Let’s try ""ROIST"":
- R – position 1 (allowed)
- O – position 2 (allowed)
- I – new letter
- S – position 4 (banned) – fails again.

Try ""SORRY"":
- S – position 1 (allowed)
- O – position 2 (allowed)
- R – position 3 (allowed)
- R – duplicate, but both R’s are allowed in positions 3 and 4 (only the second R is in position 4, which is banned) – fails.

Try ""SPORT"":
- S – position 1 (allowed)
- P – new letter
- O – position 3 (banned) – fails.

Try ""STORE"":
- S – position 1 (allowed)
- T – new letter
- O – position 3 (banned) – fails.

Try ""SPORT"" variant: ""ROOST"":
- R – position 1 (allowed)
- O – position 2 (allowed)
- O – duplicate, but allowed
- S – position 4 (banned) – fails.

Try ""SPOOR"":
- S – position 1 (allowed)
- P – new letter
- O – position 3 (banned) – fails.

Try ""FRONT"":
- F – new letter
- R – position 2 (banned) – fails.

Try ""TRIOS"":
- T – new letter
- R – position 2 (banned) – fails.

Try ""ROIST"" again, but move S to position 5: ""ROIST"" → S is in 4, which is banned. So ""ROIST"" is invalid.

Let’s try ""SPOIL"":
- S – position 1 (allowed)
- P – new letter
- O – position 3 (banned) – fails.

Try ""SPOIL"" → ""SPOIL"" has O in 3, banned.

Try ""SPOIL"" → ""SPOIL"" is invalid.

Let’s systematically place R, O, S in allowed positions and fill the rest with new common letters.

Allowed positions:
R: 1,3,4,5 (not 2)
O: 1,2,4,5 (not 3)
S: 1,2,3,5 (not 4)

Let’s pick:
- S in position 1
- O in position 2
- R in position 3
- new letters for 4 and 5

Word: S O R _ _

Try ""SORBS"":
- S – position 1 (allowed)
- O – position 2 (allowed)
- R – position 3 (allowed)
- B – new letter
- S – duplicate S, but allowed (and S is allowed in position 5)

This seems valid. Let’s check:
- S is in positions 1 and 5 (both allowed)
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- R is in position 3 (allowed)
- B is new
- No A, E, or disallowed letters.

""SORBS"" is a valid English word meaning ""tensed or tensed-up letters"" (not a common word), but ""SORS"" plus a letter... Actually ""SORBS"" is valid.

But ""SORBS"" might be obscure. Let’s try ""SPORT"" again but with S in 1, O in 2, R in 3, T in 4, P in 5: ""SPORT"" has O in 2, R in 3, P in 5, T in 4 – but S is in 1, O in 2, R in 3, T in 4, P in 5. This gives S O R T P, which is ""SPORT"" – but we already saw O is in position 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed), T and P are new. This seems valid.

But ""SPORT"" has O in 2, R in 3, which are allowed. The feedback for ""SPORT"" would be:
- S – allowed in 1
- P – new
- O – allowed in 2
- R – allowed in 3
- T – new

This seems the best path. Let’s go with ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback that R, O, and S are in the word but in wrong positions, I need to reposition them and introduce new letters. A good next guess is ""SPORT"":
- S is moved to position 1 (allowed)
- P is a new common letter
- O is moved to position 2 (allowed)
- R is moved to position 3 (allowed)
- T is a new common letter

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two clues:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)  
   – Letters in word: R, O, S (each appears once)  
   – Positions ruled out:  
     R cannot be in position 2, O cannot be in position 3, S cannot be in position 4.

2. SPORT → S(-) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(-)  
   – Letters in word: R, O, S (still the same three)  
   – Additional positions ruled out:  
     S cannot be in position 1, O cannot be in position 3, R cannot be in position 4.

Summary of allowed positions so far:
- S: positions 2, 3, 5 (cannot be 1 or 4)  
- O: positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (cannot be 3)  
- R: positions 1, 3, 5 (cannot be 2 or 4)

We still need two more distinct letters (not A, E, P). Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place S, O, R in allowed positions and fill the remaining two slots with new common letters. A promising pattern is to place S in position 2, O in position 1, and R in position 3, then pick two new consonants for positions 4 and 5.

Word formed: O S R _ _

Trying common consonants:
- O S R B L → “OSRBL” – not a word  
- O S R C H → “OSRCH” – not a word  
- O S R I N → “OSRIN” – not a word  
- O S R U N → “OSRUN” – not a word

R – allowed (position 3)

All constraints satisfied. ""BORIS"" is a valid 5-letter word.Based on the combined feedback, I now know:
- The word contains exactly the letters R, O, S (no repeats).
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4, O cannot be in positions 3 or 4, R cannot be in positions 2 or 4.
- I still need two more distinct letters (not A, E, P).

Trying to place R, O, S in all allowed positions while introducing two new common consonants, a valid word I can form is:

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: BORIS -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(✓)

From the new feedback on BORIS:
- B(x) – B is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- R(✓) – R is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- I(x) – I is not in the word.
- S(✓) – S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So we now know:
- The word has the pattern: _ O R _ S
- Letters definitely in the word: O, R, S (and they are in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively).
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, B, E, I, P.

We still need to determine positions 1 and 4. The remaining unused common letters (excluding the excluded ones) include: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, Y.

Let's look for 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ O R _ S and use only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- C O R N S – valid word, uses C and N.
- F O R T S – valid word, uses F and T.
- G O R G S – invalid (double G, G already allowed but let's check others).
- H O R S E – invalid (E excluded).
- M O R S E – invalid (E excluded).
- T O R S E – invalid (E excluded).
- C O R P S – invalid (P excluded).
- F O R G S – invalid (G might be okay, but let's see if it's a word).
- D O R S E – invalid (E excluded).
- C O R N S – seems valid.

""CORNS"" fits perfectly:
- C is new, allowed.
- O is in position 2 (correct).
- R is in position 3 (correct).
- N is new, allowed.
- S is in position 5 (correct).

No conflicts with previous feedback.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPORT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) O(-) R(-) T(-)

We now know:

1. Fixed letters:  
   _ O R _ S  (O in 2, R in 3, S in 5)

2. Letters already ruled OUT:  
   A, B, C, E, I, N, P

3. Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 4:  
   D, F, G, H, K, L, M, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that matches the pattern and uses only allowed letters.

Scanning common words of this pattern:

- D O R S S  – invalid (double S, and S already fixed at position 5)  
- F O R T S  – valid word, uses F and T (both still allowed)  
- G O R G S  – invalid (double G, and S already fixed)  
- H O R S E  – invalid (E ruled out)  
- M O R T S  – valid word, uses M and T  
- T O R T S  – invalid (double T)  
- W O R L S  – invalid (L allowed, but “WORL S” isn’t a word)  
- G O R L S  – invalid (G allowed, but not a common word)  
- F O R G S  – invalid (not a recognized word)  
- M O R G S  – invalid (not a recognized word)  

The two clear valid candidates are “FORTS” and “MORTS”.  
Both fit the pattern and use only allowed letters.

“FORTS” is more common, so I’ll go with it first.

This gives S O R T P, which is ""SPORT"" – but we already saw O is in position 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed), T and P are new. This seems valid.\n\nBut ""SPORT"" has O in 2, R in 3, which are allowed. The feedback for ""SPORT"" would be:\n- S – allowed in 1\n- P – new\n- O – allowed in 2\n- R – allowed in 3\n- T – new\n\nThis seems the best path.

We now know:

- Fixed letters: _ O R _ S  (O in 2, R in 3, S in 5)
- Letters ruled OUT: A, B, C, E, F, I, N, P
- Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 4: D, G, H, K, L, M, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

From Guess 5 (FORTS), we learned:
- T is in the word but NOT in position 4 (T(-)).

So T must be in position 1.

Thus the pattern becomes: T O R _ S

We need a letter for position 4, chosen from the still-allowed set, such that the resulting word is valid.

Possible letters for position 4: D, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y

Looking for real words that fit T O R _ S:

- TORDS – not a valid word
- TORGS – not valid
- TORHS – not valid
- TORKS – not valid
- TORLD – not valid
- TORMS – not valid
- TORSK – not valid
- TORUS – valid word
- TORVS – not valid
- TORWS – not valid
- TORYS – not valid

The only valid word in the pattern T O R _ S is “TORUS”.

Check letters:
- T – allowed and must be in position 1 (from FORTS feedback)
- O – fixed in position 2
- R – fixed in position 3
- U – allowed (not yet ruled out)
- S – fixed in position 5

No conflicts with previous feedback.
