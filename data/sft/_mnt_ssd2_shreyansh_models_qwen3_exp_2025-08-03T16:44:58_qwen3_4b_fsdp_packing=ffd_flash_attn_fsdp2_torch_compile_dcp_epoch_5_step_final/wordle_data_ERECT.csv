For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically contain a mix of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""SOARE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word. This is a strategic first guess to maximize the information gained from the feedback.

- R: confirmed in position 2
- E: will test in position 3

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically contain a mix of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""SOARE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word. This is a strategic first guess to maximize the information gained from the feedback.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter).
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So far we know:
- The word is of the form _ R _ _ _
- Contains the letter E somewhere (but not at position 5)
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S

I need a word that:
1. Has R in the 2nd position
2. Has E somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 4)
3. Avoids A, O, S
4. Uses common remaining consonants to maximize info

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.

I'll try ""TREND"":
- T: common, hasn't been ruled out
- R: confirmed in position 2
- E: will test in position 3
- N: common, hasn't been ruled out
- D: common, hasn't been ruled out

This should help determine the correct placement of E and test new consonants.

Current knowledge:
- Word pattern: _ R E _ _
- Letters confirmed present: R (position 2), E (somewhere, but not position 3), T (in word but wrong position), D (not in word), N (not in word), A, O, S (all absent)
- E cannot be in position 3 (from TREND feedback), so E must be in position 1, 4, or 5
- T is in the word but not in position 1, so T must be in position 4 or 5
- Remaining unused common letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

Possible positions:
- If E is in position 1: E R _ _ _
- If E is in position 4: _ R E T _
- If E is in position 5: _ R E _ T

Let's try a word that:
1. Places E in position 1 (most restrictive)
2. Tests common consonants not yet used
3. Keeps T in position 4 or 5

A good candidate is ""EVERY"":
- E in position 1
- V (new, common) in position 3
- R in position 2
- Y (new, common) in position 5
- Every already contains T? No, T is not in EVER. Need to include T.

Try ""TREND"" again? No, N and D are out. Need a word with T in position 4 or 5 and E somewhere.

""CRUEL"":
- C, R, U, E, L
- R in position 2
- E in position 4
- T not present - bad

""PERIT"":
- P, E, R, I, T
- R in position 3 - wrong

""ETHER"":
- E, T, H, E, R
- R in position 5 - wrong

""ENTRY"":
- E, N, T, R, Y - N is out

""VERIT"":
- V, E, R, I, T
- R in position 3 - wrong

""EXTRA"":
- A is out

""FRUIT"":
- F, R, U, I, T
- R in position 2
- T in position 5
- E must be present - not here

""PREST"":
- S is out

""CRETE"":
- C, R, E, T, E
- R in position 2
- E in position 3 - but from TREND, E is not in position 3 - invalid

""INTER"":
- N is out

""METRE"":
- M, E, T, R, E
- R in position 4 - wrong

""UREIC"":
- U, R, E, I, C
- R in position 2
- E in position 3 - invalid

""PERCH"":
- P, E, R, C, H
- R in position 3 - wrong

""VERGE"":
- V, E, R, G, E
- R in position 3 - wrong

""GREED"":
- D is out

""WHITE"":
- W, H, I, T, E
- R is missing - wrong

""CRIME"":
- C, R, I, M, E
- R in position 2
- E in position 5
- T is in word but not in position 1 - here T is not present - so T must be in 4 or 5 - here it's missing - so this is bad

""TRIPE"":
- T, R, I, P, E
- R in position 2
- E in position 5
- T in position 1 - but from TREND, T is in word but not in position 1 - so this is invalid

""EXTRA"" - a is out

""ENTER"" - n is out

""EVERY"" - no T

""VIRTE"" - not a word

""PIRET"" - not a word

""FRUIT"" - no E

""CRUEL"" - no T

""METRE"" - T in position 1 - invalid

""UTILE"" - no T

""PREST"" - S out

""CREST"" - S out

""DIRECT"" - too long

""BRUIT"" - B, R, U, I, T
- R in position 2
- T in position 5
- E must be present - not here

""CRUET"" - C, R, U, E, T
- R in position 2
- E in position 4
- T in position 5
- This satisfies:
  - R in position 2
  - E in position 4 (valid, since E is not in position 3)
  - T in position 5 (valid, since T is in word but not in position 1)
  - No forbidden letters (A, O, S, N, D)

""Cruet"" is a valid word (though rare), but ""CRUET"" is acceptable.

Another option is ""CRIER"" - but T is missing.

""VERIT"" - not a word.

""URINE"" - N out.

""PIRET"" - not a word.

""FRUIT"" - no E.

""CRUEL"" - no T.

""UTILE"" - no T.

""PIECE"" - no T.

""CREPE"" - no T.

""GREPE"" - no T.

""WHITE"" - no T.

""BRUIT"" - B, R, U, I, T
- R in position 2
- T in position 5
- E must be present - not here

""CRUET"" seems to be the only valid word fitting all constraints.

But let's double-check:
- A, O, S: absent - OK
- R in position 2: OK
- E in position 4: OK (not position 3)
- T in position 5: OK (not position 1)
- Letters used: C, R, U, E, T - all allowed

Thus, the best next guess is ""CRUET"".

From the feedback on AROSE:

- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So far we know:

- Contains the letter E somewhere (but not at position 5)
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S

I need a word that:
1. Has R in the 2nd position
2. Has E somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 4)
3. Avoids A, O, S
4. Uses common remaining consonants to maximize info

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.

I'll try ""TREND"":
- T: common, hasn't been ruled out
- R: confirmed in position 2
- E: will test in position 3
- N: common, hasn't been ruled out
- D: common, hasn't been ruled out

This should help determine the correct placement of E and test new consonants.

- Y (new, common) in position 5
- Every already contains T? No, T is not in EVER. Need to include T.

Try ""TREND"" again? No, N and D are out. Need a word with T in position 4 or 5 and E somewhere.

""CRUEL"":
- C, R, U, E, L
- R in position 2

- T not present - bad

""PERIT"":

- R in position 3 - wrong

""ETHER"":

""CRETE"":
- C, R, E, T, E
- R in position 2
- E in position 3 - but from TREND, E is not in position 3 - invalid

""INTER"":
- N is out

""METRE"":
- M, E, T, R, E
- R in position 4 - wrong

""UREIC"":
- U, R, E, I, C
- R in position 2

""VERGE"":
- V, E, R, G, E
- R in position 3 - wrong

""GREED"":

""WHITE"":
- W, H, I, T, E
- R is missing - wrong

""CRIME"":
- C, R, I, M, E
- R in position 2
- E in position 5
- T is in word but not in position 1 - here T is not present - so T must be in 4 or 5 - here it's missing - so this is bad

""TRIPE"":
- T, R, I, P, E
- R in position 2
- E in position 5
- T in position 1 - but from TREND, T is in word but not in position 1 - so this is invalid

""EXTRA"" - a is out

""ENTER"" - n is out

""EVERY"" - no T

""VIRTE"" - not a word

""PIRET"" - not a word

""FRUIT"" - no E

""CRUEL"" - no T

""METRE"" - T in position 1 - invalid

""UTILE"" - no T

""PREST"" - S out

""CREST"" - S out

""DIRECT"" - too long

""BRUIT"" - B, R, U, I, T
- R in position 2
- T in position 5
- E must be present - not here

""CRUET"" - C, R, U, E, T
- R in position 2
- E in position 4
- T in position 5
- This satisfies:
  - R in position 2
  - E in position 4 (valid, since E is not in position 3)
  - T in position 5 (valid, since T is in word but not in position 1)
  - No forbidden letters (A, O, S, N, D)

""Cruet"" is a valid word (though rare), but ""CRUET"" is acceptable.

Another option is ""CRIER"" - but T is missing.

""VERIT"" - not a word.

""URINE"" - N out.

""PIRET"" - not a word.

""FRUIT"" - no E.

""CRUEL"" - no T.

""UTILE"" - no T.

""PIECE"" - no T.

""CREPE"" - no T.

""GREPE"" - no T.

""WHITE"" - no T.

""BRUIT"" - B, R, U, I, T
- R in position 2
- T in position 5
- E must be present - not here

""CRUET"" seems to be the only valid word fitting all constraints.

But let's double-check:
- A, O, S: absent - OK
- R in position 2: OK
- E in position 4: OK (not position 3)
- T in position 5: OK (not position 1)
- Letters used: C, R, U, E, T - all allowed

Thus, the best next guess is ""CRUET"".

Current knowledge after all feedback:

1. Pattern: _ R E _ T  (R in pos 2, E in pos 3, T in pos 5 are confirmed)
   - But wait: from CRUET feedback, E is in word but wrong position (E(-) in pos 4), so E cannot be in pos 3 or 4.  
   - From TREND feedback, E is in word but wrong position (E(-) in pos 3), so E cannot be in pos 3.  
   - From CRUET feedback, E is in word but wrong position (E(-) in pos 4), so E cannot be in pos 4.  
   - Thus E must be in pos 1 or 2, but pos 2 is R.  
   - Conclusion: E must be in pos 1.

So the pattern is now: E R _ _ T

2. Letters known to be in the word: R (pos 2), E (pos 1), T (pos 5)

3. Letters known NOT in the word: A, O, S, N, D, U, C (from all feedback)

4. Remaining unused common consonants: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y

5. The word is E R _ _ T, so we need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters not yet excluded.

Possible letters for positions 3 and 4 (from remaining unused): B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y

Looking for common 5-letter words matching E R _ _ T:

- ERGOT
- ERGOT (G and O - O is excluded)
- ERBET - not a word
- ERHOT - not a word
- ERKET - not a word
- ERLYT - not a word
- ERMIT - M and I (I not yet used)
- ERWIT - not a word
- ERYTH - not a word
- ERVET - not a word
- ERPET - not a word
- ERFIT - not a word
- ERGFT - not a word

Checking ERMIT:
- E R M I T
- Letters: E, R, M, I, T
- I is not yet excluded (only consonants tested so far)
- No forbidden letters
- Valid word

This seems to fit all constraints:
- E in pos 1 (correct)
- R in pos 2 (correct)
- M and I not yet excluded
- T in pos 5 (correct)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically contain a mix of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""SOARE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word. This is a strategic first guess to maximize the information gained from the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter).
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So far we know:
- The word is of the form _ R _ _ _
- Contains the letter E somewhere (but not at position 5)
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S

I need a word that:
1. Has R in the 2nd position
2. Has E somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 4)
3. Avoids A, O, S
4. Uses common remaining consonants to maximize info

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.

I'll try ""TREND"":
- T: common, hasn't been ruled out
- R: confirmed in position 2
- E: will test in position 3
- N: common, hasn't been ruled out
- D: common, hasn't been ruled out

This should help determine the correct placement of E and test new consonants.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: TREND -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(✓) E(✓) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current knowledge:
- Word pattern: _ R E _ _
- Letters confirmed present: R (position 2), E (somewhere, but not position 3), T (in word but wrong position), D (not in word), N (not in word), A, O, S (all absent)
- E cannot be in position 3 (from TREND feedback), so E must be in position 1, 4, or 5
- T is in the word but not in position 1, so T must be in position 4 or 5
- Remaining unused common letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

Possible positions:
- If E is in position 1: E R _ _ _
- If E is in position 4: _ R E T _
- If E is in position 5: _ R E _ T

Let's try a word that:
1. Places E in position 1 (most restrictive)
2. Tests common consonants not yet used
3. Keeps T in position 4 or 5

A good candidate is ""EVERY"":
- E in position 1
- V (new, common) in position 3
- R in position 2
- Y (new, common) in position 5
- Every already contains T? No, T is not in EVER. Need to include T.

Try ""TREND"" again? No, N and D are out. Need a word with T in position 4 or 5 and E somewhere.

""CRUEL"":
- C, R, U, E, L
- R in position 2
- E in position 4
- T not present - bad

""PERIT"":
- P, E, R, I, T
- R in position 3 - wrong

""ETHER"":
- E, T, H, E, R
- R in position 5 - wrong

""ENTRY"":
- E, N, T, R, Y - N is out

""VERIT"":
- V, E, R, I, T
- R in position 3 - wrong

""EXTRA"":
- A is out

""FRUIT"":
- F, R, U, I, T
- R in position 2
- T in position 5
- E must be present - not here

""PREST"":

""CRETE"":
- C, R, E, T, E
- R in position 2
- E in position 3 - but from TREND, E is not in position 3 - invalid

""INTER"":
- N is out

""METRE"":
- M, E, T, R, E
- R in position 4 - wrong

""UREIC"":
- U, R, E, I, C
- R in position 2
- E in position 3 - invalid

""PERCH"":
- P, E, R, C, H
- R in position 3 - wrong

""VERGE"":
- V, E, R, G, E
- R in position 3 - wrong

""GREED"":
- D is out

""WHITE"":
- W, H, I, T, E
- R is missing - wrong

""CRIME"":
- C, R, I, M, E
- R in position 2
- E in position 5
- T is in word but not in position 1 - here T is not present - so T must be in 4 or 5 - here it's missing - so this is bad

""TRIPE"":
- T, R, I, P, E
- R in position 2
- E in position 5
- T in position 1 - but from TREND, T is in word but not in position 1 - so this is invalid

""EXTRA"" - a is out

""VIRTE"" - not a word

""PIRET"" - not a word

""FRUIT"" - no E

""CRUEL"" - no T

""METRE"" - T in position 1 - invalid

""UTILE"" - no T

""PREST"" - S out

""CREST"" - S out

""DIRECT"" - too long

""BRUIT"" - B, R, U, I, T
- R in position 2
- T in position 5
- E must be present - not here

""CRUET"" - C, R, U, E, T
- R in position 2
- E in position 4
- T in position 5
- This satisfies:
  - R in position 2
  - E in position 4 (valid, since E is not in position 3)
  - T in position 5 (valid, since T is in word but not in position 1)
  - No forbidden letters (A, O, S, N, D)

""Cruet"" is a valid word (though rare), but ""CRUET"" is acceptable.

Another option is ""CRIER"" - but T is missing.

""VERIT"" - not a word.

""URINE"" - N out.

""PIRET"" - not a word.

""FRUIT"" - no E.

""CRUEL"" - no T.

""UTILE"" - no T.

""PIECE"" - no T.

""CREPE"" - no T.

""GREPE"" - no T.

""WHITE"" - no T.

""BRUIT"" - B, R, U, I, T
- R in position 2
- T in position 5
- E must be present - not here

""CRUET"" seems to be the only valid word fitting all constraints.

But let's double-check:
- A, O, S: absent - OK
- R in position 2: OK
- E in position 4: OK (not position 3)
- T in position 5: OK (not position 1)
- Letters used: C, R, U, E, T - all allowed

Thus, the best next guess is ""CRUET"".

Current knowledge after all feedback:

1. Pattern: _ R E _ T  (R in pos 2, E in pos 3, T in pos 5 are confirmed)
   - But wait: from CRUET feedback, E is in word but wrong position (E(-) in pos 4), so E cannot be in pos 3 or 4.  
   - From TREND feedback, E is in word but wrong position (E(-) in pos 3), so E cannot be in pos 3.  
   - From CRUET feedback, E is in word but wrong position (E(-) in pos 4), so E cannot be in pos 4.  
   - Thus E must be in pos 1 or 2, but pos 2 is R.  
   - Conclusion: E must be in pos 1.

So the pattern is now: E R _ _ T

2. Letters known to be in the word: R (pos 2), E (pos 1), T (pos 5)

3. Letters known NOT in the word: A, O, S, N, D, U, C (from all feedback)

4. Remaining unused common consonants: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y

5. The word is E R _ _ T, so we need to fill positions 3 and 4 with letters not yet excluded.

Possible letters for positions 3 and 4 (from remaining unused): B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y

Checking ERMIT:
- E R M I T
- Letters: E, R, M, I, T
- I is not yet excluded (only consonants tested so far)
- No forbidden letters
- Valid word

This seems to fit all constraints:
- E in pos 1 (correct)
- R in pos 2 (correct)
- M and I not yet excluded
- T in pos 5 (correct)

   ""ERFET"" → This is actually a word (British slang).

Let's verify:
- E R F E T
- Letters: E, R, F, E, T
- All letters are allowed (not in the excluded list)
- It matches the pattern E R _ _ T

Thus, the correct next guess is ""ERFET"".

From the latest feedback on ERFET:

1. Positions already fixed:
   - E R _ _ T  (positions 1, 2, 5 are confirmed)
   - The 4th letter is T (because E is in position 4 and marked ✓)
     - But wait: the feedback shows E(✓) R(✓) F(x) E(-) T(✓)
     - This means:
       - position 1: E ✓
       - position 2: R ✓
       - position 3: F x  (F not in word)
       - position 4: E -  (E is in word but not here)
       - position 5: T ✓

   - Contradiction: T is confirmed in position 5, but E is also confirmed in position 4 (but marked as wrong position).  
   - However, the feedback symbol ""-"" means ""letter is in the word but in the wrong position"".  
   - So E is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   - Therefore, the only possible positions for E are 1, 3, or 5.  
   - But position 1 is already E ✓, and position 5 is T ✓, so E must be in position 3.

   - Thus the pattern is: E R E _ T

2. Letters known NOT in the word (from all feedback):
   A, O, S, N, D, U, C, M, I, F

3. Remaining unused common consonants (for position 4):
   B, G, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y

4. Need to find a valid English word matching E R E _ T.

   Possible letters for position 4:
   - B → ER E B T → ""EREBT"" – not a word
   - G → ER E G T → ""EREGT"" – not a word
   - H → ER E H T → ""EREHT"" – not a word
   - K → ER E K T → ""ERekt"" – not a word
   - L → ER E L T → ""ERELT"" – not a word
   - P → ER E P T → ""EREPT"" – not a word
   - V → ER E V T → ""EREVT"" – not a word
   - W → ER E W T → ""EREWT"" – not a word
   - Y → ER E Y T → ""EREYT"" – not a word

   Realizing that none of these combinations form valid English words.  
   This suggests an error in deduction.

   Re-evaluating the feedback:
   - ERFET → E(✓) R(✓) F(x) E(-) T(✓)
   - The symbols indicate:
     - position 1: E is correct (✓)
     - position 2: R is correct (✓)
     - position 3: F is not in the word (x)
     - position 4: E is in the word but not here (-)
     - position 5: T is correct (✓)

   - Therefore, the word has:
     - E in position 1
     - R in position 2
     - T in position 5
     - E somewhere else (but not position 4)
     - No F

   - The only remaining positions for the second E are positions 3 or 4, but:
     - position 4 cannot have E (feedback says E is not here)
     - position 3 is still open.

   - Thus the pattern is: E R _ _ T with an additional E somewhere, but not at position 4.  
   - The only possible placement is: E R E _ T (with the third letter being any allowed consonant).

   - Checking again for valid words:
     - E R E B T – not a word
     - E R E G T – not a word
     - E R E K T – not a word
     - E R E L T – not a word
     - E R E M T – M is excluded

     - E R E D T – D is excluded
     - E R E C T – C is excluded
     - E R E H T – not a word
     - E R E W T – not a word
     - E R E Y T – not a word

   - Realizing that ""ERECT"" is a valid word but C is excluded.
   - ""ERGOT"" has O and G, but O is excluded.
   - ""ERBET"" is not a word.
   - ""ERGET"" is not a word.
   - ""ERPET"" is not a word.
   - ""ERVET"" is not a word.
   - ""ERWET"" is not a word.
   - ""ERYET"" is not a word.

   - This implies that the word must be ""ERGET"" but G and T are in positions 3 and 5, but T is fixed at position 5.
   - This is confusing. Let's re-express:

   The word has:
   - E R _ _ T
   - Contains an additional E (since E is in word twice: one in position 1 and one elsewhere)
   - The second E cannot be in position 4, so it must be in position 3.
   - Therefore the word must be: E R E _ T
   - The blank must be a consonant not yet used (from remaining: B, G, H, K, L, P, V, W, Y)

   - Checking valid words:
     - E R E B T – ""EREBT"" – not a word
     - E R E G T – ""EREGT"" – not a word
     - E R E K T – ""ERekt"" – not a word
     - E R E L T – ""ERELT"" – not a word
     - E R E P T – ""EREPT"" – not a word
     - E R E V T – ""EREVT"" – not a word
     - E R E W T – ""EREWT"" – not a word
     - E R E Y T – ""EREYT"" – not a word

   - This suggests that the word is ""ERGET"" but this would require G in position 3 and T in position 5, which matches the feedback:
     - E R G E T
     - positions: 1=E ✓, 2=R ✓, 3=G (not excluded yet), 4=E (-), 5=T ✓
     - G has not been excluded (only F, M, I, C, N, D, A, O, S are excluded)
     - This forms the valid word ""ERGET"".

   - Therefore, the correct next guess is ""ERGET"".
