For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to determine which letters might be in the secret word and their positions.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because:
1. It has common letters (S, L, A, T, E)
2. The vowels A and E are very common
3. The consonants S, L, T are common
4. It covers different letter positions effectively

After considering various options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it hits many common letters and vowels.

Current constraints after three guesses:

2. Letters known to be in the word but position unknown: G (-), D (✓), Y (✓).
3. Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, S, E, M, U, T, H, L.

So the pattern is:
- Position 1: not A, R, S, E, M, U, T, H, L. Remaining common letters: B, C, F, G, I, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
- Position 2: O (fixed).
- Position 3: D (✓), so D must be here.
- Position 4: must be one of the remaining letters after placing G and Y.
- Position 5: must be Y (✓).

We also know G is in the word but not in position 1 (from GODLY feedback: G(-)), so G must be in position 4.

Thus the word must be: _ O D G Y.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits _ O D G Y. The only common English word that fits is ""BODGY"" (though ""BODGY"" is informal), but ""BOGGY"" is invalid (double G). The correct and common word is ""BODGE"" but E is eliminated.

Wait, checking valid 5-letter words: ""BOGGY"" is invalid (two G's), ""BODGY"" is valid but less common. Actually, the correct and common word is ""BODGE"" but E is eliminated.

Looking again: ""C"" is still available. ""C"" can be in position 1. The word would be ""C O D G Y"" which is ""CODGY"" - but this is not a common word.

The only valid common word fitting _ O D G Y is ""BODGY"" but B is still available.

But let's think differently: the word must be _ O D G Y. The only valid English word here is ""BODGY"" (as in ""bodgy"" adjective meaning clumsy), but it's not very common.

Actually, the correct and common word is ""BODGE"" but E is eliminated.

Wait, perhaps I missed another possibility. Let me re-examine:

We have:
- Positions: _ O D _ Y
- G must be in position 4 (since it's in the word but not in position 1 or 4? No, from GODLY feedback G is in the word but not in position 1 (G(-)), and from previous guesses it's not in position 4 (from GODLY feedback: G(-) means not in position 1, and D is in position 3, Y in 5, so G must be in position 4).

Thus the word must be: _ O D G Y.

""NODGY"" is a valid word (rare), but more common is ""NODGE"" but E is eliminated.

Actually, the most likely valid word is ""BODGY"" but let's check if there's a better fit.

Upon reflection, the correct and common word fitting _ O D G Y is ""BODGY"".

But let's verify:

However, ""BODGY"" is quite rare. Let me check if there's another word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to determine which letters might be in the secret word and their positions.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because:

2. The vowels A and E are very common
3. The consonants S, L, T are common
4. It covers different letter positions effectively

After considering various options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it hits many common letters and vowels.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 3).
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- O is somewhere in the word, but not in position 3.
- No A, R, S, or E appear in the word at all.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains an O (but not in position 3).
2. Contains none of A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc.
Good vowels: we already know O is present; we could try I or U if needed.

A good candidate is “COUNT”:
- C, O, U, N, T.
- O is in position 2 (not 3, so satisfies the feedback).
- No A, R, S, or E.
- Uses common letters C, U, N, T.

Another candidate is “MOUTH”:
- M, O, U, T, H.
- O in position 2 again.

I’ll choose “MOUTH” because it uses very common letters and gives good coverage.

<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. MOUTH → M(x) O(✓) U(x) T(x) H(x)  
   ⇒ O is in position 2 and is correct there.  
   ⇒ M, U, T, H are not in the word.  
   ⇒ A, R, S, E were already ruled out in the first guess.

So far we know:
- O is fixed in position 2.
- Letters already eliminated: A, R, S, E, M, U, T, H.
- Remaining common letters to test: D, N, L, C, G, I, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2.
- No eliminated letters.
- Good coverage of remaining common letters.

Candidate words:
- CLOUD → C, L, O, U, D  (but U is eliminated).
- GLOBE → G, L, O, B, E  (but E is eliminated).
- FOLLY → F, O, L, L, Y  (valid, but F and Y are less common).
- OLDEN → O, L, D, E, N  (but E is eliminated).
- GODLY → G, O, D, L, Y  (valid, covers G, D, L, Y).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to determine which letters might be in the secret word and their positions.

However, another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" because:
1. It has common letters (S, L, A, T, E)
2. The vowels A and E are very common
3. The consonants S, L, T are common
4. It covers different letter positions effectively

After considering various options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it hits many common letters and vowels.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 3).
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- O is somewhere in the word, but not in position 3.
- No A, R, S, or E appear in the word at all.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains an O (but not in position 3).
2. Contains none of A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc.
Good vowels: we already know O is present; we could try I or U if needed.

A good candidate is “COUNT”:
- C, O, U, N, T.
- O is in position 2 (not 3, so satisfies the feedback).
- No A, R, S, or E.
- Uses common letters C, U, N, T.

Another candidate is “MOUTH”:
- M, O, U, T, H.
- O in position 2 again.

I’ll choose “MOUTH” because it uses very common letters and gives good coverage.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: MOUTH -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) U(x) T(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. MOUTH → M(x) O(✓) U(x) T(x) H(x)  
   ⇒ O is in position 2 and is correct there.  
   ⇒ M, U, T, H are not in the word.  
   ⇒ A, R, S, E were already ruled out in the first guess.

So far we know:
- O is fixed in position 2.
- Letters already eliminated: A, R, S, E, M, U, T, H.
- Remaining common letters to test: D, N, L, C, G, I, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2.
- No eliminated letters.
- Good coverage of remaining common letters.

Candidate words:
- CLOUD → C, L, O, U, D  (but U is eliminated).
- GLOBE → G, L, O, B, E  (but E is eliminated).
- FOLLY → F, O, L, L, Y  (valid, but F and Y are less common).
- OLDEN → O, L, D, E, N  (but E is eliminated).
- GODLY → G, O, D, L, Y  (valid, covers G, D, L, Y).

""GODLY"" seems best because it tests the most common remaining letters (G, D, L, Y) while keeping O in position 2 and avoiding all eliminated letters.

Current constraints after three guesses:

1. O is fixed in position 2 (✓ from MOUTH).
2. Letters known to be in the word but position unknown: G (-), D (✓), Y (✓).
3. Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, S, E, M, U, T, H, L.

So the pattern is:
- Position 1: not A, R, S, E, M, U, T, H, L. Remaining common letters: B, C, F, G, I, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
- Position 2: O (fixed).
- Position 3: D (✓), so D must be here.
- Position 4: must be one of the remaining letters after placing G and Y.
- Position 5: must be Y (✓).

We also know G is in the word but not in position 1 (from GODLY feedback: G(-)), so G must be in position 4.

Thus the word must be: _ O D G Y.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits _ O D G Y. The only common English word that fits is ""BODGY"" (though ""BODGY"" is informal), but ""BOGGY"" is invalid (double G). The correct and common word is ""BODGE"" but E is eliminated.

Wait, checking valid 5-letter words: ""BOGGY"" is invalid (two G's), ""BODGY"" is valid but less common. Actually, the correct and common word is ""BODGE"" but E is eliminated.

Looking again: ""C"" is still available. ""C"" can be in position 1. The word would be ""C O D G Y"" which is ""CODGY"" - but this is not a common word.

The only valid common word fitting _ O D G Y is ""BODGY"" but B is still available.

But let's think differently: the word must be _ O D G Y. The only valid English word here is ""BODGY"" (as in ""bodgy"" adjective meaning clumsy), but it's not very common.

Actually, the correct and common word is ""BODGE"" but E is eliminated.

Wait, perhaps I missed another possibility. Let me re-examine:

We have:
- Positions: _ O D _ Y
- G must be in position 4 (since it's in the word but not in position 1 or 4? No, from GODLY feedback G is in the word but not in position 1 (G(-)), and from previous guesses it's not in position 4 (from GODLY feedback: G(-) means not in position 1, and D is in position 3, Y in 5, so G must be in position 4).

Thus the word must be: _ O D G Y.

Valid 5-letter words ending with ODGY:
- ""BODGY"" is valid (rare)
- ""CODGY"" - not valid
- ""FODGY"" - not valid
- ""GODGY"" - invalid (already has G in position 1)
- ""HODGY"" - H eliminated
- ""JODGY"" - not valid
- ""KODGY"" - not valid
- ""NODGY"" - N is available, word exists

""NODGY"" is a valid word (rare), but more common is ""NODGE"" but E is eliminated.

Actually, the most likely valid word is ""BODGY"" but let's check if there's a better fit.

Upon reflection, the correct and common word fitting _ O D G Y is ""BODGY"".

But let's verify:
- B is still available (not eliminated)
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- D is in position 3 (✓)
- G is in position 4 (must be, since G is in word and not in position 1 or 4? No, G is in position 4 here)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)

Thus, the correct guess is ""BODGY"".

However, ""BODGY"" is quite rare. Let me check if there's another word.

Actually, the word must be _ O D G Y. The only valid English word here is ""BODGY"".

Therefore, the next guess is ""BODGY"".Based on the feedback:
- O is fixed in position 2.
- D must be in position 3 (✓ from GODLY).
- Y must be in position 5 (✓ from GODLY).
- G must be in position 4 (since it's in the word but not in position 1 or 4? No, G is in position 4 here).
- Position 1 must be a letter not yet eliminated.
