### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, S, L, etc.).

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions. If any of these letters appear in the secret word, we'll get useful feedback right away.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.

- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: R, E
- Letters definitely not in the word: A, O, S

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively).
2. Does not contain A, O, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible common letters left: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, H, etc.

Let me try ""UNTIE"":
- U, N, T, I, E
- Contains E but not in position 5 (good, since E was in position 5 last time).
- Does not contain A, O, S.
- R is not in this word, but we can test other letters.

Wait, but we know R is in the word somewhere, so this guess doesn't include R. That's a mistake - I should include R.

Let me try ""UNTIE"" again - no, that's wrong. Let me think of a word with R and E.

""CRUEL"":
- C, R, U, E, L
- R in position 2 (was position 2 last time, but feedback was ""-"", so R can't be in position 2. This guess is invalid.)

""INTER"":
- I, N, T, E, R
- E in position 4 (not 5, good).

- Doesn't contain A, O, S.
- Uses new letters I, N, T.

This seems good.

Alternative: ""TIGER"":
- T, I, G, E, R
- E in position 4, R in position 5 (both positions are new for these letters).
- Also good.

Between these, ""INTER"" seems better as it tests more letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, I, N
2. Letters definitely in the word: T (position 3 is correct), R, E
   - R cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from arose and inter feedback)
   - E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from arose and inter feedback)

So R must be in positions 1, 3, or 4, and E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (but T is already in 3).

Since T is locked in position 3, the word structure is:
_ _ T _ _

R must be in position 1 or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5, and 3 is T)
E must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (but 3 is T), so E must be in 1 or 2

Let's consider possibilities:
- If E is in position 1: E T R _ _  (but R would have to be in 4)
- If E is in position 2: _ E T _ _  (but R would have to be in 1 or 4)

Also, we need to test new common letters not yet used: C, D, G, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let's try a word that places E in position 2 and R in position 1, and introduces new common letters:
R E T _ _

Looking for 5-letter words fitting this pattern: RET... possibilities include RETUG, RETCH, RETMA (but not all are valid). A valid common word is ""RETCH"".

""RETCH"":
- R in position 1 (valid, since R can't be 2 or 5)
- E in position 2 (valid, since E can't be 4 or 5)
- T in position 3 (correct)
- C and H are new letters

- E in position 4 (not 5, good).
- R in position 5 (not 2, good).
- Doesn't contain A, O, S.
- Uses new letters I, N, T.

This seems good.

Alternative: ""TIGER"":
- T, I, G, E, R
- E in position 4, R in position 5 (both positions are new for these letters).
- Also good.

Between these, ""INTER"" seems better as it tests more letters.

Let's go with ""INTER"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: inter -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(x) T(✓) E(-) R(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, I, N
2. Letters definitely in the word: T (position 3 is correct), R, E
   - R cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from arose and inter feedback)
   - E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from arose and inter feedback)

So R must be in positions 1, 3, or 4, and E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (but T is already in 3).

Since T is locked in position 3, the word structure is:
_ _ T _ _

R must be in position 1 or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5, and 3 is T)
E must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (but 3 is T), so E must be in 1 or 2

Let's consider possibilities:
- If E is in position 1: E T R _ _  (but R would have to be in 4)
- If E is in position 2: _ E T _ _  (but R would have to be in 1 or 4)

Also, we need to test new common letters not yet used: C, D, G, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let's try a word that places E in position 2 and R in position 1, and introduces new common letters:
R E T _ _

Looking for 5-letter words fitting this pattern: RET... possibilities include RETUG, RETCH, RETMA (but not all are valid). A valid common word is ""RETCH"".

""RETCH"":
- R in position 1 (valid, since R can't be 2 or 5)
- E in position 2 (valid, since E can't be 4 or 5)
- T in position 3 (correct)
- C and H are new letters
- No forbidden letters (A, O, S, I, N)

This seems like a good next guess.

We now have three rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
2. inter → I(x) N(x) T(✓) E(-) R(-)
3. retch → R(✓) E(✓) T(✓) C(x) H(x)

From these we can deduce:

- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, I, N, C, H
- Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct positions:
  – R is position 1
  – E is position 2
  – T is position 3

So the word so far is: R E T _ _

We still need two more letters (positions 4 and 5) that:
  • are not any of the letters already eliminated (A, O, S, I, N, C, H)
  • have not yet been tested

Common remaining consonants: D, G, L, M, P, U, Y, B, F, K, V, W, Z  
Common remaining vowels: U (since A, O, E are already handled)

Let’s look for a valid 5-letter English word that fits R E T _ _ and uses only allowed letters.

Possible endings:
- RETUD  (not a word)
- REGMA  (not a word)
- REPUD  (not a word)
- RETUM  (not a word)
- RETRY  (valid word, and Y has not been used)

""RETRY"":
- Letters: R, E, T, R, Y
- R is already confirmed in position 1, so the second R is allowed (some letters can repeat).
- Y is a new letter that hasn’t been tested yet.
- All letters are allowed by current constraints.

This seems to be the only common English word that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters.
