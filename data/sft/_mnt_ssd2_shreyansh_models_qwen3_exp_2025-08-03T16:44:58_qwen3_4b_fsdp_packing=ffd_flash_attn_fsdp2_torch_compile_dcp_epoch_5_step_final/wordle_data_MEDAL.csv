For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give us good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on “arose” we now know:

- A is in the word but in the wrong place (it is NOT in position 1).
- R, O, S are NOT in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong place (it is NOT in position 5).

So we must use a word that:
- contains A and E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively),
- does NOT contain R, O, S,
- uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants are T, N, L, C, D, G, H, M, etc.  
A useful word would place A and E in different positions and test new common letters.  
“TREAD” is invalid (contains R and T, but R is out).  
“LEANT” is valid: it has A (not in position 1), E (not in position 5), and tests L, N, T.  
“CLEAN” is also valid: C, L, E, A, N.  
Between these, “CLEAN” introduces C and L while keeping A and E in new positions.

I’ll go with CLEAN.

From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - R, O, S are not in the word.

2. clean → C(x) L(-) E(-) A(✓) N(x)
   - A is now confirmed to be in position 4 (✓).
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 3.
   - C and N are not in the word.

So we know:
- Word must have A in position 4.
- Word must contain L and E, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- Word cannot contain R, O, S, C, N.

Letters we can use: A (fixed at position 4), plus any of B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, but we want common ones.

We need L and E in positions they haven't been ruled out for:
- L cannot be in position 2.
- E cannot be in position 3 or 5 (from arose) and not in position 3 (from clean), so E must be in 1, 2, or 4. But position 4 is A, so E must be in 1 or 2.

Possible positions:
- E in 1: E _ A _ _
- E in 2: _ E A _ _

L must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 4 is A), so:
- If E is in 1: L must be in 3 or 5 → E _ A L _ or E _ A _ L
- If E is in 2: L must be in 3 or 5 → _ E A L _ or _ E A _ L

We need to pick a word that fits these patterns, uses common letters, and doesn't repeat any ruled-out letters.

Looking at common words:
- E A L _ _: ""eal_"" - not common
- E _ A L _: ""exalm"" - has M, but X is uncommon
- _ E A L _: ""heal"" - but needs 5 letters
- _ E A _ L: ""meals"" - has S (ruled out), so no
- _ E A L _: ""beach"" - has C (ruled out), so no
- ""deal"" - has D, E, A, L, but needs 5 letters
- ""legal"" - has L, E, G, A, L - but L is repeated, and G is okay
- ""jealous"" - too long
- ""leapt"" - has P, T
- ""elegant"" - has N (ruled out)
- ""eclat"" - has C (ruled out)
- ""elbow"" - has O (ruled out)
- ""elpid"" - not a word
- ""eleva"" - not a word
- ""elite"" - has I, T, but T is ok
- ""eller"" - has R (ruled out)
- ""eleva"" - not a word
- ""elegant"" - N is out
- ""eclat"" - C is out
- ""eleva"" - not a word
- ""eleva"" - not a word
- ""eleva"" - not a word

Looking again:
- E A L _ _ : ""eagle"" - has G, E, A, L, E - but E is repeated, and we don't know if E can be repeated. The rules don't forbid it, but we should assume letters are unique unless proven otherwise.
- E _ A L _ : ""eclal"" - not a word
- _ E A L _ : ""dearl"" - has D, E, A, R, L - R is out
- _ E A _ L : ""meant"" - N is out, T is ok
- _ E A _ L : ""beast"" - S is out
- _ E A _ L : ""keeps"" - S is out
- _ E A _ L : ""peels"" - S is out
- _ E A _ L : ""cheels"" - C is out, S is out
- _ E A _ L : ""heep"" - too short
- _ E A _ L : ""peel"" - too short
- _ E A _ L : ""eel"" - too short

Hmm, struggling to find common words. Maybe we need to try:

- E A L _ _ : ""eagle"" - even though E is repeated, it's a valid word. Let's try it.
- Alternatively, ""eal"" is not a word, so maybe ""eagle"" is the closest.

But ""eagle"" has E in position 1 and 5, which might be allowed. The rules don't say letters can't repeat, so it's possible.

Another option:
- _ E A L _ : ""legal"" - L is repeated, but legal is a valid word. This uses L twice, which might be acceptable.

Between these, ""legal"" seems more likely:
- L E A L _ : but A is fixed at position 4, so ""legal"" would be L E A L _, which is 4 letters, not 5.
Wait, ""legal"" is 5 letters: L E A G A L - but A is fixed at position 4, so this would be L E A G A L - but that's 6 letters.

I need to be careful - the word must be exactly 5 letters.

Let me re-examine possible patterns:

We know:
- Position 4 is A.
- Must contain L and E, but:
   - L cannot be in position 2
   - E cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from arose) and not in position 3 (from clean), so E must be in 1 or 2
   - L can be in 1, 3, 5

So possible combinations:
Case 1: E in position 1
   E _ A _ _
   L must be in 3 or 5
   Possible: E L A _ _ or E _ A L _
   - E L A _ _ : ""elate"" - T is ok, but E is in 1, L in 2 - but L cannot be in 2 (from clean feedback: L is in word but wrong position, and in clean L was in position 2, so it cannot be in 2 again). So ""elate"" is invalid (L would be in 2).
   - E _ A L _ : ""eclal"" - not a word, ""eclat"" - C is out, ""eblat"" - not a word, ""eflat"" - not a word, ""eplum"" - not a word...

Case 2: E in position 2
   _ E A _ _
   L must be in 3 or 5
   Possible: _ E A L _ or _ E A _ L
   - _ E A L _ : ""beal_"" - ""beals"" - S is out, ""deals"" - S is out, ""feals"" - not a word, ""heals"" - S is out, ""jeals"" - not a word, ""keals"" - not a word, ""leals"" - S is out, ""meals"" - S is out, ""peals"" - S is out, ""seals"" - S is out, ""teals"" - S is out
   - _ E A _ L : ""deeper"" - P is ok, but E is in 2, so ""deeper"" is D E E P E R - but E is repeated, and R is out
   - ""tread"" - R is out
   - ""bleed"" - D is ok, B is ok, but E is in 2, so B L E E D - but E is repeated, and D is ok
   - ""bleed"" is a valid word: B L E E D - positions: B(1), L(2), E(3) - but E cannot be in 3 (from clean feedback: E is in word but wrong position, and in clean E was in position 3, so it cannot be in 3 again). So ""bleed"" is invalid (E would be in 3).
   - ""cheep"" - C is out
   - ""sheer"" - S is out, R is out
   - ""cheep"" - C is out
   - ""peeler"" - P, E, E, L, R - R is out, E is repeated
   - ""beeler"" - R is out
   - ""heeler"" - R is out
   - ""leerer"" - R is out
   - ""peeler"" - R is out
   - ""sheeler"" - R is out
   - ""zeeler"" - R is out

This is tricky. Let me think of common 5-letter words with A in position 4, containing L and E, avoiding ruled-out letters.

Looking at the constraints:
- A is in position 4 (✓)
- Must contain L (not in position 2)
- Must contain E (not in positions 3 or 5)
- Cannot contain R, O, S, C, N

Possible positions for E: 1 or 2
Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 5

Let's try:
- E in 1, L in 3: E _ A L _
   - E _ A L _ : ""eclal"" - not a word, ""eclad"" - not a word, ""eclam"" - not a word, ""eclan"" - N is out, ""eclas"" - S is out, ""eclat"" - C is out, ""eblad"" - not a word, ""elead"" - not a word, ""eleva"" - not a word, ""elegal"" - too long
- E in 1, L in 5: E _ A _ L
   - E _ A _ L : ""eclal"" - C is out, ""eblal"" - not a word, ""eflal"" - not a word, ""emal"" - too short, ""epal"" - too short, ""eual"" - not a word
- E in 2, L in 3: _ E A L _
   - _ E A L _ : ""beal_"" - ""beals"" - S is out, ""deals"" - S is out, ""feals"" - not a word, ""heals"" - S is out, ""jeals"" - not a word, ""keals"" - not a word, ""leals"" - S is out, ""meals"" - S is out, ""peals"" - S is out, ""seals"" - S is out, ""teals"" - S is out
   - ""peal"" is 4 letters
   - ""cheal"" - C is out
   - ""sheal"" - S is out
   - ""leap"" - too short
   - ""mea"" - too short
- E in 2, L in 5: _ E A _ L
   - _ E A _ L : ""deeper"" - P is ok, but E is in 2, so D E E P E R - but E is repeated, and R is out
   - ""tread"" - R is out
   - ""bleed"" - E is in 3, which is invalid
   - ""cheel"" - C is out
   - ""sheel"" - S is out
   - ""peel"" - too short
   - ""melee"" - E is in 5, which is invalid
   - ""feeler"" - R is out
   - ""heeler"" - R is out
   - ""leeler"" - R is out
   - ""peeler"" - R is out
   - ""sheeler"" - R is out
   - ""zeeler"" - R is out

This is very restrictive. Let me try ""eagle"":
- E A L _ _ : ""eagle"" - E A L E G - but this has E in 1 and 4, but position 4 is A, so this doesn't fit. Wait, ""eagle"" is E A G L E, which would have A in position 2, but we know A is in position 4. So ""eagle"" is invalid.

Another word: ""eal"" is not a word. ""eaten"" - N is out.

This seems difficult. Maybe the word is ""legal"" but that's 5 letters: L E G A L - but A is in position 4, so this would be L E G A L - but that's 5 letters: positions 1=L, 2=E, 3=G, 4=A, 5=L. This uses L twice, but it's a valid word. Let's check constraints:
- A is in position 4 (✓)
- Contains L (positions 1 and 5) - ok, since L just can't be in position 2
- Contains E in position 2 - ok, since E can't be in 3 or 5
- Doesn't contain R, O, S, C, N
- Uses common letters G is ok

So ""legal"" seems to fit all constraints.

But let me double-check:
- From arose: A(-) - A is in word but not position 1
- From clean: A(✓) - A is in position 4
- So A is fixed at position 4
- From clean: L(-) - L is in word but not position 2
- From clean: E(-) - E is in word but not position 3
- From clean: E(-) again - E is in word but not position 3 (already known)
- From clean: A(✓) - A is in position 4
- From clean: N(x) - N not in word
- From arose: R(x), O(x), S(x) - these are out
- So letters allowed: A (fixed at 4), plus any not ruled out
- ""legal"" uses L, E, G, A, L - all allowed letters, and positions:
   1: L - allowed (not position 2)
   2: E - allowed (not position 3 or 5)
   3: G - allowed
   4: A - fixed
   5: L - allowed (not position 2)

This seems correct. I'll go with ""legal"".
</think>

<guess>legal</guess>",legal,"From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - R, O, S are not in the word.

2. clean → C(x) L(-) E(-) A(✓) N(x)
   - A is now confirmed to be in position 4 (✓).
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 3.
   - C and N are not in the word.

So we know:
- Word must have A in position 4.
- Word must contain L and E, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- Word cannot contain R, O, S, C, N.

Letters we can use: A (fixed at position 4), plus any of B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, but we want common ones.

We need L and E in positions they haven't been ruled out for:
- L cannot be in position 2.
- E cannot be in position 3 or 5 (from arose) and not in position 3 (from clean), so E must be in 1, 2, or 4. But position 4 is A, so E must be in 1 or 2.

Possible positions:
- E in 1: E _ A _ _
- E in 2: _ E A _ _

L must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 4 is A), so:
- If E is in 1: L must be in 3 or 5 → E _ A L _ or E _ A _ L
- If E is in 2: L must be in 3 or 5 → _ E A L _ or _ E A _ L

We need to pick a word that fits these patterns, uses common letters, and doesn't repeat any ruled-out letters.

Looking at common words:
- E A L _ _: ""eal_"" - not common
- E _ A L _: ""exalm"" - has M, but X is uncommon
- _ E A L _: ""heal"" - but needs 5 letters
- _ E A _ L: ""meals"" - has S (ruled out), so no
- _ E A L _: ""beach"" - has C (ruled out), so no
- ""deal"" - has D, E, A, L, but needs 5 letters
- ""legal"" - has L, E, G, A, L - but L is repeated, and G is okay
- ""jealous"" - too long
- ""leapt"" - has P, T
- ""elegant"" - has N (ruled out)
- ""eclat"" - has C (ruled out)
- ""elbow"" - has O (ruled out)
- ""elpid"" - not a word
- ""eleva"" - not a word
- ""elite"" - has I, T, but T is ok
- ""eller"" - has R (ruled out)
- ""eleva"" - not a word
- ""elegant"" - N is out
- ""eclat"" - C is out
- ""eleva"" - not a word
- ""eleva"" - not a word
- ""eleva"" - not a word

Looking again:
- E A L _ _ : ""eagle"" - has G, E, A, L, E - but E is repeated, and we don't know if E can be repeated. The rules don't forbid it, but we should assume letters are unique unless proven otherwise.
- E _ A L _ : ""eclal"" - not a word
- _ E A L _ : ""dearl"" - has D, E, A, R, L - R is out
- _ E A _ L : ""meant"" - N is out, T is ok
- _ E A _ L : ""beast"" - S is out
- _ E A _ L : ""keeps"" - S is out
- _ E A _ L : ""peels"" - S is out
- _ E A _ L : ""cheels"" - C is out, S is out
- _ E A _ L : ""heep"" - too short
- _ E A _ L : ""peel"" - too short
- _ E A _ L : ""eel"" - too short

Hmm, struggling to find common words. Maybe we need to try:

- E A L _ _ : ""eagle"" - even though E is repeated, it's a valid word. Let's try it.
- Alternatively, ""eal"" is not a word, so maybe ""eagle"" is the closest.

But ""eagle"" has E in position 1 and 5, which might be allowed. The rules don't say letters can't repeat, so it's possible.

Another option:
- _ E A L _ : ""legal"" - L is repeated, but legal is a valid word. This uses L twice, which might be acceptable.

Between these, ""legal"" seems more likely:
- L E A L _ : but A is fixed at position 4, so ""legal"" would be L E A L _, which is 4 letters, not 5.
Wait, ""legal"" is 5 letters: L E A G A L - but A is fixed at position 4, so this would be L E A G A L - but that's 6 letters.

I need to be careful - the word must be exactly 5 letters.

Let me re-examine possible patterns:

We know:
- Position 4 is A.
- Must contain L and E, but:
   - L cannot be in position 2
   - E cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from arose) and not in position 3 (from clean), so E must be in 1 or 2
   - L can be in 1, 3, 5

So possible combinations:
Case 1: E in position 1
   E _ A _ _
   L must be in 3 or 5
   Possible: E L A _ _ or E _ A L _
   - E L A _ _ : ""elate"" - T is ok, but E is in 1, L in 2 - but L cannot be in 2 (from clean feedback: L is in word but wrong position, and in clean L was in position 2, so it cannot be in 2 again). So ""elate"" is invalid (L would be in 2).
   - E _ A L _ : ""eclal"" - not a word, ""eclat"" - C is out, ""eblat"" - not a word, ""eflat"" - not a word, ""eplum"" - not a word...

Case 2: E in position 2
   _ E A _ _
   L must be in 3 or 5
   Possible: _ E A L _ or _ E A _ L
   - _ E A L _ : ""beal_"" - ""beals"" - S is out, ""deals"" - S is out, ""feals"" - not a word, ""heals"" - S is out, ""jeals"" - not a word, ""keals"" - not a word, ""leals"" - S is out, ""meals"" - S is out, ""peals"" - S is out, ""seals"" - S is out, ""teals"" - S is out
   - _ E A _ L : ""deeper"" - P is ok, but E is in 2, so ""deeper"" is D E E P E R - but E is repeated, and R is out
   - ""tread"" - R is out
   - ""bleed"" - D is ok, B is ok, but E is in 2, so B L E E D - but E is repeated, and D is ok
   - ""bleed"" is a valid word: B L E E D - positions: B(1), L(2), E(3) - but E cannot be in 3 (from clean feedback: E is in word but wrong position, and in clean E was in position 3, so it cannot be in 3 again). So ""bleed"" is invalid (E would be in 3).
   - ""cheep"" - C is out
   - ""sheer"" - S is out, R is out
   - ""cheep"" - C is out
   - ""peeler"" - P, E, E, L, R - R is out, E is repeated
   - ""beeler"" - R is out
   - ""heeler"" - R is out
   - ""leerer"" - R is out
   - ""peeler"" - R is out
   - ""sheeler"" - R is out
   - ""zeeler"" - R is out

This is tricky. Let me think of common 5-letter words with A in position 4, containing L and E, avoiding ruled-out letters.

Looking at the constraints:
- A is in position 4 (✓)
- Must contain L (not in position 2)
- Must contain E (not in positions 3 or 5)
- Cannot contain R, O, S, C, N

Possible positions for E: 1 or 2
Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 5

Let's try:
- E in 1, L in 3: E _ A L _
   - E _ A L _ : ""eclal"" - not a word, ""eclad"" - not a word, ""eclam"" - not a word, ""eclan"" - N is out, ""eclas"" - S is out, ""eclat"" - C is out, ""eblad"" - not a word, ""elead"" - not a word, ""eleva"" - not a word, ""elegal"" - too long
- E in 1, L in 5: E _ A _ L
   - E _ A _ L : ""eclal"" - C is out, ""eblal"" - not a word, ""eflal"" - not a word, ""emal"" - too short, ""epal"" - too short, ""eual"" - not a word
- E in 2, L in 3: _ E A L _
   - _ E A L _ : ""beal_"" - ""beals"" - S is out, ""deals"" - S is out, ""feals"" - not a word, ""heals"" - S is out, ""jeals"" - not a word, ""keals"" - not a word, ""leals"" - S is out, ""meals"" - S is out, ""peals"" - S is out, ""seals"" - S is out, ""teals"" - S is out
   - ""peal"" is 4 letters
   - ""cheal"" - C is out
   - ""sheal"" - S is out
   - ""leap"" - too short
   - ""mea"" - too short
- E in 2, L in 5: _ E A _ L
   - _ E A _ L : ""deeper"" - P is ok, but E is in 2, so D E E P E R - but E is repeated, and R is out
   - ""tread"" - R is out
   - ""bleed"" - E is in 3, which is invalid
   - ""cheel"" - C is out
   - ""sheel"" - S is out
   - ""peel"" - too short
   - ""melee"" - E is in 5, which is invalid
   - ""feeler"" - R is out
   - ""heeler"" - R is out
   - ""leeler"" - R is out
   - ""peeler"" - R is out
   - ""sheeler"" - R is out
   - ""zeeler"" - R is out

This is very restrictive. Let me try ""eagle"":
- E A L _ _ : ""eagle"" - E A L E G - but this has E in 1 and 4, but position 4 is A, so this doesn't fit. Wait, ""eagle"" is E A G L E, which would have A in position 2, but we know A is in position 4. So ""eagle"" is invalid.

Another word: ""eal"" is not a word. ""eaten"" - N is out.

This seems difficult. Maybe the word is ""legal"" but that's 5 letters: L E G A L - but A is in position 4, so this would be L E G A L - but that's 5 letters: positions 1=L, 2=E, 3=G, 4=A, 5=L. This uses L twice, but it's a valid word. Let's check constraints:
- A is in position 4 (✓)
- Contains L (positions 1 and 5) - ok, since L just can't be in position 2
- Contains E in position 2 - ok, since E can't be in 3 or 5
- Doesn't contain R, O, S, C, N
- Uses common letters G is ok

So ""legal"" seems to fit all constraints.

But let me double-check:
- From arose: A(-) - A is in word but not position 1
- From clean: A(✓) - A is in position 4
- So A is fixed at position 4
- From clean: L(-) - L is in word but not position 2
- From clean: E(-) - E is in word but not position 3
- From clean: E(-) again - E is in word but not position 3 (already known)
- From clean: A(✓) - A is in position 4
- From clean: N(x) - N not in word
- From arose: R(x), O(x), S(x) - these are out
- So letters allowed: A (fixed at 4), plus any not ruled out
- ""legal"" uses L, E, G, A, L - all allowed letters, and positions:
   1: L - allowed (not position 2)
   2: E - allowed (not position 3 or 5)
   3: G - allowed
   4: A - fixed
   5: L - allowed (not position 2)

This seems correct. I'll go with ""legal"".",Guess 3: legal -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(✓) G(x) A(✓) L(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give us good coverage for the first guess.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose” we now know:

- A is in the word but in the wrong place (it is NOT in position 1).
- R, O, S are NOT in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong place (it is NOT in position 5).

So we must use a word that:
- contains A and E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively),
- does NOT contain R, O, S,
- uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants are T, N, L, C, D, G, H, M, etc.  
A useful word would place A and E in different positions and test new common letters.  
“TREAD” is invalid (contains R and T, but R is out).  
“LEANT” is valid: it has A (not in position 1), E (not in position 5), and tests L, N, T.  
“CLEAN” is also valid: C, L, E, A, N.  
Between these, “CLEAN” introduces C and L while keeping A and E in new positions.

I’ll go with CLEAN.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: clean -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) E(-) A(✓) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - R, O, S are not in the word.

2. clean → C(x) L(-) E(-) A(✓) N(x)
   - A is now confirmed to be in position 4 (✓).
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 3.
   - C and N are not in the word.

So we know:
- Word must have A in position 4.
- Word must contain L and E, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- Word cannot contain R, O, S, C, N.

Letters we can use: A (fixed at position 4), plus any of B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, but we want common ones.

We need L and E in positions they haven't been ruled out for:
- L cannot be in position 2.
- E cannot be in position 3 or 5 (from arose) and not in position 3 (from clean), so E must be in 1, 2, or 4. But position 4 is A, so E must be in 1 or 2.

Possible positions:
- E in 1: E _ A _ _
- E in 2: _ E A _ _

L must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 4 is A), so:
- If E is in 1: L must be in 3 or 5 → E _ A L _ or E _ A _ L
- If E is in 2: L must be in 3 or 5 → _ E A L _ or _ E A _ L

We need to pick a word that fits these patterns, uses common letters, and doesn't repeat any ruled-out letters.

Looking at common words:
- E A L _ _: ""eal_"" - not common
- E _ A L _: ""exalm"" - has M, but X is uncommon
- _ E A L _: ""heal"" - but needs 5 letters
- _ E A _ L: ""meals"" - has S (ruled out), so no
- _ E A L _: ""beach"" - has C (ruled out), so no
- ""deal"" - has D, E, A, L, but needs 5 letters
- ""legal"" - has L, E, G, A, L - but L is repeated, and G is okay
- ""jealous"" - too long
- ""leapt"" - has P, T
- ""elegant"" - has N (ruled out)
- ""eclat"" - has C (ruled out)
- ""elbow"" - has O (ruled out)
- ""elpid"" - not a word
- ""eleva"" - not a word
- ""elite"" - has I, T, but T is ok
- ""eller"" - has R (ruled out)
- ""eleva"" - not a word
- ""elegant"" - N is out
- ""eclat"" - C is out
- ""eleva"" - not a word
- ""eleva"" - not a word
- ""eleva"" - not a word

Looking again:
- E A L _ _ : ""eagle"" - has G, E, A, L, E - but E is repeated, and we don't know if E can be repeated. The rules don't forbid it, but we should assume letters are unique unless proven otherwise.
- E _ A L _ : ""eclal"" - not a word
- _ E A L _ : ""dearl"" - has D, E, A, R, L - R is out
- _ E A _ L : ""meant"" - N is out, T is ok
- _ E A _ L : ""beast"" - S is out
- _ E A _ L : ""keeps"" - S is out
- _ E A _ L : ""peels"" - S is out
- _ E A _ L : ""cheels"" - C is out, S is out
- _ E A _ L : ""heep"" - too short
- _ E A _ L : ""peel"" - too short
- _ E A _ L : ""eel"" - too short

Hmm, struggling to find common words. Maybe we need to try:

- E A L _ _ : ""eagle"" - even though E is repeated, it's a valid word. Let's try it.
- Alternatively, ""eal"" is not a word, so maybe ""eagle"" is the closest.

But ""eagle"" has E in position 1 and 5, which might be allowed. The rules don't say letters can't repeat, so it's possible.

Another option:
- _ E A L _ : ""legal"" - L is repeated, but legal is a valid word. This uses L twice, which might be acceptable.

- L E A L _ : but A is fixed at position 4, so ""legal"" would be L E A L _, which is 4 letters, not 5.
Wait, ""legal"" is 5 letters: L E A G A L - but A is fixed at position 4, so this would be L E A G A L - but that's 6 letters.

I need to be careful - the word must be exactly 5 letters.

- Position 4 is A.
- Must contain L and E, but:
   - L cannot be in position 2
   - E cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from arose) and not in position 3 (from clean), so E must be in 1 or 2
   - L can be in 1, 3, 5

So possible combinations:
Case 1: E in position 1
   E _ A _ _
   L must be in 3 or 5
   Possible: E L A _ _ or E _ A L _
   - E L A _ _ : ""elate"" - T is ok, but E is in 1, L in 2 - but L cannot be in 2 (from clean feedback: L is in word but wrong position, and in clean L was in position 2, so it cannot be in 2 again). So ""elate"" is invalid (L would be in 2).
   - E _ A L _ : ""eclal"" - not a word, ""eclat"" - C is out, ""eblat"" - not a word, ""eflat"" - not a word, ""eplum"" - not a word...

Case 2: E in position 2
   _ E A _ _
   L must be in 3 or 5
   Possible: _ E A L _ or _ E A _ L
   - _ E A L _ : ""beal_"" - ""beals"" - S is out, ""deals"" - S is out, ""feals"" - not a word, ""heals"" - S is out, ""jeals"" - not a word, ""keals"" - not a word, ""leals"" - S is out, ""meals"" - S is out, ""peals"" - S is out, ""seals"" - S is out, ""teals"" - S is out
   - _ E A _ L : ""deeper"" - P is ok, but E is in 2, so ""deeper"" is D E E P E R - but E is repeated, and R is out
   - ""tread"" - R is out
   - ""bleed"" - D is ok, B is ok, but E is in 2, so B L E E D - but E is repeated, and D is ok
   - ""bleed"" is a valid word: B L E E D - positions: B(1), L(2), E(3) - but E cannot be in 3 (from clean feedback: E is in word but wrong position, and in clean E was in position 3, so it cannot be in 3 again). So ""bleed"" is invalid (E would be in 3).
   - ""cheep"" - C is out
   - ""sheer"" - S is out, R is out
   - ""cheep"" - C is out
   - ""peeler"" - P, E, E, L, R - R is out, E is repeated
   - ""beeler"" - R is out
   - ""heeler"" - R is out
   - ""leerer"" - R is out
   - ""peeler"" - R is out
   - ""sheeler"" - R is out
   - ""zeeler"" - R is out

This is tricky. Let me think of common 5-letter words with A in position 4, containing L and E, avoiding ruled-out letters.

Looking at the constraints:
- A is in position 4 (✓)
- Must contain L (not in position 2)
- Must contain E (not in positions 3 or 5)
- Cannot contain R, O, S, C, N

Possible positions for E: 1 or 2
Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 5

Let's try:
- E in 1, L in 3: E _ A L _
   - E _ A L _ : ""eclal"" - not a word, ""eclad"" - not a word, ""eclam"" - not a word, ""eclan"" - N is out, ""eclas"" - S is out, ""eclat"" - C is out, ""eblad"" - not a word, ""elead"" - not a word, ""eleva"" - not a word, ""elegal"" - too long
- E in 1, L in 5: E _ A _ L
   - E _ A _ L : ""eclal"" - C is out, ""eblal"" - not a word, ""eflal"" - not a word, ""emal"" - too short, ""epal"" - too short, ""eual"" - not a word
- E in 2, L in 3: _ E A L _
   - _ E A L _ : ""beal_"" - ""beals"" - S is out, ""deals"" - S is out, ""feals"" - not a word, ""heals"" - S is out, ""jeals"" - not a word, ""keals"" - not a word, ""leals"" - S is out, ""meals"" - S is out, ""peals"" - S is out, ""seals"" - S is out, ""teals"" - S is out
   - ""peal"" is 4 letters
   - ""cheal"" - C is out
   - ""sheal"" - S is out
   - ""leap"" - too short
   - ""mea"" - too short
- E in 2, L in 5: _ E A _ L
   - _ E A _ L : ""deeper"" - P is ok, but E is in 2, so D E E P E R - but E is repeated, and R is out
   - ""tread"" - R is out
   - ""bleed"" - E is in 3, which is invalid
   - ""cheel"" - C is out
   - ""sheel"" - S is out
   - ""peel"" - too short
   - ""melee"" - E is in 5, which is invalid
   - ""feeler"" - R is out
   - ""heeler"" - R is out
   - ""leeler"" - R is out
   - ""peeler"" - R is out
   - ""sheeler"" - R is out
   - ""zeeler"" - R is out

This is very restrictive. Let me try ""eagle"":
- E A L _ _ : ""eagle"" - E A L E G - but this has E in 1 and 4, but position 4 is A, so this doesn't fit. Wait, ""eagle"" is E A G L E, which would have A in position 2, but we know A is in position 4. So ""eagle"" is invalid.

Another word: ""eal"" is not a word. ""eaten"" - N is out.

This seems difficult. Maybe the word is ""legal"" but that's 5 letters: L E G A L - but A is in position 4, so this would be L E G A L - but that's 5 letters: positions 1=L, 2=E, 3=G, 4=A, 5=L. This uses L twice, but it's a valid word. Let's check constraints:
- A is in position 4 (✓)
- Contains L (positions 1 and 5) - ok, since L just can't be in position 2
- Contains E in position 2 - ok, since E can't be in 3 or 5
- Doesn't contain R, O, S, C, N
- Uses common letters G is ok

So ""legal"" seems to fit all constraints.

But let me double-check:
- From arose: A(-) - A is in word but not position 1
- From clean: A(✓) - A is in position 4
- So A is fixed at position 4
- From clean: L(-) - L is in word but not position 2
- From clean: E(-) - E is in word but not position 3
- From clean: E(-) again - E is in word but not position 3 (already known)
- From clean: A(✓) - A is in position 4
- From clean: N(x) - N not in word
- From arose: R(x), O(x), S(x) - these are out
- So letters allowed: A (fixed at 4), plus any not ruled out
- ""legal"" uses L, E, G, A, L - all allowed letters, and positions:
   1: L - allowed (not position 2)
   2: E - allowed (not position 3 or 5)
   3: G - allowed
   4: A - fixed
   5: L - allowed (not position 2)

This seems correct. I'll go with ""legal"".

So ""bleed"" is invalid (E would be in 3).\n   - ""cheep"" - C is out\n   - ""sheer"" - S is out, R is out\n   - ""cheep"" - C is out\n   - ""peeler"" - P, E, E, L, R - R is out, E is repeated\n   - ""beeler"" - R is out\n   - ""heeler"" - R is out\n   - ""leerer"" - R is out\n   - ""peeler"" - R is out\n   - ""sheeler"" - R is out\n   - ""zeeler"" - R is out\n\nThis is tricky. Let me think of common 5-letter words with A in position 4, containing L and E, avoiding ruled-out letters.\n\nLooking at the constraints:\n- A is in position 4 (✓)\n- Must contain L (not in position 2)\n- Must contain E (not in positions 3 or 5)\n- Cannot contain R, O, S, C, N\n\nPossible positions for E: 1 or 2\nPossible positions for L: 1, 3, 5\n\nLet\'s try:\n- E in 1, L in 3: E _ A L _\n   - E _ A L _ : ""eclal"" - not a word, ""eclad"" - not a word, ""eclam"" - not a word, ""eclan"" - N is out, ""eclas"" - S is out, ""eclat"" - C is out, ""eblad"" - not a word, ""elead"" - not a word, ""eleva"" - not a word, ""elegal"" - too long\n- E in 1, L in 5: E _ A _ L\n   - E _ A _ L : ""eclal"" - C is out, ""eblal"" - not a word, ""eflal"" - not a word, ""emal"" - too short, ""epal"" - too short, ""eual"" - not a word\n- E in 2, L in 3: _ E A L _\n   - _ E A L _ : ""beal_"" - ""beals"" - S is out, ""deals"" - S is out, ""feals"" - not a word, ""heals"" - S is out, ""jeals"" - not a word, ""keals"" - not a word, ""leals"" - S is out, ""meals"" - S is out, ""peals"" - S is out, ""seals"" - S is out, ""teals"" - S is out\n   - ""peal"" is 4 letters\n   - ""cheal"" - C is out\n   - ""sheal"" - S is out\n   - ""leap"" - too short\n   - ""mea"" - too short\n- E in 2, L in 5: _ E A _ L\n   - _ E A _ L : ""deeper"" - P is ok, but E is in 2, so D E E P E R - but E is repeated, and R is out\n   - ""tread"" - R is out\n   - ""bleed"" - E is in 3, which is invalid\n   - ""cheel"" - C is out\n   - ""sheel"" - S is out\n   - ""peel"" - too short\n   - ""melee"" - E is in 5, which is invalid\n   - ""feeler"" - R is out\n   - ""heeler"" - R is out\n   - ""leeler"" - R is out\n   - ""peeler"" - R is out\n   - ""sheeler"" - R is out\n   - ""zeeler"" - R is out\n\nThis is very restrictive. Let me try ""eagle"":\n- E A L _ _ : ""eagle"" - E A L E G - but this has E in 1 and 4, but position 4 is A, so this doesn\'t fit. Wait, ""eagle"" is E A G L E, which would have A in position 2, but we know A is in position 4. So ""eagle"" is invalid.\n\nAnother word: ""eal"" is not a word. ""eaten"" - N is out.\n\nThis seems difficult. Maybe the word is ""legal"" but that\'s 5 letters: L E G A L - but A is in position 4, so this would be L E G A L - but that\'s 5 letters: positions 1=L, 2=E, 3=G, 4=A, 5=L. This uses L twice, but it\'s a valid word. Let\'s check constraints:\n- A is in position 4 (✓)\n- Contains L (positions 1 and 5) - ok, since L just can\'t be in position 2\n- Contains E in position 2 - ok, since E can\'t be in 3 or 5\n- Doesn\'t contain R, O, S, C, N\n- Uses common letters G is ok\n\nSo ""legal"" seems to fit all constraints.\n\nBut let me double-check:\n- From arose: A(-) - A is in word but not position 1\n- From clean: A(✓) - A is in position 4\n- So A is fixed at position 4\n- From clean: L(-) - L is in word but not position 2\n- From clean: E(-) - E is in word but not position 3\n- From clean: E(-) again - E is in word but not position 3 (already known)\n- From clean: A(✓) - A is in position 4\n- From clean: N(x) - N not in word\n- From arose: R(x), O(x), S(x) - these are out\n- So letters allowed: A (fixed at 4), plus any not ruled out\n- ""legal"" uses L, E, G, A, L - all allowed letters, and positions:\n   1: L - allowed (not position 2)\n   2: E - allowed (not position 3 or 5)\n   3: G - allowed\n   4: A - fixed\n   5: L - allowed (not position 2)\n\nThis seems correct. I\'ll go with ""legal"".\n\n<guess>legal</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: clean -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) E(-) A(✓) N(x)\nGuess 3: legal -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(✓) G(x) A(✓) L(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the latest feedback on “legal” we now know:

- L is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 5 (because it showed “-” in both places).
- E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
- A is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4).
- L is also in the correct position (position 5) … but the feedback said “-” there, which contradicts that.

Wait, let’s parse the feedback carefully:

Guess 3: legal  
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   L E G A L  
Feedback:  -  ✓  x  ✓  -

So:
- Position 1: L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- Position 2: E(✓) → E is in the word AND correctly placed at position 2.
- Position 3: G(x) → G is NOT in the word.
- Position 4: A(✓) → A is in the word AND correctly placed at position 4.
- Position 5: L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Therefore:
- Word pattern: _ E _ A _
- Must contain L, but L cannot be in positions 1 or 5.
- Hence L must be in position 3.
- Letters ruled out so far: R, O, S, C, N, G
- Remaining letters to try: common consonants like D, H, M, P, T, etc.

So the word must be: _ E L A _

Possible 5-letter words fitting _ E L A _:
- B E L A ? → “belas” (plural of bela, not common)
- D E L A ? → “dela_” not a word
- F E L A ? → “fela_” not a word
- H E L A ? → “hela_” not a word
- M E L A ? → “mela_” not a word
- P E L A ? → “pe la_” not a word
- T E L A ? → “tele_” but needs 5 letters
- V E L A ? → “vela_” not a word
- W E L A ? → “wela_” not a word
- K E L A ? → “kela_” not a word
- Z E L A ? → “zela_” not a word

Wait, common word: “t e l a _” doesn’t fit. Let me think differently.

Actually, the pattern is _ E L A _ (positions 2=E, 3=L, 4=A). The only common English 5-letter word that fits is:

- T E L A _ → “telam” not a word
- P E L A _ → “pe la_” not a word
- B E L A _ → “belar” not a word
- D E L A _ → “delaq” not a word

Hmm, seems limited. Let me check if any other letter fits position 1 and 5 while keeping L in 3.

Actually, position 5 can be any letter not ruled out, and position 1 can be any letter not ruled out (not L, E, A).

Looking at common words: “_ e l a _” the only one that comes to mind is:

- “q e l a _” no
- “x e l a _” no
- “j e l a _” no
- “k e l a _” no
- “m e l a _” no
- “v e l a _” no

Wait, let me try “d e l a v” not a word.

Actually, the correct word must be “t e l a _” but I’m missing it. Let me think of words ending with a consonant after A.

The only common word I can find is “t e l a _” which doesn’t fit. Let me try “b e l a _” again.

Wait, let me step back: pattern _ E L A _ (positions 2=E, 3=L, 4=A). The only valid word is:

- “b e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “d e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “f e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “h e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “k e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “m e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “p e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “v e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “w e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “y e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “z e l a _” doesn’t fit

This suggests I might have made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback:

Guess 3: legal → L(-) E(✓) G(x) A(✓) L(✓)

The feedback symbols are for each position:

- Position 1: L(-) → L not in position 1
- Position 2: E(✓) → E is correctly placed at position 2
- Position 3: G(x) → G not in word
- Position 4: A(✓) → A is correctly placed at position 4
- Position 5: L(✓) → L is correctly placed at position 5

This is contradictory: earlier it said L is not in position 1 or 5, but now position 5 shows L as correct. This must be a misinterpretation.

Let me re-interpret the feedback for guess 3:

Guess 3: legal  
Letters: L(1) E(2) G(3) A(4) L(5)  
Feedback: -  ✓  x  ✓  -

So:
- L at position 1: (-) → L not in position 1
- E at position 2: (✓) → E is correctly placed at position 2
- G at position 3: (x) → G not in word
- A at position 4: (✓) → A is correctly placed at position 4
- L at position 5: (-) → L not in position 5

Therefore:
- Word pattern: _ E _ A _
- Must contain L, but L cannot be in positions 1 or 5
- Hence L must be in position 3
- So word must be: _ E L A _

Now, looking for 5-letter words _ E L A _:

- B E L A _ → “belas” (plural of bela, not standard)
- D E L A _ → “dela_” not a word
- F E L A _ → “fela_” not a word
- H E L A _ → “hela_” not a word
- K E L A _ → “kela_” not a word
- M E L A _ → “mela_” not a word
- P E L A _ → “pe la_” not a word
- T E L A _ → “telam” not a word
- V E L A _ → “vela_” not a word
- W E L A _ → “wela_” not a word
- Y E L A _ → “yela_” not a word
- Z E L A _ → “zela_” not a word

The only standard English word that fits is “t e l a _” which doesn’t complete. This suggests I might have missed a word.

Wait, the word “t e l a _” doesn’t exist. Let me try “b e l a _” again.

Actually, the correct word must be “t e l a _” but I’m not finding it. Let me try “b e l a _” one more time.

After careful reconsideration, the only valid word that fits _ E L A _ is:

- “b e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “d e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “f e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “h e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “k e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “m e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “p e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “v e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “w e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “y e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “z e l a _” doesn’t fit

This indicates I might have made an error in interpreting the feedback. Let me re-examine:

Guess 3: legal → L(-) E(✓) G(x) A(✓) L(✓)

The feedback symbols are for each letter in the guess, not positions. So:

- L is in the word but not at position 1 (because it showed (-) there)
- E is in the word and at position 2 (✓)
- G is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and at position 4 (✓)
- L is in the word and at position 5 (✓)

This is contradictory: it says L is at position 5 (✓), but also that L is in the word but not at position 1 (-). This implies L must be at position 5, which seems to be the case.

Therefore, the word must be: _ E _ A L

Now, the pattern is _ E _ A L, and we know:
- Letters not in word: R, O, S, C, N, G
- Must contain L (already placed at 5)
- Other letters to try: common consonants like B, D, F, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y, Z

Looking for _ E _ A L:
- B E _ A L → “behal” not a word
- D E _ A L → “deval” not a word
- F E _ A L → “fehal” not a word
- H E _ A L → “hehal” not a word
- K E _ A L → “kehal” not a word
- M E _ A L → “meval” not a word
- P E _ A L → “pehal” not a word
- T E _ A L → “teval” not a word
- V E _ A L → “vehal” not a word
- W E _ A L → “wehal” not a word
- Y E _ A L → “yehal” not a word
- Z E _ A L → “zehal” not a word

The only common word that fits is “t e m p l” but that’s not valid. After careful search, the correct word must be:

“d e m a l” → but A is at 4, so “d e m a l” is invalid.

Wait, the pattern is _ E _ A L. The only valid word is:

“d e m a l” → invalid
“f e m a l” → invalid
“h e m a l” → invalid
“k e m a l” → invalid
“m e m a l” → invalid
“p e m a l” → invalid
“t e m a l” → invalid
“v e m a l” → invalid
“w e m a l” → invalid
“y e m a l” → invalid
“z e m a l” → invalid

This is perplexing. Let me try a different approach: list all 5-letter words with A at position 4 and E at position 2, and see which fits the constraints.

Words with pattern _ E _ A _:
- b e g a m → but G is out
- b e d a m → not a word
- d e m a n → N is out
- f e m a c → C is out
- h e m a t → T is ok
- k e m a t → K is ok
- m e m a t → M is ok
- p e m a t → P is ok
- t e m a p → P is ok
- v e m a t → V is ok
- w e m a t → W is ok
- y e m a t → Y is ok
- z e m a t → Z is ok

The word “h e m a t” is valid: H E M A T (short for hematologist, but “hemato” is not 5 letters). Actually, the correct word is “h e m a t” → “hemal”?

Let me try “hemal”:
- H E M A L → fits _ E _ A L
- Letters: H, E, M, A, L
- E is at 2 (✓), A is at 4 (✓), L is at 5 (✓)
- H and M are new letters not ruled out
- M is not ruled out
- This seems valid.

Therefore, the next guess is “hemal”.

</think>

Based on the latest feedback, the word must have:
- E in position 2
- A in position 4
- L in position 5
- No G, R, O, S, C, N

The only common 5-letter word fitting _ E _ A L is ""hemal"".

<guess>hemal</guess>",hemal,"From the latest feedback on “legal” we now know:

- L is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 5 (because it showed “-” in both places).
- E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
- A is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4).
- L is also in the correct position (position 5) … but the feedback said “-” there, which contradicts that.

Wait, let’s parse the feedback carefully:

Guess 3: legal  
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   L E G A L  
Feedback:  -  ✓  x  ✓  -

So:
- Position 1: L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- Position 2: E(✓) → E is in the word AND correctly placed at position 2.
- Position 3: G(x) → G is NOT in the word.
- Position 4: A(✓) → A is in the word AND correctly placed at position 4.
- Position 5: L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Therefore:
- Word pattern: _ E _ A _
- Must contain L, but L cannot be in positions 1 or 5.
- Hence L must be in position 3.
- Letters ruled out so far: R, O, S, C, N, G
- Remaining letters to try: common consonants like D, H, M, P, T, etc.

So the word must be: _ E L A _

Possible 5-letter words fitting _ E L A _:
- B E L A ? → “belas” (plural of bela, not common)
- D E L A ? → “dela_” not a word
- F E L A ? → “fela_” not a word
- H E L A ? → “hela_” not a word
- M E L A ? → “mela_” not a word
- P E L A ? → “pe la_” not a word
- T E L A ? → “tele_” but needs 5 letters
- V E L A ? → “vela_” not a word
- W E L A ? → “wela_” not a word
- K E L A ? → “kela_” not a word
- Z E L A ? → “zela_” not a word

Wait, common word: “t e l a _” doesn’t fit. Let me think differently.

Actually, the pattern is _ E L A _ (positions 2=E, 3=L, 4=A). The only common English 5-letter word that fits is:

- T E L A _ → “telam” not a word
- P E L A _ → “pe la_” not a word
- B E L A _ → “belar” not a word
- D E L A _ → “delaq” not a word

Hmm, seems limited. Let me check if any other letter fits position 1 and 5 while keeping L in 3.

Actually, position 5 can be any letter not ruled out, and position 1 can be any letter not ruled out (not L, E, A).

Looking at common words: “_ e l a _” the only one that comes to mind is:

- “q e l a _” no
- “x e l a _” no
- “j e l a _” no
- “k e l a _” no
- “m e l a _” no
- “v e l a _” no

Wait, let me try “d e l a v” not a word.

Actually, the correct word must be “t e l a _” but I’m missing it. Let me think of words ending with a consonant after A.

The only common word I can find is “t e l a _” which doesn’t fit. Let me try “b e l a _” again.

Wait, let me step back: pattern _ E L A _ (positions 2=E, 3=L, 4=A). The only valid word is:

- “b e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “d e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “f e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “h e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “k e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “m e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “p e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “v e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “w e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “y e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “z e l a _” doesn’t fit

This suggests I might have made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback:

Guess 3: legal → L(-) E(✓) G(x) A(✓) L(✓)

The feedback symbols are for each position:

- Position 1: L(-) → L not in position 1
- Position 2: E(✓) → E is correctly placed at position 2
- Position 3: G(x) → G not in word
- Position 4: A(✓) → A is correctly placed at position 4
- Position 5: L(✓) → L is correctly placed at position 5

This is contradictory: earlier it said L is not in position 1 or 5, but now position 5 shows L as correct. This must be a misinterpretation.

Let me re-interpret the feedback for guess 3:

Guess 3: legal  
Letters: L(1) E(2) G(3) A(4) L(5)  
Feedback: -  ✓  x  ✓  -

So:
- L at position 1: (-) → L not in position 1
- E at position 2: (✓) → E is correctly placed at position 2
- G at position 3: (x) → G not in word
- A at position 4: (✓) → A is correctly placed at position 4
- L at position 5: (-) → L not in position 5

Therefore:
- Word pattern: _ E _ A _
- Must contain L, but L cannot be in positions 1 or 5
- Hence L must be in position 3
- So word must be: _ E L A _

Now, looking for 5-letter words _ E L A _:

- B E L A _ → “belas” (plural of bela, not standard)
- D E L A _ → “dela_” not a word
- F E L A _ → “fela_” not a word
- H E L A _ → “hela_” not a word
- K E L A _ → “kela_” not a word
- M E L A _ → “mela_” not a word
- P E L A _ → “pe la_” not a word
- T E L A _ → “telam” not a word
- V E L A _ → “vela_” not a word
- W E L A _ → “wela_” not a word
- Y E L A _ → “yela_” not a word
- Z E L A _ → “zela_” not a word

The only standard English word that fits is “t e l a _” which doesn’t complete. This suggests I might have missed a word.

Wait, the word “t e l a _” doesn’t exist. Let me try “b e l a _” again.

Actually, the correct word must be “t e l a _” but I’m not finding it. Let me try “b e l a _” one more time.

After careful reconsideration, the only valid word that fits _ E L A _ is:

- “b e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “d e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “f e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “h e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “k e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “m e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “p e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “v e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “w e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “y e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “z e l a _” doesn’t fit

This indicates I might have made an error in interpreting the feedback. Let me re-examine:

Guess 3: legal → L(-) E(✓) G(x) A(✓) L(✓)

The feedback symbols are for each letter in the guess, not positions. So:

- L is in the word but not at position 1 (because it showed (-) there)
- E is in the word and at position 2 (✓)
- G is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and at position 4 (✓)
- L is in the word and at position 5 (✓)

This is contradictory: it says L is at position 5 (✓), but also that L is in the word but not at position 1 (-). This implies L must be at position 5, which seems to be the case.

Therefore, the word must be: _ E _ A L

Now, the pattern is _ E _ A L, and we know:
- Letters not in word: R, O, S, C, N, G
- Must contain L (already placed at 5)
- Other letters to try: common consonants like B, D, F, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y, Z

Looking for _ E _ A L:
- B E _ A L → “behal” not a word
- D E _ A L → “deval” not a word
- F E _ A L → “fehal” not a word
- H E _ A L → “hehal” not a word
- K E _ A L → “kehal” not a word
- M E _ A L → “meval” not a word
- P E _ A L → “pehal” not a word
- T E _ A L → “teval” not a word
- V E _ A L → “vehal” not a word
- W E _ A L → “wehal” not a word
- Y E _ A L → “yehal” not a word
- Z E _ A L → “zehal” not a word

The only common word that fits is “t e m p l” but that’s not valid. After careful search, the correct word must be:

“d e m a l” → but A is at 4, so “d e m a l” is invalid.

Wait, the pattern is _ E _ A L. The only valid word is:

“d e m a l” → invalid
“f e m a l” → invalid
“h e m a l” → invalid
“k e m a l” → invalid
“m e m a l” → invalid
“p e m a l” → invalid
“t e m a l” → invalid
“v e m a l” → invalid
“w e m a l” → invalid
“y e m a l” → invalid
“z e m a l” → invalid

This is perplexing. Let me try a different approach: list all 5-letter words with A at position 4 and E at position 2, and see which fits the constraints.

Words with pattern _ E _ A _:
- b e g a m → but G is out
- b e d a m → not a word
- d e m a n → N is out
- f e m a c → C is out
- h e m a t → T is ok
- k e m a t → K is ok
- m e m a t → M is ok
- p e m a t → P is ok
- t e m a p → P is ok
- v e m a t → V is ok
- w e m a t → W is ok
- y e m a t → Y is ok
- z e m a t → Z is ok

The word “h e m a t” is valid: H E M A T (short for hematologist, but “hemato” is not 5 letters). Actually, the correct word is “h e m a t” → “hemal”?

Let me try “hemal”:
- H E M A L → fits _ E _ A L
- Letters: H, E, M, A, L
- E is at 2 (✓), A is at 4 (✓), L is at 5 (✓)
- H and M are new letters not ruled out
- M is not ruled out
- This seems valid.

Therefore, the next guess is “hemal”.Based on the latest feedback, the word must have:
- E in position 2
- A in position 4
- L in position 5
- No G, R, O, S, C, N

The only common 5-letter word fitting _ E _ A L is ""hemal"".",Guess 4: hemal -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(✓) M(-) A(✓) L(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give us good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose” we now know:

- A is in the word but in the wrong place (it is NOT in position 1).
- R, O, S are NOT in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong place (it is NOT in position 5).

So we must use a word that:
- contains A and E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively),
- does NOT contain R, O, S,
- uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants are T, N, L, C, D, G, H, M, etc.  
A useful word would place A and E in different positions and test new common letters.  
“TREAD” is invalid (contains R and T, but R is out).  
“LEANT” is valid: it has A (not in position 1), E (not in position 5), and tests L, N, T.  
“CLEAN” is also valid: C, L, E, A, N.  
Between these, “CLEAN” introduces C and L while keeping A and E in new positions.

I’ll go with CLEAN.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: clean -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) E(-) A(✓) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - R, O, S are not in the word.

2. clean → C(x) L(-) E(-) A(✓) N(x)
   - A is now confirmed to be in position 4 (✓).
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 3.
   - C and N are not in the word.

So we know:
- Word must have A in position 4.
- Word must contain L and E, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- Word cannot contain R, O, S, C, N.

Letters we can use: A (fixed at position 4), plus any of B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, but we want common ones.

We need L and E in positions they haven't been ruled out for:
- L cannot be in position 2.
- E cannot be in position 3 or 5 (from arose) and not in position 3 (from clean), so E must be in 1, 2, or 4. But position 4 is A, so E must be in 1 or 2.

Possible positions:
- E in 1: E _ A _ _
- E in 2: _ E A _ _

L must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 4 is A), so:
- If E is in 1: L must be in 3 or 5 → E _ A L _ or E _ A _ L
- If E is in 2: L must be in 3 or 5 → _ E A L _ or _ E A _ L

We need to pick a word that fits these patterns, uses common letters, and doesn't repeat any ruled-out letters.

Looking at common words:
- E A L _ _: ""eal_"" - not common
- E _ A L _: ""exalm"" - has M, but X is uncommon
- _ E A L _: ""heal"" - but needs 5 letters
- _ E A _ L: ""meals"" - has S (ruled out), so no
- _ E A L _: ""beach"" - has C (ruled out), so no
- ""deal"" - has D, E, A, L, but needs 5 letters
- ""legal"" - has L, E, G, A, L - but L is repeated, and G is okay
- ""jealous"" - too long
- ""leapt"" - has P, T
- ""elegant"" - has N (ruled out)
- ""eclat"" - has C (ruled out)
- ""elbow"" - has O (ruled out)
- ""elpid"" - not a word
- ""eleva"" - not a word
- ""elite"" - has I, T, but T is ok
- ""eller"" - has R (ruled out)
- ""eleva"" - not a word
- ""elegant"" - N is out
- ""eclat"" - C is out
- ""eleva"" - not a word
- ""eleva"" - not a word
- ""eleva"" - not a word

Looking again:
- E A L _ _ : ""eagle"" - has G, E, A, L, E - but E is repeated, and we don't know if E can be repeated. The rules don't forbid it, but we should assume letters are unique unless proven otherwise.
- E _ A L _ : ""eclal"" - not a word
- _ E A L _ : ""dearl"" - has D, E, A, R, L - R is out
- _ E A _ L : ""meant"" - N is out, T is ok
- _ E A _ L : ""beast"" - S is out
- _ E A _ L : ""keeps"" - S is out
- _ E A _ L : ""peels"" - S is out
- _ E A _ L : ""cheels"" - C is out, S is out
- _ E A _ L : ""heep"" - too short
- _ E A _ L : ""peel"" - too short
- _ E A _ L : ""eel"" - too short

Hmm, struggling to find common words. Maybe we need to try:

- E A L _ _ : ""eagle"" - even though E is repeated, it's a valid word. Let's try it.
- Alternatively, ""eal"" is not a word, so maybe ""eagle"" is the closest.

But ""eagle"" has E in position 1 and 5, which might be allowed. The rules don't say letters can't repeat, so it's possible.

Another option:
- _ E A L _ : ""legal"" - L is repeated, but legal is a valid word. This uses L twice, which might be acceptable.

Between these, ""legal"" seems more likely:
- L E A L _ : but A is fixed at position 4, so ""legal"" would be L E A L _, which is 4 letters, not 5.
Wait, ""legal"" is 5 letters: L E A G A L - but A is fixed at position 4, so this would be L E A G A L - but that's 6 letters.

I need to be careful - the word must be exactly 5 letters.

Let me re-examine possible patterns:

We know:
- Position 4 is A.
- Must contain L and E, but:
   - L cannot be in position 2
   - E cannot be in positions 3 or 5 (from arose) and not in position 3 (from clean), so E must be in 1 or 2
   - L can be in 1, 3, 5

So possible combinations:
Case 1: E in position 1
   E _ A _ _
   L must be in 3 or 5
   Possible: E L A _ _ or E _ A L _
   - E L A _ _ : ""elate"" - T is ok, but E is in 1, L in 2 - but L cannot be in 2 (from clean feedback: L is in word but wrong position, and in clean L was in position 2, so it cannot be in 2 again). So ""elate"" is invalid (L would be in 2).
   - E _ A L _ : ""eclal"" - not a word, ""eclat"" - C is out, ""eblat"" - not a word, ""eflat"" - not a word, ""eplum"" - not a word...

Case 2: E in position 2
   _ E A _ _
   L must be in 3 or 5
   Possible: _ E A L _ or _ E A _ L
   - _ E A L _ : ""beal_"" - ""beals"" - S is out, ""deals"" - S is out, ""feals"" - not a word, ""heals"" - S is out, ""jeals"" - not a word, ""keals"" - not a word, ""leals"" - S is out, ""meals"" - S is out, ""peals"" - S is out, ""seals"" - S is out, ""teals"" - S is out
   - _ E A _ L : ""deeper"" - P is ok, but E is in 2, so ""deeper"" is D E E P E R - but E is repeated, and R is out
   - ""tread"" - R is out
   - ""bleed"" - D is ok, B is ok, but E is in 2, so B L E E D - but E is repeated, and D is ok
   - ""bleed"" is a valid word: B L E E D - positions: B(1), L(2), E(3) - but E cannot be in 3 (from clean feedback: E is in word but wrong position, and in clean E was in position 3, so it cannot be in 3 again). So ""bleed"" is invalid (E would be in 3).
   - ""cheep"" - C is out
   - ""sheer"" - S is out, R is out
   - ""cheep"" - C is out
   - ""peeler"" - P, E, E, L, R - R is out, E is repeated
   - ""beeler"" - R is out
   - ""heeler"" - R is out
   - ""leerer"" - R is out
   - ""peeler"" - R is out
   - ""sheeler"" - R is out
   - ""zeeler"" - R is out

This is tricky. Let me think of common 5-letter words with A in position 4, containing L and E, avoiding ruled-out letters.

Looking at the constraints:
- A is in position 4 (✓)
- Must contain L (not in position 2)
- Must contain E (not in positions 3 or 5)
- Cannot contain R, O, S, C, N

Possible positions for E: 1 or 2
Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 5

Let's try:
- E in 1, L in 3: E _ A L _
   - E _ A L _ : ""eclal"" - not a word, ""eclad"" - not a word, ""eclam"" - not a word, ""eclan"" - N is out, ""eclas"" - S is out, ""eclat"" - C is out, ""eblad"" - not a word, ""elead"" - not a word, ""eleva"" - not a word, ""elegal"" - too long
- E in 1, L in 5: E _ A _ L
   - E _ A _ L : ""eclal"" - C is out, ""eblal"" - not a word, ""eflal"" - not a word, ""emal"" - too short, ""epal"" - too short, ""eual"" - not a word
- E in 2, L in 3: _ E A L _
   - _ E A L _ : ""beal_"" - ""beals"" - S is out, ""deals"" - S is out, ""feals"" - not a word, ""heals"" - S is out, ""jeals"" - not a word, ""keals"" - not a word, ""leals"" - S is out, ""meals"" - S is out, ""peals"" - S is out, ""seals"" - S is out, ""teals"" - S is out
   - ""peal"" is 4 letters
   - ""cheal"" - C is out
   - ""sheal"" - S is out
   - ""leap"" - too short
   - ""mea"" - too short
- E in 2, L in 5: _ E A _ L
   - _ E A _ L : ""deeper"" - P is ok, but E is in 2, so D E E P E R - but E is repeated, and R is out
   - ""tread"" - R is out
   - ""bleed"" - E is in 3, which is invalid
   - ""cheel"" - C is out
   - ""sheel"" - S is out
   - ""peel"" - too short
   - ""melee"" - E is in 5, which is invalid
   - ""feeler"" - R is out
   - ""heeler"" - R is out
   - ""leeler"" - R is out
   - ""peeler"" - R is out
   - ""sheeler"" - R is out
   - ""zeeler"" - R is out

This is very restrictive. Let me try ""eagle"":
- E A L _ _ : ""eagle"" - E A L E G - but this has E in 1 and 4, but position 4 is A, so this doesn't fit. Wait, ""eagle"" is E A G L E, which would have A in position 2, but we know A is in position 4. So ""eagle"" is invalid.

Another word: ""eal"" is not a word. ""eaten"" - N is out.

This seems difficult. Maybe the word is ""legal"" but that's 5 letters: L E G A L - but A is in position 4, so this would be L E G A L - but that's 5 letters: positions 1=L, 2=E, 3=G, 4=A, 5=L. This uses L twice, but it's a valid word. Let's check constraints:
- A is in position 4 (✓)
- Contains L (positions 1 and 5) - ok, since L just can't be in position 2
- Contains E in position 2 - ok, since E can't be in 3 or 5
- Doesn't contain R, O, S, C, N
- Uses common letters G is ok

So ""legal"" seems to fit all constraints.

But let me double-check:
- From arose: A(-) - A is in word but not position 1
- From clean: A(✓) - A is in position 4
- So A is fixed at position 4
- From clean: L(-) - L is in word but not position 2
- From clean: E(-) - E is in word but not position 3
- From clean: E(-) again - E is in word but not position 3 (already known)
- From clean: A(✓) - A is in position 4
- From clean: N(x) - N not in word
- From arose: R(x), O(x), S(x) - these are out
- So letters allowed: A (fixed at 4), plus any not ruled out
- ""legal"" uses L, E, G, A, L - all allowed letters, and positions:
   1: L - allowed (not position 2)
   2: E - allowed (not position 3 or 5)
   3: G - allowed
   4: A - fixed
   5: L - allowed (not position 2)

This seems correct. I'll go with ""legal"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: clean -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) E(-) A(✓) N(x)
Guess 3: legal -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(✓) G(x) A(✓) L(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback on “legal” we now know:

- L is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 5 (because it showed “-” in both places).
- E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
- A is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4).
- L is also in the correct position (position 5) … but the feedback said “-” there, which contradicts that.

Wait, let’s parse the feedback carefully:

Guess 3: legal  
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   L E G A L  
Feedback:  -  ✓  x  ✓  -

So:
- Position 1: L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- Position 2: E(✓) → E is in the word AND correctly placed at position 2.
- Position 3: G(x) → G is NOT in the word.
- Position 4: A(✓) → A is in the word AND correctly placed at position 4.
- Position 5: L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Therefore:
- Word pattern: _ E _ A _
- Must contain L, but L cannot be in positions 1 or 5.
- Hence L must be in position 3.
- Letters ruled out so far: R, O, S, C, N, G
- Remaining letters to try: common consonants like D, H, M, P, T, etc.

So the word must be: _ E L A _

Possible 5-letter words fitting _ E L A _:
- B E L A ? → “belas” (plural of bela, not common)
- D E L A ? → “dela_” not a word
- F E L A ? → “fela_” not a word
- H E L A ? → “hela_” not a word
- M E L A ? → “mela_” not a word
- P E L A ? → “pe la_” not a word
- T E L A ? → “tele_” but needs 5 letters
- V E L A ? → “vela_” not a word
- W E L A ? → “wela_” not a word
- K E L A ? → “kela_” not a word
- Z E L A ? → “zela_” not a word

Wait, common word: “t e l a _” doesn’t fit. Let me think differently.

Actually, the pattern is _ E L A _ (positions 2=E, 3=L, 4=A). The only common English 5-letter word that fits is:

- T E L A _ → “telam” not a word
- P E L A _ → “pe la_” not a word
- B E L A _ → “belar” not a word
- D E L A _ → “delaq” not a word

Hmm, seems limited. Let me check if any other letter fits position 1 and 5 while keeping L in 3.

Actually, position 5 can be any letter not ruled out, and position 1 can be any letter not ruled out (not L, E, A).

Looking at common words: “_ e l a _” the only one that comes to mind is:

- “q e l a _” no
- “x e l a _” no
- “j e l a _” no
- “k e l a _” no
- “m e l a _” no
- “v e l a _” no

Wait, let me try “d e l a v” not a word.

Actually, the correct word must be “t e l a _” but I’m missing it. Let me think of words ending with a consonant after A.

The only common word I can find is “t e l a _” which doesn’t fit. Let me try “b e l a _” again.

Wait, let me step back: pattern _ E L A _ (positions 2=E, 3=L, 4=A). The only valid word is:

- “b e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “d e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “f e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “h e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “k e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “m e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “p e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “v e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “w e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “y e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “z e l a _” doesn’t fit

This suggests I might have made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback:

Guess 3: legal → L(-) E(✓) G(x) A(✓) L(✓)

The feedback symbols are for each position:

- Position 1: L(-) → L not in position 1
- Position 2: E(✓) → E is correctly placed at position 2
- Position 3: G(x) → G not in word
- Position 4: A(✓) → A is correctly placed at position 4
- Position 5: L(✓) → L is correctly placed at position 5

This is contradictory: earlier it said L is not in position 1 or 5, but now position 5 shows L as correct. This must be a misinterpretation.

Let me re-interpret the feedback for guess 3:

Guess 3: legal  
Letters: L(1) E(2) G(3) A(4) L(5)  
Feedback: -  ✓  x  ✓  -

So:
- L at position 1: (-) → L not in position 1
- E at position 2: (✓) → E is correctly placed at position 2
- G at position 3: (x) → G not in word
- A at position 4: (✓) → A is correctly placed at position 4
- L at position 5: (-) → L not in position 5

Therefore:
- Word pattern: _ E _ A _
- Must contain L, but L cannot be in positions 1 or 5
- Hence L must be in position 3
- So word must be: _ E L A _

Now, looking for 5-letter words _ E L A _:

- B E L A _ → “belas” (plural of bela, not standard)
- D E L A _ → “dela_” not a word
- F E L A _ → “fela_” not a word
- H E L A _ → “hela_” not a word
- K E L A _ → “kela_” not a word
- M E L A _ → “mela_” not a word
- P E L A _ → “pe la_” not a word
- T E L A _ → “telam” not a word
- V E L A _ → “vela_” not a word
- W E L A _ → “wela_” not a word
- Y E L A _ → “yela_” not a word
- Z E L A _ → “zela_” not a word

The only standard English word that fits is “t e l a _” which doesn’t complete. This suggests I might have missed a word.

Wait, the word “t e l a _” doesn’t exist. Let me try “b e l a _” again.

Actually, the correct word must be “t e l a _” but I’m not finding it. Let me try “b e l a _” one more time.

After careful reconsideration, the only valid word that fits _ E L A _ is:

- “b e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “d e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “f e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “h e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “k e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “m e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “p e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “v e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “w e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “y e l a _” doesn’t fit
- “z e l a _” doesn’t fit

This indicates I might have made an error in interpreting the feedback. Let me re-examine:

Guess 3: legal → L(-) E(✓) G(x) A(✓) L(✓)

The feedback symbols are for each letter in the guess, not positions. So:

- L is in the word but not at position 1 (because it showed (-) there)
- E is in the word and at position 2 (✓)
- G is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and at position 4 (✓)
- L is in the word and at position 5 (✓)

This is contradictory: it says L is at position 5 (✓), but also that L is in the word but not at position 1 (-). This implies L must be at position 5, which seems to be the case.

Therefore, the word must be: _ E _ A L

Now, the pattern is _ E _ A L, and we know:
- Letters not in word: R, O, S, C, N, G
- Must contain L (already placed at 5)
- Other letters to try: common consonants like B, D, F, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y, Z

Looking for _ E _ A L:
- B E _ A L → “behal” not a word
- D E _ A L → “deval” not a word
- F E _ A L → “fehal” not a word
- H E _ A L → “hehal” not a word
- K E _ A L → “kehal” not a word
- M E _ A L → “meval” not a word
- P E _ A L → “pehal” not a word
- T E _ A L → “teval” not a word
- V E _ A L → “vehal” not a word
- W E _ A L → “wehal” not a word
- Y E _ A L → “yehal” not a word
- Z E _ A L → “zehal” not a word

The only common word that fits is “t e m p l” but that’s not valid. After careful search, the correct word must be:

“d e m a l” → but A is at 4, so “d e m a l” is invalid.

Wait, the pattern is _ E _ A L. The only valid word is:

“d e m a l” → invalid
“f e m a l” → invalid
“h e m a l” → invalid
“k e m a l” → invalid
“m e m a l” → invalid
“p e m a l” → invalid
“t e m a l” → invalid
“v e m a l” → invalid
“w e m a l” → invalid
“y e m a l” → invalid
“z e m a l” → invalid

This is perplexing. Let me try a different approach: list all 5-letter words with A at position 4 and E at position 2, and see which fits the constraints.

Words with pattern _ E _ A _:
- b e g a m → but G is out
- b e d a m → not a word
- d e m a n → N is out
- f e m a c → C is out
- h e m a t → T is ok
- k e m a t → K is ok
- m e m a t → M is ok
- p e m a t → P is ok
- t e m a p → P is ok
- v e m a t → V is ok
- w e m a t → W is ok
- y e m a t → Y is ok
- z e m a t → Z is ok

The word “h e m a t” is valid: H E M A T (short for hematologist, but “hemato” is not 5 letters). Actually, the correct word is “h e m a t” → “hemal”?

Let me try “hemal”:
- H E M A L → fits _ E _ A L
- Letters: H, E, M, A, L
- E is at 2 (✓), A is at 4 (✓), L is at 5 (✓)
- H and M are new letters not ruled out
- M is not ruled out
- This seems valid.

Therefore, the next guess is “hemal”.Based on the latest feedback, the word must have:
- E in position 2
- A in position 4
- L in position 5
- No G, R, O, S, C, N

The only common 5-letter word fitting _ E _ A L is ""hemal"".

So ""bleed"" is invalid (E would be in 3).\n   - ""cheep"" - C is out\n   - ""sheer"" - S is out, R is out\n   - ""cheep"" - C is out\n   - ""peeler"" - P, E, E, L, R - R is out, E is repeated\n   - ""beeler"" - R is out\n   - ""heeler"" - R is out\n   - ""leerer"" - R is out\n   - ""peeler"" - R is out\n   - ""sheeler"" - R is out\n   - ""zeeler"" - R is out\n\nThis is tricky. Let me think of common 5-letter words with A in position 4, containing L and E, avoiding ruled-out letters.\n\nLooking at the constraints:\n- A is in position 4 (✓)\n- Must contain L (not in position 2)\n- Must contain E (not in positions 3 or 5)\n- Cannot contain R, O, S, C, N\n\nPossible positions for E: 1 or 2\nPossible positions for L: 1, 3, 5\n\nLet\'s try:\n- E in 1, L in 3: E _ A L _\n   - E _ A L _ : ""eclal"" - not a word, ""eclad"" - not a word, ""eclam"" - not a word, ""eclan"" - N is out, ""eclas"" - S is out, ""eclat"" - C is out, ""eblad"" - not a word, ""elead"" - not a word, ""eleva"" - not a word, ""elegal"" - too long\n- E in 1, L in 5: E _ A _ L\n   - E _ A _ L : ""eclal"" - C is out, ""eblal"" - not a word, ""eflal"" - not a word, ""emal"" - too short, ""epal"" - too short, ""eual"" - not a word\n- E in 2, L in 3: _ E A L _\n   - _ E A L _ : ""beal_"" - ""beals"" - S is out, ""deals"" - S is out, ""feals"" - not a word, ""heals"" - S is out, ""jeals"" - not a word, ""keals"" - not a word, ""leals"" - S is out, ""meals"" - S is out, ""peals"" - S is out, ""seals"" - S is out, ""teals"" - S is out\n   - ""peal"" is 4 letters\n   - ""cheal"" - C is out\n   - ""sheal"" - S is out\n   - ""leap"" - too short\n   - ""mea"" - too short\n- E in 2, L in 5: _ E A _ L\n   - _ E A _ L : ""deeper"" - P is ok, but E is in 2, so D E E P E R - but E is repeated, and R is out\n   - ""tread"" - R is out\n   - ""bleed"" - E is in 3, which is invalid\n   - ""cheel"" - C is out\n   - ""sheel"" - S is out\n   - ""peel"" - too short\n   - ""melee"" - E is in 5, which is invalid\n   - ""feeler"" - R is out\n   - ""heeler"" - R is out\n   - ""leeler"" - R is out\n   - ""peeler"" - R is out\n   - ""sheeler"" - R is out\n   - ""zeeler"" - R is out\n\nThis is very restrictive. Let me try ""eagle"":\n- E A L _ _ : ""eagle"" - E A L E G - but this has E in 1 and 4, but position 4 is A, so this doesn\'t fit. Wait, ""eagle"" is E A G L E, which would have A in position 2, but we know A is in position 4. So ""eagle"" is invalid.\n\nAnother word: ""eal"" is not a word. ""eaten"" - N is out.\n\nThis seems difficult. Maybe the word is ""legal"" but that\'s 5 letters: L E G A L - but A is in position 4, so this would be L E G A L - but that\'s 5 letters: positions 1=L, 2=E, 3=G, 4=A, 5=L. This uses L twice, but it\'s a valid word. Let\'s check constraints:\n- A is in position 4 (✓)\n- Contains L (positions 1 and 5) - ok, since L just can\'t be in position 2\n- Contains E in position 2 - ok, since E can\'t be in 3 or 5\n- Doesn\'t contain R, O, S, C, N\n- Uses common letters G is ok\n\nSo ""legal"" seems to fit all constraints.\n\nBut let me double-check:\n- From arose: A(-) - A is in word but not position 1\n- From clean: A(✓) - A is in position 4\n- So A is fixed at position 4\n- From clean: L(-) - L is in word but not position 2\n- From clean: E(-) - E is in word but not position 3\n- From clean: E(-) again - E is in word but not position 3 (already known)\n- From clean: A(✓) - A is in position 4\n- From clean: N(x) - N not in word\n- From arose: R(x), O(x), S(x) - these are out\n- So letters allowed: A (fixed at 4), plus any not ruled out\n- ""legal"" uses L, E, G, A, L - all allowed letters, and positions:\n   1: L - allowed (not position 2)\n   2: E - allowed (not position 3 or 5)\n   3: G - allowed\n   4: A - fixed\n   5: L - allowed (not position 2)\n\nThis seems correct.

Let me try “b e l a _” again.\n\nWait, let me step back: pattern _ E L A _ (positions 2=E, 3=L, 4=A). The only valid word is:\n\n- “b e l a _” doesn’t fit\n- “d e l a _” doesn’t fit\n- “f e l a _” doesn’t fit\n- “h e l a _” doesn’t fit\n- “k e l a _” doesn’t fit\n- “m e l a _” doesn’t fit\n- “p e l a _” doesn’t fit\n- “v e l a _” doesn’t fit\n- “w e l a _” doesn’t fit\n- “y e l a _” doesn’t fit\n- “z e l a _” doesn’t fit\n\nThis suggests I might have made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback:\n\nGuess 3: legal → L(-) E(✓) G(x) A(✓) L(✓)\n\nThe feedback symbols are for each position:\n\n- Position 1: L(-) → L not in position 1\n- Position 2: E(✓) → E is correctly placed at position 2\n- Position 3: G(x) → G not in word\n- Position 4: A(✓) → A is correctly placed at position 4\n- Position 5: L(✓) → L is correctly placed at position 5\n\nThis is contradictory: earlier it said L is not in position 1 or 5, but now position 5 shows L as correct.

Let me try “b e l a _” one more time.\n\nAfter careful reconsideration, the only valid word that fits _ E L A _ is:\n\n- “b e l a _” doesn’t fit\n- “d e l a _” doesn’t fit\n- “f e l a _” doesn’t fit\n- “h e l a _” doesn’t fit\n- “k e l a _” doesn’t fit\n- “m e l a _” doesn’t fit\n- “p e l a _” doesn’t fit\n- “v e l a _” doesn’t fit\n- “w e l a _” doesn’t fit\n- “y e l a _” doesn’t fit\n- “z e l a _” doesn’t fit\n\nThis indicates I might have made an error in interpreting the feedback. Let me re-examine:\n\nGuess 3: legal → L(-) E(✓) G(x) A(✓) L(✓)\n\nThe feedback symbols are for each letter in the guess, not positions. So:\n\n- L is in the word but not at position 1 (because it showed (-) there)\n- E is in the word and at position 2 (✓)\n- G is not in the word (x)\n- A is in the word and at position 4 (✓)\n- L is in the word and at position 5 (✓)\n\nThis is contradictory: it says L is at position 5 (✓), but also that L is in the word but not at position 1 (-). This implies L must be at position 5, which seems to be the case.\n\nTherefore, the word must be: _ E _ A L\n\nNow, the pattern is _ E _ A L, and we know:\n- Letters not in word: R, O, S, C, N, G\n- Must contain L (already placed at 5)\n- Other letters to try: common consonants like B, D, F, H, K, M, P, T, V, W, Y, Z\n\nLooking for _ E _ A L:\n- B E _ A L → “behal” not a word\n- D E _ A L → “deval” not a word\n- F E _ A L → “fehal” not a word\n- H E _ A L → “hehal” not a word\n- K E _ A L → “kehal” not a word\n- M E _ A L → “meval” not a word\n- P E _ A L → “pehal” not a word\n- T E _ A L → “teval” not a word\n- V E _ A L → “vehal” not a word\n- W E _ A L → “wehal” not a word\n- Y E _ A L → “yehal” not a word\n- Z E _ A L → “zehal” not a word\n\nThe only common word that fits is “t e m p l” but that’s not valid. After careful search, the correct word must be:\n\n“d e m a l” → but A is at 4, so “d e m a l” is invalid.\n\nWait, the pattern is _ E _ A L. The only valid word is:\n\n“d e m a l” → invalid\n“f e m a l” → invalid\n“h e m a l” → invalid\n“k e m a l” → invalid\n“m e m a l” → invalid\n“p e m a l” → invalid\n“t e m a l” → invalid\n“v e m a l” → invalid\n“w e m a l” → invalid\n“y e m a l” → invalid\n“z e m a l” → invalid\n\nThis is perplexing. Let me try a different approach: list all 5-letter words with A at position 4 and E at position 2, and see which fits the constraints.\n\nWords with pattern _ E _ A _:\n- b e g a m → but G is out\n- b e d a m → not a word\n- d e m a n → N is out\n- f e m a c → C is out\n- h e m a t → T is ok\n- k e m a t → K is ok\n- m e m a t → M is ok\n- p e m a t → P is ok\n- t e m a p → P is ok\n- v e m a t → V is ok\n- w e m a t → W is ok\n- y e m a t → Y is ok\n- z e m a t → Z is ok\n\nThe word “h e m a t” is valid: H E M A T (short for hematologist, but “hemato” is not 5 letters). Actually, the correct word is “h e m a t” → “hemal”?\n\nLet me try “hemal”:\n- H E M A L → fits _ E _ A L\n- Letters: H, E, M, A, L\n- E is at 2 (✓), A is at 4 (✓), L is at 5 (✓)\n- H and M are new letters not ruled out\n- M is not ruled out\n- This seems valid.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is “hemal”.Based on the latest feedback, the word must have:\n- E in position 2\n- A in position 4\n- L in position 5\n- No G, R, O, S, C, N\n\nThe only common 5-letter word fitting _ E _ A L is ""hemal"".\n\n<guess>hemal</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: clean -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) E(-) A(✓) N(x)\nGuess 3: legal -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(✓) G(x) A(✓) L(✓)\nGuess 4: hemal -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(✓) M(-) A(✓) L(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the latest feedback on “hemal”:

- M(-) → M is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- A(✓) → A is correctly placed in position 4.
- L(✓) → L is correctly placed in position 5.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ E _ A L
- Must contain M, but M cannot be in position 3.
- Cannot contain: R, O, S, C, N, G, H
- Letters still possible for positions 1 and 3: any not ruled out (not H, G, N, etc.)

Position 3 must be M (the only remaining place M can be, since it cannot be in position 3 and must be in word). So the word is _ E M A L.

Looking for 5-letter words ending in “emal”:
- “smal” → not a word

- Actually, the only standard word ending in “emal” is “smal” (not valid) or “emal” itself, but “emal” is not a word.

Wait, let me think differently: the word must be _ E M A L. The only common word fitting is:

- “t” + “emal” → “temal” not a word
- “b” + “emal” → “bemal” not a word
- “d” + “emal” → “demal” not a word
- “f” + “emal” → “femal” not a word
- “k” + “emal” → “kemal” not a word
- “v” + “emal” → “vemal” not a word
- “w” + “emal” → “wemal” not a word
- “y” + “emal” → “yemal” not a word

After careful reconsideration, the only valid English 5-letter word ending in “emal” is “smal” (not valid) or “emal” itself (not valid). This suggests I might have missed a word.

However, the word “t” + “emal” does not exist. Let me try “d” + “emal” → “demal” not a word.

Upon reflection, the correct word must be “t” + “emal” which is invalid. This indicates an error in my previous steps.

Let me re-examine the pattern: _ E _ A L with M somewhere. Since M cannot be in position 3, and must be in word, the only remaining positions are 1 or 3. But position 3 is not allowed, so M must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be M E _ A L. Now looking for _ E _ A L with M in position 1:

- M E _ A L → “media” but A is at 4
- “media” is invalid (A is 4, but word is M E D I A)
- Actually, the word must be M E D A L → but D is allowed.

The word “medal” fits:
- M E D A L
- Pattern: _ E _ A L with M in 1, D in 3
- Letters: M, E, D, A, L
- E is at 2 (✓), A is at 4 (✓), L is at 5 (✓)
- M is at 1 (allowed, since M(-) only said M not at 3)
- D is a new letter not ruled out
- This is a valid word.

Therefore, the next guess is “medal”.
