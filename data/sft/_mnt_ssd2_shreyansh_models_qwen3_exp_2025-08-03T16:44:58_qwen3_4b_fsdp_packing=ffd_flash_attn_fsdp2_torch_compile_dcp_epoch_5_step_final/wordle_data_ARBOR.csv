For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
1. It contains 3 of the most common vowels (A, O, E)
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. These letters appear in many 5-letter words

This should give us good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word and in the correct first position.
- R is in the word and in the correct second position.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (so O is not in position 3).
- S and E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
1. Pattern: A R _ _ _
2. Letters definitely in the word: A, R, O
3. Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, E
4. O cannot be in position 3, so it must be in position 4 or 5.

Next guess should:
- Keep A and R fixed in positions 1 and 2.
- Try O in position 4 or 5.
- Use other common letters (T, N, L, I, etc.) for the remaining blanks.

Trying O in position 4: A R _ O _
Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, D, M, etc.
Trying A R T O _ : but we need a 5-letter word. ""ARTLY"" isn't valid. ""ARTOC"" isn't a word. ""AROMA"" is a word but uses O twice which might not be allowed.

Trying O in position 5: A R _ _ O
Possible words: A R T I O (not a word), A R I Z O (not a word), A R L O W (not a word), A N G E O (but E is excluded).

Wait, let's think of valid 5-letter words:
- A R O W _ : but O is in position 3 which is invalid (O cannot be in position 3).
- A R _ O _ : possible words: A R T O _ (none), A R I O _ (none), A R M O _ (none).
- A R _ _ O : possible words: A R T I O (not valid), A R I Z O (not valid), A R L O W (not valid), A N G O _ (but G is possible).

Actually, ""ANGER"" is invalid (E is excluded). ""ARN"" is too short.

Let me think differently: we know A, R, O are in the word, positions 1, 2, and somewhere else. O can't be in position 3, so possible positions for O are 4 or 5.

Let's try O in position 4: A R _ O _
We need two more letters. Common letters left: T, N, I, L, D, M, etc.
Possible combinations:
- A R T O _ : need a 5th letter. ""ARTON"" isn't a word. ""ARTOL"" isn't a word.
- A R I O _ : ""ARION"" is a word (though ARION is not common).

Trying O in position 5: A R _ _ O
Possible words:
- A R T I O (not valid)
- A R I N O (not valid)
- A R M I O (not valid)
- A N G E O (but E is excluded)
- A R M O R (but R is already used in position 2, and double letters might be allowed, but ""ARMOR"" is a word)

""ARMOR"" is a valid word:
- A (✓) in position 1
- R (✓) in position 2
- O in position 4 (valid since O can't be in position 3)
- M and O are new letters to test

This seems like the best next guess.
</think>

Based on the feedback from ""arose"", we know:
- A and R are locked in positions 1 and 2.
- O must appear somewhere other than position 3 (it was marked ""-"" in position 3, meaning it's in the word but not there).
- S and E are not in the word.

A good next step is to test O in position 4 and introduce new common consonants. The word ""ARMOR"" fits:
- Keeps A and R in positions 1 and 2.
- Puts O in position 4 (valid since O can't be in position 3).
- Introduces M and another R to test for double letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern so far: A R _ O R
   - A, R, O, R are all locked into positions 1, 2, 4, 5.

2. Letters already ruled out: S, E, M.

3. Only position 3 is still unknown.  
   We need a letter for position 3 that:
   - has not been used yet,
   - is not S, E, M,
   - is not A, R, O, R (they’re already placed).

Common unused consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for a valid 5-letter word that matches A R _ O R, the most common fillers are:
- A R I O R  → not a valid word.
- A R G O R  → “ARGOR” is not a standard word.
- A R D O R  → “ARDOR” is valid and uses D, which hasn’t been tested.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
1. It contains 3 of the most common vowels (A, O, E)
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. These letters appear in many 5-letter words

This should give us good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word and in the correct first position.
- R is in the word and in the correct second position.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (so O is not in position 3).
- S and E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
1. Pattern: A R _ _ _
2. Letters definitely in the word: A, R, O
3. Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, E
4. O cannot be in position 3, so it must be in position 4 or 5.

Next guess should:
- Keep A and R fixed in positions 1 and 2.
- Try O in position 4 or 5.
- Use other common letters (T, N, L, I, etc.) for the remaining blanks.

Trying O in position 4: A R _ O _
Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, D, M, etc.
Trying A R T O _ : but we need a 5-letter word. ""ARTLY"" isn't valid. ""ARTOC"" isn't a word. ""AROMA"" is a word but uses O twice which might not be allowed.

Trying O in position 5: A R _ _ O
Possible words: A R T I O (not a word), A R I Z O (not a word), A R L O W (not a word), A N G E O (but E is excluded).

Wait, let's think of valid 5-letter words:
- A R O W _ : but O is in position 3 which is invalid (O cannot be in position 3).
- A R _ O _ : possible words: A R T O _ (none), A R I O _ (none), A R M O _ (none).
- A R _ _ O : possible words: A R T I O (not valid), A R I Z O (not valid), A R L O W (not valid), A N G O _ (but G is possible).

Actually, ""ANGER"" is invalid (E is excluded). ""ARN"" is too short.

Let me think differently: we know A, R, O are in the word, positions 1, 2, and somewhere else. O can't be in position 3, so possible positions for O are 4 or 5.

Let's try O in position 4: A R _ O _
We need two more letters. Common letters left: T, N, I, L, D, M, etc.
Possible combinations:
- A R T O _ : need a 5th letter. ""ARTON"" isn't a word. ""ARTOL"" isn't a word.
- A R I O _ : ""ARION"" is a word (though ARION is not common).

Trying O in position 5: A R _ _ O
Possible words:
- A R T I O (not valid)
- A R I N O (not valid)
- A R M I O (not valid)
- A N G E O (but E is excluded)
- A R M O R (but R is already used in position 2, and double letters might be allowed, but ""ARMOR"" is a word)

""ARMOR"" is a valid word:
- A (✓) in position 1
- R (✓) in position 2
- O in position 4 (valid since O can't be in position 3)
- M and O are new letters to test

This seems like the best next guess.Based on the feedback from ""arose"", we know:
- A and R are locked in positions 1 and 2.
- O must appear somewhere other than position 3 (it was marked ""-"" in position 3, meaning it's in the word but not there).
- S and E are not in the word.

A good next step is to test O in position 4 and introduce new common consonants. The word ""ARMOR"" fits:
- Keeps A and R in positions 1 and 2.
- Puts O in position 4 (valid since O can't be in position 3).
- Introduces M and another R to test for double letters.
