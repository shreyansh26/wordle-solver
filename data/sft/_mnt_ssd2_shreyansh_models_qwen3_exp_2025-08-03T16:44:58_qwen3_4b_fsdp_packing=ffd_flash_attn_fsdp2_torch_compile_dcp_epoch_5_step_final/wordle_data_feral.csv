### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible.

One such word is ""RAISE"" - it contains R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters. This should give us good feedback on several high-frequency letters in the secret word.

From the two guesses so far:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
   - R, A, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively.
   - I, S are not in the word.

2. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, R, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively (same as before).
   - O, S are not in the word. (S was already known not to be in the word from RAISE, so this just confirms it.)

So we know:
- Must have R, A, E somewhere in the word (each appears exactly once).
- Must not have I, S, O.

We have three confirmed letters (R, A, E) and two unconfirmed letters (they must be from the remaining alphabet excluding I, S, O, and the letters already used or ruled out).

Looking at the positions:
- R cannot be in position 1 or 2 (from RAISE and AROSE feedback).
- A cannot be in position 1 or 2 (from RAISE and AROSE feedback).
- E cannot be in position 5 (from RAISE and AROSE feedback).

I need a word with R, A, E and two new letters (let's call them X and Y) such that:
- R is in positions 3, 4, or 5
- A is in positions 3, 4, or 5
- E is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

Possible positions for R, A, E:
- E could be in 1, 2, 3, or 4
- A could be in 3, 4, or 5
- R could be in 3, 4, or 5

Let's try to place them:
Option 1: E in position 1
- E _ _ _ _
- A could be in 3, 4, or 5
- R could be in 3, 4, or 5
- Need two new letters (X and Y) for the remaining spots.

Option 2: E in position 2
- _ E _ _ _
- A could be in 3, 4, or 5
- R could be in 3, 4, or 5

Option 3: E in position 3
- _ _ E _ _
- A could be in 4 or 5
- R could be in 4 or 5

Option 4: E in position 4
- _ _ _ E _
- A could be in 3 or 5
- R could be in 3 or 5

Option 5: E in position 5 (invalid, since E cannot be in position 5)

Let's explore Option 1: E in position 1
- E _ _ _ _
- A could be in 3, 4, or 5
- R could be in 3, 4, or 5
- Need two new letters (X and Y) for the remaining spots.

Possible combinations:
- E A R X Y
- E A X R Y
- E A X Y R
- E R A X Y
- E R X A Y
- E R X Y A
- E X A R Y
- E X R A Y
- E X R Y A
- E X Y A R
- E X Y R A
- E Y A R X
- etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words with E, A, R and two new letters, avoiding S, I, O.

Some candidates:
- EARTH (but T isn't confirmed yet)
- EAGER (but G isn't confirmed yet)
- EARLY (but L and Y are new)
- EARNY (but N and Y are new)
- EATEN (but T and N are new)
- EAVES (but S is ruled out)
- ELDER (but L and D are new)
- ELENA (but L and N are new, and E is repeated - not allowed)
- EMERAL (but M and L are new)
- ENAGER (but N and G are new)

Let's pick ""EARLY"" - it has E, A, R, L, Y. All letters are allowed (no I, S, O), and it places:
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (but A cannot be in position 2 - from RAISE feedback, A(-) means it's not in position 2) - so this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""EARTH"" - E, A, R, T, H
- E in 1 (allowed)
- A in 2 (invalid - same as above)
- R in 3 (allowed)
- T and H are new letters

Invalid because A is in position 2.

Next candidate: ""EAGER"" - E, A, G, E, R - but E is repeated, which is not allowed (words in Wordle don't have repeated letters unless the secret word does).

Next candidate: ""EATEN"" - E, A, T, E, N - again E is repeated.

Next candidate: ""EAVES"" - S is ruled out.

Next candidate: ""ELDER"" - E, L, D, E, R - E is repeated.

Next candidate: ""EMERAL"" - too long.

Next candidate: ""ELECT"" - but O is ruled out (no O here), but this has E, L, E, C, T - E is repeated.

Hmm, seems like many words with E in position 1 have A in position 2, which is invalid. Let's try E in position 2.

Option 2: E in position 2
- _ E _ _ _
- A could be in 3, 4, or 5
- R could be in 3, 4, or 5
- Need two new letters for the remaining spots.

Possible combinations:
- X E A R Y
- X E A Y R
- X E R A Y
- X E R Y A
- X E Y A R
- X E Y R A
- Y E A R X
- Y E A X R
- Y E R A X
- Y E R X A
- Y E X A R
- Y E X R A

Looking for common words:
- ""YEAR"" is 4 letters
- ""CREPE"" - but P and C are new, but E is in position 2
- ""PRECE"" - but E is in position 2
- ""TREED"" - but E is in position 2
- ""BREAD"" - but E is in position 2
- ""CREED"" - but E is in position 2
- ""DELAY"" - but E is in position 2
- ""MEDIA"" - but E is in position 2
- ""MEDIA"" - but A is in position 5, which is allowed (from RAISE, A(-) means not in position 2, so 5 is allowed)
- ""MEDIA"" - letters M, E, D, I, A - but I is ruled out.

Next candidate: ""DELAY"" - D, E, L, A, Y
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- A in position 4 (allowed)
- R is not in this word - but we know R must be in the word (from RAISE feedback), so this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""CREPE"" - C, R, E, P, E - E is repeated.

Next candidate: ""TREED"" - T, R, E, E, D - E is repeated.

Next candidate: ""BREAD"" - B, R, E, A, D
- E in position 3 - but we're in option 2 where E is in position 2 - so this is invalid.

Wait, let's focus on option 2: E in position 2
- _ E _ _ _
- Need R and A in positions 3,4,5
- Need two new letters for the remaining spots.

Possible word: ""PERCH"" - but P, C, H are new, but missing A and R
- ""PARED"" - P, A, R, E, D - E is in position 4 - but we're in option 2 where E is in position 2 - so invalid.

This seems tricky. Let's try E in position 3.

Option 3: E in position 3
- _ _ E _ _
- A could be in 4 or 5 (since A(-) from RAISE means not in position 2, and from AROSE means not in position 1)
- R could be in 4 or 5 (since R(-) from RAISE means not in position 1, and from AROSE means not in position 2)
- Need two new letters for positions 1, 2, 4, 5 but only two positions are determined (3 is E)

Wait, the word structure is:
- pos1, pos2, pos3=E, pos4, pos5
- We know A and R must be in pos4 or pos5, but A cannot be in pos5 because from RAISE, A(-) means not in position 2, and from AROSE, A(-) means not in position 1, but pos5 is allowed for A (since RAISE had A in position 2, and AROSE had A in position 1, so A could be in 3,4,5 - but 3 is E, so 4 or 5)
- Similarly, R must be in pos4 or pos5 (since R(-) from RAISE means not in 1, and from AROSE means not in 2)
- So we have:
  - pos1 and pos2 must be new letters (not I, S, O, and not A, R, E)
  - pos4 and pos5 must be A and R in some order, or one of them could be A or R and the other a new letter, but we have to use both A and R somewhere.

But we have to use A and R exactly once each, and E is already in position 3.

So possible combinations:
- pos1 and pos2: new letters (from remaining alphabet excluding A, R, E, I, S, O)
- pos4 and pos5: must contain A and R in some order

Possible new letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let's try to find a word with:
- E in position 3
- A and R in positions 4 and 5 (order to be determined)
- Two new letters in positions 1 and 2

Possible candidates:
- B C E A R → ""BCEAR"" - not a word
- B L E A R → ""BLEAR"" - not a word
- C L E A R → ""CLEAR"" - this is a valid word!

""CLEAR"":
- C, L, E, A, R
- E in position 3 (allowed)
- A in position 4 (allowed - not in 1,2,5)
- R in position 5 (allowed - not in 1,2)
- C and L are new letters (not I, S, O, A, R, E)
- No repeated letters
- Valid English word

This seems to fit all constraints.

Let's verify:
- R is in the word (✓ from RAISE feedback)
- A is in the word (✓ from RAISE feedback)
- E is in the word (✓ from RAISE feedback)
- I and S are not in the word (✓)
- Positions:
  - R is in position 5 (not 1 or 2 - ✓)
  - A is in position 4 (not 1,2,5 - ✓)
  - E is in position 3 (not 1,2,5 - ✓)
- New letters C and L are used (no duplicates)

Therefore, ""CLEAR"" is a valid next guess.
</think>

<guess>CLEAR</guess>",CLEAR,"From the two guesses so far:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
   - R, A, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively.
   - I, S are not in the word.

2. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, R, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively (same as before).
   - O, S are not in the word. (S was already known not to be in the word from RAISE, so this just confirms it.)

So we know:
- Must have R, A, E somewhere in the word (each appears exactly once).
- Must not have I, S, O.

We have three confirmed letters (R, A, E) and two unconfirmed letters (they must be from the remaining alphabet excluding I, S, O, and the letters already used or ruled out).

Looking at the positions:
- R cannot be in position 1 or 2 (from RAISE and AROSE feedback).
- A cannot be in position 1 or 2 (from RAISE and AROSE feedback).
- E cannot be in position 5 (from RAISE and AROSE feedback).

I need a word with R, A, E and two new letters (let's call them X and Y) such that:
- R is in positions 3, 4, or 5
- A is in positions 3, 4, or 5
- E is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

Possible positions for R, A, E:
- E could be in 1, 2, 3, or 4
- A could be in 3, 4, or 5
- R could be in 3, 4, or 5

Let's try to place them:
Option 1: E in position 1
- E _ _ _ _
- A could be in 3, 4, or 5
- R could be in 3, 4, or 5
- Need two new letters (X and Y) for the remaining spots.

Option 2: E in position 2
- _ E _ _ _
- A could be in 3, 4, or 5
- R could be in 3, 4, or 5

Option 3: E in position 3
- _ _ E _ _
- A could be in 4 or 5
- R could be in 4 or 5

Option 4: E in position 4
- _ _ _ E _
- A could be in 3 or 5
- R could be in 3 or 5

Option 5: E in position 5 (invalid, since E cannot be in position 5)

Let's explore Option 1: E in position 1
- E _ _ _ _
- A could be in 3, 4, or 5
- R could be in 3, 4, or 5
- Need two new letters (X and Y) for the remaining spots.

Possible combinations:
- E A R X Y
- E A X R Y
- E A X Y R
- E R A X Y
- E R X A Y
- E R X Y A
- E X A R Y
- E X R A Y
- E X R Y A
- E X Y A R
- E X Y R A
- E Y A R X
- etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words with E, A, R and two new letters, avoiding S, I, O.

Some candidates:
- EARTH (but T isn't confirmed yet)
- EAGER (but G isn't confirmed yet)
- EARLY (but L and Y are new)
- EARNY (but N and Y are new)
- EATEN (but T and N are new)
- EAVES (but S is ruled out)
- ELDER (but L and D are new)
- ELENA (but L and N are new, and E is repeated - not allowed)
- EMERAL (but M and L are new)
- ENAGER (but N and G are new)

Let's pick ""EARLY"" - it has E, A, R, L, Y. All letters are allowed (no I, S, O), and it places:
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (but A cannot be in position 2 - from RAISE feedback, A(-) means it's not in position 2) - so this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""EARTH"" - E, A, R, T, H
- E in 1 (allowed)
- A in 2 (invalid - same as above)
- R in 3 (allowed)
- T and H are new letters

Invalid because A is in position 2.

Next candidate: ""EAGER"" - E, A, G, E, R - but E is repeated, which is not allowed (words in Wordle don't have repeated letters unless the secret word does).

Next candidate: ""EATEN"" - E, A, T, E, N - again E is repeated.

Next candidate: ""EAVES"" - S is ruled out.

Next candidate: ""ELDER"" - E, L, D, E, R - E is repeated.

Next candidate: ""EMERAL"" - too long.

Next candidate: ""ELECT"" - but O is ruled out (no O here), but this has E, L, E, C, T - E is repeated.

Hmm, seems like many words with E in position 1 have A in position 2, which is invalid. Let's try E in position 2.

Option 2: E in position 2
- _ E _ _ _
- A could be in 3, 4, or 5
- R could be in 3, 4, or 5
- Need two new letters for the remaining spots.

Possible combinations:
- X E A R Y
- X E A Y R
- X E R A Y
- X E R Y A
- X E Y A R
- X E Y R A
- Y E A R X
- Y E A X R
- Y E R A X
- Y E R X A
- Y E X A R
- Y E X R A

Looking for common words:
- ""YEAR"" is 4 letters
- ""CREPE"" - but P and C are new, but E is in position 2
- ""PRECE"" - but E is in position 2
- ""TREED"" - but E is in position 2
- ""BREAD"" - but E is in position 2
- ""CREED"" - but E is in position 2
- ""DELAY"" - but E is in position 2
- ""MEDIA"" - but E is in position 2
- ""MEDIA"" - but A is in position 5, which is allowed (from RAISE, A(-) means not in position 2, so 5 is allowed)
- ""MEDIA"" - letters M, E, D, I, A - but I is ruled out.

Next candidate: ""DELAY"" - D, E, L, A, Y
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- A in position 4 (allowed)
- R is not in this word - but we know R must be in the word (from RAISE feedback), so this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""CREPE"" - C, R, E, P, E - E is repeated.

Next candidate: ""TREED"" - T, R, E, E, D - E is repeated.

Next candidate: ""BREAD"" - B, R, E, A, D
- E in position 3 - but we're in option 2 where E is in position 2 - so this is invalid.

Wait, let's focus on option 2: E in position 2
- _ E _ _ _
- Need R and A in positions 3,4,5
- Need two new letters for the remaining spots.

Possible word: ""PERCH"" - but P, C, H are new, but missing A and R
- ""PARED"" - P, A, R, E, D - E is in position 4 - but we're in option 2 where E is in position 2 - so invalid.

This seems tricky. Let's try E in position 3.

Option 3: E in position 3
- _ _ E _ _
- A could be in 4 or 5 (since A(-) from RAISE means not in position 2, and from AROSE means not in position 1)
- R could be in 4 or 5 (since R(-) from RAISE means not in position 1, and from AROSE means not in position 2)
- Need two new letters for positions 1, 2, 4, 5 but only two positions are determined (3 is E)

Wait, the word structure is:
- pos1, pos2, pos3=E, pos4, pos5
- We know A and R must be in pos4 or pos5, but A cannot be in pos5 because from RAISE, A(-) means not in position 2, and from AROSE, A(-) means not in position 1, but pos5 is allowed for A (since RAISE had A in position 2, and AROSE had A in position 1, so A could be in 3,4,5 - but 3 is E, so 4 or 5)
- Similarly, R must be in pos4 or pos5 (since R(-) from RAISE means not in 1, and from AROSE means not in 2)
- So we have:
  - pos1 and pos2 must be new letters (not I, S, O, and not A, R, E)
  - pos4 and pos5 must be A and R in some order, or one of them could be A or R and the other a new letter, but we have to use both A and R somewhere.

But we have to use A and R exactly once each, and E is already in position 3.

So possible combinations:
- pos1 and pos2: new letters (from remaining alphabet excluding A, R, E, I, S, O)
- pos4 and pos5: must contain A and R in some order

Possible new letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let's try to find a word with:
- E in position 3
- A and R in positions 4 and 5 (order to be determined)
- Two new letters in positions 1 and 2

Possible candidates:
- B C E A R → ""BCEAR"" - not a word
- B L E A R → ""BLEAR"" - not a word
- C L E A R → ""CLEAR"" - this is a valid word!

""CLEAR"":
- C, L, E, A, R
- E in position 3 (allowed)
- A in position 4 (allowed - not in 1,2,5)
- R in position 5 (allowed - not in 1,2)
- C and L are new letters (not I, S, O, A, R, E)
- No repeated letters
- Valid English word

This seems to fit all constraints.

Let's verify:
- R is in the word (✓ from RAISE feedback)
- A is in the word (✓ from RAISE feedback)
- E is in the word (✓ from RAISE feedback)
- I and S are not in the word (✓)
- Positions:
  - R is in position 5 (not 1 or 2 - ✓)
  - A is in position 4 (not 1,2,5 - ✓)
  - E is in position 3 (not 1,2,5 - ✓)
- New letters C and L are used (no duplicates)

Therefore, ""CLEAR"" is a valid next guess.",Guess 3: CLEAR -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) E(-) A(✓) R(-),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible.

One such word is ""RAISE"" - it contains R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters. This should give us good feedback on several high-frequency letters in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 1
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 2
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- Letters that must appear somewhere: R, A, E
- Letters that definitely don’t appear: I, S
- Positions to avoid for those letters:
  - R cannot be in position 1
  - A cannot be in position 2
  - E cannot be in position 5

I want a new guess that:
1. Includes R, A, E (since they’re confirmed)
2. Doesn’t use I or S
3. Places R, A, E in new positions (avoiding the forbidden spots mentioned above)
4. Uses common letters for the remaining two slots

A good candidate is “AROSE”:
- Contains A, R, E (all confirmed letters)
- Doesn’t use I or S
- Positions:
  - A in position 1 (allowed, since forbidden was position 2)
  - R in position 2 (allowed, forbidden was position 1)
  - E in position 4 (allowed, forbidden was position 5)
- Uses common letters O and T (though T isn’t confirmed yet)

This should give us more information about the correct placement of A, R, E and test new letters O and T.

From the two guesses so far:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
   - R, A, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively.
   - I, S are not in the word.

Let’s digest the new feedback from CLEAR:

C(x) → C is NOT in the word  
L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 2  
E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 3  
A(✓) → A is in the word AND in position 4 (fixed)  
R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 5  

Summary of what we now know:
- Letters that ARE in the word: A (locked at position 4), L, E, R  
- Letters that are NOT in the word: I, S, O, C (plus any already ruled out)  
- Forbidden positions:
  – A is in position 4 only (so no other A)  
  – L cannot be in position 2  
  – E cannot be in position 3  
  – R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 5 (from earlier and new feedback)  

Hence R must be in position 3 or 4, but position 4 is already A, so R must be in position 3.

So we have:
Position 1: ?  
Position 2: ? (cannot be L)  
Position 3: R  
Position 4: A  
Position 5: ?  

Letters still to place: L and E (each once) plus one more new letter (since we have five positions and already have A, R, E, L; the fifth must be a new letter not yet used).

Possible new letters (not yet tried and not ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need:
- E to be placed somewhere it is allowed (not position 3, and not position 5 because R is already there). So E must be in position 1 or 2.  
- L to be placed somewhere it is allowed (not position 2, and not position 3, 4, 5 because R, A are already placed). So L must be in position 1 or 5.  
- One more new letter to fill the remaining spot.

Let’s list valid placements:

Case 1: E in position 1  
Then we have: E _ R A _  
L must go in position 5 (since position 2 is forbidden for L)  
So word form: E _ R A L  
Need a new letter for position 2 (cannot be any of A, R, E, L, and preferably common).  
Possible: E B R A L → “EBRAL” (not a word)  
Possible: E D R A L → “EDRAL” (not a word)  
Possible: E G R A L → “EGRAL” (not a word)  
… scan common English: “EGRAL” etc. don’t exist.

Case 2: E in position 2  
Then we have: _ E R A _  
L must go in position 5 (since position 1 is open but L is not allowed in 2, and 3,4,5 are taken or forbidden).  
So word form: _ E R A L  
Need a new letter for position 1.  
Possible: B E R A L → “BERAL” (not a word)  
D E R A L → “DERAL” (not a word)  
F E R A L → “FERAL” (this IS a valid English word!)  
Check constraints:  
- F not yet used or ruled out  
- E in position 2 (allowed)  
- R in position 3 (allowed)  
- A in position 4 (locked)  
- L in position 5 (allowed)  
- No duplicates or ruled-out letters.

Thus “FERAL” satisfies every constraint.
