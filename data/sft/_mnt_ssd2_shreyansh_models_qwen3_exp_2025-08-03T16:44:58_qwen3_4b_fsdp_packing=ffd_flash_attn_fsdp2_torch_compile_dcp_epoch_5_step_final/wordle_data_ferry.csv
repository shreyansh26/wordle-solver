2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in 5-letter words
2. It has 2 common consonants (R, S) in positions that might help reveal the correct placement
3. It avoids less common letters that might waste guesses

This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, but not A, O, or S.
- R is not in the 2nd position.
- E is not in the 5th position.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and E (since they’re confirmed in the word)
2. Doesn’t contain A, O, or S (since they’re marked x)
3. Has R in a different position (not 2nd)
4. Has E in a different position (not 5th)

Good letters to try next: T, N, L, C, D, H, etc.  
I’ll try a word that places R and E in new positions while introducing other common consonants.  
A good candidate is ""TREAD"":
- T: new letter, common
- R: confirmed in word, now in 2nd position (was in 2nd last time, so this is a new position)
- E: confirmed in word, now in 3rd position (was in 5th last time, so this is new)
- A: already ruled out (x), so avoid
- D: new letter, common

But wait, A is not in TREAD, so that’s fine.  
However, R is still in the 2nd position, which was the same as last time, and we know R is in the wrong position.  
Let me choose a word where R is not in 2nd place.

Another candidate: ""ENTER"":
- E: in 1st position (was in 5th last time, so new)
- N: new letter
- T: new letter
- E: in 4th position (but we already know E is in the word somewhere; this might not be optimal)
- R: in 5th position (was in 2nd last time, so new position)

But ""ENTER"" has E twice, which might not be efficient.  
Better to spread out the letters.

Alternative: ""CRETE"":
- C: new letter
- R: in 2nd position (same as last time, which was wrong position 2) → not good

Another option: ""TREND"":
- T: new
- R: 2nd position (same as last time) → not good

Better: ""DRIER"":
- D: new
- R: 1st position (new)
- I: new
- E: 4th position (new)
- R: 5th position (new)

But this repeats R, which is okay, but might not help much.

Best so far: ""TREAD"" is okay, but let’s avoid R in 2nd.  
Alternative: ""ENTRY"":
- E: 1st (new)
- N: new
- T: new
- R: 4th (new)
- Y: new

This seems good: introduces new letters and places R and E in new positions.

But let me check if there’s a more optimal first guess based on standard Wordle strategies.  
Common follow-up guesses after AROSE: ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", etc., but they may not be optimal.

Actually, a better follow-up is ""CRANE"":
- C: new
- R: 2nd (same as before) → not good

Alternative: ""TIMER"":
- T: new
- I: new
- M: new
- E: 4th (new)
- R: 5th (new)

This seems good: all new letters except E and R, and positions for E and R are different.

But ""TIMER"" has E in 4th, which is new (was in 5th last time), and R in 5th (was in 2nd last time).  
This is an improvement.

Final choice: ""TIMER""
</think>

Based on the feedback that R and E are in the word but in wrong positions, I’ll try a new word that places R and E in different positions while introducing fresh common letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in 5-letter words
2. It has 2 common consonants (R, S) in positions that might help reveal the correct placement
3. It avoids less common letters that might waste guesses

This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The secret word contains R and E, but not A, O, or S.
- R is not in the 2nd position.
- E is not in the 5th position.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and E (since they’re confirmed in the word)
2. Doesn’t contain A, O, or S (since they’re marked x)
3. Has R in a different position (not 2nd)
4. Has E in a different position (not 5th)

Good letters to try next: T, N, L, C, D, H, etc.  
I’ll try a word that places R and E in new positions while introducing other common consonants.  
A good candidate is ""TREAD"":
- T: new letter, common
- R: confirmed in word, now in 2nd position (was in 2nd last time, so this is a new position)
- E: confirmed in word, now in 3rd position (was in 5th last time, so this is new)
- A: already ruled out (x), so avoid
- D: new letter, common

But wait, A is not in TREAD, so that’s fine.  
However, R is still in the 2nd position, which was the same as last time, and we know R is in the wrong position.  
Let me choose a word where R is not in 2nd place.

Another candidate: ""ENTER"":
- E: in 1st position (was in 5th last time, so new)
- N: new letter
- T: new letter
- E: in 4th position (but we already know E is in the word somewhere; this might not be optimal)
- R: in 5th position (was in 2nd last time, so new position)

But ""ENTER"" has E twice, which might not be efficient.  
Better to spread out the letters.

Alternative: ""CRETE"":
- C: new letter
- R: in 2nd position (same as last time, which was wrong position 2) → not good

Another option: ""TREND"":
- T: new
- R: 2nd position (same as last time) → not good

Better: ""DRIER"":
- D: new
- R: 1st position (new)
- I: new
- E: 4th position (new)
- R: 5th position (new)

But this repeats R, which is okay, but might not help much.

Best so far: ""TREAD"" is okay, but let’s avoid R in 2nd.  
Alternative: ""ENTRY"":
- E: 1st (new)
- N: new
- T: new
- R: 4th (new)
- Y: new

This seems good: introduces new letters and places R and E in new positions.

But let me check if there’s a more optimal first guess based on standard Wordle strategies.  
Common follow-up guesses after AROSE: ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", etc., but they may not be optimal.

Actually, a better follow-up is ""CRANE"":
- C: new
- R: 2nd (same as before) → not good

Alternative: ""TIMER"":
- T: new
- I: new
- M: new
- E: 4th (new)
- R: 5th (new)

This seems good: all new letters except E and R, and positions for E and R are different.

But ""TIMER"" has E in 4th, which is new (was in 5th last time), and R in 5th (was in 2nd last time).  
This is an improvement.

Final choice: ""TIMER""Based on the feedback that R and E are in the word but in wrong positions, I’ll try a new word that places R and E in different positions while introducing fresh common letters.
