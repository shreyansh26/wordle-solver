### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good starting word should use distinct common letters. ""AROSE"" is often recommended as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This gives us good coverage to test multiple letters at once.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more balanced.

I'll proceed with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

We know:
- E is in the correct position (5th spot).
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ _ E

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, H, M, B, F, G, K, Y, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.

I’ll pick a word that uses several of these. Some good candidates:
- TIGER – but contains R (invalid).
- UNITY – ends with Y (invalid).
- CHUTE – ends with E and uses C, H, U, T (all valid letters not yet ruled out).

""CHUTE"" seems like a strong next guess.

We now know:
1. The word ends with “E” (5th letter is E).
2. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, C, H, U, T, M, D, G.
3. Letter I is in the word and in the correct position (2nd spot).

So the pattern is: _ I _ _ E  
Available letters (from the remaining alphabet) include: B, F, J, K, L, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in the 2nd position.
- Has E in the 5th position.
- Uses only the allowed letters for the 1st, 3rd, and 4th positions.

Candidate words:
- BIBLE – B, I, B, L, E → B is allowed, L is allowed. (Valid word.)
- FIBRE – R is invalid.
- PIVOT – O, T invalid.
- VIGOR – O, R, G invalid.
- JIGEE – J, I, G, E, E → G invalid.
- KILOE – K, I, L, O, E → O invalid.
- LIEGE – L, I, E, J, G → G invalid.
- NIECE – N, I, E, C, E → C invalid.
- WIELD – D invalid.
- FILET – T invalid.
- VILET – T invalid.
- BIBLE** seems the only valid word fitting all constraints.

Let me double-check:
- BIBLE: B, I, B, L, E.
  - B: allowed (not in the forbidden list).
  - I: confirmed in 2nd position.
  - B: allowed.
  - L: allowed.
  - E: confirmed in 5th position.
  - No forbidden letters used.

Therefore, BIBLE is a valid next guess.
