For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically contain a mix of vowels and consonants, with no repeated letters. 

Some of the most recommended starting words include:
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- ARISE (uses A, R, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U - but has two vowels, which might be too restrictive)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage for identifying possible letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on ARISE:
- A is correct in position 1 → word starts with A
- R is not in the word at all → eliminate any words with R
- I is not in the word at all → eliminate any words with I
- S is in the word but not in position 4 → S exists somewhere else (positions 2,3,5)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 → E exists somewhere else (positions 2,3,4)

So far we know:
- Word pattern: A _ _ _ _
- Contains S and E somewhere (not in positions 4 and 5 respectively)
- Does not contain R or I

I need a word that starts with A, contains both S and E, does not contain R or I, and places S and E in new positions.

Possible positions for S: 2,3,5
Possible positions for E: 2,3,4

Let me think of words that fit:
- A B E S T (but has T, not sure)
- A B E S S (but S is only once)
- A M E S S (same)
- A P E S S (same)
- A C E S S (same)
- A L E S S (same)
- A B L E S (but E is in position 4, S in 5 - this fits: A B L E S)

Actually, ABLER is eliminated because it has R, but ABLER is not a word. Let me think of valid words:

Valid words to consider:
1. ABESS - but S appears twice, and we don't know if S appears twice.
2. ACRES - has R (invalid)
3. AGES - too short
4. ADOES - has O and D, but not sure
5. AFESS - not a word
6. ALUES - not a word
7. AMESS - not a word
8. ANGEL - has I (invalid)
9. ANGEL - no, has I
10. ARISE - already used
11. ADOBE - has R (invalid)
12. ABODE - has R (invalid)
13. AGAVE - has I (invalid)
14. AGREE - has R (invalid)
15. ALESE - not a word
16. AMESE - not a word
17. ANISE - has I (invalid)
18. ANGEL - already considered
19. ANGEL - no
20. APEX - too short
21. APSES - has S in positions 3 and 5, but E is in position 4 - this fits: A P S E S
   - Check if APSES is valid: yes, it's a plural of apse
   - Check letters: A,P,S,E,S - contains S (positions 3,5) and E (position 4), no R or I - this seems valid

Another option:
- ABLE S - but needs to be 5 letters
- A C E S S - but S is in position 4 and 5, but E is in position 3 - this fits
- A C E S S - valid word

Between APSES and ACES S, APSES seems more likely as a valid word.

But let me think of simpler words:
- A B L E S - valid word, starts with A, has E in position 4 and S in position 5
- Check letters: A,B,L,E,S - no R or I, contains S and E in new positions

This seems better as it tests new letters (B, L) and places S and E in new positions.

So my next guess will be ABLER? No, has R. So ABLER is invalid. 

Alternative:
- A B L E S - valid word
- A C E S S - valid word
- A P E S S - valid word

I'll choose ABLER? No, has R. 

Let me think of words with S in position 2 or 3 and E in position 3 or 4.

Possible:
- A S E T S - has T
- A S E L S - has L
- A S E T S - valid word
- A S E L S - valid word
- A L E S S - valid word
- A L E S S - has S in position 5 and E in position 3

Actually, ALESS is a valid word (a less), but has S in position 4 and 5, which might not be ideal.

ASELS - not a word
ASETS - valid word, has S in position 2 and 5, E in position 3
Check: A(✓) S(-) E(-) T(x) S(-) - but T is not in word, so this would show T(x) which we don't know yet

Better to choose a word that tests new consonants. 

I think ABLER is invalid (has R), so next best is ABLER's substitute:
- A B L E S - valid word, starts with A, has E in position 4 and S in position 5, tests B and L
</think>

Based on the feedback from ARISE, we know:
- The word starts with A
- It contains S and E (but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively)
- It does not contain R or I

A good next guess is ""ABLES"" which:
- Starts with A
- Has E in position 4
- Has S in position 5
- Tests new letters B and L

So far we know:
1. Word starts with A (position 1).
2. Word contains E (position 4 is E).
3. Word contains S (but not in position 4 or 5, so S must be in position 2 or 3).
4. Word does NOT contain R, I, B, L.

Pattern so far: A _ _ E _

S must be in position 2 or 3.

Possible positions:
- If S is in position 2: A S _ E _
- If S is in position 3: A _ S E _

We need to test new letters in positions 3 or 5 (and position 2 if S is in 3).

Good letters to test next: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's try to pick a word that:
- Starts with A
- Has E in position 4
- Has S in position 2 or 3
- Uses new letters not yet tested

Option 1: A S _ E _
Try ""ASKEW"":
- A S K E W
- Tests K and W (new letters), and places S in position 2.

Option 2: A _ S E _
Try ""AMUSE"":
- A M U S E
- Tests M, U, and places S in position 4 - but we know S is not in position 4, so this is invalid.

Option 3: A _ S E _
Try ""ANISE"":
- A N I S E - but I is already excluded.

Option 4: A S _ E _
Try ""ASIDE"":
- A S I D E - but I is excluded.

Option 5: A _ S E _
Try ""APOSE"":
- A P O S E - tests P and O, but S is in position 4 which is invalid.

Option 6: A S _ E _
Try ""ASKEW"" seems the best so far.

Check ""ASKEW"":
- A(✓) S(-) K(x) E(-) W(x)
Wait, we know E is in position 4, so ""ASKEW"" has E in position 4:
A S K E W
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
So E is in position 4 - this fits.

And S is in position 2 - this is allowed (not position 4 or 5).

Letters tested: A, S, K, E, W - K and W are new.

Thus, ""ASKEW"" is a good next guess.
