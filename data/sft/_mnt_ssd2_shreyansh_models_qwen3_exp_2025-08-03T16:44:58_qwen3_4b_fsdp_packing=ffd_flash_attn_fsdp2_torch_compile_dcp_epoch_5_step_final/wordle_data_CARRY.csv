For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information I can get. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible.

One such word is ""RAISE"" - it contains R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters. This should give me good coverage for my first guess.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 1).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (currently in position 2).
- I, S, E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Word must be _ A _ _ _
- Contains R somewhere other than position 1.
- Does not contain I, S, E.

Good letters to try next include O, U, T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc. Since R must be somewhere after position 2 (because it’s not in position 1), a good candidate is a word like “CARTY” but that’s not valid. Instead, let’s try “CARTO” – but again, not valid. A valid word that fits is “CARTY” but not valid. Another valid word is “MARRY” but that has two R’s which might not be optimal.

A better approach is to try a word that places R in position 3, 4, or 5 and continues testing other common letters. “MADAM” is invalid. “CABER” – but E is already ruled out. “BARON” – but O is in, and we don’t know about O yet. However, from RAISE we know E is out, but O wasn’t tested.

Wait, let’s pick a word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Places R in a new position (not 1).
- Tests new common letters.

A good choice is “BARON”:
- B, O, R, N are all new letters.
- R is in position 3, which is new for R.
- A is in position 2, which matches the known correct position.

This seems optimal.

So far we know:

2. Has R in position 3.
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
4. Uses fresh letters to gain new information.

Candidate letters left: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A quick scan for common 5-letter words matching “_ A R _ _” gives “CARGO” (invalid – O is out), “DARMA” (invalid – M and D are okay, but A is already known in position 2), “FARCE” (E is out), “GAROT” (O, T maybe okay), “HARPY” (P, Y okay), “LARKY” (L, K, Y okay), “MARRY” (M, Y okay), “PARTY” (P, T, Y okay), “TARRY” (T, Y okay), “HARDY” (H, D, Y okay).

The simplest common word among these is “HARDY” – it keeps A and R fixed, tests H, D, Y which are all new.

From the feedback so far:

1. Pattern: _ A R _ Y  (A in pos 2, R in pos 3, Y in pos 5 are locked)
2. Eliminated letters: I, S, E, B, O, N, H, D
3. Still usable letters (not yet tested): C, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with any letter except those eliminated.
- Must contain A, R, Y in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively.
- Must use only letters not yet eliminated.

Looking for common words that fit _ A R _ Y:

- CARRY – C and Y are okay, but Y is already known in position 5, so this would be C A R R Y – but R is already in position 3, and we don’t know if R can appear twice. Also, the second R would be in position 4, which hasn’t been ruled out yet. However, CARRY is a valid word.
- FARRY – F and Y, but Y is fixed at position 5, so F A R R Y – same as above with F.
- LARRY – L and Y, but again Y is fixed at position 5.

But we don’t know if repeated letters are allowed or if R can appear twice. The simplest assumption is that letters can repeat unless ruled out.

However, looking for words with _ A R _ Y and no repeated letters (since we want to test new letters), we have:

- CARRY – C and R (R is already in position 3, but the second R is in position 4, which hasn’t been ruled out. The letter R itself hasn’t been ruled out for position 4, only position 1 was ruled out for R in the first guess. So R could be in position 4.)
- FARRY – F and R (same logic)
- LARRY – L and R (same logic)

But we also need to test other letters. Let’s look for words with different starting letters:

- MARRY – M and R (but Y is fixed at position 5, so M A R R Y – again R in position 4 is allowed)
- TARRY – T and R (same)

But we’re looking for the simplest next guess that fits the pattern and tests new letters. The most straightforward word that fits _ A R _ Y and uses new letters is “CARRY” – it tests C and R (R is allowed in position 4).

However, another valid word is “FARRY” – but F is a new letter and R is allowed in position 4.

But the simplest common word among these is “CARRY”.

Wait, let’s double-check:

- CARRY: C (new), A (known), R (known in position 3), R (new position 4), Y (known in position 5). This is valid.
- FARRY: F (new), A, R, R, Y – valid.
- MARRY: M (new), A, R, R, Y – valid.

But we don’t know if R can be in position 4. The only rule is that R is in the word somewhere (from first feedback), and in BARON it was in position 3, so position 4 is not ruled out.

The most straightforward guess that tests a new common letter is “CARRY”.

But let’s also consider that we might want to test other letters. Another valid word is “MARRY” – but M is a new letter.

Actually, let’s look for words with _ A R _ Y and no repeated letters except what’s necessary. The word “CARRY” has two R’s, which might not be optimal if we want to test new letters.

Another option is “FARRY” – but again two R’s.

The word “LARRY” also has two R’s.

The word “TARRY” has two R’s.

The word “MARRY” has two R’s.

The word “CARRY” has two R’s.

The word “PARRY” – P and R (second R in position 4), Y in position 5 – valid.

But we’re looking for the simplest next guess. Among these, “CARRY” is the most common word.

However, another valid word is “FERRY” – but E is eliminated.

The word “GARRY” – G and R (second R), Y – valid.

But again, the most common is “CARRY”.

But let’s think differently: we have _ A R _ Y, and we need to fill positions 1 and 4 with letters not yet eliminated.

Eliminated letters: I, S, E, B, O, N, H, D.

Available letters: C, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a word with _ A R _ Y where the first and fourth letters are from the available letters.

Possible combinations:

- C A R T Y – but T is available, Y is fixed at position 5. So C A R T Y – but this would be C A R T Y, but position 4 is T, and position 5 is Y. So C A R T Y – but this is C A R T Y, which is a valid word.

Wait, let’s list valid words:

- CARRY – C A R R Y
- FARRY – F A R R Y
- LARRY – L A R R Y
- MARRY – M A R R Y
- PARRY – P A R R Y
- TARRY – T A R R Y
- GARRY – G A R R Y

But these all have two R’s. We might want to avoid repeated R’s to test more letters.

Looking for words with _ A R _ Y and only one R (position 3), and other letters new:

- C A R T Y – C A R T Y – but this has R in position 3 and T in position 4, Y in position 5. This is C A R T Y – valid word.

Similarly:

- F A R T Y – but is “FARTY” a word? Not common.
- L A R T Y – “LARTY” not a word.
- M A R T Y – “MARTY” is a name, but not sure if valid.
- P A R T Y – “PARTY” is valid.
- T A R T Y – “TARTY” not common.

The word “CARTY” is not valid.

The word “CARRY” is valid but has two R’s.

The word “PARTY” is valid and has P in position 1, A, R in position 3, T in position 4, Y in position 5. This uses P and T, both new letters.

This seems optimal.

Therefore, the next guess should be PARTY.

Based on the pattern _ A R _ Y and the letters still available, the most logical next guess is PARTY.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information I can get. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible.

One such word is ""RAISE"" - it contains R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters. This should give me good coverage for my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 1).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (currently in position 2).
- I, S, E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Word must be _ A _ _ _
- Contains R somewhere other than position 1.
- Does not contain I, S, E.

Good letters to try next include O, U, T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc. Since R must be somewhere after position 2 (because it’s not in position 1), a good candidate is a word like “CARTY” but that’s not valid. Instead, let’s try “CARTO” – but again, not valid. A valid word that fits is “CARTY” but not valid. Another valid word is “MARRY” but that has two R’s which might not be optimal.

A better approach is to try a word that places R in position 3, 4, or 5 and continues testing other common letters. “MADAM” is invalid. “CABER” – but E is already ruled out. “BARON” – but O is in, and we don’t know about O yet. However, from RAISE we know E is out, but O wasn’t tested.

Wait, let’s pick a word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Places R in a new position (not 1).
- Tests new common letters.

A good choice is “BARON”:
- B, O, R, N are all new letters.
- R is in position 3, which is new for R.
- A is in position 2, which matches the known correct position.

This seems optimal.

3. Still usable letters (not yet tested): C, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with any letter except those eliminated.
- Must contain A, R, Y in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively.
- Must use only letters not yet eliminated.

Looking for common words that fit _ A R _ Y:

- CARRY – C and Y are okay, but Y is already known in position 5, so this would be C A R R Y – but R is already in position 3, and we don’t know if R can appear twice. Also, the second R would be in position 4, which hasn’t been ruled out yet. However, CARRY is a valid word.
- FARRY – F and Y, but Y is fixed at position 5, so F A R R Y – same as above with F.
- LARRY – L and Y, but again Y is fixed at position 5.

But we don’t know if repeated letters are allowed or if R can appear twice. The simplest assumption is that letters can repeat unless ruled out.

However, looking for words with _ A R _ Y and no repeated letters (since we want to test new letters), we have:

- CARRY – C and R (R is already in position 3, but the second R is in position 4, which hasn’t been ruled out. The letter R itself hasn’t been ruled out for position 4, only position 1 was ruled out for R in the first guess. So R could be in position 4.)
- FARRY – F and R (same logic)
- LARRY – L and R (same logic)

But we also need to test other letters. Let’s look for words with different starting letters:

- MARRY – M and R (but Y is fixed at position 5, so M A R R Y – again R in position 4 is allowed)
- TARRY – T and R (same)

But we’re looking for the simplest next guess that fits the pattern and tests new letters. The most straightforward word that fits _ A R _ Y and uses new letters is “CARRY” – it tests C and R (R is allowed in position 4).

However, another valid word is “FARRY” – but F is a new letter and R is allowed in position 4.

But the simplest common word among these is “CARRY”.

Wait, let’s double-check:

- CARRY: C (new), A (known), R (known in position 3), R (new position 4), Y (known in position 5). This is valid.
- FARRY: F (new), A, R, R, Y – valid.
- MARRY: M (new), A, R, R, Y – valid.

But we don’t know if R can be in position 4. The only rule is that R is in the word somewhere (from first feedback), and in BARON it was in position 3, so position 4 is not ruled out.

The most straightforward guess that tests a new common letter is “CARRY”.

But let’s also consider that we might want to test other letters. Another valid word is “MARRY” – but M is a new letter.

Actually, let’s look for words with _ A R _ Y and no repeated letters except what’s necessary. The word “CARRY” has two R’s, which might not be optimal if we want to test new letters.

Another option is “FARRY” – but again two R’s.

The word “LARRY” also has two R’s.

The word “TARRY” has two R’s.

The word “MARRY” has two R’s.

The word “CARRY” has two R’s.

The word “PARRY” – P and R (second R in position 4), Y in position 5 – valid.

But we’re looking for the simplest next guess. Among these, “CARRY” is the most common word.

However, another valid word is “FERRY” – but E is eliminated.

The word “GARRY” – G and R (second R), Y – valid.

But again, the most common is “CARRY”.

But let’s think differently: we have _ A R _ Y, and we need to fill positions 1 and 4 with letters not yet eliminated.

Eliminated letters: I, S, E, B, O, N, H, D.

Available letters: C, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a word with _ A R _ Y where the first and fourth letters are from the available letters.

Possible combinations:

- C A R T Y – but T is available, Y is fixed at position 5. So C A R T Y – but this would be C A R T Y, but position 4 is T, and position 5 is Y. So C A R T Y – but this is C A R T Y, which is a valid word.

Wait, let’s list valid words:

- CARRY – C A R R Y
- FARRY – F A R R Y
- LARRY – L A R R Y
- MARRY – M A R R Y
- PARRY – P A R R Y
- TARRY – T A R R Y
- GARRY – G A R R Y

But these all have two R’s. We might want to avoid repeated R’s to test more letters.

Looking for words with _ A R _ Y and only one R (position 3), and other letters new:

- C A R T Y – C A R T Y – but this has R in position 3 and T in position 4, Y in position 5. This is C A R T Y – valid word.

Similarly:

- F A R T Y – but is “FARTY” a word? Not common.
- L A R T Y – “LARTY” not a word.
- M A R T Y – “MARTY” is a name, but not sure if valid.
- P A R T Y – “PARTY” is valid.
- T A R T Y – “TARTY” not common.

The word “CARTY” is not valid.

The word “CARRY” is valid but has two R’s.

The word “PARTY” is valid and has P in position 1, A, R in position 3, T in position 4, Y in position 5. This uses P and T, both new letters.

This seems optimal.

Therefore, the next guess should be PARTY.Based on the pattern _ A R _ Y and the letters still available, the most logical next guess is PARTY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information I can get. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible.

One such word is ""RAISE"" - it contains R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters. This should give me good coverage for my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 1).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (currently in position 2).
- I, S, E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Word must be _ A _ _ _
- Contains R somewhere other than position 1.
- Does not contain I, S, E.

Good letters to try next include O, U, T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc. Since R must be somewhere after position 2 (because it’s not in position 1), a good candidate is a word like “CARTY” but that’s not valid. Instead, let’s try “CARTO” – but again, not valid. A valid word that fits is “CARTY” but not valid. Another valid word is “MARRY” but that has two R’s which might not be optimal.

A better approach is to try a word that places R in position 3, 4, or 5 and continues testing other common letters. “MADAM” is invalid. “CABER” – but E is already ruled out. “BARON” – but O is in, and we don’t know about O yet. However, from RAISE we know E is out, but O wasn’t tested.

Wait, let’s pick a word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Places R in a new position (not 1).
- Tests new common letters.

A good choice is “BARON”:
- B, O, R, N are all new letters.
- R is in position 3, which is new for R.
- A is in position 2, which matches the known correct position.

This seems optimal.

3. Still usable letters (not yet tested): C, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with any letter except those eliminated.
- Must contain A, R, Y in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively.
- Must use only letters not yet eliminated.

Looking for common words that fit _ A R _ Y:

- CARRY – C and Y are okay, but Y is already known in position 5, so this would be C A R R Y – but R is already in position 3, and we don’t know if R can appear twice. Also, the second R would be in position 4, which hasn’t been ruled out yet. However, CARRY is a valid word.
- FARRY – F and Y, but Y is fixed at position 5, so F A R R Y – same as above with F.
- LARRY – L and Y, but again Y is fixed at position 5.

But we don’t know if repeated letters are allowed or if R can appear twice. The simplest assumption is that letters can repeat unless ruled out.

However, looking for words with _ A R _ Y and no repeated letters (since we want to test new letters), we have:

- CARRY – C and R (R is already in position 3, but the second R is in position 4, which hasn’t been ruled out. The letter R itself hasn’t been ruled out for position 4, only position 1 was ruled out for R in the first guess. So R could be in position 4.)
- FARRY – F and R (same logic)
- LARRY – L and R (same logic)

But we also need to test other letters. Let’s look for words with different starting letters:

- MARRY – M and R (but Y is fixed at position 5, so M A R R Y – again R in position 4 is allowed)
- TARRY – T and R (same)

But we’re looking for the simplest next guess that fits the pattern and tests new letters. The most straightforward word that fits _ A R _ Y and uses new letters is “CARRY” – it tests C and R (R is allowed in position 4).

However, another valid word is “FARRY” – but F is a new letter and R is allowed in position 4.

But the simplest common word among these is “CARRY”.

Wait, let’s double-check:

- CARRY: C (new), A (known), R (known in position 3), R (new position 4), Y (known in position 5). This is valid.
- FARRY: F (new), A, R, R, Y – valid.
- MARRY: M (new), A, R, R, Y – valid.

But we don’t know if R can be in position 4. The only rule is that R is in the word somewhere (from first feedback), and in BARON it was in position 3, so position 4 is not ruled out.

The most straightforward guess that tests a new common letter is “CARRY”.

But let’s also consider that we might want to test other letters. Another valid word is “MARRY” – but M is a new letter.

Actually, let’s look for words with _ A R _ Y and no repeated letters except what’s necessary. The word “CARRY” has two R’s, which might not be optimal if we want to test new letters.

Another option is “FARRY” – but again two R’s.

The word “LARRY” also has two R’s.

The word “TARRY” has two R’s.

The word “MARRY” has two R’s.

The word “CARRY” has two R’s.

The word “PARRY” – P and R (second R in position 4), Y in position 5 – valid.

But we’re looking for the simplest next guess. Among these, “CARRY” is the most common word.

However, another valid word is “FERRY” – but E is eliminated.

The word “GARRY” – G and R (second R), Y – valid.

But again, the most common is “CARRY”.

But let’s think differently: we have _ A R _ Y, and we need to fill positions 1 and 4 with letters not yet eliminated.

Eliminated letters: I, S, E, B, O, N, H, D.

Available letters: C, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a word with _ A R _ Y where the first and fourth letters are from the available letters.

Possible combinations:

- C A R T Y – but T is available, Y is fixed at position 5. So C A R T Y – but this would be C A R T Y, but position 4 is T, and position 5 is Y. So C A R T Y – but this is C A R T Y, which is a valid word.

Wait, let’s list valid words:

- CARRY – C A R R Y
- FARRY – F A R R Y
- LARRY – L A R R Y
- MARRY – M A R R Y
- PARRY – P A R R Y
- TARRY – T A R R Y
- GARRY – G A R R Y

But these all have two R’s. We might want to avoid repeated R’s to test more letters.

Looking for words with _ A R _ Y and only one R (position 3), and other letters new:

- C A R T Y – C A R T Y – but this has R in position 3 and T in position 4, Y in position 5. This is C A R T Y – valid word.

Similarly:

- F A R T Y – but is “FARTY” a word? Not common.
- L A R T Y – “LARTY” not a word.
- M A R T Y – “MARTY” is a name, but not sure if valid.
- P A R T Y – “PARTY” is valid.
- T A R T Y – “TARTY” not common.

The word “CARTY” is not valid.

The word “CARRY” is valid but has two R’s.

The word “PARTY” is valid and has P in position 1, A, R in position 3, T in position 4, Y in position 5. This uses P and T, both new letters.

This seems optimal.

Therefore, the next guess should be PARTY.Based on the pattern _ A R _ Y and the letters still available, the most logical next guess is PARTY.

We now know the exact positions of A, R, and Y:

Pattern: _ A R _ Y

Letters already eliminated:  
I, S, E, B, O, N, H, D, P, T

Still usable letters (not yet tested):  
C, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a five-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 2, R in position 3, Y in position 5.
2. Uses only letters from the still-usable set.
3. Uses fresh letters in positions 1 and 4 to gain maximum information.

Scanning common English words matching _ A R _ Y:

- C A R V Y – not a valid word.
- F A R C Y – not valid.
- G A R B Y – but B is eliminated.
- K A R V Y – not valid.
- L A R V Y – not valid.
- M A R V Y – not valid.
- F A R M Y – but M is usable, F is usable.  
  F A R M Y → “FARMY” is not a recognized word.
- C A R V Y – still not valid.
- G A R V Y – not valid.
- L A R G Y – but G is usable, L is usable.  
  L A R G Y → “LARGY” is not a common word.
- M A R C Y – but C is usable, M is usable.  
  M A R C Y → “MARCY” is not standard.
- C A R M Y – “CARMY” not valid.
- F A R L Y – “FARLY” not valid.
- L A R M Y – “LARMY” not valid.
- M A R F Y – “MARFY” not valid.
- C A R F Y – “CARFY” not valid.
- G A R F Y – “GARFY” not valid.
- L A R F Y – “LARFY” not valid.
- M A R G Y – “MARGY” is a diminutive but not a standard word.
- C A R G Y – “CARGY” not valid.
- F A R C Y – again not valid.
- L A R C Y – “LARCY” not valid.

The only remaining common word that fits is:

- M A R C Y – but again not standard.

Wait, let’s double-check the dictionary:

Common valid words with pattern * A R * Y:

- CARRY – C, R, Y already used positions.
- FARRY – F, R, Y – but F is new.
- LARRY – L, R, Y – but L is new.
- MARRY – M, R, Y – but M is new.
- PARRY – P is eliminated.
- TARRY – T is eliminated.

The word “FARRY” is valid and fits:

F A R R Y  
- F is new (position 1).  
- R is allowed in position 4 (only position 1 was eliminated for R).  
- Y is fixed in position 5.

This is the only straightforward common word left that satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, the next logical guess is FARRY.
