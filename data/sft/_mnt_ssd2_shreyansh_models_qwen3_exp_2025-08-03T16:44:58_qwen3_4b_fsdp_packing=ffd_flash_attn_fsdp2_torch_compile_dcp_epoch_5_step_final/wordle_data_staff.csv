For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) in different positions. This will help me quickly identify which of these key letters are in the secret word and their correct positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) → S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word must contain A and S.
2. It must not contain R, O, or E.
3. A is somewhere other than position 1.
4. S is somewhere other than position 4.

Letters we can rule out: R, O, E.
Letters we still need to test: A (but we already know it's present), S (also known to be present), plus any others not yet tried.

To maximize information, I should pick a word that:
- Keeps A and S but moves them to new positions.
- Introduces several new common letters not yet tested.
- Avoids R, O, E.

Good new letters to test: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

A good candidate is ""STAID"":
- Contains S and A, but in different positions (S in position 1, A in position 2).
- Tests T, I, D, none of which were in AROSE.
- Avoids R, O, E.

Another candidate could be ""SALTY"", but T and Y weren't tested yet. ""STAID"" seems slightly better as it tests three new letters (T, I, D) while moving S and A.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) in different positions. This will help me quickly identify which of these key letters are in the secret word and their correct positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) → S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word must contain A and S.
2. It must not contain R, O, or E.
3. A is somewhere other than position 1.
4. S is somewhere other than position 4.

Letters we can rule out: R, O, E.
Letters we still need to test: A (but we already know it's present), S (also known to be present), plus any others not yet tried.

To maximize information, I should pick a word that:
- Keeps A and S but moves them to new positions.
- Introduces several new common letters not yet tested.
- Avoids R, O, E.

Good new letters to test: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

A good candidate is ""STAID"":
- Contains S and A, but in different positions (S in position 1, A in position 2).
- Tests T, I, D, none of which were in AROSE.
- Avoids R, O, E.

Another candidate could be ""SALTY"", but T and Y weren't tested yet. ""STAID"" seems slightly better as it tests three new letters (T, I, D) while moving S and A.

I'll go with ""STAID"".

We now have two rounds of feedback.

Round 1: arose  
A(-)  R(x)  O(x)  S(-)  E(x)  
→ A and S are in the word but not in positions 1 and 4, respectively; R, O, E are not present.

Round 2: staid  
S(✓)  T(✓)  A(✓)  I(x)  D(x)  
→ S is in position 1, T is in position 2, A is in position 3; I and D are not in the word.

So we know:
- Exact pattern: S T A _ _
- Letters already placed: S (1), T (2), A (3).
- Letters already ruled out: R, O, E, I, D.
- Still need to find positions 4 and 5.
- Remaining unused common letters not yet eliminated: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with “STA” and uses only letters not yet eliminated.  
Let’s list some possibilities quickly:
- STABY – uses B, Y (both still possible)
- STACH – not a valid word
- STAMP – uses M, P (both still possible)
- STANK – uses N, K (both still possible)
- STAND – uses N, D but D is eliminated
- STARK – uses K (possible), but R is eliminated
- STASH – uses H (possible), but H not yet tested
- STAYS – uses Y (possible), but A is already used in position 3

Among these, “STANK” and “STAMP” look promising.  
“STANK” tests K and N.  
“STAMP” tests M and P.

Either could be correct, but I’ll pick one to test.  
Let’s try “STANK” first.

(If I had to choose one based on letter frequency, N and K are common enough to test together.)

Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: staid -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) A(✓) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>

We now have two rounds of feedback.

Round 1: arose  
A(-)  R(x)  O(x)  S(-)  E(x)  
→ A and S are in the word but not in positions 1 and 4, respectively; R, O, E are not present.

Round 2: staid  
S(✓)  T(✓)  A(✓)  I(x)  D(x)  
→ S is in position 1, T is in position 2, A is in position 3; I and D are not in the word.

So we know:
- Exact pattern: S T A _ _
- Letters already placed: S (1), T (2), A (3).
- Letters already ruled out: R, O, E, I, D.
- Still need to find positions 4 and 5.
- Remaining unused common letters not yet eliminated: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with “STA” and uses only letters not yet eliminated.  
Let’s list some possibilities quickly:
- STABY – uses B, Y (both still possible)
- STACH – not a valid word
- STAMP – uses M, P (both still possible)
- STANK – uses N, K (both still possible)
- STAND – uses N, D but D is eliminated
- STARK – uses K (possible), but R is eliminated
- STASH – uses H (possible), but H not yet tested
- STAYS – uses Y (possible), but A is already used in position 3

Among these, “STANK” and “STAMP” look promising.  
“STANK” tests K and N.  
“STAMP” tests M and P.

Either could be correct, but I’ll pick one to test.  
Let’s try “STANK” first.

(If I had to choose one based on letter frequency, N and K are common enough to test together.)

We now know:
1. Exact pattern: S T A _ _
2. Letters eliminated so far: R, O, E, I, D, N, K
3. Still possible letters for positions 4 and 5: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

Looking for common 5-letter words starting with “STA” and using only the still-allowed letters:
- STAB_ – but we need 5 letters, and STAB already uses 4
- STACH – not a valid word
- STAMP – uses M, P (both allowed)
- STAYS – uses Y, but A is already used in position 3
- STABY – uses B, Y (both allowed)
- STAG_ – G is allowed, but STAG doesn’t complete to 5 letters
- STAMP and STABY both fit perfectly.

Between these two, I’ll choose “STAMP” to test M and P.

We now know:
- Fixed prefix: S T A _ _
- Eliminated letters: R, O, E, I, D, N, K, M, P
- Still possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, L, U, V, W, Y

Valid 5-letter English words starting with “STA” that only use the remaining letters:
- STABY – uses B, Y (both still possible)
- STAG_ – no valid 5-letter word here with remaining letters
- STAL_ – STAL doesn’t form a valid word
- STAW_ – STAW isn’t valid
- STAY_ – STAY doesn’t complete to 5 letters

The only valid word left is STABY, which uses the still-allowed letters B and Y.

Therefore, the next logical guess is STABY.

Valid 5-letter English words starting with “STA” using only the remaining letters:

- STAL_ – STAL isn’t a valid word
- STAY_ – already eliminated (Y)
- STAC_ – STAC isn’t valid
- STAF_ – STAF isn’t valid
- STAGS – uses G, S – but S is already used in position 1
- STA… – scanning the dictionary, the only valid word left is STAGS, but S is already used as position 1.

Wait, let’s double-check:
- STAGS – S T A G S – uses S twice, but S is already fixed in position 1. The word would need to be S T A G S, but that’s STAGS, which is valid (plural of stag). However, in Wordle-style games, duplicates are allowed, and we haven’t ruled out S elsewhere.

But we have no information yet about G or about a second S, and we have no other valid words left. So the only possible candidate is STAGS.

Let’s verify:
- STAGS: S (✓), T (✓), A (✓), G (new, allowed), S (new, allowed)
- No eliminated letters are used.

Therefore, STAGS is the only remaining valid guess.
