### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The goal is to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions. 

A good starting word typically includes:
- Common vowels like A, E, I, O, U
- Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc.

One of the most recommended starting words is ""SLATE"" because it covers:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters in English words, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

We now have:

Letters that ARE in the word: L (locked in position 3), S, E  
Letters that are NOT in the word: A, T, R, I, N, D, O  

Constraints:
- L is fixed at position 3.  
- S must be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1st or 3rd).  
- E must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be 5th, so 1, 2, or 4).  

We still need to test other common letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.  
We want a word that:
1. Has L in position 3.  
2. Uses S and E in allowed positions.  
3. Introduces three completely new letters.  

Candidate word: “BELLS” – but we already know S is in the word and we’d be repeating L twice, which isn’t helpful.  
Better candidate: “FLEES”:
- F – new letter  
- L – fixed at 3rd  
- E – allowed in 4th (✓)  
- E – but we’d have E twice; we only know one E exists.  
Next candidate: “HELP” – but it’s 4 letters.  
Next: “GLOVE” – but O is already excluded.  
Next: “CLEFS” – but F is new, C is new, and S is allowed in 5th.  
But L is 2nd here, which is allowed, but we’d have C in 1st, L in 2nd, E in 4th, S in 5th, F in 3rd – but L must be in 3rd, so this is invalid.  

Correct structure: _ _ L _ _  
We need S and E in positions 2, 4, 5 or 1, 2, 4.  

Let’s try “SELLS” – but S would be twice, and L is already in 3rd.  
Not ideal.  

Better: “HELP” – 4 letters.  
Wait, try “CHELS” – but H, C, E, L, S:  
- C in 1st (new)  
- H in 2nd (new)  
- L in 3rd (correct)  
- E in 4th (allowed)  
- S in 5th (allowed)  

This uses three new letters (C, H, E) while respecting all constraints.

But note: we already know E is in the word; we’re not discovering new E’s.  
Actually we need to test new letters, not reuse E.  

Revised: we need three completely new letters not yet tested.  
Let’s try “MELTS” – but T is excluded.  
“BELTS” – T excluded.  
“GELLS” – L twice.  
“PELLS” – L twice.  
“SELLS” – L twice, S twice.  

Better: “CHELS” is valid, but let’s pick a more common word: “HELPS” – but P is new, H is new, L is 3rd, E is 2nd (allowed), S is 5th (allowed).  

Yes, “HELPS” fits:
- H – new  
- E – allowed in 2nd  
- L – fixed 3rd  
- P – new  
- S – allowed in 5th  

This tests two new letters (H, P) but we’d like three.  
Next: “HELP” – 4 letters.  
Next: “CHELS” – 5 letters, C, H, L, E, S – tests C, H, E, S (but E and S are already known).  

We need to test three completely new letters.  
Best candidate: “BELGA” – but A is excluded.  
“FLECK” – but C, K are new, E in 2nd, L in 3rd, F in 1st, K in 5th.  

But E must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be 5th).  
In “FLECK” – E is 2nd, allowed.  
Letters: F, L, E, C, K – tests F, C, K, which are all new.  

This is optimal.

So the next guess is FLECK.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The goal is to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions. 

A good starting word typically includes:
- Common vowels like A, E, I, O, U
- Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc.

One of the most recommended starting words is ""SLATE"" because it covers:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters in English words, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-)  → S is in the word but not in position 1  
- L(-)  → L is in the word but not in position 2  
- A(x)  → A is **not** in the word  
- T(x)  → T is **not** in the word  
- E(-)  → E is in the word but not in position 5  

Letters we now know are in the word: S, L, E  
Letters we now know are **not** in the word: A, T  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, L, E (each at least once)  
2. S is not in position 1  
3. L is not in position 2  
4. E is not in position 5  

To maximize information, pick a word that re-uses the confirmed letters (S, L, E) and introduces new common consonants and vowels not yet tested (like R, N, I, O, etc.). A good candidate is “RISEN”:
- R – new letter, high frequency  
- I – new letter, high frequency  
- S – already confirmed, now in position 3 (allowed because previous S was in position 1)  
- E – already confirmed, now in position 4 (allowed because previous E was in position 5)  
- N – new letter, high frequency  

This tests three new letters (R, I, N) while placing S, L, E in different positions to satisfy the positional constraints.

- L must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2nd)  
- E must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (cannot be 5th)  

We still need to test other common letters (B, C, D, G, H, K, M, O, U, Y, etc.).  
We want a word that:
1. Uses S, L, E exactly once each  
2. Places them in allowed positions

Letters that ARE in the word: L, S, E  
Letters that are NOT in the word:  
A, T, R, I, N, D, O, F, C, K  

Position constraints after Guess 4 (FLECK):  
- L is still only marked “-” (in word, wrong spot) but never “✓”, so L must be somewhere other than position 2.  
- S is still “-” (in word, wrong spot) but never “✓”, so S must be somewhere other than position 1, 3, or 5.  
- E is still “-” (in word, wrong spot) but never “✓”, so E must be somewhere other than positions 2, 4, or 5.

We also know L must be in position 3 (from DOLES feedback: L was “-” but never “✓”, yet in DOLES it was in position 3 and got “-” – wait, that contradicts earlier. Let’s re-read carefully.

Wait, in Guess 3 (DOLES):  
D(x) O(x) L(✓) E(-) S(-)  
So L is in position 3 and is marked ✓ – it is correct there.  
Therefore L is fixed at position 3.

From Guess 4 (FLECK):  
F(x) L(-) E(-) C(x) K(x)  
So L is again marked “-” but since we already have it as ✓ in position 3, this is redundant; the key point is that L is definitely at position 3.

From FLECK we only learn that E and S are still in the word but not in their current positions.  
New positional constraints:  
- S must be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 3).  
- E must be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (cannot be 2, 4, or 5 – wait, from DOLES E was in position 4 and got “-”, so E cannot be 4; from FLECK E was in position 3 but L is there, so E must be in 1 or 2).

So possible positions:  
- L is at 3  
- S must be at 2, 4, or 5  
- E must be at 1 or 2  

We need three completely new letters not yet used: available are B, G, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to pick a word that:  
1. Has L in position 3.  
2. Places S and E in allowed positions.  
3. Uses three new letters.

Candidate: “BELLS” – but L is already at 3, and we’d have two L’s, which isn’t helpful.  
Better: “HELP” – 4 letters.  
Next: “BELGA” – A excluded.  
“GELLS” – L twice.  
“MELTS” – T excluded.  
“SELLS” – L at 3, S at 2 and 5, but we’d have two S’s.  
We want each of S and E exactly once.

Let’s try “BESOM” – but O is excluded.  
“HESIT” – I, T excluded.  
“MESON” – N excluded.  
“PESOS” – O, S at 5, but O is excluded.  
“WESKS” – K excluded.  
“YESKY” – K excluded.  
“ZESKY” – K excluded.

Looking at remaining letters, a good set is B, G, H, M, P, U, Y.

Try “HELP” – 4 letters.  
Try “BELUM” – B, E, L, U, M.  
Positions: B(1), E(2), L(3), U(4), M(5).  
- L is at 3 – ✓  
- E is at 2 – allowed (cannot be 2, 4, or 5 – from DOLES E was at 4 and got “-”, from FLECK E was at 3 but L is there, so E must be at 1 or 2) – E is at 2 – allowed.  
- S must be used – but S is not in BELUM. We need to include S.

We must include S somewhere.  
Try “BESMS” – but S is at 5, M at 4, B at 1, E at 2, S at 5 – two S’s. Not allowed.

Try “HELPY” – Y at 5, but missing S.

Try “SHELL” – H at 2, E at 4 – but E cannot be 4, and L is at 3.  
“SHELL” – E at 4 is invalid.

Try “HESPE” – P at 4, E at 5 – E cannot be 5.

Try “BELPS” – P at 4, S at 5, E at 2, L at 3, B at 1.  
Positions:  
1: B – new  
2: E – allowed (must be 1 or 2, here 2)  
3: L – ✓  
4: P – new  
5: S – allowed (must be 2, 4, or 5, here 5)  

This satisfies all constraints and uses three new letters (B, P, and already known S, E, L).

So the next guess is BELPS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The goal is to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions. 

A good starting word typically includes:
- Common vowels like A, E, I, O, U
- Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc.

One of the most recommended starting words is ""SLATE"" because it covers:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters in English words, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-)  → S is in the word but not in position 1  
- L(-)  → L is in the word but not in position 2  
- A(x)  → A is **not** in the word  
- T(x)  → T is **not** in the word  
- E(-)  → E is in the word but not in position 5  

Letters we now know are in the word: S, L, E  
Letters we now know are **not** in the word: A, T  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, L, E (each at least once)  
2. S is not in position 1  
3. L is not in position 2  
4. E is not in position 5  

To maximize information, pick a word that re-uses the confirmed letters (S, L, E) and introduces new common consonants and vowels not yet tested (like R, N, I, O, etc.). A good candidate is “RISEN”:
- R – new letter, high frequency  
- I – new letter, high frequency  
- S – already confirmed, now in position 3 (allowed because previous S was in position 1)  
- E – already confirmed, now in position 4 (allowed because previous E was in position 5)  
- N – new letter, high frequency  

This tests three new letters (R, I, N) while placing S, L, E in different positions to satisfy the positional constraints.

From the two guesses we know:

Letters that ARE in the word: S, L, E  
Letters that are NOT in the word: A, T, R, I, N  

Constraints on the known letters:
- S must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1st)  
- L must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2nd)  
- E must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (cannot be 5th)  

We still need to test other common letters (B, C, D, G, H, K, M, O, U, Y, etc.).  
We want a word that:
1. Uses S, L, E exactly once each  
2. Places them in allowed positions  
3. Introduces three completely new letters  

A good candidate is “DOLES”:
- D – new, high-frequency consonant  
- O – new, common vowel  
- L – allowed positions 3 or 4  
- E – allowed positions 1, 2, 3, 4  
- S – allowed positions 2, 3, 4, 5  

This satisfies every constraint and tests three new letters.

We now have:

Letters that ARE in the word: L (locked in position 3), S, E  
Letters that are NOT in the word: A, T, R, I, N, D, O  

Constraints:
- L is fixed at position 3.  
- S must be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1st or 3rd).  
- E must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be 5th, so 1, 2, or 4).  

We still need to test other common letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.  
We want a word that:
1. Has L in position 3.  
2. Uses S and E in allowed positions.  
3. Introduces three completely new letters.  

Candidate word: “BELLS” – but we already know S is in the word and we’d be repeating L twice, which isn’t helpful.  
Better candidate: “FLEES”:
- F – new letter  
- L – fixed at 3rd  
- E – allowed in 4th (✓)  
- E – but we’d have E twice; we only know one E exists.  
Next candidate: “HELP” – but it’s 4 letters.  
Next: “GLOVE” – but O is already excluded.  
Next: “CLEFS” – but F is new, C is new, and S is allowed in 5th.  
But L is 2nd here, which is allowed, but we’d have C in 1st, L in 2nd, E in 4th, S in 5th, F in 3rd – but L must be in 3rd, so this is invalid.  

Correct structure: _ _ L _ _  
We need S and E in positions 2, 4, 5 or 1, 2, 4.  

Let’s try “SELLS” – but S would be twice, and L is already in 3rd.  
Not ideal.  

Better: “HELP” – 4 letters.  
Wait, try “CHELS” – but H, C, E, L, S:  
- C in 1st (new)  
- H in 2nd (new)  
- L in 3rd (correct)  
- E in 4th (allowed)  
- S in 5th (allowed)  

This uses three new letters (C, H, E) while respecting all constraints.

But note: we already know E is in the word; we’re not discovering new E’s.  
Actually we need to test new letters, not reuse E.  

Revised: we need three completely new letters not yet tested.  
Let’s try “MELTS” – but T is excluded.  
“BELTS” – T excluded.  
“GELLS” – L twice.  
“PELLS” – L twice.  
“SELLS” – L twice, S twice.  

Better: “CHELS” is valid, but let’s pick a more common word: “HELPS” – but P is new, H is new, L is 3rd, E is 2nd (allowed), S is 5th (allowed).  

Yes, “HELPS” fits:
- H – new  
- E – allowed in 2nd  
- L – fixed 3rd  
- P – new  
- S – allowed in 5th  

This tests two new letters (H, P) but we’d like three.  
Next: “HELP” – 4 letters.  
Next: “CHELS” – 5 letters, C, H, L, E, S – tests C, H, E, S (but E and S are already known).  

We need to test three completely new letters.  
Best candidate: “BELGA” – but A is excluded.  
“FLECK” – but C, K are new, E in 2nd, L in 3rd, F in 1st, K in 5th.  

But E must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be 5th).  
In “FLECK” – E is 2nd, allowed.  
Letters: F, L, E, C, K – tests F, C, K, which are all new.  

This is optimal.

So the next guess is FLECK.

- E must be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (cannot be 2, 4, or 5 – wait, from DOLES E was in position 4 and got “-”, so E cannot be 4; from FLECK E was in position 3 but L is there, so E must be in 1 or 2).

So possible positions:  
- L is at 3  
- S must be at 2, 4, or 5  
- E must be at 1 or 2  

We need three completely new letters not yet used: available are B, G, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to pick a word that:  
1. Has L in position 3.  
2. Places S and E in allowed positions.  
3. Uses three new letters.

Candidate: “BELLS” – but L is already at 3, and we’d have two L’s, which isn’t helpful.  
Better: “HELP” – 4 letters.  
Next: “BELGA” – A excluded.  
“GELLS” – L twice.  
“MELTS” – T excluded.  
“SELLS” – L at 3, S at 2 and 5, but we’d have two S’s.  
We want each of S and E exactly once.

Let’s try “BESOM” – but O is excluded.  
“HESIT” – I, T excluded.  
“MESON” – N excluded.  
“PESOS” – O, S at 5, but O is excluded.  
“WESKS” – K excluded.  
“YESKY” – K excluded.  
“ZESKY” – K excluded.

Looking at remaining letters, a good set is B, G, H, M, P, U, Y.

Try “HELP” – 4 letters.  
Try “BELUM” – B, E, L, U, M.  
Positions: B(1), E(2), L(3), U(4), M(5).  
- L is at 3 – ✓  
- E is at 2 – allowed (cannot be 2, 4, or 5 – from DOLES E was at 4 and got “-”, from FLECK E was at 3 but L is there, so E must be at 1 or 2) – E is at 2 – allowed.  
- S must be used – but S is not in BELUM. We need to include S.

We must include S somewhere.  
Try “BESMS” – but S is at 5, M at 4, B at 1, E at 2, S at 5 – two S’s. Not allowed.

Try “HELPY” – Y at 5, but missing S.

Try “SHELL” – H at 2, E at 4 – but E cannot be 4, and L is at 3.  
“SHELL” – E at 4 is invalid.

Try “HESPE” – P at 4, E at 5 – E cannot be 5.

Try “BELPS” – P at 4, S at 5, E at 2, L at 3, B at 1.  
Positions:  
1: B – new  
2: E – allowed (must be 1 or 2, here 2)  
3: L – ✓  
4: P – new  
5: S – allowed (must be 2, 4, or 5, here 5)  

This satisfies all constraints and uses three new letters (B, P, and already known S, E, L).

So the next guess is BELPS.
