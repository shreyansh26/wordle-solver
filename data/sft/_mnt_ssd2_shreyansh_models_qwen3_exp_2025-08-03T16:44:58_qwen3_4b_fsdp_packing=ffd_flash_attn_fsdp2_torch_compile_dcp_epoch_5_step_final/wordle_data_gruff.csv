### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to test.

All five letters from SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.

A balanced choice is “CRIMP”:

From the feedback so far:

- Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, C, I, M, P, H, O, D  
- Known correct letter and position: R is in the 2nd spot (pattern _ R _ _ _)
- Known correct letter but wrong position: U is somewhere in the word, but not in position 5.

So U must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Remaining common letters not yet tested: B, F, G, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Of these, the most frequent usable ones are B, F, G, K, N, W.

We need a 5-letter word:
- Form: _ R _ _ _
- Contains U somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 4)
- Uses only the still-allowed letters

Let’s test possible placements of U:

1. U R _ _ _  → e.g., UR*** – but UR is not the start of common 5-letter words.
2. _ R U _ _  → e.g., B R U C K, F R U I T, G R U N T, N R U T H, W R U N G  
   Among these, “BRUCK” is valid but uncommon; “FRUIT” has I (already ruled out);  
   “GRUNT” is valid; “WRUNG” is valid.

   W R I N U (I ruled out).

Best valid words left: GRUNT, WRUNG, BRUNG, GRUBS (but S is out), etc.

“GRUNT” is a strong candidate: G, R, U, N, T – all allowed letters, U in position 3, T is still possible (only ruled out in SLATE, but count as used there). Wait, T is actually ruled out (from SLATE feedback: T(x)).

So T is out. Let’s try “BRUNG”: B, R, U, N, G – all allowed, U in position 3.

Another option is “FRUNK” – but that’s not a common word.

“WRUNG” is also valid: W, R, U, N, G – all allowed, U in position 3.

Between BRUNG and WRUNG, both are valid, but “BRUNG” is slightly more common in everyday usage.

Let’s go with BRUNG.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to test.

<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters from SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That removes a lot of common letters, so I need a fresh set.  
I’ll try a word that avoids those five letters entirely and still covers other high-frequency letters.  
Good candidates now: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, K, M, P, etc.

A balanced choice is “CRIMP”:
- C – common consonant
- R – very common
- I – common vowel
- M – common consonant
- P – common consonant

None of these letters overlap with the eliminated ones, and they should provide new information.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, C, I, M, P
- Letter R is in the word and is in the correct position (second spot).

We have the pattern: _ R _ _ _

Remaining common letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, K, N, O, U, W, Y, etc.

I want a word that:
1. Has R in position 2
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out
3. Covers other common letters to narrow down possibilities quickly

Good candidates:
- BRAND (B, N, D – but D is less common)
- FORGE (F, O, G, E – but E is out)
- HOUND (H, O, U, N – good letters left)
- GROUN (G, O, U, N – but N is in position 5, which might be okay)
- BROWN (B, O, W, N – but W is less common)

""HOUND"" looks strong because it uses H, O, U, N – all still possible, and tests vowels O and U along with consonants H and N.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, C, I, M, P, H, O, D  
- Known correct letter and position: R is in the 2nd spot (pattern _ R _ _ _)
- Known correct letter but wrong position: U is somewhere in the word, but not in position 5.

So U must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

2. _ R U _ _  → e.g., B R U C K, F R U I T, G R U N T, N R U T H, W R U N G  
   Among these, “BRUCK” is valid but uncommon; “FRUIT” has I (already ruled out);  
   “GRUNT” is valid; “WRUNG” is valid.

3. _ R _ U _  → e.g., B R I N G (I ruled out), F R O U D (O ruled out),  
   G R I V E (I, E ruled out), N R I V E (I, E ruled out), B R U N G (B, U, N, G – all allowed).

4. _ R _ _ U  → e.g., B R I N U (I ruled out), F R O N U (O ruled out),  
   G R I N U (I ruled out), N R I V U (I, V, U – but N is in position 1, which could work, but I is out),  
   W R I N U (I ruled out).

Best valid words left: GRUNT, WRUNG, BRUNG, GRUBS (but S is out), etc.

“GRUNT” is a strong candidate: G, R, U, N, T – all allowed letters, U in position 3, T is still possible (only ruled out in SLATE, but count as used there). Wait, T is actually ruled out (from SLATE feedback: T(x)).

So T is out. Let’s try “BRUNG”: B, R, U, N, G – all allowed, U in position 3.
