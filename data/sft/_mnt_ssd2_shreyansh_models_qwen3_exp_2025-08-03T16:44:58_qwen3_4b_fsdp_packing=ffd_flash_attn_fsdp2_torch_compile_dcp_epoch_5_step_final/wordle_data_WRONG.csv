For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

Looking at the most common letters in 5-letter English words, the word ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This combination gives us maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions. Other good first guesses could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong with its high vowel count and common consonants.

From the feedback on “arose”:

A(x) – A is not in the word.  
R(✓) – R is in the correct position (2nd letter).  
O(✓) – O is in the correct position (3rd letter).  
S(x) – S is not in the word.  
E(x) – E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R O _ _
- Letters definitely absent: A, S, E

To maximize information, I should pick a word that:
1. Keeps R and O in positions 2 and 3.
2. Introduces new common letters not yet tested (like T, N, L, C, H, etc.).
3. Avoids A, S, E entirely.

A good candidate is “FRONT”:
- It places R in position 2 and O in position 3.
- It tests F, T, N (all new letters).
- It avoids the eliminated A, S, E.

Other possibilities could be “GROIN”, “CROON”, or “DROWN”, but “FRONT” is simple and tests three new consonants.

We now know:
- Pattern: _ R O N _
- Letters definitely absent: A, S, E, F, T
- Letters definitely present and in position: R (2), O (3), N (4)

We need a 5-letter word with:
- R as the 2nd letter
- O as the 3rd letter
- N as the 4th letter
- No A, S, E, F, T
- The 1st and 5th letters must be new letters not yet tested.

Common remaining consonants not yet tested: B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z.

Let’s try to pick a word that uses common remaining letters for the 1st and 5th positions. Good candidates:
- B R O N D (but D hasn’t been tested yet)
- C R O N D
- G R O N D
- H R O N D
- M R O N D
- P R O N D
- V R O N D

Among these, “GROND” isn’t a valid word, but “GROIN” is valid (though it reuses N which we already know is in position 4). Instead, let’s try “BRON_” — but we need a valid word.

Looking at valid words fitting _ R O N _:
- BRON_ doesn’t yield a valid word.
- CRON_ gives CRONE (invalid because E is eliminated)
- DRON_ gives DRONE (invalid because E is eliminated)
- GRON_ gives GRON (invalid)
- PRON_ gives PRONG (invalid)
- BRON_ doesn’t work.

Wait, let’s list valid words with pattern * R O N *:
- CRONE – E eliminated
- FROND – F eliminated
- GROND – not a word
- PRONG – not a word
- BRON_ – none

Hmm, let’s try different approach: look for valid words with R O N in positions 2-4 and no forbidden letters.

Valid words:
- BRAND – but A is eliminated
- CRONE – E eliminated
- FROND – F and D, but F eliminated
- GRON_ – none
- PRONG – not a word
- TRON_ – T eliminated

Wait, let’s check “CRONY” – but Y hasn’t been tested. Pattern is _ R O N Y, but we need 5 letters. Actually, we need _ R O N _.

Valid words:
- CRONE – E eliminated
- FROND – F eliminated
- GRON_ – none
- PRON_ – none
- DRON_ – none

Wait, let’s think of words with R O N in positions 2-4 and no A, S, E, F, T.

Valid words:
- BRAND – A eliminated
- CRONE – E eliminated
- FROND – F eliminated
- GRON_ – none
- PRONG – not a word
- TRON_ – T eliminated

This seems limited. Let’s try “CRONY” but it’s 5 letters and ends with Y, but we have _ R O N _.

Actually, let’s list valid 5-letter words with R O N in positions 2-4 and no A, S, E, F, T:

- CRONE – E eliminated
- FROND – F eliminated
- GRON_ – none
- PRONG – not a word
- DRON_ – none
- BRON_ – none

This is surprising. Let me check again:

Valid words fitting _ R O N _ with no A, S, E, F, T:

- CRONE – E is in it, so no
- FROND – F and D, but F is eliminated
- GRON_ – no valid word
- PRONG – not a word
- BRON_ – no valid word
- CRON_ – CRONE is invalid
- DRON_ – DRONE is invalid
- GRON_ – none
- PRON_ – none

Wait, let’s try “CRONY” but it’s _ R O N Y, which is 5 letters. Is CRONY valid? Yes, it’s a 5-letter word.

But we have pattern _ R O N _ (positions 2-4), so CRONY would be C R O N Y, which fits. And Y hasn’t been tested yet.

So CRONY is a valid word: C R O N Y, with no A, S, E, F, T.

But we know N is in position 4, so CRONY would be C R O N Y, which fits _ R O N _.

Therefore, CRONY is a good next guess.

But wait, let me double-check:
- C – new letter
- R – confirmed in position 2
- O – confirmed in position 3
- N – confirmed in position 4
- Y – new letter

And none of A, S, E, F, T are present.

CRONY is a valid word.

Alternatively, another valid word could be “BRON_” but there’s no valid word like BRON*. 

Thus, CRONY seems to be the best next guess.

But let me think if there’s a more common word. Another valid word is “PRONG” but that’s not a common word. “CRONY” is more common.

Therefore, I will go with CRONY.

However, let me check if CRONY is accepted as a valid 5-letter word in Wordle-like games. Yes, CRONY is valid.

Thus, the next guess is CRONY.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

Looking at the most common letters in 5-letter English words, the word ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This combination gives us maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions. Other good first guesses could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong with its high vowel count and common consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:

A(x) – A is not in the word.  
R(✓) – R is in the correct position (2nd letter).  
O(✓) – O is in the correct position (3rd letter).  
S(x) – S is not in the word.  
E(x) – E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R O _ _
- Letters definitely absent: A, S, E

To maximize information, I should pick a word that:
1. Keeps R and O in positions 2 and 3.
2. Introduces new common letters not yet tested (like T, N, L, C, H, etc.).
3. Avoids A, S, E entirely.

A good candidate is “FRONT”:
- It places R in position 2 and O in position 3.
- It tests F, T, N (all new letters).
- It avoids the eliminated A, S, E.

Other possibilities could be “GROIN”, “CROON”, or “DROWN”, but “FRONT” is simple and tests three new consonants.

We now know:
- Pattern: _ R O N _
- Letters definitely absent: A, S, E, F, T
- Letters definitely present and in position: R (2), O (3), N (4)

We need a 5-letter word with:
- R as the 2nd letter
- O as the 3rd letter
- N as the 4th letter
- No A, S, E, F, T
- The 1st and 5th letters must be new letters not yet tested.

Common remaining consonants not yet tested: B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z.

Let’s try to pick a word that uses common remaining letters for the 1st and 5th positions. Good candidates:
- B R O N D (but D hasn’t been tested yet)
- C R O N D
- G R O N D
- H R O N D
- M R O N D
- P R O N D
- V R O N D

Among these, “GROND” isn’t a valid word, but “GROIN” is valid (though it reuses N which we already know is in position 4). Instead, let’s try “BRON_” — but we need a valid word.

Looking at valid words fitting _ R O N _:
- BRON_ doesn’t yield a valid word.
- CRON_ gives CRONE (invalid because E is eliminated)
- DRON_ gives DRONE (invalid because E is eliminated)
- GRON_ gives GRON (invalid)
- PRON_ gives PRONG (invalid)
- BRON_ doesn’t work.

Wait, let’s list valid words with pattern * R O N *:
- CRONE – E eliminated
- FROND – F eliminated
- GROND – not a word
- PRONG – not a word
- BRON_ – none

Hmm, let’s try different approach: look for valid words with R O N in positions 2-4 and no forbidden letters.

Valid words:
- BRAND – but A is eliminated
- CRONE – E eliminated
- FROND – F and D, but F eliminated
- GRON_ – none
- PRONG – not a word
- TRON_ – T eliminated

Wait, let’s check “CRONY” – but Y hasn’t been tested. Pattern is _ R O N Y, but we need 5 letters. Actually, we need _ R O N _.

Valid words:
- CRONE – E eliminated
- FROND – F eliminated
- GRON_ – none
- PRON_ – none
- DRON_ – none

Wait, let’s think of words with R O N in positions 2-4 and no A, S, E, F, T.

Valid words:
- BRAND – A eliminated
- CRONE – E eliminated
- FROND – F eliminated
- GRON_ – none
- PRONG – not a word
- TRON_ – T eliminated

This seems limited. Let’s try “CRONY” but it’s 5 letters and ends with Y, but we have _ R O N _.

Actually, let’s list valid 5-letter words with R O N in positions 2-4 and no A, S, E, F, T:

- CRONE – E eliminated
- FROND – F eliminated
- GRON_ – none
- PRONG – not a word
- DRON_ – none
- BRON_ – none

This is surprising. Let me check again:

Valid words fitting _ R O N _ with no A, S, E, F, T:

- CRONE – E is in it, so no
- FROND – F and D, but F is eliminated
- GRON_ – no valid word
- PRONG – not a word
- BRON_ – no valid word
- CRON_ – CRONE is invalid
- DRON_ – DRONE is invalid
- GRON_ – none
- PRON_ – none

Wait, let’s try “CRONY” but it’s _ R O N Y, which is 5 letters. Is CRONY valid? Yes, it’s a 5-letter word.

But we have pattern _ R O N _ (positions 2-4), so CRONY would be C R O N Y, which fits. And Y hasn’t been tested yet.

So CRONY is a valid word: C R O N Y, with no A, S, E, F, T.

But we know N is in position 4, so CRONY would be C R O N Y, which fits _ R O N _.

Therefore, CRONY is a good next guess.

But wait, let me double-check:
- C – new letter
- R – confirmed in position 2
- O – confirmed in position 3
- N – confirmed in position 4
- Y – new letter

And none of A, S, E, F, T are present.

CRONY is a valid word.

Alternatively, another valid word could be “BRON_” but there’s no valid word like BRON*. 

Thus, CRONY seems to be the best next guess.

But let me think if there’s a more common word. Another valid word is “PRONG” but that’s not a common word. “CRONY” is more common.

Therefore, I will go with CRONY.

However, let me check if CRONY is accepted as a valid 5-letter word in Wordle-like games. Yes, CRONY is valid.

Thus, the next guess is CRONY.

From the combined feedback we now know:

- Remaining unused common consonants for the 1st and 5th spots: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word that looks like _ R O N _ and only uses letters not yet eliminated.

Looking at common English words fitting this pattern:
- BRON_ – no valid word
- DRON_ – no valid word
- GRON_ – no valid word
- HRON_ – no valid word
- KRON_ – no valid word
- LRON_ – no valid word
- MRON_ – no valid word
- PRON_ – PRONG is invalid (not a common word)
- VRON_ – no valid word
- WRON_ – no valid word
- ZRON_ – no valid word

This is very restrictive. The only other valid word I can find fitting _ R O N _ with no eliminated letters is “GROIN”, but it would be G R O I N, which breaks the pattern because I is not yet confirmed and we already know N is in position 4.

Wait, let me re-examine the pattern: we have _ R O N _ (positions 2-4 fixed as R, O, N). The only remaining valid English word fitting this exact pattern with no banned letters is “CRONE” and “FROND”, but both use eliminated letters (E, C, F).

This suggests I may have made an error in earlier steps. Let me re-confirm:

- Pattern so far: _ R O N _
- Eliminated letters: A, S, E, F, T, C, Y
- Valid remaining letters: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Z plus any untested vowels (I, U).

We could try a word like “GRON_” but no valid word ends here. Instead, let’s try inserting I or U in the 5th spot, as they haven’t been ruled out.

Valid words:
- G R O N I – GRONI (not a word)
- P R O N I – PRONI (not a word)
- B R O N I – BRONI (not a word)

The only actual valid word I can find that fits _ R O N _ with no banned letters is “GROIN” (G R O I N), but that would require I in position 5, and I hasn’t been eliminated. Let me check if I is available – yes, I has not appeared in any feedback.

Therefore, “GROIN” is a valid next guess.

Alternatively, another valid word is “PRONG” but that’s not common. “GROIN” seems the best.

Let me verify:
- G – new letter
- R – confirmed in position 2

No eliminated letters are used.

Thus, the next guess is GROIN.

- DRON_ – none

Wait, let’s think of words with R O N in positions 2-4 and no A, S, E, F, T.

Valid words:
- BRAND – A eliminated
- CRONE – E eliminated
- FROND – F eliminated
- GRON_ – none
- PRONG – not a word
- TRON_ – T eliminated

This seems limited. Let’s try “CRONY” but it’s 5 letters and ends with Y, but we have _ R O N _.

Actually, let’s list valid 5-letter words with R O N in positions 2-4 and no A, S, E, F, T:

- CRONE – E eliminated
- FROND – F eliminated
- GRON_ – none
- PRONG – not a word
- DRON_ – none
- BRON_ – none

This is surprising. Let me check again:

Valid words fitting _ R O N _ with no A, S, E, F, T:

- CRONE – E is in it, so no
- FROND – F and D, but F is eliminated
- GRON_ – no valid word
- PRONG – not a word
- BRON_ – no valid word
- CRON_ – CRONE is invalid
- DRON_ – DRONE is invalid
- GRON_ – none
- PRON_ – none

Wait, let’s try “CRONY” but it’s _ R O N Y, which is 5 letters. Is CRONY valid? Yes, it’s a 5-letter word.

But we have pattern _ R O N _ (positions 2-4), so CRONY would be C R O N Y, which fits. And Y hasn’t been tested yet.

So CRONY is a valid word: C R O N Y, with no A, S, E, F, T.

But we know N is in position 4, so CRONY would be C R O N Y, which fits _ R O N _.

Therefore, CRONY is a good next guess.

But wait, let me double-check:
- C – new letter
- R – confirmed in position 2
- O – confirmed in position 3
- N – confirmed in position 4
- Y – new letter

And none of A, S, E, F, T are present.

CRONY is a valid word.

Alternatively, another valid word could be “BRON_” but there’s no valid word like BRON*. 

Thus, CRONY seems to be the best next guess.

But let me think if there’s a more common word. Another valid word is “PRONG” but that’s not a common word. “CRONY” is more common.

Therefore, I will go with CRONY.

However, let me check if CRONY is accepted as a valid 5-letter word in Wordle-like games. Yes, CRONY is valid.

Thus, the next guess is CRONY.

From the combined feedback we now know:
- Positions: 1st letter unknown, 2nd R, 3rd O, 4th N, 5th letter unknown.
- Eliminated letters: A, S, E, F, T, C, Y.
- Remaining unused common consonants for the 1st and 5th spots: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word that looks like _ R O N _ and only uses letters not yet eliminated.

Looking at common English words fitting this pattern:
- BRON_ – no valid word
- DRON_ – no valid word
- GRON_ – no valid word
- HRON_ – no valid word
- KRON_ – no valid word
- LRON_ – no valid word
- MRON_ – no valid word
- PRON_ – PRONG is invalid (not a common word)
- VRON_ – no valid word
- WRON_ – no valid word
- ZRON_ – no valid word

This is very restrictive. The only other valid word I can find fitting _ R O N _ with no eliminated letters is “GROIN”, but it would be G R O I N, which breaks the pattern because I is not yet confirmed and we already know N is in position 4.

Wait, let me re-examine the pattern: we have _ R O N _ (positions 2-4 fixed as R, O, N). The only remaining valid English word fitting this exact pattern with no banned letters is “CRONE” and “FROND”, but both use eliminated letters (E, C, F).

This suggests I may have made an error in earlier steps. Let me re-confirm:

- Pattern so far: _ R O N _
- Eliminated letters: A, S, E, F, T, C, Y
- Valid remaining letters: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Z plus any untested vowels (I, U).

We could try a word like “GRON_” but no valid word ends here. Instead, let’s try inserting I or U in the 5th spot, as they haven’t been ruled out.

Valid words:
- G R O N I – GRONI (not a word)
- P R O N I – PRONI (not a word)
- B R O N I – BRONI (not a word)

The only actual valid word I can find that fits _ R O N _ with no banned letters is “GROIN” (G R O I N), but that would require I in position 5, and I hasn’t been eliminated. Let me check if I is available – yes, I has not appeared in any feedback.

Therefore, “GROIN” is a valid next guess.

Alternatively, another valid word is “PRONG” but that’s not common. “GROIN” seems the best.

Let me verify:
- G – new letter
- R – confirmed in position 2
- O – confirmed in position 3
- I – new letter (not eliminated)
- N – confirmed in position 4

No eliminated letters are used.

Thus, the next guess is GROIN.

Guess 4: groun → positions are:
1: G 2: R 3: O 4: U 5: N

- R is in position 2 and correct (✓)
- O is in position 3 and correct (✓)
- U is not in the word (x)
- N is in the word but not in position 5

But we already know from Guess 2 that N is in position 4. So the feedback for Guess 4 is telling us N is in the word but not in position 5 (which is redundant since we already know it’s in 4), but it also tells us U is not in the word.

So the pattern is now:

Eliminated letters so far: A, S, E, F, T, C, Y, U

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

Looking at the most common letters in 5-letter English words, the word ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This combination gives us maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions. Other good first guesses could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong with its high vowel count and common consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:

A(x) – A is not in the word.  
R(✓) – R is in the correct position (2nd letter).  
O(✓) – O is in the correct position (3rd letter).  
S(x) – S is not in the word.  
E(x) – E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R O _ _
- Letters definitely absent: A, S, E

To maximize information, I should pick a word that:
1. Keeps R and O in positions 2 and 3.
2. Introduces new common letters not yet tested (like T, N, L, C, H, etc.).
3. Avoids A, S, E entirely.

A good candidate is “FRONT”:
- It places R in position 2 and O in position 3.
- It tests F, T, N (all new letters).
- It avoids the eliminated A, S, E.

Other possibilities could be “GROIN”, “CROON”, or “DROWN”, but “FRONT” is simple and tests three new consonants.

We now know:
- Pattern: _ R O N _
- Letters definitely absent: A, S, E, F, T
- Letters definitely present and in position: R (2), O (3), N (4)

We need a 5-letter word with:
- R as the 2nd letter
- O as the 3rd letter
- N as the 4th letter
- No A, S, E, F, T
- The 1st and 5th letters must be new letters not yet tested.

Common remaining consonants not yet tested: B, C, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z.

Let’s try to pick a word that uses common remaining letters for the 1st and 5th positions. Good candidates:
- B R O N D (but D hasn’t been tested yet)
- C R O N D
- G R O N D
- H R O N D
- M R O N D
- P R O N D
- V R O N D

Among these, “GROND” isn’t a valid word, but “GROIN” is valid (though it reuses N which we already know is in position 4). Instead, let’s try “BRON_” — but we need a valid word.

Looking at valid words fitting _ R O N _:
- BRON_ doesn’t yield a valid word.
- CRON_ gives CRONE (invalid because E is eliminated)
- DRON_ gives DRONE (invalid because E is eliminated)
- GRON_ gives GRON (invalid)
- PRON_ gives PRONG (invalid)
- BRON_ doesn’t work.

Wait, let’s list valid words with pattern * R O N *:
- CRONE – E eliminated
- FROND – F eliminated
- GROND – not a word
- PRONG – not a word
- BRON_ – none

Hmm, let’s try different approach: look for valid words with R O N in positions 2-4 and no forbidden letters.

Valid words:
- BRAND – but A is eliminated
- CRONE – E eliminated
- FROND – F and D, but F eliminated
- GRON_ – none
- PRONG – not a word
- TRON_ – T eliminated

Wait, let’s check “CRONY” – but Y hasn’t been tested. Pattern is _ R O N Y, but we need 5 letters. Actually, we need _ R O N _.

Valid words:
- CRONE – E eliminated
- FROND – F eliminated
- GRON_ – none
- PRON_ – none
- DRON_ – none

Wait, let’s think of words with R O N in positions 2-4 and no A, S, E, F, T.

Valid words:
- BRAND – A eliminated
- CRONE – E eliminated
- FROND – F eliminated
- GRON_ – none
- PRONG – not a word
- TRON_ – T eliminated

This seems limited. Let’s try “CRONY” but it’s 5 letters and ends with Y, but we have _ R O N _.

Actually, let’s list valid 5-letter words with R O N in positions 2-4 and no A, S, E, F, T:

- CRONE – E eliminated
- FROND – F eliminated
- GRON_ – none
- PRONG – not a word
- DRON_ – none
- BRON_ – none

This is surprising. Let me check again:

Valid words fitting _ R O N _ with no A, S, E, F, T:

- CRONE – E is in it, so no
- FROND – F and D, but F is eliminated
- GRON_ – no valid word
- PRONG – not a word
- BRON_ – no valid word
- CRON_ – CRONE is invalid
- DRON_ – DRONE is invalid
- GRON_ – none
- PRON_ – none

Wait, let’s try “CRONY” but it’s _ R O N Y, which is 5 letters. Is CRONY valid? Yes, it’s a 5-letter word.

But we have pattern _ R O N _ (positions 2-4), so CRONY would be C R O N Y, which fits. And Y hasn’t been tested yet.

So CRONY is a valid word: C R O N Y, with no A, S, E, F, T.

But we know N is in position 4, so CRONY would be C R O N Y, which fits _ R O N _.

Therefore, CRONY is a good next guess.

But wait, let me double-check:
- C – new letter
- R – confirmed in position 2
- O – confirmed in position 3
- N – confirmed in position 4
- Y – new letter

And none of A, S, E, F, T are present.

CRONY is a valid word.

Alternatively, another valid word could be “BRON_” but there’s no valid word like BRON*. 

Thus, CRONY seems to be the best next guess.

But let me think if there’s a more common word. Another valid word is “PRONG” but that’s not a common word. “CRONY” is more common.

Therefore, I will go with CRONY.

However, let me check if CRONY is accepted as a valid 5-letter word in Wordle-like games. Yes, CRONY is valid.

Thus, the next guess is CRONY.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)

Guess 3: crony -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(✓) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the combined feedback we now know:
- Positions: 1st letter unknown, 2nd R, 3rd O, 4th N, 5th letter unknown.
- Eliminated letters: A, S, E, F, T, C, Y.
- Remaining unused common consonants for the 1st and 5th spots: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word that looks like _ R O N _ and only uses letters not yet eliminated.

Looking at common English words fitting this pattern:
- BRON_ – no valid word
- DRON_ – no valid word
- GRON_ – no valid word
- HRON_ – no valid word
- KRON_ – no valid word
- LRON_ – no valid word
- MRON_ – no valid word
- PRON_ – PRONG is invalid (not a common word)
- VRON_ – no valid word
- WRON_ – no valid word
- ZRON_ – no valid word

This is very restrictive. The only other valid word I can find fitting _ R O N _ with no eliminated letters is “GROIN”, but it would be G R O I N, which breaks the pattern because I is not yet confirmed and we already know N is in position 4.

Wait, let me re-examine the pattern: we have _ R O N _ (positions 2-4 fixed as R, O, N). The only remaining valid English word fitting this exact pattern with no banned letters is “CRONE” and “FROND”, but both use eliminated letters (E, C, F).

This suggests I may have made an error in earlier steps. Let me re-confirm:

- Pattern so far: _ R O N _
- Eliminated letters: A, S, E, F, T, C, Y
- Valid remaining letters: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Z plus any untested vowels (I, U).

We could try a word like “GRON_” but no valid word ends here. Instead, let’s try inserting I or U in the 5th spot, as they haven’t been ruled out.

Valid words:
- G R O N I – GRONI (not a word)
- P R O N I – PRONI (not a word)
- B R O N I – BRONI (not a word)

The only actual valid word I can find that fits _ R O N _ with no banned letters is “GROIN” (G R O I N), but that would require I in position 5, and I hasn’t been eliminated. Let me check if I is available – yes, I has not appeared in any feedback.

Therefore, “GROIN” is a valid next guess.

Alternatively, another valid word is “PRONG” but that’s not common. “GROIN” seems the best.

Let me verify:
- G – new letter
- R – confirmed in position 2
- O – confirmed in position 3
- I – new letter (not eliminated)
- N – confirmed in position 4

No eliminated letters are used.

Thus, the next guess is GROIN.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: front -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: crony -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(✓) Y(x)
Guess 4: groun -> FEEDBACK: G(-) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) N(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

1. Pattern: _ R O _ _  (positions 2-3 are R O, but N is in position 4)
   Actually, from feedback:
   - Guess 2: front → F(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(✓) T(x)  ⇒ positions 2-4 = R O N
   - Guess 3: crony → C(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(✓) Y(x)  ⇒ confirms positions 2-4 = R O N
   - Guess 4: groun → G(-) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) N(-)  ⇒ G is in word but wrong place (so G must be in position 1 or 5), N is in word but wrong place (but we already know N is in position 4 from earlier, so this must be a mis-read).

Wait, let’s re-parse the feedback carefully:

Guess 4: groun → positions are:
1: G 2: R 3: O 4: U 5: N  
Feedback symbols: G(-) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) N(-)

This means:
- G is in the word but not in position 1
- R is in position 2 and correct (✓)
- O is in position 3 and correct (✓)
- U is not in the word (x)
- N is in the word but not in position 5

But we already know from Guess 2 that N is in position 4. So the feedback for Guess 4 is telling us N is in the word but not in position 5 (which is redundant since we already know it’s in 4), but it also tells us U is not in the word.

So the pattern is now:
1: not G, and not any eliminated letters
2: R
3: O
4: N
5: not N, not U, not any other eliminated letters

Eliminated letters so far: A, S, E, F, T, C, Y, U

Remaining letters for position 1 and 5: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Z, plus vowels I and maybe O (but O is already used in position 3)

We need a valid 5-letter word with:
- R in position 2
- O in position 3
- N in position 4
- G must appear somewhere (from feedback G(-)), but not in position 1
- No A, S, E, F, T, C, Y, U

So G must be in position 5 (since position 1 is ruled out).

Thus the word must be: _ R O N G

Looking for valid 5-letter words ending in “-rong”:
- B R O N G → BRONG (not a valid word)
- D R O N G → DRONG (not valid)
- G R O N G → GRONG (not valid)
- H R O N G → HRONG (not valid)
- K R O N G → KRONG (not valid)
- L R O N G → LRONG (not valid)
- M R O N G → MRONG (not valid)
- P R O N G → PRONG (valid word!)

PRONG is a valid 5-letter word (a type of bread or a verb meaning to prick). It uses P in position 1, R in 2, O in 3, N in 4, G in 5, none of which are eliminated.

Let’s verify:
- P: new letter, not eliminated
- R: confirmed in position 2
- O: confirmed in position 3
- N: confirmed in position 4
- G: confirmed in position 5 (not in position 1, so this fits G(-) from feedback)

This seems perfect.

It uses P in position 1, R in 2, O in 3, N in 4, G in 5, none of which are eliminated.\n\nLet’s verify:\n- P: new letter, not eliminated\n- R: confirmed in position 2\n- O: confirmed in position 3\n- N: confirmed in position 4\n- G: confirmed in position 5 (not in position 1, so this fits G(-) from feedback)\n\nThis seems perfect.\n\n<guess>prong</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: front -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: crony -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(✓) Y(x)\nGuess 4: groun -> FEEDBACK: G(-) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) N(-)\nGuess 5: prong -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(✓) O(✓) N(✓) G(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We now have:

1. Pattern: _ R O N G  (positions 2-5 are fixed as R, O, N, G)
2. Eliminated letters for position 1: A, S, E, F, T, C, Y, U, P
3. Remaining possible first-letter candidates (common): B, D, H, K, L, M, V, W, Z, plus vowel I (if it made it)

Looking for real 5-letter English words that fit B R O N G, D R O N G, H R O N G, etc. – only two common ones:
- B R O N G → BRONG (not valid)
- D R O N G → DRONG (not valid)
- H R O N G → HRONG (not valid)
- L R O N G → LRONG (not valid)
- M R O N G → MRONG (not valid)
- V R O N G → VRONG (not valid)
- W R O N G → WRONG (valid, means “wrong”)
- Z R O N G → ZRONG (not valid)

Only “wrong” (WRONG) is a valid English word here.

So the final candidate is W R O N G.
