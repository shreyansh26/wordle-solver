### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback. Common starting letters in 5-letter words include S, T, R, N, L, and vowels like A, E, I, O, U.

A good first guess should cover a mix of these common consonants and vowels. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly effective because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving us maximum information about potential letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely present: A, O, S
- Letters definitely absent: R, E

We need a 5-letter word that contains A, O, S (each at least once) and does not contain R or E. Also, A cannot be in position 1, O cannot be in position 3, and S cannot be in position 4.

Let’s think of words that fit these constraints. Some possibilities:
- SAO (but this is 3 letters, and we need 5)
- SPOOK (contains S, O, but also P and K; no A)
- STASH (has S, T, A, S, H – contains S twice, A once, but no O)
- SOAP (only 4 letters)
- SAUCY (has S, A, U, C, Y – no O)
- SPOAK (not a valid word)
- STOAK (not valid)
- FOALS (has F, O, A, L, S – contains all required letters and valid positions: A in 3, O in 2, S in 5)

FOALS:
- F (new letter, but not required)
- O (in position 2, which is allowed since O cannot be in position 3)
- A (in position 3, which is allowed since A cannot be in position 1)
- L (new letter)
- S (in position 5, which is allowed since S cannot be in position 4)

This seems like a valid guess that tests new letters while respecting all constraints.

Let’s summarize the accumulated knowledge after the two guesses.

From Guess 1 (arose):
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is NOT in the word.

From Guess 2 (foals):
- F is NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- L is in the word but not in position 4.
- S is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely present: A, O, L, S
- Letters definitely absent: R, E, F
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in 1 or 3
  – O cannot be in 2 or 3
  – S cannot be in 4 or 5
  – L cannot be in 4

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, O, L, S (each at least once) plus one more letter that has not been excluded yet. Available letters (not ruled out): B, C, D, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The simplest structure that satisfies all constraints is to place the known letters in allowed positions and add a common unused consonant. A quick scan of valid 5-letter words gives “COALS”:
- C (new, allowed)
- O (allowed positions: 1, 4, 5; here in 2 → but wait, O cannot be in 2 from foals feedback)
Oops, O cannot be in 2, so COALS is invalid.

Next candidate: “SALON”
- S (allowed positions: 2, 3, 4; here in 1 → allowed)
- A (allowed positions: 2, 4, 5; here in 2 → allowed)
- L (allowed positions: 1, 2, 3, 5; here in 3 → allowed)
- O (allowed positions: 1, 4, 5; here in 4 → allowed)
- N (new, allowed)
