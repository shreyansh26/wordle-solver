For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage of high-frequency letters in both position and presence.

Let me pick one that uses common remaining letters. ""AMONG"" uses M, N, G – all still possible. But I want to test more vowels or common consonants. ""AGONY"" has G, N, Y – also good.

Remaining vowels: U (only one left)

We need a 5-letter word with pattern A _ O _ _ that:
- Does not contain any of the banned letters.
- Contains L somewhere other than position 5.
- Uses only the remaining letters.

Possible positions for L: 2 or 4  
Pattern options:
- A L O _ _  → but we’d need two more letters from the remaining pool.  
- A _ O L _  → and again two more letters.

Let’s brainstorm valid words:
1. A L O _ _ :  
   - ALONE – E is banned → skip  
   - ALOOF – F and F are allowed, but O is already placed at 3, so AL OOF would be A L O O F – double O? Pattern is A _ O _ _, so A L O _ _ would require A L O ? ? → ALONE is the only common word, but E is banned.  
   - ALOUT – not a valid word.

2. A _ O L _ :
   - ADMOL – not a valid word.  
   - AFOUL – F, U, L – all allowed, and U is the remaining vowel.  
     A F O U L → pattern A _ O _ _ with F in 2, U in 4, L in 5. But L cannot be in 5 (feedback says L is in word but wrong position, and in ABOIL it was in 5, so it must be in 2 or 4). So AFOUL is invalid because L is in 5.  
   - AFOUL is invalid → need another.

3. A _ O L _ :
   - A C O L _ – no.  
   - A F O L _ – no.  
   - A L O _ _ – no (L in 2 is fine).  
   - A L O U _ – but pattern is A _ O _ _, so A L O U _ would be A L O U ? → AL O U ? → need a 5-letter word.  
   - ALOUD – A L O U D → pattern matches: A L O U D.  
     Letters: A, L, O, U, D – none are banned.  
     L is in position 2 (allowed).  
     This seems valid.

Let me verify:  
- ALOUD is a valid English word.  
- It fits A _ O _ _ with L in 2, U in 4, D in 5.  
- No banned letters are used.

Therefore, the next logical guess is ALOUD.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage of high-frequency letters in both position and presence.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A is in the correct first position (✓).
- O is in the correct third position (✓).
- R, S, E are not in the word at all (x).

So the pattern is: A _ O _ _

Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, S, E.

I need a 5-letter word that starts with A, has O in the third spot, and doesn’t contain R, S, or E.

Let me brainstorm possibilities:
- A _ O _ _ could be ALOOF (but has F and L)
- AMBIT (but has B and I)
- ANGEL (but has E – already ruled out)
- AFOOT (but has F and T)
- ADORE (but has R – ruled out)
- AGONY (has G, N, Y)
- ALOHA (has L, H)
- AMONG (has M, N, G)

Let me pick one that uses common remaining letters. ""AMONG"" uses M, N, G – all still possible. But I want to test more vowels or common consonants. ""AGONY"" has G, N, Y – also good. 

Between these, I'll choose ""AGONY"" as it tests G, N, Y which are common letters not yet tested.

1. Fixed letters:  
   A _ O _ _  (A is 1st, O is 3rd)

2. Letters already eliminated:  
   R, S, E, G, N, Y

3. Still possible letters (not yet ruled out) for positions 2 and 4-5:  
   Consonants left: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z  
   Vowels left: I, U (since A and O are already placed)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A  
- Has O in the 3rd spot  
- Contains none of R, S, E, G, N, Y  
- Uses only the remaining letters

Possible patterns: A [I/U/B/C/D/F/H/J/K/L/M/P/Q/T/V/W/X/Z] O [I/U/B/C/D/F/H/J/K/L/M/P/Q/T/V/W/X/Z] [I/U/B/C/D/F/H/J/K/L/M/P/Q/T/V/W/X/Z]

Let’s list a few candidates:
- ABOIL – uses B, I, L (all allowed)  
- ACORN – but R is banned → skip  
- ADMIT – uses D, M, I, T (all allowed)  
- AFOUL – uses F, U, L (all allowed)  
- ADOUB – uses D, U, B (all allowed)

Among these, ""ABOIL"" tests B, I, L – all fresh letters. I'll go with that first.

2. A _ O L _ :
   - ADMOL – not a valid word.  
   - AFOUL – F, U, L – all allowed, and U is the remaining vowel.

     Letters: A, L, O, U, D – none are banned.  
     L is in position 2 (allowed).  
     This seems valid.

3. Remaining letters that can still appear anywhere except the already fixed positions:  
   C, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word of the form A L O _ _ using only these remaining letters in positions 4 and 5.

Possible combinations for positions 4 and 5 (from the remaining letters):  
C, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z

Looking for common English words that fit A L O _ _:

- ALONE – E is banned → skip  
- ALOOF – F is allowed, but we need two Fs? ALOOF is A L O O F, but O is already fixed at position 3, so position 4 would be O (allowed) and position 5 F. However, ALOOF uses O twice, but our pattern is A L O _ _ so the fourth letter would be O and fifth F, making the word A L O O F, but that’s six letters. Wait, no, ALOOF is A-L-O-O-F, which is five letters: A, L, O, O, F. That fits A L O _ _ where position 4 is O and position 5 is F. But O is already fixed at position 3, so position 4 can be O (since a letter can appear multiple times). However, we need to check if O is allowed to appear again. The feedback never said O couldn’t appear more than once, so it’s possible.

But let’s see if there’s a simpler word. Another common word is:

- ALONE – E is banned  
- ALOOF – seems valid  
- ALKYM – not a word  
- ALGUM – not a word  
- ALOMA – not a word  
- ALOHA – H is allowed, but A is already fixed at position 1, so A L O H A would be A L O H A – that’s five letters: A, L, O, H, A. That fits A L O _ _ with H in position 4 and A in position 5. But A is already in position 1, and the word would be ALOHA. However, ALOHA is a valid word (meaning “hello” in Hawaiian), and it uses H and A. But A is already fixed at position 1, and the pattern is A L O _ _, so position 5 could be A. But the word ALOHA is A-L-O-H-A, which is five letters: positions 1=A, 2=L, 3=O, 4=H, 5=A. That fits the pattern, and H and A are allowed (A is already known to be in position 1, but can appear again? The rules don’t prevent it. However, ALOHA is a valid word.

But let’s check if ALOHA is allowed given the constraints. The letters used are A, L, O, H, A. None of these are ruled out except A is already confirmed in position 1, and the word is valid. So ALOHA is a possibility.

Another possibility is ALOOF (A-L-O-O-F), but F is allowed and O can appear again.

Between these, ALOHA seems more common, so I’ll go with that.

But wait, let me double-check:  
- ALOHA: A (✓), L (✓), O (✓), H (not ruled out), A (not ruled out).  
  The letters ruled out are: R, S, E, G, N, Y, B, I, U, D. H is not among them, so it’s allowed.  
  The word is valid.

Therefore, the next guess is ALOHA.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage of high-frequency letters in both position and presence.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A is in the correct first position (✓).
- O is in the correct third position (✓).
- R, S, E are not in the word at all (x).

So the pattern is: A _ O _ _

Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, S, E.

I need a 5-letter word that starts with A, has O in the third spot, and doesn’t contain R, S, or E.

Let me brainstorm possibilities:
- A _ O _ _ could be ALOOF (but has F and L)
- AMBIT (but has B and I)
- ANGEL (but has E – already ruled out)
- AFOOT (but has F and T)
- ADORE (but has R – ruled out)
- AGONY (has G, N, Y)
- ALOHA (has L, H)
- AMONG (has M, N, G)

Let me pick one that uses common remaining letters. ""AMONG"" uses M, N, G – all still possible. But I want to test more vowels or common consonants. ""AGONY"" has G, N, Y – also good. 

Between these, I'll choose ""AGONY"" as it tests G, N, Y which are common letters not yet tested.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we know:

1. Fixed letters:  
   A _ O _ _  (A is 1st, O is 3rd)

2. Letters already eliminated:  
   R, S, E, G, N, Y

3. Still possible letters (not yet ruled out) for positions 2 and 4-5:  
   Consonants left: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z  
   Vowels left: I, U (since A and O are already placed)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A  
- Has O in the 3rd spot  
- Contains none of R, S, E, G, N, Y  
- Uses only the remaining letters

Possible patterns: A [I/U/B/C/D/F/H/J/K/L/M/P/Q/T/V/W/X/Z] O [I/U/B/C/D/F/H/J/K/L/M/P/Q/T/V/W/X/Z] [I/U/B/C/D/F/H/J/K/L/M/P/Q/T/V/W/X/Z]

Let’s list a few candidates:
- ABOIL – uses B, I, L (all allowed)  
- ACORN – but R is banned → skip  
- ADMIT – uses D, M, I, T (all allowed)  
- AFOUL – uses F, U, L (all allowed)  
- ADOUB – uses D, U, B (all allowed)

Among these, ""ABOIL"" tests B, I, L – all fresh letters. I'll go with that first.

Guess 3: ABOIL -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) O(✓) I(x) L(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ABOIL we now know:

- A and O remain locked in positions 1 and 3: A _ O _ _
- B and I are NOT in the word (x).
- L is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Letters still ruled out: R, S, E, G, N, Y, B, I  
Letters still possible: C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z  
Vowels already placed: A, O  
Remaining vowels: U (only one left)

We need a 5-letter word with pattern A _ O _ _ that:
- Does not contain any of the banned letters.
- Contains L somewhere other than position 5.
- Uses only the remaining letters.

Possible positions for L: 2 or 4  
Pattern options:
- A L O _ _  → but we’d need two more letters from the remaining pool.  
- A _ O L _  → and again two more letters.

Let’s brainstorm valid words:
1. A L O _ _ :  
   - ALONE – E is banned → skip  
   - ALOOF – F and F are allowed, but O is already placed at 3, so AL OOF would be A L O O F – double O? Pattern is A _ O _ _, so A L O _ _ would require A L O ? ? → ALONE is the only common word, but E is banned.  
   - ALOUT – not a valid word.

2. A _ O L _ :
   - ADMOL – not a valid word.  
   - AFOUL – F, U, L – all allowed, and U is the remaining vowel.  
     A F O U L → pattern A _ O _ _ with F in 2, U in 4, L in 5. But L cannot be in 5 (feedback says L is in word but wrong position, and in ABOIL it was in 5, so it must be in 2 or 4). So AFOUL is invalid because L is in 5.  
   - AFOUL is invalid → need another.

3. A _ O L _ :
   - A C O L _ – no.  
   - A F O L _ – no.  
   - A L O _ _ – no (L in 2 is fine).  
   - A L O U _ – but pattern is A _ O _ _, so A L O U _ would be A L O U ? → AL O U ? → need a 5-letter word.  
   - ALOUD – A L O U D → pattern matches: A L O U D.  
     Letters: A, L, O, U, D – none are banned.  
     L is in position 2 (allowed).  
     This seems valid.

Let me verify:  
- ALOUD is a valid English word.  
- It fits A _ O _ _ with L in 2, U in 4, D in 5.  
- No banned letters are used.  
- L is in position 2 (not 5, so matches ""L is in word but wrong position"" from earlier).

Therefore, the next logical guess is ALOUD.

But O is already fixed at position 3, so position 4 can be O (since a letter can appear multiple times). However, we need to check if O is allowed to appear again. The feedback never said O couldn’t appear more than once, so it’s possible.

- ALOOF – seems valid  
- ALKYM – not a word  
- ALGUM – not a word  
- ALOMA – not a word  
- ALOHA – H is allowed, but A is already fixed at position 1, so A L O H A would be A L O H A – that’s five letters: A, L, O, H, A. That fits A L O _ _ with H in position 4 and A in position 5. But A is already in position 1, and the word would be ALOHA. However, ALOHA is a valid word (meaning “hello” in Hawaiian), and it uses H and A. But A is already fixed at position 1, and the pattern is A L O _ _, so position 5 could be A. But the word ALOHA is A-L-O-H-A, which is five letters: positions 1=A, 2=L, 3=O, 4=H, 5=A.

ALOOF is A L O O F, but O is already fixed at position 3, so position 4 would be O (allowed) and position 5 F. However, ALOOF uses O twice, but our pattern is A L O _ _ so the fourth letter would be O and fifth F, making the word A L O O F, but that’s six letters. Wait, no, ALOOF is A-L-O-O-F, which is five letters: A, L, O, O, F. That fits A L O _ _ where position 4 is O and position 5 is F. But O is already fixed at position 3, so position 4 can be O (since a letter can appear multiple times). However, we need to check if O is allowed to appear again. The feedback never said O couldn’t appear more than once, so it’s possible.\n\nBut let’s see if there’s a simpler word. Another common word is:\n\n- ALONE – E is banned  \n- ALOOF – seems valid  \n- ALKYM – not a word  \n- ALGUM – not a word  \n- ALOMA – not a word  \n- ALOHA – H is allowed, but A is already fixed at position 1, so A L O H A would be A L O H A – that’s five letters: A, L, O, H, A. That fits A L O _ _ with H in position 4 and A in position 5. But A is already in position 1, and the word would be ALOHA. However, ALOHA is a valid word (meaning “hello” in Hawaiian), and it uses H and A. But A is already fixed at position 1, and the pattern is A L O _ _, so position 5 could be A. But the word ALOHA is A-L-O-H-A, which is five letters: positions 1=A, 2=L, 3=O, 4=H, 5=A. That fits the pattern, and H and A are allowed (A is already known to be in position 1, but can appear again? The rules don’t prevent it. However, ALOHA is a valid word.\n\nBut let’s check if ALOHA is allowed given the constraints. The letters used are A, L, O, H, A. None of these are ruled out except A is already confirmed in position 1, and the word is valid. So ALOHA is a possibility.\n\nAnother possibility is ALOOF (A-L-O-O-F), but F is allowed and O can appear again.\n\nBetween these, ALOHA seems more common, so I’ll go with that.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check:  \n- ALOHA: A (✓), L (✓), O (✓), H (not ruled out), A (not ruled out).  \n  The letters ruled out are: R, S, E, G, N, Y, B, I, U, D. H is not among them, so it’s allowed.  \n  The word is valid.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ALOHA.\n\n<guess>ALOHA</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: AGONY -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) G(x) O(✓) N(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: ABOIL -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) O(✓) I(x) L(-)\nGuess 4: ALOUD -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)\nGuess 5: ALOHA -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(✓) O(✓) H(x) A(-)\n'}]","<think>
From the latest feedback on ALOHA we now know:

1. Fixed letters:  
   A(1) L(2) O(3) _ _  

2. Letters ruled out (x):  
   R, S, E, G, N, Y, B, I, U, D, H

3. The final letter A is in the word but in the wrong position (–).  
   Since A is already correctly placed at position 1, this means A cannot appear anywhere else, so the last letter cannot be A.

Remaining letters that can still appear (not yet ruled out):  
C, F, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word of the form A L O _ _ where positions 4 and 5 are filled from the remaining letters and the last letter is not A.

Looking for common English words that fit A L O _ _ with these constraints:

- ALONE – E is banned → skip  
- ALOOF – O is allowed twice, F is allowed → A L O O F (but O is already fixed at position 3, so this would be A L O O F, which is six letters, not five) → actually ALOOF is A-L-O-O-F (five letters: A, L, O, O, F) – but O is already in position 3, so position 4 is O, and position 5 is F. This fits the pattern and uses allowed letters.  
- ALOMA – not a valid word  
- ALONG – N is banned → skip  
- ALOOF seems to be the only common valid word left.

Let me verify:  
- ALOOF: A, L, O, O, F  
  - A, L, O are fixed correctly.  
  - O is allowed to appear again (no restriction).  
  - F is not ruled out.  
  - The word is valid (British informal for ""alone"").

Therefore, the next logical guess is ALOOF.
