Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback. Common starting letters in 5-letter words include S, T, R, N, L, and vowels like A, E, I, O, U.

A good first guess should cover a mix of these common consonants and vowels. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which gives a good balance of information.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) → S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 4).
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, S (but not in positions 1 or 4 respectively).
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and S.
2. Does NOT contain R, O, E.
3. Has A in positions 2-5 (since it’s not in position 1).
4. Has S in positions 1-3 or 5 (since it’s not in position 4).

Common letters left to try: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let’s pick a word that satisfies these constraints and also introduces new common consonants. A good candidate is “SAINT”:
- S is in position 1 (allowed since S wasn’t in position 1 before).
- A is in position 2 (allowed since A wasn’t in position 2 before).
- I, N, T are new letters we haven’t tested yet.
- Doesn’t contain R, O, E.

This should give us more information about A and S’s correct positions and test new letters.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE  
Feedback: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

Guess 2: SAINT  
Feedback: S(-) A(✓) I(x) N(-) T(x)

What we know so far:

Letters in the word (correct or misplaced):  
- A – it is in the word and is in position 2 in SAINT, so its correct position is 2.  
- S – it is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.  
- N – it is in the word but not in position 4.

Letters NOT in the word:  
R, O, E, I, T

So the word has:  
- A fixed in position 2.  
- S somewhere in positions 2, 3, 5 (but 2 is already A, so 3 or 5).  
- N somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 2 is A, so 1, 3, or 5).  
- No R, O, E, I, T.

Remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 2.  
2. Contains both S and N (with the positional constraints above).  
3. Uses only the remaining letters.

Let’s try to construct such a word:

Possible positions:
1: N, B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y  
2: A (fixed)  
3: could be S or N or another letter  
4: not used yet, but we have no info; however we know S and N must appear.  
5: could be S or N or another letter.

We need both S and N. Let’s try to place S in position 3 and N in position 1 or 5, and fill the rest with common letters.

Option 1: N A S _ _  
We need a 5-letter word starting with NAS. Common ones: NASAL, NASHE, NASMY, etc.  
- NASAL: L is unused, but we have no info on L yet. This seems possible.

Option 2: _ A N S _  
We need a word like ?ANS?. Common: BANAL, CANAL, DANSK (but DANSK is not a word), FANSY, GANSY, etc.  
- BANAL: B and L are new letters.

Between these, ""NASAL"" seems like a good test for S in position 3 and introduces L.

But let’s check:  
NASAL:  
- N in position 1 (allowed)  
- A in position 2 (correct)  
- S in position 3 (allowed)  
- A in position 4 (but we know A is only in position 2, so this would be a duplicate A, which is possible, but we have no info on duplicate letters)  
- L in position 5 (new letter)

However, the secret word could have duplicate letters, but we have no evidence for it. Let’s try a word without duplicate letters.

Instead, let’s try ""BANAL"":
B A N A L  
- B: new letter  
- A: correct position 2  
- N: in position 3 (allowed)  
- A: duplicate, but possible  
- L: new letter  

But this has duplicate A, which might not be the case.

Another option: ""CANAL"":
C A N A L  
Same issue with duplicate A.

Alternative: ""DANSE"" – but E is already out.

Alternative: ""FANAL"" – not a word.

Alternative: ""GANSY"" – not common.

Alternative: ""HANSY"" – not common.

Alternative: ""KANAL"" – not common.

Alternative: ""LANSY"" – not common.

Alternative: ""MANLY"":
M A N L Y  
- M: new  
- A: correct position 2  
- N: in position 3 (allowed)  
- L: new  
- Y: new  

This seems like a good candidate as it tests:
- A in position 2 (correct)  
- N in position 3 (allowed)  
- S is not in this word, but we know S must be somewhere, so this is a problem.

Wait, we must include S somewhere. Let’s try to include S.

Let’s try ""SANER"" – but R is out.

""SANCT"" – not a word.

""SANER"" – R is out.

""SNACK"" – K is new, but let’s see:

S N A C K  
- S in position 1 (but S cannot be in position 1, as per feedback) – so invalid.

""SNAIL"" – I is out.

""SNARE"" – R and E are out.

""SNACK"" – same issue with S in position 1.

""ASCAL"" – not a word.

""ANSAS"" – S in position 5, N in position 1, A in position 2 and 4 – but duplicate A and S in 5 might be okay.

But ""ANSAS"" is not a common word.

""ANANS"" – not a word.

""ASANA"" – S in 3, N in 1, but A in 2 and 5 – duplicate A.

""ASNAS"" – not a word.

""ASWAN"" – not a word.

""ANASM"" – not a word.

This is tricky. Let’s try to find a word that:
- Has A in position 2.  
- Contains S in position 3 or 5.  
- Contains N in position 1, 3, or 5 (but not 4).  
- No R, O, E, I, T.

Let’s try ""ANASM"" – not a word.

""ANASW"" – not a word.

""ANASS"" – not a word.

""ANSAS"" – not a standard word.

""ASNAS"" – not a word.

""ASWAN"" – not a word.

""AWANS"" – not a word.

""CANAS"" – not standard.

""CNAS"" – too short.

""DNAS"" – too short.

""FNAS"" – too short.

""GNAS"" – too short.

""HNAS"" – too short.

""KNAS"" – too short.

""LNAS"" – too short.

""MNAS"" – too short.

""PNAS"" – too short.

""YNAS"" – too short.

This seems difficult. Let’s try a different approach.

We know:
- A is in position 2.  
- S must be in position 3 or 5.  
- N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
- No R, O, E, I, T.

Let’s try ""S A N _ _"" – but S is not in position 1.

""S A _ N _"" – S is not in position 1.

""S A _ _ N"" – S is not in position 1.

""N A S _ _"" – N in 1, S in 3.

""N A _ S _"" – N in 1, S in 4 (invalid).

""N A _ _ S"" – N in 1, S in 5.

"" _ A N S _"" – _ in 1, N in 3, S in 4 (invalid).

"" _ A N _ S"" – _ in 1, N in 3, S in 5.

"" _ A S N _"" – _ in 1, S in 3, N in 4 (invalid).

"" _ A S _ N"" – _ in 1, S in 3, N in 5.

"" _ A _ N S"" – _ in 1, N in 4 (invalid), S in 5.

"" _ A _ S N"" – _ in 1, S in 4 (invalid), N in 5.

So possible structures:
1. N A S _ _  
   Need a 5-letter word starting with NAS. Common: NASAL, NASHE, NASMY.  
   - NASAL: L is new, but has duplicate A (positions 2 and 4).  
   - NASHE: H and E; E is out.  
   - NASMY: M and Y are new.

2. N A _ S _  
   Need N A _ S _. Common: N A V S _ – but V is new. N A V S Y – not a word. N A D S _ – not common. N A M S Y – not a word.

3. N A _ _ S  
   Need N A _ _ S. Common: N A V Y S – not a word. N A M Y S – not a word. N A D Y S – not a word.

4. _ A N S _  
   Need _ A N S _. Common: B A N S _ – BANSY not common. C A N S _ – CANSE not a word. D A N S _ – DANSE not a word. F A N S _ – FANSY not common. G A N S _ – GANSY not common. H A N S _ – HANSY not common. K A N S _ – KANSY not common. L A N S _ – LANSY not common. M A N S _ – MANSE not a word. P A N S _ – PANSE not a word. Y A N S _ – YANSY not common.

5. _ A N _ S

H A N A S – HANAS not a word. K A N A S – KANAS not a word. L A N A S – LANAS not a word. M A N A S – MANAS not a word. P A N A S – PANAS not a word. Y A N A S – YANAS not a word.

6. _ A S N _  
   Need _ A S N _. Common: B A S N _ – not a word. C A S N _ – not a word. etc. Doesn’t seem possible.

7. _ A S _ N  
   Need _ A S _ N. Common: B A S A N – not a word. C A S A N – not a word. etc. Doesn’t seem possible.

8. _ A _ N S  
   Need _ A _ N S. Common: B A N A S – not a word. C A N A S – not a word. etc. Doesn’t seem possible.

This is very restrictive. Let’s try to use the duplicate A.

""N A S A L"" – NASAL. Even though it has duplicate A, it’s a valid word and introduces L.

Let’s try ""NASAL"":
N A S A L  
- N in 1 (allowed)  
- A in 2 (correct)  
- S in 3 (allowed)  
- A in 4 (duplicate, but possible)  
- L in 5 (new letter)  

This seems like the most viable option given the constraints.

Alternative with S in 5:
""N A _ _ S"" – but no obvious word.

Another alternative: ""S A N A L"" – but S is not in position 1.

Given the constraints, ""NASAL"" seems the best available.
</think>

Based on the feedback so far, we know:
- A is correctly placed in position 2.
- S must appear somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (since it’s not in 1 or 4).
- N must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5 (since it’s not in 4).
- Letters R, O, E, I, T are not in the word.

A valid word that satisfies these constraints is “NASAL”:
- N in position 1 (allowed)  
- A in position 2 (correct)  
- S in position 3 (allowed)  
- A in position 4 (possible duplicate)  
- L in position 5 (new letter)

<guess>NASAL</guess>",NASAL,"From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE  
Feedback: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

Guess 2: SAINT  
Feedback: S(-) A(✓) I(x) N(-) T(x)

What we know so far:

Letters in the word (correct or misplaced):  
- A – it is in the word and is in position 2 in SAINT, so its correct position is 2.  
- S – it is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.  
- N – it is in the word but not in position 4.

Letters NOT in the word:  
R, O, E, I, T

So the word has:  
- A fixed in position 2.  
- S somewhere in positions 2, 3, 5 (but 2 is already A, so 3 or 5).  
- N somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 2 is A, so 1, 3, or 5).  
- No R, O, E, I, T.

Remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 2.  
2. Contains both S and N (with the positional constraints above).  
3. Uses only the remaining letters.

Let’s try to construct such a word:

Possible positions:
1: N, B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y  
2: A (fixed)  
3: could be S or N or another letter  
4: not used yet, but we have no info; however we know S and N must appear.  
5: could be S or N or another letter.

We need both S and N. Let’s try to place S in position 3 and N in position 1 or 5, and fill the rest with common letters.

Option 1: N A S _ _  
We need a 5-letter word starting with NAS. Common ones: NASAL, NASHE, NASMY, etc.  
- NASAL: L is unused, but we have no info on L yet. This seems possible.

Option 2: _ A N S _  
We need a word like ?ANS?. Common: BANAL, CANAL, DANSK (but DANSK is not a word), FANSY, GANSY, etc.  
- BANAL: B and L are new letters.

Between these, ""NASAL"" seems like a good test for S in position 3 and introduces L.

But let’s check:  
NASAL:  
- N in position 1 (allowed)  
- A in position 2 (correct)  
- S in position 3 (allowed)  
- A in position 4 (but we know A is only in position 2, so this would be a duplicate A, which is possible, but we have no info on duplicate letters)  
- L in position 5 (new letter)

However, the secret word could have duplicate letters, but we have no evidence for it. Let’s try a word without duplicate letters.

Instead, let’s try ""BANAL"":
B A N A L  
- B: new letter  
- A: correct position 2  
- N: in position 3 (allowed)  
- A: duplicate, but possible  
- L: new letter  

But this has duplicate A, which might not be the case.

Another option: ""CANAL"":
C A N A L  
Same issue with duplicate A.

Alternative: ""DANSE"" – but E is already out.

Alternative: ""FANAL"" – not a word.

Alternative: ""GANSY"" – not common.

Alternative: ""HANSY"" – not common.

Alternative: ""KANAL"" – not common.

Alternative: ""LANSY"" – not common.

Alternative: ""MANLY"":
M A N L Y  
- M: new  
- A: correct position 2  
- N: in position 3 (allowed)  
- L: new  
- Y: new  

This seems like a good candidate as it tests:
- A in position 2 (correct)  
- N in position 3 (allowed)  
- S is not in this word, but we know S must be somewhere, so this is a problem.

Wait, we must include S somewhere. Let’s try to include S.

Let’s try ""SANER"" – but R is out.

""SANCT"" – not a word.

""SANER"" – R is out.

""SNACK"" – K is new, but let’s see:

S N A C K  
- S in position 1 (but S cannot be in position 1, as per feedback) – so invalid.

""SNAIL"" – I is out.

""SNARE"" – R and E are out.

""SNACK"" – same issue with S in position 1.

""ASCAL"" – not a word.

""ANSAS"" – S in position 5, N in position 1, A in position 2 and 4 – but duplicate A and S in 5 might be okay.

But ""ANSAS"" is not a common word.

""ANANS"" – not a word.

""ASANA"" – S in 3, N in 1, but A in 2 and 5 – duplicate A.

""ASNAS"" – not a word.

""ASWAN"" – not a word.

""ANASM"" – not a word.

This is tricky. Let’s try to find a word that:
- Has A in position 2.  
- Contains S in position 3 or 5.  
- Contains N in position 1, 3, or 5 (but not 4).  
- No R, O, E, I, T.

Let’s try ""ANASM"" – not a word.

""ANASW"" – not a word.

""ANASS"" – not a word.

""ANSAS"" – not a standard word.

""ASNAS"" – not a word.

""ASWAN"" – not a word.

""AWANS"" – not a word.

""CANAS"" – not standard.

""CNAS"" – too short.

""DNAS"" – too short.

""FNAS"" – too short.

""GNAS"" – too short.

""HNAS"" – too short.

""KNAS"" – too short.

""LNAS"" – too short.

""MNAS"" – too short.

""PNAS"" – too short.

""YNAS"" – too short.

This seems difficult. Let’s try a different approach.

We know:
- A is in position 2.  
- S must be in position 3 or 5.  
- N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
- No R, O, E, I, T.

Let’s try ""S A N _ _"" – but S is not in position 1.

""S A _ N _"" – S is not in position 1.

""S A _ _ N"" – S is not in position 1.

""N A S _ _"" – N in 1, S in 3.

""N A _ S _"" – N in 1, S in 4 (invalid).

""N A _ _ S"" – N in 1, S in 5.

"" _ A N S _"" – _ in 1, N in 3, S in 4 (invalid).

"" _ A N _ S"" – _ in 1, N in 3, S in 5.

"" _ A S N _"" – _ in 1, S in 3, N in 4 (invalid).

"" _ A S _ N"" – _ in 1, S in 3, N in 5.

"" _ A _ N S"" – _ in 1, N in 4 (invalid), S in 5.

"" _ A _ S N"" – _ in 1, S in 4 (invalid), N in 5.

So possible structures:
1. N A S _ _  
   Need a 5-letter word starting with NAS. Common: NASAL, NASHE, NASMY.  
   - NASAL: L is new, but has duplicate A (positions 2 and 4).  
   - NASHE: H and E; E is out.  
   - NASMY: M and Y are new.

2. N A _ S _  
   Need N A _ S _. Common: N A V S _ – but V is new. N A V S Y – not a word. N A D S _ – not common. N A M S Y – not a word.

3. N A _ _ S  
   Need N A _ _ S. Common: N A V Y S – not a word. N A M Y S – not a word. N A D Y S – not a word.

4. _ A N S _  
   Need _ A N S _. Common: B A N S _ – BANSY not common. C A N S _ – CANSE not a word. D A N S _ – DANSE not a word. F A N S _ – FANSY not common. G A N S _ – GANSY not common. H A N S _ – HANSY not common. K A N S _ – KANSY not common. L A N S _ – LANSY not common. M A N S _ – MANSE not a word. P A N S _ – PANSE not a word. Y A N S _ – YANSY not common.

5. _ A N _ S  
   Need _ A N _ S. Common: B A N A S – BANAS not a word. C A N A S – CANAS not a word. D A N A S – DANAS not a word. F A N A S – FANAS not a word. G A N A S – GANAS not a word. H A N A S – HANAS not a word. K A N A S – KANAS not a word. L A N A S – LANAS not a word. M A N A S – MANAS not a word. P A N A S – PANAS not a word. Y A N A S – YANAS not a word.

6. _ A S N _  
   Need _ A S N _. Common: B A S N _ – not a word. C A S N _ – not a word. etc. Doesn’t seem possible.

7. _ A S _ N  
   Need _ A S _ N. Common: B A S A N – not a word. C A S A N – not a word. etc. Doesn’t seem possible.

8. _ A _ N S  
   Need _ A _ N S. Common: B A N A S – not a word. C A N A S – not a word. etc. Doesn’t seem possible.

This is very restrictive. Let’s try to use the duplicate A.

""N A S A L"" – NASAL. Even though it has duplicate A, it’s a valid word and introduces L.

Let’s try ""NASAL"":
N A S A L  
- N in 1 (allowed)  
- A in 2 (correct)  
- S in 3 (allowed)  
- A in 4 (duplicate, but possible)  
- L in 5 (new letter)  

This seems like the most viable option given the constraints.

Alternative with S in 5:
""N A _ _ S"" – but no obvious word.

Another alternative: ""S A N A L"" – but S is not in position 1.

Given the constraints, ""NASAL"" seems the best available.Based on the feedback so far, we know:
- A is correctly placed in position 2.
- S must appear somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (since it’s not in 1 or 4).
- N must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5 (since it’s not in 4).
- Letters R, O, E, I, T are not in the word.

A valid word that satisfies these constraints is “NASAL”:
- N in position 1 (allowed)  
- A in position 2 (correct)  
- S in position 3 (allowed)  
- A in position 4 (possible duplicate)  
- L in position 5 (new letter)",Guess 3: NASAL -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) A(✓) S(✓) A(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
