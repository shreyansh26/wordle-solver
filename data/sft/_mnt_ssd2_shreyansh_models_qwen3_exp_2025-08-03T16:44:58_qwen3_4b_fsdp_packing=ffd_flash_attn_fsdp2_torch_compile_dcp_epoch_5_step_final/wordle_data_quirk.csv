### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-1 consonants, or vice versa, to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

Looking at the most common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This will help identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S, E
- Letter definitely present somewhere else: R (but not in position 2)

To maximize information with the second guess, I should:
1. Avoid A, O, S, E entirely.
2. Include R in a different position (not 2).
3. Use other common letters not yet eliminated.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H
Good remaining vowels: I, U

A strong choice is ""RINCY"":
- Contains R (moved to position 1)
- Includes I and N (common letters)
- Uses C and Y (additional checks)

This should efficiently narrow down possibilities.

Remaining common letters: T, L, D, P, M, H, B, G, K, U, F, V, W, Z, X, Q, J

We know:
- R must be in positions 3, 4, or 5
- I must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (and not 2)

We now have:

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
2. rinCY → R(-) I(-) N(x) C(x) Y(x)
3. flirt → F(x) L(x) I(✓) R(✓) T(x)

From these we can deduce:

Letters definitely absent: A, O, S, E, N, C, Y, F, L, T  
Letters definitely present and in the correct positions: I in position 3, R in position 4.

So the pattern so far is: _ _ I R _

We still need to fill positions 1, 2, and 5 with letters that have not yet been ruled out.  
Available letters (common ones first): B, D, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Z …

We want a word that fits “_ _ I R _” and uses only allowed letters.  
Possible candidates: BRISK, DRIP, GRIM, PRICK, TRICK, …  
But we must avoid any letter already marked ×.

Let’s try GRIM?  → G R I M → only 4 letters, invalid.  
BRISK → B R I S K → S is ×, so skip.  
DRIP → D R I P → 4 letters, invalid.  
PRICK → P R I C K → C is ×, skip.  
TRICK → T is ×, skip.  
GRIMY → Y is ×, skip.  
BRIDE → E is ×, skip.

BRIMS → S is ×, skip.  
DRIPS → S is ×, skip.  
PRIDS → D is allowed, P, R, I, D, S → S ×, skip.  
BRIDS → S ×, skip.  
So far most common 5-letter patterns are being pruned.

Let’s look for a valid pattern more systematically.  
We need: pos 1, pos 2, pos 5 from remaining letters: B, D, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Z …

Try B, D, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Z … in positions 1, 2, 5.

One promising set: B, U, M → B U I R M → “BUIRM” is not a valid English word.  
Try B, U, G → “BUIRG” – invalid.  
Try D, U, M → “DUIRM” – invalid.  
Try P, U, M → “PUIMR” – invalid.  
Try M, U, M → “MUIMR” – invalid.  
Try B, U, G → “BUIRG” – invalid.

We need a valid 5-letter word that matches “_ _ I R _” and uses only allowed letters.

Let me list valid English words fitting “_ _ I R _”:

- BURNT → N is ×, T is ×  
- BURRS → S ×  
- CURRS → S ×, C ×  
- FURRS → F ×  
- GURRS → G, U, R, R, S → S ×  
- HURRS → H, U, R, R, S → S ×  
- LURRS → L ×  
- MURRS → M, U, R, R, S → S ×  
- PURRS → P, U, R, R, S → S ×  
- SUGAR → S ×, U, G, A ×, R → A ×  
- TURRS → T ×  
- WURRS → W, U, R, R, S → S ×  
- YURRS → Y ×

Hmm, most common ones contain banned letters.  
Let’s try less common letters: Z, U, G, etc.

Try Z, U, G → “ZUIRG” – invalid.  
Try K, U, G → “KUIRG” – invalid.  
Try M, U, G → “MUIRG” – invalid.  
Try B, U, G → “BUIRG” – invalid.

Wait, let’s look for a word that uses remaining letters more directly.  
We have:  
pos 1: B, D, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Z  
pos 2: B, D, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Z  
pos 5: B, D, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Z  

A valid word: B, U, M → “BUIRM” – not valid.  
Try B, U, G → “BUIRG” – not valid.  
Try P, U, M → “PUIMR” – not valid.  
Try M, U, M → “MUIMR” – not valid.  
Try D, U, M → “DUIMR” – not valid.  
Try G, U, M → “GUIMR” – not valid.  
Try H, U, M → “HUIMR” – not valid.  
Try K, U, M → “KUIMR” – not valid.  
Try V, U, M → “VUIMR” – not valid.  
Try W, U, M → “WUIMR” – not valid.  
Try Z, U, M → “ZUIMR” – not valid.

This is tricky. Let me list all valid 5-letter English words matching “_ _ I R _” and check which letters are allowed:

1. BURNT – N, T ×  
2. BURRS – S ×  
3. CURRS – C, S ×  
4. FURRS – F, S ×  
5. GURRS – C ×, S ×  
6. HURRS – T ×, S ×  
7. LURRS – L ×  
8. MURRS – N ×, T ×, S ×  
9. PURRS – P, U, R, R, S → S ×  
10. QUIRK – Q, U, I, R, K → Q, U, I, R, K → K is allowed, Q is allowed, U is allowed, I and R are correct.  
    “QUIRK” is a valid 5-letter word.

Check letters:  
Q – not yet ruled out  
U – not yet ruled out  
I – correct in position 3  
R – correct in position 4  
K – not yet ruled out  

So QUIRK is valid.

Therefore, the next guess should be QUIRK.
