### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

The word ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This combination gives me good coverage of likely letters and positions, while also allowing me to test multiple vowels and common consonants at once.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
1. Contains the letter T somewhere, but NOT in the 4th position.
2. Does NOT contain S, L, A, E.
3. All other letters are still possible.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes T (but not in the 4th spot).
- Avoids S, L, A, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants to test: R, N, C, D, P, M, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels to test: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

Let me try a word like ""TRIO"" but it's 4 letters, so I need 5.
""TRIOL"" uses L (invalid).
""POINT"" uses P, O, I, N, T - all valid letters, and T is in the 5th position (not 4th), so it's safe.

Let's carefully parse the new feedback from TINGY:

T(✓)  – T is now known to be in position 1.
I(-)   – I is in the word but NOT in position 2.
N(-)   – N is in the word but NOT in position 3.
G(-)   – G is in the word but NOT in position 4.
Y(-)   – Y is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Combining all constraints so far:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, P, O.
- Letters that MUST be in the word: T, I, N, G, Y.
- Known positions:
  – T must be in position 1.
  – I cannot be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since it was marked wrong in POINT and TINGY). Therefore, I must be in position 1, but position 1 is already T. This is impossible, so I must have made an error.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback for TINGY:
- T(✓) : correct in position 1.
- I(-) : in word, wrong position (not 2).
- N(-) : in word, wrong position (not 3).
- G(-) : in word, wrong position (not 4).
- Y(-) : in word, wrong position (not 5).

So the word is T _ _ _ _, and must contain I, N, G, Y somewhere in positions 2-5, with:
- I not in 2.
- N not in 3.
- G not in 4.
- Y not in 5.

Possible positions:
- I can be in 3, 4, or 5.
- N can be in 2, 4, or 5.
- G can be in 2, 3, or 5.
- Y can be in 2, 3, or 4.

Let's try to place these letters without conflicts. We need to use each of I, N, G, Y exactly once, plus one more letter (since we have 5 positions and 4 letters). The missing letter must be from the remaining unused letters: R, D, C, M, H, B, K, U, etc.

Looking for words of the form T _ _ _ _ that contain I, N, G, Y and one other letter. One such word is TINGY itself, but we already tried it. Another is TIGER, but it doesn't contain N or Y. Let's try to construct:

Possible arrangement:
T _ I N _ (but N would be in 4, which is allowed since N was wrong in 3).
But we also need G and Y. Let's try:
T Y I N G – but this is 5 letters and contains all required letters. Check positions:
- T(1) ✓
- Y(2) – allowed (Y not required in 5, and here it's in 2)
- I(3) – allowed (I not required in 2, and here it's in 3)
- N(4) – allowed (N not required in 3, and here it's in 4)
- G(5) – allowed (G not required in 4, and here it's in 5)

This arrangement satisfies all constraints. The word is T Y I N G, which is valid.
