### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible.

One such word is ""RAISE"" - it contains R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give us good feedback on five different common letters.

The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible.\n\nOne such word is ""RAISE"" - it contains R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give us good feedback on five different common letters.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on RAISE:\n- R is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be in position 1).\n- A is not in the word.\n- I is in the word but in the wrong position (can’t be in position 3).\n- S is not in the word.\n- E is in the word but in the wrong position (can’t be in position 5).\n\nSo the secret word contains R, I, E, but none of A or S.  \nLetters we know are NOT in the word: A, S.  \nLetters we still know nothing about: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need a new 5-letter word that:\n1. Uses only letters we have not ruled out (so no A or S).\n2. Places R, I, E in positions different from their previous positions:\n   - R cannot be in position 1.\n   - I cannot be in position 3.\n   - E cannot be in position 5.\n\nA good candidate is “TIMER”:\n- T, I, M, E, R.\n- It uses no A or S.\n- I is in position 2 (not 3), E is in position 4 (not 5), R is in position 5 (not 1).  \n- It introduces new letters T and M to gather more information.\n\n<guess>TIMER</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: TIMER -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(-) M(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback on TIMER:\n\n- T(x) – T is not in the word.\n- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 2.\n- M(x) – M is not in the word.\n- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 4 (correct).\n- R(✓) – R is in the word and in position 5 (correct).\n\nSo far we know:\nLetters in the word: I, E, R  \nLetters not in the word: A, S, T, M  \nCorrect positions: E in 4, R in 5  \nIncorrect positions for I: 2, 3 (since it was in 3 in RAISE and 2 in TIMER and both were marked “-”).\n\nHence I must be in position 1 or 4 or 5. But 4 and 5 are already taken by E and R, so I must be in position 1.\n\nTherefore the pattern so far is: I _ _ E R\n\nWe need three more letters. These must be from the remaining unused alphabet (excluding A, S, T, M). Good candidates are common letters like N, L, D, C, etc.\n\nLet’s try to pick a common word that fits I _ _ E R. One such word is “INFER”:\n- I N F E R\n- It uses N and F, both of which are new and not yet ruled out.\n- I is in position 1 (which we deduced must be correct).\n- E and R are already confirmed in positions 4 and 5.\n\nThis seems like a solid next guess.\n\n<guess>INFER</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: TIMER -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(-) M(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 3: INFER -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) N(x) F(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
Current confirmed information:
- Word pattern: I _ _ E R  (I in 1, E in 4, R in 5)
- Letters not in the word: A, S, T, M, N, F

We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters not yet ruled out (not A, S, T, M, N, F). Remaining common letters include D, L, C, K, B, G, H, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching I _ _ E R:
- I D L E R → ""IDLER"" (valid word, means someone who idles)
- I C H E R → doesn't seem valid
- I B L E R → doesn't seem valid
- I G L E R → doesn't seem valid
- I D L E R → ""IDLER"" is valid.

Let me check if any letters in IDLER are already ruled out: D, L, E, R. E and R are already confirmed, D and L haven't been used yet. This seems like a good guess.
