### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One of the most optimal starting words according to word frequency analysis is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common vowel

This combination gives us good coverage of likely letters and positions to work with in subsequent guesses.

Current knowledge after three guesses:

Letters known NOT in the word (x):  
S, L, A, E, P, O, I, B, R

Letters known to BE in the word (but wrong positions so far):  
T (✓ in position 5)  
N (-, not in position 4)  
U (-, not in position 3)

So the word ends with T (position 5) and must contain N and U somewhere in positions 1-3 (since positions 4 and 3 have been ruled out for them).

Allowed letters left: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus N and U which we know are present.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with T  
- Uses N and U in positions 1-3  
- Only uses letters from the allowed set

Possible patterns:  
_ _ _ _ T with N and U in the first three spots.

Quick scan of common words fitting this pattern:
- CUT? No, needs N.  
- FUN? No.  
- HUNT? Ends with T, has U and N in positions 2-3, but H is allowed.  
  HUNT → H (allowed), U (allowed), N (allowed), T (fixed in 4th, but we need T in 5th). Doesn’t fit.

Wait: must be _ _ _ _ T, so N and U must occupy positions 1-3, and position 4 is the remaining letter (must be allowed).

Try:  
UNC? No, not a word.  
UNT? No.  
FUN? No.  
HUNT? Ends with T, but pattern is _ _ _ _ T, so HUNT would be H U N T, which is 4 letters, not 5.

Oops, I miscounted. The pattern is positions 1-5, with position 5 fixed as T. So we need:
1 2 3 4 5 = _ _ _ _ T

Letters 1-3 must include N and U, and letter 4 can be any remaining allowed letter (C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Possible words:
- U N C T? No.  
- N U N T? No.  
- U N C T? Not valid.  
- H U N T? 4 letters.

Wait, let’s list 5-letter words ending with T that contain both N and U in positions 1-3.

Example:  
- U N C T? Not a word.  
- F U N G T? No.  
- C U N T? 4 letters.

Hmm, let’s think systematically. The word is _ _ _ _ T, contains N and U in 1-3, and one more letter from C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try:  
- U N C T? Not valid.  
- N U C T? Not valid.  
- C U N T? 4 letters.  
- H U N T? 4 letters.

Wait, let’s check:  
Is there a 5-letter word ending with T that has N and U in positions 1-3?  
Yes: “UNTIL” ends with L, not T.  
“UNCUT” ends with T, but has U N C U T → U in 2, N in 3, C in 4, U in 5, T in 6 → no, 5 letters only.

Wait, let’s list possible combinations:

Positions:  
1 2 3 4 5 = T  
Letters 1-3 must include N and U, and one more letter from remaining allowed.

Possible patterns:  
U N ? ? T  
N U ? ? T  
U ? N ? T  
N ? U ? T  
etc., but must be valid word.

Valid word that fits:  
“UNTIL” is 5 letters, ends with L, not T.  
“UNCUT” is 5 letters, ends with T, and has U N C U T → U in 2, N in 3, C in 4, T in 5. This fits all constraints!

Check letters:  
U (allowed), N (allowed), C (allowed), U (allowed), T (fixed in 5).  
No banned letters.

Therefore, the best next guess is UN CUT → “UNCUT”.
