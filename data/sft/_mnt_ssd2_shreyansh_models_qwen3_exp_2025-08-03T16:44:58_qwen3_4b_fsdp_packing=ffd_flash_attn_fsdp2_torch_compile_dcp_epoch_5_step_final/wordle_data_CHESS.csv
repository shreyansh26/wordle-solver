For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage of high-frequency letters in both position and presence.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the correct position (last letter).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word ends with S.
2. The word contains E somewhere, but not in the 5th position (since E was marked “-” in AROSE).
3. Letters to avoid: A, R, O.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, containing E somewhere in positions 1-4, and using only letters not ruled out (i.e., not A, R, O).

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out, and E is confirmed present)

I’ll try to place E in a new spot while introducing new common letters. A good candidate is “UNTIE” but it ends with E, which is disallowed. Another candidate is “UNTIL” but it lacks E. I need a word ending in S with E somewhere else.

“UNTIE” is invalid (ends with E).  
“UNTIL” lacks E.  
“STEEL” ends with L, not S.  
“THEES” ends with S but has E in 4th spot. However, T, H are new letters.

Let me pick “THEES”:  
- Ends with S (✓).  
- Contains E in 4th position (new position).  
- Uses new letters T, H.  

But “THEES” has two Es, one of which is in the correct spot (5th), but feedback said E is in the word but wrong position (so only one E exists). Thus “THEES” is invalid (double E).

Better word: “UNTIE” is invalid (ends with E).  
“STEEL” invalid (ends with L).  
“CHESS” invalid (ends with S but has E in 4th, but also contains S in 1st and 4th, which might be okay? Wait, no, the word must be 5 letters ending with S, with E somewhere else.

“CHESS” ends with S, has E in 3rd position, and uses C, H, S. But S is already in 5th, so duplicate S – but words can have repeated letters. However, the feedback on AROSE only ruled out A, R, O, and showed S is in correct 5th spot. So “CHESS” is possible: C H E S S. But we’d have S in 1st and 5th, which might be okay.

But to maximize new letters, let’s try “UNTIE” is invalid.  
“UNTIL” lacks E.  
“UNTIE” ends with E.  

Another candidate: “UNTIE” is invalid.  
“UNTIL” lacks E.  
“UNTIE” ends with E.  

Let me think differently: word must be _ _ _ _ S, contain E in 1-4, and avoid A, R, O.

Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Let’s try E in 2nd position: _ E _ _ S.  
Possible letters: common consonants and I, U.  
Candidate: “BEEPS” – but P is okay. Ends with S, E in 2nd. Uses B, P.  

“BEEPS”:
- Ends with S (✓).  
- E in 2nd position (new position).  
- Uses B, P (new letters).  

This seems valid.

Alternatively, E in 3rd: _ _ E _ S.  
Candidate: “DEEPS” – but P is okay.  

But “DEEPS” has E in 3rd, ends with S. Uses D, P.  

“BEEPS” and “DEEPS” are both valid, but “BEEPS” introduces more varied consonants.

- E is in position 3.  
- S is in position 5.

But “CHESS” has S in position 4, which is fine.

- B(x) → B is not in the word.  
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 2.  
- E(✓) → E is in position 3.  
- P(x) → P is not in the word.  
- S(✓) → S is in position 5 (confirmed again).

So we now know:
1. Word ends with S (position 5).  
2. Word has E in position 3.  
3. Letters not in the word: A, R, O, B, P.  
4. Still need to use only valid letters (avoiding the five ruled out).

Current skeleton: _ _ E _ S  
We need two new consonants and one new vowel (but vowels left are I, U, and possibly Y).

Let’s try common consonants in positions 1, 2, and 4, while avoiding B, P, and any already ruled out.

Possible letters for positions 1, 2, 4: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick a word that fits the pattern and introduces new common letters.  
A good candidate is “CHESS”:
- C, H are new.  
- E is in position 3.  
- S is in position 5.  
- Avoids all ruled-out letters.

But “CHESS” has S in position 4, which is fine.  

However, the word must be 5 letters ending with S, with E in position 3.  
“CHESS” is C H E S S – this fits perfectly.

Let’s go with “CHESS”.",Guess 3: CHESS -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) E(✓) S(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
