For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word typically includes a mix of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel in English

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters and positions to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:

2. Introduces other common letters not yet tested
3. Avoids S, A, T, E

- H: Common untested consonant
- I: Common untested vowel
- L: Known to be in the word (but in position 4, so not position 2)
- D: Common untested consonant

This tests several new letters while respecting the constraints.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
   – L is in the word but not in position 2.

2. CHILD → C(x) H(x) I(x) L(-) D(-)  
   – L is still “in word, wrong spot” (position 4 instead of 2)  
   – D is now confirmed to be in the word (✓) but in the wrong position (position 5 instead of 4).

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T, E, C, H, I  
- Letters confirmed to be in the word: L (not in 2 or 4), D (not in 5)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both L and D  
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 4  
- D cannot be in position 5  
- Uses only letters we haven’t ruled out (no S, A, T, E, C, H, I)

Good remaining letters: B, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick a word that places L and D in allowed spots and tests other common letters.  
A good candidate is “FLOND”:
- F: new letter  
- L: allowed in position 2 (since it’s only forbidden in 2 and 4)  
- O: new letter  
- N: new letter  
- D: allowed in position 5 (since it’s only forbidden in 5) → wait, no, D is confirmed to be in the word but not in position 5, so position 5 is invalid for D.  
We must place D elsewhere.

Try “GLOND” – but “GLOND” isn’t a valid English word.

Try “MODEL”:
- M, O, D, E, L – but E is already ruled out.

Try “BLOD” – 4 letters.

Try “FOLLY” – no D.

Try “BLOOD” – has two O’s and D in position 5 (invalid).

Try “GUILD” – I is ruled out.

Try “BLOND” → D must be in 5, but D cannot be in 5. So invalid.

Try “BLOOM” – no D.

Try “GLOOM” – no D.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word typically includes a mix of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel in English

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters and positions to test against the secret word.

1. Keeps the known L (but not in position 2)
2. Introduces other common letters not yet tested
3. Avoids S, A, T, E

Good letters to test next: R, O, I, N, C, U, M, D, etc.

A balanced choice is ""CHILD"":
- C: Common untested consonant
- H: Common untested consonant
- I: Common untested vowel
- L: Known to be in the word (but in position 4, so not position 2)
- D: Common untested consonant

This tests several new letters while respecting the constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CHILD -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(x) L(-) D(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
   – L is in the word but not in position 2.

2. CHILD → C(x) H(x) I(x) L(-) D(-)  
   – L is still “in word, wrong spot” (position 4 instead of 2)  
   – D is now confirmed to be in the word (✓) but in the wrong position (position 5 instead of 4).

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T, E, C, H, I  
- Letters confirmed to be in the word: L (not in 2 or 4), D (not in 5)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both L and D  
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 4  
- D cannot be in position 5  
- Uses only letters we haven’t ruled out (no S, A, T, E, C, H, I)

Good remaining letters: B, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick a word that places L and D in allowed spots and tests other common letters.  
A good candidate is “FLOND”:
- F: new letter  
- L: allowed in position 2 (since it’s only forbidden in 2 and 4)  
- O: new letter  
- N: new letter  
- D: allowed in position 5 (since it’s only forbidden in 5) → wait, no, D is confirmed to be in the word but not in position 5, so position 5 is invalid for D.  
We must place D elsewhere.

Try “GLOND” – but “GLOND” isn’t a valid English word.

Try “MODEL”:
- M, O, D, E, L – but E is already ruled out.

Try “BLOD” – 4 letters.

Try “FOLLY” – no D.

Try “BLOOD” – has two O’s and D in position 5 (invalid).

Try “GUILD” – I is ruled out.

Try “GLOOM” – no D.

Try “PLOND” – not a word.

Try “FROND”:
- F, R, O, N, D – no L. We need L.

Try “CLOND” – C is ruled out.

Try “PLUMB” – no D.

Try “GUILD” – I is ruled out.

Try “BULGE” – E ruled out.

Try “GULCH” – I, C, H ruled out.

Try “FLUNG” – no D.

Try “PLUNG” – no D.

Try “BLOND”:
- B, L, O, N, D – positions: L in 2 (allowed, since only 2 and 4 are forbidden for L), D in 5 (forbidden). So D must be moved.

Try “BLOND” → D must be in 5, but D cannot be in 5. So invalid.

Try “BLOOM” – no D.

Try “GLOOM” – no D.

Try “MODEL” – E ruled out.

Try “BLOOD” – D in 5 ruled out.

Try “GROUT” – no L.

Try “GROIN” – no D.

Try “PLANK” – no D.

Try “PLANK” – no D.

Try “CLANK” – C ruled out.

Try “BLANK” – no D.

Try “PLANK” – no D.

Try “FLANK” – no D.

Try “GLOAM” – no D.

Try “GLOAM” – not a word.

Try “GLOAM” – not valid.

Try “GLOAM” – not valid.

Try “GLOAM” – not valid.

Try “GLOAM” – not valid.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words with L and D, avoiding ruled-out letters and forbidden positions.

Valid English words with L and D, avoiding S, A, T, E, C, H, I, and with L not in 2 or 4, D not in 5.

Remaining letters: B, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Valid words:
- D must be in 1, 3, or 4
- L must be in 1, 3, or 5 (since 2 and 4 are forbidden)

Try D in 1:
D _ _ _ _ : Need L in 3 or 5. D L _ _ _ or D _ _ L _ or D _ _ _ L.

- D L _ _ _ : DL is start, but need valid word. DL is not a start for common words.
- D _ _ L _ : Example: D U L L Y – but Y may be ok. DULLY – valid word. Letters: D, U, L, L, Y. L in 3, D in 1. No ruled-out letters. Let’s test DULLY.

Check letters: D, U, L, L, Y – all allowed, no S, A, T, E, C, H, I. L is in 3 (allowed), D is in 1 (allowed). Looks good.

So the next guess is DULLY.

Current knowledge:

Letters **confirmed** to be in the word:
- L (now known to be in position 3)
- D (but not in position 1 or 5)
- Y (now known to be in position 5)

Letters **eliminated** from appearing anywhere:
S, A, T, E, C, H, I, U

Known pattern so far:
_ _ L _ Y

Remaining unused letters (all others):
B, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Z

D must fit in one of the remaining open spots (positions 1, 2, or 4), but we know:
- D is NOT in position 1 (from CHILD feedback: D was marked “-” in position 5, but we just learned D is in the word, so it must appear somewhere else)
Wait, no: the CHILD feedback said D(-), meaning D is in the word but NOT in position 5. The DULLY feedback said D(-), meaning D is in the word but NOT in position 1. So D must be in position 2 or 4.

So possible patterns:
- _ D L _ Y
- _ _ L D Y

We need to pick a valid 5-letter word that fits one of these patterns, using only the remaining letters.

Check pattern _ D L _ Y:
Need a letter for position 1 and 4, from B, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Z.

Possible words:
- B D L O Y – “BDLOY” – not a word
- F D L O Y – “FDLOY” – not a word
- G D L O Y – “GDLOY” – not a word
- M D L O Y – “MDLOY” – not a word
- N D L O Y – “NDLOY” – not a word
- R D L O Y – “RDLOY” – not a word
- V D L O Y – “VDLOY” – not a word
- W D L O Y – “WDLOY” – not a word

Check pattern _ _ L D Y:
Need letters for positions 1 and 2 from remaining letters.

Possible words:
- B O L D Y – “BOL DY” – BOLDY is not a standard word
- F O L D Y – “FOL DY” – FOL DY is not standard
- M O L D Y – “MOL DY” – MOLDY is a valid word
- N O L D Y – “NOL DY” – NOLDY is not standard
- R O L D Y – “ROL DY” – ROLDY is not standard
- G O L D Y – “GOL DY” – GOL DY is not standard

The only valid word found is **MOLDY**.

Check constraints:
- M, O, L, D, Y – all allowed letters
- L is in position 3 (✓)
- D is in position 4 (allowed, since D is not forbidden in 4)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)
- No eliminated letters used

Thus, the next logical guess is MOLDY.
