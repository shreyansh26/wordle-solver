### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible. ""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (R, A, I, S, E) in strategic positions. This will help narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

Letters we know are in the word: A and E (somewhere other than positions 2 and 5 respectively).
Letters we know are out: R, I, S.

I need a word that:
1. Contains both A and E.
2. Does not place A in position 2.
3. Does not place E in position 5.
4. Does not contain R, I, or S.
5. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, N, L, C, O, U, D, G, H, etc.

Let me try ""OCEAN"":
- Contains A (not in position 2) and E (not in position 5).
- Does not contain R, I, or S.
- Uses common letters O, C, N.

But wait, ""OCEAN"" has A in position 4, which is allowed since the feedback only said A is not in position 2. However, the feedback for RAISE said A is in the word but wrong position (position 2), so any other position is fine.

But ""OCEAN"" has E in position 5, which is exactly the position the feedback said E is NOT in. So this is invalid.

Let me try ""OCEAN"" → E is in position 5, which is invalid.

Next option: ""TREAD"" - but R is out, so invalid.

Next: ""LEANT"":
- Contains A (position 3) and E (position 2).
- Does not contain R, I, S.
- Letters: L, E, A, N, T.

This seems valid:
- A is in position 3 (allowed since it was wrong at position 2).
- E is in position 2 (allowed since it was wrong at position 5).

But I need to check if ""LEANT"" is a valid word - yes, it is.

Another check: no R, I, S in ""LEANT"" - correct.

This seems like a good next guess to test L, N, T positions.
