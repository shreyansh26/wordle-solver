### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should have a mix of these. 

Looking at potential combinations, ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L, A, T, E (all among the most frequent letters)

This will give us good information about several common letters and their positions.

We know:
- S is in the word and in the correct first position.
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like: S _ _ _ _

I need a five-letter word that starts with S and contains none of L, A, T, E.  
I’ll pick a word that uses other common letters not yet ruled out.  
Good remaining consonants: R, N, H, D, C, P, M, B, G, K, F, V, W, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U

A practical word that meets these constraints is “SHIRK”.  
- Starts with S.  
- Contains none of L, A, T, E.  
- Uses common letters H, I, R, K.

This should efficiently narrow down future possibilities.
