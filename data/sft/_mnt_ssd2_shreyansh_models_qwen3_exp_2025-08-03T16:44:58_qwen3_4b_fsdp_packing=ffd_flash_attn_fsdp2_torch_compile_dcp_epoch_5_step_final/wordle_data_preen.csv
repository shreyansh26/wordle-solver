### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage of high-frequency letters in both position and presence.

Summary of what we now know:
1. Pattern: _ R E _ _
2. Letters that exist in the word: R (position 2), E (position 3), N (somewhere, but not in position 4)
3. Letters that do NOT exist in the word: A, O, S, T, D

So far the word looks like: _ R E _ _ and must also contain N somewhere other than position 4.

Letters still available (avoiding A, O, S, T, D): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need:
- Position 1: any letter except R, E, N (since N could be in 1, 2, 3, or 5, but 2 is R and 3 is E)
- Position 4: any letter except N (since N is not in position 4)
- Position 5: any letter except N (since N is not in position 4, and we haven't ruled out 5 yet)

But we also know N is in the word, so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (since 2 is R and 3 is E).

Let's try to place N in position 1:
N R E _ _

Now we need a letter for position 4 and 5, avoiding any ruled-out letters (A, O, S, T, D) and ensuring N is only used once.

Possible letters for position 4: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible letters for position 5: same list, but we can reuse letters unless they're ruled out (we haven't ruled out any repeats).

A good candidate is ""NREPL"" but that's not a valid English word. Let's try ""NERVE"" - but that has E in position 4 and 5, which might be too restrictive.

Instead, let's try ""CREPE"" - but C is in position 1, which would make the word C R E P E. However, this has E in position 5, which is allowed since N is not in position 5 yet.

But we know N must be in the word, so if we put N in position 1, we can try ""NREPL"" - but as mentioned, that's not a valid word.

Let's try ""PREEN"" - but P is in position 1, E in position 4, N in position 5. This has P, E, E, N, but E is already known to be in position 3, so this might not be optimal.

Better approach: since N must be in the word and not in position 4, let's try N in position 5:
_ R E _ N

Now we need letters for positions 1 and 4, avoiding ruled-out letters (A, O, S, T, D) and ensuring valid English.

Possible letters for position 1: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but N is already in 5, so we can use N again if word allows, but likely not)
Possible letters for position 4: same list, excluding any used in position 1.

Valid words fitting _ R E _ N:
- B R E E N (but E is already in position 3, so this would be B R E E N - but that's valid)
- C R E E N (C R E E N is valid)
- F R E E N (F R E E N is valid)
- G R E E N (G R E E N is valid - ""green"" without the G)
- H R E E N (H R E E N is valid)
- M R E E N (M R E E N is valid)

""GREEN"" is a valid word, fits _ R E E N, and uses G which hasn't been ruled out.

So let's try ""GREEN"":
G R E E N
- G: new letter, not ruled out
- R: position 2 (correct)
- E: position 3 (correct)
- E: position 4 (new position for E - allowed since E is in word but not necessarily only in position 5)
- N: position 5 (new position for N - allowed since N is in word but not necessarily in position 4)

This seems like a good next guess.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E).

Summary of what we now know:
1. Pattern: _ R E _ _
2. Letters that exist in the word: R (position 2), E (position 3), N (somewhere, but not in position 4)
3. Letters that do NOT exist in the word: A, O, S, T, D

So far the word looks like: _ R E _ _ and must also contain N somewhere other than position 4.

Letters still available (avoiding A, O, S, T, D): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need:
- Position 1: any letter except R, E, N (since N could be in 1, 2, 3, or 5, but 2 is R and 3 is E)
- Position 4: any letter except N (since N is not in position 4)
- Position 5: any letter except N (since N is not in position 4, and we haven't ruled out 5 yet)

But we also know N is in the word, so it must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (since 2 is R and 3 is E).

Let's try to place N in position 1:
N R E _ _

Now we need a letter for position 4 and 5, avoiding any ruled-out letters (A, O, S, T, D) and ensuring N is only used once.

Possible letters for position 4: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible letters for position 5: same list, but we can reuse letters unless they're ruled out (we haven't ruled out any repeats).

A good candidate is ""NREPL"" but that's not a valid English word. Let's try ""NERVE"" - but that has E in position 4 and 5, which might be too restrictive.

Instead, let's try ""CREPE"" - but C is in position 1, which would make the word C R E P E. However, this has E in position 5, which is allowed since N is not in position 5 yet.

But we know N must be in the word, so if we put N in position 1, we can try ""NREPL"" - but as mentioned, that's not a valid word.

Let's try ""PREEN"" - but P is in position 1, E in position 4, N in position 5. This has P, E, E, N, but E is already known to be in position 3, so this might not be optimal.

Better approach: since N must be in the word and not in position 4, let's try N in position 5:
_ R E _ N

Now we need letters for positions 1 and 4, avoiding ruled-out letters (A, O, S, T, D) and ensuring valid English.

Possible letters for position 1: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but N is already in 5, so we can use N again if word allows, but likely not)
Possible letters for position 4: same list, excluding any used in position 1.

Valid words fitting _ R E _ N:
- B R E E N (but E is already in position 3, so this would be B R E E N - but that's valid)
- C R E E N (C R E E N is valid)
- F R E E N (F R E E N is valid)
- G R E E N (G R E E N is valid - ""green"" without the G)
- H R E E N (H R E E N is valid)
- M R E E N (M R E E N is valid)

""GREEN"" is a valid word, fits _ R E E N, and uses G which hasn't been ruled out.

So let's try ""GREEN"":
G R E E N
- G: new letter, not ruled out
- R: position 2 (correct)
- E: position 3 (correct)
- E: position 4 (new position for E - allowed since E is in word but not necessarily only in position 5)
- N: position 5 (new position for N - allowed since N is in word but not necessarily in position 4)

This seems like a good next guess.

From the feedback on GREEN:
- G(x) → G is not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is in position 2 (confirmed again).
- E(✓) → E is in position 3 (confirmed again).
- E(✓) → second E is in position 4 (confirmed again).
- N(✓) → N is in position 5 (confirmed for the first time).

So the pattern is now completely determined:
Position 1: any letter except A, O, S, T, D, G (and must be valid starting letter)
Position 2: R
Position 3: E
Position 4: E
Position 5: N

Valid English words fitting _ R E E N:
- B R E E N (valid but uncommon)
- C R E E N (valid)
- F R E E N (valid)
- H R E E N (valid)
- M R E E N (valid)
- P R E E N (valid)
- W R E E N (valid)

Among these, ""CREEN"" is the most common (variant spelling of ""creen"" in some dialects, but not standard). The standard word is ""REEN"" (archaic), but not valid in Scrabble. The actual standard word is ""REEN"" (not valid). 

Wait, let's double-check standard 5-letter words ending in ""REEN"":
- ""REEN"" is not a standard English word.
- ""CREEN"" is not standard either.
- ""FREEN"" is not standard.
- ""MREEN"" is not standard.

Hmm, seems like the only valid standard word is ""REEN"" which is actually valid in some dictionaries (as a variant of ""rein""). But ""REEN"" is 5 letters: R E E N, but we need 5 letters with R in 2, E in 3, E in 4, N in 5. That would be _ R E E N.

Looking up valid English words _ R E E N:
- ""BREEN"" - not standard
- ""DREEN"" - not standard (D is already excluded)
- ""FREEN"" - not standard
- ""GREEN"" - already tried
- ""HREEN"" - not standard
- ""KREEN"" - not standard
- ""LREEN"" - not standard
- ""MREEN"" - not standard
- ""PREEN"" - valid! P R E E N

""PREEN"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning to groom or adjust one's appearance carefully. It fits all the constraints:
- P is new and allowed
- R in position 2
- E in position 3
- E in position 4
- N in position 5

This must be the correct word.
