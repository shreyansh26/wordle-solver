For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One of the most common starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good mix of letters to test against the secret word.

All five letters from SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That means I must avoid every one of those letters and still find a valid 5-letter English word.  
Available letters now exclude S, L, A, T, E.  
I need a word that uses only letters from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.  
Common consonants still in play: R, N, C, H, M, D, P, B, G, etc.  
Common vowels still in play: I, O, U (since A and E are out).  
A good next word should use several of these remaining letters to maximize information.  
“CRONY” uses C, R, O, N, Y – all allowed and fairly common.

Current confirmed information:
- Pattern: _ I N Y (positions 2-5 are I, N, Y)
- Letters confirmed absent: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, D, G
- Remaining possible first letters: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z
- Remaining possible letters for positions 1-4: any of the remaining letters except those listed above

We need a 5-letter word that starts with one of the remaining consonants and fits the pattern _ I N Y.  
Possible words:
- B I N Y → ""BINGY"" (but G is already ruled out, so this would be ""BIN Y"" which isn't a word)
- F I N Y → ""FIN Y"" (not a word)
- H I N Y → ""HIN Y"" (not a word)
- K I N Y → ""KIN Y"" (not a word)
- M I N Y → ""MIN Y"" (not a word)
- P I N Y → ""PIN Y"" (not a word)
- V I N Y → ""VIN Y"" (not a word)
- W I N Y → ""WIN Y"" (not a word)

Wait, let me think of actual English words ending in ""IN Y"":
- ""HINNY"" – but that's H I N N Y (double N)
- ""WINCH"" – but ends with CH, not NY
- ""FINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""PINKY"" – ends with K Y, not N Y
- ""LIN Y"" – but L is ruled out
- ""BIN Y"" – doesn't exist
- ""GIN Y"" – G is ruled out

Hmm, actually there aren't many common English words ending in ""IN Y"" with only consonants in the first position. Let me reconsider:
The pattern is _ I N Y, so the word must be [consonant] I N Y. Possible words:
- ""HINNY"" – H I N N Y (double N, but N is already confirmed in position 4, so this would be H I N N Y, but N is in position 4, so this would be H I N N Y – but that's 5 letters with N in positions 3 and 4, which contradicts our confirmed N in position 4)
- ""MIN Y"" – not a word
- ""WIN Y"" – not a word

Wait, let me list all 5-letter words ending in ""IN Y"" with no forbidden letters:
Forbidden letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, D, G
Possible words:
- ""HINNY"" – H I N N Y (but N is in position 4, so this would have N in position 3 and 4, which is impossible)
- ""WINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""PINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""FINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""BINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""PINKY"" – K is allowed, but ends with K Y, not N Y
- ""HINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""WINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""VINYL"" – ends with L, forbidden
- ""MINCY"" – C is forbidden
- ""PINY"" – too short
- ""WIN Y"" – not a word
- ""BIN Y"" – not a word
- ""FIN Y"" – not a word
- ""HIN Y"" – not a word
- ""KIN Y"" – not a word
- ""MIN Y"" – not a word
- ""PIN Y"" – not a word
- ""VIN Y"" – not a word
- ""WIN Y"" – not a word

This suggests that ""HINNY"" might be the only remaining word fitting _ I N Y, but it has N in position 3 and 4, which contradicts our confirmed N in position 4. Therefore, there must be an error in my assumption.

Let me re-examine the feedback:
- Guess 3: D I N G Y → D(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x) Y(✓)
This means:
- Position 1: D is not in the word (x)
- Position 2: I is in the word and in the correct position (✓)
- Position 3: N is in the word and in the correct position (✓)
- Position 4: G is not in the word (x)
- Position 5: Y is in the word and in the correct position (✓)

Therefore, the pattern is: [not D or G] I N Y
We need a 5-letter word that is [consonant] I N Y, with the first letter not D or G, and using only allowed letters.

Possible words:
- B I N Y → ""BIN Y"" (not a word)
- F I N Y → ""FIN Y"" (not a word)
- H I N Y → ""HIN Y"" (not a word)
- J I N Y → ""JIN Y"" (not a word)
- K I N Y → ""KIN Y"" (not a word)
- M I N Y → ""MIN Y"" (not a word)
- P I N Y → ""PIN Y"" (not a word)
- Q I N Y → ""QIN Y"" (not a word)
- U I N Y → ""UIN Y"" (not a word)
- V I N Y → ""VIN Y"" (not a word)
- W I N Y → ""WIN Y"" (not a word)
- X I N Y → ""XIN Y"" (not a word)
- Z I N Y → ""ZIN Y"" (not a word)

This indicates that ""HINNY"" might be the intended word despite the double N, but let me check:
- ""HINNY"" is H I N N Y
- Position 1: H (allowed)
- Position 2: I (✓)
- Position 3: N (✓)
- Position 4: N (not yet ruled out)
- Position 5: Y (✓)

Since N is confirmed in position 4, ""HINNY"" would have N in position 3 and 4, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be no such word, which suggests I might have made an error.

Wait, let me reconsider the pattern:
The feedback shows:
- I is in position 2 (✓)
- N is in position 3 (✓)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)
But it does not explicitly say N is in position 4. Let me re-examine the feedback carefully:

Guess 3: D I N G Y → D(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x) Y(✓)
This means:
- I is in the word and in position 2 (✓)
- N is in the word and in position 3 (✓)
- Y is in the word and in position 5 (✓)
- D and G are not in the word (x)

Therefore, the pattern is: [?] I N [?] Y
Positions 1 and 4 are unknown, but we know:
- Position 1: not D, G, S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O
- Position 4: not G, S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, D

Available letters for position 1: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z
Available letters for position 4: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (since G, S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, D are out)

We need a 5-letter word matching [?] I N [?] Y with valid letters in positions 1 and 4.

Possible words:
- B I N B Y → ""BINBY"" (not a word)
- B I N F Y → ""BINFY"" (not a word)
- B I N H Y → ""BINHY"" (not a word)
- F I N B Y → ""FINBY"" (not a word)
- H I N B Y → ""HINBY"" (not a word)
- K I N B Y → ""KINBY"" (not a word)
- M I N B Y → ""MINBY"" (not a word)
- P I N B Y → ""PINBY"" (not a word)
- V I N B Y → ""VINBY"" (not a word)
- W I N B Y → ""WINBY"" (not a word)

This seems problematic. Let me check if any actual English words fit [?] I N [?] Y with the allowed letters:
- ""HINNY"" – but N is in position 3 and 5, which contradicts our feedback
- ""WINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""PINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""FINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""BINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""PINKY"" – ends with K Y, not N Y
- ""HINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""WINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""VINYL"" – ends with L, forbidden
- ""MINCY"" – C is forbidden
- ""LIN Y"" – L is forbidden
- ""BIN Y"" – not a word
- ""FIN Y"" – not a word
- ""HIN Y"" – not a word
- ""KIN Y"" – not a word
- ""MIN Y"" – not a word
- ""PIN Y"" – not a word
- ""VIN Y"" – not a word
- ""WIN Y"" – not a word

This suggests that ""HINNY"" might be the intended word despite the apparent contradiction, as it's the only remaining plausible word. However, the feedback indicates N is in position 3, not 4. This is confusing.

Upon reflection, the feedback for Guess 3 shows N in position 3 as ✓, meaning N is in the word and in position 3. Therefore, the pattern is [?] I N [?] Y, not [?] I N N Y. This changes things.

Now, we need a 5-letter word matching [?] I N [?] Y with:
- Position 1: not D, G, S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O
- Position 4: not G, S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, D

Available letters for position 1 and 4: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Possible words:
- B I N B Y → ""BINBY"" (not a word)
- B I N F Y → ""BINFY"" (not a word)
- B I N H Y → ""BINHY"" (not a word)
- F I N B Y → ""FINBY"" (not a word)
- H I N B Y → ""HINBY"" (not a word)
- K I N B Y → ""KINBY"" (not a word)
- M I N B Y → ""MINBY"" (not a word)
- P I N B Y → ""PINBY"" (not a word)
- V I N B Y → ""VINBY"" (not a word)
- W I N B Y → ""WINBY"" (not a word)

This indicates no standard English words fit this pattern, suggesting I might have made an error in interpreting the feedback. However, ""HINNY"" is a valid word meaning a young hind, and it fits [?] I N [?] Y with H in position 1 and N in position 4, but this contradicts the feedback showing N in position 3.

Rechecking the feedback:
Guess 3: D I N G Y → D(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x) Y(✓)
This means:
- I is in position 2 (✓)
- N is in position 3 (✓)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)
- D and G are not in the word (x)

Thus, the pattern is: [?] I N [?] Y
And the word must be [consonant] I N [consonant] Y

Possible English words:
- ""HINNY"" – but this is H I N N Y, which has N in position 3 and 4, contradicting the feedback
- ""WINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""PINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""FINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""BINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""PINKY"" – ends with K Y
- ""HINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""WINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""VINYL"" – ends with L
- ""MINCY"" – C is forbidden
- ""LIN Y"" – L is forbidden

This seems impossible with standard words. The only plausible word is ""HINNY"", but it contradicts the feedback. This suggests either:
1. An error in interpreting the feedback
2. The word must be ""HINNY"" despite the apparent contradiction

Given the constraints, ""HINNY"" appears to be the only possible word, so I'll proceed with it.

However, upon further reflection, the feedback is clear: N is in position 3, not 4. Therefore, the pattern is [?] I N [?] Y, and no standard English words fit this except ""HINNY"", which has N in position 4. This indicates a mistake in my earlier assumption.

Let me re-express the pattern correctly:
- Position 2: I (✓)
- Position 3: N (✓)
- Position 5: Y (✓)
Positions 1 and 4 are unknown.

Thus, the word must be: [?] I N [?] Y
With letters not yet used: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Possible English words:
- ""HINNY"" – H I N N Y (but N is in position 3, so this would be H I N N Y – but the second N is in position 4, which is allowed since the feedback only confirms N is in position 3, not necessarily excluding it from position 4)

Therefore, ""HINNY"" is actually valid as it fits [?] I N [?] Y with H in position 1 and N in position 4.

So, the next guess is ""HINNY"".
</think>

Based on the feedback, the pattern is: [?] I N [?] Y  
The only common English word that fits this pattern is ""HINNY"".

<guess>HINNY</guess>",HINNY,"Current confirmed information:
- Pattern: _ I N Y (positions 2-5 are I, N, Y)
- Letters confirmed absent: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, D, G
- Remaining possible first letters: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z
- Remaining possible letters for positions 1-4: any of the remaining letters except those listed above

We need a 5-letter word that starts with one of the remaining consonants and fits the pattern _ I N Y.  
Possible words:
- B I N Y → ""BINGY"" (but G is already ruled out, so this would be ""BIN Y"" which isn't a word)

Wait, let me think of actual English words ending in ""IN Y"":
- ""HINNY"" – but that's H I N N Y (double N)

- ""FINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""PINKY"" – ends with K Y, not N Y
- ""LIN Y"" – but L is ruled out
- ""BIN Y"" – doesn't exist
- ""GIN Y"" – G is ruled out

Hmm, actually there aren't many common English words ending in ""IN Y"" with only consonants in the first position. Let me reconsider:
The pattern is _ I N Y, so the word must be [consonant] I N Y. Possible words:
- ""HINNY"" – H I N N Y (double N, but N is already confirmed in position 4, so this would be H I N N Y, but N is in position 4, so this would be H I N N Y – but that's 5 letters with N in positions 3 and 4, which contradicts our confirmed N in position 4)
- ""MIN Y"" – not a word
- ""WIN Y"" – not a word

Wait, let me list all 5-letter words ending in ""IN Y"" with no forbidden letters:
Forbidden letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, D, G

- ""KIN Y"" – not a word

This suggests that ""HINNY"" might be the only remaining word fitting _ I N Y, but it has N in position 3 and 4, which contradicts our confirmed N in position 4. Therefore, there must be an error in my assumption.

- Guess 3: D I N G Y → D(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x) Y(✓)

- Position 1: D is not in the word (x)
- Position 2: I is in the word and in the correct position (✓)
- Position 3: N is in the word and in the correct position (✓)
- Position 4: G is not in the word (x)
- Position 5: Y is in the word and in the correct position (✓)

Therefore, the pattern is: [not D or G] I N Y
We need a 5-letter word that is [consonant] I N Y, with the first letter not D or G, and using only allowed letters.

Possible words:
- B I N Y → ""BIN Y"" (not a word)

- W I N Y → ""WIN Y"" (not a word)
- X I N Y → ""XIN Y"" (not a word)
- Z I N Y → ""ZIN Y"" (not a word)

This indicates that ""HINNY"" might be the intended word despite the double N, but let me check:
- ""HINNY"" is H I N N Y
- Position 1: H (allowed)
- Position 2: I (✓)
- Position 3: N (✓)
- Position 4: N (not yet ruled out)
- Position 5: Y (✓)

Since N is confirmed in position 4, ""HINNY"" would have N in position 3 and 4, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be no such word, which suggests I might have made an error.

Wait, let me reconsider the pattern:
The feedback shows:
- I is in position 2 (✓)
- N is in position 3 (✓)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)
But it does not explicitly say N is in position 4. Let me re-examine the feedback carefully:

Guess 3: D I N G Y → D(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x) Y(✓)
This means:
- I is in the word and in position 2 (✓)
- N is in the word and in position 3 (✓)
- Y is in the word and in position 5 (✓)
- D and G are not in the word (x)

Therefore, the pattern is: [?] I N [?] Y
Positions 1 and 4 are unknown, but we know:
- Position 1: not D, G, S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O
- Position 4: not G, S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, D

Available letters for position 1: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z
Available letters for position 4: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (since G, S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, D are out)

We need a 5-letter word matching [?] I N [?] Y with valid letters in positions 1 and 4.

Possible words:

- P I N B Y → ""PINBY"" (not a word)
- V I N B Y → ""VINBY"" (not a word)
- W I N B Y → ""WINBY"" (not a word)

This seems problematic. Let me check if any actual English words fit [?] I N [?] Y with the allowed letters:
- ""HINNY"" – but N is in position 3 and 5, which contradicts our feedback
- ""WINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""PINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""FINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""BINGY"" – G is forbidden

- ""WIN Y"" – not a word

This suggests that ""HINNY"" might be the intended word despite the apparent contradiction, as it's the only remaining plausible word. However, the feedback indicates N is in position 3, not 4. This is confusing.

Upon reflection, the feedback for Guess 3 shows N in position 3 as ✓, meaning N is in the word and in position 3. Therefore, the pattern is [?] I N [?] Y, not [?] I N N Y. This changes things.

Now, we need a 5-letter word matching [?] I N [?] Y with:
- Position 1: not D, G, S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O
- Position 4: not G, S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, D

Available letters for position 1 and 4: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Possible words:

This indicates no standard English words fit this pattern, suggesting I might have made an error in interpreting the feedback. However, ""HINNY"" is a valid word meaning a young hind, and it fits [?] I N [?] Y with H in position 1 and N in position 4, but this contradicts the feedback showing N in position 3.

Rechecking the feedback:
Guess 3: D I N G Y → D(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x) Y(✓)
This means:
- I is in position 2 (✓)
- N is in position 3 (✓)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)
- D and G are not in the word (x)

Thus, the pattern is: [?] I N [?] Y
And the word must be [consonant] I N [consonant] Y

Possible English words:
- ""HINNY"" – but this is H I N N Y, which has N in position 3 and 4, contradicting the feedback
- ""WINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""PINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""FINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""BINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""PINKY"" – ends with K Y
- ""HINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""WINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""VINYL"" – ends with L
- ""MINCY"" – C is forbidden
- ""LIN Y"" – L is forbidden

This seems impossible with standard words. The only plausible word is ""HINNY"", but it contradicts the feedback. This suggests either:
1. An error in interpreting the feedback
2. The word must be ""HINNY"" despite the apparent contradiction

Given the constraints, ""HINNY"" appears to be the only possible word, so I'll proceed with it.

However, upon further reflection, the feedback is clear: N is in position 3, not 4. Therefore, the pattern is [?] I N [?] Y, and no standard English words fit this except ""HINNY"", which has N in position 4. This indicates a mistake in my earlier assumption.

Let me re-express the pattern correctly:
- Position 2: I (✓)
- Position 3: N (✓)
- Position 5: Y (✓)
Positions 1 and 4 are unknown.

Thus, the word must be: [?] I N [?] Y
With letters not yet used: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Possible English words:
- ""HINNY"" – H I N N Y (but N is in position 3, so this would be H I N N Y – but the second N is in position 4, which is allowed since the feedback only confirms N is in position 3, not necessarily excluding it from position 4)

Therefore, ""HINNY"" is actually valid as it fits [?] I N [?] Y with H in position 1 and N in position 4.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One of the most common starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good mix of letters to test against the secret word.

All five letters from SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That means I must avoid every one of those letters and still find a valid 5-letter English word.  
Available letters now exclude S, L, A, T, E.  
I need a word that uses only letters from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.  
Common consonants still in play: R, N, C, H, M, D, P, B, G, etc.  
Common vowels still in play: I, O, U (since A and E are out).  
A good next word should use several of these remaining letters to maximize information.  
“CRONY” uses C, R, O, N, Y – all allowed and fairly common.  
Other candidates could be “ROUND”, “CHURN”, “BRICK”, etc., but “CRONY” feels like a balanced choice.

Current constraints:
- Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O
- Letters confirmed present: N, Y (and they are in the correct positions: N is 4th, Y is 5th)
- So the pattern is: _ _ _ N Y
- Remaining usable letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word ending in “-N Y” that uses only the allowed letters.  
Possible consonants for positions 1-3: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, Z  
Possible vowels for positions 1-3: I, U (since A, E, O are out)

Let’s brainstorm words ending in NY:
- “HUNY” is invalid (H, U, N, Y – but needs 5 letters)
- “BIN Y” → “BINGY” (but G is allowed) → “BINGY” uses B, I, N, G, Y – all allowed
- “DINGY” – same letters except D
- “FINGY” – F is allowed
- “HINGY” – H is allowed
- “MIN Y” → “MINCY” (but C is out)
- “PINKY” – P, I, N, K, Y all allowed
- “WINKY” – W, I, N, K, Y allowed
- “DINGY” seems like a good choice (D, I, N, G, Y)

Let’s pick “DINGY” as it uses common letters D, I, N, G, Y.

Current confirmed information:
- Pattern: _ I N Y (positions 2-5 are I, N, Y)
- Letters confirmed absent: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, D, G
- Remaining possible first letters: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z
- Remaining possible letters for positions 1-4: any of the remaining letters except those listed above

We need a 5-letter word that starts with one of the remaining consonants and fits the pattern _ I N Y.  
Possible words:
- B I N Y → ""BINGY"" (but G is already ruled out, so this would be ""BIN Y"" which isn't a word)
- F I N Y → ""FIN Y"" (not a word)
- H I N Y → ""HIN Y"" (not a word)
- K I N Y → ""KIN Y"" (not a word)
- M I N Y → ""MIN Y"" (not a word)
- P I N Y → ""PIN Y"" (not a word)
- V I N Y → ""VIN Y"" (not a word)
- W I N Y → ""WIN Y"" (not a word)

Wait, let me think of actual English words ending in ""IN Y"":
- ""HINNY"" – but that's H I N N Y (double N)
- ""WINCH"" – but ends with CH, not NY
- ""FINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""PINKY"" – ends with K Y, not N Y
- ""LIN Y"" – but L is ruled out
- ""BIN Y"" – doesn't exist
- ""GIN Y"" – G is ruled out

Hmm, actually there aren't many common English words ending in ""IN Y"" with only consonants in the first position. Let me reconsider:
The pattern is _ I N Y, so the word must be [consonant] I N Y. Possible words:
- ""HINNY"" – H I N N Y (double N, but N is already confirmed in position 4, so this would be H I N N Y, but N is in position 4, so this would be H I N N Y – but that's 5 letters with N in positions 3 and 4, which contradicts our confirmed N in position 4)
- ""MIN Y"" – not a word
- ""WIN Y"" – not a word

Wait, let me list all 5-letter words ending in ""IN Y"" with no forbidden letters:
Forbidden letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, D, G
Possible words:
- ""HINNY"" – H I N N Y (but N is in position 4, so this would have N in position 3 and 4, which is impossible)
- ""WINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""PINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""FINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""BINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""PINKY"" – K is allowed, but ends with K Y, not N Y
- ""HINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""WINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""VINYL"" – ends with L, forbidden
- ""MINCY"" – C is forbidden
- ""PINY"" – too short
- ""WIN Y"" – not a word
- ""BIN Y"" – not a word
- ""FIN Y"" – not a word
- ""HIN Y"" – not a word
- ""KIN Y"" – not a word
- ""MIN Y"" – not a word
- ""PIN Y"" – not a word
- ""VIN Y"" – not a word
- ""WIN Y"" – not a word

This suggests that ""HINNY"" might be the only remaining word fitting _ I N Y, but it has N in position 3 and 4, which contradicts our confirmed N in position 4. Therefore, there must be an error in my assumption.

Let me re-examine the feedback:
- Guess 3: D I N G Y → D(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x) Y(✓)
This means:
- Position 1: D is not in the word (x)
- Position 2: I is in the word and in the correct position (✓)
- Position 3: N is in the word and in the correct position (✓)
- Position 4: G is not in the word (x)
- Position 5: Y is in the word and in the correct position (✓)

Therefore, the pattern is: [not D or G] I N Y
We need a 5-letter word that is [consonant] I N Y, with the first letter not D or G, and using only allowed letters.

Possible words:
- B I N Y → ""BIN Y"" (not a word)
- F I N Y → ""FIN Y"" (not a word)
- H I N Y → ""HIN Y"" (not a word)
- J I N Y → ""JIN Y"" (not a word)
- K I N Y → ""KIN Y"" (not a word)
- M I N Y → ""MIN Y"" (not a word)
- P I N Y → ""PIN Y"" (not a word)
- Q I N Y → ""QIN Y"" (not a word)
- U I N Y → ""UIN Y"" (not a word)
- V I N Y → ""VIN Y"" (not a word)
- W I N Y → ""WIN Y"" (not a word)
- X I N Y → ""XIN Y"" (not a word)
- Z I N Y → ""ZIN Y"" (not a word)

This indicates that ""HINNY"" might be the intended word despite the double N, but let me check:
- ""HINNY"" is H I N N Y
- Position 1: H (allowed)
- Position 2: I (✓)
- Position 3: N (✓)
- Position 4: N (not yet ruled out)
- Position 5: Y (✓)

Since N is confirmed in position 4, ""HINNY"" would have N in position 3 and 4, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be no such word, which suggests I might have made an error.

Wait, let me reconsider the pattern:
The feedback shows:
- I is in position 2 (✓)
- N is in position 3 (✓)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)
But it does not explicitly say N is in position 4. Let me re-examine the feedback carefully:

Guess 3: D I N G Y → D(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x) Y(✓)
This means:
- I is in the word and in position 2 (✓)
- N is in the word and in position 3 (✓)
- Y is in the word and in position 5 (✓)
- D and G are not in the word (x)

Therefore, the pattern is: [?] I N [?] Y
Positions 1 and 4 are unknown, but we know:
- Position 1: not D, G, S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O
- Position 4: not G, S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, D

Available letters for position 1: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z
Available letters for position 4: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (since G, S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, D are out)

We need a 5-letter word matching [?] I N [?] Y with valid letters in positions 1 and 4.

Possible words:
- B I N B Y → ""BINBY"" (not a word)
- B I N F Y → ""BINFY"" (not a word)
- B I N H Y → ""BINHY"" (not a word)
- F I N B Y → ""FINBY"" (not a word)
- H I N B Y → ""HINBY"" (not a word)
- K I N B Y → ""KINBY"" (not a word)
- M I N B Y → ""MINBY"" (not a word)
- P I N B Y → ""PINBY"" (not a word)
- V I N B Y → ""VINBY"" (not a word)
- W I N B Y → ""WINBY"" (not a word)

This seems problematic. Let me check if any actual English words fit [?] I N [?] Y with the allowed letters:
- ""HINNY"" – but N is in position 3 and 5, which contradicts our feedback
- ""WINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""PINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""FINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""BINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""PINKY"" – ends with K Y, not N Y
- ""HINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""WINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""VINYL"" – ends with L, forbidden
- ""MINCY"" – C is forbidden
- ""LIN Y"" – L is forbidden
- ""BIN Y"" – not a word
- ""FIN Y"" – not a word
- ""HIN Y"" – not a word
- ""KIN Y"" – not a word
- ""MIN Y"" – not a word
- ""PIN Y"" – not a word
- ""VIN Y"" – not a word
- ""WIN Y"" – not a word

This suggests that ""HINNY"" might be the intended word despite the apparent contradiction, as it's the only remaining plausible word. However, the feedback indicates N is in position 3, not 4. This is confusing.

Upon reflection, the feedback for Guess 3 shows N in position 3 as ✓, meaning N is in the word and in position 3. Therefore, the pattern is [?] I N [?] Y, not [?] I N N Y. This changes things.

Now, we need a 5-letter word matching [?] I N [?] Y with:
- Position 1: not D, G, S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O
- Position 4: not G, S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, D

Available letters for position 1 and 4: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Possible words:
- B I N B Y → ""BINBY"" (not a word)
- B I N F Y → ""BINFY"" (not a word)
- B I N H Y → ""BINHY"" (not a word)
- F I N B Y → ""FINBY"" (not a word)
- H I N B Y → ""HINBY"" (not a word)
- K I N B Y → ""KINBY"" (not a word)
- M I N B Y → ""MINBY"" (not a word)
- P I N B Y → ""PINBY"" (not a word)
- V I N B Y → ""VINBY"" (not a word)
- W I N B Y → ""WINBY"" (not a word)

This indicates no standard English words fit this pattern, suggesting I might have made an error in interpreting the feedback. However, ""HINNY"" is a valid word meaning a young hind, and it fits [?] I N [?] Y with H in position 1 and N in position 4, but this contradicts the feedback showing N in position 3.

Rechecking the feedback:
Guess 3: D I N G Y → D(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x) Y(✓)
This means:
- I is in position 2 (✓)
- N is in position 3 (✓)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)
- D and G are not in the word (x)

Thus, the pattern is: [?] I N [?] Y
And the word must be [consonant] I N [consonant] Y

Possible English words:
- ""HINNY"" – but this is H I N N Y, which has N in position 3 and 4, contradicting the feedback
- ""WINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""PINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""FINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""BINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""PINKY"" – ends with K Y
- ""HINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""WINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""VINYL"" – ends with L
- ""MINCY"" – C is forbidden
- ""LIN Y"" – L is forbidden

This seems impossible with standard words. The only plausible word is ""HINNY"", but it contradicts the feedback. This suggests either:
1. An error in interpreting the feedback
2. The word must be ""HINNY"" despite the apparent contradiction

Given the constraints, ""HINNY"" appears to be the only possible word, so I'll proceed with it.

However, upon further reflection, the feedback is clear: N is in position 3, not 4. Therefore, the pattern is [?] I N [?] Y, and no standard English words fit this except ""HINNY"", which has N in position 4. This indicates a mistake in my earlier assumption.

Let me re-express the pattern correctly:
- Position 2: I (✓)
- Position 3: N (✓)
- Position 5: Y (✓)
Positions 1 and 4 are unknown.

Thus, the word must be: [?] I N [?] Y
With letters not yet used: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Possible English words:
- ""HINNY"" – H I N N Y (but N is in position 3, so this would be H I N N Y – but the second N is in position 4, which is allowed since the feedback only confirms N is in position 3, not necessarily excluding it from position 4)

Therefore, ""HINNY"" is actually valid as it fits [?] I N [?] Y with H in position 1 and N in position 4.

So, the next guess is ""HINNY"".Based on the feedback, the pattern is: [?] I N [?] Y  
The only common English word that fits this pattern is ""HINNY"".

The word must be ""HINNY"" despite the apparent contradiction\n\nGiven the constraints, ""HINNY"" appears to be the only possible word, so I\'ll proceed with it.\n\nHowever, upon further reflection, the feedback is clear: N is in position 3, not 4.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One of the most common starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good mix of letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters from SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That means I must avoid every one of those letters and still find a valid 5-letter English word.  
Available letters now exclude S, L, A, T, E.  
I need a word that uses only letters from the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.  
Common consonants still in play: R, N, C, H, M, D, P, B, G, etc.  
Common vowels still in play: I, O, U (since A and E are out).  
A good next word should use several of these remaining letters to maximize information.  
“CRONY” uses C, R, O, N, Y – all allowed and fairly common.  
Other candidates could be “ROUND”, “CHURN”, “BRICK”, etc., but “CRONY” feels like a balanced choice.

Current constraints:
- Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O
- Letters confirmed present: N, Y (and they are in the correct positions: N is 4th, Y is 5th)
- So the pattern is: _ _ _ N Y
- Remaining usable letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word ending in “-N Y” that uses only the allowed letters.  
Possible consonants for positions 1-3: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, V, W, Z  
Possible vowels for positions 1-3: I, U (since A, E, O are out)

Let’s brainstorm words ending in NY:
- “HUNY” is invalid (H, U, N, Y – but needs 5 letters)
- “BIN Y” → “BINGY” (but G is allowed) → “BINGY” uses B, I, N, G, Y – all allowed
- “DINGY” – same letters except D
- “FINGY” – F is allowed
- “HINGY” – H is allowed
- “MIN Y” → “MINCY” (but C is out)
- “PINKY” – P, I, N, K, Y all allowed
- “WINKY” – W, I, N, K, Y allowed
- “DINGY” seems like a good choice (D, I, N, G, Y)

Let’s pick “DINGY” as it uses common letters D, I, N, G, Y.

Current confirmed information:
- Pattern: _ I N Y (positions 2-5 are I, N, Y)
- Letters confirmed absent: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, D, G
- Remaining possible first letters: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z
- Remaining possible letters for positions 1-4: any of the remaining letters except those listed above

We need a 5-letter word that starts with one of the remaining consonants and fits the pattern _ I N Y.  
Possible words:
- B I N Y → ""BINGY"" (but G is already ruled out, so this would be ""BIN Y"" which isn't a word)
- F I N Y → ""FIN Y"" (not a word)
- H I N Y → ""HIN Y"" (not a word)
- K I N Y → ""KIN Y"" (not a word)
- M I N Y → ""MIN Y"" (not a word)
- P I N Y → ""PIN Y"" (not a word)
- V I N Y → ""VIN Y"" (not a word)
- W I N Y → ""WIN Y"" (not a word)

Wait, let me think of actual English words ending in ""IN Y"":
- ""HINNY"" – but that's H I N N Y (double N)
- ""WINCH"" – but ends with CH, not NY
- ""FINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""PINKY"" – ends with K Y, not N Y
- ""LIN Y"" – but L is ruled out
- ""BIN Y"" – doesn't exist
- ""GIN Y"" – G is ruled out

Hmm, actually there aren't many common English words ending in ""IN Y"" with only consonants in the first position. Let me reconsider:
The pattern is _ I N Y, so the word must be [consonant] I N Y. Possible words:
- ""HINNY"" – H I N N Y (double N, but N is already confirmed in position 4, so this would be H I N N Y, but N is in position 4, so this would be H I N N Y – but that's 5 letters with N in positions 3 and 4, which contradicts our confirmed N in position 4)
- ""MIN Y"" – not a word
- ""WIN Y"" – not a word

Wait, let me list all 5-letter words ending in ""IN Y"" with no forbidden letters:
Forbidden letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, D, G
Possible words:
- ""HINNY"" – H I N N Y (but N is in position 4, so this would have N in position 3 and 4, which is impossible)
- ""WINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""PINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""FINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""BINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""PINKY"" – K is allowed, but ends with K Y, not N Y
- ""HINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""WINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""VINYL"" – ends with L, forbidden
- ""MINCY"" – C is forbidden
- ""PINY"" – too short
- ""WIN Y"" – not a word
- ""BIN Y"" – not a word
- ""FIN Y"" – not a word
- ""HIN Y"" – not a word
- ""KIN Y"" – not a word
- ""MIN Y"" – not a word
- ""PIN Y"" – not a word
- ""VIN Y"" – not a word
- ""WIN Y"" – not a word

This suggests that ""HINNY"" might be the only remaining word fitting _ I N Y, but it has N in position 3 and 4, which contradicts our confirmed N in position 4. Therefore, there must be an error in my assumption.

Let me re-examine the feedback:
- Guess 3: D I N G Y → D(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x) Y(✓)
This means:
- Position 1: D is not in the word (x)
- Position 2: I is in the word and in the correct position (✓)
- Position 3: N is in the word and in the correct position (✓)
- Position 4: G is not in the word (x)
- Position 5: Y is in the word and in the correct position (✓)

Therefore, the pattern is: [not D or G] I N Y
We need a 5-letter word that is [consonant] I N Y, with the first letter not D or G, and using only allowed letters.

Possible words:
- B I N Y → ""BIN Y"" (not a word)
- F I N Y → ""FIN Y"" (not a word)
- H I N Y → ""HIN Y"" (not a word)
- J I N Y → ""JIN Y"" (not a word)
- K I N Y → ""KIN Y"" (not a word)
- M I N Y → ""MIN Y"" (not a word)
- P I N Y → ""PIN Y"" (not a word)
- Q I N Y → ""QIN Y"" (not a word)
- U I N Y → ""UIN Y"" (not a word)
- V I N Y → ""VIN Y"" (not a word)
- W I N Y → ""WIN Y"" (not a word)
- X I N Y → ""XIN Y"" (not a word)
- Z I N Y → ""ZIN Y"" (not a word)

This indicates that ""HINNY"" might be the intended word despite the double N, but let me check:
- ""HINNY"" is H I N N Y
- Position 1: H (allowed)
- Position 2: I (✓)
- Position 3: N (✓)
- Position 4: N (not yet ruled out)
- Position 5: Y (✓)

Since N is confirmed in position 4, ""HINNY"" would have N in position 3 and 4, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be no such word, which suggests I might have made an error.

Wait, let me reconsider the pattern:
The feedback shows:
- I is in position 2 (✓)
- N is in position 3 (✓)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)
But it does not explicitly say N is in position 4. Let me re-examine the feedback carefully:

Guess 3: D I N G Y → D(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x) Y(✓)
This means:
- I is in the word and in position 2 (✓)
- N is in the word and in position 3 (✓)
- Y is in the word and in position 5 (✓)
- D and G are not in the word (x)

Therefore, the pattern is: [?] I N [?] Y
Positions 1 and 4 are unknown, but we know:
- Position 1: not D, G, S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O
- Position 4: not G, S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, D

Available letters for position 1: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z
Available letters for position 4: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (since G, S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, D are out)

We need a 5-letter word matching [?] I N [?] Y with valid letters in positions 1 and 4.

Possible words:
- B I N B Y → ""BINBY"" (not a word)
- B I N F Y → ""BINFY"" (not a word)
- B I N H Y → ""BINHY"" (not a word)
- F I N B Y → ""FINBY"" (not a word)
- H I N B Y → ""HINBY"" (not a word)
- K I N B Y → ""KINBY"" (not a word)
- M I N B Y → ""MINBY"" (not a word)
- P I N B Y → ""PINBY"" (not a word)
- V I N B Y → ""VINBY"" (not a word)
- W I N B Y → ""WINBY"" (not a word)

This seems problematic. Let me check if any actual English words fit [?] I N [?] Y with the allowed letters:
- ""HINNY"" – but N is in position 3 and 5, which contradicts our feedback
- ""WINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""PINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""FINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""BINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""PINKY"" – ends with K Y, not N Y
- ""HINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""WINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""VINYL"" – ends with L, forbidden
- ""MINCY"" – C is forbidden
- ""LIN Y"" – L is forbidden
- ""BIN Y"" – not a word
- ""FIN Y"" – not a word
- ""HIN Y"" – not a word
- ""KIN Y"" – not a word
- ""MIN Y"" – not a word
- ""PIN Y"" – not a word
- ""VIN Y"" – not a word
- ""WIN Y"" – not a word

This suggests that ""HINNY"" might be the intended word despite the apparent contradiction, as it's the only remaining plausible word. However, the feedback indicates N is in position 3, not 4. This is confusing.

Upon reflection, the feedback for Guess 3 shows N in position 3 as ✓, meaning N is in the word and in position 3. Therefore, the pattern is [?] I N [?] Y, not [?] I N N Y. This changes things.

Now, we need a 5-letter word matching [?] I N [?] Y with:
- Position 1: not D, G, S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O
- Position 4: not G, S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O, D

Available letters for position 1 and 4: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Possible words:
- B I N B Y → ""BINBY"" (not a word)
- B I N F Y → ""BINFY"" (not a word)
- B I N H Y → ""BINHY"" (not a word)
- F I N B Y → ""FINBY"" (not a word)
- H I N B Y → ""HINBY"" (not a word)
- K I N B Y → ""KINBY"" (not a word)
- M I N B Y → ""MINBY"" (not a word)
- P I N B Y → ""PINBY"" (not a word)
- V I N B Y → ""VINBY"" (not a word)
- W I N B Y → ""WINBY"" (not a word)

This indicates no standard English words fit this pattern, suggesting I might have made an error in interpreting the feedback. However, ""HINNY"" is a valid word meaning a young hind, and it fits [?] I N [?] Y with H in position 1 and N in position 4, but this contradicts the feedback showing N in position 3.

Rechecking the feedback:
Guess 3: D I N G Y → D(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x) Y(✓)
This means:
- I is in position 2 (✓)
- N is in position 3 (✓)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)
- D and G are not in the word (x)

Thus, the pattern is: [?] I N [?] Y
And the word must be [consonant] I N [consonant] Y

Possible English words:
- ""HINNY"" – but this is H I N N Y, which has N in position 3 and 4, contradicting the feedback
- ""WINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""PINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""FINCH"" – ends with CH
- ""BINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""PINKY"" – ends with K Y
- ""HINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""WINGY"" – G is forbidden
- ""VINYL"" – ends with L
- ""MINCY"" – C is forbidden
- ""LIN Y"" – L is forbidden

This seems impossible with standard words. The only plausible word is ""HINNY"", but it contradicts the feedback. This suggests either:
1. An error in interpreting the feedback
2. The word must be ""HINNY"" despite the apparent contradiction

Given the constraints, ""HINNY"" appears to be the only possible word, so I'll proceed with it.

However, upon further reflection, the feedback is clear: N is in position 3, not 4. Therefore, the pattern is [?] I N [?] Y, and no standard English words fit this except ""HINNY"", which has N in position 4. This indicates a mistake in my earlier assumption.

Let me re-express the pattern correctly:
- Position 2: I (✓)
- Position 3: N (✓)
- Position 5: Y (✓)
Positions 1 and 4 are unknown.

Thus, the word must be: [?] I N [?] Y
With letters not yet used: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Possible English words:
- ""HINNY"" – H I N N Y (but N is in position 3, so this would be H I N N Y – but the second N is in position 4, which is allowed since the feedback only confirms N is in position 3, not necessarily excluding it from position 4)

Therefore, ""HINNY"" is actually valid as it fits [?] I N [?] Y with H in position 1 and N in position 4.

So, the next guess is ""HINNY"".Based on the feedback, the pattern is: [?] I N [?] Y  
The only common English word that fits this pattern is ""HINNY"".

The feedback from Guess 4 (HINNY) shows:
- H(x) – H is NOT in the word.
- I(✓) – I is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- N(✓) – N is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- N(✓) – Second N is also in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- Y(✓) – Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the confirmed pattern is:
_ I N N Y

We need a 5-letter word that starts with a letter other than H, D, G, S, L, A, T, E, C, R, O.

Available first-letter choices (not yet ruled out): B, F, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for real English words ending in “INNY”:
- B I N N Y → “BINNY”  (valid word, informal variant of “bunny”)
- F I N N Y → “FINNY”  (valid word, plural of finch or variant spelling)
- K I N N Y → “KINNY”  (valid word, informal variant of “kenny”)
- M I N N Y → “MINNY”  (valid word, informal variant of “minnie”)
- P I N N Y → “PINNY”  (valid word, informal variant of “penny”)

Any of these could be correct. I’ll choose “MINNY” as it’s a common enough variant and covers the remaining consonants.
