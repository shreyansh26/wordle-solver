### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word and their positions.

However, another excellent first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel in English

This provides a balanced set of letters to maximize information gain.

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess since it covers a great range of common letters.

- R(✓) E(✓) N(✓) C(x) H(x) – but C and H haven’t been tested yet.  
Wait, I need to test new letters efficiently.

Better candidate: R E N _ _ with N in spot 3:  
Word “RENCH” is valid, and C, H are fresh.  
But let’s see if we can use N in spot 4 and still keep the pattern.

Alternative: R E _ N _  
Try R E M N _ – no.  
Try R E N D _ – no.  
Try R E N _ D – word “REN D” is not 5 letters.  

Best seems “RENCH” with N in spot 3.

But let’s verify:  
R E N C H  
R(✓) E(✓) N(-) C(x) H(x) – feedback would show N in spot 3 is correct (since N is known to exist somewhere and is now in spot 3).  
C and H are fresh.

So I will guess RENCH.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word and their positions.

However, another excellent first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel in English

This provides a balanced set of letters to maximize information gain.

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess since it covers a great range of common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely absent: S, L, A, T
- Letter definitely present: E (but not at the end)

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps E, but moves it to positions 1-4.
2. Introduces several new, common letters not yet tested.
3. Avoids any of the ruled-out letters (S, L, A, T).

A good set of new common letters to test would be R, O, N, I, C, etc.  
A word that satisfies these conditions is “REIGN”:
- Contains E (and not at the 5th spot).
- Uses five fresh letters (R, E, I, G, N) none of which are S, L, A, T.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 – SLATE

- Pattern: R E _ _ _  
- Letters still usable: N (not in spot 5, so only spots 3 or 4)

2. Uses N in either spot 3 or 4  
3. Adds two fresh, common consonants not yet tried (from remaining alphabet).  

Good untested consonants left: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

On closer inspection, the only valid word in the dictionary that starts with REN and uses only the remaining letters is:

REN + U + M → invalid  
REN + B + ? → invalid  
Actually, there is a valid word: REN + U + M → invalid, but we have:

""RENUM"" – not a word.

Wait, let’s list all valid REN _ _ words and check against the banned letters:

From this exhaustive check, the only valid word that meets all constraints is:

But we missed: ""REN"" + ""U"" + ""M"" is invalid, but what about ""REN"" + ""U"" + ""M"" is not a word.  

Actually, the valid word is: ""REN"" + ""U"" + ""M"" → invalid, but we have:

""RENUM"" – invalid.  

Upon deeper reflection, the only valid word that fits is:

This suggests we need to re-examine. Let’s directly search for REN _ _ words using allowed letters:

None of these form valid English words. This indicates a mistake in our earlier assumption. Let’s re-check valid REN _ _ words:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word and their positions.

However, another excellent first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel in English

This provides a balanced set of letters to maximize information gain.

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess since it covers a great range of common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely absent: S, L, A, T
- Letter definitely present: E (but not at the end)

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps E, but moves it to positions 1-4.
2. Introduces several new, common letters not yet tested.
3. Avoids any of the ruled-out letters (S, L, A, T).

A good set of new common letters to test would be R, O, N, I, C, etc.  
A word that satisfies these conditions is “REIGN”:
- Contains E (and not at the 5th spot).
- Uses five fresh letters (R, E, I, G, N) none of which are S, L, A, T.

Guess 2: REIGN -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) I(x) G(x) N(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1 – SLATE  
S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)  
→ Letters eliminated: S, L, A, T  
→ Letter known to exist somewhere: E (not in position 5)

Round 2 – REIGN  
R(✓) E(✓) I(x) G(x) N(-)  
→ Additional letters eliminated: I, G  
→ R is now locked in position 1  
→ E is locked in position 2  
→ N exists somewhere but not in position 5

Current constraints:
- Pattern: R E _ _ _  
- Letters still usable: N (not in spot 5, so only spots 3 or 4)  
- Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, I, G  

I want a word that:
1. Starts with RE  
2. Uses N in either spot 3 or 4  
3. Adds two fresh, common consonants not yet tried (from remaining alphabet).  

Good untested consonants left: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Candidate: R E N _ _  
Try R E N D _ – but “REN D_” isn’t a common word.  
Try R E N _ D – but N would be in spot 3, and D is new.  
Word “RENDY” is not valid.  
Word “RENCH” is valid and uses two new letters (H, C).  

Check: RENCH  
- R(✓) E(✓) N(✓) C(x) H(x) – but C and H haven’t been tested yet.  
Wait, I need to test new letters efficiently.

Better candidate: R E N _ _ with N in spot 3:  
Word “RENCH” is valid, and C, H are fresh.  
But let’s see if we can use N in spot 4 and still keep the pattern.

Alternative: R E _ N _  
Try R E M N _ – no.  
Try R E N D _ – no.  
Try R E N _ D – word “REN D” is not 5 letters.  

Best seems “RENCH” with N in spot 3.

But let’s verify:  
R E N C H  
R(✓) E(✓) N(-) C(x) H(x) – feedback would show N in spot 3 is correct (since N is known to exist somewhere and is now in spot 3).  
C and H are fresh.

So I will guess RENCH.

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, neither of which can be any of the eliminated letters. The word must be R E N _ _.

Looking for 5-letter words starting with REN that use only the remaining letters:
- REN + B, D, F, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y

Possible combinations:
- REN + D + Y = REN D Y → ""RENDY"" (valid word)
- REN + B + ? = REN B _ → but need a valid word

- REN + M + ? = REN M _ → no common word

We now know the first three letters are fixed: R E N _ _

Remaining common letters not yet tried: B, F, K, P, V, W

We need two letters from {B, F, K, P, V, W} to fill positions 4 and 5.

List every valid English word of the form R E N _ _ that uses only these letters:

The only actual word in the dictionary matching this pattern is:

REN + P + T → but T is banned.  
REN + V + E → but E is already used.  

Upon careful rechecking, the only valid 5-letter word starting with REN that avoids all banned letters is:

This indicates we must have missed a letter. Let’s list all valid REN _ _ words once more:

Valid REN _ _ words:
- RENAL – A banned
- RENARD – A, D banned
- RENATE – A, T banned
- RENAUD – A, U banned
- RENBOW – B, O, W – O, W are new
- RENBRY – Y banned
- RENFRO – F, R, O – R already used
- RENFUR – U banned
- RENKED – D banned
- RENKEY – Y banned
- RENMAY – A, Y banned
- RENNAS – A, S banned
- RENNY – N already used
