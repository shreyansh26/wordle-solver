For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically include common vowels and consonants. 

Some of the most recommended starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Looking at these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes S, L, A, T, and E - covering several common letters in different positions. This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That eliminates every word that contains any of those letters.  
I need a fresh set of common consonants and vowels that weren’t used yet.

The remaining high-frequency letters are:  
- Vowels: I, O, U  
- Consonants: R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, K, F, P, Y, W, etc.

A good second-guess word should mix these.  
Popular choices after a full sweep are words like:  
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D)  
- CHIMP (C, H, I, M, P)  
- DRINK (D, R, I, N, K)

I’ll pick “ROUND” because it uses three vowels (O, U) and two common consonants (R, N, D), giving broad coverage for the next guess.

We now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D
- Letter O is in the word and in the correct position (2nd spot).

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ _

Remaining useful letters (high-frequency ones not yet ruled out):
Vowels: I, Y (U, E, A, R already excluded)
Consonants: C, H, M, G, B, K, F, P, Y, W, V, D (but D already out), etc.

I want a word that:
1. Has O in the 2nd spot.
2. Uses other remaining high-frequency letters.
3. Doesn’t repeat any letter until necessary.

Good candidates:
- COUGH (C, O, U, G, H) – but U is out.
- BOGGY (B, O, G, G, Y) – double G, but G and Y are still possible.
- FOULY (F, O, U, L, Y) – U and L are out.
- WOVEN (W, O, V, E, N) – E and N are out.
- COMFY (C, O, M, F, Y) – all letters still possible.

COMFY uses C, M, F, Y – none of which have been ruled out – and keeps the O in position 2. It’s a valid, common word.

Another check: no S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D in COMFY. Good.

We now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D, C, M, F
- Letters confirmed to be in the word: O (2nd position), Y (5th position)

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y
Remaining unused high-frequency letters (not yet ruled out):
Vowels: I
Consonants: H, G, B, K, P, V, W, V, etc.

I need a 5-letter word with O in position 2, Y in position 5, and only letters from the remaining pool.  
Possible combinations for positions 1, 3, 4:  
- Position 1: B, G, H, I, K, P, V, W, etc.
- Position 3: B, G, H, I, K, P, V, W, etc.
- Position 4: B, G, H, I, K, P, V, W, etc.

Looking for common words fitting _ O _ _ Y:
- BOGGY – but G is repeated and G hasn’t been ruled out yet.  
- HOIST – but S, T are out.  
- VOKEY – K and V are still possible, but “VOKEY” is not a common word.  
- WOVEN – V, N, E; N and E are out.  
- PIKEY – P, I, K are possible, but “PIKEY” is slang.  
- GOOFY – G, O, O, F, Y – but O is already in position 2, and F is out.  

Wait, let’s list valid letters again:
Allowed letters: B, G, H, I, K, P, V, W, and O, Y.

Looking for common words _ O _ _ Y:
- BOOBY – B, O, O, B, Y – but O is only supposed to appear once (since it’s confirmed in position 2).  
- GOOFY – already saw F is out.  
- HOOBY – H, O, O, B, Y – double O, but no evidence against it.  
- POOBY – P, O, O, B, Y – same double O issue.  
- WOOBY – W, O, O, B, Y – same.

Actually, the only other common word with O in position 2 and Y in position 5 is “GOOFY”, but F is out.  
Another possibility is “HOIST”, but S and T are out.  
“VOGUE” – but U is out.  

Wait, let’s think differently: the letters remaining are B, G, H, I, K, P, V, W, and we need three more letters (positions 1, 3, 4) from these.  
Possible word: “BOGUS” – but S is out.  
“HOGUE” – but E is out.  
“PIVOT” – T is out.  

Hmm, actually, the only common word left seems to be “BOGUS” but S is out.  
Wait, let’s list all possible combinations:

Possible letters for positions 1,3,4: B, G, H, I, K, P, V, W.

Looking for valid English words _ O _ _ Y:

- BOGUS – S out.  
- BOOBY – double O, but O is confirmed only once.  
- GOGGY – G, O, G, G, Y – but G hasn’t been ruled out, and double G is possible.  
  However, G hasn’t been ruled out yet (only C, M, F, etc. have been ruled out).  

So “GOGGY” is a valid word: G, O, G, G, Y.  
Letters used: G (allowed), O (confirmed position 2), G (allowed), G (allowed), Y (confirmed position 5).  

No letters in GOGGY have been ruled out except those already excluded (C, M, F, etc.), and G hasn’t been excluded.  

Thus, GOGGY is a valid guess.

Another candidate: “HOGUE” – but E is out.  
“POGGY” – P, O, G, G, Y – P and G haven’t been ruled out.  
“POGGY” is also a valid word.

Between GOGGY and POGGY, both fit.  
GOGGY uses G four times, which is possible.  
POGGY uses P and G.  

Let me pick GOGGY as it uses G which is still possible.

But wait, let me double-check:  
Letters ruled out so far: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D, C, M, F.  
Letters still possible: B, G, H, I, K, P, V, W, O, Y.  

So GOGGY: G (allowed), O (allowed, position 2), G (allowed), G (allowed), Y (allowed, position 5).  
Valid.

Similarly, POGGY: P (allowed), O (allowed), G (allowed), G (allowed), Y (allowed).  
Valid.

I’ll choose GOGGY as it’s a common word.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically include common vowels and consonants. 

Some of the most recommended starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Looking at these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes S, L, A, T, and E - covering several common letters in different positions. This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That eliminates every word that contains any of those letters.  
I need a fresh set of common consonants and vowels that weren’t used yet.

The remaining high-frequency letters are:  
- Vowels: I, O, U  
- Consonants: R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, K, F, P, Y, W, etc.

A good second-guess word should mix these.  
Popular choices after a full sweep are words like:  
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D)  
- CHIMP (C, H, I, M, P)  
- DRINK (D, R, I, N, K)

I’ll pick “ROUND” because it uses three vowels (O, U) and two common consonants (R, N, D), giving broad coverage for the next guess.

We now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D
- Letter O is in the word and in the correct position (2nd spot).

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ _

Remaining useful letters (high-frequency ones not yet ruled out):
Vowels: I, Y (U, E, A, R already excluded)
Consonants: C, H, M, G, B, K, F, P, Y, W, V, D (but D already out), etc.

I want a word that:
1. Has O in the 2nd spot.
2. Uses other remaining high-frequency letters.
3. Doesn’t repeat any letter until necessary.

Good candidates:
- COUGH (C, O, U, G, H) – but U is out.
- BOGGY (B, O, G, G, Y) – double G, but G and Y are still possible.
- FOULY (F, O, U, L, Y) – U and L are out.
- WOVEN (W, O, V, E, N) – E and N are out.
- COMFY (C, O, M, F, Y) – all letters still possible.

COMFY uses C, M, F, Y – none of which have been ruled out – and keeps the O in position 2. It’s a valid, common word.

Another check: no S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D in COMFY. Good.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically include common vowels and consonants. 

Some of the most recommended starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Looking at these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes S, L, A, T, and E - covering several common letters in different positions. This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That eliminates every word that contains any of those letters.  
I need a fresh set of common consonants and vowels that weren’t used yet.

The remaining high-frequency letters are:  
- Vowels: I, O, U  
- Consonants: R, N, C, H, M, D, G, B, K, F, P, Y, W, etc.

A good second-guess word should mix these.  
Popular choices after a full sweep are words like:  
- ROUND (R, O, U, N, D)  
- CHIMP (C, H, I, M, P)  
- DRINK (D, R, I, N, K)

I’ll pick “ROUND” because it uses three vowels (O, U) and two common consonants (R, N, D), giving broad coverage for the next guess.

We now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D
- Letter O is in the word and in the correct position (2nd spot).

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ _

Remaining useful letters (high-frequency ones not yet ruled out):
Vowels: I, Y (U, E, A, R already excluded)
Consonants: C, H, M, G, B, K, F, P, Y, W, V, D (but D already out), etc.

I want a word that:
1. Has O in the 2nd spot.
2. Uses other remaining high-frequency letters.
3. Doesn’t repeat any letter until necessary.

Good candidates:
- COUGH (C, O, U, G, H) – but U is out.
- BOGGY (B, O, G, G, Y) – double G, but G and Y are still possible.
- FOULY (F, O, U, L, Y) – U and L are out.
- WOVEN (W, O, V, E, N) – E and N are out.
- COMFY (C, O, M, F, Y) – all letters still possible.

COMFY uses C, M, F, Y – none of which have been ruled out – and keeps the O in position 2. It’s a valid, common word.

Another check: no S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D in COMFY. Good.

So COMFY seems like the safest choice here.

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y
Remaining unused high-frequency letters (not yet ruled out):
Vowels: I
Consonants: H, G, B, K, P, V, W, V, etc.

I need a 5-letter word with O in position 2, Y in position 5, and only letters from the remaining pool.  
Possible combinations for positions 1, 3, 4:  
- Position 1: B, G, H, I, K, P, V, W, etc.
- Position 3: B, G, H, I, K, P, V, W, etc.
- Position 4: B, G, H, I, K, P, V, W, etc.

Looking for common words fitting _ O _ _ Y:
- BOGGY – but G is repeated and G hasn’t been ruled out yet.  
- HOIST – but S, T are out.  
- VOKEY – K and V are still possible, but “VOKEY” is not a common word.  
- WOVEN – V, N, E; N and E are out.  
- PIKEY – P, I, K are possible, but “PIKEY” is slang.  
- GOOFY – G, O, O, F, Y – but O is already in position 2, and F is out.  

Wait, let’s list valid letters again:
Allowed letters: B, G, H, I, K, P, V, W, and O, Y.

Looking for common words _ O _ _ Y:
- BOOBY – B, O, O, B, Y – but O is only supposed to appear once (since it’s confirmed in position 2).  
- GOOFY – already saw F is out.  
- HOOBY – H, O, O, B, Y – double O, but no evidence against it.  
- POOBY – P, O, O, B, Y – same double O issue.  
- WOOBY – W, O, O, B, Y – same.

Actually, the only other common word with O in position 2 and Y in position 5 is “GOOFY”, but F is out.  
Another possibility is “HOIST”, but S and T are out.  
“VOGUE” – but U is out.  

Wait, let’s think differently: the letters remaining are B, G, H, I, K, P, V, W, and we need three more letters (positions 1, 3, 4) from these.  
Possible word: “BOGUS” – but S is out.  
“HOGUE” – but E is out.  
“PIVOT” – T is out.  

Hmm, actually, the only common word left seems to be “BOGUS” but S is out.  
Wait, let’s list all possible combinations:

Possible letters for positions 1,3,4: B, G, H, I, K, P, V, W.

Looking for valid English words _ O _ _ Y:

- BOGUS – S out.  
- BOOBY – double O, but O is confirmed only once.  
- GOGGY – G, O, G, G, Y – but G hasn’t been ruled out, and double G is possible.  
  However, G hasn’t been ruled out yet (only C, M, F, etc. have been ruled out).  

So “GOGGY” is a valid word: G, O, G, G, Y.  
Letters used: G (allowed), O (confirmed position 2), G (allowed), G (allowed), Y (confirmed position 5).  

No letters in GOGGY have been ruled out except those already excluded (C, M, F, etc.), and G hasn’t been excluded.  

Thus, GOGGY is a valid guess.

Another candidate: “HOGUE” – but E is out.  
“POGGY” – P, O, G, G, Y – P and G haven’t been ruled out.  
“POGGY” is also a valid word.

Between GOGGY and POGGY, both fit.  
GOGGY uses G four times, which is possible.  
POGGY uses P and G.  

Let me pick GOGGY as it uses G which is still possible.

But wait, let me double-check:  
Letters ruled out so far: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D, C, M, F.  
Letters still possible: B, G, H, I, K, P, V, W, O, Y.  

So GOGGY: G (allowed), O (allowed, position 2), G (allowed), G (allowed), Y (allowed, position 5).  
Valid.

Similarly, POGGY: P (allowed), O (allowed), G (allowed), G (allowed), Y (allowed).  
Valid.

I’ll choose GOGGY as it’s a common word.

We now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D, C, M, F, G, H, B  
- Letters confirmed to be in the word: O (2nd position), Y (5th position)

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y  
Available letters (never yet ruled out): I, K, P, V, W

I need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2  
- Y in position 5  
- Only letters from {I, K, P, V, W}

Possible combinations for positions 1, 3, 4 using these letters:

1. Position 1: I, K, P, V, W  
2. Position 3: I, K, P, V, W  
3. Position 4: I, K, P, V, W  

Looking for common English words fitting _ O _ _ Y:

- VOOIK – not valid.  
- PIKOV – not valid.  
- WIKOV – not valid.  
- VIKPY – not valid.  
- PIKBY – already B is out.  

Actually, the only common word left is “PIVOT”, but T is already out.  
Another possibility is “VOGUE”, but G and U are out.  

Wait, let’s list all valid combinations:

Possible letters: I, K, P, V, W.

Trying to form a valid 5-letter word _ O _ _ Y:

- V O I K Y – “VOIKY” – not valid.  
- P O I K Y – “POIKY” – not valid.  
- W O I K Y – “WOIKY” – not valid.  
- V O K I Y – “VOKIY” – not valid.  
- P O K I Y – “POKIY” – not valid.  
- W O K I Y – “WOKIY” – not valid.  

Hmm, none of these are valid.  
Let me try another approach: look up common 5-letter words with O in position 2 and Y in position 5, excluding all the ruled-out letters.

Common words with O in position 2 and Y in position 5:
- BOOBY – B and O already ruled out.  
- HOBBY – H and B ruled out.  
- GOOFY – G and F ruled out.  
- DOING – D and I, N, G – many ruled out.  
- LOOPY – L and P, Y – L ruled out.  
- MOONY – M and N ruled out.  
- POOCH – P, O, O, C, H – C and H ruled out.  
- ROOKIE – R, O, K, I, E – R, E ruled out.  
- SPOOK – S, P, O, O, K – S, O, K, but O is confirmed in position 2, and we have no evidence against double O.  
  However, S is ruled out.  
- TOXIC – T, O, X, I, C – T and C ruled out.  
- VOGUE – V, O, G, U, E – G, U, E ruled out.  
- WOOZY – W, O, O, Z, Y – Z not yet tested, but O is confirmed in position 2, and we have no evidence against double O.  
  However, Z is not in our available letters (only I, K, P, V, W).  

Wait, the only remaining possibility is double O.  
The word “VOOBY” has double O, but B is ruled out.  
The word “WOOPY” has double O and P, Y – but P is allowed, Y is confirmed.  

“WOOPY” – W, O, O, P, Y.  
Letters used: W (allowed), O (allowed, position 2), O (allowed), P (allowed), Y (allowed, position 5).  
No letters in WOOPY are ruled out except possibly P, but P hasn’t been ruled out.  

Is WOOPY a valid word? Yes, it’s an informal word meaning “woolly” or “mopey”.  

Since all other combinations either use ruled-out letters or aren’t valid words, WOOPY seems to be the only remaining candidate.

However, let me double-check:  
Letters ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, N, D, C, M, F, G, H, B  
Available letters: I, K, P, V, W, plus O and Y (already placed).  

The word WOOPY uses W, O, O, P, Y – all allowed.  
It’s the only common word left fitting the pattern.  

Therefore, I will guess WOOPY.
