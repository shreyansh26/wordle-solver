### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - five of the most common letters. This gives us maximum coverage of the alphabet with our first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x), R(x), O(x), S(x): none of these four letters appear in the secret word.
- E(-): the letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So the secret word:
- Contains E somewhere (but not at the end).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.

We need a word with E (not in position 5), and avoiding A, R, O, S.  
Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.  
Good remaining vowels to try: I, U (since A and O are ruled out).

A strong next guess is ""UNTIE"":
- Contains E (in position 4, so not the forbidden 5th spot).
- Uses U, N, T, I – none of which are A, R, O, S.
- Covers common letters and tests multiple new ones at once.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - five of the most common letters. This gives us maximum coverage of the alphabet with our first guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x), R(x), O(x), S(x): none of these four letters appear in the secret word.
- E(-): the letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So the secret word:
- Contains E somewhere (but not at the end).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.

We need a word with E (not in position 5), and avoiding A, R, O, S.  
Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.  
Good remaining vowels to try: I, U (since A and O are ruled out).

A strong next guess is ""UNTIE"":
- Contains E (in position 4, so not the forbidden 5th spot).
- Uses U, N, T, I – none of which are A, R, O, S.
- Covers common letters and tests multiple new ones at once.

Current constraints:

- Letters confirmed IN the word: T and E  
- Position of T: it is in the 3rd position (✓)  
- Position of E: it is not in the 5th position (–)  

So the pattern so far: _ _ T _ _  
And E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.

Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: only E is still in play (since A, O, I, U are ruled out)

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Has T in position 3.
2. Has E somewhere (positions 1, 2, or 4).
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Possible candidates:
- CREST: C, R, E, S, T – but R and S are already ruled out.
- BLOKE: B, L, O, K, E – O is ruled out.
- METAL: M, E, T, A, L – A is ruled out.

- VETAL: V, E, T, A, L – A is ruled out.
- BETEL: B, E, T, E, L – positions: E in 2 and 4, T in 3. Neither E is in position 5, so this satisfies the constraints.

However, the simplest and most straightforward word that fits _ E T _ _ without repeating letters is ""JETTY"" (J-E-T-T-Y). Although T and E are confirmed once, the game allows multiple instances of these letters if the word itself contains them twice. Since J, T, and Y are all allowed, this is a valid guess.

Another possible word is ""METER"", but R is ruled out. ""VETER"" uses E twice and R is ruled out. ""PETER"" uses R and is invalid. ""WETTE"" uses W and T,E but E is already confirmed once and appears twice in the word, which might be possible but is less likely.

The safest and most informative guess is ""JETTY"" as it tests J and Y while keeping T and E in their confirmed positions.",Guess 5: JETTY -> FEEDBACK: J(✓) E(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
