### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

After considering these, I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

From the two clues we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. LINED → L(-) I(-) N(x) E(-) D(x)
   - L is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 4.
   - I is in the word but not in position 2.
   - N and D are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: L, E, I
- Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T, N, D
- Positions ruled out:
  - L ≠ 1, 2
  - E ≠ 4, 5
  - I ≠ 2

The remaining possible positions for each:
- L can be in 3 or 4 or 5 (but 5 is ruled out for E, so 3 or 4)
- E can be in 1, 2, or 3
- I can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5

We need a 5-letter word that uses exactly the letters L, E, I (each once) and avoids S, A, T, N, D.

Possible candidates:
- E, I, L must appear once each.
- Let's list valid permutations:
  - E I L _ _ : but we need 5 letters, and only have 3.
  - We need to include two more distinct letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding S,A,T,N,D).
  - Possible additional letters: R, M, G, B, C, etc.

Let me try ""RELIC"":
- R (new)
- E (must be used)
- L (must be used)
- I (must be used)
- C (new)

This uses R and C as new test letters while including L, E, I.

But wait, this might not be the most efficient. Let me think of a word that keeps L, E, I and adds minimal new letters.

Actually, we need 5 letters and already have L, E, I. We need two more distinct letters. Let me try ""FLEET"":
- F (new)
- L (must be used)
- E (must be used)
- E (but E is already used, and we don't know if it can repeat. The problem says ""5-letter word"" but doesn't specify uniqueness. However, the feedback treats each letter independently, so repeats are possible.)

But ""FLEET"" has E twice, which might not be optimal.

Better to use distinct letters: ""FLECK"":
- F (new)
- L (must be used)
- E (must be used)
- C (new)
- K (new)

But this uses 3 new letters (F, C, K) while including L, E.

Hmm, perhaps ""FLICK"" is better:
- F, L, I, C, K

This includes all required letters (L, I) plus E? No, missing E.

We must include E. Let me try ""PELIC"":
- P (new)
- E (must be used)
- L (must be used)
- I (must be used)
- C (new)

But ""PELIC"" is not a valid English word.

""ELITE"":
- E, L, I, T, E
- But T is already excluded.

""RELIC"" seems valid:
- R, E, L, I, C

This is a valid word and tests R and C.

Let me go with ""RELIC"".
</think>

Based on the feedback so far, we know:
- Letters in the word: L, E, I
- Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T, N, D
- Position constraints:
  - L not in positions 1 or 2
  - E not in positions 4 or 5
  - I not in position 2

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

After considering these, I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Guess 2: LINED -> FEEDBACK: L(-) I(-) N(x) E(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two clues we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. LINED → L(-) I(-) N(x) E(-) D(x)
   - L is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 4.
   - I is in the word but not in position 2.
   - N and D are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: L, E, I
- Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T, N, D
- Positions ruled out:
  - L ≠ 1, 2
  - E ≠ 4, 5
  - I ≠ 2

The remaining possible positions for each:
- L can be in 3 or 4 or 5 (but 5 is ruled out for E, so 3 or 4)
- E can be in 1, 2, or 3
- I can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5

We need a 5-letter word that uses exactly the letters L, E, I (each once) and avoids S, A, T, N, D.

Possible candidates:
- E, I, L must appear once each.
- Let's list valid permutations:
  - E I L _ _ : but we need 5 letters, and only have 3.
  - We need to include two more distinct letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding S,A,T,N,D).
  - Possible additional letters: R, M, G, B, C, etc.

Let me try ""RELIC"":
- R (new)
- E (must be used)
- L (must be used)
- I (must be used)
- C (new)

This uses R and C as new test letters while including L, E, I.

But wait, this might not be the most efficient. Let me think of a word that keeps L, E, I and adds minimal new letters.

Actually, we need 5 letters and already have L, E, I. We need two more distinct letters. Let me try ""FLEET"":
- F (new)
- L (must be used)
- E (must be used)
- E (but E is already used, and we don't know if it can repeat. The problem says ""5-letter word"" but doesn't specify uniqueness. However, the feedback treats each letter independently, so repeats are possible.)

But ""FLEET"" has E twice, which might not be optimal.

Better to use distinct letters: ""FLECK"":
- F (new)
- L (must be used)
- E (must be used)
- C (new)
- K (new)

But this uses 3 new letters (F, C, K) while including L, E.

Hmm, perhaps ""FLICK"" is better:
- F, L, I, C, K

This includes all required letters (L, I) plus E? No, missing E.

We must include E. Let me try ""PELIC"":
- P (new)
- E (must be used)
- L (must be used)
- I (must be used)
- C (new)

But ""PELIC"" is not a valid English word.

""ELITE"":
- E, L, I, T, E
- But T is already excluded.

""RELIC"" seems valid:
- R, E, L, I, C

This is a valid word and tests R and C.

Let me go with ""RELIC"".Based on the feedback so far, we know:
- Letters in the word: L, E, I
- Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T, N, D
- Position constraints:
  - L not in positions 1 or 2
  - E not in positions 4 or 5
  - I not in position 2

A valid 5-letter word that includes L, E, I and avoids all excluded letters is ""RELIC"". This tests new letters R and C while respecting the constraints.

From the new feedback on RELIC:

- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
- L(✓) → L is in the word AND in the correct position (position 3).
- I(✓) → I is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4).
- C(x) → C is NOT in the word.

So we now know the secret word has the pattern:
_ E L I _ (positions 2-4 are locked)

Letters confirmed to be in the word: E, L, I  
Letters confirmed NOT to be in the word: S, A, T, N, D, R, C  

We still need two more distinct letters for positions 1 and 5.  
Available letters (excluding all excluded ones): B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a valid 5-letter word that fits _ E L I _ and uses only allowed letters.  
Possible candidates:
- FELIM → invalid (not a word)
- GELID → uses D (already excluded)
- HELIX → uses X (allowed) and H (allowed)
- JELIB → invalid
- KELIM → invalid
- BELIE → uses B and E (E already used in position 2, but the word can have repeated letters; however, we don't know if E repeats)
- FELIS → uses S (excluded)
- HELIO → uses O (allowed) and H (allowed)

""HELIX"" is a valid word: H at 1, E at 2, L at 3, I at 4, X at 5. All letters H and X are not yet excluded.

""HELIO"" is also valid: H, E, L, I, O.

Between these, ""HELIX"" seems more likely since X is a common letter in such puzzles.

Let's go with ""HELIX"".
