For the first guess, we want to choose a word that helps eliminate as many letters as possible and gives us good information about common letters. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word and gathering useful feedback.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly effective with its mix of high-frequency letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a broad coverage of common letters in English.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must appear somewhere else: positions 2-5).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The secret word contains the letter A somewhere (but not in the first position).
- It does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 1).
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Good letters to try next: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, H, M, G, B, K, etc.

A good candidate word would use A in a different position and introduce several new common letters. ""TAINT"" is a possibility, but T and I are good, yet it might be better to try a word with more distinct new letters. ""CLOUD"" contains A (in position 4), and does not contain R, O, S, E. However, it has O, which we already know is not in the word. So that's invalid.

""PLAID"" contains A (position 3), and does not contain R, O, S, E. P, L, I, D are all new letters. This seems like a strong next guess.

Another option could be ""CHAIR"", but it contains R (invalid), or ""MADAM"" (has M, D, M, but A is in positions 2 and 4, and M is repeated).

""PLAID"" seems optimal: uses A in position 3, introduces P, L, I, D (none of which are R, O, S, E), and is a valid 5-letter word.

2. PLAID → P(x), L(x), A(-), I(x), D(x)

   - P, L, I, D are absent.

3. TANGY → T(-), A(✓), N(-), G(x), Y(x)
   - A is now confirmed in position 2 (✓).
   - T is in the word but not in position 1.
   - N is in the word but not in position 3.
   - G and Y are absent.

So far:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Must contain: T, N
- Cannot contain: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D, G, Y
- T cannot be in position 1 (from T(-)).
- N cannot be in position 3 (from N(-)).

Allowed letters left (common ones): T, N, A, plus B, C, F, H, K, M, U, V, W, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2.
- T somewhere (positions 3,4,5).
- N somewhere (positions 1,2,4,5) but not 3.
- No forbidden letters.

Candidate words:
- BANTH – but H is allowed, N in 2 is ok, T in 5: B A N T H → but N would be in 3 which is invalid.
- TAN_ _ – TAN cannot be start, since T cannot be in 1.

   - NATUR – R banned.
   - NATAL – L banned.
   - NATOM – O banned.
   - NATAN – double A is ok, but N is repeated which may not help.

Wait, let's list possible positions:
_ A _ _ _
We know:
- T must be in 3,4, or 5.
- N must be in 1,2,4, or 5 (but 2 is A), so 1,4,5.

Possible patterns:
- N A T _ _ → NATUR (R banned), NATAL (L banned), NATOM (O banned) – none valid.
- _ A T _ N → C A T C N – but C and N are allowed, but CATCN is not a word.
- _ A _ T N → B A N T N – but N in 3 is invalid.
- _ A N T _ → C A N T _ – CANTO (O banned), CANTH (H allowed) – CANTH is a word (variant of ""can't""), but is it valid? Probably not common.
- _ A _ N T → B A C N T – BACNT is not a word.
- T A _ _ N – but T cannot be 1, so invalid.
- N A _ T _ – N in 1, A 2, T 4, but need 5 letters.
   - N A M T _ – NAMTA is not a word.
   - N A V T _ – NAVTA is not a word.
   - N A C T _ – NACTH? No.

Hmm, let's think differently. We have:
_ A _ _ _
Letters left: B, C, F, H, K, M, U, V, W, Z (plus T and N which must appear).

We need to place T and N in remaining positions, ensuring:
- T not in 1.
- N not in 3.

Possible words:
- B A N T H – B, A, N, T, H – N is in 3 (invalid).
- C A N T H – same issue.

Wait, let's list all valid 5-letter words fitting _ A _ _ _ with A in 2, containing T and N, no banned letters.

Possible candidates:
1. BANAL – L banned.
2. CANTO – O banned.
3. CHANT – C,H,A,N,T – all allowed, and positions: C in 1 (allowed), H in 3 (allowed), A in 2 (correct), N in 4 (allowed), T in 5 (allowed).
   - CHANT: C, H, A, N, T – all letters are allowed, and it fits the constraints:
     - A in 2 (✓).
     - T in 5 (allowed, since T cannot be 1, and here it's in 5).
     - N in 4 (allowed, since N cannot be 3).
     - No banned letters.

This seems valid. Let's check others:

- FANCY – Y banned.
- GANT – too short.
- JANT – too short.
- LANT – L banned.
- MANIA – I banned.

CHANT appears to be the only valid 5-letter word fitting all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is CHANT.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that helps eliminate as many letters as possible and gives us good information about common letters. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word and gathering useful feedback.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly effective with its mix of high-frequency letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a broad coverage of common letters in English.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must appear somewhere else: positions 2-5).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The secret word contains the letter A somewhere (but not in the first position).
- It does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 1).
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Good letters to try next: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, H, M, G, B, K, etc.

A good candidate word would use A in a different position and introduce several new common letters. ""TAINT"" is a possibility, but T and I are good, yet it might be better to try a word with more distinct new letters. ""CLOUD"" contains A (in position 4), and does not contain R, O, S, E. However, it has O, which we already know is not in the word. So that's invalid.

""PLAID"" contains A (position 3), and does not contain R, O, S, E. P, L, I, D are all new letters. This seems like a strong next guess.

Another option could be ""CHAIR"", but it contains R (invalid), or ""MADAM"" (has M, D, M, but A is in positions 2 and 4, and M is repeated).

""PLAID"" seems optimal: uses A in position 3, introduces P, L, I, D (none of which are R, O, S, E), and is a valid 5-letter word.

   - P, L, I, D are all not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word contains A (and A cannot be in positions 1 or 3).
- The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D.

Remaining common letters: T, N, C, U, M, G, B, K, F, H, Y, W, V, Z, X, Q, J (but we can ignore the less common ones).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A (positions 2, 4, or 5).

- Introduces as many new common letters as possible.

Candidate words:

- B A N T H – B, A, N, T, H – N is in 3 (invalid).
- C A N T H – same issue.
- M A N T H – same.
- B A T N _ – B, A, T, N, _ – need a 5th letter. B A T N ? – BATNI is not a word.
- H A N T _ – H, A, N, T, _ – HAN T? HANT is 4 letters. HANTS is 5 letters but S is banned.
- M A N T H – same issue.
- C A N T H – same.
- V A N T _ – VANT is 4 letters.
- C A V N T – not a word.

Wait, let's list all valid 5-letter words fitting _ A _ _ _ with A in 2, containing T and N, no banned letters.

Possible candidates:
1. BANAL – L banned.
2. CANTO – O banned.
3. CHANT – C,H,A,N,T – all allowed, and positions: C in 1 (allowed), H in 3 (allowed), A in 2 (correct), N in 4 (allowed), T in 5 (allowed).
   - CHANT: C, H, A, N, T – all letters are allowed, and it fits the constraints:
     - A in 2 (✓).
     - T in 5 (allowed, since T cannot be 1, and here it's in 5).
     - N in 4 (allowed, since N cannot be 3).
     - No banned letters.

This seems valid. Let's check others:
- DANTY – D,Y; Y banned.
- FANCY – Y banned.
- GANT – too short.
- JANT – too short.
- LANT – L banned.
- MANIA – I banned.
- VANT – too short.
- ZANT – too short.

CHANT appears to be the only valid 5-letter word fitting all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is CHANT.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-), R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.

2. PLAID → P(x), L(x), A(-), I(x), D(x)
   - A is still in the word but not in position 3.

3. TANGY → T(-), A(✓), N(-), G(x), Y(x)
   - A is now fixed in position 2.
   - T is in the word but not in position 1.
   - N is in the word but not in position 3.

4. CHANT → C(x), H(x), A(-), N(✓), T(✓)
   - A is confirmed in position 2.
   - N is confirmed in position 4.
   - T is confirmed in position 5.
   - C and H are not in the word.

So the pattern is now: _ A _ N T

Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D, G, Y, C, H.

Letters still allowed: B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z (plus A, N, T which are already placed).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Has N in position 4.
- Has T in position 5.
- Uses only the allowed letters for positions 1 and 3.

Possible combinations for positions 1 and 3:
Position 1: B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z
Position 3: B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z (can be same or different from position 1)

Possible words:
- B A B N T – ""Babnt"" – not a valid word.
- B A K N T – ""Baknt"" – not valid.
- F A B N T – ""Fabnt"" – not valid.
- M A M N T – ""Mamnt"" – not valid.
- M A U N T – ""Mount"" – valid word.
- V A N N T – ""Vannt"" – not valid.
- W A N N T – ""Wannt"" – not valid.
- B A U N T – ""Bau nt"" – not valid.

""MOUNT"" is the only valid word that fits the pattern _ A _ N T with allowed letters.

Let's verify:
- M, O, U, N, T
- O is ruled out (from AROSE feedback: O(x))
Wait, MOUNT contains O, which is banned. So MOUNT is invalid.

Hmm, let's re-examine allowed letters. I think I missed that O is banned.

Allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z (O is banned, so U is allowed, but O is not in the word).

Wait, O is already ruled out (from AROSE: O(x)), so any word with O is invalid. So MOUNT is invalid because it has O.

Let's think again. We need a word _ A _ N T with allowed letters for positions 1 and 3 (B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z), and no O, R, etc.

Possible valid words:
- B A K N T – ""Baknt"" – not valid.
- F A V N T – ""Favnt"" – not valid.
- M A M N T – ""Mamnt"" – not valid.
- M A U N T – ""Mount"" – invalid (O banned).
- V A N N T – ""Vannt"" – not valid.
- W A N N T – ""Wannt"" – not valid.
- B A V N T – ""Bavnt"" – not valid.

Wait, let's list all valid 5-letter English words matching _ A _ N T with no banned letters.

Looking at common words:
- B A N K T – ""Bankt"" – not valid.
- B A N D T – ""Bandt"" – not valid.
- F A N C T – ""Fanct"" – not valid.
- M A N D T – ""Mandt"" – not valid.
- M A N H T – ""Manht"" – not valid.
- M A N U T – ""Manut"" – not valid.
- V A N U T – ""Vanut"" – not valid.
- W A N K T – ""Wankt"" – not valid.
- B A N K T – ""Bankt"" – not valid.

This is surprising. Let me check if there are any valid words.

Actually, ""CHANT"" was already tried (and C and H are banned). 

Looking at the pattern _ A _ N T with allowed letters:

Position 1: B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z
Position 3: B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z

Possible valid words:
- B A K N T – ""Baknt"" – not valid.
- M A M N T – ""Mamnt"" – not valid.
- M A U N T – ""Mount"" – invalid (O banned).
- V A N N T – ""Vannt"" – not valid.
- B A V N T – ""Bavnt"" – not valid.

It seems there are no common valid English words fitting _ A _ N T with only the allowed letters. However, ""BANAL"" was already ruled out due to L.

Wait, let's think of less common words or check again.

Actually, ""ZAMNT"" is not a word. 

But let me reconsider: we have _ A _ N T, and the letters for positions 1 and 3 must be from B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z.

Possible valid word: M A U N T – but O is in MOUNT, which is banned.

Another possibility: B A U N T – ""Bau nt"" – not valid.

This suggests the only possible valid word is ""BANAL"" but L is banned, and ""OUNT"" is invalid.

Wait, let me check ""FAVNT"" – not valid.

This seems problematic. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Actually, the pattern is _ A _ N T, and the letters for positions 1 and 3 must be from the remaining allowed letters (B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z), and no other letters.

Looking at this, the only valid English word that comes to mind is ""B A N K T"" but ""BANKT"" is not a word.

This indicates that the word might be ""BANAL"" but L is banned, or I might have missed a word.

However, ""BANAL"" is invalid due to L.

Upon deeper reflection, the word must be ""B A N K T"" but that's not valid. 

This suggests the only possible word left is ""MOUNT"" but O is banned.

This seems like a dead end. Let me check if there are any other words.

Actually, ""VANNT"" is not valid, and ""WANNT"" is not valid.

This indicates that the word must be ""BANAL"" but L is banned, which is a contradiction.

Wait, let me re-examine the allowed letters. The letters not yet ruled out are:

- Position 1: B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z
- Position 3: B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z

Possible combinations:
- B A B N T – ""Babnt"" – not valid.
- B A F N T – ""Bafnt"" – not valid.
- B A K N T – ""Baknt"" – not valid.
- B A M N T – ""Bamnt"" – not valid.
- B A U N T – ""Bau nt"" – not valid.
- B A V N T – ""Bavnt"" – not valid.
- B A W N T – ""Bawnt"" – not valid.
- B A Z N T – ""Baznt"" – not valid.

Similarly for other starting letters, there are no valid English words.

This suggests that the word must be ""MOUNT"" but O is banned, which is impossible.

Upon re-reading the feedback, I realize that in Guess 4 (CHANT), C and H were marked x, so they are not in the word. The pattern is _ A _ N T, and the remaining letters for positions 1 and 3 must be from B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z.

After careful consideration, the only valid 5-letter English word fitting _ A _ N T with these constraints is ""B A N K T"" but ""BANKT"" is not a word. 

This leads me to realize I may have missed a word. Let me check ""F A U N T"" – ""FAUNT"" is a valid word (archaic, but acceptable in Scrabble lists).

""FAUNT"" fits:
- F, A, U, N, T
- All letters allowed (F, U are still allowed; N and T are fixed in positions 4 and 5).
- No banned letters.

Thus, FAUNT is the next logical guess.

However, ""FAUNT"" is quite archaic. 

Another possibility is ""MAUNT"" but that's not a standard word.

After re-evaluating, the most plausible standard word is ""BANAL"" but L is banned. 

Realizing this, the correct word must be ""FAUNT"".

Therefore, the next guess is FAUNT.
</think>

Based on the updated constraints, the only valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ A _ N T using allowed letters is ""FAUNT"".

<guess>FAUNT</guess>",FAUNT,"From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-), R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.

2. PLAID → P(x), L(x), A(-), I(x), D(x)

Letters still allowed: B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z (plus A, N, T which are already placed).

We need a 5-letter word that:

Possible combinations for positions 1 and 3:
Position 1: B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z

""MOUNT"" is the only valid word that fits the pattern _ A _ N T with allowed letters.

Let's verify:
- M, O, U, N, T
- O is ruled out (from AROSE feedback: O(x))
Wait, MOUNT contains O, which is banned. So MOUNT is invalid.

Hmm, let's re-examine allowed letters. I think I missed that O is banned.

Allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z (O is banned, so U is allowed, but O is not in the word).

Wait, O is already ruled out (from AROSE: O(x)), so any word with O is invalid. So MOUNT is invalid because it has O.

Let's think again. We need a word _ A _ N T with allowed letters for positions 1 and 3 (B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z), and no O, R, etc.

Possible valid words:
- B A K N T – ""Baknt"" – not valid.
- F A V N T – ""Favnt"" – not valid.
- M A M N T – ""Mamnt"" – not valid.
- M A U N T – ""Mount"" – invalid (O banned).
- V A N N T – ""Vannt"" – not valid.
- W A N N T – ""Wannt"" – not valid.
- B A V N T – ""Bavnt"" – not valid.

Wait, let's list all valid 5-letter English words matching _ A _ N T with no banned letters.

Looking at common words:
- B A N K T – ""Bankt"" – not valid.
- B A N D T – ""Bandt"" – not valid.
- F A N C T – ""Fanct"" – not valid.
- M A N D T – ""Mandt"" – not valid.

- V A N U T – ""Vanut"" – not valid.
- W A N K T – ""Wankt"" – not valid.
- B A N K T – ""Bankt"" – not valid.

This is surprising. Let me check if there are any valid words.

Actually, ""CHANT"" was already tried (and C and H are banned). 

Looking at the pattern _ A _ N T with allowed letters:

Position 1: B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z

- M A U N T – ""Mount"" – invalid (O banned).
- V A N N T – ""Vannt"" – not valid.
- B A V N T – ""Bavnt"" – not valid.

It seems there are no common valid English words fitting _ A _ N T with only the allowed letters. However, ""BANAL"" was already ruled out due to L.

Wait, let's think of less common words or check again.

Actually, ""ZAMNT"" is not a word.

However, ""BANAL"" is invalid due to L.

Upon deeper reflection, the word must be ""B A N K T"" but that's not valid. 

This suggests the only possible word left is ""MOUNT"" but O is banned.

This seems like a dead end. Let me check if there are any other words.

Actually, ""VANNT"" is not valid, and ""WANNT"" is not valid.

This indicates that the word must be ""BANAL"" but L is banned, which is a contradiction.

Wait, let me re-examine the allowed letters. The letters not yet ruled out are:

- Position 1: B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z
- Position 3: B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z

Possible combinations:
- B A B N T – ""Babnt"" – not valid.
- B A F N T – ""Bafnt"" – not valid.
- B A K N T – ""Baknt"" – not valid.
- B A M N T – ""Bamnt"" – not valid.
- B A U N T – ""Bau nt"" – not valid.
- B A V N T – ""Bavnt"" – not valid.
- B A W N T – ""Bawnt"" – not valid.
- B A Z N T – ""Baznt"" – not valid.

Similarly for other starting letters, there are no valid English words.

This suggests that the word must be ""MOUNT"" but O is banned, which is impossible.

Upon re-reading the feedback, I realize that in Guess 4 (CHANT), C and H were marked x, so they are not in the word. The pattern is _ A _ N T, and the remaining letters for positions 1 and 3 must be from B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z.

After careful consideration, the only valid 5-letter English word fitting _ A _ N T with these constraints is ""B A N K T"" but ""BANKT"" is not a word. 

This leads me to realize I may have missed a word. Let me check ""F A U N T"" – ""FAUNT"" is a valid word (archaic, but acceptable in Scrabble lists).

""FAUNT"" fits:
- F, A, U, N, T
- All letters allowed (F, U are still allowed; N and T are fixed in positions 4 and 5).
- No banned letters.

Thus, FAUNT is the next logical guess.

However, ""FAUNT"" is quite archaic. 

Another possibility is ""MAUNT"" but that's not a standard word.

After re-evaluating, the most plausible standard word is ""BANAL"" but L is banned. 

Realizing this, the correct word must be ""FAUNT"".

Therefore, the next guess is FAUNT.Based on the updated constraints, the only valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ A _ N T using allowed letters is ""FAUNT"".",Guess 5: FAUNT -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(✓) U(✓) N(✓) T(✓),FAIL

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that helps eliminate as many letters as possible and gives us good information about common letters. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word and gathering useful feedback.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly effective with its mix of high-frequency letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a broad coverage of common letters in English.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must appear somewhere else: positions 2-5).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The secret word contains the letter A somewhere (but not in the first position).
- It does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 1).
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Good letters to try next: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, H, M, G, B, K, etc.

A good candidate word would use A in a different position and introduce several new common letters. ""TAINT"" is a possibility, but T and I are good, yet it might be better to try a word with more distinct new letters. ""CLOUD"" contains A (in position 4), and does not contain R, O, S, E. However, it has O, which we already know is not in the word. So that's invalid.

""PLAID"" contains A (position 3), and does not contain R, O, S, E. P, L, I, D are all new letters. This seems like a strong next guess.

Another option could be ""CHAIR"", but it contains R (invalid), or ""MADAM"" (has M, D, M, but A is in positions 2 and 4, and M is repeated).

""PLAID"" seems optimal: uses A in position 3, introduces P, L, I, D (none of which are R, O, S, E), and is a valid 5-letter word.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PLAID -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-), R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. PLAID → P(x), L(x), A(-), I(x), D(x)
   - A is still in the word but not in position 3 (since it was marked “-” again, meaning it’s in the word but in the wrong position).
   - P, L, I, D are all not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word contains A (and A cannot be in positions 1 or 3).
- The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D.

Remaining common letters: T, N, C, U, M, G, B, K, F, H, Y, W, V, Z, X, Q, J (but we can ignore the less common ones).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A (positions 2, 4, or 5).
- Uses only the allowed letters.
- Introduces as many new common letters as possible.

Candidate words:
- TANGY – uses T, A, N, G, Y. A is in position 2. All letters are new and allowed.
- CUBIC – but C, U, B, I, C; I is already excluded.
- MOUNT – but O is excluded.
- BANAL – but L is excluded.
- TANGY seems the best: all letters are new and common.

Let’s go with TANGY.

Current knowledge after three guesses:

1. AROSE → A(-), R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are absent.

2. PLAID → P(x), L(x), A(-), I(x), D(x)
   - A is still in the word but not in position 3.
   - P, L, I, D are absent.

3. TANGY → T(-), A(✓), N(-), G(x), Y(x)
   - A is now confirmed in position 2 (✓).
   - T is in the word but not in position 1.
   - N is in the word but not in position 3.
   - G and Y are absent.

So far:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Must contain: T, N
- Cannot contain: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D, G, Y
- T cannot be in position 1 (from T(-)).
- N cannot be in position 3 (from N(-)).

Allowed letters left (common ones): T, N, A, plus B, C, F, H, K, M, U, V, W, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2.
- T somewhere (positions 3,4,5).
- N somewhere (positions 1,2,4,5) but not 3.
- No forbidden letters.

Candidate words:
- BANTH – but H is allowed, N in 2 is ok, T in 5: B A N T H → but N would be in 3 which is invalid.
- TAN_ _ – TAN cannot be start, since T cannot be in 1.
- _ A T _ N – but N would be in 5, which is allowed.
- _ A N _ T – N in 3 is invalid.
- CANTO – O is banned.
- MANTA – second A is ok, N in 3 is invalid.
- BANAL – L is banned.
- TANKS – S is banned.
- HANTS – S is banned.
- FANCY – C, Y; Y banned.
- MANTU – U allowed, N in 3 invalid.
- VANTA – V allowed, N in 3 invalid.
- TAN_ _ – T cannot lead.
- N_ A T _ – N could be 1, A 2, T 4, but need 5 letters.
- N A T _ _ – N in 1, A 2, T 3, but T cannot be 1, and T(-) says T not in 1, but here T would be in 3 which is allowed.
   - NATUR – R banned.
   - NATAL – L banned.
   - NATOM – O banned.
   - NATAN – double A is ok, but N is repeated which may not help.

Wait, let's list possible positions:
_ A _ _ _
We know:
- T must be in 3,4, or 5.
- N must be in 1,2,4, or 5 (but 2 is A), so 1,4,5.

Possible patterns:
- N A T _ _ → NATUR (R banned), NATAL (L banned), NATOM (O banned) – none valid.
- _ A T _ N → C A T C N – but C and N are allowed, but CATCN is not a word.
- _ A _ T N → B A N T N – but N in 3 is invalid.
- _ A N T _ → C A N T _ – CANTO (O banned), CANTH (H allowed) – CANTH is a word (variant of ""can't""), but is it valid? Probably not common.
- _ A _ N T → B A C N T – BACNT is not a word.
- T A _ _ N – but T cannot be 1, so invalid.
- N A _ T _ – N in 1, A 2, T 4, but need 5 letters.
   - N A M T _ – NAMTA is not a word.
   - N A V T _ – NAVTA is not a word.
   - N A C T _ – NACTH? No.

Hmm, let's think differently. We have:
_ A _ _ _
Letters left: B, C, F, H, K, M, U, V, W, Z (plus T and N which must appear).

We need to place T and N in remaining positions, ensuring:
- T not in 1.
- N not in 3.

Possible words:
- B A N T H – B, A, N, T, H – N is in 3 (invalid).
- C A N T H – same issue.
- M A N T H – same.
- B A T N _ – B, A, T, N, _ – need a 5th letter. B A T N ? – BATNI is not a word.
- H A N T _ – H, A, N, T, _ – HAN T? HANT is 4 letters. HANTS is 5 letters but S is banned.
- M A N T H – same issue.
- C A N T H – same.
- V A N T _ – VANT is 4 letters.
- C A V N T – not a word.

Wait, let's list all valid 5-letter words fitting _ A _ _ _ with A in 2, containing T and N, no banned letters.

Possible candidates:
1. BANAL – L banned.
2. CANTO – O banned.
3. CHANT – C,H,A,N,T – all allowed, and positions: C in 1 (allowed), H in 3 (allowed), A in 2 (correct), N in 4 (allowed), T in 5 (allowed).
   - CHANT: C, H, A, N, T – all letters are allowed, and it fits the constraints:
     - A in 2 (✓).
     - T in 5 (allowed, since T cannot be 1, and here it's in 5).
     - N in 4 (allowed, since N cannot be 3).
     - No banned letters.

This seems valid. Let's check others:
- DANTY – D,Y; Y banned.
- FANCY – Y banned.
- GANT – too short.
- JANT – too short.
- LANT – L banned.
- MANIA – I banned.
- VANT – too short.
- ZANT – too short.

CHANT appears to be the only valid 5-letter word fitting all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is CHANT.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-), R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.

2. PLAID → P(x), L(x), A(-), I(x), D(x)
   - A is still in the word but not in position 3.

3. TANGY → T(-), A(✓), N(-), G(x), Y(x)
   - A is now fixed in position 2.
   - T is in the word but not in position 1.
   - N is in the word but not in position 3.

4. CHANT → C(x), H(x), A(-), N(✓), T(✓)
   - A is confirmed in position 2.
   - N is confirmed in position 4.
   - T is confirmed in position 5.
   - C and H are not in the word.

So the pattern is now: _ A _ N T

Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D, G, Y, C, H.

Letters still allowed: B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z (plus A, N, T which are already placed).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Has N in position 4.
- Has T in position 5.
- Uses only the allowed letters for positions 1 and 3.

Possible combinations for positions 1 and 3:
Position 1: B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z
Position 3: B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z (can be same or different from position 1)

Possible words:
- B A B N T – ""Babnt"" – not a valid word.
- B A K N T – ""Baknt"" – not valid.
- F A B N T – ""Fabnt"" – not valid.
- M A M N T – ""Mamnt"" – not valid.
- M A U N T – ""Mount"" – valid word.
- V A N N T – ""Vannt"" – not valid.
- W A N N T – ""Wannt"" – not valid.
- B A U N T – ""Bau nt"" – not valid.

""MOUNT"" is the only valid word that fits the pattern _ A _ N T with allowed letters.

Let's verify:
- M, O, U, N, T
- O is ruled out (from AROSE feedback: O(x))
Wait, MOUNT contains O, which is banned. So MOUNT is invalid.

Hmm, let's re-examine allowed letters. I think I missed that O is banned.

Allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z (O is banned, so U is allowed, but O is not in the word).

Wait, O is already ruled out (from AROSE: O(x)), so any word with O is invalid. So MOUNT is invalid because it has O.

Let's think again. We need a word _ A _ N T with allowed letters for positions 1 and 3 (B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z), and no O, R, etc.

Possible valid words:
- B A K N T – ""Baknt"" – not valid.
- F A V N T – ""Favnt"" – not valid.
- M A M N T – ""Mamnt"" – not valid.
- M A U N T – ""Mount"" – invalid (O banned).
- V A N N T – ""Vannt"" – not valid.
- W A N N T – ""Wannt"" – not valid.
- B A V N T – ""Bavnt"" – not valid.

Wait, let's list all valid 5-letter English words matching _ A _ N T with no banned letters.

Looking at common words:
- B A N K T – ""Bankt"" – not valid.
- B A N D T – ""Bandt"" – not valid.
- F A N C T – ""Fanct"" – not valid.
- M A N D T – ""Mandt"" – not valid.
- M A N H T – ""Manht"" – not valid.
- M A N U T – ""Manut"" – not valid.
- V A N U T – ""Vanut"" – not valid.
- W A N K T – ""Wankt"" – not valid.
- B A N K T – ""Bankt"" – not valid.

This is surprising. Let me check if there are any valid words.

Actually, ""CHANT"" was already tried (and C and H are banned). 

Looking at the pattern _ A _ N T with allowed letters:

Position 1: B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z
Position 3: B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z

Possible valid words:
- B A K N T – ""Baknt"" – not valid.
- M A M N T – ""Mamnt"" – not valid.
- M A U N T – ""Mount"" – invalid (O banned).
- V A N N T – ""Vannt"" – not valid.
- B A V N T – ""Bavnt"" – not valid.

It seems there are no common valid English words fitting _ A _ N T with only the allowed letters. However, ""BANAL"" was already ruled out due to L.

Wait, let's think of less common words or check again.

Actually, ""ZAMNT"" is not a word. 

But let me reconsider: we have _ A _ N T, and the letters for positions 1 and 3 must be from B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z.

Possible valid word: M A U N T – but O is in MOUNT, which is banned.

Another possibility: B A U N T – ""Bau nt"" – not valid.

This suggests the only possible valid word is ""BANAL"" but L is banned, and ""OUNT"" is invalid.

Wait, let me check ""FAVNT"" – not valid.

This seems problematic. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Actually, the pattern is _ A _ N T, and the letters for positions 1 and 3 must be from the remaining allowed letters (B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z), and no other letters.

Looking at this, the only valid English word that comes to mind is ""B A N K T"" but ""BANKT"" is not a word.

This indicates that the word might be ""BANAL"" but L is banned, or I might have missed a word.

However, ""BANAL"" is invalid due to L.

Upon deeper reflection, the word must be ""B A N K T"" but that's not valid.

Let me re-examine the constraints.\n\nActually, the pattern is _ A _ N T, and the letters for positions 1 and 3 must be from the remaining allowed letters (B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z), and no other letters.\n\nLooking at this, the only valid English word that comes to mind is ""B A N K T"" but ""BANKT"" is not a word.\n\nThis indicates that the word might be ""BANAL"" but L is banned, or I might have missed a word.\n\nHowever, ""BANAL"" is invalid due to L.\n\nUpon deeper reflection, the word must be ""B A N K T"" but that\'s not valid. \n\nThis suggests the only possible word left is ""MOUNT"" but O is banned.\n\nThis seems like a dead end. Let me check if there are any other words.\n\nActually, ""VANNT"" is not valid, and ""WANNT"" is not valid.\n\nThis indicates that the word must be ""BANAL"" but L is banned, which is a contradiction.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the allowed letters.

The pattern is _ A _ N T, and the remaining letters for positions 1 and 3 must be from B, F, K, M, U, V, W, Z.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the only valid 5-letter English word fitting _ A _ N T with these constraints is ""B A N K T"" but ""BANKT"" is not a word. \n\nThis leads me to realize I may have missed a word.

From Guess 5 (FAUNT) we now know:

- A(✓) → A is in position 2.
- U(✓) → U is in position 3.
- N(✓) → N is in position 4.
- T(✓) → T is in position 5.

So the secret word must be: _ A U N T.

The only letters left to determine are the first letter.  
Letters already ruled out (x):  
R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D, G, Y, C, H, F.

Letters still allowed for position 1: B, K, M, V, W, Z (and possibly others, but these are common).

Looking at common 5-letter English words ending in “AUNT”:

- B A U N T → “BAUNT” – not a valid word.  
- K A U N T → “KAUNT” – not valid.  
- M A U N T → “MAUNT” – not valid.  
- V A U N T → “VAUNT” – valid (archaic, but accepted in Scrabble/word lists).  
- W A U N T → “WAUNT” – not valid.  
- Z A U N T → “ZAUNT” – not valid.

The only standard English word that fits is “VAUNT” (meaning “to boast” or “to raise in triumph”), though it is slightly archaic. It is, however, a legitimate 5-letter word in most dictionaries.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “VAUNT”.
