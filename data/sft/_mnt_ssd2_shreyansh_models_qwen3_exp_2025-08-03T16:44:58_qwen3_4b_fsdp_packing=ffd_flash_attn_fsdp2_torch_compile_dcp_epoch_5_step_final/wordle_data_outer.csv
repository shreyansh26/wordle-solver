For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word often contains common vowels and consonants. One such word is ""AROSE"" which includes:
- Common vowels: A, O, E
- Common consonants: R, S

This should give me good information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
Letters in the word: R, O, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively).
Letters not in the word: A, S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains R, O, E (but R not in position 2, O not in position 3, E not in position 5).
- Does not contain A or S.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “ROUTE”:
- It has R, O, E.
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- E is in position 5 (but we know E is not in position 5, so this is a conflict).  
Oops, let me avoid E in position 5.

Another candidate: “TROPE”:
- T, R, O, P, E.
- R in position 2 (but R cannot be in position 2).  Conflict again.

Next: “CREPE”:
- C, R, E, P, E.
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try “DROVE”:
- D, R, O, V, E.
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try “GROVE”:
- G, R, O, V, E.

Try “BROKE”:

Try “PROVE”:

Try “ROUTE” again: E is in position 5 (invalid).

Try “COWER”:
- C, O, W, E, R.
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- R is in position 5 (allowed).
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- Does not contain A or S.

This seems valid.

Alternatively: “OWER” is 4 letters, so invalid.

Another option: “CORER”:
- C, O, R, E, R.
- R in position 3 and 5 (allowed for R).
- O in position 2 (allowed).
- E in position 4 (allowed).
- Contains A? No, A is not in word.

But “CORER” has R twice, which might not add much info.

From the two guesses so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)  
   – Letters in word somewhere: R, O, E  
   – Letters not in word: A, S

2. cower → C(x) O(-) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)  
   – Letters not in word: C, W, A, S  
   – Letters in word and in correct positions: E (position 4), R (position 5)  
   – Letters in word but not yet positioned: O

So we now know:
- E is fixed at position 4.  
- R is fixed at position 5.  
- O is somewhere among positions 1, 2, 3.  
- Still missing two more letters (positions 1, 2, 3 must include O plus one more letter each).  
- Allowed letters so far: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z (excluding A, C, S, W).

Candidate words:
- O must be in 1, 2, or 3.  
- Need two more distinct letters (not repeating O, E, R).

Let’s try placing O in position 1:
O _ _ E R → need two letters for positions 2 and 3.  
Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, etc.

Try “O B I E R” – but I is a vowel and might be too obscure.  
Try “O B L E R” – no.  
Try “O D E R E R” – repeats E.  
Try “O D I E R” – no.  
Try “O M B E R” – valid word “OMBER” but not common.

Try O in position 2:
_ O _ E R → need letters for 1 and 3.  
Try “T O B E R” – “TOBER” is not a word.  
Try “P O N E R” – “PONER” is not valid.  
Try “L O N E R” – “LONER” is valid.

Check “LONER”:
- L, O, N, E, R – no forbidden letters (A, C, S, W).  
- E is in position 4 (correct).  
- R is in position 5 (correct).  
- O is in position 2 (allowed).  
- L and N are new letters we haven’t tested yet.

Looks good.

Alternative with O in position 3:
_ _ O E R → need letters for 1 and 2.  
Try “B I O E R” – no.  
Try “T I O E R” – no.  
Try “T R O E R” – repeats R.  
Try “D I O E R” – no.  
“D R O E R” – repeats R.  
“M I O E R” – no.  
“M O” – already O in 3.  
Seems “LONER” is the best.

Thus, next guess: “LONER”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
Letters in the word: R, O, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively).
Letters not in the word: A, S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains R, O, E (but R not in position 2, O not in position 3, E not in position 5).
- Does not contain A or S.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “ROUTE”:
- It has R, O, E.
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- E is in position 5 (but we know E is not in position 5, so this is a conflict).  
Oops, let me avoid E in position 5.

Another candidate: “TROPE”:
- T, R, O, P, E.
- R in position 2 (but R cannot be in position 2).  Conflict again.

Next: “CREPE”:
- C, R, E, P, E.
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try “DROVE”:
- D, R, O, V, E.
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try “GROVE”:
- G, R, O, V, E.
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try “BROKE”:
- B, R, O, K, E.
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try “PROVE”:
- P, R, O, V, E.
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try “ROUTE” again: E is in position 5 (invalid).

Try “COWER”:
- C, O, W, E, R.
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- R is in position 5 (allowed).
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- Does not contain A or S.

This seems valid.

Alternatively: “OWER” is 4 letters, so invalid.

Another option: “CORER”:
- C, O, R, E, R.
- R in position 3 and 5 (allowed for R).
- O in position 2 (allowed).
- E in position 4 (allowed).
- Contains A? No, A is not in word.

But “CORER” has R twice, which might not add much info.

Better: “COWER” as it tests new letters (C, W).

Final choice: “COWER”.

Guess 2: cower -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(-) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>

From the two guesses so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)  
   – Letters in word somewhere: R, O, E  
   – Letters not in word: A, S

2. cower → C(x) O(-) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)  
   – Letters not in word: C, W, A, S  
   – Letters in word and in correct positions: E (position 4), R (position 5)  
   – Letters in word but not yet positioned: O

So we now know:
- E is fixed at position 4.  
- R is fixed at position 5.  
- O is somewhere among positions 1, 2, 3.  
- Still missing two more letters (positions 1, 2, 3 must include O plus one more letter each).  
- Allowed letters so far: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z (excluding A, C, S, W).

Candidate words:
- O must be in 1, 2, or 3.  
- Need two more distinct letters (not repeating O, E, R).

Let’s try placing O in position 1:
O _ _ E R → need two letters for positions 2 and 3.  
Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, etc.

Try “O B I E R” – but I is a vowel and might be too obscure.  
Try “O B L E R” – no.  
Try “O D E R E R” – repeats E.  
Try “O D I E R” – no.  
Try “O M B E R” – valid word “OMBER” but not common.

Try O in position 2:
_ O _ E R → need letters for 1 and 3.  
Try “T O B E R” – “TOBER” is not a word.  
Try “P O N E R” – “PONER” is not valid.  
Try “L O N E R” – “LONER” is valid.

Check “LONER”:
- L, O, N, E, R – no forbidden letters (A, C, S, W).  
- E is in position 4 (correct).  
- R is in position 5 (correct).  
- O is in position 2 (allowed).  
- L and N are new letters we haven’t tested yet.

Looks good.

Alternative with O in position 3:
_ _ O E R → need letters for 1 and 2.  
Try “B I O E R” – no.  
Try “T I O E R” – no.  
Try “T R O E R” – repeats R.  
Try “D I O E R” – no.  
“D R O E R” – repeats R.  
“M I O E R” – no.  
“M O” – already O in 3.  
Seems “LONER” is the best.

Thus, next guess: “LONER”.

O [?] [?] E R  (O in position 1)

Let's test O in position 3 first since it's the most constrained:
Pattern: _ _ O E R
Need two letters for positions 1 and 2, not in ruled-out set.
Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, Y, Z
Try common combinations:
- D O G E R → DOGER (not a valid word)
- F O G E R → FOGER (valid word, though rare)
- H O G E R → HOGER (not standard)
- M O G E R → MOGER (not valid)
- P O G E R → POGER (not valid)
- B O G E R → BOGER (not valid)

Try O in position 2:
Pattern: _ O _ E R
Need letters 1 and 3. Good options:
- B O D E R → BODER (not valid)
- F O G E R → FOGER (same as above)
- H O D E R → HODER (not valid)
- M O D E R → MODER (valid word)

Check MODER:
- M, O, D, E, R → no ruled-out letters
- E in position 4 ✓
- R in position 5 ✓
- O in position 2 ✓
- M and D are new letters

This seems optimal.

Alternative with O in position 1:
O _ _ E R
Need letters 2 and 3:
- O B D E R → OBDER (not valid)
- O M D E R → OMDER (not valid)
- O D I E R → ODIER (not valid)
- O M I E R → OMIER (not valid)

No clear valid words here compared to MODER, so stick with MODER.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word often contains common vowels and consonants. One such word is ""AROSE"" which includes:
- Common vowels: A, O, E
- Common consonants: R, S

This should give me good information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
Letters in the word: R, O, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively).
Letters not in the word: A, S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains R, O, E (but R not in position 2, O not in position 3, E not in position 5).
- Does not contain A or S.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “ROUTE”:
- It has R, O, E.
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- E is in position 5 (but we know E is not in position 5, so this is a conflict).  
Oops, let me avoid E in position 5.

Another candidate: “TROPE”:
- T, R, O, P, E.
- R in position 2 (but R cannot be in position 2).  Conflict again.

Next: “CREPE”:
- C, R, E, P, E.
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try “DROVE”:
- D, R, O, V, E.
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try “GROVE”:
- G, R, O, V, E.
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try “BROKE”:
- B, R, O, K, E.
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try “PROVE”:
- P, R, O, V, E.
- R in position 2 (invalid).

Try “ROUTE” again: E is in position 5 (invalid).

Try “COWER”:
- C, O, W, E, R.
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- R is in position 5 (allowed).
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- Does not contain A or S.

This seems valid.

Alternatively: “OWER” is 4 letters, so invalid.

Another option: “CORER”:
- C, O, R, E, R.
- R in position 3 and 5 (allowed for R).
- O in position 2 (allowed).
- E in position 4 (allowed).
- Contains A? No, A is not in word.

But “CORER” has R twice, which might not add much info.

Better: “COWER” as it tests new letters (C, W).

Final choice: “COWER”.

From the two guesses so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)  
   – Letters in word somewhere: R, O, E  
   – Letters not in word: A, S

2. cower → C(x) O(-) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)  
   – Letters not in word: C, W, A, S  
   – Letters in word and in correct positions: E (position 4), R (position 5)  
   – Letters in word but not yet positioned: O

So we now know:
- E is fixed at position 4.  
- R is fixed at position 5.  
- O is somewhere among positions 1, 2, 3.  
- Still missing two more letters (positions 1, 2, 3 must include O plus one more letter each).  
- Allowed letters so far: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z (excluding A, C, S, W).

Candidate words:
- O must be in 1, 2, or 3.  
- Need two more distinct letters (not repeating O, E, R).

Let’s try placing O in position 1:
O _ _ E R → need two letters for positions 2 and 3.  
Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, etc.

Try “O B I E R” – but I is a vowel and might be too obscure.  
Try “O B L E R” – no.  
Try “O D E R E R” – repeats E.  
Try “O D I E R” – no.  
Try “O M B E R” – valid word “OMBER” but not common.

Try O in position 2:
_ O _ E R → need letters for 1 and 3.  
Try “T O B E R” – “TOBER” is not a word.  
Try “P O N E R” – “PONER” is not valid.  
Try “L O N E R” – “LONER” is valid.

Check “LONER”:
- L, O, N, E, R – no forbidden letters (A, C, S, W).  
- E is in position 4 (correct).  
- R is in position 5 (correct).  
- O is in position 2 (allowed).  
- L and N are new letters we haven’t tested yet.

Looks good.

Alternative with O in position 3:
_ _ O E R → need letters for 1 and 2.  
Try “B I O E R” – no.  
Try “T I O E R” – no.  
Try “T R O E R” – repeats R.  
Try “D I O E R” – no.  
“D R O E R” – repeats R.  
“M I O E R” – no.  
“M O” – already O in 3.  
Seems “LONER” is the best.

Thus, next guess: “LONER”.

- O is somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3
- Letters already ruled out: A, C, L, N, S, W

Plausible pattern:
[?] [?] O E R  (O must be in position 3)
or
[?] O [?] E R  (O in position 2)
or
O [?] [?] E R  (O in position 1)

Pattern: _ _ O E R
Need two letters for positions 1 and 2, not in ruled-out set.
Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, T, Y, Z
Try common combinations:
- D O G E R → DOGER (not a valid word)
- F O G E R → FOGER (valid word, though rare)
- H O G E R → HOGER (not standard)
- M O G E R → MOGER (not valid)
- P O G E R → POGER (not valid)
- B O G E R → BOGER (not valid)

Try O in position 2:
Pattern: _ O _ E R
Need letters 1 and 3. Good options:
- B O D E R → BODER (not valid)
- F O G E R → FOGER (same as above)
- H O D E R → HODER (not valid)
- M O D E R → MODER (valid word)

Check MODER:
- M, O, D, E, R → no ruled-out letters
- E in position 4 ✓
- R in position 5 ✓
- O in position 2 ✓
- M and D are new letters

This seems optimal.

Alternative with O in position 1:

- O M D E R → OMDER (not valid)
- O D I E R → ODIER (not valid)

   - K… – nothing obvious  
   - POGER – invalid  
   - TOGER – invalid  

2. _ O _ E R → Need letters 1 and 3.  
   Usable letters again the same set.  
   - B O D E R – invalid (D already out)  
   - F O G E R – valid and fairly common  
   - H O G E R – invalid  
   - K O G E R – invalid  
   - T O G E R – invalid  
   - F O G E R is the only clean candidate here.

3. _ _ O E R → Need letters 1 and 2.  
   - B I O E R – invalid (I is vowel, and we haven’t ruled it out, but…)  
   - T I O E R – invalid  
   - K I O E R – invalid  
   - G I O E R – invalid  
   - B O is already in 1, but O is in 3 here.  
   - Actually, we could try B I O E R but it’s not a standard word.  
   - No clearly valid common word pops out.

Thus the best remaining valid and common word that fits all constraints is FOGER.

Check: F, O, G, E, R  
- No eliminated letters.  
- E in 4 ✓  
- R in 5 ✓  
- O in 2 ✓  
- F and G are new letters we haven’t tested yet.

The feedback on FORGER says “Model answer is not five letters,” which is a bit ambiguous, but it clearly indicates that “forger” is not the correct word.  
However, we already know:
- Positions 4 and 5 are E R.  
- O is somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.  
- Letters already ruled out: A, C, L, M, N, S, W, D.  

We still need two more distinct letters (not O, E, R) for the open spots.  
Let’s re-examine the viable patterns with fresh eyes.

Pattern 2: _ O _ E R  
We need a letter for position 1 and a letter for position 3, both not in the banned set.  
Usable consonants left: B, F, G, H, K, P, T, Y, Z  
Usable vowels left: I, U (since A is out and E is already placed)

Try common consonant+vowel combos:
- B O I E R → BOIER – not a word  
- F O I E R → FOIER – not a word  
- G O I E R → GOIER – not a word  
- H O I E R → HOIER – not a word  
- T O I E R → TOIER – not a word  

Try vowel+consonant:
- I O _ E R → need a consonant for position 3.  
  - I O B E R → IBOER – not valid  
  - I O G E R → IGOER – not valid  
  - I O T E R → ITOER – not valid  

Try different consonants:
- H O G E R – invalid (G is okay, but word not common)  
- T O G E R – invalid  
- B O G E R – invalid  
- K O G E R – invalid  

Wait – we overlooked a simple valid word:  
- B O X E R – valid word “BOXER” (as in boxer gloves)  
Check constraints:  
B, O, X, E, R  
- No banned letters (A, C, L, M, N, S, W, D are all absent).  
- E in 4 ✓  
- R in 5 ✓  
- O in 2 ✓  
- B and X are new letters.  

“BOXER” is a valid 5-letter word that satisfies every constraint.
