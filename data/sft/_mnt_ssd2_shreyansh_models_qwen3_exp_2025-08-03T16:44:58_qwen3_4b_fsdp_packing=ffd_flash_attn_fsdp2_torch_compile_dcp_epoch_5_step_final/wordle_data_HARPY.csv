### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum information about which letters might be in the secret word. 

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"", but since I can only choose one, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for its vowel coverage.

- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, E are not in the word at all.

- Does not contain O, S, or E.
- Must have 5 letters.

I need a word that:
1. Has A and R.

3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places R somewhere other than position 2.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and O, E are out).

Let’s try a word that uses A and R in different positions and introduces new common letters. ""TRAIN"" comes to mind:
- T (new letter)
- R (but not in position 2)
- A (not in position 1)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum information about which letters might be in the secret word. 

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"", but since I can only choose one, I'll go with ""AROSE"" for its vowel coverage.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R somewhere (but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively).
- Does not contain O, S, or E.
- Must have 5 letters.

I need a word that:
1. Has A and R.
2. Doesn’t use O, S, E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places R somewhere other than position 2.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, D, C, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and O, E are out).

Let’s try a word that uses A and R in different positions and introduces new common letters. ""TRAIN"" comes to mind:
- T (new letter)
- R (but not in position 2)
- A (not in position 1)
- I (new vowel)
- N (new letter)

This should give us more information about possible positions for A and R and test new letters.

Guess 2: train -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O, S, E are absent.

2. train → T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T, I, N are absent.
   - R is still present but not in position 2.
   - A is still present but not in position 3 (because in “train” it got “-” again).

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R.
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- R cannot be in position 2.
- Excludes: O, S, E, T, I, N.

Remaining useful letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.
We still need to test positions for A and R and gather more consonants.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Places A in position 2, 4, or 5 (since 1 and 3 are ruled out).
- Places R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 (since 2 is ruled out).
- Introduces new common consonants.

A good candidate is “BARDY”:
- B (new)
- A (position 2)
- R (position 3)
- D (new)
- Y (new)

This tests A in position 2 and R in position 3, while adding three new letters.

Good candidates:

- H A R _ Y: HARPY (HARPY is a valid word, means hawk)

HARPY is valid and uses H, which hasn’t been tested.

HARPY is a valid word.
