### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback. Common starting letters in 5-letter words include S, T, R, N, L, and vowels like A, E, I, O, U.

A good first guess should cover a mix of these common consonants and vowels. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""RAISE"" are popular choices. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which gives a good balance to test multiple letters at once.

Current confirmed information:

So N must be in position 5 (since it can’t be 1,2,3,4 from all feedback).

Thus the pattern is:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback. Common starting letters in 5-letter words include S, T, R, N, L, and vowels like A, E, I, O, U.

A good first guess should cover a mix of these common consonants and vowels. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""RAISE"" are popular choices. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which gives a good balance to test multiple letters at once.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position (not 4th).
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and S.
- It does NOT contain R, O, E.
- A is not in position 1, S is not in position 4.

Good letters to try next: remaining vowels (I, U) and common consonants not yet ruled out (T, N, L, C, D, etc.).  
We also want to test new positions for A and S.

A useful next guess is “STAIN”:
- S is now in position 1 (since it can’t be in 4th).
- A is now in position 2 (since it can’t be in 1st).
- T, I, N are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
This maximizes information gain while respecting the constraints.

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. STAIN → S(✓) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(-)
   - S is in the correct position (position 1).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - N is in the word but not in position 5.
   - T and I are not in the word.

So far we know:
- S is fixed in position 1.
- A is in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- N is in the word but cannot be in position 5.
- Letters ruled out so far: R, O, E, T, I.

Remaining common letters not yet tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains A (positions 2, 4, or 5).
- Contains N (positions 2, 3, or 4).
- Does not contain R, O, E, T, I.

A straightforward candidate is “SHANK”:
- S ✓ in position 1.
- H new letter.
- A in position 3 (but we know A can’t be in 3 from STAIN feedback). So this is invalid.

Next try “SPANK”:
- S ✓.
- P new.
- A in position 3 → again invalid.

Try “SWANK”:
- S ✓.
- W new.
- A in position 3 → invalid.

Try “SNACK”:
- S ✓.
- N in position 2 (valid).
- A in position 3 → invalid.

Try “SALON”:
- S ✓.
- A in position 2 (valid).
- L new.
- O is ruled out → invalid.

Try “SANER”:
- S ✓.
- A in position 2.
- N in position 3 (valid).
- E is ruled out → invalid.

Try “SANDY”:
- S ✓.
- A in position 2.
- N in position 3.
- D, Y new.
This satisfies all constraints:
- S in 1 ✓.
- A not in 1 or 3 → it’s in 2 ✓.

- S is confirmed in position 1.
- N is confirmed in position 4.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from SLANG feedback).
- L and G are not in the word.

Combining with earlier information:
- Pattern: S A _ N _
- A must be in position 2 (since it can't be in 1, 3, or 5 and is confirmed in 2 by SANDY).
- N is in position 4 (confirmed by SLANG).
- Letters ruled out so far: R, O, E, T, I, D, Y, L, G.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback. Common starting letters in 5-letter words include S, T, R, N, L, and vowels like A, E, I, O, U.

A good first guess should cover a mix of these common consonants and vowels. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""RAISE"" are popular choices. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which gives a good balance to test multiple letters at once.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position (not 4th).
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and S.
- It does NOT contain R, O, E.
- A is not in position 1, S is not in position 4.

Good letters to try next: remaining vowels (I, U) and common consonants not yet ruled out (T, N, L, C, D, etc.).  
We also want to test new positions for A and S.

A useful next guess is “STAIN”:
- S is now in position 1 (since it can’t be in 4th).
- A is now in position 2 (since it can’t be in 1st).
- T, I, N are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
This maximizes information gain while respecting the constraints.

Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. STAIN → S(✓) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(-)
   - S is in the correct position (position 1).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - N is in the word but not in position 5.
   - T and I are not in the word.

So far we know:
- S is fixed in position 1.
- A is in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
- N is in the word but cannot be in position 5.
- Letters ruled out so far: R, O, E, T, I.

Remaining common letters not yet tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.
- Contains A (positions 2, 4, or 5).
- Contains N (positions 2, 3, or 4).
- Does not contain R, O, E, T, I.

A straightforward candidate is “SHANK”:
- S ✓ in position 1.
- H new letter.
- A in position 3 (but we know A can’t be in 3 from STAIN feedback). So this is invalid.

Next try “SPANK”:
- S ✓.
- P new.
- A in position 3 → again invalid.

Try “SWANK”:
- S ✓.
- W new.
- A in position 3 → invalid.

Try “SNACK”:
- S ✓.
- N in position 2 (valid).
- A in position 3 → invalid.

Try “SALON”:
- S ✓.
- A in position 2 (valid).
- L new.
- O is ruled out → invalid.

Try “SANER”:
- S ✓.
- A in position 2.
- N in position 3 (valid).
- E is ruled out → invalid.

Try “SANDY”:
- S ✓.
- A in position 2.
- N in position 3.
- D, Y new.
This satisfies all constraints:
- S in 1 ✓.
- A not in 1 or 3 → it’s in 2 ✓.
- N not in 5 → it’s in 3 ✓.
- No R, O, E, T, I → ✓.

Let’s use SANDY.

Guess 3: SANDY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) N(-) D(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current confirmed information:
- S is fixed in position 1.
- A is fixed in position 2.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 5 (from STAIN and SANDY feedback).
- Letters ruled out so far: R, O, E, T, I, D, Y.

So the pattern so far is:
S A _ _ _  
with N somewhere in positions 4 or 5 (since it can’t be 1, 2, 3, or 5 from SANDY feedback, wait that’s conflicting… let me re-read the feedback carefully).

Wait, the feedback for SANDY:
S(✓) A(✓) N(-) D(x) Y(x)
means:
- S is correct in position 1.
- A is correct in position 2.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- D and Y are not in the word.

From STAIN:
S(✓) T(x) A(-) I(x) N(-)
we had:
- S in position 1 ✓
- A was in position 3 but marked (-) so A is in word but not position 3
- N was in position 4 but marked (-) so N is in word but not position 4

From SANDY:
S(✓) A(✓) N(-) D(x) Y(x)
- S ✓ position 1
- A ✓ position 2
- N is in word but not position 3

So N must be in position 5 (since it can’t be 1,2,3,4 from all feedback).

Thus the pattern is:
S A _ _ N

Letters left to fill: positions 3 and 4, using letters not yet ruled out (B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, etc.).

Common 5-letter words fitting S A _ _ N:
- SCAR N → but R is ruled out
- SWANK → but K is possible, W is possible
- SHANK → H and K are possible
- SPANK → P and K are possible
- SLANG → but G is possible, L is possible, but N is in position 5 ✓

Let me try SLANG:
- S ✓
- A ✓
- N in position 5 ✓
- L new
- G new
This fits all constraints.

Another candidate is SHAWN:
- S ✓
- A ✓
- W new
- H new
- N in position 5 ✓

Between these, SLANG seems straightforward.

Let’s use SLANG.

The feedback for SAWN says “Model answer is not five letters,” so SAWN is not considered a valid 5-letter word for this puzzle.  
I must find another valid English 5-letter word that fits the pattern S A _ N _ and uses only the still-allowed letters (B, C, F, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, etc.).

Looking again:
- S A C N _ → SACNE, SACNU, etc. – none are valid.
- S A P N _ → PNAS_ no.
- S A U N _ → SAUNE, SAUNK, SAUNP – none.
- S A M N _ → SAMNE – invalid.
- S A K N _ → SAKNU – invalid.
- S A B N _ → SABN_ – invalid.

The only common valid word left is S A U N A, but that repeats A in position 5, and A is already known to be in position 2.  
Another check: S A U N A is 5 letters, but its validity depends on the dictionary; it’s a valid word (variant spelling of “souza” or “saura,” but more commonly “sauan” isn’t valid).

Wait – let me list all valid English 5-letter words matching S A _ N _:
- S A U N A – valid (rare variant, but accepted in Scrabble lists)
- S A U N T – but T is ruled out
- S A N N Y – Y is ruled out
- S A U N A seems to be the only remaining candidate.

However, A is already fixed in position 2, and N in position 4, so the word must be S A _ N _.  
The only valid word fitting this exactly is S A U N A.

But let me double-check: is S A U N A a valid 5-letter English word? Yes, it is (an old spelling of “sauvage” or “sauva,” and accepted in some Scrabble dictionaries).

Therefore, the next logical guess is S A U N A.
