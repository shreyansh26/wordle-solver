### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word should have a mix of vowels and consonants, and ideally include letters that appear frequently in English words. 

One of the most effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common ending letter
- E: Most common vowel in English

This gives me a good coverage of possible letters and positions to work with.

Current known facts:

3. Contains L, and L cannot be in position 2

Example candidates:

- S C L A T (contains A, ruled out)
- S L I N T (I, N allowed; L in position 2 is disallowed because L cannot be in position 2 per feedback)
- S L U N T (L in position 2 again, disallowed)
- S W I L T (I, W allowed; L in position 4 is allowed)

From the latest feedback on SWILT:

S(✓) W(x) I(✓) L(✓) T(✓)

We now know the exact pattern:

S _ I L T

- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 2: must be a letter that is NOT W (and also not A, E, P, O, R, etc. already ruled out)
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- Position 4: L (fixed)
- Position 5: T (fixed)

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with S, has I in position 3, L in position 4, T in position 5, and has a valid letter in position 2.

Letters already ruled out: A, E, P, O, R, W

Remaining common consonants for position 2: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, Q, V, X, Y, Z

Looking for real words fitting S _ I L T:

- SCILT - not a valid word
- SDILT - not valid
- SFILT - not valid
- SGILT - not valid
- SHILT - not valid
- SKILT - not valid
- SMILT - not valid
- SNILT - not valid
- STILT - valid (though rare, ""stilt"" is an acceptable word)
- SUILT - not valid
- etc.

The only common valid word fitting this pattern is STILT.

Let me verify: S T I L T

- S(✓) T(?) I(✓) L(✓) T(✓)

We know T is in the word (from SLATE feedback), and here it appears again in position 2. This is acceptable because the feedback only said T was in the word but not necessarily that T couldn't appear multiple times. However, let's check if STILT is a valid word - yes, it is (a stilt is a type of wooden pole).

But wait - in SLATE feedback, T was marked as ""in word but wrong position"" (feedback was T(-)), which meant T was present but not in position 4. In STILT, T is in position 2, which hasn't been ruled out.

Another candidate: sometimes ""shilt"" is used colloquially, but it's not standard.

Thus, the most plausible valid word is STILT.
