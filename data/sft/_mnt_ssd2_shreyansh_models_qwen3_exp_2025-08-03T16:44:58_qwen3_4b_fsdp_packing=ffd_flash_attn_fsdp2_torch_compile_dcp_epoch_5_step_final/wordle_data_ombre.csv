### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should have a mix of these vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include:
- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E (position 5).
- Contains R and O, but not in positions 2 or 3 respectively.
- Does not contain A or S.

Letters we know: R, O, E (with E fixed at position 5).
Letters we can rule out: A, S.

Next guess should:
1. Keep E in position 5.
2. Try R and O in new positions (not 2 for R, not 3 for O).
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested.

Good candidates:
- CREPE (but P not tested, C not tested, but has two Es which might be risky).
- TROPE (T, R, O, P, E) – uses E in correct spot, moves R to 2 (but R cannot be in 2), so invalid.
- ROATE (but A is ruled out).
- ENTER (but N, T, R – R is in 3, which is allowed since R only cannot be in 2).
- ORATE (A ruled out).

Better choice: ""ENTER"" – uses E in 5, moves R to 3 (allowed), O is not used here, but we need to test new letters. Actually, we should prioritize moving R and O to new positions.

Alternative: ""ROUTE"" – R in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), U and T new, E in 5. This seems good.

Another: ""DROVE"" – D, R, O, V, E. R in 2 (not allowed), so invalid.

Best: ""ROUTE"" – satisfies all constraints and introduces new letters.

But let's double-check:
- R is in word, must not be in position 2 (from feedback). In ROUTE, R is in 2 – so this is invalid.

Next: ""TROPE"" – R in 2 – invalid.

""PROVE"" – R in 2 – invalid.

""GRAPE"" – A ruled out.

""CRONE"" – C, R, O, N, E. R in 2 – invalid.

""FRONT"" – ends with T, not E.

""STORE"" – S ruled out.

""BROKE"" – B, R, O, K, E. R in 2 – invalid.

""VOICE"" – ends with E, but I and C are new. V, I, C – but O needs to be used.

""VIOLÉ"" – uses O in 3, which is invalid.

""JOKER"" – ends with R, not E.

""FORCE"" – ends with E, F and C new. R in 3 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed). This seems valid.

Check F, O, R, C, E:
- E is in 5 (correct).
- R is in 3 (allowed, since R only forbidden in 2).
- O is in 2 (allowed, since O only forbidden in 3).
- F and C are new letters.

Thus, ""FORCE"" is a good next guess.

Another valid option: ""MOTOR"" – ends with R, invalid.

""POKER"" – ends with R, invalid.

""GORED"" – ends with D, invalid.

""BORED"" – ends with D, invalid.

""COVER"" – ends with R, invalid.

""WORSE"" – S ruled out.

""FROZE"" – Z new, but R in 2 – invalid.

""MOVER"" – ends with R, invalid.

""YOKER"" – ends with R, invalid.

""ZONER"" – ends with R, invalid.

""ORDER"" – ends with R, invalid.

""PERKY"" – ends with Y, invalid.

""CHORE"" – ends with E, C, H, O, R. R in 5, which is allowed. O in 3 – but O cannot be in 3 (from feedback). So invalid.

""CHORE"" – O in 3 – invalid.

""PIECE"" – ends with E, but O and R must be used.

""BRIEF"" – ends with F, invalid.

""THREW"" – ends with W, invalid.

""WRITE"" – ends with E, W, R, I, T. R in 3 (allowed), O must be used. So missing O.

""WRITE"" – invalid, missing O.

""FROND"" – ends with D, invalid.

""ROGUE"" – ends with E, but R in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), G, U new. This seems valid.

Check:
- E in 5: ✓
- R in 1: allowed (only 2 was forbidden)
- O in 2: allowed (only 3 was forbidden)
- G and U are new letters

Thus, ""ROGUE"" is another good option.

Between ""FORCE"" and ""ROGUE"", both seem valid. ""FORCE"" uses F and C, ""ROGUE"" uses G and U. Both are reasonable. I'll go with ""FORCE"".

But let's re-examine the feedback: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓). So:
- R is in word, not in position 2.
- O is in word, not in position 3.
- E is in position 5.

So in ""FORCE"":
- F (new)
- O (position 2, allowed)
- R (position 3, allowed)
- C (new)
- E (position 5, correct)

This satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is ""FORCE"".

The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should have a mix of these vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include:\n- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E)\n- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)\n- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)\n- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)\n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(x) → A is not in the word.\n- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.\n- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.\n- S(x) → S is not in the word.\n- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.\n\nSo far we know:\n- Word ends with E (position 5).\n- Contains R and O, but not in positions 2 or 3 respectively.\n- Does not contain A or S.\n\nLetters we know: R, O, E (with E fixed at position 5).\nLetters we can rule out: A, S.\n\nNext guess should:\n1.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. E is fixed in position 5.
2. The word contains R and O, but:
   - R cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
   - O cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
3. Letters that have been ruled out: A, S, F, C.

So R and O must occupy positions 1, 4 (only remaining open spots), or possibly 2/3 if the other letter fills the remaining slot, but their positions are still constrained.

We need a word that:
- Ends with E
- Uses R and O exactly once each
- Uses no forbidden letters (A, S, F, C)
- Places R and O in allowed positions (R not 2/3, O not 2/3)

Remaining common letters we can still use: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s list possible placements:
- If R is in position 1, then O must be in 4, and the middle two letters must be from the allowed set.
- If O is in position 1, then R must be in 4, and the middle two letters must be from the allowed set.
- R and O could also both be in position 4, but that’s impossible (only one E at 5).

So the word structure must be either:
1. R _ _ O E
2. O _ _ R E

We need to pick the first valid word we can find with allowed letters.

Check R _ _ O E:
Possible second letter: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y
Third letter: same list, different from second.

Example:
R I V O E – but “RIVOE” is not a valid English word.
R A I O E – A ruled out.
R O – already used.
R E – already used.

Try O _ _ R E:
O B I R E – “OBIRE” not valid.
O M B R E – “OMBRE” is valid.

Check constraints:
- O in 1 (allowed)
- M (new)
- B (new)
- R in 4 (allowed)
- E in 5 (fixed)

“OMBRE” uses only allowed letters and respects all positional constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is “OMBRE”.
