### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-1 consonants to cover common patterns. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), while also being a valid 5-letter word. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So:
- Letters to avoid: A, R, S, E
- We know O is somewhere in the word, but not in position 3.
- We still have 4 other positions to fill with new letters.

Good next steps:
1. Keep O but move it to a new position (1, 2, 4, or 5).
2. Introduce new common letters not yet tested (T, N, L, C, D, etc.).

A strong candidate is ""TONIC"":

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: A, R, S, E
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. TONIC → T(x) O(-) N(x) I(-) C(x)
   - Letters not in the word: T, N, C (added to A, R, S, E)
   - O is still in the word but not in position 2 (from TONIC) or 3 (from AROSE). So O must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.

We know:
- The word contains O and I.
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions 1, 4, 5.
- I cannot be in position 4 → possible positions 1, 2, 3, 5.
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, E, T, N, C.

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word with:
- O and I somewhere (positions constrained above)
- Other letters from the remaining pool.

Let’s try to place O in position 1 and I in position 2: O I _ _ _
Possible words: OILYM, OILSK… but OILSK isn’t valid. OILYM isn’t a word. Let’s try another combination.

Place O in position 4: _ _ _ O _
Place I in position 2: _ I _ O _
Possible pattern: _ I _ O _
Try common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, etc.

Consider ""DIMPY"":
- D, M, P, Y not yet tested.
- I in position 2, O missing – no O.
Not valid.

Consider ""FOULY"":
- F, U, L, Y not tested.
- O in position 3 – ruled out.

Consider ""GUMMY"":
- G, U, M, Y.
- No O or I – missing required letters.

Consider ""MIXED"":
- I, X, D – but E is ruled out.

Consider ""PIVOT"":
- P, V, T – but T is ruled out.

Consider ""LOBIO"":
- L, B, I, O – but O in position 5 is allowed, I in position 4 is allowed.
Check if LOBIO is a valid word: yes, it’s a variant spelling of ""lobes"" in some dialects/Scrabble lists, but may not be common.

Consider ""POLYP"":
- P, L, Y, P.
- O in position 1, I missing.

Consider ""VOGUE"":
- V, G, U, E – E ruled out.

Consider ""WIDOW"":
- W, I, D, O – but O in position 4 is allowed, I in position 2 is allowed.
Check if WIDOW is valid: yes.

Letters used: W, I, D, O, W – all allowed (W not yet ruled out), and it satisfies constraints:
- O in position 4 (allowed)
- I in position 2 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters.

So ""WIDOW"" seems valid.

But let me try a more straightforward word. Consider ""DIOXY"" – but not a valid word.

Consider ""OLIVE"":
- O, L, I, V, E – E ruled out.

Consider ""OZONE"":
- O, Z, O, N, E – N and E ruled out.

Consider ""BOWIE"":
- B, O, W, I, E – E ruled out.

Consider ""BOXING"":
- Too long.

Consider ""FOILS"":
- F, O, I, L, S – S ruled out.

Consider ""GOOFY"":
- G, O, O, F, Y – O in position 2 and 3 – but O can’t be in position 2 (from TONIC feedback). So invalid.

Consider ""HOIST"":
- H, O, I, S, T – S and T ruled out.

Consider ""JOINT"":
- J, O, I, N, T – N and T ruled out.

Consider ""LOBED"":
- L, O, B, E, D – E ruled out.

Consider ""LOGIC"":
- L, O, G, I, C – C ruled out.

Consider ""LODGE"":
- L, O, D, G, E – E ruled out.

Consider ""LIMBO"":
- L, I, M, B, O – O in position 5 (allowed), I in position 2 (allowed), no forbidden letters.
Check if LIMBO is valid: yes.

So ""LIMBO"" is another valid candidate.

Between WIDOW and LIMBO, both fit, but LIMBO uses more distinct letters (L, I, M, B, O) compared to WIDOW (W, I, D, O, W). Let’s go with LIMBO.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-1 consonants to cover common patterns. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), while also being a valid 5-letter word. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: A, R, S, E
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. TONIC → T(x) O(-) N(x) I(-) C(x)
   - Letters not in the word: T, N, C (added to A, R, S, E)
   - O is still in the word but not in position 2 (from TONIC) or 3 (from AROSE). So O must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.

We know:
- The word contains O and I.
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → possible positions 1, 4, 5.
- I cannot be in position 4 → possible positions 1, 2, 3, 5.
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, E, T, N, C.

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word with:
- O and I somewhere (positions constrained above)
- Other letters from the remaining pool.

Let’s try to place O in position 1 and I in position 2: O I _ _ _
Possible words: OILYM, OILSK… but OILSK isn’t valid. OILYM isn’t a word. Let’s try another combination.

Place O in position 4: _ _ _ O _
Place I in position 2: _ I _ O _
Possible pattern: _ I _ O _
Try common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, etc.

Consider ""DIMPY"":
- D, M, P, Y not yet tested.
- I in position 2, O missing – no O.
Not valid.

Consider ""FOULY"":
- F, U, L, Y not tested.
- O in position 3 – ruled out.

Consider ""GUMMY"":
- G, U, M, Y.
- No O or I – missing required letters.

Consider ""MIXED"":
- I, X, D – but E is ruled out.

Consider ""PIVOT"":
- P, V, T – but T is ruled out.

Consider ""LOBIO"":
- L, B, I, O – but O in position 5 is allowed, I in position 4 is allowed.
Check if LOBIO is a valid word: yes, it’s a variant spelling of ""lobes"" in some dialects/Scrabble lists, but may not be common.

Consider ""POLYP"":
- P, L, Y, P.
- O in position 1, I missing.

Consider ""VOGUE"":
- V, G, U, E – E ruled out.

Consider ""WIDOW"":
- W, I, D, O – but O in position 4 is allowed, I in position 2 is allowed.
Check if WIDOW is valid: yes.

Letters used: W, I, D, O, W – all allowed (W not yet ruled out), and it satisfies constraints:
- O in position 4 (allowed)
- I in position 2 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters.

So ""WIDOW"" seems valid.

But let me try a more straightforward word. Consider ""DIOXY"" – but not a valid word.

Consider ""OLIVE"":
- O, L, I, V, E – E ruled out.

Consider ""OZONE"":
- O, Z, O, N, E – N and E ruled out.

Consider ""BOWIE"":
- B, O, W, I, E – E ruled out.

Consider ""BOXING"":
- Too long.

Consider ""FOILS"":
- F, O, I, L, S – S ruled out.

Consider ""GOOFY"":
- G, O, O, F, Y – O in position 2 and 3 – but O can’t be in position 2 (from TONIC feedback). So invalid.

Consider ""HOIST"":
- H, O, I, S, T – S and T ruled out.

Consider ""JOINT"":
- J, O, I, N, T – N and T ruled out.

Consider ""LOBED"":
- L, O, B, E, D – E ruled out.

Consider ""LOGIC"":
- L, O, G, I, C – C ruled out.

Consider ""LODGE"":
- L, O, D, G, E – E ruled out.

Consider ""LIMBO"":
- L, I, M, B, O – O in position 5 (allowed), I in position 2 (allowed), no forbidden letters.
Check if LIMBO is valid: yes.

So ""LIMBO"" is another valid candidate.

Between WIDOW and LIMBO, both fit, but LIMBO uses more distinct letters (L, I, M, B, O) compared to WIDOW (W, I, D, O, W). Let’s go with LIMBO.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   – Eliminated letters: A, R, S, E  
   – O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. TONIC → T(x) O(-) N(x) I(-) C(x)
   – Eliminated letters add: T, N, C  
   – O is in the word but not in position 2.  
   – I is in the word but not in position 4.

3. LIMBO → L(x) I(-) M(-) B(x) O(-)
   – Eliminated letters add: L, B  
   – I is in the word but not in position 2.  
   – M is in the word but not in position 3.  
   – O is in the word but not in position 5.

Summary of constraints:
- Must contain: O, I, M  
- Cannot contain: A, R, S, E, T, N, C, L, B  
- O cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5  
- I cannot be in positions 2, 4  
- M cannot be in position 3

Possible positions:
- O: only positions 1 or 4 (since 2,3,5 are ruled out)  
- I: positions 1, 3, or 5 (since 2,4 are ruled out)  
- M: positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since 3 is ruled out)

Remaining usable letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word with O, I, M and two other distinct letters from the remaining pool, satisfying the positional constraints.

Let’s test possible placements:

Case 1: O in position 1
Pattern: O _ _ _ _
I must be in 3 or 5
M must be in 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3)
Subcase 1.1: I in 3 → O _ I _ _
   M must be in 2 or 4 or 5.  
   - M in 2 → O M I _ _ → need two letters from remaining.  
     Possible: O M I D Y → OMI DY → not a word.  
     O M I G A → A eliminated.  
     O M I G Y → OMIGY – not valid.  
   - M in 4 → O _ I M _ → O D I M Y → ODIMY – not valid.  
   - M in 5 → O _ I M → O D I M – too short.

Subcase 1.2: I in 5 → O _ _ _ I
   M must be in 2, 4, or 3 (but 3 is allowed for M now).  
   - M in 3 → O _ M _ I → O D M Y I → ODMYI – not valid.  
   - M in 2 → O M _ _ I → O M D Y I → OMDYI – not valid.  
   - M in 4 → O _ _ M I → O D Y M I →ODYMI – not valid.

Case 2: O in position 4
Pattern: _ _ _ O _
I must be in 1, 3, or 5  
M must be in 1, 2, or 5 (since 3 is ruled out for M)

Subcase 2.1: I in 1 → I _ _ O _
   M must be in 2 or 5 (since 3 is ruled out for M)  
   - M in 2 → I M _ O _ → I M D Y O → IMDY O → IM DY O – not valid.  
   - M in 5 → I _ _ O M → I D Y O M → IDYOM – not valid.

Subcase 2.2: I in 3 → _ _ I O _
   M must be in 1 or 2 or 5 (since 3 is ruled out for M)  
   - M in 1 → M _ I O _ → M D Y I O – not valid.  
   - M in 2 → _ M I O _ → D M I O Y – not valid.  
   - M in 5 → _ _ I O M → D Y I O M – not valid.

Subcase 2.3: I in 5 → _ _ _ O I
   M must be in 1, 2, or 3 (since 3 is allowed for M now)  
   - M in 1 → M _ _ O I → M D Y O I – not valid.  
   - M in 2 → _ M _ O I → D M Y O I – not valid.  
   - M in 3 → _ _ M O I → D Y M O I – not valid.

None of the above combinations with letters D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z seem to form valid English words. This suggests we might need to use a letter we haven’t eliminated yet in a different combination.

Let’s try O in position 1, I in position 3, and M in position 4:
Pattern: O _ I M _
Letters left: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible: O D I M Y → ODIMY – not valid.
O D I M P → ODIMP – not valid.
O F I M Y → OFIMY – not valid.

Another try: O in position 4, I in position 1, M in position 2:
Pattern: I M _ O _
Possible: I M D O Y → IMD OY – not valid.
I M P O Y → IMP OY – not valid.

Let’s try with more common letters: O in position 1, I in position 5, M in position 2:
Pattern: O M _ _ I
Possible: O M D Y I → OM DYI – not valid.

Wait, let’s try O in position 4, I in position 3, M in position 1:
Pattern: M _ I O _
Possible: M D I O Y → MDIOY – not valid.

Another combination: O in position 1, I in position 3, M in position 2:
Pattern: O M I _ _
Letters left: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible: O M I D Y → OMIDY – not valid.
O M I G A → A eliminated.
O M I G Y → OMIGY – not valid.
O M I N T → N, T eliminated.
O M I D A → A eliminated.
O M I D O → duplicate O, but O is already used.

Let’s try O in position 4, I in position 1, M in position 5:
Pattern: I _ _ O M
Possible: I D Y O M → IDYOM – not valid.

Another try: O in position 1, I in position 3, M in position 5:
Pattern: O _ I _ M
Possible: O D I Y M → ODYIM – not valid.

- O is in position 1 (allowed, since O cannot be in 2,3,5).
- I is in position 3 (allowed, since I cannot be in 2,4).

After exhausting many combinations, let me try a different approach: look for actual English words that contain O, I, M with the given constraints.

Possible English words with O, I, M:
- MIMOS – but O is in position 3 and 4, which is ruled out.
- MOMIS – not valid.
- OIMAS – not valid.
- OMICS – not valid.
- OMINI – contains O, M, I, N, I – N is eliminated.
- OPIUM – P is allowed, U is allowed, M is allowed, I is allowed, U is allowed. Check constraints:
   O(1), P, I(3), U, M(5).
   - O in position 1: allowed (cannot be 2,3,5).
   - I in position 3: allowed (cannot be 2,4).
   - M in position 5: allowed (cannot be 3).
   - Letters used: O, P, I, U, M – none are eliminated.
   - This is a valid English word.

Let me verify:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (1) – but wait, the feedback said O is in the word but not in positions 2,3,5. So O could be in 1 or 4.
- In OPIUM, O is in position 1, which is allowed.
- I is in position 3: allowed (cannot be 2,4).
- M is in position 5: allowed (cannot be 3).
- P and U are new letters not yet tested.
- No eliminated letters are used.

Thus, OPIUM is a valid next guess.

</think>

Based on the constraints derived from all previous feedback, the word must contain O, I, and M, and cannot include any of the eliminated letters. After systematically checking possible combinations, ""OPIUM"" satisfies all the positional and lexical constraints:

- O is in position 1 (allowed)
- P and U are new letters not yet tested
- I is in position 3 (allowed)
- M is in position 5 (allowed)

<guess>OPIUM</guess>",OPIUM,"From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   – Eliminated letters: A, R, S, E  
   – O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. TONIC → T(x) O(-) N(x) I(-) C(x)
   – Eliminated letters add: T, N, C  
   – O is in the word but not in position 2.  
   – I is in the word but not in position 4.

3. LIMBO → L(x) I(-) M(-) B(x) O(-)
   – Eliminated letters add: L, B  
   – I is in the word but not in position 2.  
   – M is in the word but not in position 3.  
   – O is in the word but not in position 5.

Summary of constraints:
- Must contain: O, I, M  
- Cannot contain: A, R, S, E, T, N, C, L, B  
- O cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5  
- I cannot be in positions 2, 4  
- M cannot be in position 3

Possible positions:
- O: only positions 1 or 4 (since 2,3,5 are ruled out)  
- I: positions 1, 3, or 5 (since 2,4 are ruled out)  
- M: positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since 3 is ruled out)

Remaining usable letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word with O, I, M and two other distinct letters from the remaining pool, satisfying the positional constraints.

Let’s test possible placements:

Case 1: O in position 1
Pattern: O _ _ _ _
I must be in 3 or 5
M must be in 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3)
Subcase 1.1: I in 3 → O _ I _ _
   M must be in 2 or 4 or 5.  
   - M in 2 → O M I _ _ → need two letters from remaining.  
     Possible: O M I D Y → OMI DY → not a word.  
     O M I G A → A eliminated.  
     O M I G Y → OMIGY – not valid.  
   - M in 4 → O _ I M _ → O D I M Y → ODIMY – not valid.  
   - M in 5 → O _ I M → O D I M – too short.

Subcase 1.2: I in 5 → O _ _ _ I
   M must be in 2, 4, or 3 (but 3 is allowed for M now).  
   - M in 3 → O _ M _ I → O D M Y I → ODMYI – not valid.  
   - M in 2 → O M _ _ I → O M D Y I → OMDYI – not valid.  
   - M in 4 → O _ _ M I → O D Y M I →ODYMI – not valid.

Case 2: O in position 4
Pattern: _ _ _ O _
I must be in 1, 3, or 5  
M must be in 1, 2, or 5 (since 3 is ruled out for M)

Subcase 2.1: I in 1 → I _ _ O _
   M must be in 2 or 5 (since 3 is ruled out for M)  
   - M in 2 → I M _ O _ → I M D Y O → IMDY O → IM DY O – not valid.  
   - M in 5 → I _ _ O M → I D Y O M → IDYOM – not valid.

Subcase 2.2: I in 3 → _ _ I O _
   M must be in 1 or 2 or 5 (since 3 is ruled out for M)  
   - M in 1 → M _ I O _ → M D Y I O – not valid.  
   - M in 2 → _ M I O _ → D M I O Y – not valid.  
   - M in 5 → _ _ I O M → D Y I O M – not valid.

Subcase 2.3: I in 5 → _ _ _ O I
   M must be in 1, 2, or 3 (since 3 is allowed for M now)  
   - M in 1 → M _ _ O I → M D Y O I – not valid.  
   - M in 2 → _ M _ O I → D M Y O I – not valid.  
   - M in 3 → _ _ M O I → D Y M O I – not valid.

None of the above combinations with letters D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z seem to form valid English words. This suggests we might need to use a letter we haven’t eliminated yet in a different combination.

Let’s try O in position 1, I in position 3, and M in position 4:
Pattern: O _ I M _
Letters left: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible: O M D Y I → OM DYI – not valid.

Wait, let’s try O in position 4, I in position 3, M in position 1:
Pattern: M _ I O _
Possible: M D I O Y → MDIOY – not valid.

Another combination: O in position 1, I in position 3, M in position 2:
Pattern: O M I _ _
Letters left: D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible: O M I D Y → OMIDY – not valid.
O M I G A → A eliminated.
O M I G Y → OMIGY – not valid.

- O is in position 1 (allowed, since O cannot be in 2,3,5).

- I is in position 3: allowed (cannot be 2,4).
- M is in position 5: allowed (cannot be 3).
- P and U are new letters not yet tested.
- No eliminated letters are used.

Thus, OPIUM is a valid next guess.Based on the constraints derived from all previous feedback, the word must contain O, I, and M, and cannot include any of the eliminated letters. After systematically checking possible combinations, ""OPIUM"" satisfies all the positional and lexical constraints:

- O is in position 1 (allowed)
- P and U are new letters not yet tested
- I is in position 3 (allowed)
- M is in position 5 (allowed)",Guess 4: OPIUM -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) P(✓) I(✓) U(✓) M(✓),SUCCESS
