For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these. A good strategy is to use words with common vowels and consonants. ""AROSE"" is a great first guess because it contains 3 of the most common vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on “arose” we now know:

- A, R, O, S are **not** in the secret word at all (x).
- E is in the word but **not** in the 5th position (-).

So we must pick a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter E somewhere (but not at the end).
2. Does **not** contain A, R, O, S in any position.
3. Uses other common letters we haven’t ruled out yet.

Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I want a word that uses several of these to maximize information. “UNTIE” is a good candidate: it has E in the 4th position (so E isn’t in the 5th spot, satisfying the feedback), and uses common consonants U, N, T, I. It also avoids A, R, O, S entirely.

Another good choice would be “UNTIE”.

Current knowledge:

Letters ruled out: A, R, O, S, U, T  
Letters that must appear somewhere: E, N, I  
Positions ruled out:  
- E cannot be in position 5 (from arose) or 5 again (from untie), nor in positions 4, 3, 2, 1 (from untie). So E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4, but all these were just ruled out. Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.

From arose: E is in the word but not in position 5.  
From untie: E is in the word but not in position 5 (again). So E must be in positions 1-4, but in untie, E was in position 5 and was marked ""-"", so that confirms E is NOT in position 5.

From untie:

- N(-) – in word but not in position 2

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E, N, I  
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, U, T  
- Places E not in position 5 (already ruled out)  
- Places N not in position 2  
- Places I not in position 4  

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Let’s look for a word with E, N, I and only allowed letters. One systematic way is to pick a word where:
- E is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4  
- N is in 1, 3, 4, 5 (but 5 is allowed for N)  
- I is in 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since 4 is ruled out)  

A good candidate is ""INFER"":
- Letters: I, N, F, E, R – but R is ruled out, so this is invalid.  
Next: ""INDEX"":
- Letters: I, N, D, E, X – all allowed, and positions:
  - I in 1 (allowed)  
  - N in 2 (but N cannot be in 2 from untie) – invalid.  

Next: ""VENUE"":

- I is in 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since 4 is ruled out)  

A good candidate is ""INFER"":
- Letters: I, N, F, E, R – but R is ruled out, so this is invalid.  
Next: ""INDEX"":
- Letters: I, N, D, E, X – all allowed, and positions:
  - I in 1 (allowed)  
  - N in 2 (but N cannot be in 2 from untie) – invalid.  

Next: ""VENUE"":
- U is ruled out – invalid.  

Next: ""FENCE"":
- Letters: F, E, N, C, E – but missing I – invalid.  

Next: ""HINED"":
- Not a valid word.  

Next: ""WIELD"":
- L and D are allowed, but missing N – invalid.  

Let’s try ""VENGE"":
- V, E, N, G, E – missing I – invalid.  

Next: ""PINED"":
- P, I, N, E, D – all allowed letters, and positions:
  - P (new)  
  - I in 2 (allowed)  
  - N in 3 (allowed)  
  - E in 4 (allowed)  
  - D (new)  

This satisfies all constraints.

So I will guess ""PINED"".

Current knowledge after three guesses:

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T, P, D  
Letters that must appear somewhere: E, N, I  
Position constraints so far:
- E cannot be in positions 5 (from arose), 5 (from untie), 4 (from pined)  
- N cannot be in positions 2 (from untie), 3 (from pined)  
- I cannot be in positions 2 (from untie), 4 (from pined)  

So:
- E must be in position 1 or 2 (since positions 3, 4, 5 have been ruled out)  
- N must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (positions 2 and 3 ruled out)  
- I must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (positions 2 and 4 ruled out)  

Remaining candidate letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

We need a 5-letter word containing E, N, I, none of the ruled-out letters, and respecting the position constraints.

Let’s list possible placements:
- If E is in position 1: then N and I must be placed in positions 2,3,4,5 while respecting their constraints  
  - N cannot be in 2 or 3, so N must be 4 or 5  
  - I cannot be in 2 or 4, so I must be 3 or 5  
  - Possible combinations:  
    - E _ _ N I  
    - E _ I N _  
    - E _ I _ N  
    - E I _ N _  
    - E I _ _ N  
    - E _ _ I N  

- If E is in position 2: then N and I must be placed in positions 1,3,4,5 while respecting their constraints  
  - N cannot be 2 or 3, so N must be 1, 4, or 5  
  - I cannot be 2 or 4, so I must be 1, 3, or 5  
  - Possible combinations:  
    - _ E N I _  
    - _ E I N _  
    - _ E N _ I  
    - _ E I _ N  
    - _ E _ N I  
    - _ E _ I N  

Now let’s look for valid English words fitting these patterns with only allowed letters.

For E in position 1:
- E _ _ N I → e.g., E B I N I – not a word  
- E _ I N _ → e.g., E B I N – but needs 5 letters  
- E _ I _ N → e.g., E B I C N – not a word  
- E I _ N _ → e.g., E I G N – not a word  
- E I _ _ N → e.g., E I G H N – not a word  
- E _ _ I N → e.g., E B C I N – not a word  

For E in position 2:
- _ E N I _ → e.g., B E N I – but needs 5 letters, and letters must be allowed  
- _ E I N _ → e.g., B E I N – but needs 5 letters  
- _ E N _ I → e.g., B E N C I – but I must be in 1, 3, or 5  
- _ E I _ N → e.g., B E I C N – but N must be in 1, 4, or 5  
- _ E _ N I → e.g., B E C N I – but C is allowed, N in 4 is allowed, I in 5 is allowed  
  - Word: B E C N I → ""BECNI"" – not valid  
- _ E _ I N → e.g., B E C I N – not valid  

Let’s try different letters. The word must contain E, N, I and only allowed letters.

Let’s try ""BENCH"":
- Letters: B, E, N, C, H – missing I – invalid  
""BINGE"":
- B, I, N, G, E – all allowed letters, positions:  
  - B (new)  
  - I in 2 (but I cannot be in 2 from untie) – invalid  

""BINGE"" is invalid because I cannot be in position 2.

Next: ""VENGE"":
- V, E, N, G, E – missing I – invalid  

""JINGE"":
- J, I, N, G, E – all letters allowed, positions:  
  - J (new)  
  - I in 2 (invalid) – cannot be  

""FINED"":
- F, I, N, E, D – but D is ruled out – invalid  

""VINYL"":
- Missing E – invalid  

""KNEIN"":
- Not a word – invalid  

""INDEX"":
- X is allowed, but N is in 2 (invalid) – cannot be  

""IVEN"" (not 5 letters) – invalid  

""IVEN"" is 4 letters.

Let’s try ""BINE"" (4 letters) – invalid.

Wait, let’s re-examine possible combinations more systematically.

We need a 5-letter word with E, N, I, and only allowed letters (not A,R,O,S,U,T,P,D).

Possible remaining letters: B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Let’s list all possible words fitting the constraints.

Looking at position constraints:
E must be 1 or 2.
N must be 1,4,5.
I must be 1,3,5.

Let’s try E in position 1:
E _ _ N I
Possible letters for positions 2 and 3 from remaining set (B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z).

Looking for valid words:
""EBONY"" – contains E,B,O,N,Y – but O is ruled out – invalid  
""ECZIN"" – not a word  
""ELVIN"" – contains E,L,V,I,N – all allowed letters, positions:  
  - E in 1 (allowed)  
  - L (new)  
  - V (new)  
  - I in 4 (allowed)  
  - N in 5 (allowed)  

""ELVIN"" satisfies all constraints:
- Letters: E, L, V, I, N – none are ruled out.  
- E is in 1 (allowed)  
- N is in 5 (allowed)  
- I is in 4 (allowed)  

This seems valid.

Let me check if there are other possible words, but ""ELVIN"" appears to fit perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess is ""ELVIN"".

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these. A good strategy is to use words with common vowels and consonants. ""AROSE"" is a great first guess because it contains 3 of the most common vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on “arose” we now know:

- A, R, O, S are **not** in the secret word at all (x).
- E is in the word but **not** in the 5th position (-).

So we must pick a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter E somewhere (but not at the end).
2. Does **not** contain A, R, O, S in any position.
3. Uses other common letters we haven’t ruled out yet.

Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I want a word that uses several of these to maximize information. “UNTIE” is a good candidate: it has E in the 4th position (so E isn’t in the 5th spot, satisfying the feedback), and uses common consonants U, N, T, I. It also avoids A, R, O, S entirely.

Another good choice would be “UNTIE”.

Current knowledge:

Letters ruled out: A, R, O, S, U, T  
Letters that must appear somewhere: E, N, I  
Positions ruled out:  
- E cannot be in position 5 (from arose) or 5 again (from untie), nor in positions 4, 3, 2, 1 (from untie). So E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4, but all these were just ruled out. Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.

From arose: E is in the word but not in position 5.  
From untie: E is in the word but not in position 5 (again). So E must be in positions 1-4, but in untie, E was in position 5 and was marked ""-"", so that confirms E is NOT in position 5.

From untie:  
- U(x) – not in word  
- N(-) – in word but not in position 2  
- T(x) – not in word  
- I(-) – in word but not in position 4  
- E(-) – in word but not in position 5  

So letters we know are in the word: E, N, I  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E, N, I  
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, U, T  
- Places E not in position 5 (already ruled out)  
- Places N not in position 2  
- Places I not in position 4  

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Let’s look for a word with E, N, I and only allowed letters. One systematic way is to pick a word where:
- E is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4  
- N is in 1, 3, 4, 5 (but 5 is allowed for N)  
- I is in 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since 4 is ruled out)  

A good candidate is ""INFER"":
- Letters: I, N, F, E, R – but R is ruled out, so this is invalid.  
Next: ""INDEX"":
- Letters: I, N, D, E, X – all allowed, and positions:
  - I in 1 (allowed)  
  - N in 2 (but N cannot be in 2 from untie) – invalid.

Current knowledge after three guesses:

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T, P, D  
Letters that must appear somewhere: E, N, I  
Position constraints so far:
- E cannot be in positions 5 (from arose), 5 (from untie), 4 (from pined)  
- N cannot be in positions 2 (from untie), 3 (from pined)  
- I cannot be in positions 2 (from untie), 4 (from pined)  

So:
- E must be in position 1 or 2 (since positions 3, 4, 5 have been ruled out)  
- N must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (positions 2 and 3 ruled out)  
- I must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (positions 2 and 4 ruled out)  

Remaining candidate letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

We need a 5-letter word containing E, N, I, none of the ruled-out letters, and respecting the position constraints.

Let’s list possible placements:
- If E is in position 1: then N and I must be placed in positions 2,3,4,5 while respecting their constraints  
  - N cannot be in 2 or 3, so N must be 4 or 5  
  - I cannot be in 2 or 4, so I must be 3 or 5  
  - Possible combinations:  
    - E _ _ N I  
    - E _ I N _  
    - E _ I _ N  
    - E I _ N _  
    - E I _ _ N  
    - E _ _ I N  

- If E is in position 2: then N and I must be placed in positions 1,3,4,5 while respecting their constraints  
  - N cannot be 2 or 3, so N must be 1, 4, or 5  
  - I cannot be 2 or 4, so I must be 1, 3, or 5  
  - Possible combinations:  
    - _ E N I _  
    - _ E I N _  
    - _ E N _ I  
    - _ E I _ N  
    - _ E _ N I  
    - _ E _ I N  

Now let’s look for valid English words fitting these patterns with only allowed letters.

For E in position 1:
- E _ _ N I → e.g., E B I N I – not a word  
- E _ I N _ → e.g., E B I N – but needs 5 letters  
- E _ I _ N → e.g., E B I C N – not a word  
- E I _ N _ → e.g., E I G N – not a word  
- E I _ _ N → e.g., E I G H N – not a word  
- E _ _ I N → e.g., E B C I N – not a word  

For E in position 2:
- _ E N I _ → e.g., B E N I – but needs 5 letters, and letters must be allowed  
- _ E I N _ → e.g., B E I N – but needs 5 letters  
- _ E N _ I → e.g., B E N C I – but I must be in 1, 3, or 5  
- _ E I _ N → e.g., B E I C N – but N must be in 1, 4, or 5  
- _ E _ N I → e.g., B E C N I – but C is allowed, N in 4 is allowed, I in 5 is allowed  
  - Word: B E C N I → ""BECNI"" – not valid  
- _ E _ I N → e.g., B E C I N – not valid  

Let’s try different letters. The word must contain E, N, I and only allowed letters.

Let’s try ""BENCH"":
- Letters: B, E, N, C, H – missing I – invalid  
""BINGE"":
- B, I, N, G, E – all allowed letters, positions:  
  - B (new)  
  - I in 2 (but I cannot be in 2 from untie) – invalid  

""BINGE"" is invalid because I cannot be in position 2.

Next: ""VENGE"":
- V, E, N, G, E – missing I – invalid  

""JINGE"":
- J, I, N, G, E – all letters allowed, positions:  
  - J (new)  
  - I in 2 (invalid) – cannot be  

""FINED"":
- F, I, N, E, D – but D is ruled out – invalid  

""VINYL"":
- Missing E – invalid  

""KNEIN"":
- Not a word – invalid  

""INDEX"":
- X is allowed, but N is in 2 (invalid) – cannot be  

""IVEN"" (not 5 letters) – invalid  

""IVEN"" is 4 letters.

Let’s try ""BINE"" (4 letters) – invalid.

Wait, let’s re-examine possible combinations more systematically.

We need a 5-letter word with E, N, I, and only allowed letters (not A,R,O,S,U,T,P,D).

Possible remaining letters: B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Let’s list all possible words fitting the constraints.

Looking at position constraints:
E must be 1 or 2.
N must be 1,4,5.
I must be 1,3,5.

Let’s try E in position 1:
E _ _ N I
Possible letters for positions 2 and 3 from remaining set (B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z).

Looking for valid words:
""EBONY"" – contains E,B,O,N,Y – but O is ruled out – invalid  
""ECZIN"" – not a word  
""ELVIN"" – contains E,L,V,I,N – all allowed letters, positions:  
  - E in 1 (allowed)  
  - L (new)  
  - V (new)  
  - I in 4 (allowed)  
  - N in 5 (allowed)  

""ELVIN"" satisfies all constraints:
- Letters: E, L, V, I, N – none are ruled out.  
- E is in 1 (allowed)  
- N is in 5 (allowed)  
- I is in 4 (allowed)  

This seems valid.

Let me check if there are other possible words, but ""ELVIN"" appears to fit perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess is ""ELVIN"".

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these. A good strategy is to use words with common vowels and consonants. ""AROSE"" is a great first guess because it contains 3 of the most common vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on “arose” we now know:

- A, R, O, S are **not** in the secret word at all (x).
- E is in the word but **not** in the 5th position (-).

So we must pick a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter E somewhere (but not at the end).
2. Does **not** contain A, R, O, S in any position.
3. Uses other common letters we haven’t ruled out yet.

Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I want a word that uses several of these to maximize information. “UNTIE” is a good candidate: it has E in the 4th position (so E isn’t in the 5th spot, satisfying the feedback), and uses common consonants U, N, T, I. It also avoids A, R, O, S entirely.

Another good choice would be “UNTIE”.

From untie: E is in the word but not in position 5 (again). So E must be in positions 1-4, but in untie, E was in position 5 and was marked ""-"", so that confirms E is NOT in position 5.

From untie:  
- U(x) – not in word  
- N(-) – in word but not in position 2  
- T(x) – not in word  
- I(-) – in word but not in position 4  
- E(-) – in word but not in position 5  

So letters we know are in the word: E, N, I  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E, N, I  
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, U, T  
- Places E not in position 5 (already ruled out)  
- Places N not in position 2  
- Places I not in position 4  

Possible remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Let’s look for a word with E, N, I and only allowed letters. One systematic way is to pick a word where:
- E is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4  
- N is in 1, 3, 4, 5 (but 5 is allowed for N)  
- I is in 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since 4 is ruled out)  

A good candidate is ""INFER"":
- Letters: I, N, F, E, R – but R is ruled out, so this is invalid.  
Next: ""INDEX"":
- Letters: I, N, D, E, X – all allowed, and positions:
  - I in 1 (allowed)  
  - N in 2 (but N cannot be in 2 from untie) – invalid.  

Next: ""VENUE"":
- U is ruled out – invalid.  

Next: ""FENCE"":
- Letters: F, E, N, C, E – but missing I – invalid.  

Next: ""HINED"":
- Not a valid word.  

Next: ""WIELD"":
- L and D are allowed, but missing N – invalid.  

Let’s try ""VENGE"":
- V, E, N, G, E – missing I – invalid.  

Next: ""PINED"":
- P, I, N, E, D – all allowed letters, and positions:
  - P (new)  
  - I in 2 (allowed)  
  - N in 3 (allowed)  
  - E in 4 (allowed)  
  - D (new)  

This satisfies all constraints.

So I will guess ""PINED"".

Current knowledge after three guesses:

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T, P, D  
Letters that must appear somewhere: E, N, I  
Position constraints so far:
- E cannot be in positions 5 (from arose), 5 (from untie), 4 (from pined)  
- N cannot be in positions 2 (from untie), 3 (from pined)  
- I cannot be in positions 2 (from untie), 4 (from pined)  

So:
- E must be in position 1 or 2 (since positions 3, 4, 5 have been ruled out)  
- N must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (positions 2 and 3 ruled out)  
- I must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (positions 2 and 4 ruled out)  

Remaining candidate letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  

We need a 5-letter word containing E, N, I, none of the ruled-out letters, and respecting the position constraints.

Let’s list possible placements:
- If E is in position 1: then N and I must be placed in positions 2,3,4,5 while respecting their constraints  
  - N cannot be in 2 or 3, so N must be 4 or 5  
  - I cannot be in 2 or 4, so I must be 3 or 5  
  - Possible combinations:  
    - E _ _ N I  
    - E _ I N _  
    - E _ I _ N  
    - E I _ N _  
    - E I _ _ N  
    - E _ _ I N  

- If E is in position 2: then N and I must be placed in positions 1,3,4,5 while respecting their constraints  
  - N cannot be 2 or 3, so N must be 1, 4, or 5  
  - I cannot be 2 or 4, so I must be 1, 3, or 5  
  - Possible combinations:  
    - _ E N I _  
    - _ E I N _  
    - _ E N _ I  
    - _ E I _ N  
    - _ E _ N I  
    - _ E _ I N  

Now let’s look for valid English words fitting these patterns with only allowed letters.

For E in position 1:
- E _ _ N I → e.g., E B I N I – not a word  
- E _ I N _ → e.g., E B I N – but needs 5 letters  
- E _ I _ N → e.g., E B I C N – not a word  
- E I _ N _ → e.g., E I G N – not a word  
- E I _ _ N → e.g., E I G H N – not a word  
- E _ _ I N → e.g., E B C I N – not a word  

For E in position 2:
- _ E N I _ → e.g., B E N I – but needs 5 letters, and letters must be allowed  
- _ E I N _ → e.g., B E I N – but needs 5 letters  
- _ E N _ I → e.g., B E N C I – but I must be in 1, 3, or 5  
- _ E I _ N → e.g., B E I C N – but N must be in 1, 4, or 5  
- _ E _ N I → e.g., B E C N I – but C is allowed, N in 4 is allowed, I in 5 is allowed  
  - Word: B E C N I → ""BECNI"" – not valid  
- _ E _ I N → e.g., B E C I N – not valid  

Let’s try different letters. The word must contain E, N, I and only allowed letters.

Let’s try ""BENCH"":
- Letters: B, E, N, C, H – missing I – invalid  
""BINGE"":
- B, I, N, G, E – all allowed letters, positions:  
  - B (new)  
  - I in 2 (but I cannot be in 2 from untie) – invalid  

""BINGE"" is invalid because I cannot be in position 2.

Next: ""VENGE"":
- V, E, N, G, E – missing I – invalid  

""JINGE"":
- J, I, N, G, E – all letters allowed, positions:  
  - J (new)  
  - I in 2 (invalid) – cannot be  

""FINED"":
- F, I, N, E, D – but D is ruled out – invalid  

""VINYL"":
- Missing E – invalid  

""KNEIN"":
- Not a word – invalid  

""INDEX"":
- X is allowed, but N is in 2 (invalid) – cannot be  

""IVEN"" (not 5 letters) – invalid  

""IVEN"" is 4 letters.

Let’s try ""BINE"" (4 letters) – invalid.

Wait, let’s re-examine possible combinations more systematically.

We need a 5-letter word with E, N, I, and only allowed letters (not A,R,O,S,U,T,P,D).

Possible remaining letters: B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Let’s list all possible words fitting the constraints.

Looking at position constraints:
E must be 1 or 2.
N must be 1,4,5.
I must be 1,3,5.

Let’s try E in position 1:
E _ _ N I
Possible letters for positions 2 and 3 from remaining set (B,C,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z).

Looking for valid words:
""EBONY"" – contains E,B,O,N,Y – but O is ruled out – invalid  
""ECZIN"" – not a word  
""ELVIN"" – contains E,L,V,I,N – all allowed letters, positions:  
  - E in 1 (allowed)  
  - L (new)  
  - V (new)  
  - I in 4 (allowed)  
  - N in 5 (allowed)  

""ELVIN"" satisfies all constraints:
- Letters: E, L, V, I, N – none are ruled out.  
- E is in 1 (allowed)  
- N is in 5 (allowed)  
- I is in 4 (allowed)  

This seems valid.

Let me check if there are other possible words, but ""ELVIN"" appears to fit perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess is ""ELVIN"".

From the feedback so far:

Letters we know:
- E is in position 1 (✓)
- N is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 5 (from untie and pined)
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4 (from untie and pined)
- L, V, D are NOT in the word
- Already ruled out: A, R, O, S, U, T, P, D, L, V

So:
- Word starts with E
- Must contain N and I somewhere in positions 2-5
- N cannot be in 2, 3, 5 → must be in 4
- I cannot be in 2, 4 → must be in 3 or 5, but 5 is ruled out for I (from pined), so I must be in 3

Thus the pattern is:
E _ I N _

We need a 5-letter word starting with E, having I in 3 and N in 4, using only letters not yet ruled out.

Available letters (not ruled out): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, W, X, Y, Z

Possible words fitting E _ I N _:
- E.g., E B I N _ → ""EBIN"" + a letter, but ""EBING"" is 6 letters
- Looking for valid 5-letter words: ""EBONY"" has O (ruled out), ""ECING"" not valid
- Actually, let's think differently - we need a valid word with E _ I N _ ending

Valid word: ""EXING"" - but X is allowed, and ""EXING"" is a valid word (meaning ""to cross-examine"")

Check constraints:
- E in 1 (✓)
- X (new letter)
- I in 3 (✓)
- N in 4 (✓)
- G (new letter)

All letters used are allowed (not in the banned list).
