For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible.

One such word is ""RAISE"" - it contains R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters. This should give us good feedback on several high-frequency letters in the secret word.

We just learned that:
- R, A, I, S are NOT in the secret word (all marked x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (marked -).

So we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter E (but not in the 5th position, since that’s where it was last time).
2. Does NOT contain R, A, I, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants are T, N, L, C, D, G, M, H, etc.
A good candidate would use E plus some of these.  
“TEND” is 4 letters, so we need 5.  
“UNTIE” has I, which we already ruled out.  
“CHUTE” has U and T, but no E in a new spot.  
“UNTIE” is out (I).  
“MELON” has E in position 2, and uses M, L, O, N – none of which are ruled out yet.

Let’s try MELON.

We now know:
- Letters **not** in the word: R, A, I, S, M, L, O, N
- Letter **confirmed** in the word and in the **correct position**: E in position 2
- So the secret word is of the form: _ E _ _ _

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in the 2nd spot.
2. Uses only letters that have not been eliminated: {B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}
3. Still use common letters to maximize information.

Looking at common letters left: B, C, D, T, U, G, H, K, P.

Possible candidates:
- **CHEEK** – but has two E’s (we already used one E), and K is possible.
- **THEME** – but M is already eliminated.
- **BETEL** – but L is eliminated.
- **CETUS** – but S is eliminated.
- **DEBIT** – but I is eliminated.
- **HETEL** – L is eliminated.
- **KETTE** – T and K are still possible, but double E might be redundant.
- **TETON** – O and N are eliminated.

- **JETTY** – Y is possible, but double T might be okay.
- **PETER** – R is eliminated.
- **CETE** – too short.
- **DITED** – D and T are possible, but double E might be okay.

Actually, let's think more systematically. We need: _ E _ _ _ with remaining letters. Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Good options:

- **FETEL** – L is out.
- **GUESS** – S is out.
- **HEXEL** – X and L are possible, but L is out.

- **PETER** – R is out.
- **TWEED** – W and D are possible, but double E might be okay.
- **YETTE** – Y and T are possible, but double E might be okay.

Among these, **TWEED** uses T, W, D, and E in position 2. All letters are still possible. This seems like a good guess.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

1. The word is 5 letters.
2. The letter E is in the word, but it is **not** in positions 2, 4, or 5 (because it was in position 2 in MELON and TWEED and marked ✓ in MELON, but then marked - in TWEED, meaning it is somewhere else).
3. Letters **not** in the word at all: R, A, I, S, M, L, O, N, T, W.
4. Therefore, the word must be of the form: _ _ E _ _ (E in position 3) and must use only the remaining letters: {B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z}.
5. We need a word with E in position 3 and no other letters already eliminated.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

We need two distinct consonants for positions 1 and 2, and two distinct consonants for positions 4 and 5 (or one of them could be a duplicate, but we’ll aim for distinct letters to maximize info).

Let’s list some candidate words with E in position 3 and only allowed letters:

- B C E D ? → need 5th letter. “BCE” is 3 letters.
- C H E E ? → double E is fine, but we already know E is somewhere else.
- D E E ? → no, E is already in 3rd.
- F U E N D → “FUEND” is not a word.
- C H E E K → “CHEEK” has K and double E. K is allowed, double E is allowed since we know E is somewhere else. But we need to check if any letters are eliminated. C, H, K are allowed. So “CHEEK” is possible.
- B U E R N → “BURN” is 4 letters, “BUREN” is not common.
- P U E R T → “PUERT” is not a word.
- G U E R N → “GUE RN” is not 5 letters.
- H U E R D → not a word.
- F U E R D → not a word.
- D U E R N → not a word.
- C H E E K → valid word, uses C, H, K (all allowed), and double E (allowed since E is confirmed but not in 2,4,5, so must be in 3). This seems the best.

Another candidate: “BEEPS” but P is allowed and S is eliminated. So no.
Another: “KEYED” – Y and D are allowed, K is allowed. “KEYED” is a valid word with K, E, Y, E, D. Double E is okay.

But “CHEEK” uses more distinct consonants (C, H, K) compared to “KEYED” (K, Y, D), so it gives more info.

Let’s go with “CHEEK”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible.

One such word is ""RAISE"" - it contains R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters. This should give us good feedback on several high-frequency letters in the secret word.

We just learned that:
- R, A, I, S are NOT in the secret word (all marked x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (marked -).

So we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter E (but not in the 5th position, since that’s where it was last time).
2. Does NOT contain R, A, I, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants are T, N, L, C, D, G, M, H, etc.
A good candidate would use E plus some of these.  
“TEND” is 4 letters, so we need 5.  
“UNTIE” has I, which we already ruled out.  
“CHUTE” has U and T, but no E in a new spot.  
“UNTIE” is out (I).  
“MELON” has E in position 2, and uses M, L, O, N – none of which are ruled out yet.

Let’s try MELON.

We now know:
- Letters **not** in the word: R, A, I, S, M, L, O, N
- Letter **confirmed** in the word and in the **correct position**: E in position 2
- So the secret word is of the form: _ E _ _ _

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in the 2nd spot.
2. Uses only letters that have not been eliminated: {B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}
3. Still use common letters to maximize information.

Looking at common letters left: B, C, D, T, U, G, H, K, P.

Possible candidates:
- **CHEEK** – but has two E’s (we already used one E), and K is possible.
- **THEME** – but M is already eliminated.
- **BETEL** – but L is eliminated.
- **CETUS** – but S is eliminated.
- **DEBIT** – but I is eliminated.
- **HETEL** – L is eliminated.
- **KETTE** – T and K are still possible, but double E might be redundant.
- **TETON** – O and N are eliminated.
- **BETEL** – L is eliminated.
- **VETEL** – L is eliminated.
- **GUESS** – S is eliminated.
- **CUTIE** – I is eliminated.
- **BETON** – O and N are eliminated.
- **FETAL** – A and L are eliminated.
- **JETTY** – Y is possible, but double T might be okay.
- **PETER** – R is eliminated.
- **CETE** – too short.
- **DITED** – D and T are possible, but double E might be okay.

Actually, let's think more systematically. We need: _ E _ _ _ with remaining letters. Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Good options:
- **BETEL** – but L is out.
- **CETEL** – L is out.
- **DETEL** – L is out.
- **FETEL** – L is out.
- **GUESS** – S is out.
- **HEXEL** – X and L are possible, but L is out.
- **KEYES** – S is out.
- **PETER** – R is out.
- **TWEED** – W and D are possible, but double E might be okay.
- **YETTE** – Y and T are possible, but double E might be okay.

Among these, **TWEED** uses T, W, D, and E in position 2. All letters are still possible. This seems like a good guess.

Another option is **BETTE** (B, E, T, T, E), but T is common and B is possible.

But **TWEED** uses more distinct letters (T, W, E, D) which gives more information.

- C H E E K → valid word, uses C, H, K (all allowed), and double E (allowed since E is confirmed but not in 2,4,5, so must be in 3). This seems the best.

Consolidating all information so far:

1. Word structure: 5 letters.
2. Letter E is in the word, but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it was in positions 2,3,4,5 and always marked “-”, so it must be in position 1).
3. Letters definitely absent: R, A, I, S, M, L, O, N, T, W, C, H, K.
4. Remaining candidate letters (only consonants left, since vowels A, I, O are out and E is placed): B, D, F, G, J, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We know:
- E is in position 1 (only remaining spot).
- We still need 4 more letters from the allowed set.
- We want to maximize information by choosing letters that haven’t been used yet.

Good fresh letters to test: B, D, F, G, J, P, Q, U, V, Y, Z.

E B U Y D → not a word.
E B U D Y → not a word.

E G U Y D → not a word.
E P U Z Z → not a word.

A valid English word with E in position 1 and only fresh letters is “ELDER”, but L is already out.

Next best: “EJECT” – J, C, T are allowed? C and T are already out.

“EJECT” fails (C, T already eliminated).

“EVEN” is 4 letters.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible.

One such word is ""RAISE"" - it contains R, A, I, S, E which are all very common letters. This should give us good feedback on several high-frequency letters in the secret word.

We just learned that:
- R, A, I, S are NOT in the secret word (all marked x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (marked -).

So we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter E (but not in the 5th position, since that’s where it was last time).
2. Does NOT contain R, A, I, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants are T, N, L, C, D, G, M, H, etc.
A good candidate would use E plus some of these.  
“TEND” is 4 letters, so we need 5.  
“UNTIE” has I, which we already ruled out.  
“CHUTE” has U and T, but no E in a new spot.  
“UNTIE” is out (I).  
“MELON” has E in position 2, and uses M, L, O, N – none of which are ruled out yet.

Let’s try MELON.

We now know:
- Letters **not** in the word: R, A, I, S, M, L, O, N
- Letter **confirmed** in the word and in the **correct position**: E in position 2
- So the secret word is of the form: _ E _ _ _

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in the 2nd spot.
2. Uses only letters that have not been eliminated: {B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}
3. Still use common letters to maximize information.

Looking at common letters left: B, C, D, T, U, G, H, K, P.

Possible candidates:
- **CHEEK** – but has two E’s (we already used one E), and K is possible.
- **THEME** – but M is already eliminated.
- **BETEL** – but L is eliminated.
- **CETUS** – but S is eliminated.
- **DEBIT** – but I is eliminated.
- **HETEL** – L is eliminated.
- **KETTE** – T and K are still possible, but double E might be redundant.
- **TETON** – O and N are eliminated.
- **BETEL** – L is eliminated.
- **VETEL** – L is eliminated.
- **GUESS** – S is eliminated.
- **CUTIE** – I is eliminated.
- **BETON** – O and N are eliminated.
- **FETAL** – A and L are eliminated.
- **JETTY** – Y is possible, but double T might be okay.
- **PETER** – R is eliminated.
- **CETE** – too short.
- **DITED** – D and T are possible, but double E might be okay.

Actually, let's think more systematically. We need: _ E _ _ _ with remaining letters. Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Good options:
- **BETEL** – but L is out.
- **CETEL** – L is out.
- **DETEL** – L is out.
- **FETEL** – L is out.
- **GUESS** – S is out.
- **HEXEL** – X and L are possible, but L is out.
- **KEYES** – S is out.
- **PETER** – R is out.
- **TWEED** – W and D are possible, but double E might be okay.
- **YETTE** – Y and T are possible, but double E might be okay.

Among these, **TWEED** uses T, W, D, and E in position 2. All letters are still possible. This seems like a good guess.

Another option is **BETTE** (B, E, T, T, E), but T is common and B is possible.

But **TWEED** uses more distinct letters (T, W, E, D) which gives more information.

Let's go with **TWEED**.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

1. The word is 5 letters.
2. The letter E is in the word, but it is **not** in positions 2, 4, or 5 (because it was in position 2 in MELON and TWEED and marked ✓ in MELON, but then marked - in TWEED, meaning it is somewhere else).
3. Letters **not** in the word at all: R, A, I, S, M, L, O, N, T, W.
4. Therefore, the word must be of the form: _ _ E _ _ (E in position 3) and must use only the remaining letters: {B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z}.
5. We need a word with E in position 3 and no other letters already eliminated.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

We need two distinct consonants for positions 1 and 2, and two distinct consonants for positions 4 and 5 (or one of them could be a duplicate, but we’ll aim for distinct letters to maximize info).

Let’s list some candidate words with E in position 3 and only allowed letters:

- B C E D ? → need 5th letter. “BCE” is 3 letters.
- C H E E ? → double E is fine, but we already know E is somewhere else.
- D E E ? → no, E is already in 3rd.
- F U E N D → “FUEND” is not a word.
- C H E E K → “CHEEK” has K and double E. K is allowed, double E is allowed since we know E is somewhere else. But we need to check if any letters are eliminated. C, H, K are allowed. So “CHEEK” is possible.
- B U E R N → “BURN” is 4 letters, “BUREN” is not common.
- P U E R T → “PUERT” is not a word.
- G U E R N → “GUE RN” is not 5 letters.
- H U E R D → not a word.
- F U E R D → not a word.
- D U E R N → not a word.
- C H E E K → valid word, uses C, H, K (all allowed), and double E (allowed since E is confirmed but not in 2,4,5, so must be in 3). This seems the best.

Another candidate: “BEEPS” but P is allowed and S is eliminated. So no.
Another: “KEYED” – Y and D are allowed, K is allowed. “KEYED” is a valid word with K, E, Y, E, D. Double E is okay.

But “CHEEK” uses more distinct consonants (C, H, K) compared to “KEYED” (K, Y, D), so it gives more info.

Let’s go with “CHEEK”.

Let's summarize everything we now know:

1. Word length: 5 letters.
2. The letter E is in the word, but it is NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it has been tried in every position and always got “-”). This is impossible unless we’ve made a mistake. Rechecking the feedback:
   - Guess 1: RAISE → E(-) — so E exists but not in position 5.
   - Guess 2: MELON → E(✓) — so E is in position 2 and correct.
   - Guess 3: TWEED → E(-) — E is not in positions 3 or 4.
   - Guess 4: CHEEK → E(-) — E is not in positions 3 or 5.
   - Guess 5: EXUDE → E(-) — E is not in position 1.

   So E must be in position 2 (from MELON) and also not in positions 1,3,4,5. This is consistent. Therefore the word is of the form: _ E _ _ _.
3. Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, A, I, S, M, L, O, N, T, W, C, H, K, X.
4. Remaining candidate letters (consonants only, since A, I, O are out and E is placed): B, D, F, G, J, P, Q, U, V, Y, Z.

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5 with four distinct letters from the remaining set. To maximize information, we should pick four new letters that haven't been used yet. A good choice is B, D, F, G.

Possible words: we need a 5-letter English word matching _ E _ _ _ with letters from B, D, F, G plus the already-placed E.

Looking at common letters, G is often at the end, so let's try a word ending in G: _ E _ _ G. A good candidate is ""BEFGG"" – but that's not a word.

Another approach: list all valid English words with E in position 2 and only allowed letters. The allowed letters are B, D, F, G, J, P, Q, U, V, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- B E G E D → ""BEGED"" is not a word.
- F E G E D → ""FEGED"" is not a word.
- P E G E D → ""PEGED"" is not a word.
- J E G E D → ""JEGED"" is not a word.
- V E G E D → ""VEGED"" is not a word.
- D E F E D → ""DEDEF"" is not a word.
- B E F E D → ""BEFED"" is not a word.
- G E M E D → M is out.
- P E D E D → ""PEDED"" is not a word.
- V E D E D → ""VEDED"" is not a word.
- B E D E D → ""BEDED"" is not a word.
- G E B E D → ""GEBED"" is not a word.
- F E B E D → ""FEBED"" is not a word.
- J E B E D → ""JEBED"" is not a word.
- B E G E D → already checked.
- F E B E D → already checked.
- G E F E D → ""GEFED"" is not a word.
- P E G E D → already checked.
- V E G E D → already checked.
- B E V E D → ""BEVED"" is not a word.
- D E V E D → ""DEVED"" is not a word.
- F E V E D → ""FEVED"" is not a word.
- G E V E D → ""GEVED"" is not a word.
- J E V E D → ""JEVED"" is not a word.
- P E V E D → ""PEVED"" is not a word.
- Q E V E D → ""QEVED"" is not a word.
- U E V E D → ""UEVED"" is not a word.
- Y E V E D → ""YEVED"" is not a word.
- Z E V E D → ""ZEVED"" is not a word.

Hmm, none of these are valid. Let's try a different pattern: _ E _ _ _ with letters from B, D, F, G, J, P, Q, U, V, Y, Z.

Another candidate: ""FEDUG"" – not a word.

Wait, let's think of actual words:
- ""BEGUM"" – M is out.
- ""DEAFY"" – A is out.
- ""JUMPE"" – P, E, but J and U are allowed, but M is out.
- ""BUMPY"" – M is out.
- ""FUBED"" – not a word.
- ""GUESS"" – S is out.
- ""JUICE"" – I, C are out.
- ""PEONY"" – O, N are out.
- ""BEGUM"" – M is out.
- ""DEWED"" – W is out.
- ""FEDGE"" – G, D, E, but E is already in position 2, so F E D G E – but that would be E in position 5, which is out.
- ""JEDGE"" – J, D, G, E – E in position 4 is out.
- ""PEUGE"" – P, E, U, G, E – E in position 4 is out.
- ""VEGUE"" – V, E, G, U, E – E in position 4 is out.
- ""YEGGE"" – Y, E, G, G, E – E in positions 1 and 5 are out.
- ""ZEBUD"" – Z, E, B, U, D – but E is in position 2, so Z E B U D – that's a valid word!

""ZEBUD"" is a valid 5-letter word (a young bull/ox). It uses:
- Z (allowed)
- E in position 2 (correct)
- B (allowed)
- U (allowed)
- D (allowed)

This seems to be the only valid word fitting all constraints.
