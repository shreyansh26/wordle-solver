For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. 

Some good starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly strong because it contains very common consonants (C, R, N) and two very common vowels (A, E). The letters C, R, and N are among the most frequent in English, and A and E are the two most common vowels. This gives me a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word and gathering useful feedback.

Therefore, I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: correct position (✓) – so A is the 3rd letter
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- Pattern: _ _ A _ _
- R is somewhere in the word, but not in position 2.
- Letters to avoid: C, N, E.

We need a word with A in the 3rd position and R somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 – but 3 is already A). We also want to test new common letters.

Good letters to try next: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

Let me pick a word that fits:
- A in 3rd position
- Contains R (not in 2nd position)
- Uses new common letters

Possible candidates:
- TRAMP (but has P which is less common)
- GRASP (but has G which is less common)
- BRISK (but B is less common)
- DRABS (but D and B are less common)
- SLASH (but S and H are less common)
- FRANK (but N is already ruled out)
- GRAND (but N is ruled out)
- TRAIL (but I is less common)
- CRAMP – C is ruled out
- PRADA – P, D are okay, but A is already known, but this has two A's which is possible
- TRAMP – already considered

Actually, let's think differently: we know A is in 3rd, R is somewhere else. Let's try to test S, T, L, etc.

A good choice would be ""TRASH"":
- T, R, A, S, H
- A is 3rd – good
- R is 2nd – but feedback said R is in wrong position (not 2nd), so this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""DRATS"":
- D, R, A, T, S
- A is 3rd – good
- R is 2nd – again, same issue.

Next: ""GRASP"":
- G, R, A, S, P
- A is 3rd – good
- R is 2nd – again, same issue.

Next: ""BLART"":
- B, L, A, R, T
- A is 3rd – good
- R is 4th – this is acceptable (not 2nd)
- Uses new letters B, L, T

This seems good. Alternatively ""PLART"" but P is less common.

Another option: ""SHARD"":
- S, H, A, R, D
- A is 3rd – good
- R is 4th – acceptable
- Uses S, H, D

Between these, ""SHARD"" uses very common letters (S, H, D) and places R in 4th position, which is allowed. This seems optimal.

So I'll go with ""SHARD"".

From the two guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
   - A is fixed in position 3.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - Letters NOT in the word: C, N, E.

2. SHARD → S(-) H(x) A(✓) R(-) D(x)
   - A is still in position 3.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (it’s somewhere else).
   - H and D are NOT in the word.

So we now know:
- Pattern: _ _ A _ _
- R is in the word, possible positions: 1, 3, 5 (but 3 is A), so 1 or 5.
- S is in the word, possible positions: 2, 3, 4, 5 (but 3 is A), so 2, 4, or 5.
- Letters to avoid: C, N, E, H, D.

We need a word that:
- Has A in position 3.
- Contains R (in 1 or 5).
- Contains S (in 2, 4, or 5).
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s list possible letter sets:
- Position 1: could be R (since R could be in 1) or another allowed letter.
- Position 2: could be S (if S is in 2) or another allowed letter.
- Position 3: A (fixed).
- Position 4: could be S (if S is in 4) or another allowed letter.
- Position 5: could be R (since R could be in 5) or S (if S is in 5), but R and S can’t both be here.

Allowed letters (excluding C, N, E, H, D): basically the rest of the alphabet minus those five.

Let’s try to construct a valid word:
- If R is in position 1: R _ A _ _
  - Then S must be in 2 or 4.
  - Possible: R S A _ _ or R _ A S _
  - Remaining letters must be from allowed set.

- If R is in position 5: _ _ A _ R
  - Then S must be in 2 or 4.
  - Possible: _ S A _ R or _ _ A S R

Let’s look for common 5-letter words fitting these patterns.

Option 1: R S A _ _
  - RSA?? – common words: RSA is a prefix but not sure about 5-letter. RSAID? Not a word. RASPY? But P is allowed. RASPY – but Y is allowed. Let’s check: R A S P Y – but A is 3rd, so pattern is _ _ A _ _. So R would have to be 1st, A 3rd, S 2nd, P 4th, Y 5th: R S A P Y – but does this fit? Pattern is 1-2-3-4-5: R(1), S(2), A(3), P(4), Y(5). This seems valid. Letters used: R, S, A, P, Y – all allowed.

Option 2: R _ A S _
  - R _ A S _ – possible: R O A S S? O is allowed, but double S might be unlikely. Not sure.

Option 3: _ S A _ R
  - _ S A _ R – possible letters for 1 and 4: from allowed set. Common word: P S A C R? No, C is out. B S A L R? No. M S A N R? N is out. T S A L R? T is allowed, L is allowed: T S A L R – but is this a word? T is 1st, S 2nd, A 3rd, L 4th, R 5th: T S A L R – seems like a valid pattern, but is ""tsalr"" a word? Probably not.

Option 4: _ _ A S R
  - _ _ A S R – possible: B A S S R? No, B is allowed, but double S might be a stretch. M A S S R? No. P A S S R? No. T A S S R? No. Not common.

Option 5: _ S A R _ – but R would be 4th, which conflicts with R needing to be 1 or 5.

So the most promising seems R S A P Y (RSAPY) but is this a valid word? Actually, ""RSAPY"" isn’t a standard English word. Let me reconsider.

Wait, in English words, ""RASPY"" is an informal word meaning ""raspy"" (like a rasp sound), but it’s not standard. ""RASPY"" is 5 letters, but might not be in most word lists.

Alternative: R A S P Y – but A is 3rd, so R(1) A(2) S(3) P(4) Y(5) – but A must be 3rd, so this is invalid.

I think I messed up the positioning. Let me re-express:

We need _ _ A _ _ with R and S somewhere.

Possibilities:
- R in 1: R _ A _ _
  - S must be 2 or 4.
  - R _ A S _ : R ? A S _ – e.g., R O A S _ – but what? ROAST? But T is allowed. R O A S T – is this valid? R(1) O(2) A(3) S(4) T(5). Letters used: R, O, A, S, T – all allowed. ROAST is a valid English word meaning ""to roast"".

Check constraints:
- A is 3rd – yes (A).
- R is in 1 – allowed (not 2,4, so 1 is fine).
- S is in 4 – allowed (not 2 or 4? Wait, S is allowed in 2,4,5. So 4 is fine.
- Letters used: R, O, A, S, T – none are forbidden.

This seems optimal.

Another candidate: R S A L T – but A is 3rd, so R(1) S(2) A(3) L(4) T(5). R S A L T – ""rsalt"" isn’t a word.

Thus, ROAST seems the best.

So the next guess is ROAST.
</think>

<guess>ROAST</guess>",ROAST,"From the two guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
   - A is fixed in position 3.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - Letters NOT in the word: C, N, E.

2. SHARD → S(-) H(x) A(✓) R(-) D(x)
   - A is still in position 3.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (it’s somewhere else).
   - H and D are NOT in the word.

So we now know:
- Pattern: _ _ A _ _
- R is in the word, possible positions: 1, 3, 5 (but 3 is A), so 1 or 5.
- S is in the word, possible positions: 2, 3, 4, 5 (but 3 is A), so 2, 4, or 5.
- Letters to avoid: C, N, E, H, D.

We need a word that:
- Has A in position 3.
- Contains R (in 1 or 5).
- Contains S (in 2, 4, or 5).
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s list possible letter sets:
- Position 1: could be R (since R could be in 1) or another allowed letter.
- Position 2: could be S (if S is in 2) or another allowed letter.
- Position 3: A (fixed).
- Position 4: could be S (if S is in 4) or another allowed letter.
- Position 5: could be R (since R could be in 5) or S (if S is in 5), but R and S can’t both be here.

Allowed letters (excluding C, N, E, H, D): basically the rest of the alphabet minus those five.

Let’s try to construct a valid word:
- If R is in position 1: R _ A _ _
  - Then S must be in 2 or 4.
  - Possible: R S A _ _ or R _ A S _
  - Remaining letters must be from allowed set.

- If R is in position 5: _ _ A _ R
  - Then S must be in 2 or 4.
  - Possible: _ S A _ R or _ _ A S R

Let’s look for common 5-letter words fitting these patterns.

Option 1: R S A _ _
  - RSA?? – common words: RSA is a prefix but not sure about 5-letter. RSAID? Not a word. RASPY? But P is allowed. RASPY – but Y is allowed. Let’s check: R A S P Y – but A is 3rd, so pattern is _ _ A _ _. So R would have to be 1st, A 3rd, S 2nd, P 4th, Y 5th: R S A P Y – but does this fit? Pattern is 1-2-3-4-5: R(1), S(2), A(3), P(4), Y(5). This seems valid. Letters used: R, S, A, P, Y – all allowed.

Option 2: R _ A S _
  - R _ A S _ – possible: R O A S S? O is allowed, but double S might be unlikely. Not sure.

Option 3: _ S A _ R
  - _ S A _ R – possible letters for 1 and 4: from allowed set. Common word: P S A C R? No, C is out. B S A L R? No. M S A N R? N is out. T S A L R? T is allowed, L is allowed: T S A L R – but is this a word? T is 1st, S 2nd, A 3rd, L 4th, R 5th: T S A L R – seems like a valid pattern, but is ""tsalr"" a word? Probably not.

Option 4: _ _ A S R
  - _ _ A S R – possible: B A S S R? No, B is allowed, but double S might be a stretch. M A S S R? No. P A S S R? No. T A S S R? No. Not common.

Option 5: _ S A R _ – but R would be 4th, which conflicts with R needing to be 1 or 5.

So the most promising seems R S A P Y (RSAPY) but is this a valid word? Actually, ""RSAPY"" isn’t a standard English word. Let me reconsider.

Wait, in English words, ""RASPY"" is an informal word meaning ""raspy"" (like a rasp sound), but it’s not standard. ""RASPY"" is 5 letters, but might not be in most word lists.

Alternative: R A S P Y – but A is 3rd, so R(1) A(2) S(3) P(4) Y(5) – but A must be 3rd, so this is invalid.

I think I messed up the positioning. Let me re-express:

We need _ _ A _ _ with R and S somewhere.

Possibilities:
- R in 1: R _ A _ _
  - S must be 2 or 4.
  - R _ A S _ : R ? A S _ – e.g., R O A S _ – but what? ROAST? But T is allowed. R O A S T – is this valid? R(1) O(2) A(3) S(4) T(5). Letters used: R, O, A, S, T – all allowed. ROAST is a valid English word meaning ""to roast"".

Check constraints:
- A is 3rd – yes (A).
- R is in 1 – allowed (not 2,4, so 1 is fine).
- S is in 4 – allowed (not 2 or 4? Wait, S is allowed in 2,4,5. So 4 is fine.
- Letters used: R, O, A, S, T – none are forbidden.

This seems optimal.

Another candidate: R S A L T – but A is 3rd, so R(1) S(2) A(3) L(4) T(5). R S A L T – ""rsalt"" isn’t a word.

Thus, ROAST seems the best.

So the next guess is ROAST.",Guess 3: ROAST -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
