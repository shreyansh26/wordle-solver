### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good opening word typically includes common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A strong opening word would use several of these. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us information about 5 different letters, many of which are among the most frequent in English, maximizing the chances of getting useful feedback (either positions or letters in the word).

We just learned that none of the letters A, R, O, S, E are in the secret word at all.  
That’s extremely useful information: it eliminates a huge chunk of the English lexicon.  
With those five letters out, we need a new set of common letters to probe.  
The next most frequent letters in English are I, N, T, L, U, D, C, M, P, F, K, B, G, H, Y, V, W, Z, X, Q, J.

Let’s pick a word that uses some of the top remaining letters and still gives us five distinct letters.  
A good candidate is “UNTIL”: it contains U, N, T, I, L — all high-frequency letters not yet ruled out.  
This should provide fresh information about five new letters and help narrow the possibilities significantly.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good opening word typically includes common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A strong opening word would use several of these. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us information about 5 different letters, many of which are among the most frequent in English, maximizing the chances of getting useful feedback (either positions or letters in the word).

We just learned that none of the letters A, R, O, S, E are in the secret word at all.  
That’s extremely useful information: it eliminates a huge chunk of the English lexicon.  
With those five letters out, we need a new set of common letters to probe.  
The next most frequent letters in English are I, N, T, L, U, D, C, M, P, F, K, B, G, H, Y, V, W, Z, X, Q, J.

Let’s pick a word that uses some of the top remaining letters and still gives us five distinct letters.  
A good candidate is “UNTIL”: it contains U, N, T, I, L — all high-frequency letters not yet ruled out.  
This should provide fresh information about five new letters and help narrow the possibilities significantly.

- Letter in the word but in the wrong position: L somewhere else (not at position 5)

So the pattern is: _ _ _ I _

We still need to test common letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
Remaining high-frequency letters include D, C, M, P, F, K, B, G, H, Y, V, W, Z, X, Q, J.

We want a word that:
1. Has I in the 4th position.
2. Uses other high-frequency letters that haven’t been eliminated.
3. Places L somewhere other than position 5 (since L is in the word but not there).

A good candidate is “FILCH”:
- F, C, H haven’t been tested yet.
- L is in position 2 (not 5), satisfying the feedback.
- I is in position 4 as required.

This should tell us about F, C, H, and confirm where L belongs.
