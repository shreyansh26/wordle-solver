For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One of the classic and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it includes A, R, O, S, and E - five of the most common letters. This gives us a high chance of identifying which of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" with S, L, A, T, E - also covering five common letters. Between these, ""AROSE"" is slightly better due to the inclusion of O, which is very common.

After evaluating options, ""AROSE"" seems to be the optimal first guess to maximize the information we can gain about the secret word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One of the classic and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it includes A, R, O, S, and E - five of the most common letters. This gives us a high chance of identifying which of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" with S, L, A, T, E - also covering five common letters. Between these, ""AROSE"" is slightly better due to the inclusion of O, which is very common.

After evaluating options, ""AROSE"" seems to be the optimal first guess to maximize the information we can gain about the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be in position 1).
- R, O, S are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (can’t be in position 5).

So we need a word that:
1. Contains A and E (but not in positions 1 or 5 respectively).
2. Does not contain R, O, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Looking at remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, H, G, B, M, P, F, K, W, Y, V, Z, X, Q, J.

I’ll try to include as many of these as possible while forming a valid 5-letter word. A good candidate is “UNTIE”:
- U, N, T, I are all new common letters.
- Places A and E in new positions (3 and 4, not 1 or 5).
- Doesn’t use any of the excluded letters R, O, S.

Other possibilities like “UNTIE”, “UNTIE”, “UNTIE” are the same, so I’ll go with that.

Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, U, N, T, I
- Letters that ARE in the word, but whose exact positions are still unknown: A, E

We have two letters (A and E) that must appear somewhere in the final word, and we know they cannot be in the positions tried so far:
- A cannot be in position 1 (from AROSE) and also not in position 3 (from UNTIE), so A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) and also not in position 4 (from UNTIE), so E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tested yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want a word that:
1. Contains both A and E.
2. Places A and E in allowable positions.
3. Uses other untested common letters to maximize information.

Let’s try to place E in position 1 and A in position 2, and fill the remaining three spots with new common letters. A good candidate is “EACHY”:
- E in position 1 (allowed).
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- C, H, Y are new letters we haven’t tested yet.

Another possible word is “EAVY” but that’s 4 letters, so we need 5. “EACHY” seems perfect.

Let me double-check:
- Letters used: E, A, C, H, Y
- None of R, O, S, U, N, T, I are used.
- Positions:
  - A is in position 2 (allowed, since it can’t be 1 or 3).
  - E is in position 1 (allowed, since it can’t be 4 or 5).

This seems like the best next guess.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters ruled OUT (never appear in the secret word):
R, O, S, U, N, T, I, H, K

Letters that ARE in the word and their current status:
- C: tried in position 3 (Guess 3) and got “-” (wrong position), so C is somewhere else (not position 3).
- E: tried in positions 5 (Guess 1), 4 (Guess 2), 1 (Guess 3), 4 (Guess 4) and always got “-” (wrong position), so E can only be in position 2 now.
- A: tried in positions 1 (Guess 1), 3 (Guess 2), 1 (Guess 3), 1 (Guess 4) and always got “-” (wrong position), so A can only be in position 4 now.
- Y: tried in position 5 (Guess 3) and got “✓”, so Y is fixed in position 5.

So the pattern so far is:
_ _ C _ Y   (but C is not in position 3, so scratch that)

Actually, let’s re-express the pattern with the correct positional info:
- Position 5: Y (fixed)
- Position 2: E (only remaining spot)
- Position 4: A (only remaining spot)
- C must be in either position 1 or position 2 or position 4, but:
  – position 2 is E
  – position 4 is A
  – so C must be in position 1.

Thus the pattern is:
C E _ A Y

We now need a letter for position 3 that has never been ruled out and forms a valid 5-letter word.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
B, D, F, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a letter for position 3 such that “C E _ A Y” is a valid word.

Scanning the dictionary, the only common word that fits is:
C E L A Y → “CELAY” is not a word.
C E B A Y → “CEBAY” is not a word.
C E D A Y → “CEDAY” is not a word.
C E F A Y → “CEFAY” is not a word.
C E L A Y → non-word.
C E M A Y → “CEMAY” is not a word.
C E P A Y → “CEPAY” is not a word.
C E L A Y → non-word.

Wait, let’s step back: the pattern is C E _ A Y, and we need a single letter for position 3.

The only real word that matches is:
C E L A Y → “CELAY” – but that’s not valid.

Actually, the correct word is:
C E L A Y → “CELAY” does not exist.

Let’s try the letter “L” in position 3: “CELAY” – invalid.

Try “D”: “CEDAY” – invalid.

Try “B”: “CEBAY” – invalid.

Try “M”: “CEMAY” – invalid.

Try “P”: “CEPAY” – invalid.

Try “G”: “CEGAY” – invalid.

Try “V”: “CEVAY” – invalid.

Try “J”: “CEJAY” – invalid.

Try “Q”: “CEQAY” – invalid.

Try “X”: “CEXAY” – invalid.

Try “Z”: “CEZAY” – invalid.

Try “F”: “CEFAY” – invalid.

Try “W”: “CEWAY” – invalid.

Try “L” again – seems no valid word.

Wait, let’s double-check the pattern.

We have:
- Position 5: Y (✓ from Guess 3)
- Position 2: E (only spot left after multiple tries)
- Position 4: A (only spot left after multiple tries)
- C must be in position 1 (only remaining spot not taken by E, A, or Y)

So the word must be: C E _ A Y

The only valid English word that matches is:
C E L A Y → “CELAY” – but that’s not a word.

I must have missed a letter. Let’s re-scan the allowed letters for any that form a word with C E _ A Y.

The letter “L” gives no valid word.

Wait, the letter “D” gives “CEDAY” – invalid.

The letter “B” gives “CEBAY” – invalid.

The letter “M” gives “CEMAY” – invalid.

The letter “P” gives “CEPAY” – invalid.

The letter “G” gives “CEGAY” – invalid.

The letter “V” gives “CEVAY” – invalid.

The letter “J” gives “CEJAY” – invalid.

The letter “Q” gives “CEQAY” – invalid.

The letter “X” gives “CEXAY” – invalid.

The letter “Z” gives “CEZAY” – invalid.

The letter “F” gives “CEFAY” – invalid.

The letter “W” gives “CEWAY” – invalid.

This suggests I may have made an error in deducing positions.

Let me re-examine:

From Guess 4 (CAKEY → C(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) Y(✓)) we now know:
- Y is in position 5 (✓)
- C is in the word but NOT in position 1 (because we got “-” when we placed C in position 1)
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1 (because we got “-” when we placed A in position 1)
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (because we got “-” when we placed E in position 4)
- K is not in the word.

From earlier:
- Positions ruled out for A: 1, 3
- Positions ruled out for E: 5, 4
- Positions ruled out for C: 1, 3

So:
- C can be in position 2 or 4
- A can be in position 2, 4
- E can be in position 1, 2, 3

We also know the pattern is _ _ _ _ Y (position 5 = Y).

Let’s list possible positions:

Case 1: C in position 2
Then word looks like: _ C _ _ Y
A must be in position 4: _ C _ A Y
E must be in position 1 or 3: E C _ A Y or _ C E A Y

Check if these form valid words:
- E C _ A Y: need a letter for position 3. Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
  – E C B A Y → “ECBAY” – invalid
  – E C L A Y → “ECLAY” – invalid
  – E C D A Y → “ECDAY” – invalid
  – etc. No valid word.

- _ C E A Y: need a letter for position 1. Allowed letters same.
  – B C E A Y → “BCEAY” – invalid
  – L C E A Y → “LCEAY” – invalid
  – M C E A Y → “MCEAY” – invalid
  – No valid word.

Case 2: C in position 4
Then word looks like: _ _ _ C Y
A must be in position 2 or 3:
- If A in position 2: _ A _ C Y
  – E must be in position 1 or 3. Position 3 is open.
  – E A _ C Y: need letter for position 3. Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
    – E A B C Y → “EABCY” – invalid
    – E A L C Y → “EALCY” – invalid
    – E A M C Y → “EAMCY” – invalid
    – No valid word.

- If A in position 3: _ _ A C Y
  – E must be in position 1 or 2.
  – E _ A C Y: need letter for position 2. Allowed letters same.
    – E B A C Y → “EBACY” – invalid
    – E L A C Y → “ELACY” – invalid
    – E M A C Y → “EMACY” – invalid
    – No valid word.

  – _ E A C Y: need letter for position 1. Allowed letters same.
    – B E A C Y → “BEACY” – invalid
    – L E A C Y → “LEACY” – invalid
    – M E A C Y → “MEACY” – invalid
    – No valid word.

This is puzzling. Let me re-examine the feedback.

From Guess 3 (EACHY → E(-) A(-) C(✓) H(x) Y(✓)):
- C in position 3 was marked ✓, so C is in position 3.
- Y in position 5 was marked ✓, so Y is in position 5.
- E, A were in the word but wrong positions.

From Guess 4 (CAKEY → C(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) Y(✓)):
- C in position 1 was marked -, so C is not in position 1 (but from Guess 3 it is in position 3).
- A in position 1 was marked -, so A is not in position 1.
- E in position 4 was marked -, so E is not in position 4.
- Y in position 5 is ✓, confirming Y is in position 5.

Thus the pattern is:
_ _ C _ Y
with:
- A must be in position 2 or 4 (cannot be 1 or 3)
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (cannot be 4 or 5)
- C is fixed in position 3.
- Y is fixed in position 5.

So possible positions:
- If A is in position 2: _ A C _ Y
  – E must be in position 1 or 3. Position 3 is C, so E must be in position 1.
  – Thus word: E A C _ Y. Need a letter for position 4. Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
    – E A C B Y → “EACBY” – invalid
    – E A C L Y → “EACLY” – invalid
    – E A C M Y → “EACMY” – invalid
    – E A C D Y → “EACDY” – invalid
    – E A C F Y → “EACFY” – invalid
    – E A C G Y → “EACGY” – invalid
    – E A C J Y → “EACJY” – invalid
    – E A C Q Y → “EACQY” – invalid
    – E A C V Y → “EACVY” – invalid
    – E A C W Y → “EACWY” – invalid
    – E A C X Y → “EACXY” – invalid
    – E A C Z Y → “EACZY” – invalid
    – No valid word.

- If A is in position 4: _ _ C A Y
  – E must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (cannot be 4 or 5)
  – C is in position 3, so E can be 1, 2, or 3 (but 3 is C), so E must be 1 or 2.
  – Case 1: E in position 1: E _ C A Y. Need letter for position 2. Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
    – E B C A Y → “EBCA Y” – invalid
    – E L C A Y → “ELCA Y” – invalid
    – E M C A Y → “EMCA Y” – invalid
    – E D C A Y → “EDCA Y” – invalid
    – E F C A Y → “EFCA Y” – invalid
    – E G C A Y → “EGCA Y” – invalid
    – E J C A Y → “EJCA Y” – invalid
    – E Q C A Y → “EQCA Y” – invalid
    – E V C A Y → “EVCA Y” – invalid
    – E W C A Y → “EWCA Y” – invalid
    – E X C A Y → “EXCA Y” – invalid
    – E Z C A Y → “EZCA Y” – invalid
    – No valid word.

  – Case 2: E in position 2: _ E C A Y. Need letter for position 1. Allowed letters same.
    – B E C A Y → “BECAY” – invalid
    – L E C A Y → “LECA Y” – invalid
    – M E C A Y → “MECA Y” – invalid
    – D E C A Y → “DECAY” – this is a valid word!

Let me verify “DECAY”:
- D, E, C, A, Y – none are ruled out.
- Positions:
  – Position 1: D (new letter, allowed)
  – Position 2: E (must be in word, allowed here)
  – Position 3: C (fixed, allowed)
  – Position 4: A (must be in word, allowed here)
  – Position 5: Y (fixed, allowed)
- All constraints satisfied.

Thus the next guess is “DECAY”.

So the pattern so far is:

- C must be in either position 1 or position 2 or position 4, but:
  – position 2 is E
  – position 4 is A
  – so C must be in position 1.

Thus the pattern is:
C E _ A Y

We now need a letter for position 3 that has never been ruled out and forms a valid 5-letter word.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
B, D, F, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a letter for position 3 such that “C E _ A Y” is a valid word.

Scanning the dictionary, the only common word that fits is:
C E L A Y → “CELAY” is not a word.
C E B A Y → “CEBAY” is not a word.
C E D A Y → “CEDAY” is not a word.

The only real word that matches is:
C E L A Y → “CELAY” – but that’s not valid.

Actually, the correct word is:

Let’s try the letter “L” in position 3: “CELAY” – invalid.

Try “F”: “CEFAY” – invalid.

Try “W”: “CEWAY” – invalid.

Try “L” again – seems no valid word.

Wait, let’s double-check the pattern.

We have:
- Position 5: Y (✓ from Guess 3)
- Position 2: E (only spot left after multiple tries)
- Position 4: A (only spot left after multiple tries)
- C must be in position 1 (only remaining spot not taken by E, A, or Y)

So the word must be: C E _ A Y

The only valid English word that matches is:
C E L A Y → “CELAY” – but that’s not a word.

I must have missed a letter. Let’s re-scan the allowed letters for any that form a word with C E _ A Y.

The letter “L” gives no valid word.

Wait, the letter “D” gives “CEDAY” – invalid.

The letter “B” gives “CEBAY” – invalid.

The letter “M” gives “CEMAY” – invalid.

The letter “P” gives “CEPAY” – invalid.

The letter “G” gives “CEGAY” – invalid.

The letter “Q” gives “CEQAY” – invalid.

The letter “X” gives “CEXAY” – invalid.

The letter “Z” gives “CEZAY” – invalid.

The letter “F” gives “CEFAY” – invalid.

The letter “W” gives “CEWAY” – invalid.

This suggests I may have made an error in deducing positions.

Let me re-examine:

From Guess 4 (CAKEY → C(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) Y(✓)) we now know:
- Y is in position 5 (✓)
- C is in the word but NOT in position 1 (because we got “-” when we placed C in position 1)
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1 (because we got “-” when we placed A in position 1)
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (because we got “-” when we placed E in position 4)
- K is not in the word.

From earlier:
- Positions ruled out for A: 1, 3
- Positions ruled out for E: 5, 4
- Positions ruled out for C: 1, 3

So:
- C can be in position 2 or 4
- A can be in position 2, 4
- E can be in position 1, 2, 3

We also know the pattern is _ _ _ _ Y (position 5 = Y).

Let’s list possible positions:

Case 1: C in position 2
Then word looks like: _ C _ _ Y
A must be in position 4: _ C _ A Y
E must be in position 1 or 3: E C _ A Y or _ C E A Y

Check if these form valid words:

  – B C E A Y → “BCEAY” – invalid
  – L C E A Y → “LCEAY” – invalid
  – M C E A Y → “MCEAY” – invalid
  – No valid word.

Case 2: C in position 4
Then word looks like: _ _ _ C Y
A must be in position 2 or 3:
- If A in position 2: _ A _ C Y
  – E must be in position 1 or 3. Position 3 is open.

This is puzzling. Let me re-examine the feedback.

From Guess 3 (EACHY → E(-) A(-) C(✓) H(x) Y(✓)):
- C in position 3 was marked ✓, so C is in position 3.
- Y in position 5 was marked ✓, so Y is in position 5.
- E, A were in the word but wrong positions.

From Guess 4 (CAKEY → C(-) A(-) K(x) E(-) Y(✓)):
- C in position 1 was marked -, so C is not in position 1 (but from Guess 3 it is in position 3).
- A in position 1 was marked -, so A is not in position 1.
- E in position 4 was marked -, so E is not in position 4.
- Y in position 5 is ✓, confirming Y is in position 5.

Thus the pattern is:
_ _ C _ Y
with:
- A must be in position 2 or 4 (cannot be 1 or 3)
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (cannot be 4 or 5)
- C is fixed in position 3.
- Y is fixed in position 5.

So possible positions:
- If A is in position 2: _ A C _ Y

- If A is in position 4: _ _ C A Y
  – E must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (cannot be 4 or 5)
  – C is in position 3, so E can be 1, 2, or 3 (but 3 is C), so E must be 1 or 2.
  – Case 1: E in position 1: E _ C A Y. Need letter for position 2. Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, J, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

    – L E C A Y → “LECA Y” – invalid
    – M E C A Y → “MECA Y” – invalid
    – D E C A Y → “DECAY” – this is a valid word!

Let me verify “DECAY”:
- D, E, C, A, Y – none are ruled out.
- Positions:
  – Position 1: D (new letter, allowed)
  – Position 2: E (must be in word, allowed here)
  – Position 3: C (fixed, allowed)
  – Position 4: A (must be in word, allowed here)

Thus the next guess is “DECAY”.",Guess 5: DECAY -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) E(✓) C(✓) A(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
