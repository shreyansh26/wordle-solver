For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it contains common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""CRANE"" which covers common letters including the vowels A and E, and the consonants C, R, N. 

Between these, I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has slightly better letter frequency coverage according to Wordle analysis, giving me a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word.

From the two previous guesses we know:

Letters ruled out entirely: C, A, N, E, B, L  
Letters that are in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: R, O, I  

So every letter in the new guess must be chosen only from {R, O, I} plus any other letters not yet tested (D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
We also know R cannot be in position 2, O cannot be in position 3, and I cannot be in position 4.

To maximize information we want a word that:
1. Uses as many of the known letters (R, O, I) as possible in different positions.
2. Introduces new, common letters.

A good candidate is “FRONT”:
- F is a common untested consonant.
- R, O, N, T use known or new letters, and none of the known constraints are violated:
  – R is not in position 2 (here it’s in 2, but we already know R is in the word somewhere; however, the feedback for CRANE said R is in the word but not in position 2, so R cannot be in position 2 anyway).  
  – O is not in position 3 (here it’s in 2, so that’s fine).  
  – I is not in position 4 (we aren’t using I here).

Actually, let’s pick “SPORT” instead:
- S, P, T are new common consonants.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- R is in position 5 (allowed).
This uses all three known letters (R, O) and introduces three new ones (S, P, T).

From all feedback so far:

Letters ruled out: C, A, N, E, B, L, S, P, T  
Letters confirmed in the word: R, O, I  

Positions ruled out:
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 5 (from CRANE and SPORT feedback)
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from BROIL and SPORT feedback)
- I cannot be in position 4 (from BROIL feedback)

So valid positions:
R: 1, 3, 4  
O: 1, 4, 5  
I: 1, 2, 3, 5  

Remaining unused common letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R, O, I exactly once each.
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
3. Respects the position rules above.

Candidate words:
- ORDIN – uses O, R, D, I, N (N ruled out)
- FROKI – uses F, R, O, K, I (K unused, positions: F1, R2 (invalid), O3 (invalid))

- DROIK – D, R, O, I, K (positions: D1, R2 (invalid), O3 (invalid), I4 (invalid), K5)

Let’s pick a valid one:
- ""DROIK"" is invalid because R, O, I would be in positions 2,3,4 which are ruled out.
- ""KROID"" – K, R, O, I, D – positions: K1, R2 (invalid), O3 (invalid), I4 (invalid), D5

Another candidate: ""FRUIT"" – F, R, U, I, T (T ruled out)
- ""GRIOT"" – G, R, I, O, T (T ruled out)

Let’s find a word that places R, O, I in allowed positions and fills the rest with new letters.

Valid placement:
R: 1, 3, 4  
O: 1, 4, 5  
I: 1, 2, 3, 5  

Let’s try R in 1, O in 5, I in 2:
Word pattern: _ I _ _ R (but O needs to be in 5, so _ I _ O R)
We need a letter for position 3 and 4 from remaining unused: D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible word: ""DINGO"" – D, I, N, G, O (N ruled out)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it contains common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""CRANE"" which covers common letters including the vowels A and E, and the consonants C, R, N. 

Between these, I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has slightly better letter frequency coverage according to Wordle analysis, giving me a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(x), N(x), E(x) → A, N, E are not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters to keep: R (somewhere other than position 2)
- Letters to avoid: C, A, N, E
- Still possible vowels: I, O, U
- Still possible consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

I want a new word that:
1. Contains R (not in position 2)
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out
3. Uses fresh vowels if possible
4. Uses common remaining consonants to maximize info

Good candidates:
- DRINK (D, R, I, N, K) – but N is already ruled out.
- SPOIL (S, P, O, I, L) – no R.
- TRIO (T, R, I, O) – but is 4 letters.
- BROIL (B, R, O, I, L) – all letters fresh, R not in position 2.

""BROIL"" seems ideal: it has R (not in position 2), uses B, O, I, L (all fresh), and avoids every eliminated letter.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: BROIL -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(-) O(-) I(-) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we know:

Letters ruled out entirely: C, A, N, E, B, L  
Letters that are in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: R, O, I  

So every letter in the new guess must be chosen only from {R, O, I} plus any other letters not yet tested (D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
We also know R cannot be in position 2, O cannot be in position 3, and I cannot be in position 4.

To maximize information we want a word that:
1. Uses as many of the known letters (R, O, I) as possible in different positions.
2. Introduces new, common letters.

A good candidate is “FRONT”:
- F is a common untested consonant.
- R, O, N, T use known or new letters, and none of the known constraints are violated:
  – R is not in position 2 (here it’s in 2, but we already know R is in the word somewhere; however, the feedback for CRANE said R is in the word but not in position 2, so R cannot be in position 2 anyway).  
  – O is not in position 3 (here it’s in 2, so that’s fine).  
  – I is not in position 4 (we aren’t using I here).

Actually, let’s pick “SPORT” instead:
- S, P, T are new common consonants.
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- R is in position 5 (allowed).
This uses all three known letters (R, O) and introduces three new ones (S, P, T).

From Guess 4 (VIRGO) we now know:

- V is in position 1 and is correct (✓).
- I is in position 2 and is correct (✓).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
- G is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

So far we have:

Letters confirmed:
- V (position 1)
- I (position 2)
- R (somewhere, but not position 3)
- G (somewhere, but not position 4)
- O (somewhere, but not position 5)

Letters ruled out:
C, A, N, E, B, L, S, P, T, plus any already handled.

Remaining unused common letters: D, F, H, J, K, M, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Positions so far:
1: V
2: I
3: not R, and must be one of the remaining letters
4: not G, and must be one of the remaining letters
5: not O, and must be one of the remaining letters

We also know:
- R must be in position 4 or 5 (since it can't be in 1, 2, or 3)
- O must be in position 3 or 4 (since it can't be in 1, 2, or 5)
- G must be in position 3 or 5 (since it can't be in 1, 2, or 4)

Let's consider possible placements:

Case 1: R in position 4
Then:
- Position 4: R
- O must be in position 3 (since it can't be in 5)
- G must be in position 5 (since it can't be in 4)
So the word would be: V I O R G

Case 2: R in position 5
Then:
- Position 5: R
- O must be in position 3 or 4
- G must be in position 3 or 5 (but 5 is R), so G must be in position 3
- Then O must be in position 4
So the word would be: V I G O R

Both VIORG and VIGOR are valid English words. Let's check:
- VIORG: not a common word, probably not valid.
- VIGOR: valid and common.

Therefore, the most reasonable next guess is VIGOR.
