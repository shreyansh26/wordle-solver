For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. Among these, words that contain multiple vowels or common consonants are good choices.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum coverage of high-frequency letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Another good alternative would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and E which are very common.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains A somewhere, but not in position 1.
3. It does not contain R, O, S.

Good letters to try next (common ones not yet ruled out): T, N, L, C, D, U, I, Y, etc.

A useful next guess would be one that:
- Keeps E in position 5.
- Uses A in a different position (not 1).
- Avoids R, O, S.
- Introduces several new common consonants.

""UNTIE"" is a candidate, but it has I and U which are less common. ""ADIEU"" is too long. ""TALKE"" uses T, A, L, K, E — all valid letters and positions. But ""TALKE"" is not a common word.

""ADIEU"" is 5 letters, ends with E, has A not in position 1, and avoids R, O, S. But it's less common.

""PAINT"" is another candidate, but it doesn't end with E.

""FAINT"" — no E.

""VAINT"" — not a word.

""HAIRY"" — no E.

""WHITE"" — ends with E, has A in position 2, uses W, H, I, T. This seems good.

""WHITE"":
- W: new letter
- H: new letter
- I: new letter
- T: new letter
- E: correct in position 5
- A is not present, but we know A is in the word somewhere, so this might be risky.

""CHAIR"" — no E.

""CLEAN"" — no E.

""PLAIN"" — no E.

""GRAIN"" — no E.

""TWINE"" — ends with E, has A? No A. So not useful.

""ADIEU"" — has A, ends with E, avoids R, O, S. But less common.

""ADIEU"" seems the best among less common words, but ""UNTIE"" is more common. However, ""UNTIE"" has I and U which are less common vowels.

""ADIEU"" is more common. Let's go with ""ADIEU"".

But wait, ""ADIEU"" is a common word (as in ""adieu"" meaning goodbye). It uses A, D, I, E, U. Ends with E, has A not in position 1 (it's in position 1, but the feedback said A is in wrong position, so position 1 is wrong, meaning A must be in positions 2-4). So ""ADIEU"" has A in position 1, which is wrong. So this is invalid.

Back to drawing board.

We need a word ending with E, containing A not in position 1, and avoiding R, O, S.

Good candidates:
- ""TALKE"" — but K is less common.
- ""PAINT"" — no E.
- ""WHITE"" — ends with E, A is not present, so we can't test A.
- ""VAINT"" — no E.
- ""PLAIN"" — no E.
- ""FACET"" — ends with T.
- ""FACTS"" — no E.

""ELATE"" — ends with E, has A in position 2, uses E, L, A, T. This seems good.
- E is in position 1 (but we know E is in position 5, so this would be wrong for E).
Wait, no — ""ELATE"" ends with E, so E is in position 5, and A is in position 3. This would be ideal.

""ELATE"":
- E in position 5 (known correct)
- A in position 3 (testing new position for A)
- L, T are new letters
- Avoids R, O, S

This seems optimal.

   - First E is marked (-) because it’s in the word but in the wrong position.  But we already know E is in position 5 and that’s correct, so this just re-affirms E is only in position 5.

So the confirmed pattern is: _ L A _ E

Letters still unknown: positions 1 and 4.

Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, T.

Common letters not yet used: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need:
- Position 1: any letter except E, A, L (and the ruled out ones)
- Position 4: any letter except E, A, L (and the ruled out ones)

Also, we want to test new common letters in both positions.

Let’s try a word that fits _ L A _ E, uses new common letters in positions 1 and 4, and avoids all ruled-out letters.

Good candidate: B L A M E
- B: new common consonant in position 1
- L: already confirmed in position 2

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. Among these, words that contain multiple vowels or common consonants are good choices.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum coverage of high-frequency letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Another good alternative would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and E which are very common.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains A somewhere, but not in position 1.
3. It does not contain R, O, S.

Good letters to try next (common ones not yet ruled out): T, N, L, C, D, U, I, Y, etc.

A useful next guess would be one that:
- Keeps E in position 5.
- Uses A in a different position (not 1).
- Avoids R, O, S.
- Introduces several new common consonants.

""UNTIE"" is a candidate, but it has I and U which are less common. ""ADIEU"" is too long. ""TALKE"" uses T, A, L, K, E — all valid letters and positions. But ""TALKE"" is not a common word.

""ADIEU"" is 5 letters, ends with E, has A not in position 1, and avoids R, O, S. But it's less common.

""PAINT"" is another candidate, but it doesn't end with E.

""FAINT"" — no E.

""VAINT"" — not a word.

""HAIRY"" — no E.

""WHITE"" — ends with E, has A in position 2, uses W, H, I, T. This seems good.

""WHITE"":
- W: new letter
- H: new letter
- I: new letter
- T: new letter
- E: correct in position 5
- A is not present, but we know A is in the word somewhere, so this might be risky.

""CHAIR"" — no E.

""CLEAN"" — no E.

""PLAIN"" — no E.

""GRAIN"" — no E.

""TWINE"" — ends with E, has A? No A. So not useful.

""ADIEU"" — has A, ends with E, avoids R, O, S. But less common.

""ADIEU"" seems the best among less common words, but ""UNTIE"" is more common. However, ""UNTIE"" has I and U which are less common vowels.

""ADIEU"" is more common. Let's go with ""ADIEU"".

But wait, ""ADIEU"" is a common word (as in ""adieu"" meaning goodbye). It uses A, D, I, E, U. Ends with E, has A not in position 1 (it's in position 1, but the feedback said A is in wrong position, so position 1 is wrong, meaning A must be in positions 2-4). So ""ADIEU"" has A in position 1, which is wrong. So this is invalid.

Back to drawing board.

We need a word ending with E, containing A not in position 1, and avoiding R, O, S.

Good candidates:
- ""TALKE"" — but K is less common.
- ""PAINT"" — no E.
- ""WHITE"" — ends with E, A is not present, so we can't test A.
- ""VAINT"" — no E.
- ""PLAIN"" — no E.
- ""FACET"" — ends with T.
- ""FACTS"" — no E.

""ELATE"" — ends with E, has A in position 2, uses E, L, A, T. This seems good.
- E is in position 1 (but we know E is in position 5, so this would be wrong for E).
Wait, no — ""ELATE"" ends with E, so E is in position 5, and A is in position 3. This would be ideal.

""ELATE"":
- E in position 5 (known correct)
- A in position 3 (testing new position for A)
- L, T are new letters
- Avoids R, O, S

This seems optimal.
