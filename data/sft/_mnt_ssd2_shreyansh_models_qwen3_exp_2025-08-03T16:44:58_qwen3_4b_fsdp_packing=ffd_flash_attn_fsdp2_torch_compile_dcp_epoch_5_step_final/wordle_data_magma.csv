### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first word uses a mix of these letters to quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word.

One of the most recommended starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (common starting letter)
- L (common middle letter)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a broad coverage of likely letters and positions to guide our next guesses efficiently.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A somewhere, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has an A (but not in position 3).

3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: R, N, H, C, D, B, G, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: O, I, U (since A is confirmed and E is out).

Let’s pick a word that places A in a different position and uses new common letters. ""CHORD"" is a good choice because:
- It has A in position 4 (not 3, satisfying the feedback).
- It introduces C, H, O, R, D — none of which were in SLATE.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first word uses a mix of these letters to quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word.

One of the most recommended starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (common starting letter)
- L (common middle letter)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a broad coverage of likely letters and positions to guide our next guesses efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A somewhere, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has an A (but not in position 3).
2. Does not have S, L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: R, N, H, C, D, B, G, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: O, I, U (since A is confirmed and E is out).

Let’s pick a word that places A in a different position and uses new common letters. ""CHORD"" is a good choice because:
- It has A in position 4 (not 3, satisfying the feedback).
- It introduces C, H, O, R, D — none of which were in SLATE.

- M(✓) in position 1
- A(✓) in position 2
- _(✓) in position 4
- G(-) in position 4
- A(✓) in position 5

Wait, let me re-read that carefully.

The feedback is:
M(✓) A(✓) N(x) G(-) A(✓)

So:
- Position 1: M is correct (✓)
- Position 2: A is correct (✓)
- Position 3: N is not in the word (x)
- Position 4: G is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- Position 5: A is correct (✓)

So the word structure is:
M A _ _ A
and we know:
- G is in the word, but NOT in position 4 (since it was marked ""-"" for position 4, meaning it exists but is misplaced)
- N is not in the word
- Letters already ruled out: S, L, T, E, C, H, O, R, D, F, I, N

So G must be in position 3, because:
- Position 1, 2, 5 are already M, A, A
- Position 4 is marked ""-"" for G, so G cannot be in position 4
- Therefore G must be in position 3

So the word must be: M A G _ A

Now we need to fill position 4 with a letter that hasn't been ruled out and forms a valid word.

Letters not yet ruled out (from remaining alphabet):
B, K, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for valid 5-letter words of the form M A G _ A:

Possible options:
- MAGMA (valid word)
- MAGGA (not valid)
- MAGPA (not valid)
- MAGBA (not valid)

The only common valid word here is MAGMA.

Let's check:
- M, A, G, M, A
- M in position 1 and 5 are already confirmed
- A in position 2 is confirmed
- G in position 3 is now in the correct position (since it was marked ""-"" in position 4, but we know it must be somewhere, and position 3 is the only remaining spot)
- The second M in position 4 is new; we haven't tested M in position 4 yet.

So MAGMA is a valid next guess.

M(✓) A(✓) N(x) G(-) A(✓)

So:
- Position 1: M is correct (✓)
- Position 2: A is correct (✓)
- Position 3: N is not in the word (x)
- Position 4: G is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- Position 5: A is correct (✓)

So the word structure is:
M A _ _ A
and we know:
- G is in the word, but NOT in position 4 (since it was marked ""-"" for position 4, meaning it exists but is misplaced)
- N is not in the word
- Letters already ruled out: S, L, T, E, C, H, O, R, D, F, I, N

So G must be in position 3, because:
- Position 1, 2, 5 are already M, A, A
- Position 4 is marked ""-"" for G, so G cannot be in position 4
- Therefore G must be in position 3

So the word must be: M A G _ A

Now we need to fill position 4 with a letter that hasn't been ruled out and forms a valid word.

Letters not yet ruled out (from remaining alphabet):
B, K, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for valid 5-letter words of the form M A G _ A:

Possible options:
- MAGMA (valid word)
- MAGGA (not valid)
- MAGPA (not valid)
- MAGBA (not valid)

The only common valid word here is MAGMA.

Let's check:
- M, A, G, M, A
- M in position 1 and 5 are already confirmed
- A in position 2 is confirmed
- G in position 3 is now in the correct position (since it was marked ""-"" in position 4, but we know it must be somewhere, and position 3 is the only remaining spot)
- The second M in position 4 is new; we haven't tested M in position 4 yet.

So MAGMA is a valid next guess.",Guess 5: MAGMA -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) G(✓) M(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
