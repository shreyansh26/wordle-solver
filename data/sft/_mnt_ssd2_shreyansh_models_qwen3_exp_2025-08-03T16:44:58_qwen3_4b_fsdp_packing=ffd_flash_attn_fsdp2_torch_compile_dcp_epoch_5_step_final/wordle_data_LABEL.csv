### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common vowel in English

This should give me good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

2. Does NOT contain S or T
3. Arranges L, A, E differently from their positions in SLATE (L≠2, A≠3, E≠5)

I’ll try to place these letters in new positions while introducing new common letters not yet used. A good candidate is ""LEARN"":
- Contains L, A, E (all required)
- Does not contain S or T
- L is now in position 1 (not 2 ✓)
- A is now in position 3 (but this is the same position as before, which was marked wrong; need to move A elsewhere)
Oops, A cannot stay in position 3. Let me try ""PEARL"":

Step 1 – Extract all known facts  
- Letters NOT in the word: S, T, P, R, C  
- Letters DEFINITELY in the word: L, A, B  
  – L must be in position 5 (✓ in PEARL)  
  – A is now known to be in position 2 (✓ in CABLE)  
  – B is in the word but NOT in position 3 (CABLE showed B(-))  
  – E is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (from SLATE and CABLE)  

Step 2 – Build the current pattern  
Fixed: _ A _ _ L  
We still need:  
- B somewhere in positions 1, 4 (cannot be 3)  
- E somewhere in positions 1, 2, 4 (cannot be 3 or 5)  

Step 3 – Choose two new consonants (from remaining common letters: D, F, G, H, K, M, N, V, W, Y, etc.)  
We’ll place B and E in open spots while introducing a new letter in the remaining slot.

Candidate words:  
- BANAL – but A is already fixed in position 2  
- FABLE – F and L already fixed positions, but E must be in 1 or 4  
- GABLE – G, A, B, L, E → fits: G _ A B L → but L is fixed at 5, so this would be G A B L E → pattern G A B L E → but L is position 4 here, which contradicts L at 5.  
- HABEL – not a common word  
- MABLE – not a common word  
- NABEL – not a common word

We need two new consonants. Let’s try:

- Position 3: new consonant  
- Position 4: remaining consonant  

Example: B A N E L → but E must be in 1 or 4, so E cannot be 4 here.  
E A B L Y – but L is 5, so E A B L Y → pattern E A B L Y → but L is 4, not 5.  

Let’s try B in 1 and E in 4: B A _ E L  
We need one more consonant in position 3. Common consonants left: D, F, G, H, K, M, N, V, W, Y.  
B A D E L → not a word.  
B A G E L – “bagel” is a valid word.  

Check constraints:  
- Letters: B, A, G, E, L  
- Forbidden letters: none of S, T, P, R, C are used  
- Positions:  
  – L at 5 ✓  
  – A at 2 ✓

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common vowel in English

This should give me good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: S, T
- Letters that MUST appear somewhere: L, A, E
- Their positions are all wrong (so L is not in position 2, A is not in position 3, E is not in position 5).

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains L, A, E (all of them must appear)
2. Does NOT contain S or T
3. Arranges L, A, E differently from their positions in SLATE (L≠2, A≠3, E≠5)

I’ll try to place these letters in new positions while introducing new common letters not yet used. A good candidate is ""LEARN"":
- Contains L, A, E (all required)
- Does not contain S or T
- L is now in position 1 (not 2 ✓)
- A is now in position 3 (but this is the same position as before, which was marked wrong; need to move A elsewhere)
Oops, A cannot stay in position 3. Let me try ""PEARL"":
- Contains P, E, A, R, L
- Has all required letters
- L is in position 5 (not 2 ✓)
- A is in position 4 (not 3 ✓)
- E is in position 2 (not 5 ✓)
- New letters introduced: P, R
- No S or T
This seems valid.

2. Letters **definitely in** the word: L, A, E  
   - L is in the **correct position 5** (last letter)  
   - A and E are **in the word but not in positions 3 or 5** respectively  
3. So the pattern so far: _ _ _ _ L  
   with A and E somewhere among positions 1, 2, 3, 4, but not in the restricted spots.

We still need two more distinct letters (not S, T, P, R).  
Good remaining common consonants: N, D, C, G, B, M, etc.

Try to place A and E in fresh spots while introducing two new consonants.  
Candidate word: CABLE  
- C and B are new letters.  
- A in position 2 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed), L locked in position 5.  
- No forbidden letters (S, T, P, R).  
- All checks pass.

Another quick candidate: DANCE – but that repeats no letters and fits, yet CABLE is simpler.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common vowel in English

This should give me good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: S, T
- Letters that MUST appear somewhere: L, A, E
- Their positions are all wrong (so L is not in position 2, A is not in position 3, E is not in position 5).

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains L, A, E (all of them must appear)
2. Does NOT contain S or T
3. Arranges L, A, E differently from their positions in SLATE (L≠2, A≠3, E≠5)

I’ll try to place these letters in new positions while introducing new common letters not yet used. A good candidate is ""LEARN"":
- Contains L, A, E (all required)
- Does not contain S or T
- L is now in position 1 (not 2 ✓)
- A is now in position 3 (but this is the same position as before, which was marked wrong; need to move A elsewhere)
Oops, A cannot stay in position 3. Let me try ""PEARL"":
- Contains P, E, A, R, L
- Has all required letters
- L is in position 5 (not 2 ✓)
- A is in position 4 (not 3 ✓)
- E is in position 2 (not 5 ✓)
- New letters introduced: P, R
- No S or T
This seems valid.

Round 1 – SLATE  
S(x)  L(-)  A(-)  T(x)  E(-)

Round 2 – PEARL  
P(x)  E(-)  A(-)  R(x)  L(✓)

What we now know:

1. Letters **not** in the word: S, T, P, R  
2. Letters **definitely in** the word: L, A, E  
   - L is in the **correct position 5** (last letter)  
   - A and E are **in the word but not in positions 3 or 5** respectively  
3. So the pattern so far: _ _ _ _ L  
   with A and E somewhere among positions 1, 2, 3, 4, but not in the restricted spots.

We still need two more distinct letters (not S, T, P, R).  
Good remaining common consonants: N, D, C, G, B, M, etc.

Try to place A and E in fresh spots while introducing two new consonants.  
Candidate word: CABLE  
- C and B are new letters.  
- A in position 2 (allowed), E in position 4 (allowed), L locked in position 5.  
- No forbidden letters (S, T, P, R).  
- All checks pass.

Another quick candidate: DANCE – but that repeats no letters and fits, yet CABLE is simpler.

Step 1 – Extract all known facts  
- Letters NOT in the word: S, T, P, R, C  
- Letters DEFINITELY in the word: L, A, B  
  – L must be in position 5 (✓ in PEARL)  
  – A is now known to be in position 2 (✓ in CABLE)  
  – B is in the word but NOT in position 3 (CABLE showed B(-))  
  – E is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (from SLATE and CABLE)  

Step 2 – Build the current pattern  
Fixed: _ A _ _ L  
We still need:  
- B somewhere in positions 1, 4 (cannot be 3)  
- E somewhere in positions 1, 2, 4 (cannot be 3 or 5)  

Step 3 – Choose two new consonants (from remaining common letters: D, F, G, H, K, M, N, V, W, Y, etc.)  
We’ll place B and E in open spots while introducing a new letter in the remaining slot.

Candidate words:  
- BANAL – but A is already fixed in position 2  
- FABLE – F and L already fixed positions, but E must be in 1 or 4  
- GABLE – G, A, B, L, E → fits: G _ A B L → but L is fixed at 5, so this would be G A B L E → pattern G A B L E → but L is position 4 here, which contradicts L at 5.  
- HABEL – not a common word  
- MABLE – not a common word  
- NABEL – not a common word  

Wait, let’s list valid positions:  
We have _ A _ _ L  
B must be in 1 or 4  
E must be in 1, 2, or 4 (but 2 is A) → so 1 or 4  

We need two new consonants. Let’s try:  
- Position 1: B or E  
- Position 3: new consonant  
- Position 4: remaining consonant  

Example: B A N E L → but E must be in 1 or 4, so E cannot be 4 here.  
E A B L Y – but L is 5, so E A B L Y → pattern E A B L Y → but L is 4, not 5.  

Let’s try B in 1 and E in 4: B A _ E L  
We need one more consonant in position 3. Common consonants left: D, F, G, H, K, M, N, V, W, Y.  
B A D E L → not a word.  
B A G E L – “bagel” is a valid word.  

Check constraints:  
- Letters: B, A, G, E, L  
- Forbidden letters: none of S, T, P, R, C are used  
- Positions:  
  – L at 5 ✓  
  – A at 2 ✓  
  – B at 1 (allowed)  
  – E at 4 (allowed)  
  – G is new consonant  

Therefore, “bagel” is a valid next guess.

From the five rounds we now know:

Fixed positions:
- Position 2 = A
- Position 4 = E
- Position 5 = L

Forbidden letters (not in the word at all): S, T, P, R, C, G, N, V

Letters still in play (must appear somewhere):
- B (from CABLE: B was in the word but not in position 3)

So the pattern is: _ A _ E L
We need:
- Position 1: any letter not forbidden and not yet ruled out.
- Position 3: must be B (the only remaining letter that must appear).

Remaining allowed consonants for position 1: D, F, H, K, M, W, Y, etc.

Trying common consonants:
- D: pattern D A B E L → “dabel” – not a word.
- F: pattern F A B E L → “fabel” – not a word.
- H: pattern H A B E L → “habel” – not a word.
- K: pattern K A B E L → “kabel” – not a word.
- M: pattern M A B E L → “mabel” – not a word.
- W: pattern W A B E L → “wabel” – not a word.
- Y: pattern Y A B E L → “yabel” – not a word.

Looking at the list, the only common English word that fits is “SABLE”, but S is forbidden.

Realizing that “MABLE” is not a word, and checking the list, the actual valid word is “SABLE” (but S is out). This suggests we might have missed a letter.

Rechecking: the letters we know are in the word are A, B, E, L. The fifth letter must be one of the remaining consonants.

The only common 5-letter word that fits _ A _ E L with B in position 3 is “MABLE”, but that’s not valid. The next possible is “DABLE” – also not valid.

Realizing the mistake: we missed that “FABLE” is a word, but F is allowed and not yet ruled out.

Check: F is not in the forbidden list, and we haven’t tried F yet.

Pattern: F A B E L → “FABLE” – which is a valid English word.

Verify constraints:
- F: new letter, allowed.
- A, B, E, L: all fit the known constraints.
- No forbidden letters used.

Therefore, the correct next guess is “FABLE”.
