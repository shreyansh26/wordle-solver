### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Words with frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, O, I, and C are good starting points. 

A common and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common ending letter

This gives us good coverage of frequent letters in English words.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct position (first letter).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (currently second; must be 3rd, 4th or 5th).
- A, T, E are not in the word at all.

From the latest feedback on SKILL:

- K x (so K is not in the word)
- I ✓ in position 3 (so I is fixed in position 3)
- L ✓ in position 4 (so L is fixed in position 4)
- L ✓ in position 5 (so L is fixed in position 5)

- S in position 1
- I in position 3
- L in position 4
- L in position 5

So the pattern is: S _ I L L

The only missing letter is position 2. The word must be S ? I L L. The possible letters for position 2 are those not yet excluded. From previous guesses we know the following letters are NOT in the word: A, T, E, P, O, K. 

Looking at common English words ending in ""ILL"", the possibilities are limited. The most common ones are:
- SHALL (but H has not been tested yet)
- SWILL (but W has not been tested either)

Between these, SHALL seems more likely because H is a common letter in English words, and SWILL is less common. Let's check SHALL:
- S ✓ position 1
- H (new letter)
- I ✓ position 3
- L ✓ position 4
- L ✓ position 5

This fits all the constraints and tests H, which hasn't been used yet.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Words with frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, O, I, and C are good starting points. 

A common and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common ending letter

This gives us good coverage of frequent letters in English words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct position (first letter).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (currently second; must be 3rd, 4th or 5th).
- A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far:
S _ _ _ _
Letters we know are in the word: S, L
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, T, E

Next, we want a word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Contains L somewhere other than position 2
3. Avoids A, T, E
4. Uses other common letters to test new possibilities

Good candidates: SPOIL, SLING, SHUL, SCUL, SULK, SULI, etc.

""SPOIL"" seems good because:
- Starts with S
- Contains L (in position 4, not 2)
- Avoids A, T, E
- Tests P, O, I which are common letters

Let's try SPOIL.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SPOIL -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(x) I(-) L(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current confirmed facts:
1. Word starts with S (✓ in position 1 on both guesses)
2. L is in the word and is in the correct position 5 (✓ in position 5 on guess 2)
3. Letters NOT in the word: A, T, E, P, O

So the pattern is:
S _ _ _ L

Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
(but we also know from guess 2 that I is in the word, just not in position 4).

From guess 2 (SPOIL) we learned:
- I is in the word but not in position 4.

So I must be in position 2 or 3.

Thus the pattern is:
S I _ _ L  or  S _ I _ L

Common 5-letter words fitting these patterns:
- S I _ _ L: ""SKILL"" (but K and L already have L in position 5, so double L is possible)
- S _ I _ L: ""SWIL"" is not a word, ""SHIL"" is not common, ""SNIL"" is not a word...

Looking at common words:
- SKILL: S K I L L - fits S _ I _ L and uses K (not yet tested)
- SPILL: but P is already excluded
- SHALL: H is possible, but let's check if it fits all constraints

""SKILL"" seems good:
- Starts with S
- Ends with L (position 5 ✓)
- Contains I in position 3 (not 4, so fits I(-) from guess 2)
- Contains K (new letter to test)
- Avoids all excluded letters (A, T, E, P, O)

Let's try SKILL.

The only missing letter is position 2. The word must be S ? I L L. The possible letters for position 2 are those not yet excluded. From previous guesses we know the following letters are NOT in the word: A, T, E, P, O, K.

From the feedback so far we know:

1. Pattern: S _ I L L  (positions 1,3,4,5 are locked)
2. Letters already ruled out: A, T, E, P, O, K, H

So the missing letter in position 2 must be one of the remaining untested consonants: B, C, D, F, G, J, M, N, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking at common English words of the form “S ? I L L”, the only possibilities are:

- SWILL – valid word, uses W (not yet tested)
- STILL – uses T (already ruled out)

- SHALL – already tried (H ruled out)
