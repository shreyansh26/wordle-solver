### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use some of these.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This will give us maximum information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- Letters that must appear somewhere: A, R, E
- Letters that definitely don’t appear: O, S
- Positions to avoid for A, R, E: 
  – A cannot be in position 1
  – R cannot be in position 2
  – E cannot be in position 5

I need a word that contains A, R, E (each once) and avoids O, S. Also, I want to place A, R, E in new positions to gather more info.

A good candidate is “REACT”:
- Contains R, E, A
- Doesn’t contain O or S
- R is now in position 1 (allowed, since feedback only ruled out position 2)
- E is now in position 2 (allowed, since feedback only ruled out position 5)
- A is now in position 3 (allowed, since feedback only ruled out position 1)
- C is a new letter to test

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: react → R(-) E(-) A(-) C(-) T(-)

What we now know for sure:
- Letters that MUST appear in the secret word: A, R, E, C, T
- No letter is excluded yet except O and S (from guess 1) and the letters we have seen so far.
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 3
  – R cannot be in positions 1 or 2
  – E cannot be in positions 2 or 5
  – C cannot be in position 4
  – T cannot be in position 5

We need a valid 5-letter word that uses each of A, R, E, C, T exactly once and respects the position constraints.

Let’s list possible positions for each letter:
- A: positions 2, 4, 5
- R: positions 3, 4, 5
- E: positions 1, 3, 4
- C: positions 1, 2, 3, 5
- T: positions 1, 2, 3, 4

A good way to proceed is to look for common words that use all five letters. The only common English word that uses A, R, E, C, T without repetition is “CATER”.

Let’s check the positions:
- C (1): allowed (not ruled out)
- A (2): allowed (not ruled out)
- T (3): allowed (not ruled out)
- E (4): allowed (not ruled out)
- R (5): allowed (not ruled out)

This respects all the constraints.
