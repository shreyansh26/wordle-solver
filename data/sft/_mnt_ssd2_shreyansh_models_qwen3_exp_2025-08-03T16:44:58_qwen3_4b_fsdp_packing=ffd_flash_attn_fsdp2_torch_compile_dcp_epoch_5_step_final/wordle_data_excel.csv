### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use some of these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm possibilities.

After considering options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has no repeated letters. This gives us maximum coverage of common letters to help narrow down the secret word efficiently.

- A(x) – A is not in the word.

- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (it is currently at position 5).

So far we know:
- The word must contain the letter E somewhere, but not at position 5.
- It must NOT contain A, R, O, or S.
- The remaining unused common letters are T, N, I, L, C, U, D, etc.

We want a second guess that:
1. Keeps E (but not at position 5).
2. Avoids A, R, O, S.
3. Introduces other common letters to maximize information.

Possible candidates: 
- TENTH (but T is repeated)
-UNTIE (but has I and E but not sure)
-UNTIE uses U, N, T, I, E – all new letters except E, and positions E not at 5.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use some of these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm possibilities.

After considering options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has no repeated letters. This gives us maximum coverage of common letters to help narrow down the secret word efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (it is currently at position 5).

So far we know:
- The word must contain the letter E somewhere, but not at position 5.
- It must NOT contain A, R, O, or S.
- The remaining unused common letters are T, N, I, L, C, U, D, etc.

We want a second guess that:
1. Keeps E (but not at position 5).
2. Avoids A, R, O, S.
3. Introduces other common letters to maximize information.

Possible candidates: 
- TENTH (but T is repeated)
-UNTIE (but has I and E but not sure)
-UNTIE uses U, N, T, I, E – all new letters except E, and positions E not at 5.
-UNTIE seems good.

Another candidate is ""UNTIE"" which uses U, N, T, I, E – none of A, R, O, S, and places E at position 4 (not 5).

Let's go with UNTIE.

2. Remaining common letters that have not been tried yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, plus any of the already-eliminated ones if they appear in other positions.

We need a word that:
- Contains E (but not at position 5).
- Contains none of A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “CHEEP”:
- C, H, P are new letters.
- E appears twice (positions 2 and 4), both within allowed positions (not 5).
- It avoids every eliminated letter.

Another candidate is “GLOBE” but E is at position 5 there, which is disallowed.  
“BLOKE” is okay: B, L, K, E; E is at position 4.

From all four guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, H, P, B, K  

Letters confirmed to be in the word:  
E (must be in position 4)  
L (must be somewhere, but not in position 2)  

So the pattern is: _ _ _ E _ with L somewhere in positions 1, 3 or 5.

Remaining common untested letters:  
C, D, F, G, M, V, W, Y, plus any of the already-eliminated ones if they appear in other positions.

We need a word that:
1. Has E in position 4.
2. Contains L but not in position 2.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates:
- C, D, F, G, M, V, W, Y for other positions.
- L can be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Let's try to pick a word that places L in position 1 or 3 and uses other new letters.

For example:
- L _ _ E _ : L could be at start, then need 2 more letters from C, D, F, G, M, V, W, Y.
- _ _ L E _ : L at position 3, then need 1st and 2nd letters from remaining pool.

A good candidate is ""FLEET"" but T is already excluded.
""FLECK"" - C is new, K is already excluded.
""GLIDE"" - I is excluded.
""FLEVE"" - not a valid word.
""CLEVE"" - C and V are new, but E is already in position 4, and L would be position 2 which is disallowed.

Wait, L cannot be in position 2 (from bloke feedback), so let's try:
- L _ _ E _ : L at start, then need 2 new letters. ""LUMEN"" - U and N are excluded.
- _ _ L E _ : L at position 3. ""C L E..."" - C is new, but need 1st and 2nd letters.

""C"" is new, ""L"" must be in word, ""E"" fixed at 4. Try ""CLERK"" - R and K are excluded.
""FLUME"" - U is excluded.
""GLEAM"" - A is excluded.
""CLEAN"" - A and N are excluded.

""V"" is still available. Try ""V"" in first position:
""V _ L E _"" - ""VILLA"" - I and A excluded.
""V _ _ E L"" - ""VEXEL"" - X is not common, but valid. ""VEXEL"" uses V, E, X, L, but X is not ruled out yet, but we want to avoid less common letters. Not ideal.

Try ""M"" in first position:
""M _ L E _"" - ""MOLLY"" - O and L are in word, but O is excluded.
"" _ M L E _"" - ""EMILE"" - I is excluded.

Try ""G"" in first position:
""G _ L E _"" - ""GLOVE"" - O is excluded.
""G _ _ E L"" - ""GUELL"" - U is excluded.

Try ""D"" in first position:
""D _ L E _"" - ""DALLE"" - A is excluded.
""D _ _ E L"" - ""DELLY"" - Y is new, but L is repeated which is okay, but we already know L is in word once.

Wait, we don't know if L appears once or more. The feedback only says L is in word but not in position 2. It could be once or more.

But we want to maximize info. Let's try a word that uses new letters and places L in position 3 or 5.

""F L E E D"" - but E is fixed at 4, and L at 2 is disallowed.
""F L E E D"" is invalid.

Try ""F L E E D"" is invalid. Let's try ""F L E E D"" is not possible.

Actually, let's try ""F L E E D"" is not possible. Let's think differently.

We have:
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Fixed:    _ _ _ E _
Known: L must be in 1, 3, or 5.

Try placing L in position 5:
"" _ _ _ E L"" - Need 1st and 2nd letters from remaining: C, D, F, G, M, V, W, Y.

""C D F G M V W Y""

Possible combinations:
"" C D F G M V W Y "" for positions 1, 2, 3.

We need a valid 5-letter word ending in ""EL"".

Common words ending in ""EL"":
"" B E L"" - B is excluded.
"" D E L"" - ""DELLY"" - Y is new, but D and E are okay, L is in position 5. ""DELLY"" is valid.

Check letters: D, E, L, L, Y - D, L, Y are new or confirmed. E is correct at 4, L is in word at 5, and no excluded letters are used (A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, H, P, B, K are all avoided).

""DELLY"" seems valid.

Alternatively, ""F L E E L"" - but ""FLEEL"" is not a common word.
""G L E E L"" - ""GLEEL"" is not valid.
""M L E E L"" - ""MLEEL"" is not valid.

""DELLY"" is the most plausible valid word here.

"" B E L"" - B is excluded.
"" D E L"" - ""DELLY"" - Y is new, but D and E are okay, L is in position 5. ""DELLY"" is valid.

Check letters: D, E, L, L, Y - D, L, Y are new or confirmed. E is correct at 4, L is in word at 5, and no excluded letters are used (A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, H, P, B, K are all avoided).

""DELLY"" seems valid.

Alternatively, ""F L E E L"" - but ""FLEEL"" is not a common word.
""G L E E L"" - ""GLEEL"" is not valid.
""M L E E L"" - ""MLEEL"" is not valid.

""DELLY"" is the most plausible valid word here.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use some of these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm possibilities.

After considering options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has no repeated letters. This gives us maximum coverage of common letters to help narrow down the secret word efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (it is currently at position 5).

So far we know:
- The word must contain the letter E somewhere, but not at position 5.
- It must NOT contain A, R, O, or S.
- The remaining unused common letters are T, N, I, L, C, U, D, etc.

We want a second guess that:
1. Keeps E (but not at position 5).
2. Avoids A, R, O, S.
3. Introduces other common letters to maximize information.

Possible candidates: 
- TENTH (but T is repeated)
-UNTIE (but has I and E but not sure)
-UNTIE uses U, N, T, I, E – all new letters except E, and positions E not at 5.
-UNTIE seems good.

Another candidate is ""UNTIE"" which uses U, N, T, I, E – none of A, R, O, S, and places E at position 4 (not 5).

Let's go with UNTIE.

Guess 2: untie -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I  
   (only E is confirmed to be in the word, but not at position 5 in arose and not at position 5 in untie, so E must be in one of positions 1-4).

2. Remaining common letters that have not been tried yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, plus any of the already-eliminated ones if they appear in other positions.

We need a word that:
- Contains E (but not at position 5).
- Contains none of A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “CHEEP”:
- C, H, P are new letters.
- E appears twice (positions 2 and 4), both within allowed positions (not 5).
- It avoids every eliminated letter.

Another candidate is “GLOBE” but E is at position 5 there, which is disallowed.  
“BLOKE” is okay: B, L, K, E; E is at position 4.  
But “CHEEP” covers more unused letters (C, H, P).

Let’s go with CHEEP.

Guess 3: cheep -> FEEDBACK: C(-) H(x) E(-) E(✓) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, H, P  
Letters confirmed to be in the word: E (and it must be in the 4th position, because in CHEEP the 4th letter E was marked ✓).

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ E _

We still need to test other common letters: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Have E in the 4th position.
2. Use only untested letters for the other positions.
3. Cover multiple new letters to maximize information.

The word “GLOBE” is invalid (B and L are okay, but O is already excluded).  
“DROME” is invalid (O is excluded).  
“FLEET” uses F, L, E, T; T is excluded.  
“BLOKE” uses B, L, K, E; B, L, K are all new and valid.

Let’s try BLOKE:
- B, L, K are new letters.
- E is in the correct 4th position.
- Avoids every excluded letter.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all four guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, H, P, B, K  

Letters confirmed to be in the word:  
E (must be in position 4)  
L (must be somewhere, but not in position 2)  

So the pattern is: _ _ _ E _ with L somewhere in positions 1, 3 or 5.

Remaining common untested letters:  
C, D, F, G, M, V, W, Y, plus any of the already-eliminated ones if they appear in other positions.

We need a word that:
1. Has E in position 4.
2. Contains L but not in position 2.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates:
- C, D, F, G, M, V, W, Y for other positions.
- L can be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Let's try to pick a word that places L in position 1 or 3 and uses other new letters.

For example:
- L _ _ E _ : L could be at start, then need 2 more letters from C, D, F, G, M, V, W, Y.
- _ _ L E _ : L at position 3, then need 1st and 2nd letters from remaining pool.

A good candidate is ""FLEET"" but T is already excluded.
""FLECK"" - C is new, K is already excluded.
""GLIDE"" - I is excluded.
""FLEVE"" - not a valid word.
""CLEVE"" - C and V are new, but E is already in position 4, and L would be position 2 which is disallowed.

Wait, L cannot be in position 2 (from bloke feedback), so let's try:
- L _ _ E _ : L at start, then need 2 new letters. ""LUMEN"" - U and N are excluded.
- _ _ L E _ : L at position 3. ""C L E..."" - C is new, but need 1st and 2nd letters.

""C"" is new, ""L"" must be in word, ""E"" fixed at 4. Try ""CLERK"" - R and K are excluded.
""FLUME"" - U is excluded.
""GLEAM"" - A is excluded.
""CLEAN"" - A and N are excluded.

""V"" is still available. Try ""V"" in first position:
""V _ L E _"" - ""VILLA"" - I and A excluded.
""V _ _ E L"" - ""VEXEL"" - X is not common, but valid. ""VEXEL"" uses V, E, X, L, but X is not ruled out yet, but we want to avoid less common letters. Not ideal.

Try ""M"" in first position:
""M _ L E _"" - ""MOLLY"" - O and L are in word, but O is excluded.
"" _ M L E _"" - ""EMILE"" - I is excluded.

Try ""G"" in first position:
""G _ L E _"" - ""GLOVE"" - O is excluded.
""G _ _ E L"" - ""GUELL"" - U is excluded.

Try ""D"" in first position:
""D _ L E _"" - ""DALLE"" - A is excluded.
""D _ _ E L"" - ""DELLY"" - Y is new, but L is repeated which is okay, but we already know L is in word once.

Wait, we don't know if L appears once or more. The feedback only says L is in word but not in position 2. It could be once or more.

But we want to maximize info. Let's try a word that uses new letters and places L in position 3 or 5.

""F L E E D"" - but E is fixed at 4, and L at 2 is disallowed.
""F L E E D"" is invalid.

Try ""F L E E D"" is invalid. Let's try ""F L E E D"" is not possible.

Actually, let's try ""F L E E D"" is not possible. Let's think differently.

We have:
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Fixed:    _ _ _ E _
Known: L must be in 1, 3, or 5.

Try placing L in position 5:
"" _ _ _ E L"" - Need 1st and 2nd letters from remaining: C, D, F, G, M, V, W, Y.

""C D F G M V W Y""

Possible combinations:
"" C D F G M V W Y "" for positions 1, 2, 3.

We need a valid 5-letter word ending in ""EL"".

Common words ending in ""EL"":
"" B E L"" - B is excluded.
"" D E L"" - ""DELLY"" - Y is new, but D and E are okay, L is in position 5. ""DELLY"" is valid.

Check letters: D, E, L, L, Y - D, L, Y are new or confirmed. E is correct at 4, L is in word at 5, and no excluded letters are used (A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, H, P, B, K are all avoided).

""DELLY"" seems valid.

Alternatively, ""F L E E L"" - but ""FLEEL"" is not a common word.
""G L E E L"" - ""GLEEL"" is not valid.
""M L E E L"" - ""MLEEL"" is not valid.

""DELLY"" is the most plausible valid word here.

Let's go with DELL Y.

From every guess so far we have ruled out these letters:

NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, H, P, B, K, D, Y

Letters confirmed to be in the word:
- E (must be in position 4)
- L (must be somewhere, but positions 2 and 5 have already been shown NOT to hold L)

So L must sit in position 1 or 3, and position 4 is already E.

We still have these letters left to test:  
C, F, G, J, M, V, W, X, Z (plus any of the already-eliminated ones if they appear in other positions).

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
1. Has E in position 4.
2. Places L in position 1 or 3.
3. Uses only letters that have not yet been ruled out.

Let’s list the possibilities:

- If L is in position 1: L _ _ E _  
  Remaining usable letters: C, F, G, J, M, V, W, X, Z  
  Possible simple combinations:  
  - L C _ E _ → “LCWED” not a word  
  - L F _ E _ → “LFWED” not a word  
  - L V _ E _ → “LVE?” – “LVED” not a word  
  - L W _ E _ → “LWE?” – no valid 5-letter word here.

- If L is in position 3: _ _ L E _  
  Usable letters again: C, F, G, J, M, V, W, X, Z  
  - C F L E _ → “CFLER” not a word  
  - M V L E _ → “MVLER” not a word  
  - V I L E _ – I is already ruled out  
  - C C L E _ – C is fine, but “C C L E _” gives “CCLER” not a word  
  - F L E E _ – but we need L in position 3 here, so “F _ L E _”  
    - “F” + “C” + “L” + “E” + “M” → “FCLEM” not a word  
    - “F” + “V” + “L” + “E” + “M” → “FVLEM” not a word  
    - “F” + “J” + “L” + “E” + “M” → “FJLEM” not a word  
    - “G” + “M” + “L” + “E” + “Y” – Y is ruled out  
    - “G” + “M” + “L” + “E” + “X” → “GML EX” – no.

Scanning the remaining letters, the only common English word that fits is:

C F L E W → “CFL EW” – no.  
Wait – “C” “F” “L” “E” “W” – not a word.

Actually, there is one: “C L E A R” – but A is ruled out.

“F L E W S” – but S is ruled out.

“G L E A M” – A is ruled out.

“C L E A N” – A and N are ruled out.

“F L E E D” – D is ruled out.

“G L E E D” – D is ruled out.

“M L E E D” – D is ruled out.

“V I L E D” – I and D are ruled out.

“C C L E A” – A is ruled out.

“F L E E C” – C is fine, but “F L E E C” is not a word.

Wait – let’s step back.

We have:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Fixed:    _ _ _ E _  
L must be in 1 or 3.

Let’s try:

L in 1: L _ _ E _  
We need two more letters (positions 2 and 3) from the remaining pool that form a valid word.

Possible valid words with L in 1 and E in 4:

- L E G E M – but E is fixed at 4, so this doesn’t fit.  
- L E V E L – but E is fixed at 4, so this doesn’t fit.  
- L E V E R – R is ruled out.  
- L E W E L – L is in 5, but we need L somewhere else.  
- L E W E R – R is ruled out.  
- L E V E L – doesn’t fit E in 4.

We need to find a word like L _ _ E _ or _ _ L E _.

Looking at the remaining letters: C, F, G, J, M, V, W, X, Z.

Valid words:

- L E V E L – doesn’t fit E in 4.  
- L E G E M – doesn’t fit.  
- Actually, “L E V E L” is invalid because E is in 2 and 4, but we only have one E confirmed.

We must use each letter only as many times as it appears in the actual word.

But we don’t know if E appears once or more. The feedback only shows one E in each guess.

However, the word could have multiple E’s. Let’s consider that possibility.

If we allow multiple E’s, we could try:

L E E V E – but E is in 2 and 4, and we don’t know if that’s valid.

But let’s look for actual words.

One valid word that fits is:

L E V E L – but as said, E is in 2 and 4, and we don’t have info on multiple E’s.

Another word: L E G E M – doesn’t fit.

Actually, there is a word: L E V E L – but it has E in 2 and 4.

But the feedback from guess 3 (cheep) shows E in position 4 was ✓, so E must be in 4, but it doesn’t preclude E in other positions.

However, the feedback from guess 4 (bloke) shows E in position 4 was ✓, so E must be in 4, but it doesn’t say anything about other E’s.

But the word could have multiple E’s. Let’s try:

L E V E L – but this has E in 2 and 4, and we don’t know if that’s allowed.

Another word: L E W E L – same issue.

Actually, the only common word that fits L _ _ E _ is “L E V E L”, but it has E in 2 and 4.

But the feedback from guess 3 shows E in 4 was ✓, so E must be in 4, but it doesn’t preclude E in 2.

However, the word could have multiple E’s. Let’s try:

“L E V E L” – but this has E in 2 and 4, and we don’t have info against it.

But let’s try a word with L in 3:

_ _ L E _

Possible letters: C, F, G, J, M, V, W, X, Z.

Valid words:

- C F L E W – not a word.  
- C G L E W – not a word.  
- F L E E D – D is ruled out.  
- G L E E D – D is ruled out.  
- M L E E D – D is ruled out.  
- V I L E D – I is ruled out.  
- C C L E A – A is ruled out.  
- C F L E W – not a word.  
- Actually, “C L E A R” – A and R are ruled out.  
- “F L E W S” – S is ruled out.  
- “G L E A M” – A is ruled out.  
- “C L E A N” – A and N are ruled out.  
- “F L E E C” – not a word.  
- “M L E E C” – not a word.  
- “V I L E C” – I is ruled out.  

We must consider that the word might use letters we haven’t tried yet.

Looking at the remaining letters: C, F, G, J, M, V, W, X, Z.

The only common word that fits is:

“C L E A R” – ruled out due to A and R.

“F L E W S” – ruled out due to S.

“G L E A M” – ruled out due to A.

“C L E A N” – ruled out due to A and N.

“F L E E D” – ruled out due to D.

“G L E E D” – ruled out due to D.

“M L E E D” – ruled out due to D.

“V I L E D” – ruled out due to I and D.

“C C L E A” – ruled out due to A.

“F L E E C” – not a word.

“M L E E C” – not a word.

“V I L E C” – not a word.

“G L E E C” – not a word.

Wait – let’s try:

“C L E A R” – ruled out.

“F L E W S” – ruled out.

“G L E A M” – ruled out.

“C L E A N” – ruled out.

“F L E E D” – ruled out.

“G L E E D” – ruled out.

“M L E E D” – ruled out.

“V I L E D” – ruled out.

“C C L E A” – ruled out.

“F L E E C” – not a word.

“M L E E C” – not a word.

“V I L E C” – not a word.

“G L E E C” – not a word.

“J” is still available. Try:

“J” in position 1 or 2 or 3.

But we need L in 1 or 3.

Try:

L in 1: L _ _ E _  
Possible letters for 2 and 3: C, F, G, J, M, V, W, X, Z.

Valid words:

- L E V E L – but E is in 2 and 4, and we don’t know if that’s allowed.  
- L E C E L – not a word.  
- L E G E L – not a word.  
- L E J E L – not a word.  
- L E M E L – not a word.  
- L E V E L – this is actually a valid word, “LEVEL”, but it has E in 2 and 4.  

“LEVEL” is a valid 5-letter word, has E in 2 and 4, and uses L in 1 and 5. But we know E must be in 4, and this doesn’t conflict with that. However, the feedback only shows one E in each guess, so we don’t have info on multiple E’s.

But the word could have multiple E’s. Let’s try “LEVEL”.

Letters used: L, E, V, E, L – none are ruled out except D, Y, etc., which aren’t used here.

So “LEVEL” is a valid candidate.

Another candidate is “LEVER” – but R is ruled out.

“LEGEN” – N is ruled out.

“LEGEN” – N is ruled out.

“LEGEN” – not a word.

Another word: “L E W E L” – not a word.

“L E C E L” – not a word.

“L E G E L” – not a word.

“L E J E L” – not a word.

“L E M E L” – not a word.

“L E V E L” – this seems to be the only valid word.

Thus, the best next guess is “LEVEL”.

<guess>level</guess>",level,"From every guess so far we have ruled out these letters:

NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, H, P, B, K, D, Y

Letters confirmed to be in the word:
- E (must be in position 4)
- L (must be somewhere, but positions 2 and 5 have already been shown NOT to hold L)

So L must sit in position 1 or 3, and position 4 is already E.

We still have these letters left to test:  
C, F, G, J, M, V, W, X, Z (plus any of the already-eliminated ones if they appear in other positions).

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
1. Has E in position 4.
2. Places L in position 1 or 3.
3. Uses only letters that have not yet been ruled out.

Let’s list the possibilities:

- If L is in position 1: L _ _ E _  
  Remaining usable letters: C, F, G, J, M, V, W, X, Z  
  Possible simple combinations:  
  - L C _ E _ → “LCWED” not a word  
  - L F _ E _ → “LFWED” not a word  
  - L V _ E _ → “LVE?” – “LVED” not a word  
  - L W _ E _ → “LWE?” – no valid 5-letter word here.

- If L is in position 3: _ _ L E _  
  Usable letters again: C, F, G, J, M, V, W, X, Z  
  - C F L E _ → “CFLER” not a word  
  - M V L E _ → “MVLER” not a word  
  - V I L E _ – I is already ruled out  
  - C C L E _ – C is fine, but “C C L E _” gives “CCLER” not a word  
  - F L E E _ – but we need L in position 3 here, so “F _ L E _”  
    - “F” + “C” + “L” + “E” + “M” → “FCLEM” not a word  
    - “F” + “V” + “L” + “E” + “M” → “FVLEM” not a word  
    - “F” + “J” + “L” + “E” + “M” → “FJLEM” not a word  
    - “G” + “M” + “L” + “E” + “Y” – Y is ruled out  
    - “G” + “M” + “L” + “E” + “X” → “GML EX” – no.

Scanning the remaining letters, the only common English word that fits is:

C F L E W → “CFL EW” – no.  
Wait – “C” “F” “L” “E” “W” – not a word.

Actually, there is one: “C L E A R” – but A is ruled out.

“F L E W S” – but S is ruled out.
