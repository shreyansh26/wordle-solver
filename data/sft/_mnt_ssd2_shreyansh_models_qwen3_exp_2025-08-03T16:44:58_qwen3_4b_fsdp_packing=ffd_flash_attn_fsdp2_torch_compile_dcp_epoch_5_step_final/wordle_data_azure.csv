For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C are among the most common in English. A good starting word should cover several of these. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with CRANE as it includes four very common letters (C, R, A, N) plus E, giving me good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains R and A somewhere, but not in positions 2 or 3 respectively.
- Does not contain C or N.

I need a word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Has R somewhere except position 2.
3. Has A somewhere except position 3.
4. No C or N.
5. Uses other common letters to maximize info.

Possible letters to try: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

Some candidate words:
- STARE (but has A in position 3 which we know is wrong)
- OATER (but has A in position 3)
- TRAPE (but has A in position 3)
- GRATE (but has A in position 3)
- STARE is invalid because A is in position 3.
- OATER: O A T E, but A is position 2, which is allowed since we only know A is not in position 3.
- TRAPE: T R A P E, but A is position 3 which is invalid.

Wait, I need to end with E. Let me think differently:

Possible positions:
- R could be in 1, 3, 4 (not 2)

- VIGOR: ends with R.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C are among the most common in English. A good starting word should cover several of these. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with CRANE as it includes four very common letters (C, R, A, N) plus E, giving me good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains R and A somewhere, but not in positions 2 or 3 respectively.
- Does not contain C or N.

I need a word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Has R somewhere except position 2.
3. Has A somewhere except position 3.
4. No C or N.
5. Uses other common letters to maximize info.

Possible letters to try: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

Some candidate words:
- STARE (but has A in position 3 which we know is wrong)
- OATER (but has A in position 3)
- TRAPE (but has A in position 3)
- GRATE (but has A in position 3)
- STARE is invalid because A is in position 3.
- OATER: O A T E, but A is position 2, which is allowed since we only know A is not in position 3.
- TRAPE: T R A P E, but A is position 3 which is invalid.
- GRATE: G R A T E, A is position 3 which is invalid.
- PRASE: P R A S E, A is position 3 which is invalid.
- SNAKE: but has N which we know is invalid.
- GRIME: G R I M E, but missing A.
- CRIME: has C which is invalid.
- BRIME: has B, but not sure if better.
- FRAME: F R A M E, A is position 3 which is invalid.
- DRASE: D R A S E, A is position 3 which is invalid.

Better options:
- OATER: O A T E R, but ends with R, not E.
- STARE: S T A R E, but A is position 3 which is invalid.
- CRATE: has C which is invalid.
- GRATE: already seen.
- TRAPE: already seen.

Wait, I need to end with E. Let me think differently:
- _ _ _ _ E
- Contains R and A somewhere, not in positions 2 or 3 respectively.
- No C or N.

Possible positions:
- R could be in 1, 3, 4 (not 2)
- A could be in 1, 2, 4 (not 3)

Let me try to construct:
- If R is in 1: R _ _ _ E
  - A must be in 2 or 4
  - Possible: R A _ _ E, but A is in 2 which is allowed.
  - Words: R A _ _ E like RADGE? Not valid.
  - R _ A _ E: R _ A _ E, need 2nd and 4th letters.
    - R O A D E: but D is ok, but O is allowed.
    - R I A M E: but M is allowed.
    - R A I D E: but A is in 2, which is allowed.
    - R A I D E: but D is allowed, I is allowed.
    - RAIDE: valid word? Not common.
    - RAISE: but S is allowed, but we have to check if it's better.

- If R is in 3: _ _ R _ E
  - A must be in 1, 2, or 4
  - A could be in 1: A _ R _ E
    - A R is allowed, but need 2nd and 4th letters.
    - A R R O E: but R is repeated, and O is allowed.
    - A R M E E: but M is allowed.
    - A R I V E: but I, V are allowed.
    - A R I V E: ARIVE is valid? Not common.

    - T A R O E: but T, O are allowed.
    - D A R E E: but D is allowed.
    - G A R E E: but G is allowed.

- If R is in 4: _ _ _ R E
  - A must be in 1, 2, or 3
  - A could be in 1: A _ _ R E
    - A M E R E: but M, E are allowed.

    - B R A R E: but B, R are allowed.
    - D R A R E: but D, R are allowed.

- R A I D E: RAIDE is not common.
- A R M E E: ARMEE is valid.
- T A R O E: TAROE is not common.

- S T A R E: STARE is invalid because A is position 3.
- P R A R E: PRARE is not common.
- B R A R E: BRARE is not common.

Better options:

- VIGOR: ends with R.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C are among the most common in English. A good starting word should cover several of these. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with CRANE as it includes four very common letters (C, R, A, N) plus E, giving me good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains R and A somewhere, but not in positions 2 or 3 respectively.
- Does not contain C or N.

I need a word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Has R somewhere except position 2.
3. Has A somewhere except position 3.
4. No C or N.
5. Uses other common letters to maximize info.

Possible letters to try: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

Some candidate words:
- STARE (but has A in position 3 which we know is wrong)
- OATER (but has A in position 3)
- TRAPE (but has A in position 3)
- GRATE (but has A in position 3)
- STARE is invalid because A is in position 3.
- OATER: O A T E, but A is position 2, which is allowed since we only know A is not in position 3.
- TRAPE: T R A P E, but A is position 3 which is invalid.
- GRATE: G R A T E, A is position 3 which is invalid.
- PRASE: P R A S E, A is position 3 which is invalid.
- SNAKE: but has N which we know is invalid.
- GRIME: G R I M E, but missing A.
- CRIME: has C which is invalid.
- BRIME: has B, but not sure if better.
- FRAME: F R A M E, A is position 3 which is invalid.
- DRASE: D R A S E, A is position 3 which is invalid.

Better options:
- OATER: O A T E R, but ends with R, not E.
- STARE: S T A R E, but A is position 3 which is invalid.
- CRATE: has C which is invalid.
- GRATE: already seen.
- TRAPE: already seen.

Wait, I need to end with E. Let me think differently:
- _ _ _ _ E
- Contains R and A somewhere, not in positions 2 or 3 respectively.
- No C or N.

Possible positions:
- R could be in 1, 3, 4 (not 2)
- A could be in 1, 2, 4 (not 3)

Let me try to construct:
- If R is in 1: R _ _ _ E
  - A must be in 2 or 4
  - Possible: R A _ _ E, but A is in 2 which is allowed.
  - Words: R A _ _ E like RADGE? Not valid.
  - R _ A _ E: R _ A _ E, need 2nd and 4th letters.
    - R O A D E: but D is ok, but O is allowed.
    - R I A M E: but M is allowed.
    - R A I D E: but A is in 2, which is allowed.
    - R A I D E: but D is allowed, I is allowed.
    - RAIDE: valid word? Not common.
    - RAISE: but S is allowed, but we have to check if it's better.

- If R is in 3: _ _ R _ E
  - A must be in 1, 2, or 4
  - A could be in 1: A _ R _ E
    - A R is allowed, but need 2nd and 4th letters.
    - A R R O E: but R is repeated, and O is allowed.
    - A R M E E: but M is allowed.
    - A R I V E: but I, V are allowed.
    - A R I V E: ARIVE is valid? Not common.
    - A R I O E: but O is allowed.
    - A R M E E: ARMEE is valid.
  - A could be in 2: _ A R _ E
    - S A R E E: but S is allowed.
    - B A R E E: but B is allowed.
    - T A R O E: but T, O are allowed.
    - D A R E E: but D is allowed.
    - G A R E E: but G is allowed.

- If R is in 4: _ _ _ R E
  - A must be in 1, 2, or 3
  - A could be in 1: A _ _ R E
    - A M E R E: but M, E are allowed.
    - A R E R E: but R is repeated.
    - A S E R E: but S is allowed.
    - A T E R E: but T is allowed.
    - A R E R E: already seen.
    - A T E R E: is valid.
  - A could be in 2: _ A _ R E
    - S A M R E: but M, S are allowed.
    - T A M R E: but T, M are allowed.
    - P A R R E: but P, R are allowed.
  - A could be in 3: _ _ A R E
    - S T A R E: but S, T are allowed.
    - B R A R E: but B, R are allowed.
    - D R A R E: but D, R are allowed.
    - P R A R E: but P, R are allowed.

From these, some valid words:
- STARE: but A is position 3 which is invalid.
- R A I D E: RAIDE is not common.
- A R M E E: ARMEE is valid.
- T A R O E: TAROE is not common.
- A T E R E: ATERE is not common.
- S T A R E: STARE is invalid because A is position 3.
- P R A R E: PRARE is not common.
- B R A R E: BRARE is not common.

Better options:
- ARMED: but ends with D, not E.
- ARMOR: but ends with R, not E.
- ARMEE: valid, but might be too obscure.
- TIGER: but ends with R, not E.
- VIGOR: ends with R.
- AGREE: but has G, and A is position 1, R is position 3, E is 5.
  - AGREE: A G R E E
    - A is position 1: allowed (only restriction was not position 3)
    - R is position 3: allowed (only restriction was not position 2)
    - E is position 5: correct.
    - G is allowed (not previously excluded).
    - This seems valid.

AGREE:
- Letters: A, G, R, E, E
- Ends with E (✓)
- Contains R (position 3, not 2) and A (position 1, not 3) ✓
- No C or N ✓
- G is a new letter to test.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - C and N are absent.

2. AGREE → A(✓) G(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓)
   - A is now fixed in position 1.
   - E remains fixed in position 5.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 or 3 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 again. So R must be in position 4.
   - E is in position 5, so the second E in position 4 is actually in the wrong place, confirming R is in position 4 (since R is not in 2 or 3, and 4 is left).

So far we have:
- Position 1: A
- Position 5: E
- Position 4: R
- Positions 2 and 3: to be determined, but A and R are already placed.

Letters already ruled out: C, N, G.

We still need two more letters (positions 2 and 3) that are not C, N, G, and they must form a valid word with A, R, E already placed.

Possible letters left: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching the pattern A _ _ R E.

Possible candidates:

- A S I R E → ""ASIRE"" is not a word.
- A P I R E → ""APIRE"" is not a word.

- I in position 3 (new letter to test)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C are among the most common in English. A good starting word should cover several of these. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with CRANE as it includes four very common letters (C, R, A, N) plus E, giving me good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains R and A somewhere, but not in positions 2 or 3 respectively.
- Does not contain C or N.

I need a word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Has R somewhere except position 2.
3. Has A somewhere except position 3.
4. No C or N.
5. Uses other common letters to maximize info.

Possible letters to try: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

Some candidate words:
- STARE (but has A in position 3 which we know is wrong)
- OATER (but has A in position 3)
- TRAPE (but has A in position 3)
- GRATE (but has A in position 3)
- STARE is invalid because A is in position 3.
- OATER: O A T E, but A is position 2, which is allowed since we only know A is not in position 3.
- TRAPE: T R A P E, but A is position 3 which is invalid.
- GRATE: G R A T E, A is position 3 which is invalid.
- PRASE: P R A S E, A is position 3 which is invalid.
- SNAKE: but has N which we know is invalid.
- GRIME: G R I M E, but missing A.
- CRIME: has C which is invalid.
- BRIME: has B, but not sure if better.
- FRAME: F R A M E, A is position 3 which is invalid.
- DRASE: D R A S E, A is position 3 which is invalid.

Better options:
- OATER: O A T E R, but ends with R, not E.
- STARE: S T A R E, but A is position 3 which is invalid.
- CRATE: has C which is invalid.
- GRATE: already seen.
- TRAPE: already seen.

Wait, I need to end with E. Let me think differently:
- _ _ _ _ E
- Contains R and A somewhere, not in positions 2 or 3 respectively.
- No C or N.

Possible positions:
- R could be in 1, 3, 4 (not 2)
- A could be in 1, 2, 4 (not 3)

Let me try to construct:
- If R is in 1: R _ _ _ E
  - A must be in 2 or 4
  - Possible: R A _ _ E, but A is in 2 which is allowed.
  - Words: R A _ _ E like RADGE? Not valid.
  - R _ A _ E: R _ A _ E, need 2nd and 4th letters.
    - R O A D E: but D is ok, but O is allowed.
    - R I A M E: but M is allowed.
    - R A I D E: but A is in 2, which is allowed.
    - R A I D E: but D is allowed, I is allowed.
    - RAIDE: valid word? Not common.
    - RAISE: but S is allowed, but we have to check if it's better.

- If R is in 3: _ _ R _ E
  - A must be in 1, 2, or 4
  - A could be in 1: A _ R _ E
    - A R is allowed, but need 2nd and 4th letters.
    - A R R O E: but R is repeated, and O is allowed.
    - A R M E E: but M is allowed.
    - A R I V E: but I, V are allowed.
    - A R I V E: ARIVE is valid? Not common.
    - A R I O E: but O is allowed.
    - A R M E E: ARMEE is valid.
  - A could be in 2: _ A R _ E
    - S A R E E: but S is allowed.
    - B A R E E: but B is allowed.
    - T A R O E: but T, O are allowed.
    - D A R E E: but D is allowed.
    - G A R E E: but G is allowed.

- If R is in 4: _ _ _ R E
  - A must be in 1, 2, or 3
  - A could be in 1: A _ _ R E
    - A M E R E: but M, E are allowed.
    - A R E R E: but R is repeated.
    - A S E R E: but S is allowed.
    - A T E R E: but T is allowed.
    - A R E R E: already seen.
    - A T E R E: is valid.
  - A could be in 2: _ A _ R E
    - S A M R E: but M, S are allowed.
    - T A M R E: but T, M are allowed.
    - P A R R E: but P, R are allowed.
  - A could be in 3: _ _ A R E
    - S T A R E: but S, T are allowed.
    - B R A R E: but B, R are allowed.
    - D R A R E: but D, R are allowed.
    - P R A R E: but P, R are allowed.

From these, some valid words:
- STARE: but A is position 3 which is invalid.
- R A I D E: RAIDE is not common.
- A R M E E: ARMEE is valid.
- T A R O E: TAROE is not common.
- A T E R E: ATERE is not common.
- S T A R E: STARE is invalid because A is position 3.
- P R A R E: PRARE is not common.
- B R A R E: BRARE is not common.

Better options:
- ARMED: but ends with D, not E.
- ARMOR: but ends with R, not E.
- ARMEE: valid, but might be too obscure.
- TIGER: but ends with R, not E.
- VIGOR: ends with R.
- AGREE: but has G, and A is position 1, R is position 3, E is 5.
  - AGREE: A G R E E
    - A is position 1: allowed (only restriction was not position 3)
    - R is position 3: allowed (only restriction was not position 2)
    - E is position 5: correct.
    - G is allowed (not previously excluded).
    - This seems valid.

AGREE:
- Letters: A, G, R, E, E
- Ends with E (✓)
- Contains R (position 3, not 2) and A (position 1, not 3) ✓
- No C or N ✓
- G is a new letter to test.

2. AGREE → A(✓) G(x) R(-) E(-) E(✓)
   - A is now fixed in position 1.
   - E remains fixed in position 5.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 or 3 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 again. So R must be in position 4.
   - E is in position 5, so the second E in position 4 is actually in the wrong place, confirming R is in position 4 (since R is not in 2 or 3, and 4 is left).

So far we have:
- Position 1: A
- Position 5: E
- Position 4: R
- Positions 2 and 3: to be determined, but A and R are already placed.

Letters already ruled out: C, N, G.

We still need two more letters (positions 2 and 3) that are not C, N, G, and they must form a valid word with A, R, E already placed.

Possible letters left: B, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching the pattern A _ _ R E.

Possible candidates:
- A B I R E → but ""ABIRE"" is not a word.
- A M I R E → ""AMIRE"" is not a word.
- A L I R E → ""ALIRE"" is not a word.
- A S I R E → ""ASIRE"" is not a word.
- A P I R E → ""APIRE"" is not a word.
- A F I R E → ""AFIRE"" is a valid word.

""AFIRE"" fits perfectly:
- A(✓) in position 1
- F in position 2 (new letter to test)
- I in position 3 (new letter to test)
- R(✓) in position 4
- E(✓) in position 5

This is a strong logical guess based on the constraints gathered.

From the three rounds we now know:

1. Positions fixed:
   - 1: A
   - 4: R
   - 5: E

2. Letters definitely absent: C, N, G, F, I

3. Therefore the word must be of the form:
   A _ _ R E  
   where the blanks are not C, N, G, F, I.

4. Common remaining consonants and vowels for positions 2 and 3:
   B, D, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

5. Looking for real 5-letter English words that fit A _ _ R E:
   - A B O R E → ""ABORE"" – not valid
   - A M O R E → ""AMORE"" – valid (Spanish loan, but accepted in English)
   - A L O R E → ""ALORE"" – valid
   - A S O R E → ""ASORE"" – not valid
   - A T O R E → ""ATORE"" – not valid
   - A D O R E → ""ADOR E"" – not valid
   - A L O R E → ""ALORE"" is indeed a valid word meaning ""the state of being aloof"".

""ALORE"" uses A, L, O, R, E and satisfies all constraints:

We now know:

1. Pattern: A _ _ R E  
   with positions 1 (A), 4 (R), 5 (E) locked.

2. Letters already ruled out: C, N, G, F, I, L, O.

3. Remaining possible letters for positions 2 and 3 (from the alphabet excluding the ruled-out ones):
   B, D, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits A _ _ R E with only those letters in the two middle positions.

   - A D D R E → “ADDER” is the only common word that fits.

“ADDER” uses A, D, D, R, E and satisfies all constraints:
