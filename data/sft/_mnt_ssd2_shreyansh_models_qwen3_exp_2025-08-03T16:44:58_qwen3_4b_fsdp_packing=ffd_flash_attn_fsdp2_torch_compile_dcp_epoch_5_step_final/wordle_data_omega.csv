### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) without any duplicates. This will help me quickly identify which of these key letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on “arose” we now know:

- A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R is not in the word at all  
- O is in the word but not in position 3  
- S is not in the word at all  
- E is in the word but not in position 5  

Letters we can eliminate: R, S  
Letters we still need to test: A, O, E (but we already know they’re somewhere else)  
Common remaining letters we haven’t tried yet: T, L, N, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Uses A, O, E in different positions than before (A not 1st, O not 3rd, E not 5th)
2. Adds new common letters (T, L, N, etc.)

A good candidate is “OCEAN”:
- O moves from position 3 to 1 (new)  
- C and E are new letters (E moves from 5th to 3rd, which is allowed because we only know E is not 5th)  
- A is placed in a new position (4th)  
- Uses common letters C and N

This should reveal more about possible positions of A, O, E and introduce two new letters (C, N) to test.

From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R and S are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. ocean → O(✓) C(x) E(✓) A(-) N(x)
   - O is in the word AND in position 1 (✓).
   - C and N are not in the word.
   - E is in the word but not in position 4 (since it shows ✓ in position 3, so E is in position 3).
   - A is in the word but not in position 4 (since it shows - in position 4).

So far we know:
- Position 1: O (fixed)
- Position 3: E (fixed)
- Letters in the word: O, A, E
- Letters not in the word: R, S, C, N
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4
- O is in position 1 (so position 1 is O)
- E is in position 3 (so position 3 is E)

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O as first letter
- E as third letter
- Must contain A somewhere (positions 2 or 5, since 1 and 4 are taken by O and E)
- No R, S, C, N
- Other positions can be filled with new common letters (T, L, D, I, M, P, U, etc.)

Possible structure: O _ E _ _

A must be in position 2 or 5.

Let's try O A E _ _ (but that would be OAE _ _, which is not a valid word)
Or O _ E _ A

Valid words with this structure:
- OAT E A → but T is common, let's try OAT E A → but we need 5 letters
- Actually, let's think of valid 5-letter words starting with O and having E in position 3:
  - O B E A T
  - O D E A T
  - O P E A T
  - O T E A M
  - O M E A T
  - O D E A L
  - O B E A N (but N is eliminated)
  - O P E A R (R is eliminated)
  - O T E A M is valid
  - O M E A T is valid
  - O D E A L is valid

Let's pick one of these. ""OTEAR"" is invalid (R is eliminated), ""OMATE"" is valid but uses M and T which are new letters. ""OBEAT"" is valid. 

But ""OBEAT"" uses B which is new. Let's go with ""OMATE"" as it tests M and T.

Wait, let me check:
- O M A T E
- Positions: 1=O, 2=M, 3=E, 4=T, 5=E
But E is already in position 3, so this would have two E's, which is possible, but we don't know if word has repeated letters. 

Better to pick a word with A in position 5: O _ E _ A

Possible: O T E A A (invalid)
O P E A A (invalid)
O D E A A (invalid)
O B E A A (invalid)

No good. So A must be in position 2: O A E _ _

But OAE _ _ is not a valid start. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. The word must have O in position 1, E in position 3, and A somewhere (not 1 or 4), so A must be in position 2 or 5. 

But O _ E _ A is possible:
- O B E A A (invalid)
- O T E A A (invalid)
- O M E A A (invalid)

No valid words here. So A must be in position 2: O A E _ _

But O A E _ _ is not a valid start. 

Wait, let me think differently: maybe the word has only O, E, A, plus two new letters. 

Structure: O _ E _ A
Possible: O M E T A (valid word: OMEGA)

Check:
- O(✓) in position 1
- M new
- E(✓) in position 3
- G new
- A in position 5 (allowed since A is not in position 1 or 4)

This tests M and G as new letters while keeping O and E fixed, and A in a new position (5).

""OMEGA"" is a valid 5-letter word.

From the feedback:
- O is fixed in position 1
- E is fixed in position 3
