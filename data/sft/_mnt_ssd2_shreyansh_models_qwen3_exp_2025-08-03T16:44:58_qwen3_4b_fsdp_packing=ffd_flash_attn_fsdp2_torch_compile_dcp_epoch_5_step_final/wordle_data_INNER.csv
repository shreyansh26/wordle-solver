### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and common consonants. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This will help us quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the two rounds of feedback:

   - Letters out: A, O, S  

2. untie → U(x) N(✓) T(x) I(-) E(-)  
   - N is now locked in position 3.  
   - R and E are still in the word but not in their previous spots.  
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.  
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (so E must be in 1, 2, or 4).  
   - U and T are out.

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ _ N _ _ (position 3 = N)  
- Must contain: R, E, I  
- Must not contain: A, O, S, U, T  
- E cannot be in 5 (already satisfied) or 2 (because in arose it was in 5 and now must move).  
- E must be in 1 or 4.  
- I cannot be in 4 (from untie feedback), so I must be in 1, 2, or 5.  
- R cannot be in 2 (from arose) or 4 (from untie), so R must be in 1 or 5.

Let’s list possible placements:
- Position 1: E or I or R  
- Position 2: I (since E cannot be here and R is either 1 or 5)  
- Position 3: N (locked)  
- Position 4: E (since E must be in 1 or 4 and 1 is open)  
- Position 5: remaining letter (I or R)

One valid arrangement: E I N R E  
But that repeats E twice, which is impossible.

Another arrangement: R I N E E – also impossible.

Wait, we only have 5 positions and must use R, E, I once each.  
So the word must be a permutation of R, E, I plus two other consonants not yet ruled out.  
Good consonants left: C, D, L, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, etc.

Let’s try to place:
- N in 3  
- E must be in 1 or 4  
- I must be in 1, 2, or 5  
- R must be in 1 or 5  

Try E in 1 and R in 5:
E _ N _ R  
I must go in 2 or 4 (but 4 is open).  
If I go in 2: E I N _ R → need a consonant for 4.  
Possible consonants: C, D, L, P, M, etc.  
""EDINR"" – no, not a word.  
""ELINR"" – no.  
""EPINR"" – no.  

Try I in 2 and E in 4:

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and common consonants. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This will help us quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

- Must contain: R, E, I  
- Must not contain: A, O, S, U, T  
- E cannot be in 5 (already satisfied) or 2 (because in arose it was in 5 and now must move).  
- E must be in 1 or 4.  
- I cannot be in 4 (from untie feedback), so I must be in 1, 2, or 5.  
- R cannot be in 2 (from arose) or 4 (from untie), so R must be in 1 or 5.

Let’s list possible placements:
- Position 1: E or I or R  
- Position 2: I (since E cannot be here and R is either 1 or 5)  
- Position 3: N (locked)  
- Position 4: E (since E must be in 1 or 4 and 1 is open)  
- Position 5: remaining letter (I or R)

One valid arrangement: E I N R E  
But that repeats E twice, which is impossible.

Another arrangement: R I N E E – also impossible.

Wait, we only have 5 positions and must use R, E, I once each.  
So the word must be a permutation of R, E, I plus two other consonants not yet ruled out.  
Good consonants left: C, D, L, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, etc.

Let’s try to place:
- N in 3  
- E must be in 1 or 4  
- I must be in 1, 2, or 5  
- R must be in 1 or 5  

Try E in 1 and R in 5:
E _ N _ R  
I must go in 2 or 4 (but 4 is open).  
If I go in 2: E I N _ R → need a consonant for 4.  
Possible consonants: C, D, L, P, M, etc.  
""EDINR"" – no, not a word.  
""ELINR"" – no.  
""EPINR"" – no.  

Try I in 2 and E in 4:

If R in 1: R I N E _ → need consonant for 5.  
Possible: R I N E C → ""RINEC"" – no.

Check constraints:
- R in 1 (allowed)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.

- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.

Letters we know are in the word: R and E.  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, O, S.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and E.
2. Does NOT contain A, O, S.
3. Places R somewhere other than position 2.
4. Places E somewhere other than position 5.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out).

Let’s try to place R and E in new positions while introducing new common letters.  
One simple word that satisfies these constraints: “UNTIE”
- U and I are new vowels.
- N and T are new consonants.
- R is in position 4 (not 2).
- E is in position 3 (not 5).

But ""INFER"" has F at 2, but F is allowed. Check:
- I N E R – but N is at 3, so pattern is I _ N E R, so position 2 must be a consonant.

Valid word: ""I N E R"" with a consonant in 2. The only common word fitting is ""INFER"" but that has F at 2. Check if F is allowed – not ruled out yet.

But ""INFER"" is I N F E R, but we have N at 3, E at 4, R at 5, and I must be at 1. So pattern is I _ N E R. Thus, ""INFER"" would be I N F E R, but N is at 3, so it would be I _ N E R, so ""INFER"" is invalid because F is at 2, but we need a consonant at 2.

Wait, the only valid word fitting I _ N E R is ""INFER"" but that would be I N F E R, which matches the pattern. Let me check if F is allowed – not ruled out yet.

But let me think of other possibilities. Maybe ""I M N E R"" – but that's not a word. ""I C N E R"" – no. ""I P N E R"" – no. ""I H N E R"" – no. ""I K N E R"" – no. ""I G N E R"" – no. ""I B N E R"" – no. ""I F N E R"" – no.

Wait, perhaps I missed a consonant. Let me list possible consonants: C, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, D (but D is out), etc.

The only valid word I can think of is ""INFER"" but that seems unlikely. Let me check if there's another word.

Wait, ""I N E R"" with a consonant at 2 – the only common word is ""INFER"" but that's not matching. Maybe ""I N E R"" is not the right path.

Wait, let me re-examine the constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ N E R
- R at 5 confirmed
- N at 3 confirmed
- E at 4 confirmed
- I must be at 1 or 2 (from previous feedback)
- From liner feedback: I cannot be at 2 (got ""-""), so I must be at 1
- Thus, pattern: I _ N E R
- Position 2 must be a consonant not yet ruled out.

Possible valid words with this pattern:
- ""I C N E R"" – no
- ""I M N E R"" – no
- ""I P N E R"" – no
- ""I H N E R"" – no
- ""I G N E R"" – no
- ""I B N E R"" – no

- ""I K N E R"" – no
- ""I V N E R"" – no
- ""I W N E R"" – no

This seems problematic. Let me check if I made an error in placing I.

Wait, from liner feedback: I(-) means I is in the word but not at position 2. It could be at 1, 3, 4, or 5. But:
- 3 is N
- 4 is E
- 5 is R
Thus, I must be at 1.

So pattern is I _ N E R. The only possible word is ""INFER"" but that's not matching the pattern. This suggests I may have missed a word.

Wait, let me think differently – perhaps the word has I at 2 but I misread the feedback.

Re-reading: liner → L(x) I(-) N(✓) E(✓) R(✓)

Thus, I must be at 1

So pattern: I _ N E R. The only valid word is ""INFER"" but that's not matching. This suggests no common word fits, but that's unlikely. Let me check ""INFER"" structure:

""INFER"" is I N F E R – positions: 1=I, 2=N, 3=F, 4=E, 5=R. But we know N is at 3, E at 4, R at 5. So ""INFER"" would be I N F E R, which matches I _ N E R with F at 2. Thus, ""INFER"" is actually I N F E R, which fits the pattern.

Thus, the next guess is ""INFER"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and common consonants. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This will help us quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

Letters we know are in the word: R and E.  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, O, S.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and E.
2. Does NOT contain A, O, S.
3. Places R somewhere other than position 2.
4. Places E somewhere other than position 5.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out).

Let’s try to place R and E in new positions while introducing new common letters.  
One simple word that satisfies these constraints: “UNTIE”
- U and I are new vowels.
- N and T are new consonants.
- R is in position 4 (not 2).
- E is in position 3 (not 5).

This should give us more information about the remaining letters and positions.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   - Letters in word: R, E  
   - Letters out: A, O, S  

2. untie → U(x) N(✓) T(x) I(-) E(-)  
   - N is now locked in position 3.  
   - R and E are still in the word but not in their previous spots.  
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.  
   - E is in the word but not in position 5 (so E must be in 1, 2, or 4).  
   - U and T are out.

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ _ N _ _ (position 3 = N)  
- Must contain: R, E, I  
- Must not contain: A, O, S, U, T  
- E cannot be in 5 (already satisfied) or 2 (because in arose it was in 5 and now must move).  
- E must be in 1 or 4.  
- I cannot be in 4 (from untie feedback), so I must be in 1, 2, or 5.  
- R cannot be in 2 (from arose) or 4 (from untie), so R must be in 1 or 5.

Let’s list possible placements:
- Position 1: E or I or R  
- Position 2: I (since E cannot be here and R is either 1 or 5)  
- Position 3: N (locked)  
- Position 4: E (since E must be in 1 or 4 and 1 is open)  
- Position 5: remaining letter (I or R)

One valid arrangement: E I N R E  
But that repeats E twice, which is impossible.

Another arrangement: R I N E E – also impossible.

Wait, we only have 5 positions and must use R, E, I once each.  
So the word must be a permutation of R, E, I plus two other consonants not yet ruled out.  
Good consonants left: C, D, L, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, etc.

Let’s try to place:
- N in 3  
- E must be in 1 or 4  
- I must be in 1, 2, or 5  
- R must be in 1 or 5  

Try E in 1 and R in 5:
E _ N _ R  
I must go in 2 or 4 (but 4 is open).  
If I go in 2: E I N _ R → need a consonant for 4.  
Possible consonants: C, D, L, P, M, etc.  
""EDINR"" – no, not a word.  
""ELINR"" – no.  
""EPINR"" – no.  

Try I in 2 and E in 4:
_ I N E _  
R must be in 1 or 5.  
If R in 1: R I N E _ → need consonant for 5.  
Possible: R I N E C → ""RINEC"" – no.  
R I N E D – ""RINED"" – valid word.  

Check constraints:
- R in 1 (allowed)  
- I in 2 (allowed)  
- N in 3 (locked)  
- E in 4 (allowed)  
- D is new and allowed.  

Thus, ""RINED"" is a valid next guess.

From the three rounds:

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Letters in word: R, E
   - Letters out: A, O, S

2. untie → U(x) N(✓) T(x) I(-) E(-)
   - N is fixed at position 3
   - I is in the word but not at position 4
   - E is in the word but not at position 5
   - U, T are out

3. rined → R(-) I(-) N(✓) E(✓) D(x)
   - N at 3 and E at 4 are confirmed
   - R is in the word but not at position 1
   - I is in the word but not at position 2
   - D is out

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ N E _ (positions 3=N, 4=E fixed)
- Letters in word: R, I, N, E (N and E already placed)
- Letters out: A, O, S, U, T, D
- R cannot be at 1 or 2 (from arose and rined feedback) → must be at 5
- I cannot be at 2 or 4 (from untie and rined feedback) → must be at 1 or 2, but 4 is already E, so I must be at 1 or 2. However, position 2 is open, so I could be at 2.

Wait, let's re-examine:
- Pattern: _ _ N E _
- R must be at 5 (since it can't be at 1 or 2)
- I must be at 1 or 2 (since it can't be at 2 or 4, and 4 is E)
- So possible:
  - I at 1: I _ N E R
  - I at 2: _ I N E R

We need a consonant for the remaining position (2 or 1 respectively) that hasn't been ruled out. Good consonants left: C, L, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, etc.

Check possible words:
- I _ N E R: possible consonants for 2: C, L, M, P, H...
  - ""ICNER"" – no
  - ""ILNER"" – no
  - ""IMNER"" – no
  - ""IPNER"" – no
  - ""IHNER"" – no
  - ""IFNER"" – no
  - ""IKNER"" – no
  - ""ICLER"" – no, etc. Doesn't seem valid.

- _ I N E R: possible consonants for 1: C, L, M, P, H...

  - ""MINER"" – valid word
  - ""PINER"" – valid word
  - ""HINER"" – not valid
  - ""GINER"" – not valid
  - ""BINER"" – not valid

Between ""LINER"", ""MINER"", ""PINER"", all are valid. Let's pick ""LINER"" as it's common.

From the four rounds:

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Letters in word: R, E
   - Letters out: A, O, S

2. untie → U(x) N(✓) T(x) I(-) E(-)

   - I in word but not at 2 or 3 (since it was at 2 in liner and got ""-"", so I cannot be at 2 or 3)
   - L is out

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ N E R (positions 3=N, 4=E, 5=R fixed)
- Letters in word: I must be at position 1 or 2 (cannot be at 2 from liner feedback, so I must be at 1)
- So pattern: I _ N E R
- Letters out: A, O, S, U, T, D, L
- Remaining position 2 must be a consonant not yet ruled out: C, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, etc.

Possible valid words:
- I C N E R – ""ICNER"" – not valid
- I M N E R – ""IMNER"" – not valid
- I P N E R – ""IPNER"" – not valid
- I H N E R – ""IHNER"" – not valid

- I K N E R – ""IKNER"" – not valid
- I C H E R – ""ICHER"" – not valid
- I M P E R – ""IMPER"" – not valid
- I N C E R – but N is at 3
- Wait, only consonants left are for position 2, and none of them seem to form valid words with I N E R.

But ""INFER"" has F at 2, but F is allowed. Check:
- I N E R – but N is at 3, so pattern is I _ N E R, so position 2 must be a consonant.

Valid word: ""I N E R"" with a consonant in 2. The only common word fitting is ""INFER"" but that has F at 2. Check if F is allowed – not ruled out yet.

But ""INFER"" is I N F E R, but we have N at 3, E at 4, R at 5, and I must be at 1. So pattern is I _ N E R. Thus, ""INFER"" would be I N F E R, but N is at 3, so it would be I _ N E R, so ""INFER"" is invalid because F is at 2, but we need a consonant at 2.

Wait, the only valid word fitting I _ N E R is ""INFER"" but that would be I N F E R, which matches the pattern. Let me check if F is allowed – not ruled out yet.

But let me think of other possibilities. Maybe ""I M N E R"" – but that's not a word. ""I C N E R"" – no. ""I P N E R"" – no. ""I H N E R"" – no. ""I K N E R"" – no. ""I G N E R"" – no. ""I B N E R"" – no. ""I F N E R"" – no.

Wait, perhaps I missed a consonant. Let me list possible consonants: C, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, D (but D is out), etc.

The only valid word I can think of is ""INFER"" but that seems unlikely. Let me check if there's another word.

Wait, ""I N E R"" with a consonant at 2 – the only common word is ""INFER"" but that's not matching. Maybe ""I N E R"" is not the right path.

Wait, let me re-examine the constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ N E R
- R at 5 confirmed
- N at 3 confirmed
- E at 4 confirmed
- I must be at 1 or 2 (from previous feedback)
- From liner feedback: I cannot be at 2 (got ""-""), so I must be at 1
- Thus, pattern: I _ N E R
- Position 2 must be a consonant not yet ruled out.

Possible valid words with this pattern:
- ""I C N E R"" – no
- ""I M N E R"" – no
- ""I P N E R"" – no
- ""I H N E R"" – no
- ""I G N E R"" – no
- ""I B N E R"" – no
- ""I F N E R"" – no
- ""I K N E R"" – no
- ""I V N E R"" – no
- ""I W N E R"" – no

This seems problematic. Let me check if I made an error in placing I.

Wait, from liner feedback: I(-) means I is in the word but not at position 2. It could be at 1, 3, 4, or 5. But:
- 3 is N
- 4 is E
- 5 is R
Thus, I must be at 1.

So pattern is I _ N E R. The only possible word is ""INFER"" but that's not matching the pattern. This suggests I may have missed a word.

Wait, let me think differently – perhaps the word has I at 2 but I misread the feedback.

Re-reading: liner → L(x) I(-) N(✓) E(✓) R(✓)
- I(-) means I is in the word but not at position 2
Thus, I could be at 1, 3, 4, or 5
But:
- 3 is N
- 4 is E
- 5 is R
Thus, I must be at 1

So pattern: I _ N E R. The only valid word is ""INFER"" but that's not matching. This suggests no common word fits, but that's unlikely. Let me check ""INFER"" structure:

""INFER"" is I N F E R – positions: 1=I, 2=N, 3=F, 4=E, 5=R. But we know N is at 3, E at 4, R at 5. So ""INFER"" would be I N F E R, which matches I _ N E R with F at 2. Thus, ""INFER"" is actually I N F E R, which fits the pattern.

Thus, the next guess is ""INFER"".From the feedback:
- N is at position 3
- E is at position 4
- R is at position 5
- I must be at position 1 (since it can't be at 2,3,4,5 and 3,4,5 are taken)
- The only remaining position is 2, which must be a consonant not yet ruled out.

The only valid word fitting I _ N E R is ""INFER"".

This suggests I may have missed a word.\n\nWait, let me think differently – perhaps the word has I at 2 but I misread the feedback.\n\nRe-reading: liner → L(x) I(-) N(✓) E(✓) R(✓)\n- I(-) means I is in the word but not at position 2\nThus, I could be at 1, 3, 4, or 5\nBut:\n- 3 is N\n- 4 is E\n- 5 is R\nThus, I must be at 1\n\nSo pattern: I _ N E R. The only valid word is ""INFER"" but that\'s not matching. This suggests no common word fits, but that\'s unlikely. Let me check ""INFER"" structure:\n\n""INFER"" is I N F E R – positions: 1=I, 2=N, 3=F, 4=E, 5=R. But we know N is at 3, E at 4, R at 5. So ""INFER"" would be I N F E R, which matches I _ N E R with F at 2. Thus, ""INFER"" is actually I N F E R, which fits the pattern.\n\nThus, the next guess is ""INFER"".From the feedback:\n- N is at position 3\n- E is at position 4\n- R is at position 5\n- I must be at position 1 (since it can\'t be at 2,3,4,5 and 3,4,5 are taken)\n- The only remaining position is 2, which must be a consonant not yet ruled out.\n\nThe only valid word fitting I _ N E R is ""INFER"".\n\n<guess>infer</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: untie -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(✓) T(x) I(-) E(-)\nGuess 3: rined -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(-) N(✓) E(✓) D(x)\nGuess 4: liner -> FEEDBACK: L(x) I(-) N(✓) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 5: infer -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) N(✓) F(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
All positions are now fixed except for the letter in position 2.  
We know:

- Position 1 = I  
- Position 2 = ? (must be a consonant not yet ruled out)  
- Position 3 = N  
- Position 4 = E  
- Position 5 = R  

Letters already eliminated: A, O, S, U, T, D, L, F  
Remaining common consonants for position 2: C, M, P, H, G, B, K, Y, W, V …

The only common 5-letter word that fits the pattern I _ N E R and uses an allowed consonant in position 2 is:

I N C E R  →  “IN CER”  →  “INFER” is already tried; the correct word is actually “IN CER” but that is not valid.  
Wait—let’s list the valid dictionary word: “INFER” is already tried. The only real word left is “IN CER” which does not exist.  

Recheck: valid English words that are I _ N E R.  
The only valid word is “INFER”, but F is eliminated.  
Next possibility: “IMNER” – invalid.  
“IPNER” – invalid.  
“IGNER” – invalid.  
“IKNER” – invalid.  
“INHER” – H is allowed and “INHER” is a valid word (variant spelling of “inher” meaning “in her”).

Thus, “INHER” is the only remaining valid word.
