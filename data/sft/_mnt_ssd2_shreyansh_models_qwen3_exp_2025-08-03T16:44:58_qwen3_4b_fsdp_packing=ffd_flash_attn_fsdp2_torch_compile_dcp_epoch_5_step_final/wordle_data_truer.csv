### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no information about the secret word, I should choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us coverage of 5 different letters that appear frequently in English words, which will help narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no information about the secret word, I should choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us coverage of 5 different letters that appear frequently in English words, which will help narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → R is the second letter
- O: not in word (x)
- S: not in word (x)
- E: in word but wrong position (-) → E is somewhere else (not 5th)

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Letters to keep: R (fixed in 2nd)
- Letters to use: E somewhere else (not 5th), and avoid A, O, S

Good next step: pick a word that keeps R in 2nd, uses E in a different position, and introduces new common consonants.  
Possible candidates: ""TREND"", ""CREPE"", ""BROKE"" (but O is out), ""FRESH"" (but S is out), ""DREAD"" (but A is out), ""GRIME"" (but M/I are less common), ""TREND"" seems good: T, R, E, N, D.

""TREND"" uses:
- T: new common consonant
- R: fixed in 2nd
- E: in word but not in 5th (will test in 3rd)
- N, D: new common consonants

From the two guesses we have:

   - A, O, S are not in the word.

2. trend → T(✓) R(✓) E(-) N(x) D(x)
   - T is fixed in position 1.
   - R is still fixed in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 3 or 5 (from trend feedback E is in word but wrong position, and in arose it was not in 5, so now we know E must be in position 4).
   - N and D are not in the word.

Current knowledge:
- Pattern: T R _ E _
- Letters to use: E must be in position 4.
- Letters to avoid: A, O, S, N, D.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with TR, has E in the 4th position, and uses only letters we haven't ruled out. Remaining common consonants include B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

- TREND (but N is out)
- TRODE (but O is out)
- TRICE
- TRUGE (not valid)
- TRAPE (but A is out)

Valid options: TRIBE, TRIKE, TRIPE, TRICE.

Among these, ""TRICE"" uses C and E in positions 3 and 4 respectively, and avoids all ruled-out letters. Let's try TRICE.

TRICE:

   - A, O, S are out.

2. trend → T(✓) R(✓) E(-) N(x) D(x)
   - T is fixed in position 1.

   - E is still marked “wrong position” in position 5, but we already know it must be in position 4, so this is consistent.
   - P is out.

So the pattern is now: T R U E _

We need a 5-letter word that starts with T R U E and uses only letters not yet ruled out. The last letter must be something we haven’t tried yet and isn’t P, A, O, S, N, D, I, C.

Looking at the alphabet, letters left for the last position include: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, Y.

Possible valid words:
- T R U E B → “trueb” (not a word)
- T R U E K → “truek” (not a word)
- T R U E M → “truem” (not a word)
- T R U E F → “truef” (not a word)
- T R U E G → “trueg” (not a word)
- T R U E H → “trueh” (not a word)
- T R U E L → “truel” (not a word)
- T R U E Y → “truey” (not a word)

Wait, the only actual English word that starts with T R U E is “TRUTH”, but we already used T, R, U, E, and the last letter would be H. Let’s check if H has been ruled out.

Looking back at used letters:
- Ruled out: A, O, S, N, D, I, C, P
- H has not appeared yet, so it’s still allowed.

Thus, the only valid word left is TRUTH.

Let’s test it.

TRUTH:
- T(✓) position 1
- R(✓) position 2
- U(✓) position 3
- T: already used, but TRUTH is a valid word.
- H: new letter, not ruled out.

This fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no information about the secret word, I should choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This gives us coverage of 5 different letters that appear frequently in English words, which will help narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) → R is the second letter
- O: not in word (x)
- S: not in word (x)
- E: in word but wrong position (-) → E is somewhere else (not 5th)

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Letters to keep: R (fixed in 2nd)
- Letters to use: E somewhere else (not 5th), and avoid A, O, S

Good next step: pick a word that keeps R in 2nd, uses E in a different position, and introduces new common consonants.  
Possible candidates: ""TREND"", ""CREPE"", ""BROKE"" (but O is out), ""FRESH"" (but S is out), ""DREAD"" (but A is out), ""GRIME"" (but M/I are less common), ""TREND"" seems good: T, R, E, N, D.

""TREND"" uses:
- T: new common consonant
- R: fixed in 2nd
- E: in word but not in 5th (will test in 3rd)
- N, D: new common consonants

From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - R is fixed in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - A, O, S are not in the word.

2. trend → T(✓) R(✓) E(-) N(x) D(x)
   - T is fixed in position 1.
   - R is still fixed in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 3 or 5 (from trend feedback E is in word but wrong position, and in arose it was not in 5, so now we know E must be in position 4).
   - N and D are not in the word.

Current knowledge:
- Pattern: T R _ E _
- Letters to use: E must be in position 4.
- Letters to avoid: A, O, S, N, D.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with TR, has E in the 4th position, and uses only letters we haven't ruled out. Remaining common consonants include B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for words matching T R _ E _:
- TRIBE
- TRIKE
- TRIPE
- TREND (but N is out)
- TRODE (but O is out)
- TRICE
- TRUGE (not valid)
- TRAPE (but A is out)

Valid options: TRIBE, TRIKE, TRIPE, TRICE.

Among these, ""TRICE"" uses C and E in positions 3 and 4 respectively, and avoids all ruled-out letters. Let's try TRICE.

TRICE:
- T(✓) in position 1
- R(✓) in position 2
- I: new letter, not ruled out
- C: new letter, not ruled out
- E(✓) in position 4

From all feedback so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - R is fixed in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (because it was “wrong position” in each of those places).
   - A, O, S are out.

2. trend → T(✓) R(✓) E(-) N(x) D(x)
   - T is fixed in position 1.
   - R is still in position 2.
   - E must be in position 4 (since it can’t be 1, 3, or 5 and 2 is taken by R).
   - N, D are out.

3. trice → T(✓) R(✓) I(x) C(x) E(-)
   - T and R confirmed in positions 1 and 2.
   - E confirmed in position 4.
   - I and C are not in the word.

Current pattern: T R _ E _

Letters still allowed: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc. (avoiding A, O, S, N, D, I, C).

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with TR, has E in the 4th spot, and uses only allowed letters. Possible words:

- TRIBE (B allowed)
- TRIPE (P allowed)
- TRUPE (U allowed)
- TRUM (not a word)
- TRUG (not a word)
- TRUM (invalid)
- TRUL (invalid)

The only valid common word among these is TRIBE. Let’s try it.

TRIBE:
- T(✓) position 1
- R(✓) position 2
- I: but I was already ruled out in guess 3.
Oops, TRIBE has I, which is invalid.

Next candidate: TRIPE.
- T(✓) position 1
- R(✓) position 2
- P: allowed
- I: ruled out (invalid)

Hmm, no valid common word seems to fit. Let’s reconsider: maybe we missed an allowed letter combination.

Wait, we have T R _ E _. The blank must be a letter not yet ruled out. Allowed consonants left: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y.

Possible valid words:
- TRIBE (invalid, has I)
- TRIPE (invalid, has I)
- TRUPE (invalid, has U but U is allowed, but is it a word? Yes, slang for “trouble”)
- TRUG (invalid)
- TRUM (invalid)

Actually, TRUPE is valid but uses U, which hasn’t been ruled out. Let’s try TRUPE.

TRUPE:
- T(✓) position 1
- R(✓) position 2
- U: allowed
- P: allowed
- E(✓) position 4

This fits all constraints.

   - E is still marked “wrong position” in position 5, but we already know it must be in position 4, so this is consistent.
   - P is out.

So the pattern is now: T R U E _

We need a 5-letter word that starts with T R U E and uses only letters not yet ruled out. The last letter must be something we haven’t tried yet and isn’t P, A, O, S, N, D, I, C.

- T R U E H → “trueh” (not a word)
- T R U E L → “truel” (not a word)
- T R U E Y → “truey” (not a word)

Wait, the only actual English word that starts with T R U E is “TRUTH”, but we already used T, R, U, E, and the last letter would be H. Let’s check if H has been ruled out.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. Positions already fixed:
   - Position 1: T ✓
   - Position 2: R ✓
   - Position 3: U ✓

2. Letters we have discovered are in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
   - E: has been marked “wrong position” in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.  
     Since positions 1, 2, 3 are already occupied by T, R, U, the only remaining spot for E is position 4.

3. Letters definitely NOT in the word:
   A, O, S, N, D, I, C, P, H

Therefore the pattern is:
T R U E _

We need a single letter for the last position that:
- has never appeared yet,
- is not in the forbidden set above.

Looking at the alphabet, unused letters include: B, F, G, K, L, M, V, W, Y.

Among these, the only common English word that fits T R U E _ is:

T R U E L  →  “TRUEL”  (a variant spelling or slang of “truly”, but not a standard word).

However, the standard word list contains exactly one valid 5-letter word matching this pattern:  T R U E L  is not valid, but  T R U E  +  L  does not form a recognized word.

Wait – let’s double-check the standard dictionary.  
The only recognized English word that starts with TRU is “TRULY”.  That would require the pattern T R U L Y, which doesn’t fit our fixed positions.

Realizing that we may have made an error:  the feedback for Guess 5 (truth) shows:
T(✓) R(✓) U(✓) T(-) H(x)

The second T is marked “wrong position” (–), which means:
- There is another T somewhere in the word, but NOT in position 4 (since T is already fixed in position 1 and cannot appear twice).

This is a critical insight.  The word must contain a second T somewhere, but position 4 is already taken by E (as per earlier deduction).  Therefore the second T must be in position 5.

Hence the pattern becomes:
T R U E T

We need to verify that this forms a valid word.  The resulting string is “TRUET”, which is not a recognized English word.

Realizing the only possible resolution is that we misinterpreted the feedback.  Re-reading carefully:

Guess 5: truth → T(✓) R(✓) U(✓) T(-) H(x)

- T in position 1: ✓ (correct)
- R in position 2: ✓ (correct)
- U in position 3: ✓ (correct)
- T in position 4: – (in word but wrong position)  
  This implies there is a T in the word, but it is not in position 4.  Since T is already in position 1, this second T must be in position 5.
- H in position 5: x (not in word)

Thus the word must be T R U E T, but this is not valid.

This contradiction indicates an earlier misstep.  Re-evaluating:

From Guess 4 (trupe → T(✓) R(✓) U(✓) P(x) E(-)):
- We concluded E must be in position 4, because it was marked “wrong position” in 5 and we had no other placements.

But “wrong position” only rules out the specific positions tested.  It does not necessarily fix E to position 4; it just means E is not in 1,3,4,5 (from arose and trupe) and not in 5 (from truth).  The only remaining possible positions for E are 2 or 3, but these are already taken by R and U.  Therefore E cannot be placed anywhere, which is impossible.

This reveals our earlier deduction was flawed.  The feedback for E is cumulative:

- arose: E(-)  → not in 1,3,4,5
- trupe: E(-)  → not in 5
- truth: T(-)  → second T exists but not in 4

Actually, the only letter whose position is now fixed is the second T, which must be in position 5.  Therefore the word ends with T.

From the remaining letters, the only valid word that fits is:

T R U E T  →  “TRUET”  (not valid)

Realizing the only standard word that fits is “TRULY”, which would require:

T R U L Y

But this contradicts our fixed positions.

At this point, the only remaining possibility is that the word is “TRULY” and we misread the feedback.  However, the feedback for “TRULY” would be:

T(✓) R(✓) U(✓) L(x) Y(x)

which does not match the given feedback.

Reconstructing:

We have:

Positions:
1: T ✓
2: R ✓
3: U ✓
5: T ✓ (from second T in truth feedback)

Thus the word must be T R U _ T.

The only letter that fits is L, giving “TRULT”, which is invalid.

Realizing the only valid word matching T R U _ T is “TRUST”.

Let’s verify:

TRUST:

1: T ✓
2: R ✓
3: U ✓
4: S (not yet ruled out)
5: T ✓ (matches second T)

All letters used are allowed (S not in forbidden set).

Therefore the correct next guess is TRUST.
</think>

From the latest feedback, we know:
- The word starts with T R U _ T (positions 1,2,3,5 are fixed as T, R, U, T).
- The missing letter (position 4) must be one we haven’t ruled out.

The only remaining common letter that fits and forms a valid word is S.
