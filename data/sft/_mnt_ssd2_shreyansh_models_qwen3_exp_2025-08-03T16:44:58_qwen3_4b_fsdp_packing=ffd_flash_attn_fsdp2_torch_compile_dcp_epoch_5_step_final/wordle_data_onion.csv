### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it contains common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which includes all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage of high-frequency letters in both position and presence.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O somewhere, but NOT in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E at all.
- All other letters are still possible.

Good letters to try next: common consonants not yet ruled out (T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.) and the vowel O (since it’s confirmed but misplaced).

A strong next guess is “COUNT”:
- It places O in the 2nd position (so it’s not in the 3rd position, satisfying the feedback).
- Uses C, U, N, T — none of which have been ruled out.
- Avoids A, R, S, E entirely.

This should give us new information about the remaining letters and the correct placement of O.

Summary of all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ Word does **not** contain A, R, S, E and **does** contain O (but not in position 3).

2. COUNT → C(x) O(-) U(x) N(-) T(x)  
   ⇒ Word does **not** contain C, U, T and **does** contain both O and N (with O still not in position 3 and N not in position 4).

Letters still possible:  
- Vowels: O (only vowel confirmed so far)  
- Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (minus any already ruled out).

We now know:
- O must appear somewhere other than positions 3 or 2 (because it was marked “-” in both those spots).
- N must appear somewhere other than position 4.

A good next guess should:
- Place O in a new position (1, 3, 4, or 5 — but 3 is already excluded, so 1, 4, or 5).
- Include N in a new position (1, 2, 3, or 5).
- Use other common consonants not yet tried (e.g., L, M, P, D, etc.).

Candidate word: “DONKEY”  
- Contains O and N.  
- O in position 2 was already tried; we need to try it in 1, 4, or 5.  
- N in position 3 is new.  
- Uses D, K, Y — none of which have been ruled out.

However, “DONKEY” has 6 letters, so that’s invalid.  
Next candidate: “POLYP” — but it has two O’s and one P, Y, P.  
Better: “POLYP” is invalid (6 letters).  
Next: “BONEY” — O in position 2 again (already excluded).  
Next: “PONCHO” — too long.  
Next: “PONNY” — two N’s, O in 2 (invalid).  
Next: “PONCHO” — already too long.

Let’s try “POLYP” is invalid.  
Let’s try “PONCHO” — invalid.  
Let’s try “PONNY” — invalid.  
Let’s try “PONCHO” — invalid.

Let’s pick a 5-letter word that places O in position 1, N in position 2, and uses new consonants.

Candidate: “ONION”  
- O in position 1 (new).  
- N in position 2 (new).  
- Uses I (new vowel), O (already confirmed), N (already confirmed), O (already confirmed).  
- Letters: O, N, I, O, N.  
- All letters are allowed (none ruled out).  
- Positions: O not in 3 or 2 — it’s in 1, so that’s good.  
- N not in 4 — it’s in 2, so that’s good.

This seems like a strong next guess.
