For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should cover several of these.

""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us coverage of 5 of the most frequent letters and can help quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word.

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter O, but O cannot be in position 3.
2. The letters A, R, S, E are NOT in the word.
3. Therefore, the remaining possible consonants are among: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding S and R).
4. The remaining possible vowels are: I, U (since A, E are out and O is confirmed somewhere else).

A good second guess should:
- Include O in a different position (not 3).
- Use new common consonants and vowels.
- Avoid A, R, S, E.

Possible candidates: 
- ""POINT"" – uses O, P, I, N, T.
- ""CLOUD"" – uses O, U, L, D.
- ""MOUTH"" – uses O, U, T, H.

- Letters still available (not yet eliminated): B, C, D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- L must appear somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.

We need three more letters from the remaining pool to fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5, ensuring L is used once and no eliminated letters are included.

A good next guess should:
- Place L in a new position (3, 4, or 5).
- Use common remaining consonants and the remaining vowel (none left except possibly Y as vowel, but we have no I/U/E/A already used).
- Try to cover new common letters quickly.

Candidate words:
- ""CLOWN"" – uses C, L, O, W, N; N is eliminated ⇒ invalid.
- ""BLOOM"" – uses B, L, O, O, M; M and O already handled, but M is eliminated ⇒ invalid.
- ""FOLLY"" – uses F, O, L, L, Y; L is allowed twice, but we don't know if double letters are possible ⇒ risky.

""POLYP"" seems valid:
- P, O, L, Y, P – all letters are still possible (P not eliminated, Y not eliminated, L must appear).
- It places L in position 3, satisfying the ""- in position 1"" from login.

However, POLYP has P twice, which may or may not be the case. A safer choice is ""CLOPS"", but S is eliminated. Next is ""FOLLY"" – but we don't know if double L is allowed.

Best safe choice: ""CLOPS"" is invalid (S eliminated). ""CLOAK"" – uses C, L, O, A, K; A is eliminated ⇒ invalid.

LOWLY has L in 1 and 4 – but L cannot be in 1 (from login), so LOWLY is invalid.

Best next guess: ""CLOPS"" is invalid (S eliminated). ""CLOAK"" invalid (A eliminated). ""CLOWN"" invalid (N eliminated). ""FOLLY"" is possible – but double L is uncertain.

Actually, let's think differently: we need _ O _ _ _ with L somewhere and no eliminated letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should cover several of these.

""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us coverage of 5 of the most frequent letters and can help quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter O, but O cannot be in position 3.
2. The letters A, R, S, E are NOT in the word.
3. Therefore, the remaining possible consonants are among: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding S and R).
4. The remaining possible vowels are: I, U (since A, E are out and O is confirmed somewhere else).

A good second guess should:
- Include O in a different position (not 3).
- Use new common consonants and vowels.
- Avoid A, R, S, E.

Possible candidates: 
- ""POINT"" – uses O, P, I, N, T.
- ""CLOUD"" – uses O, U, L, D.
- ""MOUTH"" – uses O, U, T, H.

I'll choose ""MOUTH"" because it uses O in position 2, and includes common consonants M, T, H and the vowel U.

Guess 2: mouth -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) U(x) T(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current knowledge:
- Letters known to be in the word: O (and it is in position 2).
- Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, M, U, T, H.

So the secret word looks like:
_ O _ _ _

Letters still available (from the alphabet excluding the eliminated ones):
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: I (since A, E, U, O are already handled)

We need three more letters to fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5, and they must be from the remaining pool. A good strategy is to pick common remaining consonants and the vowel I.

Possible patterns:
- C O _ _ _
- L O _ _ _
- N O _ _ _
- P O _ _ _
- etc.

Let's try ""CLOUD"" – but U is already eliminated. So that's out.
""POINT"" – uses I, N, T, but T is eliminated. Out.
""FOLLY"" – uses L, Y, but double L might be unlikely. Not ideal.
""COULD"" – uses U, eliminated. Out.
""LOGIN"" – uses L, G, I, N. All these letters are still possible.

""LOGIN"" seems good: it places O in position 2, uses common remaining consonants L, G, N and the vowel I.

Check elimination status:
L – not eliminated
O – confirmed in position 2
G – not eliminated
I – not eliminated
N – not eliminated

This is a valid guess.

We must use Y exactly once, so either:
- Y in position 1: Y O L _ _  
- Y in position 4: _ O L Y _

Let's list valid English words fitting _ O L _ _ with Y in 1 or 4, and no eliminated letters:

- Y O L _ _ : ""YOLLY"" (double Y unlikely, but ""YOLLY"" is a valid word, though rare)  
- _ O L Y _ : ""BOLLY"" – not standard; ""COLLY"" – not standard; ""DOLLY"" – valid; ""FOLLY"" – valid; ""JOLLY"" – valid; ""KOLLY"" – not standard.

""DOLLY"" and ""FOLLY"" and ""JOLLY"" are all valid 5-letter words.

Check constraints:

  Letters used: D, O, L, L, Y – all allowed so far.

""FOLLY"": F, O, L, L, Y – same.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should cover several of these.

""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us coverage of 5 of the most frequent letters and can help quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter O, but O cannot be in position 3.
2. The letters A, R, S, E are NOT in the word.
3. Therefore, the remaining possible consonants are among: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding S and R).
4. The remaining possible vowels are: I, U (since A, E are out and O is confirmed somewhere else).

A good second guess should:
- Include O in a different position (not 3).
- Use new common consonants and vowels.
- Avoid A, R, S, E.

Possible candidates: 
- ""POINT"" – uses O, P, I, N, T.
- ""CLOUD"" – uses O, U, L, D.
- ""MOUTH"" – uses O, U, T, H.

I'll choose ""MOUTH"" because it uses O in position 2, and includes common consonants M, T, H and the vowel U.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: mouth -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) U(x) T(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current knowledge:
- Letters known to be in the word: O (and it is in position 2).
- Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, M, U, T, H.

So the secret word looks like:
_ O _ _ _

Letters still available (from the alphabet excluding the eliminated ones):
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: I (since A, E, U, O are already handled)

We need three more letters to fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5, and they must be from the remaining pool. A good strategy is to pick common remaining consonants and the vowel I.

Possible patterns:
- C O _ _ _
- L O _ _ _
- N O _ _ _
- P O _ _ _
- etc.

Let's try ""CLOUD"" – but U is already eliminated. So that's out.
""POINT"" – uses I, N, T, but T is eliminated. Out.
""FOLLY"" – uses L, Y, but double L might be unlikely. Not ideal.
""COULD"" – uses U, eliminated. Out.
""LOGIN"" – uses L, G, I, N. All these letters are still possible.

""LOGIN"" seems good: it places O in position 2, uses common remaining consonants L, G, N and the vowel I.

Check elimination status:
L – not eliminated
O – confirmed in position 2
G – not eliminated
I – not eliminated
N – not eliminated

This is a valid guess.

From all feedback so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)

   ⇒ O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. mouth → M(x) O(✓) U(x) T(x) H(x)  
   ⇒ Eliminated: M, U, T, H  
   ⇒ O is in position 2 (✓).

3. login → L(-) O(✓) G(x) I(x) N(x)  
   ⇒ Eliminated: G, I, N  
   ⇒ L is in the word but not in position 1.

Summary of constraints:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ _
- Letters still available (not yet eliminated): B, C, D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- L must appear somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.

We need three more letters from the remaining pool to fill positions 1, 3, 4, 5, ensuring L is used once and no eliminated letters are included.

A good next guess should:
- Place L in a new position (3, 4, or 5).
- Use common remaining consonants and the remaining vowel (none left except possibly Y as vowel, but we have no I/U/E/A already used).
- Try to cover new common letters quickly.

Candidate words:
- ""CLOWN"" – uses C, L, O, W, N; N is eliminated ⇒ invalid.
- ""BLOOM"" – uses B, L, O, O, M; M and O already handled, but M is eliminated ⇒ invalid.
- ""FOLLY"" – uses F, O, L, L, Y; L is allowed twice, but we don't know if double letters are possible ⇒ risky.
- ""POLYP"" – uses P, O, L, Y, P; P and Y are still possible ⇒ reasonable.
- ""CLOPS"" – uses C, L, O, P, S; S is eliminated ⇒ invalid.
- ""VOCAL"" – uses V, O, C, A, L; A is eliminated ⇒ invalid.

""POLYP"" seems valid:
- P, O, L, Y, P – all letters are still possible (P not eliminated, Y not eliminated, L must appear).
- It places L in position 3, satisfying the ""- in position 1"" from login.

However, POLYP has P twice, which may or may not be the case. A safer choice is ""CLOPS"", but S is eliminated. Next is ""FOLLY"" – but we don't know if double L is allowed.

Best safe choice: ""CLOPS"" is invalid (S eliminated). ""CLOAK"" – uses C, L, O, A, K; A is eliminated ⇒ invalid.

Next candidate: ""LOWLY"" – uses L, O, W, L, Y; L appears twice, W and Y are possible ⇒ but LOWLY is a valid word and covers new letters W and Y.

But LOWLY has L in positions 1 and 4, but O is in position 2, so pattern is L O W L Y – but this would have O in position 2 (✓), L in position 1 (but login said L is not in position 1), so L must be in 3,4, or 5.

LOWLY has L in 1 and 4 – but L cannot be in 1 (from login), so LOWLY is invalid.

Best next guess: ""CLOPS"" is invalid (S eliminated). ""CLOAK"" invalid (A eliminated). ""CLOWN"" invalid (N eliminated). ""FOLLY"" is possible – but double L is uncertain.

Actually, let's think differently: we need _ O _ _ _ with L somewhere and no eliminated letters.

Remaining letters: B, C, D, F, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We know L must be in 3,4, or 5. Let's try placing L in 3: _ O L _ _

Possible: B O L L Y – but double L uncertain. C O L L Y – same. F O L L Y – same.

Better: try L in 4: _ O _ L _

Possible: C O W L Y – but C,O,W,L,Y – all allowed. C O W L Y is a valid word? Not common.

Better: ""CLOWN"" – N is eliminated. ""BOWLY"" – not a word.

""BOLTY"" – not a word.

""POLYP"" – P, O, L, Y, P – valid word, covers P and Y.

""POLYP"" is valid and uses L in position 3, satisfying all constraints.

So final choice: POLYP.

From every guess so far we now know:

- Pattern: _ O L L Y  
  (O in position 2, L in position 3, L in position 4, Y in position 5 are all locked.)

- Only the first letter is still unknown.  
  Letters already eliminated (and therefore forbidden in position 1):  
  A, D, E, G, H, I, M, N, P, R, S, T, U.

  Remaining consonants that can still appear once are:  
  B, C, F, J, K, V, W, X, Z.

  Of these, the only common English 5-letter words that fit are:

  B O L L Y → “BOLLY”  (valid, though “bolly” is informal)  
  C O L L Y → “COLLY”  (valid, though rare)  
  F O L L Y → “FOLLY”  (common word meaning “foolishness”)  
  J O L L Y → “JOLLY”  (common word meaning “cheerful”)  
  K O L L Y → “KOLLY”  (rare or non-word)

The most natural, everyday word among these is “FOLLY”.  
We have no reason to prefer any other first letter, so “FOLLY” is the logical next and (given the pattern) final guess.
