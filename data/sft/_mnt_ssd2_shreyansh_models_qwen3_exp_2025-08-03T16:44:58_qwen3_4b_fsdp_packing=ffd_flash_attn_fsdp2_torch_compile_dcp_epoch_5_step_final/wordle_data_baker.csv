### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the amount of information gained. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give us good coverage of common letters to narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- T: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The secret word contains A and E, but not S, L, or T.
- Neither A nor E is in the 3rd or 5th position respectively.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and E (since both were marked “-”).
2. Does NOT contain S, L, or T.
3. Puts A and E in positions other than 3 or 5 respectively.

A good follow-up word should use other common letters to gain more information. I’ll pick a word that reuses the known letters A and E in new positions and introduces other high-frequency letters like R, N, I, O, etc.

I’ll try “REACT”:
- R (new letter)
- E (known, but now in position 2 instead of 5)
- A (known, now in position 3 — but wait, feedback said A is NOT in position 3, so this is bad)

Let me rethink:
- A cannot be in position 3.
- E cannot be in position 5.

From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
   - Letters not in the word: S, L, T
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: A, E

2. EAGER → E(-) A(✓) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - Letters not in the word: G
   - Letters in the word and in the correct position: A (position 2), E (position 4), R (position 5)

So we now know:
- The word has the pattern: _ A _ E R
- The letters not in the word are: S, L, T, G
- We still need to determine positions 1 and 3.

Letters that could be in position 1 or 3 (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

To maximize information, we should pick a word that:
- Fits the pattern _ A _ E R
- Uses new letters for positions 1 and 3 to test as many possibilities as possible.

A good candidate is ""C A R E R"" but ""CARE R"" isn't a valid word. Another is ""F A R E R"" - ""FARER"" is valid.

""FARER"":
- Position 1: F (new letter)
- Position 3: R (but we already know R is in position 5, so this might not be optimal)

Instead, let's try ""M A R E R"" - ""MARE R"" isn't valid. ""B A R E R"" - ""BARER"" is valid.

""BARER"":
- Position 1: B (new)
- Position 3: R (but R is already in position 5)

Better choice: ""D A R E R"" - ""DARER"" is valid.

""DARER"":
- Position 1: D (new)
- Position 3: R (again R)

Hmm, seems R is repeating. Let's try ""H A R E R"" - ""HARER"" is valid.

""HARER"":
- Position 1: H (new)
- Position 3: R (still R)

This isn't efficient. Let's think differently - we need to test new letters for positions 1 and 3 without repeating R.

Valid words fitting _ A _ E R:
- ""C A R E R"" - invalid
- ""F A R E R"" - invalid
- ""B A N E R"" - ""BANER"" isn't valid
- ""C A N E R"" - ""CANER"" is valid.

""CANER"":
- Position 1: C (new)
- Position 3: N (new)

This seems optimal - tests C and N in the two unknown positions.

Thus, the next guess is ""CANER"".

Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the amount of information gained. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give us good coverage of common letters to narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- T: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The secret word contains A and E, but not S, L, or T.
- Neither A nor E is in the 3rd or 5th position respectively.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and E (since both were marked “-”).
2. Does NOT contain S, L, or T.
3. Puts A and E in positions other than 3 or 5 respectively.

A good follow-up word should use other common letters to gain more information. I’ll pick a word that reuses the known letters A and E in new positions and introduces other high-frequency letters like R, N, I, O, etc.

I’ll try “REACT”:
- R (new letter)
- E (known, but now in position 2 instead of 5)
- A (known, now in position 3 — but wait, feedback said A is NOT in position 3, so this is bad)

Let me rethink:
- A cannot be in position 3.
- E cannot be in position 5.

I’ll try “CRANE”:
- C (new)
- R (new)
- A (known, in position 3 — again invalid)

“AROSE”:
- A in position 1 (valid)
- R (new)
- O (new)
- S (invalid, already ruled out)
- E in position 5 (invalid)

“RAISE”:
- R (new)
- A in position 2 (valid)
- I (new)
- S (invalid)
- E in position 5 (invalid)

“EARLY”:
- E in position 1 (valid)
- A in position 2 (valid)
- R (new)
- L (invalid)
- Y (new)

“EARTH”:
- E in position 1 (valid)
- A in position 2 (valid)
- R (new)
- T (invalid)
- H (new)

“EAGER”:
- E in position 1 (valid)
- A in position 2 (valid)
- G (new)
- E in position 4 (valid)
- R (new)

This seems good:
- Contains A (position 2) and E (positions 1 and 4).
- Does not contain S, L, or T.
- Uses new letters G and R to gain info.

I’ll go with “EAGER”.

Guess 2: EAGER -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(✓) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)

From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
   - Letters not in the word: S, L, T
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: A, E

2. EAGER → E(-) A(✓) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - Letters not in the word: G
   - Letters in the word and in the correct position: A (position 2), E (position 4), R (position 5)

So we now know:
- The word has the pattern: _ A _ E R
- The letters not in the word are: S, L, T, G
- We still need to determine positions 1 and 3.

Letters that could be in position 1 or 3 (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

To maximize information, we should pick a word that:
- Fits the pattern _ A _ E R
- Uses new letters for positions 1 and 3 to test as many possibilities as possible.

A good candidate is ""C A R E R"" but ""CARE R"" isn't a valid word. Another is ""F A R E R"" - ""FARER"" is valid.

""FARER"":
- Position 1: F (new letter)
- Position 3: R (but we already know R is in position 5, so this might not be optimal)

Instead, let's try ""M A R E R"" - ""MARE R"" isn't valid. ""B A R E R"" - ""BARER"" is valid.

""BARER"":
- Position 1: B (new)
- Position 3: R (but R is already in position 5)

Better choice: ""D A R E R"" - ""DARER"" is valid.

""DARER"":
- Position 1: D (new)
- Position 3: R (again R)

Hmm, seems R is repeating. Let's try ""H A R E R"" - ""HARER"" is valid.

""HARER"":
- Position 1: H (new)
- Position 3: R (still R)

This isn't efficient. Let's think differently - we need to test new letters for positions 1 and 3 without repeating R.

Valid words fitting _ A _ E R:
- ""C A R E R"" - invalid
- ""F A R E R"" - invalid
- ""B A N E R"" - ""BANER"" isn't valid
- ""C A N E R"" - ""CANER"" is valid.

""CANER"":
- Position 1: C (new)
- Position 3: N (new)

This seems optimal - tests C and N in the two unknown positions.

Thus, the next guess is ""CANER"".

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits _ A _ E R and uses two of these remaining letters.

Looking for valid words:
- B A D E R → ""BADER"" - not a valid word
- B A M E R → ""BAMER"" - not valid
- D A M E R → ""DAMER"" - not valid
- F A M E R → ""FAMER"" - valid
- H A M E R → ""HAMER"" - valid
- M A D E R → ""MADER"" - not valid
- M A P E R → ""MAPER"" - not valid
- P A D E R → ""PADER"" - not valid
- P A M E R → ""PAMER"" - not valid
- F A M E R and H A M E R are both valid.

Between these, ""FAMER"" and ""HAMER"", both fit. ""FAMER"" is more common, so we'll test it first.

""FAMER"":
- Position 1: F (new)
- Position 3: M (new)
This tests F and M in the two unknown positions.

We now know the pattern is _ A _ E R and the letters NOT in the word are:
S, L, T, G, C, N, F, M

Remaining candidate letters for positions 1 and 3 (from the alphabet excluding the eliminated ones):
B, D, H, I, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for valid English 5-letter words fitting _ A _ E R:
- B A K E R → ""BAKER"" – valid
- D H E R – not a word
- H A O E R – not a word
- P A P E R – but P is allowed and not eliminated yet
- V A R E R – but V is allowed and not eliminated yet

However, ""BAKER"" uses B and K, both still possible. ""PAPER"" uses P (possible). ""VARE R"" is invalid.

Among these, ""BAKER"" is a common word and tests two new letters (B and K). So it's the best next guess.
