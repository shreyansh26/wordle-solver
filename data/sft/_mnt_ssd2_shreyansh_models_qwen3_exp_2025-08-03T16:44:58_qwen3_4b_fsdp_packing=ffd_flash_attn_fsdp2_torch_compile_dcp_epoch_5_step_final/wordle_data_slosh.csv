### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Words with frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, O, I, and C are good choices. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common ending letter

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters in English words.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word and in the correct first position (✓)
- L is in the word and in the correct second position (✓)
- A, T, E are not in the word at all (x)

So we know the pattern is S L _ _ _ and need to fill the last three slots with letters we haven’t ruled out.  
Letters still available (excluding A, T, E):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Good follow-up words use remaining common consonants and vowels.

Is there any better 5-letter word? Another option is SLOBS, but B and S are allowed, but S is already used. Another is SLOSH – H is allowed, S is already used. Between these, SLOW seems the most straightforward.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Words with frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, O, I, and C are good choices. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common ending letter

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters in English words.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word and in the correct first position (✓)
- L is in the word and in the correct second position (✓)
- A, T, E are not in the word at all (x)

So we know the pattern is S L _ _ _ and need to fill the last three slots with letters we haven’t ruled out.  
Letters still available (excluding A, T, E):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Good follow-up words use remaining common consonants and vowels.  
Let’s pick “SLING” because it keeps S and L in place and tests I, N, G—three new letters that appear frequently in English words.

Remaining unused vowels: O, U

We need a 5-letter word beginning with “SL” that avoids all the excluded letters.  
Good candidates:  
- SLUMP – uses M, P, U  
- SLURP – uses U, R, P  
- SLUMS – repeats S, so less likely  
- SLUBS – uncommon

The feedback from SLOW says the model answer is not five letters, so SLOW is not considered a valid guess for this game.  
I must pick a different 5-letter word that starts with SL and only uses the letters not yet ruled out:  
Allowed letters so far: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z, and the only vowel left is O.

Looking for common words beginning with SL using only these letters:  
- SLB_ _ – no common words  
- SLC_ _ – no common words  
- SLD_ _ – no common words  
- SLF_ _ – no common words  
- SLH_ _ – no common words

- SLW_ _ – SLW? not a word  
- SLX_ _ – no  
- SLY_ _ – SLY? only 4 letters  
- SLZ_ _ – no  

Wait, let me double-check:  
The only vowel left is O, and common 5-letter words beginning with SL that use O:  
- SLOBS – B and S are allowed, but S is already used in SL, and B is allowed.  
  SLOBS: S(✓) L(✓) O(?) B(?) S(?) – but S is already in position 1, so this would be S L O B S, which is 5 letters.  
  Letters used: S, L, O, B, S – all allowed (S is okay to reuse, but in Wordle-style games, letters can repeat unless ruled out).  
  However, in our previous guesses, S and L are already fixed in positions 1 and 2, so repeating S in position 5 is possible.  

Is SLOBS a valid guess here? Yes, because:  
- S and L are confirmed in positions 1 and 2.  
- O, B, S are not yet ruled out.  

Let me verify:  
- S(✓) L(✓) O(?) B(?) S(?) – positions 3,4,5 are unknown but allowed.  

Therefore, the most logical next guess is SLOBS.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Words with frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, O, I, and C are good choices. 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common ending letter

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters in English words.

From the latest feedback on SLOBS:
- S(✓) L(✓) O(✓) B(x) S(-)

This tells us:
1. S is correct in positions 1 and 5 (both times it got ✓ and - respectively).
2. L is correct in position 2 (✓).
3. O is correct in position 3 (✓).
4. B is not in the word at all (x).
5. The last S is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s currently in position 5, but the correct position is somewhere else—probably position 4, since position 1 is already correct for S).

So the pattern we now have is:
S L O _ S

We just need to fill position 4 with a letter that hasn’t been ruled out yet.  
Letters already excluded: A, T, E, I, N, G, U, M, P, B  
Letters still allowed: C, D, F, H, J, K, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z, and possibly others.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit S L O _ S, the most common are:
- SLODS – not a real word
- SLOFS – not a real word
- SLOKS – not a real word
- SLOVS – not a real word
- SLOWS – but W is allowed and SLOW was already rejected because it wasn’t 5 letters, but SLOW is 4 letters, so that’s not an issue here.
- SLOPS – but P is excluded
- SLOSH – H is allowed, but S is already in position 5 and we know S must be in position 4, so this would be S L O S H, but that’s 5 letters and fits the pattern S L O _ S with H in position 4.

Wait, let me double-check: the pattern is S L O _ S, so position 4 must be a single letter that hasn’t been excluded. The letter must be something like D, F, H, K, R, V, W, etc.

Looking at the word SLOSH:
- S L O S H – positions 1,2,3,4,5
- S is in position 1 (correct)
- L is in position 2 (correct)
- O is in position 3 (correct)
- S is in position 4 (this would be the correct position for the second S, since the first S is in position 1 and the feedback said S is in the word but wrong in position 5)
- H is in position 5 (but feedback said S is in the word but wrong in position 5, so position 5 cannot be S, but H hasn’t been ruled out)

But SLOSH is S L O S H, which would have S in position 4 and H in position 5. This fits all the constraints:
- S is correct in 1 and 4
- L is correct in 2
- O is correct in 3
- H is a new letter that hasn’t been ruled out
- The word is 5 letters and valid.

Another possible word is SLODS, but that’s not valid. SLOFS is invalid. SLOKS is invalid. SLOVS is invalid. So SLOSH seems to be the only common valid word that fits.

Let me check if SLOSH is a valid word: yes, it is (a sharp, ringing sound).

Therefore, the next guess should be SLOSH.
