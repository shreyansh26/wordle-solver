### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants (like S, T, R, N, L)
2. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Some popular starting words include: SLATE, CRANE, ADIEU, RAISE, STARE, CRISP, etc. Among these, ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to work with and should provide useful feedback regardless of the secret word.

A balanced word that satisfies the constraints and introduces new common letters is “CRONE”:
- C, R, O, N are all new letters.
- E is moved to position 4 (satisfies E is in word but not at position 5).

This should help us quickly identify which of these new letters are present and the correct placement of E.

Some popular starting words include: SLATE, CRANE, ADIEU, RAISE, STARE, CRISP, etc. Among these, ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it contains:

- E and N must both be in positions 1-4 (not 5)
- No repeats of E or N

Remaining common letters to test: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both E and N (each once)
- Contains none of S, L, A, T, C, R, O
- E and N must be in positions 1-4
- The fifth letter must be from the remaining pool

A good candidate is ""UNITE"":
- U, I, T are new letters, but T was already eliminated, so this is invalid.
Next candidate: ""PHONE"" – P, H, O, N, E. O is eliminated.
Next: ""MENUS"" – S is eliminated.
Next: ""VENUE"" – V, U, E, N, E – E repeats and U is new.
Next: ""DINER"" – R is eliminated.
Next: ""WINE"" – too short.
Next: ""MIDGE"" – G, D, I, M, E – but E must be with N.
Wait, we must have both E and N. So we need a word with both E and N, no S,L,A,T,C,R,O.

Let's think systematically:
Possible positions for E and N: positions 1-4, each once.
Remaining letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good word that fits is ""DINER"" – but R is eliminated.
""FINED"" – F, I, N, E, D – N and E present, no eliminated letters, and each in positions 1-4.
This seems valid.

Let's check:
- F, I, N, E, D
- Eliminated letters: S,L,A,T,C,R,O – none of these appear.
- E is in position 4 (allowed)
- N is in position 3 (allowed)
- No repeats.

""DINER"" is a valid word and meets all constraints.

Let's parse the new feedback:

DINER → D(✓) I(-) N(-) E(-) R(x)

- D is correct in position 1.
- I is in the word but not in position 2.
- N is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 4.
- R is not in the word (confirmed).

Current known facts:
1. Word starts with D (D _ _ _ _).
2. Must contain I, N, E, each once, and each must appear in positions not yet ruled out:
   - I not in position 2.
   - N not in position 3.
   - E not in position 4.
3. Eliminated letters so far: S, L, A, T, C, R, O.
4. Remaining candidate letters (besides D, I, N, E): B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with D, containing I, N, E exactly once each, with:
- I not in position 2
- N not in position 3
- E not in position 4

Possible positions for I, N, E:
- Positions 2,3,4,5 are open (but E can't be in 4, N can't be in 3, I can't be in 2).

Let's list possible permutations of I, N, E in positions 2-5 that satisfy constraints:
- E can be in 2,3,5
- N can be in 2,4,5
- I can be in 3,4,5

Looking for valid English words:

Option 1: E in 2, N in 4, I in 3 → D E I N _
Need a 5th letter in position 5. Possible: D E I N ? – but no common word.

Option 2: E in 2, N in 5, I in 3 or 4 → D E I _ N or D E _ I N
- D E I _ N: Need letter for position 4 – possible letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
  – DEIGN is a valid word (archaic spelling of ""deign"", but accepted in some word lists).

Option 3: E in 3, N in 2 or 4 or 5, I in 4 or 5
- E in 3, N in 2 → D N E _ _ – need two more letters, but I must fit somewhere.
  – DNIE_ – no common word.
- E in 3, N in 4 → D _ E N _ – need letter in 2 and 5.
  – D I E N _ – but I can't be in 2 (from feedback), so invalid.
  – D _ E N I – but I would be in 5, which is allowed. Need letter in 2: D ? E N I
    – Possible: D B E N I (no), D F E N I (no), D G E N I (no), D H E N I (no), D K E N I (no), D M E N I (no), D P E N I (no), D W E N I (no), etc. – no common word.

Option 4: E in 5, N in 2 or 4, I in 3 or 4
- E in 5, N in 2 → D N _ _ E – need letters in 3 and 4.
  – D N I _ E – need letter in 4: D N I ? E – DNICE? No.
  – D N _ I E – need letter in 3: D N ? I E – DNIE? No.
- E in 5, N in 4 → D _ _ N E – need letters in 2 and 3.
  – D I _ N E – need letter in 3: D I ? N E – D I B N E? No.
  – D _ I N E – need letter in 2: D ? I N E – D B I N E? No.

The only viable candidate from above is DEIGN (though archaic). However, let's check if there are any more common words.

Alternative approach: Maybe the word is D I N E _ but E can't be in 4, so invalid.
Or D I _ N E – but N would be in 4, which is allowed, and I in 2 is not allowed (from feedback I(-) in DINER means I is in word but not in 2).

Wait, let's re-examine the constraints:
- I is in word but not in position 2 (so I can be in 3,4,5)
- N is in word but not in position 3 (so N can be in 2,4,5)
- E is in word but not in position 4 (so E can be in 2,3,5)

Let's try:
- E in 3, N in 2 → D N E _ _ – need letters in 4 and 5. I must fit in 4 or 5.
  – D N E I _ – need letter in 5: D N E I ? – DN E I ? – DN E I B? No.
  – D N E _ I – need letter in 4: D N E ? I – DN E ? I – DN E B I? No.

Another permutation:
- E in 5, N in 2 → D N _ _ E – need letters in 3 and 4. I must fit in 3 or 4.
  – D N I _ E – need letter in 4: D N I ? E – DN I ? E – DN I B E? No.
  – D N _ I E – need letter in 3: D N ? I E – DN ? I E – DN B I E? No.

It seems DEIGN is the only possible word fitting these constraints, despite being archaic. However, let's check another possibility: maybe the word is D I N E _ but E can't be in 4, so invalid.

Wait, let's try:
- D _ _ _ _ with I, N, E in positions 2,3,4,5 with constraints:
  - I not in 2
  - N not in 3
  - E not in 4

Possible valid permutations:
- D I N E _ – but E is in 4, which is invalid.
- D I _ N E – I in 2 is invalid (from feedback).
- D _ I N E – I in 3 is allowed, N in 4 is allowed, E in 5 is allowed. Need letter in 2: D ? I N E
  – Possible letters for position 2: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
  – Looking for common words: D I N E _ – invalid, but D _ I N E – D B I N E? No, D G I N E? No, D H I N E? No, D M I N E? No, D P I N E? No, D W I N E? No.

Another permutation:
- D _ _ E N – E in 4 is invalid.
- D _ N E I – E in 4 invalid.
- D N E I _ – E in 3 is allowed, I in 4 is allowed, N in 2 is allowed. Need letter in 5: D N E I ? – DN E I ? – DN E I B? No.

It appears the only valid word is DEIGN, but let's check if there's a more common word. Alternatively, maybe the word is D I N E _ but E can't be in 4, so invalid.

Upon re-examining, the constraints are very tight. The only possible word seems to be DEIGN, but let's verify:
- DEIGN: D(✓) in position 1, E in position 2 (allowed), I in position 3 (allowed), N in position 4 (allowed), G is new. This satisfies all constraints.

Thus, the next logical guess is DEIGN.

Based on the feedback:
- D is locked in position 1.
- The word must contain I, N, and E, each exactly once.
- I cannot be in position 2, N cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 4.
- Eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, C, R, O.

The only valid permutation of I, N, E that fits the constraints is:
- D _ _ _ _ with I, N, E in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 such that:
  - I is in 3 or 4 or 5
