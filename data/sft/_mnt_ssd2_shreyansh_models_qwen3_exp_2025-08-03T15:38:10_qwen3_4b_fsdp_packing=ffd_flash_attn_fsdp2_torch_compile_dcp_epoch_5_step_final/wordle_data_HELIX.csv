### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possible letters in the secret word.

From the feedback:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
- DOES contain E, but not in the 5th position.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E somewhere in positions 1-4.
2. Uses none of A, R, O, S.
3. Uses common remaining consonants to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out).

Let me try a word that uses E plus common consonants and maybe I or U. ""UNTIE"" uses U, N, T, I, E - all still possible letters. It also places E in the 4th position, which is new information.

Another option is ""ELITE"" but that repeats E, which might not be optimal. ""UNTIE"" seems better for coverage.

Let's go with ""UNTIE"".

From the new feedback on UNTIE:
- U, N, T are NOT in the word (x).
- I is in the word and in the correct 4th position (✓).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Must be _ _ _ I _ (I is fixed in 4th spot).
- Must contain E, but not in 5th position (so E must be in 1, 2, or 3).
- Cannot contain A, R, O, S, U, N, T.

Remaining possible letters:
Vowels left: E, I (I already used in 4th), so only E can appear elsewhere.
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word that:
1. Has I in 4th position.
2. Has E in 1, 2, or 3.
3. Uses only remaining letters (no A, R, O, S, U, N, T).

Let's try E in 2nd position: _ E _ I _
Possible consonants for 1st, 3rd, 5th from remaining list.
A good candidate is ""CHEEI"" but that's not a valid word.
Next, ""DEIFY"" but F and Y are allowed, and it has I in 4th. But E is in 2nd, I in 4th, Y in 5th. However, ""DEIFY"" has F and Y which are allowed, but let me check if it's valid - yes, ""deify"" is valid.
But ""DEIFY"" has E in 2nd, I in 4th, Y in 5th, F in 3rd. This seems valid.

Another option is ""PEKIN"" but N is already excluded.
""WHITE"" but T is excluded.
""PIECE"" but C and E are allowed, but E is in 5th which is invalid.
""BEIGE"" but G and E are allowed, E in 5th invalid.
""LEMON"" but O and N are excluded.
""VIGOR"" but O and R are excluded.
""WHITE"" but T is excluded.
""CHIME"" - C, H, I, M, E. This has E in 5th which is invalid (E must be in wrong position, so can't be 5th).
""FLIME"" - F, L, I, M, E - same issue with E in 5th.
""ELBOW"" - O and W, but O is excluded.
""EXILE"" - X, L, I, E - but E is in 2nd, I in 4th, which is valid. But X is allowed, L is allowed. This seems valid.

Between ""DEIFY"" and ""EXILE"":
- ""DEIFY"": D, E, I, F, Y. All letters allowed, E in 2nd, I in 4th.
- ""EXILE"": E, X, I, L, E. But E is repeated and E in 1st is allowed, but we don't know if letters can repeat. The rules don't say letters can't repeat, but we should assume they might be unique unless proven otherwise.

""DEIFY"" seems better as it uses unique letters.

But let me think if there's a more common word. ""PEKIN"" is invalid due to N. ""BEIGE"" is invalid due to E in 5th. ""CHEEY"" - C, H, E, E, Y - repeats E. 

Another approach: E must be in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, I in 4th, and no forbidden letters. 

Possible patterns:
- E _ _ I _ (E in 1st)
- _ E _ I _ (E in 2nd)
- _ _ E I _ (E in 3rd)

For _ E _ I _ (E in 2nd):
Possible consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
A valid word: ""BEIGE"" - but E is in 2nd, I in 4th, but G and E are allowed. But E is repeated which might not be optimal.
""CHEESE"" - too long.
""DEIFY"" - already considered.

For _ _ E I _ (E in 3rd):
Possible word: ""BLEED"" - but D and E in 5th invalid.
""CLEVE"" - C, L, E, V, E - E in 3rd and 5th, but E in 5th invalid.
""FEVER"" - R excluded.
""PEKIE"" - N not in this word, but ""PEKIE"" is valid? Not sure.
""YEILD"" - L and D allowed, but Y in 1st, E in 3rd, I in 4th, L in 5th, D in 2nd. ""YEILD"" is actually ""YIELD"" which is valid. Letters: Y, I, E, L, D. All allowed, E in 3rd, I in 4th.

Between ""DEIFY"" and ""YEILD"":
- ""DEIFY"" has D, E, I, F, Y
- ""YEILD"" has Y, E, I, L, D

Both are valid, but ""YEILD"" uses more common letters (L, D) compared to F and Y. 

But ""YEILD"" is actually ""YIELD"" which is valid. Let's go with ""YIELD"".

However, let me double-check:
- Y: allowed
- I: allowed in 4th
- E: allowed in 3rd
- L: allowed
- D: allowed

This seems optimal.

But another thought: ""WHITE"" is invalid due to T. ""CHIME"" invalid due to E in 5th. 

""EXILE"" - E in 1st, X, I, L, E - but E is repeated.

""PEKIE"" - not sure if valid.

""BEIGE"" - E in 2nd, I in 4th, but G allowed.

But ""BEIGE"" has E in 2nd, I in 4th, G in 3rd, B in 1st, E in 5th - but E in 5th is invalid.

This is tricky. Let me try ""DEIFY"" as it seems most valid.

But actually, ""DEIFY"" has E in 2nd, I in 4th, D, I, F, Y - all allowed.

Yes, ""DEIFY"" seems the best.

But let me think if there's a more common word. ""PIECE"" - but E in 5th invalid. 

""PEKIE"" - not common.

""YEILD"" is valid but spelled ""YIELD"".

After reconsidering, ""YIELD"" seems the best valid word fitting the constraints.

But to ensure, let me check:
- Y: allowed
- I: in 4th (correct)
- E: in 3rd (allowed, not in 5th)
- L: allowed
- D: allowed

This meets all constraints.

Therefore, my next guess is ""YIELD"".

But actually, ""DEIFY"" has E in 2nd, I in 4th, D, I, F, Y - all allowed.

Yes, ""DEIFY"" seems the best.

""PEKIE"" - not common.

""YEILD"" is valid but spelled ""YIELD"".

But to ensure, let me check:
- Y: allowed

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possible letters in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
- DOES contain E, but not in the 5th position.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E somewhere in positions 1-4.
2. Uses none of A, R, O, S.
3. Uses common remaining consonants to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out).

Let me try a word that uses E plus common consonants and maybe I or U. ""UNTIE"" uses U, N, T, I, E - all still possible letters. It also places E in the 4th position, which is new information.

Another option is ""ELITE"" but that repeats E, which might not be optimal. ""UNTIE"" seems better for coverage.

Let's go with ""UNTIE"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on UNTIE:
- U, N, T are NOT in the word (x).
- I is in the word and in the correct 4th position (✓).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Must be _ _ _ I _ (I is fixed in 4th spot).
- Must contain E, but not in 5th position (so E must be in 1, 2, or 3).
- Cannot contain A, R, O, S, U, N, T.

Remaining possible letters:
Vowels left: E, I (I already used in 4th), so only E can appear elsewhere.
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word that:
1. Has I in 4th position.
2. Has E in 1, 2, or 3.
3. Uses only remaining letters (no A, R, O, S, U, N, T).

Let's try E in 2nd position: _ E _ I _
Possible consonants for 1st, 3rd, 5th from remaining list.
A good candidate is ""CHEEI"" but that's not a valid word.
Next, ""DEIFY"" but F and Y are allowed, and it has I in 4th. But E is in 2nd, I in 4th, Y in 5th. However, ""DEIFY"" has F and Y which are allowed, but let me check if it's valid - yes, ""deify"" is valid.
But ""DEIFY"" has E in 2nd, I in 4th, Y in 5th, F in 3rd. This seems valid.

Another option is ""PEKIN"" but N is already excluded.
""WHITE"" but T is excluded.
""PIECE"" but C and E are allowed, but E is in 5th which is invalid.
""BEIGE"" but G and E are allowed, E in 5th invalid.
""LEMON"" but O and N are excluded.
""VIGOR"" but O and R are excluded.
""WHITE"" but T is excluded.
""CHIME"" - C, H, I, M, E. This has E in 5th which is invalid (E must be in wrong position, so can't be 5th).
""FLIME"" - F, L, I, M, E - same issue with E in 5th.
""ELBOW"" - O and W, but O is excluded.
""EXILE"" - X, L, I, E - but E is in 2nd, I in 4th, which is valid. But X is allowed, L is allowed. This seems valid.

Between ""DEIFY"" and ""EXILE"":
- ""DEIFY"": D, E, I, F, Y. All letters allowed, E in 2nd, I in 4th.
- ""EXILE"": E, X, I, L, E. But E is repeated and E in 1st is allowed, but we don't know if letters can repeat. The rules don't say letters can't repeat, but we should assume they might be unique unless proven otherwise.

""DEIFY"" seems better as it uses unique letters.

But let me think if there's a more common word. ""PEKIN"" is invalid due to N. ""BEIGE"" is invalid due to E in 5th. ""CHEEY"" - C, H, E, E, Y - repeats E. 

Another approach: E must be in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, I in 4th, and no forbidden letters. 

Possible patterns:
- E _ _ I _ (E in 1st)
- _ E _ I _ (E in 2nd)
- _ _ E I _ (E in 3rd)

For _ E _ I _ (E in 2nd):
Possible consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
A valid word: ""BEIGE"" - but E is in 2nd, I in 4th, but G and E are allowed. But E is repeated which might not be optimal.
""CHEESE"" - too long.
""DEIFY"" - already considered.

For _ _ E I _ (E in 3rd):
Possible word: ""BLEED"" - but D and E in 5th invalid.
""CLEVE"" - C, L, E, V, E - E in 3rd and 5th, but E in 5th invalid.
""FEVER"" - R excluded.
""PEKIE"" - N not in this word, but ""PEKIE"" is valid? Not sure.
""YEILD"" - L and D allowed, but Y in 1st, E in 3rd, I in 4th, L in 5th, D in 2nd. ""YEILD"" is actually ""YIELD"" which is valid. Letters: Y, I, E, L, D. All allowed, E in 3rd, I in 4th.

Between ""DEIFY"" and ""YEILD"":
- ""DEIFY"" has D, E, I, F, Y
- ""YEILD"" has Y, E, I, L, D

Both are valid, but ""YEILD"" uses more common letters (L, D) compared to F and Y. 

But ""YEILD"" is actually ""YIELD"" which is valid. Let's go with ""YIELD"".

However, let me double-check:
- Y: allowed
- I: allowed in 4th
- E: allowed in 3rd
- L: allowed
- D: allowed

This seems optimal.

But another thought: ""WHITE"" is invalid due to T. ""CHIME"" invalid due to E in 5th. 

""EXILE"" - E in 1st, X, I, L, E - but E is repeated.

""PEKIE"" - not sure if valid.

""BEIGE"" - E in 2nd, I in 4th, but G allowed.

But ""BEIGE"" has E in 2nd, I in 4th, G in 3rd, B in 1st, E in 5th - but E in 5th is invalid.

This is tricky. Let me try ""DEIFY"" as it seems most valid.

But actually, ""DEIFY"" has E in 2nd, I in 4th, D, I, F, Y - all allowed.

Yes, ""DEIFY"" seems the best.

But let me think if there's a more common word. ""PIECE"" - but E in 5th invalid. 

""PEKIE"" - not common.

""YEILD"" is valid but spelled ""YIELD"".

After reconsidering, ""YIELD"" seems the best valid word fitting the constraints.

But to ensure, let me check:
- Y: allowed
- I: in 4th (correct)
- E: in 3rd (allowed, not in 5th)
- L: allowed
- D: allowed

This meets all constraints.

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possible letters in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
- DOES contain E, but not in the 5th position.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E somewhere in positions 1-4.
2. Uses none of A, R, O, S.
3. Uses common remaining consonants to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out).

Let me try a word that uses E plus common consonants and maybe I or U. ""UNTIE"" uses U, N, T, I, E - all still possible letters. It also places E in the 4th position, which is new information.

Another option is ""ELITE"" but that repeats E, which might not be optimal. ""UNTIE"" seems better for coverage.

Let's go with ""UNTIE"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on UNTIE:
- U, N, T are NOT in the word (x).
- I is in the word and in the correct 4th position (✓).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Must be _ _ _ I _ (I is fixed in 4th spot).
- Must contain E, but not in 5th position (so E must be in 1, 2, or 3).
- Cannot contain A, R, O, S, U, N, T.

Remaining possible letters:
Vowels left: E, I (I already used in 4th), so only E can appear elsewhere.
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word that:
1. Has I in 4th position.
2. Has E in 1, 2, or 3.
3. Uses only remaining letters (no A, R, O, S, U, N, T).

Let's try E in 2nd position: _ E _ I _
Possible consonants for 1st, 3rd, 5th from remaining list.
A good candidate is ""CHEEI"" but that's not a valid word.
Next, ""DEIFY"" but F and Y are allowed, and it has I in 4th. But E is in 2nd, I in 4th, Y in 5th. However, ""DEIFY"" has F and Y which are allowed, but let me check if it's valid - yes, ""deify"" is valid.
But ""DEIFY"" has E in 2nd, I in 4th, Y in 5th, F in 3rd. This seems valid.

Another option is ""PEKIN"" but N is already excluded.
""WHITE"" but T is excluded.
""PIECE"" but C and E are allowed, but E is in 5th which is invalid.
""BEIGE"" but G and E are allowed, E in 5th invalid.
""LEMON"" but O and N are excluded.
""VIGOR"" but O and R are excluded.
""WHITE"" but T is excluded.
""CHIME"" - C, H, I, M, E. This has E in 5th which is invalid (E must be in wrong position, so can't be 5th).
""FLIME"" - F, L, I, M, E - same issue with E in 5th.
""ELBOW"" - O and W, but O is excluded.
""EXILE"" - X, L, I, E - but E is in 2nd, I in 4th, which is valid. But X is allowed, L is allowed. This seems valid.

Between ""DEIFY"" and ""EXILE"":
- ""DEIFY"": D, E, I, F, Y. All letters allowed, E in 2nd, I in 4th.
- ""EXILE"": E, X, I, L, E. But E is repeated and E in 1st is allowed, but we don't know if letters can repeat. The rules don't say letters can't repeat, but we should assume they might be unique unless proven otherwise.

""DEIFY"" seems better as it uses unique letters.

But let me think if there's a more common word. ""PEKIN"" is invalid due to N. ""BEIGE"" is invalid due to E in 5th. ""CHEEY"" - C, H, E, E, Y - repeats E. 

Another approach: E must be in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, I in 4th, and no forbidden letters. 

Possible patterns:
- E _ _ I _ (E in 1st)
- _ E _ I _ (E in 2nd)
- _ _ E I _ (E in 3rd)

For _ E _ I _ (E in 2nd):
Possible consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
A valid word: ""BEIGE"" - but E is in 2nd, I in 4th, but G and E are allowed. But E is repeated which might not be optimal.
""CHEESE"" - too long.
""DEIFY"" - already considered.

For _ _ E I _ (E in 3rd):
Possible word: ""BLEED"" - but D and E in 5th invalid.
""CLEVE"" - C, L, E, V, E - E in 3rd and 5th, but E in 5th invalid.
""FEVER"" - R excluded.
""PEKIE"" - N not in this word, but ""PEKIE"" is valid? Not sure.
""YEILD"" - L and D allowed, but Y in 1st, E in 3rd, I in 4th, L in 5th, D in 2nd. ""YEILD"" is actually ""YIELD"" which is valid. Letters: Y, I, E, L, D. All allowed, E in 3rd, I in 4th.

Between ""DEIFY"" and ""YEILD"":
- ""DEIFY"" has D, E, I, F, Y
- ""YEILD"" has Y, E, I, L, D

Both are valid, but ""YEILD"" uses more common letters (L, D) compared to F and Y. 

But ""YEILD"" is actually ""YIELD"" which is valid. Let's go with ""YIELD"".

However, let me double-check:
- Y: allowed
- I: allowed in 4th
- E: allowed in 3rd
- L: allowed
- D: allowed

This seems optimal.

But another thought: ""WHITE"" is invalid due to T. ""CHIME"" invalid due to E in 5th. 

""EXILE"" - E in 1st, X, I, L, E - but E is repeated.

""PEKIE"" - not sure if valid.

""BEIGE"" - E in 2nd, I in 4th, but G allowed.

But ""BEIGE"" has E in 2nd, I in 4th, G in 3rd, B in 1st, E in 5th - but E in 5th is invalid.

This is tricky. Let me try ""DEIFY"" as it seems most valid.

But actually, ""DEIFY"" has E in 2nd, I in 4th, D, I, F, Y - all allowed.

Yes, ""DEIFY"" seems the best.

But let me think if there's a more common word. ""PIECE"" - but E in 5th invalid. 

""PEKIE"" - not common.

""YEILD"" is valid but spelled ""YIELD"".

After reconsidering, ""YIELD"" seems the best valid word fitting the constraints.

But to ensure, let me check:
- Y: allowed
- I: in 4th (correct)
- E: in 3rd (allowed, not in 5th)
- L: allowed
- D: allowed

This meets all constraints.

Therefore, my next guess is ""YIELD"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(✓) E(-)
Guess 3: YIELD -> FEEDBACK: Y(x) I(-) E(-) L(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's digest the new feedback from YIELD:

- Y (x) → Y is NOT in the word.
- I (-) → I is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- E (-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- L (-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- D (x) → D is NOT in the word.

Combining all constraints so far:

1. Letters known to be in the word: I, E, L  
   - I must be in position 4 (from UNTIE feedback).
   - E must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (cannot be 3 or 5 simultaneously with previous feedback, so 1, 2, or 5).
   - L must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 4).

2. Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, Y, D.

3. Pattern so far: _ _ _ I _ (I is fixed in 4th).

We have three letters to place: E, L, and one more consonant (from remaining allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z).

Possible positions for E and L:

Case 1: E in position 1
   E _ _ I _
   L must be in 2, 3, or 5.

Case 2: E in position 2
   _ E _ I _
   L must be in 1, 3, or 5.

Case 3: E in position 5
   _ _ _ I E
   L must be in 1, 2, or 3.

We need to find a valid 5-letter word fitting one of these cases.

Let's explore Case 2: _ E _ I _
   - E in 2, I in 4.
   - L must be in 1, 3, or 5.
   - Remaining letters to choose from: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible words:
   - BLEEK - invalid (double E, K allowed but E already placed)
   - CHEEK - invalid (double E)
   - FLECK - F, L, E, C, K - all allowed, E in 2, I not present - fails I placement
   - GLEAM - G, L, E, A, M - A excluded
   - PLEBE - P, L, E, B, E - double E
   - WLEEK - invalid
   - JELLY - J, E, L, L, Y - Y excluded
   - FLESH - F, L, E, S, H - S excluded
   - GLEAM - A excluded
   - BLEED - D excluded
   - PLEBE - valid but double E
   - VELVE - V, E, L, V, E - double E
   - HELIX - H, E, L, I, X - I must be in 4, here it's in 3 - fails
   - PELIC - P, E, L, I, C - I in 4, E in 2, L in 3 - this fits!

Check PELIC:
   - Letters: P, E, L, I, C
   - All allowed (P, E, L, I, C not in excluded list)
   - I in position 4 (correct)
   - E in position 2 (allowed)
   - L in position 3 (allowed)
   - No forbidden letters
   - Valid English word (variant spelling of ""pelican"" or a type of fish)

This seems to fit all constraints.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possible letters in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
- DOES contain E, but not in the 5th position.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E somewhere in positions 1-4.
2. Uses none of A, R, O, S.
3. Uses common remaining consonants to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out).

Let me try a word that uses E plus common consonants and maybe I or U. ""UNTIE"" uses U, N, T, I, E - all still possible letters. It also places E in the 4th position, which is new information.

Another option is ""ELITE"" but that repeats E, which might not be optimal. ""UNTIE"" seems better for coverage.

Let's go with ""UNTIE"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on UNTIE:
- U, N, T are NOT in the word (x).
- I is in the word and in the correct 4th position (✓).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Must be _ _ _ I _ (I is fixed in 4th spot).
- Must contain E, but not in 5th position (so E must be in 1, 2, or 3).
- Cannot contain A, R, O, S, U, N, T.

Remaining possible letters:
Vowels left: E, I (I already used in 4th), so only E can appear elsewhere.
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word that:
1. Has I in 4th position.
2. Has E in 1, 2, or 3.
3. Uses only remaining letters (no A, R, O, S, U, N, T).

Let's try E in 2nd position: _ E _ I _
Possible consonants for 1st, 3rd, 5th from remaining list.
A good candidate is ""CHEEI"" but that's not a valid word.
Next, ""DEIFY"" but F and Y are allowed, and it has I in 4th. But E is in 2nd, I in 4th, Y in 5th. However, ""DEIFY"" has F and Y which are allowed, but let me check if it's valid - yes, ""deify"" is valid.
But ""DEIFY"" has E in 2nd, I in 4th, Y in 5th, F in 3rd. This seems valid.

Another option is ""PEKIN"" but N is already excluded.
""WHITE"" but T is excluded.
""PIECE"" but C and E are allowed, but E is in 5th which is invalid.
""BEIGE"" but G and E are allowed, E in 5th invalid.
""LEMON"" but O and N are excluded.
""VIGOR"" but O and R are excluded.
""WHITE"" but T is excluded.
""CHIME"" - C, H, I, M, E. This has E in 5th which is invalid (E must be in wrong position, so can't be 5th).
""FLIME"" - F, L, I, M, E - same issue with E in 5th.
""ELBOW"" - O and W, but O is excluded.
""EXILE"" - X, L, I, E - but E is in 2nd, I in 4th, which is valid. But X is allowed, L is allowed. This seems valid.

Between ""DEIFY"" and ""EXILE"":
- ""DEIFY"": D, E, I, F, Y. All letters allowed, E in 2nd, I in 4th.
- ""EXILE"": E, X, I, L, E. But E is repeated and E in 1st is allowed, but we don't know if letters can repeat. The rules don't say letters can't repeat, but we should assume they might be unique unless proven otherwise.

""DEIFY"" seems better as it uses unique letters.

But let me think if there's a more common word. ""PEKIN"" is invalid due to N. ""BEIGE"" is invalid due to E in 5th. ""CHEEY"" - C, H, E, E, Y - repeats E. 

Another approach: E must be in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, I in 4th, and no forbidden letters. 

Possible patterns:
- E _ _ I _ (E in 1st)
- _ E _ I _ (E in 2nd)
- _ _ E I _ (E in 3rd)

For _ E _ I _ (E in 2nd):
Possible consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
A valid word: ""BEIGE"" - but E is in 2nd, I in 4th, but G and E are allowed. But E is repeated which might not be optimal.
""CHEESE"" - too long.
""DEIFY"" - already considered.

For _ _ E I _ (E in 3rd):
Possible word: ""BLEED"" - but D and E in 5th invalid.
""CLEVE"" - C, L, E, V, E - E in 3rd and 5th, but E in 5th invalid.
""FEVER"" - R excluded.
""PEKIE"" - N not in this word, but ""PEKIE"" is valid? Not sure.
""YEILD"" - L and D allowed, but Y in 1st, E in 3rd, I in 4th, L in 5th, D in 2nd. ""YEILD"" is actually ""YIELD"" which is valid. Letters: Y, I, E, L, D. All allowed, E in 3rd, I in 4th.

Between ""DEIFY"" and ""YEILD"":
- ""DEIFY"" has D, E, I, F, Y
- ""YEILD"" has Y, E, I, L, D

Both are valid, but ""YEILD"" uses more common letters (L, D) compared to F and Y. 

But ""YEILD"" is actually ""YIELD"" which is valid. Let's go with ""YIELD"".

However, let me double-check:
- Y: allowed
- I: allowed in 4th
- E: allowed in 3rd
- L: allowed
- D: allowed

This seems optimal.

But another thought: ""WHITE"" is invalid due to T. ""CHIME"" invalid due to E in 5th. 

""EXILE"" - E in 1st, X, I, L, E - but E is repeated.

""PEKIE"" - not sure if valid.

""BEIGE"" - E in 2nd, I in 4th, but G allowed.

But ""BEIGE"" has E in 2nd, I in 4th, G in 3rd, B in 1st, E in 5th - but E in 5th is invalid.

This is tricky. Let me try ""DEIFY"" as it seems most valid.

But actually, ""DEIFY"" has E in 2nd, I in 4th, D, I, F, Y - all allowed.

Yes, ""DEIFY"" seems the best.

But let me think if there's a more common word. ""PIECE"" - but E in 5th invalid. 

""PEKIE"" - not common.

""YEILD"" is valid but spelled ""YIELD"".

After reconsidering, ""YIELD"" seems the best valid word fitting the constraints.

But to ensure, let me check:
- Y: allowed
- I: in 4th (correct)
- E: in 3rd (allowed, not in 5th)
- L: allowed
- D: allowed

This meets all constraints.

Therefore, my next guess is ""YIELD"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(✓) E(-)
Guess 3: YIELD -> FEEDBACK: Y(x) I(-) E(-) L(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's digest the new feedback from YIELD:

- Y (x) → Y is NOT in the word.
- I (-) → I is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- E (-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- L (-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- D (x) → D is NOT in the word.

Combining all constraints so far:

1. Letters known to be in the word: I, E, L  
   - I must be in position 4 (from UNTIE feedback).
   - E must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (cannot be 3 or 5 simultaneously with previous feedback, so 1, 2, or 5).
   - L must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 4).

2. Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, Y, D.

3. Pattern so far: _ _ _ I _ (I is fixed in 4th).

We have three letters to place: E, L, and one more consonant (from remaining allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z).

Possible positions for E and L:

Case 1: E in position 1
   E _ _ I _
   L must be in 2, 3, or 5.

Case 2: E in position 2
   _ E _ I _
   L must be in 1, 3, or 5.

Case 3: E in position 5
   _ _ _ I E
   L must be in 1, 2, or 3.

We need to find a valid 5-letter word fitting one of these cases.

Let's explore Case 2: _ E _ I _
   - E in 2, I in 4.
   - L must be in 1, 3, or 5.
   - Remaining letters to choose from: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Possible words:
   - BLEEK - invalid (double E, K allowed but E already placed)
   - CHEEK - invalid (double E)
   - FLECK - F, L, E, C, K - all allowed, E in 2, I not present - fails I placement
   - GLEAM - G, L, E, A, M - A excluded
   - PLEBE - P, L, E, B, E - double E
   - WLEEK - invalid
   - JELLY - J, E, L, L, Y - Y excluded
   - FLESH - F, L, E, S, H - S excluded
   - GLEAM - A excluded
   - BLEED - D excluded
   - PLEBE - valid but double E
   - VELVE - V, E, L, V, E - double E
   - HELIX - H, E, L, I, X - I must be in 4, here it's in 3 - fails
   - PELIC - P, E, L, I, C - I in 4, E in 2, L in 3 - this fits!

Check PELIC:
   - Letters: P, E, L, I, C
   - All allowed (P, E, L, I, C not in excluded list)
   - I in position 4 (correct)
   - E in position 2 (allowed)
   - L in position 3 (allowed)
   - No forbidden letters
   - Valid English word (variant spelling of ""pelican"" or a type of fish)

This seems to fit all constraints.
