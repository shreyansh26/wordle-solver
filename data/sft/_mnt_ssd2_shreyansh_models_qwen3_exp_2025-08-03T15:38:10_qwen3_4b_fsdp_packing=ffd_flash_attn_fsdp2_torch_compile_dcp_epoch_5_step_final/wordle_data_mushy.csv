For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word often includes vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down the possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S is present, but not in slot 1)
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S somewhere other than the first position
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (and not in first position)
2. Excludes L, A, T, E
3. Still gives us maximal information

Good consonants to try next: R, N, D, C, M, P, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, O, U (since A and E are out)

A strong next guess would be a word that uses S in a different position and introduces new common letters. ""CRISP"" comes to mind, but it has P and I, and S is in position 4. Alternatively, ""DRINK"" uses R, I, N, K but no S. 

Let me pick a word that has S in position 2 or 3, and introduces new common letters. ""SPURN"" has S in position 1 (but we know S is not in position 1), so that's bad. ""SURFS"" has S in position 5, which is allowed, but it repeats S. 

""SHORN"" has S in position 1 (invalid), so no. ""SOUND"" has S in position 1 (invalid). ""SPORK"" has S in position 1 (invalid). 

""SCION"" has S in position 1 (invalid). ""SNIPE"" has S in position 1 (invalid). 

""ROUSE"" has S in position 4, and introduces R, O, U. But S is in position 4, which is allowed. Let's check:
- R: new letter
- O: new vowel
- U: new vowel
- S: known to be in word, now in position 4 (allowed)
- E: already ruled out (from SLATE feedback), so E is invalid. 

So ""ROUSE"" is invalid because E is excluded. 

""ROUND"" has R, O, U, N, D - no S, but we know S is in the word, so this is bad. 

""SPURN"" - S is in position 1 (invalid). 

""PRISM"" has P, R, I, S, M - S in position 4, and introduces P, R, I, M. This seems good:
- S is in position 4 (allowed, since position 1 was ruled out)
- P, R, I, M are new letters

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
L, A, T, E, P, R, I

Letters that ARE in the word, but whose exact positions are still unknown:
S (must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, since it was wrong in positions 1 and 4)
M (must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5, since it was wrong in position 4)

So the secret word contains both S and M, and we still need to place them correctly.  
We also still need two more letters, which must come from the remaining unused alphabet (excluding L, A, T, E, P, R, I).

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, N, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: O, U (since A and E are out, and I is out).

A good next guess should:
1. Place S and M in new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters (especially O or U).
3. Avoid any already-eliminated letters.

Let’s try a word that places S in position 2 and M in position 3, and fills the other slots with new common letters.  
For example:  
- Position 1: C (common consonant)  
- Position 2: S (new position for S)  
- Position 3: M (new position for M)  
- Position 4: O (new vowel)  
- Position 5: N (common consonant)

This gives us “CSMON” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Let’s rearrange to form a valid word: “COMBS” – but that has B and S in position 5, and we already know S is not in position 4 (from PRISM feedback).  

Another rearrangement: “SCONM” – invalid.  
Let’s pick a valid word that satisfies the constraints: “SCUM” is 4 letters, so no.  
“SCUMP” – invalid.  
“SCOWL” – has O, W, L. L is eliminated.  
“SMOKY” – has O, K, Y. S in 1, but S cannot be in 1.  
“SMUG” – too short.  
“SMUGG” – invalid.  
“SMUGO” – invalid.  
“SMUCK” – invalid.  
“SMUGS” – S in 5 (allowed), M in 1 (allowed), U, G, S.  
But SMUGS repeats S and we don’t know if letters can repeat.  

Let’s try a word that places S in 3 and M in 1: “MUSKY” – M in 1 (allowed), U, S in 3 (allowed), K, Y.  
Check letters: M, U, S, K, Y – none are in the eliminated list.  
And positions:  
- M is in 1 (was wrong in 4, so allowed)  
- S is in 3 (was wrong in 1 and 4, so allowed)  

“MUSKY” is a valid English word and satisfies all constraints.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word often includes vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down the possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S is present, but not in slot 1)
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S somewhere other than the first position
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (and not in first position)
2. Excludes L, A, T, E
3. Still gives us maximal information

Good consonants to try next: R, N, D, C, M, P, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, O, U (since A and E are out)

A strong next guess would be a word that uses S in a different position and introduces new common letters. ""CRISP"" comes to mind, but it has P and I, and S is in position 4. Alternatively, ""DRINK"" uses R, I, N, K but no S. 

Let me pick a word that has S in position 2 or 3, and introduces new common letters. ""SPURN"" has S in position 1 (but we know S is not in position 1), so that's bad. ""SURFS"" has S in position 5, which is allowed, but it repeats S. 

""SHORN"" has S in position 1 (invalid), so no. ""SOUND"" has S in position 1 (invalid). ""SPORK"" has S in position 1 (invalid). 

""SCION"" has S in position 1 (invalid). ""SNIPE"" has S in position 1 (invalid). 

""ROUSE"" has S in position 4, and introduces R, O, U. But S is in position 4, which is allowed. Let's check:
- R: new letter
- O: new vowel
- U: new vowel
- S: known to be in word, now in position 4 (allowed)
- E: already ruled out (from SLATE feedback), so E is invalid. 

So ""ROUSE"" is invalid because E is excluded. 

""ROUND"" has R, O, U, N, D - no S, but we know S is in the word, so this is bad. 

""SPURN"" - S is in position 1 (invalid). 

""PRISM"" has P, R, I, S, M - S in position 4, and introduces P, R, I, M. This seems good:
- S is in position 4 (allowed, since position 1 was ruled out)
- P, R, I, M are new letters
- No L, A, T, E

This seems like a strong next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
L, A, T, E, P, R, I

Letters that ARE in the word, but whose exact positions are still unknown:
S (must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, since it was wrong in positions 1 and 4)
M (must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5, since it was wrong in position 4)

So the secret word contains both S and M, and we still need to place them correctly.  
We also still need two more letters, which must come from the remaining unused alphabet (excluding L, A, T, E, P, R, I).

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, N, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: O, U (since A and E are out, and I is out).

A good next guess should:
1. Place S and M in new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters (especially O or U).
3. Avoid any already-eliminated letters.

Let’s try a word that places S in position 2 and M in position 3, and fills the other slots with new common letters.  
For example:  
- Position 1: C (common consonant)  
- Position 2: S (new position for S)  
- Position 3: M (new position for M)  
- Position 4: O (new vowel)  
- Position 5: N (common consonant)

This gives us “CSMON” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Let’s rearrange to form a valid word: “COMBS” – but that has B and S in position 5, and we already know S is not in position 4 (from PRISM feedback).  

Another rearrangement: “SCONM” – invalid.  
Let’s pick a valid word that satisfies the constraints: “SCUM” is 4 letters, so no.  
“SCUMP” – invalid.  
“SCOWL” – has O, W, L. L is eliminated.  
“SMOKY” – has O, K, Y. S in 1, but S cannot be in 1.  
“SMUG” – too short.  
“SMUGG” – invalid.  
“SMUGO” – invalid.  
“SMUCK” – invalid.  
“SMUGS” – S in 5 (allowed), M in 1 (allowed), U, G, S.  
But SMUGS repeats S and we don’t know if letters can repeat.  

Let’s try a word that places S in 3 and M in 1: “MUSKY” – M in 1 (allowed), U, S in 3 (allowed), K, Y.  
Check letters: M, U, S, K, Y – none are in the eliminated list.  
And positions:  
- M is in 1 (was wrong in 4, so allowed)  
- S is in 3 (was wrong in 1 and 4, so allowed)  

“MUSKY” is a valid English word and satisfies all constraints.

Remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, N, V, W, Z, etc.

We need a single letter to fill position 4 that is not in the excluded list and makes a valid 5-letter English word of the form M U S _ Y.

Possible valid words:
- MUSLY – not a common word
- MUSKY – already guessed (K is excluded)
- MUSAY – not a word
- MUSSY – double S, but valid and uses S again (allowed since S is already confirmed)
