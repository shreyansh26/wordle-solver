2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is a strong candidate because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should help identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, S, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.
- DOES contain O, but not in the 3rd position.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses the known letter O in a different position.
2. Avoids the eliminated letters A, R, S, E.
3. Introduces new common letters to test.

Good remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, H.

A balanced word that satisfies these rules is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are new letters.
- O is moved to position 2 (from position 3 in arose).

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word (x): A, R, S, E, P, I, T, B, U  
Letters confirmed IN the word:  
- O is in position 2 (✓ from point and bound)  
- N is in the word but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from point, bound)  
- D is in the word but not in position 5 (from bound)

So N must be in position 1, and the word looks like: N O _ _ _

Letters still allowed: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, V, W, Y, Z  
We need two more distinct letters from this set to fill positions 3 and 4.

A common word that fits is “N O C K Y”.  
Check:  
- N in position 1 (required)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is a strong candidate because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should help identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, S, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.
- DOES contain O, but not in the 3rd position.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses the known letter O in a different position.
2. Avoids the eliminated letters A, R, S, E.
3. Introduces new common letters to test.

Good remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, H.

A balanced word that satisfies these rules is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are new letters.
- O is moved to position 2 (from position 3 in arose).

Current constraints:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, T
- Letters confirmed IN the word:
  – O in position 2 (from point feedback)
  – N is in the word but not in position 4 (from point feedback)
- Remaining unused common letters: C, U, D, L, G, H, M, Y, B, F, K, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 2nd position.
2. Contains N somewhere other than 4th.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible patterns: _ O _ _ _ with N somewhere else.

Let’s try “BOUND”:
- B, U, D are new letters.
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- N is in position 3 (allowed, since it’s not position 4).
- All letters are still possible (none are in the banned list).

This seems like a good test of B, U, D and a new position for N.

Let's consolidate everything we know after four guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):
A, R, S, E, P, I, T, B, U, K, Y

Letters that ARE in the word:
- O is in position 2 (✓ from guesses 2, 3, 4)
- N is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from guesses 2, 3, 4)
  – The only remaining spot for N is position 2, but position 2 is already taken by O.
  – This contradiction means our assumption was wrong: N must have been mis-recorded.
  – Rechecking feedback: in guess 4 (nocky) N was marked (-), i.e., in the word but wrong position. But position 1 of nocky is N, so N cannot be in position 1.
  – From all previous guesses:
        – guess 2 (point): N(-) → N not in position 3
        – guess 3 (bound): N(-) → N not in position 3 (already known)
        – guess 4 (nocky): N(-) → N not in position 1
  – Therefore N must be in position 4 or 5, but earlier feedback said N(-) in bound (position 3) and nocky (position 1), so N is allowed in 4 or 5.

Wait, let's re-express the constraints more carefully:

From guess 2 (point): N(-) → N is in word but not in position 3.
From guess 3 (bound): N(-) → N is in word but not in position 3 (same info).
From guess 4 (nocky): N(-) → N is in word but not in position 1.
So N is in word, positions allowed: 2, 4, 5. But position 2 is O (confirmed), so N must be in position 4 or 5.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
C (from guess 4, C was (-) → in word but wrong position, i.e., not position 3)
D (from guess 3, D(-) → in word but not position 5)
Letters left: C, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, V, W, Z

We need a word of form _ O _ _ _ with N in position 4 or 5, and using allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ O _ N _  (N in 4)
- _ O _ _ N  (N in 5)

Let's try ""F O C U N"" – but U is already ruled out.
Next, ""M O C K N"" – K is ruled out.
""H O C K N"" – K ruled out.
""L O C K N"" – K ruled out.
""W O C K N"" – K ruled out.
""G O C K N"" – K ruled out.

Alternative: ""M O D N_"" – D is allowed, but N in 4, need one more letter.
""M O D N_"" – need 5th letter, must be allowed.
""M O D N L"" – is ""MODNL"" a word? No.
""H O D N L"" – ""HODNL""? No.

Another approach: since C was (-) in guess 4 (position 3), C is in word but not position 3. So C could be in 1, 4, or 5.

We have:
- _ O _ _ _
- N must be in 4 or 5
- C must be in 1, 4, or 5 (but 4 or 5 might be taken by N)

Let's try:
- C O _ N _  (C in 1, N in 4)
  Need letters 3 and 5 from allowed set.
  Allowed letters left: F, G, H, J, L, M, V, W, Z
  ""C O M N D"" – D is allowed, but D was (-) in position 5 (from bound), meaning D is in word but not position 5. So D could be in 3 or 4. In this case D would be in 5, which is invalid.
  ""C O G N L"" – ""COGN L""? Not a word.
  ""C O M N L"" – ""COMNL""? No.

Next pattern: _ O C _ N (C in 3 is invalid because C must be in 1,4,5)
Next: _ O _ C N (C in 4)
Need 1st and 3rd letters from allowed.
""F O L C N"" – ""FOLCN""? No.
""M O L C N"" – ""MOLCN""? No.
""H O L C N"" – ""HOLCN""? No.

Next pattern: _ O _ N C (C in 5)
Need 1st and 3rd letters from allowed.
""F O L N C"" – ""FOLNC""? No.
""M O L N C"" – ""MOLNC""? No.
""W O L N C"" – ""WOLNC""? No.

Wait, let's try ""M O L D N"" – but D was (-) in position 5, so D could be in 3 or 4.
""M O D L N"" – ""MODLN""? No.
""H O D L N"" – ""HODLN""? No.

This is tricky. Let's list all possible words fitting _ O _ _ _ with N in 4 or 5 and letters from remaining pool.

Remaining letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, V, W, Z

Possible words:
- ""F O G N D"" – ""FOGND""? No.
- ""M O D N G"" – ""MODNG""? No.
- ""W O D N G"" – ""WODNG""? No.
- ""C O D N G"" – ""CODNG""? No.
- ""L O D N G"" – ""Lodng""? No.

Actually, let's think of real words:
- ""M O C H Y"" – Y is ruled out.
- ""M O D L Y"" – Y ruled out.
- ""M O D G Y"" – Y ruled out.
- ""M O D L N"" – ""MODLN""? Not a word.
- ""M O C K N"" – K ruled out.
- ""M O C N D"" – D is allowed, but D was (-) in position 5, meaning D is in word but not position 5, so D could be in 3 or 4.
  ""M O D N C"" – C in 5 is allowed, D in 3 is allowed.
  ""M O D N C"" – is this a word? No.
- ""M O L N D"" – ""MOLND""? No.
- ""F O L D N"" – ""FOLDN""? No.
- ""W O L D N"" – ""WOLDN""? No.
- ""C O L D N"" – ""COLDN""? No.
- ""G O L D N"" – ""GOLDN""? No.

This seems impossible. Maybe I missed something.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback:
Guess 4: nocky -> N(-) O(✓) C(-) K(x) Y(x)
This means:
- N is in word but not position 1
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- C is in word but not position 3
- K and Y are not in word

So:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ _
- N must be in positions 2,3,4,5. But position 2 is O, so N must be in 3,4, or 5.
- C must be in positions 1,2,4,5. But position 2 is O, so C must be in 1,4, or 5.

Also, D was (-) in position 5 (from guess 3), meaning D is in word but not position 5. So D could be in 1,2,3,4. Position 2 is O, so D could be in 1,3, or 4.

Let's try:
- C in 1, N in 3: C O N _ _
  Need 4th and 5th letters from allowed: D, F, G, H, J, L, M, V, W, Z

  ""C O V _ N"" – ""COV_N""? No.
  ""C O W _ N"" – ""COW_N""? No.
  ""C O Z _ N"" – ""COZ_N""? No.

This seems impossible. Maybe I missed that N could be in position 2, but position 2 is O. So N cannot be in position 2.

Wait, let's try ""D"" in position 1:
- D O _ _ _
- N must be in 3,4, or 5
- C must be in 1,4, or 5. If D is in 1, C could be in 4 or 5.
- Possible words:
  ""D O C _ N"" – ""DOC_N""? No.
  ""D O _ C N"" – ""D _ C N"" – need 3rd letter from allowed: F, G, H, J, L, M, V, W, Z

This is very restrictive. Let's try ""M"" in position 1:
- M O _ _ _
- N must be in 3,4, or 5
- C must be in 1,4, or 5. If M is in 1, C could be in 4 or 5.
- Possible words:
  ""M O C _ N"" – ""MO C _ N"" – need 4th letter from allowed: D, F, G, H, J, L, V, W, Z
  ""M O C D N"" – ""MOCDN""? No.

  ""M O C V N"" – ""MOCVN""? No.
  ""M O C W N"" – ""MO C W N""? No.
  ""M O C Z N"" – ""MO C Z N""? No.

This seems impossible. Maybe I missed that N could be in position 3:
- _ O N _ _
- C must be in 1,4, or 5
- D must be in 1,3, or 4 (but 3 is N), so D in 1 or 4
- Possible words:

This is impossible. I must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Re-examining the feedback:
Guess 4: nocky -> N(-) O(✓) C(-) K(x) Y(x)
- N(-) means N is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- O(✓) means O is in position 2 (correct).
- C(-) means C is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- K and Y are not in the word.

So:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ _
- N is in word, positions allowed: 2,3,4,5. But position 2 is O, so N must be in 3,4, or 5.
- C is in word, positions allowed: 1,2,4,5. Position 2 is O, so C must be in 1,4, or 5.
- D was (-) in position 5 (from guess 3: bound), meaning D is in word but NOT in position 5, so D must be in 1,3, or 4.

Let's try:

  ""C O N Z V"" – ""CONZV""? No.
  ""C O N Z W"" – ""CONZW""? No.

This is impossible. The only remaining possibility is that I missed a word.

Let me try ""M O N D Y"" – Y is ruled out.
""M O N D L"" – ""MONDL""? No.
""M O N D C"" – ""MONDC""? No.
""M O N C H"" – ""MONCH""? Yes, ""MONCH"" is a valid word (a type of nut or a variant spelling of monarch).

Check constraints:
- M: allowed
- O: position 2 (✓)
- N: position 3 (allowed)
- C: position 4 (allowed, since C was (-) in position 3)
- H: allowed

This fits all constraints.

<guess>monch</guess>
</think>

<guess>monch</guess>",monch,"Let's consolidate everything we know after four guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):
A, R, S, E, P, I, T, B, U, K, Y

Letters that ARE in the word:
- O is in position 2 (✓ from guesses 2, 3, 4)
- N is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from guesses 2, 3, 4)
  – The only remaining spot for N is position 2, but position 2 is already taken by O.
  – This contradiction means our assumption was wrong: N must have been mis-recorded.
  – Rechecking feedback: in guess 4 (nocky) N was marked (-), i.e., in the word but wrong position. But position 1 of nocky is N, so N cannot be in position 1.
  – From all previous guesses:
        – guess 2 (point): N(-) → N not in position 3
        – guess 3 (bound): N(-) → N not in position 3 (already known)
        – guess 4 (nocky): N(-) → N not in position 1
  – Therefore N must be in position 4 or 5, but earlier feedback said N(-) in bound (position 3) and nocky (position 1), so N is allowed in 4 or 5.

Wait, let's re-express the constraints more carefully:

From guess 2 (point): N(-) → N is in word but not in position 3.
From guess 3 (bound): N(-) → N is in word but not in position 3 (same info).
From guess 4 (nocky): N(-) → N is in word but not in position 1.
So N is in word, positions allowed: 2, 4, 5. But position 2 is O (confirmed), so N must be in position 4 or 5.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
C (from guess 4, C was (-) → in word but wrong position, i.e., not position 3)
D (from guess 3, D(-) → in word but not position 5)
Letters left: C, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, V, W, Z

We need a word of form _ O _ _ _ with N in position 4 or 5, and using allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ O _ N _  (N in 4)
- _ O _ _ N  (N in 5)

Let's try ""F O C U N"" – but U is already ruled out.
Next, ""M O C K N"" – K is ruled out.
""H O C K N"" – K ruled out.
""L O C K N"" – K ruled out.
""W O C K N"" – K ruled out.
""G O C K N"" – K ruled out.

Alternative: ""M O D N_"" – D is allowed, but N in 4, need one more letter.
""M O D N_"" – need 5th letter, must be allowed.
""M O D N L"" – is ""MODNL"" a word? No.
""H O D N L"" – ""HODNL""? No.

Another approach: since C was (-) in guess 4 (position 3), C is in word but not position 3. So C could be in 1, 4, or 5.

We have:
- _ O _ _ _
- N must be in 4 or 5
- C must be in 1, 4, or 5 (but 4 or 5 might be taken by N)

Let's try:
- C O _ N _  (C in 1, N in 4)
  Need letters 3 and 5 from allowed set.
  Allowed letters left: F, G, H, J, L, M, V, W, Z
  ""C O M N D"" – D is allowed, but D was (-) in position 5 (from bound), meaning D is in word but not position 5. So D could be in 3 or 4. In this case D would be in 5, which is invalid.
  ""C O G N L"" – ""COGN L""? Not a word.
  ""C O M N L"" – ""COMNL""? No.

Next pattern: _ O C _ N (C in 3 is invalid because C must be in 1,4,5)
Next: _ O _ C N (C in 4)
Need 1st and 3rd letters from allowed.
""F O L C N"" – ""FOLCN""? No.
""M O L C N"" – ""MOLCN""? No.
""H O L C N"" – ""HOLCN""? No.

Next pattern: _ O _ N C (C in 5)
Need 1st and 3rd letters from allowed.
""F O L N C"" – ""FOLNC""? No.
""M O L N C"" – ""MOLNC""? No.
""W O L N C"" – ""WOLNC""? No.

Wait, let's try ""M O L D N"" – but D was (-) in position 5, so D could be in 3 or 4.
""M O D L N"" – ""MODLN""? No.
""H O D L N"" – ""HODLN""? No.

This is tricky. Let's list all possible words fitting _ O _ _ _ with N in 4 or 5 and letters from remaining pool.

Remaining letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, V, W, Z

Possible words:
- ""F O G N D"" – ""FOGND""? No.
- ""M O D N G"" – ""MODNG""? No.
- ""W O D N G"" – ""WODNG""? No.
- ""C O D N G"" – ""CODNG""? No.
- ""L O D N G"" – ""Lodng""? No.

Actually, let's think of real words:
- ""M O C H Y"" – Y is ruled out.
- ""M O D L Y"" – Y ruled out.
- ""M O D G Y"" – Y ruled out.
- ""M O D L N"" – ""MODLN""? Not a word.
- ""M O C K N"" – K ruled out.
- ""M O C N D"" – D is allowed, but D was (-) in position 5, meaning D is in word but not position 5, so D could be in 3 or 4.
  ""M O D N C"" – C in 5 is allowed, D in 3 is allowed.
  ""M O D N C"" – is this a word? No.
- ""M O L N D"" – ""MOLND""? No.
- ""F O L D N"" – ""FOLDN""? No.
- ""W O L D N"" – ""WOLDN""? No.
- ""C O L D N"" – ""COLDN""? No.
- ""G O L D N"" – ""GOLDN""? No.

This seems impossible. Maybe I missed something.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback:
Guess 4: nocky -> N(-) O(✓) C(-) K(x) Y(x)
This means:
- N is in word but not position 1
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- C is in word but not position 3
- K and Y are not in word

So:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ _
- N must be in positions 2,3,4,5. But position 2 is O, so N must be in 3,4, or 5.
- C must be in positions 1,2,4,5. But position 2 is O, so C must be in 1,4, or 5.

Also, D was (-) in position 5 (from guess 3), meaning D is in word but not position 5. So D could be in 1,2,3,4. Position 2 is O, so D could be in 1,3, or 4.

Let's try:
- C in 1, N in 3: C O N _ _
  Need 4th and 5th letters from allowed: D, F, G, H, J, L, M, V, W, Z
  ""C O N D L"" – ""COND L""? No.

  ""C O V _ N"" – ""COV_N""? No.
  ""C O W _ N"" – ""COW_N""? No.
  ""C O Z _ N"" – ""COZ_N""? No.

This seems impossible. Maybe I missed that N could be in position 2, but position 2 is O. So N cannot be in position 2.

Wait, let's try ""D"" in position 1:
- D O _ _ _
- N must be in 3,4, or 5
- C must be in 1,4, or 5. If D is in 1, C could be in 4 or 5.
- Possible words:
  ""D O C _ N"" – ""DOC_N""? No.
  ""D O _ C N"" – ""D _ C N"" – need 3rd letter from allowed: F, G, H, J, L, M, V, W, Z

  ""D O W C N"" – ""DOWCN""? No.
  ""D O Z C N"" – ""DOZCN""? No.

This is very restrictive. Let's try ""M"" in position 1:
- M O _ _ _
- N must be in 3,4, or 5
- C must be in 1,4, or 5. If M is in 1, C could be in 4 or 5.
- Possible words:
  ""M O C _ N"" – ""MO C _ N"" – need 4th letter from allowed: D, F, G, H, J, L, V, W, Z

  ""M O C V N"" – ""MOCVN""? No.
  ""M O C W N"" – ""MO C W N""? No.
  ""M O C Z N"" – ""MO C Z N""? No.

This seems impossible. Maybe I missed that N could be in position 3:
- _ O N _ _
- C must be in 1,4, or 5
- D must be in 1,3, or 4 (but 3 is N), so D in 1 or 4
- Possible words:
  ""D O N C L"" – ""DONCL""? No.

This is extremely restrictive. Let's try ""C"" in position 4:

This is impossible. I must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Re-examining the feedback:
Guess 4: nocky -> N(-) O(✓) C(-) K(x) Y(x)
- N(-) means N is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- O(✓) means O is in position 2 (correct).
- C(-) means C is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- K and Y are not in the word.

So:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ _
- N is in word, positions allowed: 2,3,4,5. But position 2 is O, so N must be in 3,4, or 5.
- C is in word, positions allowed: 1,2,4,5. Position 2 is O, so C must be in 1,4, or 5.
- D was (-) in position 5 (from guess 3: bound), meaning D is in word but NOT in position 5, so D must be in 1,3, or 4.

""M O N D C"" – ""MONDC""? No.
""M O N C H"" – ""MONCH""? Yes, ""MONCH"" is a valid word (a type of nut or a variant spelling of monarch).

Check constraints:
- M: allowed
- O: position 2 (✓)
- N: position 3 (allowed)
- C: position 4 (allowed, since C was (-) in position 3)
- H: allowed

This fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 5 distinct common letters. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is a strong candidate because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should help identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, S, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.
- DOES contain O, but not in the 3rd position.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses the known letter O in a different position.
2. Avoids the eliminated letters A, R, S, E.
3. Introduces new common letters to test.

Good remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, H.

A balanced word that satisfies these rules is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are new letters.
- O is moved to position 2 (from position 3 in arose).

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current constraints:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, T
- Letters confirmed IN the word:
  – O in position 2 (from point feedback)
  – N is in the word but not in position 4 (from point feedback)
- Remaining unused common letters: C, U, D, L, G, H, M, Y, B, F, K, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 2nd position.
2. Contains N somewhere other than 4th.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible patterns: _ O _ _ _ with N somewhere else.

Let’s try “BOUND”:
- B, U, D are new letters.
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- N is in position 3 (allowed, since it’s not position 4).
- All letters are still possible (none are in the banned list).

This seems like a good test of B, U, D and a new position for N.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: bound -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(✓) U(x) N(-) D(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word (x): A, R, S, E, P, I, T, B, U  
Letters confirmed IN the word:  
- O is in position 2 (✓ from point and bound)  
- N is in the word but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from point, bound)  
- D is in the word but not in position 5 (from bound)

So N must be in position 1, and the word looks like: N O _ _ _

Letters still allowed: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, V, W, Y, Z  
We need two more distinct letters from this set to fill positions 3 and 4.

A common word that fits is “N O C K Y”.  
Check:  
- N in position 1 (required)  
- O in position 2 (required)  
- C, K, Y are all still allowed and not yet ruled out.

This tests C, K, Y and places N in the only remaining possible position (1).

Let's consolidate everything we know after four guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):
A, R, S, E, P, I, T, B, U, K, Y

Letters that ARE in the word:
- O is in position 2 (✓ from guesses 2, 3, 4)
- N is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from guesses 2, 3, 4)
  – The only remaining spot for N is position 2, but position 2 is already taken by O.
  – This contradiction means our assumption was wrong: N must have been mis-recorded.
  – Rechecking feedback: in guess 4 (nocky) N was marked (-), i.e., in the word but wrong position. But position 1 of nocky is N, so N cannot be in position 1.
  – From all previous guesses:
        – guess 2 (point): N(-) → N not in position 3
        – guess 3 (bound): N(-) → N not in position 3 (already known)
        – guess 4 (nocky): N(-) → N not in position 1
  – Therefore N must be in position 4 or 5, but earlier feedback said N(-) in bound (position 3) and nocky (position 1), so N is allowed in 4 or 5.

Wait, let's re-express the constraints more carefully:

From guess 2 (point): N(-) → N is in word but not in position 3.
From guess 3 (bound): N(-) → N is in word but not in position 3 (same info).
From guess 4 (nocky): N(-) → N is in word but not in position 1.
So N is in word, positions allowed: 2, 4, 5. But position 2 is O (confirmed), so N must be in position 4 or 5.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
C (from guess 4, C was (-) → in word but wrong position, i.e., not position 3)
D (from guess 3, D(-) → in word but not position 5)
Letters left: C, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, V, W, Z

We need a word of form _ O _ _ _ with N in position 4 or 5, and using allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ O _ N _  (N in 4)
- _ O _ _ N  (N in 5)

Let's try ""F O C U N"" – but U is already ruled out.
Next, ""M O C K N"" – K is ruled out.
""H O C K N"" – K ruled out.
""L O C K N"" – K ruled out.
""W O C K N"" – K ruled out.
""G O C K N"" – K ruled out.

Alternative: ""M O D N_"" – D is allowed, but N in 4, need one more letter.
""M O D N_"" – need 5th letter, must be allowed.
""M O D N L"" – is ""MODNL"" a word? No.
""H O D N L"" – ""HODNL""? No.

Another approach: since C was (-) in guess 4 (position 3), C is in word but not position 3. So C could be in 1, 4, or 5.

We have:
- _ O _ _ _
- N must be in 4 or 5
- C must be in 1, 4, or 5 (but 4 or 5 might be taken by N)

Let's try:
- C O _ N _  (C in 1, N in 4)
  Need letters 3 and 5 from allowed set.
  Allowed letters left: F, G, H, J, L, M, V, W, Z
  ""C O M N D"" – D is allowed, but D was (-) in position 5 (from bound), meaning D is in word but not position 5. So D could be in 3 or 4. In this case D would be in 5, which is invalid.
  ""C O G N L"" – ""COGN L""? Not a word.
  ""C O M N L"" – ""COMNL""? No.

Next pattern: _ O C _ N (C in 3 is invalid because C must be in 1,4,5)
Next: _ O _ C N (C in 4)
Need 1st and 3rd letters from allowed.
""F O L C N"" – ""FOLCN""? No.
""M O L C N"" – ""MOLCN""? No.
""H O L C N"" – ""HOLCN""? No.

Next pattern: _ O _ N C (C in 5)
Need 1st and 3rd letters from allowed.
""F O L N C"" – ""FOLNC""? No.
""M O L N C"" – ""MOLNC""? No.
""W O L N C"" – ""WOLNC""? No.

Wait, let's try ""M O L D N"" – but D was (-) in position 5, so D could be in 3 or 4.
""M O D L N"" – ""MODLN""? No.
""H O D L N"" – ""HODLN""? No.

This is tricky. Let's list all possible words fitting _ O _ _ _ with N in 4 or 5 and letters from remaining pool.

Remaining letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, V, W, Z

Possible words:
- ""F O G N D"" – ""FOGND""? No.
- ""M O D N G"" – ""MODNG""? No.
- ""W O D N G"" – ""WODNG""? No.
- ""C O D N G"" – ""CODNG""? No.
- ""L O D N G"" – ""Lodng""? No.

Actually, let's think of real words:
- ""M O C H Y"" – Y is ruled out.
- ""M O D L Y"" – Y ruled out.
- ""M O D G Y"" – Y ruled out.
- ""M O D L N"" – ""MODLN""? Not a word.
- ""M O C K N"" – K ruled out.
- ""M O C N D"" – D is allowed, but D was (-) in position 5, meaning D is in word but not position 5, so D could be in 3 or 4.
  ""M O D N C"" – C in 5 is allowed, D in 3 is allowed.
  ""M O D N C"" – is this a word? No.
- ""M O L N D"" – ""MOLND""? No.
- ""F O L D N"" – ""FOLDN""? No.
- ""W O L D N"" – ""WOLDN""? No.
- ""C O L D N"" – ""COLDN""? No.
- ""G O L D N"" – ""GOLDN""? No.

This seems impossible. Maybe I missed something.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback:
Guess 4: nocky -> N(-) O(✓) C(-) K(x) Y(x)
This means:
- N is in word but not position 1
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- C is in word but not position 3
- K and Y are not in word

So:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ _
- N must be in positions 2,3,4,5. But position 2 is O, so N must be in 3,4, or 5.
- C must be in positions 1,2,4,5. But position 2 is O, so C must be in 1,4, or 5.

Also, D was (-) in position 5 (from guess 3), meaning D is in word but not position 5. So D could be in 1,2,3,4. Position 2 is O, so D could be in 1,3, or 4.

Let's try:
- C in 1, N in 3: C O N _ _
  Need 4th and 5th letters from allowed: D, F, G, H, J, L, M, V, W, Z
  ""C O N D L"" – ""COND L""? No.

  ""C O L N Z"" – ""COLNZ""? No.

- C in 1, N in 5: C O _ _ N

  ""C O V _ N"" – ""COV_N""? No.
  ""C O W _ N"" – ""COW_N""? No.
  ""C O Z _ N"" – ""COZ_N""? No.

This seems impossible. Maybe I missed that N could be in position 2, but position 2 is O. So N cannot be in position 2.

Wait, let's try ""D"" in position 1:
- D O _ _ _
- N must be in 3,4, or 5
- C must be in 1,4, or 5. If D is in 1, C could be in 4 or 5.
- Possible words:
  ""D O C _ N"" – ""DOC_N""? No.
  ""D O _ C N"" – ""D _ C N"" – need 3rd letter from allowed: F, G, H, J, L, M, V, W, Z
  ""D O F C N"" – ""DOFCN""? No.
  ""D O G C N"" – ""DOG C N""? No.
  ""D O H C N"" – ""DOHCN""? No.
  ""D O L C N"" – ""DOLCN""? No.

  ""D O V C N"" – ""DOVCN""? No.
  ""D O W C N"" – ""DOWCN""? No.
  ""D O Z C N"" – ""DOZCN""? No.

This is very restrictive. Let's try ""M"" in position 1:
- M O _ _ _
- N must be in 3,4, or 5
- C must be in 1,4, or 5. If M is in 1, C could be in 4 or 5.
- Possible words:
  ""M O C _ N"" – ""MO C _ N"" – need 4th letter from allowed: D, F, G, H, J, L, V, W, Z
  ""M O C D N"" – ""MOCDN""? No.
  ""M O C F N"" – ""MOCFN""? No.
  ""M O C G N"" – ""MOCGN""? No.
  ""M O C H N"" – ""MOCHN""? No.
  ""M O C L N"" – ""MOC L N""? No.
  ""M O C V N"" – ""MOCVN""? No.
  ""M O C W N"" – ""MO C W N""? No.
  ""M O C Z N"" – ""MO C Z N""? No.

This seems impossible. Maybe I missed that N could be in position 3:
- _ O N _ _
- C must be in 1,4, or 5
- D must be in 1,3, or 4 (but 3 is N), so D in 1 or 4
- Possible words:
  ""D O N C L"" – ""DONCL""? No.
  ""D O N G L"" – ""DONGL""? No.
  ""D O N H L"" – ""DONHL""? No.

  ""M O N L V"" – ""MONLV""? No.
  ""M O N L W"" – ""MONLW""? No.
  ""M O N L Z"" – ""MONLZ""? No.

This is extremely restrictive. Let's try ""C"" in position 4:
- _ O _ C _
- N must be in 3 or 5 (since 1,2,4 are taken or ruled out)
- If N is in 3: _ O N C _

This is impossible. I must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Re-examining the feedback:
Guess 4: nocky -> N(-) O(✓) C(-) K(x) Y(x)
- N(-) means N is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- O(✓) means O is in position 2 (correct).
- C(-) means C is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- K and Y are not in the word.

So:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ _
- N is in word, positions allowed: 2,3,4,5. But position 2 is O, so N must be in 3,4, or 5.
- C is in word, positions allowed: 1,2,4,5. Position 2 is O, so C must be in 1,4, or 5.
- D was (-) in position 5 (from guess 3: bound), meaning D is in word but NOT in position 5, so D must be in 1,3, or 4.

This is impossible. The only remaining possibility is that I missed a word.

""M O N D L"" – ""MONDL""? No.
""M O N D C"" – ""MONDC""? No.
""M O N C H"" – ""MONCH""? Yes, ""MONCH"" is a valid word (a type of nut or a variant spelling of monarch).

Check constraints:
- M: allowed
- O: position 2 (✓)
- N: position 3 (allowed)
- C: position 4 (allowed, since C was (-) in position 3)
- H: allowed

This fits all constraints.

- N(✓) → N is in the word AND in position 3 (now fixed).
- C(-) → C is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Current known facts:
1. Word pattern: _ O N _ _
2. Letters in the word: O (position 2), N (position 3), plus C somewhere (but not position 4).
3. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, T, B, U, K, Y, M, H.
4. Remaining possible letters (from the alphabet minus the eliminated ones): C, D, F, G, J, L, V, W, Z (and possibly others, but these are the common ones left).

Since C must appear somewhere and cannot be in position 4, the only remaining positions for C are 1 or 5.

Let’s explore both cases:

Case 1: C in position 1 → C O N _ _
   Need a valid 5-letter word starting with CON. Possible endings:
   - CONED – but E is eliminated.
   - CONED – E eliminated.
   - CONIC – I is eliminated.
   - CONCH – H is eliminated.
   - CONNY – Y is eliminated.
   - CONNO – O is already used twice (but we don’t know if double O is allowed; the secret word could have it).

   - CONCH – H eliminated.
   - CONNY – Y eliminated.

   Actually, the only common word starting with CON and using remaining letters is CONNO, but that would have two O’s. Since O is already confirmed in position 2, this might be possible if the word allows double letters.
