### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good opening word typically contains common vowels and consonants to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters. Some popular strategic choices include:

- SLATE: covers S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: covers C, R, A, N, E
- ADIEU: covers many vowels but fewer consonants
- AUDIO: similar to ADIEU

Among these, ""CRANE"" is often recommended because it includes very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and can quickly narrow down possibilities. However, ""SLATE"" is also a strong contender due to its coverage of S, L, A, T, E. 

After considering these options, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess because it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters that should give good initial information.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L(-): L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(x): T is not in the word at all.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains S, L, A (each somewhere other than positions 1, 2, 3 respectively).
- The word does NOT contain T or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S, L, A (but not in positions 1, 2, 3).
2. Does NOT include T or E.
3. Uses only valid English words.

Possible positions for S, L, A:
- S cannot be in position 1 → possible positions 2,3,4,5
- L cannot be in position 2 → possible positions 1,3,4,5
- A cannot be in position 3 → possible positions 1,2,4,5

Let’s try to place them:
- Put S in position 4: _ _ _ S _
- Put L in position 1: L _ _ S _
- Put A in position 2: L A _ S _

This gives the pattern: L A _ S _
We need a valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern. Possible letters for position 3: consonants not yet ruled out (no T, E).

Looking at common words: ""L A _ S _"" → ""LASSO"" comes to mind (but O is possible). However, ""LASSO"" has two S's which might be useful, but we already know S is in the word. 

Another option: ""LARIS"" – but R is possible, I is possible, S is already placed. However, ""LARIS"" might not be a common word.

A better common word: ""LAMBS"" – but M and B are possible, but we need to check if this fits all constraints:
- L in position 1 (allowed, since L was only excluded from position 2)
- A in position 2 (allowed, since A was excluded from position 3)
- M in position 3 (new letter, not ruled out)
- B in position 4 (but we need S in position 4) – doesn't fit.

Wait, we need S in position 4, so the pattern must be L A _ S _. 

Looking at valid words: ""LARIS"" seems obscure. ""LADIS"" – no. ""LAMBS"" – no. ""LAPIS"" – yes! ""LAPIS"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning a type of stone or a name.

Check constraints:
- Contains L, A, S – yes.
- S is in position 4 (allowed, since S can't be in position 1).
- L is in position 1 (allowed, since L can't be in position 2).
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since A can't be in position 3).
- Does not contain T or E – yes.

From the new feedback on LAPIS:
- L(-): L is in the word but not in position 1.
- A(✓): A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- P(x): P is not in the word.
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 5.

Summary of what we now know:
1. A is fixed in position 2.
2. The word contains S, L (each in a different position than before) and does NOT contain T, E, P, I.
3. S cannot be in positions 1 or 5.
4. L cannot be in positions 1 or 2.

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ _ with remaining letters to place S and L plus three new letters (from the remaining alphabet excluding T, E, P, I).

Possible positions:
- S must be in 3 or 4.
- L must be in 3, 4, or 5 (but not overlapping with S).

Let’s list possible placements:

Case 1: S in 3, L in 4 or 5
- _ A S L _ or _ A S _ L

Case 2: S in 4, L in 3 or 5
- _ A L S _ or _ A _ S L

We need valid 5-letter words for each case.

Looking at Case 1: _ A S L _
Possible words: ""BASAL"" – but B is allowed, A is already in place, but we need to check letters. However, ""BASAL"" has A in position 2, S in 3, L in 4 – this fits! But we need to check if B is allowed (it hasn't been ruled out). Also, ""CASAL"" – not a valid word. ""DASAL"" – no. ""GASAL"" – no. ""MASAL"" – no. ""NASAL"" – yes! ""NASAL"" fits: N A S A L. But A is already in position 2, and we can have another A. However, we know from feedback that A is in position 2 and is correct, but there's no info on duplicates. ""NASAL"" seems valid.

Case 2: _ A L S _
Possible words: ""BALMS"" – but B, A, L, M, S – M hasn't been ruled out. However, S must be in 4 (allowed) and L in 3 (allowed). ""BALMS"" fits: B A L S M.

Case 2: _ A _ S L
Possible words: ""CALMS"" – C A L M S – fits: C A L M S. But S is in 4, L in 5. This seems valid.

Between these options, ""NASAL"" and ""BALMS"" and ""CALMS"", we need to pick one. ""NASAL"" uses N (new letter) and seems valid. Let's go with ""NASAL"".

Check constraints:
- A in position 2: ✓
- Contains S and L: ✓
- S is in position 3 (allowed, since S can't be 1 or 5)
- L is in position 4 (allowed, since L can't be 1 or 2)
- No T, E, P, I: ✓
- All letters are valid English letters.

""NASAL"" is a good next guess.

- P(x): P is not in the word.
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 5.

Summary of what we now know:
1. A is fixed in position 2.
2. The word contains S, L (each in a different position than before) and does NOT contain T, E, P, I.
3. S cannot be in positions 1 or 5.
4. L cannot be in positions 1 or 2.

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ _ with remaining letters to place S and L plus three new letters (from the remaining alphabet excluding T, E, P, I).

Possible positions:
- S must be in 3 or 4.
- L must be in 3, 4, or 5 (but not overlapping with S).

Let’s list possible placements:

Case 1: S in 3, L in 4 or 5
- _ A S L _ or _ A S _ L

Case 2: S in 4, L in 3 or 5
- _ A L S _ or _ A _ S L

We need valid 5-letter words for each case.

Looking at Case 1: _ A S L _
Possible words: ""BASAL"" – but B is allowed, A is already in place, but we need to check letters. However, ""BASAL"" has A in position 2, S in 3, L in 4 – this fits! But we need to check if B is allowed (it hasn't been ruled out). Also, ""CASAL"" – not a valid word. ""DASAL"" – no. ""GASAL"" – no. ""MASAL"" – no. ""NASAL"" – yes! ""NASAL"" fits: N A S A L. But A is already in position 2, and we can have another A. However, we know from feedback that A is in position 2 and is correct, but there's no info on duplicates. ""NASAL"" seems valid.

Case 2: _ A L S _
Possible words: ""BALMS"" – but B, A, L, M, S – M hasn't been ruled out. However, S must be in 4 (allowed) and L in 3 (allowed). ""BALMS"" fits: B A L S M.

Case 2: _ A _ S L
Possible words: ""CALMS"" – C A L M S – fits: C A L M S. But S is in 4, L in 5. This seems valid.

Between these options, ""NASAL"" and ""BALMS"" and ""CALMS"", we need to pick one. ""NASAL"" uses N (new letter) and seems valid. Let's go with ""NASAL"".

Check constraints:
- A in position 2: ✓
- Contains S and L: ✓
- S is in position 3 (allowed, since S can't be 1 or 5)
- L is in position 4 (allowed, since L can't be 1 or 2)
- No T, E, P, I: ✓
- All letters are valid English letters.

""NASAL"" is a good next guess.",Guess 3: NASAL -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) A(✓) S(✓) A(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
