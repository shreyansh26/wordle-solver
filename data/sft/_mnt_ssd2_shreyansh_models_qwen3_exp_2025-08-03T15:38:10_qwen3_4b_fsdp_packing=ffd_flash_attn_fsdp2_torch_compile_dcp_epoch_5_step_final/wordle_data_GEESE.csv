For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any letters. 

Looking at the common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeats. This will give me maximum information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and E. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the word and in the correct (5th) position.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in S and has an E somewhere in positions 1-4.  
We need a word that:
1. Ends in S (✓ for S in position 5).
2. Contains E somewhere else (positions 1-4).
3. Does not contain A, R, or O.

Good candidate letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A strong second guess should test new common consonants and vowels.  
""ELBOW"" is invalid because it has an O.  
""NESTS"" has an E but also repeats S (and has an S in the 5th spot already).  
""INSET"" has an E but also an I and T.  
""LEMON"" has an O.  
""BEAST"" has an E and S, but A is invalid.  
""HEIST"" has an E and S, no A/R/O.

""HEIST"" seems good: ends in S, has E in position 2, uses new letters H, I, T.

- If E is in position 4: _ _ _ E S. Possible: ""MUSES"" – but U and M allowed, S and E correct. But S is already fixed at 5, so ""MUSES"" has S in 5 and E in 4 – this fits.

5. Allowed letters so far: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus E (in positions 1, 3, 4) and S (fixed at 5).

We need a word that:
- Ends in S.
- Has E in position 1, 3, or 4.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Good candidates:
- If E is in position 1: E _ _ _ S. Possible: EMBER? (but B and M allowed, R not allowed) – invalid.
- If E is in position 3: _ _ E _ S. Possible: BLEED? (but E in 4) – no. Maybe ""BLESS"" – but S repeats and we don’t know if S repeats.
- If E is in position 4: _ _ _ E S. Possible: ""MUSES"" – but U and M allowed, S and E correct. But S is already fixed at 5, so ""MUSES"" has S in 5 and E in 4 – this fits.
- ""DUNES"" – D, U, N, E, S – all letters allowed, E in 4, S in 5.
- ""LUNES"" – but ""LUNES"" is not a common word.
- ""GENES"" – G, E, N, E, S – but E repeats and we don’t know if E repeats.
- ""VENUE"" – ends in E, not S – invalid.

""DUNES"" seems like the best common word fitting all constraints.

Check:
- Ends in S: ✓
- Contains E in position 4: ✓
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, H, I, T): ✓
- All other letters (D, U, N) are allowed.

So I'll guess DUNES.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

1. S is in position 5 (✓ from all three guesses).
2. E is in the word but:
   - NOT in position 2 (from HEIST feedback).
   - NOT in position 4 (from DUNES feedback).
   - NOT in position 5 (from AROSE feedback).
   Therefore E must be in position 1 or 3.
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, H, I, T, D, U, N.
4. So far the pattern looks like:
   - Position 5: S
   - Position 1 or 3: E
   - Positions 2, 4 (and the remaining one of 1 or 3) must be drawn from the still-allowed letters: B, C, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter English word that:
   - Ends in S.
   - Contains E in position 1 or 3.
   - Uses only the still-allowed letters.

Let’s list possibilities:

Case 1: E in position 1 → E _ _ _ S
   - E B _ _ S → EMBER? (needs R, forbidden) – no.
   - E _ _ _ S → E _ _ _ S – common words: E.g., EJECTS (but 6 letters), ELBOWS (O), ECLIPS (I), etc. – none seem valid with allowed letters.

Case 2: E in position 3 → _ _ E _ S
   - _ _ E _ S – possible words:
     - BLEES? – not a word.
     - CLEES? – not a word.
     - GLEES? – not a word.
     - MEEPS? – ends in S, has E in 3, letters M, E, E, P, S – but E repeats and we don’t know if E repeats.
     - LEECH? – ends in H (forbidden).
     - VEEPS? – not common.
     - PEEPS? – P, E, E, P, S – double E, but possible.
     - CEEPS? – not a word.

Looking at allowed letters and common words, “PEEPS” is valid:
   - P, E, E, P, S – all allowed letters (P, E, S are in word; P repeats, S in 5, E in 3).
   - But we don’t have info on repeats yet.

Another candidate: “BEEPS”
   - B, E, E, P, S – same situation.

“KEEPS” – K, E, E, P, S – also possible.

“MEEPS” – not a common word.

“LEEPS” – L, E, E, P, S – valid.

Among these, “LEEPS” is a common enough word and uses allowed letters.

Check constraints:
   - Ends in S: ✓
   - E in position 3: ✓
   - No forbidden letters: ✓
   - Uses allowed letters: L, E, P, S – all allowed.

Therefore, LEEPS is a strong next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any letters. 

Looking at the common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeats. This will give me maximum information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and E. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(✓)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the word and in the correct (5th) position.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in S and has an E somewhere in positions 1-4.  
We need a word that:
1. Ends in S (✓ for S in position 5).
2. Contains E somewhere else (positions 1-4).
3. Does not contain A, R, or O.

Good candidate letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A strong second guess should test new common consonants and vowels.  
""ELBOW"" is invalid because it has an O.  
""NESTS"" has an E but also repeats S (and has an S in the 5th spot already).  
""INSET"" has an E but also an I and T.  
""LEMON"" has an O.  
""BEAST"" has an E and S, but A is invalid.  
""HEIST"" has an E and S, no A/R/O.

""HEIST"" seems good: ends in S, has E in position 2, uses new letters H, I, T.

Another option: ""LEIST"" (but L is common, I, S, T).  
But ""HEIST"" is more common.

I'll go with HEIST.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any letters. 

Looking at the common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeats. This will give me maximum information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and E. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the word and in the correct (5th) position.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in S and has an E somewhere in positions 1-4.  
We need a word that:
1. Ends in S (✓ for S in position 5).
2. Contains E somewhere else (positions 1-4).
3. Does not contain A, R, or O.

Good candidate letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A strong second guess should test new common consonants and vowels.  
""ELBOW"" is invalid because it has an O.  
""NESTS"" has an E but also repeats S (and has an S in the 5th spot already).  
""INSET"" has an E but also an I and T.  
""LEMON"" has an O.  
""BEAST"" has an E and S, but A is invalid.  
""HEIST"" has an E and S, no A/R/O.

""HEIST"" seems good: ends in S, has E in position 2, uses new letters H, I, T.

Another option: ""LEIST"" (but L is common, I, S, T).  
But ""HEIST"" is more common.

I'll go with HEIST.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: HEIST -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(✓) I(x) S(✓) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we know:

1. The word ends in S (position 5 is ✓ for S).
2. E is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5 (from AROSE and HEIST).
3. Letters A, R, O, H, I, T are NOT in the word.
4. Therefore the word must contain E in position 1, 3, or 4.
5. Allowed letters so far: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus E (in positions 1, 3, 4) and S (fixed at 5).

We need a word that:
- Ends in S.
- Has E in position 1, 3, or 4.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Good candidates:
- If E is in position 1: E _ _ _ S. Possible: EMBER? (but B and M allowed, R not allowed) – invalid.
- If E is in position 3: _ _ E _ S. Possible: BLEED? (but E in 4) – no. Maybe ""BLESS"" – but S repeats and we don’t know if S repeats.
- If E is in position 4: _ _ _ E S. Possible: ""MUSES"" – but U and M allowed, S and E correct. But S is already fixed at 5, so ""MUSES"" has S in 5 and E in 4 – this fits.
- ""DUNES"" – D, U, N, E, S – all letters allowed, E in 4, S in 5.
- ""LUNES"" – but ""LUNES"" is not a common word.
- ""GENES"" – G, E, N, E, S – but E repeats and we don’t know if E repeats.
- ""VENUE"" – ends in E, not S – invalid.

""DUNES"" seems like the best common word fitting all constraints.

Check:
- Ends in S: ✓
- Contains E in position 4: ✓
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, H, I, T): ✓
- All other letters (D, U, N) are allowed.

So I'll guess DUNES.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

1. S is in position 5 (✓ from all three guesses).
2. E is in the word but:
   - NOT in position 2 (from HEIST feedback).
   - NOT in position 4 (from DUNES feedback).
   - NOT in position 5 (from AROSE feedback).
   Therefore E must be in position 1 or 3.
3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, H, I, T, D, U, N.
4. So far the pattern looks like:
   - Position 5: S
   - Position 1 or 3: E
   - Positions 2, 4 (and the remaining one of 1 or 3) must be drawn from the still-allowed letters: B, C, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter English word that:
   - Ends in S.
   - Contains E in position 1 or 3.
   - Uses only the still-allowed letters.

Let’s list possibilities:

Case 1: E in position 1 → E _ _ _ S
   - E B _ _ S → EMBER? (needs R, forbidden) – no.
   - E _ _ _ S → E _ _ _ S – common words: E.g., EJECTS (but 6 letters), ELBOWS (O), ECLIPS (I), etc. – none seem valid with allowed letters.

Case 2: E in position 3 → _ _ E _ S
   - _ _ E _ S – possible words:
     - BLEES? – not a word.
     - CLEES? – not a word.
     - GLEES? – not a word.
     - MEEPS? – ends in S, has E in 3, letters M, E, E, P, S – but E repeats and we don’t know if E repeats.
     - LEECH? – ends in H (forbidden).
     - VEEPS? – not common.
     - PEEPS? – P, E, E, P, S – double E, but possible.
     - CEEPS? – not a word.

Looking at allowed letters and common words, “PEEPS” is valid:
   - P, E, E, P, S – all allowed letters (P, E, S are in word; P repeats, S in 5, E in 3).
   - But we don’t have info on repeats yet.

Another candidate: “BEEPS”
   - B, E, E, P, S – same situation.

“KEEPS” – K, E, E, P, S – also possible.

“MEEPS” – not a common word.

“LEEPS” – L, E, E, P, S – valid.

Among these, “LEEPS” is a common enough word and uses allowed letters.

Check constraints:
   - Ends in S: ✓
   - E in position 3: ✓
   - No forbidden letters: ✓
   - Uses allowed letters: L, E, P, S – all allowed.

Therefore, LEEPS is a strong next guess.
