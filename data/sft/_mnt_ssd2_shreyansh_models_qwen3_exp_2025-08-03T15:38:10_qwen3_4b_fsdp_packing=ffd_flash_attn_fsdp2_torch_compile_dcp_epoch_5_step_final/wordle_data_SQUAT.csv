For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use some of these letters.

Common strong starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - but this uses less common letters
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us coverage of 4 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which should provide good feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, I, E
- Letters that ARE in the word (but misplaced): A, S
- A cannot be in position 2, S cannot be in position 4.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S.
2. Does NOT contain R, I, or E.
3. A is not in position 2.
4. S is not in position 4.

Good candidate letters to include: A, S, plus other common consonants (T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.) and vowels (O, U).

Let’s try a word that places A and S in new positions and uses other common letters.  
For example:  
- STAND: contains S and A, but E is excluded (good), and positions are new for A and S.  
  – S is now in position 1 (allowed).  
  – A is now in position 3 (allowed).  
  – Letters used: S, T, A, N, D (none of R, I, E).  

This seems like a strong next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: R, I, E, N, D  
2. Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
   - S is in position 1 (✓)
   - A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3
   - T is in the word but not in position 2
3. So far the word looks like: S _ _ _ _

Possible remaining positions for A: 4 or 5  
Possible remaining positions for T: 3, 4, or 5 (but must avoid conflicts)

We also need two more distinct letters (since we have only S, A, T confirmed).  
Good remaining consonants to try: L, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A is already used).

Let’s build a word that:
- Starts with S
- Places A in position 4 or 5
- Places T somewhere else (not 2)
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Candidate: S P A T _  
- S in 1 ✓  
- A in 3 → but feedback said A is not in 3 → invalid  
Candidate: S _ _ A T  
- S in 1 ✓  
- A in 4 ✓  
- T in 5 ✓  
- Letters: S, _, _, A, T → we need two more letters in positions 2 and 3.  
Available letters (not ruled out): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick common ones.  
Try S P A T _ → but we need a 5th letter.  
Wait, the candidate must be 5 letters total.  
So S _ _ A T is 5 letters: positions 1=S, 4=A, 5=T.  
We still need letters for 2 and 3.  
Let’s try S C A T _ → but again 5th letter needed.  
Let’s try S P A T H → 5 letters: S P A T H  
Check letters: S, P, A, T, H — none are in the forbidden list (R, I, E, N, D).  
Positions:  
- S in 1 ✓  
- A in 3 → but feedback said A is not in 3 → invalid  
Next: S P A C T → invalid (not a word)  
Next: S L A T _ → S L A T _ → SLATE is a word but E is forbidden  
Next: S P A T _ → S P A T H is valid but A is in 3 → invalid  
Next: S _ _ A T → S C A K T → not a word  
Next: S _ _ A T → S H A K T → not a word  
Next: S _ _ A T → S P A C T → not a word  
Next: S _ _ A T → S C A L T → not a word  
Next: S _ _ A T → S C A B T → not a word  
Next: S _ _ A T → S C A M T → not a word  
Next: S _ _ A T → S C A R T → R is forbidden  
Next: S _ _ A T → S C A L T → not a word  
Next: S _ _ A T → S C A P T → not a word  
Next: S _ _ A T → S C A V T → not a word  
Next: S _ _ A T → S C A L T → not a word  

Let me rethink: maybe place A in position 5 instead.  
Word structure: S _ _ _ A  
We know T is in the word but not in position 2.  
Possible positions for T: 3 or 4.  

Candidate: S P A T A → invalid (A repeated)  
Candidate: S P A T _ → S P A T _ → S P A T H has A in 3 → invalid  
Candidate: S _ T _ A → S C T _ A → not a word  
Candidate: S _ _ T A → S C _ T A → S C A T A → invalid  
Candidate: S _ _ T A → S C _ T A → S C U T A → SCUTA is a word (plural of scuta, botanical term).  
Check letters: S, C, U, T, A — none forbidden.  
Positions:  
- S in 1 ✓  
- A in 5 ✓ (allowed)  
- T in 4 ✓ (allowed)  
- C and U are new letters, not yet tested.  

This seems valid.

Another candidate: S _ _ T A → S H _ T A → S H A T A → invalid  
Another: S _ _ T A → S L _ T A → not a word  
Another: S _ _ T A → S P _ T A → S P A T A → invalid  
Another: S _ _ T A → S B _ T A → not a word  

SCUTA seems the best.

But let me check if there’s a more common word.  
Alternative: S _ _ _ A with T in 3: S _ T _ A → S C T _ A → not a word  
Alternative: S _ _ _ A with T in 4: S _ _ T A → S C _ T A → SCUTA is valid.  

Thus, I’ll go with SCUTA.

Let me rethink: maybe place A in position 5 instead.  
Word structure: S _ _ _ A  
We know T is in the word but not in position 2.  
Possible positions for T: 3 or 4.  

Candidate: S P A T A → invalid (A repeated)  
Candidate: S P A T _ → S P A T _ → S P A T H has A in 3 → invalid  
Candidate: S _ T _ A → S C T _ A → not a word  
Candidate: S _ _ T A → S C _ T A → S C A T A → invalid  
Candidate: S _ _ T A → S C _ T A → S C U T A → SCUTA is a word (plural of scuta, botanical term).  
Check letters: S, C, U, T, A — none forbidden.  
Positions:  
- S in 1 ✓  
- A in 5 ✓ (allowed)  
- T in 4 ✓ (allowed)  
- C and U are new letters, not yet tested.  

This seems valid.

Another candidate: S _ _ T A → S H _ T A → S H A T A → invalid  
Another: S _ _ T A → S L _ T A → not a word  
Another: S _ _ T A → S P _ T A → S P A T A → invalid  
Another: S _ _ T A → S B _ T A → not a word  

SCUTA seems the best.

But let me check if there’s a more common word.  
Alternative: S _ _ _ A with T in 3: S _ T _ A → S C T _ A → not a word  
Alternative: S _ _ _ A with T in 4: S _ _ T A → S C _ T A → SCUTA is valid.  

Thus, I’ll go with SCUTA.",Guess 3: SCUTA -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) U(✓) T(-) A(-),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use some of these letters.

Common strong starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - but this uses less common letters
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us coverage of 4 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which should provide good feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, I, E
- Letters that ARE in the word (but misplaced): A, S
- A cannot be in position 2, S cannot be in position 4.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S.
2. Does NOT contain R, I, or E.
3. A is not in position 2.
4. S is not in position 4.

Good candidate letters to include: A, S, plus other common consonants (T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.) and vowels (O, U).

Let’s try a word that places A and S in new positions and uses other common letters.  
For example:  
- STAND: contains S and A, but E is excluded (good), and positions are new for A and S.  
  – S is now in position 1 (allowed).  
  – A is now in position 3 (allowed).  
  – Letters used: S, T, A, N, D (none of R, I, E).  

This seems like a strong next guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STAND -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) A(-) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: R, I, E, N, D  
2. Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
   - S is in position 1 (✓)
   - A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3
   - T is in the word but not in position 2
3. So far the word looks like: S _ _ _ _

Possible remaining positions for A: 4 or 5  
Possible remaining positions for T: 3, 4, or 5 (but must avoid conflicts)

We also need two more distinct letters (since we have only S, A, T confirmed).  
Good remaining consonants to try: L, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A is already used).

Let’s build a word that:
- Starts with S
- Places A in position 4 or 5
- Places T somewhere else (not 2)
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Candidate: S P A T _  
- S in 1 ✓  
- A in 3 → but feedback said A is not in 3 → invalid  
Candidate: S _ _ A T  
- S in 1 ✓  
- A in 4 ✓  
- T in 5 ✓  
- Letters: S, _, _, A, T → we need two more letters in positions 2 and 3.  
Available letters (not ruled out): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick common ones.  
Try S P A T _ → but we need a 5th letter.  
Wait, the candidate must be 5 letters total.  
So S _ _ A T is 5 letters: positions 1=S, 4=A, 5=T.  
We still need letters for 2 and 3.  
Let’s try S C A T _ → but again 5th letter needed.  
Let’s try S P A T H → 5 letters: S P A T H  
Check letters: S, P, A, T, H — none are in the forbidden list (R, I, E, N, D).  
Positions:  
- S in 1 ✓  
- A in 3 → but feedback said A is not in 3 → invalid  
Next: S P A C T → invalid (not a word)  
Next: S L A T _ → S L A T _ → SLATE is a word but E is forbidden  
Next: S P A T _ → S P A T H is valid but A is in 3 → invalid  
Next: S _ _ A T → S C A K T → not a word  
Next: S _ _ A T → S H A K T → not a word  
Next: S _ _ A T → S P A C T → not a word  
Next: S _ _ A T → S C A L T → not a word  
Next: S _ _ A T → S C A B T → not a word  
Next: S _ _ A T → S C A M T → not a word  
Next: S _ _ A T → S C A R T → R is forbidden  
Next: S _ _ A T → S C A L T → not a word  
Next: S _ _ A T → S C A P T → not a word  
Next: S _ _ A T → S C A V T → not a word  
Next: S _ _ A T → S C A L T → not a word  

Let me rethink: maybe place A in position 5 instead.  
Word structure: S _ _ _ A  
We know T is in the word but not in position 2.  
Possible positions for T: 3 or 4.  

Candidate: S P A T A → invalid (A repeated)  
Candidate: S P A T _ → S P A T _ → S P A T H has A in 3 → invalid  
Candidate: S _ T _ A → S C T _ A → not a word  
Candidate: S _ _ T A → S C _ T A → S C A T A → invalid  
Candidate: S _ _ T A → S C _ T A → S C U T A → SCUTA is a word (plural of scuta, botanical term).  
Check letters: S, C, U, T, A — none forbidden.  
Positions:  
- S in 1 ✓  
- A in 5 ✓ (allowed)  
- T in 4 ✓ (allowed)  
- C and U are new letters, not yet tested.  

This seems valid.

Another candidate: S _ _ T A → S H _ T A → S H A T A → invalid  
Another: S _ _ T A → S L _ T A → not a word  
Another: S _ _ T A → S P _ T A → S P A T A → invalid  
Another: S _ _ T A → S B _ T A → not a word  

SCUTA seems the best.

But let me check if there’s a more common word.  
Alternative: S _ _ _ A with T in 3: S _ T _ A → S C T _ A → not a word  
Alternative: S _ _ _ A with T in 4: S _ _ T A → S C _ T A → SCUTA is valid.  

Thus, I’ll go with SCUTA.

From the new feedback on SCUTA:

1. S(✓) – S is still in position 1.
2. C(x) – C is NOT in the word.
3. U(✓) – U is in the word and in position 3.
4. T(-) – T is in the word but NOT in position 4.
5. A(-) – A is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Combining all information so far:

- Word pattern: S _ U _ _
- Letters definitely in the word: S (pos 1), U (pos 3), T, A
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, I, E, N, D, C
- A cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5
- T cannot be in positions 2, 4

Thus:
- A must be in position 4
- T must be in position 2 or 5
- Position 5 must be a new letter (not yet ruled out)

Current pattern: S T U A _  or  S _ U A T

Letters still available (not ruled out): B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits one of the patterns above.

Check S T U A _ :
- STUAL – not a word
- STUAN – not a word
- STUAR – R is out
- STUAX – not a word

Check S _ U A T :
- S B U A T – not a word
- S F U A T – not a word
- S G U A T – not a word
- S H U A T – not a word
- S L U A T – SLUAT – not a word
- S M U A T – not a word
- S O U A T – not a word
- S P U A T – not a word
- S V U A T – not a word

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me reconsider the placement of T.

Wait, T cannot be in position 4 (from SCUTA feedback), and from STAND it cannot be in position 2. Thus T must be in position 5.

Therefore the word must be: S _ U A T

Looking for valid English words of the form S ? U A T.

Possible words:
- S L U A T – not valid
- S M U A T – not valid
- S H U A T – not valid
- S B U A T – not valid
- S P U A T – not valid
- S G U A T – not valid
- S K U A T – not valid
- S F U A T – not valid
- S V U A T – not valid
- S W U A T – not valid
- S Y U A T – not valid
- S Z U A T – not valid

None of these are valid English words. This suggests I may have made an error in assuming A must be in position 4.

Re-examining the constraints on A:
- From RAISE: A is in word but not position 2
- From STAND: A is in word but not position 3
- From SCUTA: A is in word but not position 5

Thus A can only be in position 1 or 4. But position 1 is S, so A must be in position 4.

This leaves T to be in position 2 or 5 (cannot be 2 from STAND, so T must be in 5).

Thus the word must be S _ U A T.

But as I found, no valid word fits S ? U A T. This implies I may have missed a possibility.

Wait, let me check if there are any other positions for T. From STAND, T is in word but not position 2. From SCUTA, T is in word but not position 4. Thus T can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5. But position 1 is S, position 3 is U, so T must be in position 5.

Thus the structure is indeed S _ U A T.

Looking up valid 5-letter words: the only common word that fits is ""SQUAT"" – but C is ruled out, and we have U in position 3.

""SQUAT"" would be S Q U A T. Check letters:
- S ✓
- Q – not yet ruled out
- U ✓
- A – allowed in position 4
- T – allowed in position 5

This fits all constraints and is a valid word.

Therefore, the next guess is SQUAT.

<guess>SQUAT</guess>",SQUAT,"From the new feedback on SCUTA:

1. S(✓) – S is still in position 1.
2. C(x) – C is NOT in the word.
3. U(✓) – U is in the word and in position 3.
4. T(-) – T is in the word but NOT in position 4.
5. A(-) – A is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Combining all information so far:

- Word pattern: S _ U _ _
- Letters definitely in the word: S (pos 1), U (pos 3), T, A
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, I, E, N, D, C
- A cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5

Thus:
- A must be in position 4
- T must be in position 2 or 5
- Position 5 must be a new letter (not yet ruled out)

Current pattern: S T U A _  or  S _ U A T

Letters still available (not ruled out): B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits one of the patterns above.

Check S T U A _ :
- STUAL – not a word

Check S _ U A T :
- S B U A T – not a word

- S L U A T – SLUAT – not a word
- S M U A T – not a word
- S O U A T – not a word
- S P U A T – not a word
- S V U A T – not a word

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me reconsider the placement of T.

Wait, T cannot be in position 4 (from SCUTA feedback), and from STAND it cannot be in position 2. Thus T must be in position 5.

Therefore the word must be: S _ U A T

Looking for valid English words of the form S ? U A T.

Possible words:
- S L U A T – not valid
- S M U A T – not valid
- S H U A T – not valid
- S B U A T – not valid
- S P U A T – not valid
- S G U A T – not valid

- S F U A T – not valid
- S V U A T – not valid
- S W U A T – not valid
- S Y U A T – not valid
- S Z U A T – not valid

None of these are valid English words. This suggests I may have made an error in assuming A must be in position 4.

Re-examining the constraints on A:
- From RAISE: A is in word but not position 2
- From STAND: A is in word but not position 3
- From SCUTA: A is in word but not position 5

Thus A can only be in position 1 or 4. But position 1 is S, so A must be in position 4.

This leaves T to be in position 2 or 5 (cannot be 2 from STAND, so T must be in 5).

Thus the word must be S _ U A T.

But as I found, no valid word fits S ? U A T. This implies I may have missed a possibility.

Wait, let me check if there are any other positions for T. From STAND, T is in word but not position 2. From SCUTA, T is in word but not position 4. Thus T can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5. But position 1 is S, position 3 is U, so T must be in position 5.

Thus the structure is indeed S _ U A T.

Looking up valid 5-letter words: the only common word that fits is ""SQUAT"" – but C is ruled out, and we have U in position 3.

""SQUAT"" would be S Q U A T. Check letters:
- S ✓
- Q – not yet ruled out
- U ✓
- A – allowed in position 4
- T – allowed in position 5

This fits all constraints and is a valid word.

Therefore, the next guess is SQUAT.",Guess 4: SQUAT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) Q(✓) U(✓) A(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
