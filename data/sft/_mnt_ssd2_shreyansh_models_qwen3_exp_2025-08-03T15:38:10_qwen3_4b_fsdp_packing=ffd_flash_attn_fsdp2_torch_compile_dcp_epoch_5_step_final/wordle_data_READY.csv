### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use some of these letters.

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (contains A, R, I, S, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

Among these, ""ARISE"" is particularly good because it contains 4 of the top 5 most common letters (A, R, I, S, E) and covers both vowels and common consonants. This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on “arise”:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2  
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word  
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word  
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5  

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, E (but not in the positions guessed)  
- Does NOT contain I or S  

Next step: pick a word that re-uses A, R, E in new positions and introduces other common consonants.  
A good candidate is “REACT”:  
- R in position 1 (was position 2 before)  
- E in position 2 (was position 5 before)  
- A in position 3 (was position 1 before)  
- C and T are common consonants we haven’t tested yet.  

This maximizes new information while respecting the constraints.
