For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting letters include S, T, A, R, N, L, and common vowels like A, E, I, O, U. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these letters to maximize information gain.

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - heavy on vowels
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O) - very vowel-heavy
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a balanced choice covering several common consonants and vowels.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S is present, just not in slot 1)
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: L, A, T, E
- We definitely have an S somewhere in positions 2-5
- We still need to find 4 other letters, none of which are L/A/T/E

Good next step is to test new common consonants and vowels. Since A and E are out, we can try I, O, U plus common consonants like R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.

A balanced guess that places S in a new spot and introduces fresh letters is “SOUND”:
- S moves to position 1 (but we already know S is in the word, so this tests if S is in position 1 again—maybe not optimal)
Actually, since S was marked “-” (wrong position) in SLATE, it cannot be in position 1. So we should try S in positions 2-5.

Let’s pick “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D are all new letters
- S is not included, but we already know S is in the word, so we need to place it later
However, we need to cover S placement.

Better choice: “SURGE” – but E is already ruled out.
“SPURN” – P and U are new, N is new, S is in position 1 (but S can’t be there)
“CRISP” – C, R, I, S, P – S is in position 4 (valid), introduces C, R, I, P
But we might want to test more vowels.

Another option: “SHORN” – H, O, R, N, S – S is in position 5 (valid), tests H, O, R, N
But O is a vowel we haven’t tested yet.

“SHORN” seems good because:
- S is in position 5 (allowed)
- H, O, R, N are all new letters
- Tests the vowel O and common consonants H, R, N

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, R  
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: S, O, N  
   – S was marked “-” in both guesses, so it cannot be in position 1 (SLATE) or 5 (SHORN).  
   – O was marked “-” in SHORN, so it cannot be in position 3.  
   – N was marked “-” in SHORN, so it cannot be in position 5.

We still need a valid 5-letter word that uses only the remaining unused letters and places S, O, N in permissible slots.

Available letters (excluding the ruled-out ones):  
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: I, U, (O is already known to be present)  
Plus the confirmed letters S, N (and O).

We must include S, O, N and place them so:
- S can be in positions 2, 3, or 4  
- O can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5  
- N can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4  

Let’s try to build a word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new letters to narrow things down.

A good candidate is “SONIC”:
- S is in position 1 – but this violates our constraint that S cannot be in position 1.  
So SONIC is invalid.

Next candidate: “COINS” – but S is in position 5, which is forbidden.

Next: “SCION” – S is in position 1 again. Forbidden.

Next: “NOISY” – S is in position 3 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), N in position 1 (allowed).  
But we need to check if all letters are unused or confirmed:
- N, O, I, S, Y: N, O, S are confirmed; I and Y are new.  
Positions:
- N (1) – allowed  
- O (2) – allowed  
- I (3) – new  
- S (3) – wait, S is in position 3 here, which is allowed (positions 2,3,4).  
- Y (5) – new  
But we need to ensure S, O, N are all present. In NOISY, they are all present and in allowed positions.  
This seems valid.

Another candidate: “SONIC” already rejected.  
“OSCIN” – not a valid word.  
“CONIS” – not valid.  
“NOISY” appears to be the only common valid word meeting constraints.

Let’s verify NOISY:
- Letters: N, O, I, S, Y  
  – N, O, S are confirmed in the word.  
  – I and Y are new letters to test.  
- Positions:  
  – N in 1: allowed (not ruled out)  
  – O in 2: allowed (not ruled out)  
  – S in 3: allowed (positions 2,3,4)  
  – I and Y are new.  

Therefore, NOISY is a valid next guess.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting letters include S, T, A, R, N, L, and common vowels like A, E, I, O, U. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these letters to maximize information gain.

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - heavy on vowels
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O) - very vowel-heavy
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a balanced choice covering several common consonants and vowels.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S is present, just not in slot 1)
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: L, A, T, E
- We definitely have an S somewhere in positions 2-5
- We still need to find 4 other letters, none of which are L/A/T/E

Good next step is to test new common consonants and vowels. Since A and E are out, we can try I, O, U plus common consonants like R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.

A balanced guess that places S in a new spot and introduces fresh letters is “SOUND”:
- S moves to position 1 (but we already know S is in the word, so this tests if S is in position 1 again—maybe not optimal)
Actually, since S was marked “-” (wrong position) in SLATE, it cannot be in position 1. So we should try S in positions 2-5.

Let’s pick “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D are all new letters
- S is not included, but we already know S is in the word, so we need to place it later
However, we need to cover S placement.

Better choice: “SURGE” – but E is already ruled out.
“SPURN” – P and U are new, N is new, S is in position 1 (but S can’t be there)
“CRISP” – C, R, I, S, P – S is in position 4 (valid), introduces C, R, I, P
But we might want to test more vowels.

Another option: “SHORN” – H, O, R, N, S – S is in position 5 (valid), tests H, O, R, N
But O is a vowel we haven’t tested yet.

“SHORN” seems good because:
- S is in position 5 (allowed)
- H, O, R, N are all new letters
- Tests the vowel O and common consonants H, R, N

Let’s go with SHORN.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, R  
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: S, O, N  
   – S was marked “-” in both guesses, so it cannot be in position 1 (SLATE) or 5 (SHORN).  
   – O was marked “-” in SHORN, so it cannot be in position 3.  
   – N was marked “-” in SHORN, so it cannot be in position 5.

We still need a valid 5-letter word that uses only the remaining unused letters and places S, O, N in permissible slots.

Available letters (excluding the ruled-out ones):  
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: I, U, (O is already known to be present)  
Plus the confirmed letters S, N (and O).

We must include S, O, N and place them so:
- S can be in positions 2, 3, or 4  
- O can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5  
- N can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4  

Let’s try to build a word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new letters to narrow things down.

A good candidate is “SONIC”:
- S is in position 1 – but this violates our constraint that S cannot be in position 1.  
So SONIC is invalid.

Next candidate: “COINS” – but S is in position 5, which is forbidden.

Next: “SCION” – S is in position 1 again. Forbidden.

Next: “NOISY” – S is in position 3 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), N in position 1 (allowed).  
But we need to check if all letters are unused or confirmed:
- N, O, I, S, Y: N, O, S are confirmed; I and Y are new.  
Positions:
- N (1) – allowed  
- O (2) – allowed  
- I (3) – new  
- S (3) – wait, S is in position 3 here, which is allowed (positions 2,3,4).  
- Y (5) – new  
But we need to ensure S, O, N are all present. In NOISY, they are all present and in allowed positions.  
This seems valid.

Another candidate: “SONIC” already rejected.  
“OSCIN” – not a valid word.  
“CONIS” – not valid.  
“NOISY” appears to be the only common valid word meeting constraints.

Let’s verify NOISY:
- Letters: N, O, I, S, Y  
  – N, O, S are confirmed in the word.  
  – I and Y are new letters to test.  
- Positions:  
  – N in 1: allowed (not ruled out)  
  – O in 2: allowed (not ruled out)  
  – S in 3: allowed (positions 2,3,4)  
  – I and Y are new.  

Therefore, NOISY is a valid next guess.

Let's update what we now know after the three guesses.

Letters we have tried so far:

Letters ruled out (x or - in both positions):
L, A, T, E, H, R, I, Y

Letters confirmed to be in the word (✓ or - in at least one position):
S, O, N

Exact position information:
- O is in the word and is in position 2 (✓ in NOISY at position 2).
- S is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 5 (from SLATE and SHORN feedback).
  Therefore S must be in position 2 or 4.  But position 2 is already taken by O, so S must be in position 4.
- N is in the word but not in positions 1, 5 (from SHORN and NOISY feedback).
  Therefore N must be in position 2, 3, or 4.  Position 2 is O, position 4 is S, so N must be in position 3.

So the word structure is:
_  O  N  S  _

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 5.  Available letters (not yet ruled out):
B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need to pick two different letters from this list to fill positions 1 and 5.

Possible valid words:
- BONDS

- MONGS

- SOUND (invalid, U is available but D is available)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting letters include S, T, A, R, N, L, and common vowels like A, E, I, O, U. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these letters to maximize information gain.

Some popular first guesses include:

- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - heavy on vowels

But we might want to test more vowels.

Another option: “SHORN” – H, O, R, N, S – S is in position 5 (valid), tests H, O, R, N
But O is a vowel we haven’t tested yet.

“SHORN” seems good because:

   – S was marked “-” in both guesses, so it cannot be in position 1 (SLATE) or 5 (SHORN).  
   – O was marked “-” in SHORN, so it cannot be in position 3.  
   – N was marked “-” in SHORN, so it cannot be in position 5.

We still need a valid 5-letter word that uses only the remaining unused letters and places S, O, N in permissible slots.

Available letters (excluding the ruled-out ones):  
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

- O can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5  
- N can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4  

Let’s try to build a word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new letters to narrow things down.

A good candidate is “SONIC”:
- S is in position 1 – but this violates our constraint that S cannot be in position 1.  
So SONIC is invalid.

Next candidate: “COINS” – but S is in position 5, which is forbidden.

Next: “SCION” – S is in position 1 again. Forbidden.

Next: “NOISY” – S is in position 3 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), N in position 1 (allowed).  
But we need to check if all letters are unused or confirmed:
- N, O, I, S, Y: N, O, S are confirmed; I and Y are new.  
Positions:
- N (1) – allowed  
- O (2) – allowed  
- I (3) – new  
- S (3) – wait, S is in position 3 here, which is allowed (positions 2,3,4).  
- Y (5) – new  
But we need to ensure S, O, N are all present. In NOISY, they are all present and in allowed positions.  
This seems valid.

Another candidate: “SONIC” already rejected.  
“OSCIN” – not a valid word.  
“CONIS” – not valid.  
“NOISY” appears to be the only common valid word meeting constraints.

Let’s verify NOISY:
- Letters: N, O, I, S, Y  
  – N, O, S are confirmed in the word.  
  – I and Y are new letters to test.  
- Positions:  
  – N in 1: allowed (not ruled out)  
  – O in 2: allowed (not ruled out)

  Therefore N must be in position 2, 3, or 4.  Position 2 is O, position 4 is S, so N must be in position 3.

So the word structure is:
_  O  N  S  _

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 5.  Available letters (not yet ruled out):
B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need to pick two different letters from this list to fill positions 1 and 5.

Possible valid words:
- BONDS
- CONDS
- FONDS
- GONDS (invalid)
- MONGS
- PONGS
- SOUND (invalid, U is available but D is available)
Wait, let me think of real words.

Real words fitting _ O N S _:
- SOUND: U is available, D is available.  This is a valid word.
- BONDS: B and D are available.
- MONGS: M and G are available, but MONGS is a valid word.
- PONGS: P and G are available, but PONGS is valid.
- CONDS: C and D are available, but CONDS is not a standard word.
- FONDS: F and D are available, but FONDS is valid.

Among these, SOUND is the most common word.  Let's check if it fits:
SOUND:
- S is in position 4 (✓ with our deduction)
- O is in position 2 (✓ with our deduction)
- U is new
- N is in position 3 (✓ with our deduction)
- D is new

This seems perfect.

Let's update what we now know after four guesses.

Letters tried so far:
S, L, A, T, E, H, O, R, N, I, Y, U, D

Letters ruled out (x or - in both positions):
L, A, T, E, H, R, I, Y, D

Letters confirmed to be in the word (✓ or - in at least one position):
O (✓ in position 2 in NOISY and SOUND)
S (must be in word, but positions 1,3,4,5 have been ruled out for S)
N (must be in word, but positions 1,3,5 ruled out from previous feedback)

Exact deductions:
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- S is in the word but cannot be in positions 1,3,4,5 (from SLATE, SHORN, SOUND).  
  The only remaining position for S is position 2, but position 2 is already O.  
  This contradiction implies our earlier assumption was incomplete.

Wait, let's re-examine S placement carefully:

From SLATE: S(-) → not position 1  
From SHORN: S(-) → not position 1 (redundant)  
From SOUND: S(-) → not position 1 (redundant)  

We never got a ✓ for S, so S is definitely in the word but we still don't know its exact position.  
However, positions 2 and 4 are now occupied by O and N respectively (from SOUND feedback: N(-) means N is not in position 5, but we still don't know if it's in 2 or 3 or 4).  

Let me re-summarize:

Confirmed letters: O (position 2), S, N  
Ruled out positions:
- S: not 1, not 3, not 4, not 5 → impossible (all positions ruled out).  
This means our earlier interpretation was wrong: the (-) only tells us it's in the word but not in that specific position, not necessarily that it's in the word at all.

But we have S(-) in SLATE (position 1), S(-) in SHORN (position 1), and S(-) in SOUND (position 1).  
This shows S is in the word but not in position 1.  
Positions 2,3,4,5 for S have not been tested yet.

Similarly, N:
- SHORN: N(-) → not position 5  
- NOISY: N(-) → not position 1  
- SOUND: N(-) → not position 4  

So N is in the word but not in positions 1,4,5.  
Thus N must be in position 2 or 3.  
But position 2 is O, so N must be in position 3.

Structure so far: _ O N _ _

S must be in positions 2,3,4,5.  
Position 2 is O, position 3 is N, so S must be in position 4 or 5.

Letters remaining to place: positions 1 and 5 (or 4 if S is in 5).

Available letters (not yet ruled out):
B, C, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need two different letters for the two blanks.

Possible words:
- B O N S _ → BONSE? (invalid)

Real words:

- CONED (invalid, D ruled out)
- FONED (invalid)
- MONKS (S in 5, N in 3, O in 2, M and K new)
- PONGS (S in 5, N in 3, O in 2, P and G new)
- BONKS (S in 5, N in 3, O in 2, B and K new)

MONKS seems valid:
- M (new), O (position 2 ✓), N (position 3 ✓), K (new), S (position 5)

This fits all constraints.

</think>

From the feedback:
- O is locked in position 2.
- N must be in position 3 (since positions 1,4,5 have been ruled out for N).
- S must be in the word but not in positions 1,3,4,5 (from previous (-) marks).  
  However, position 3 is N, so S must be in position 2 or 5.  
  Position 2 is O, so S must be in position 5.

Thus the structure is: _ O N _ S

Available letters for positions 1 and 4: B, C, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting letters include S, T, A, R, N, L, and common vowels like A, E, I, O, U. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these letters to maximize information gain.

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - heavy on vowels
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O) - very vowel-heavy
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a balanced choice covering several common consonants and vowels.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S is present, just not in slot 1)
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: L, A, T, E
- We definitely have an S somewhere in positions 2-5
- We still need to find 4 other letters, none of which are L/A/T/E

Good next step is to test new common consonants and vowels. Since A and E are out, we can try I, O, U plus common consonants like R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.

A balanced guess that places S in a new spot and introduces fresh letters is “SOUND”:
- S moves to position 1 (but we already know S is in the word, so this tests if S is in position 1 again—maybe not optimal)
Actually, since S was marked “-” (wrong position) in SLATE, it cannot be in position 1. So we should try S in positions 2-5.

Let’s pick “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D are all new letters
- S is not included, but we already know S is in the word, so we need to place it later
However, we need to cover S placement.

Better choice: “SURGE” – but E is already ruled out.
“SPURN” – P and U are new, N is new, S is in position 1 (but S can’t be there)
“CRISP” – C, R, I, S, P – S is in position 4 (valid), introduces C, R, I, P
But we might want to test more vowels.

Another option: “SHORN” – H, O, R, N, S – S is in position 5 (valid), tests H, O, R, N
But O is a vowel we haven’t tested yet.

“SHORN” seems good because:
- S is in position 5 (allowed)
- H, O, R, N are all new letters
- Tests the vowel O and common consonants H, R, N

Let’s go with SHORN.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, R  
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: S, O, N  
   – S was marked “-” in both guesses, so it cannot be in position 1 (SLATE) or 5 (SHORN).  
   – O was marked “-” in SHORN, so it cannot be in position 3.  
   – N was marked “-” in SHORN, so it cannot be in position 5.

We still need a valid 5-letter word that uses only the remaining unused letters and places S, O, N in permissible slots.

Available letters (excluding the ruled-out ones):  
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: I, U, (O is already known to be present)  
Plus the confirmed letters S, N (and O).

We must include S, O, N and place them so:
- S can be in positions 2, 3, or 4  
- O can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5  
- N can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4  

Let’s try to build a word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new letters to narrow things down.

A good candidate is “SONIC”:
- S is in position 1 – but this violates our constraint that S cannot be in position 1.  
So SONIC is invalid.

Next candidate: “COINS” – but S is in position 5, which is forbidden.

Next: “SCION” – S is in position 1 again. Forbidden.

Next: “NOISY” – S is in position 3 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), N in position 1 (allowed).  
But we need to check if all letters are unused or confirmed:
- N, O, I, S, Y: N, O, S are confirmed; I and Y are new.  
Positions:
- N (1) – allowed  
- O (2) – allowed  
- I (3) – new  
- S (3) – wait, S is in position 3 here, which is allowed (positions 2,3,4).  
- Y (5) – new  
But we need to ensure S, O, N are all present. In NOISY, they are all present and in allowed positions.  
This seems valid.

Another candidate: “SONIC” already rejected.  
“OSCIN” – not a valid word.  
“CONIS” – not valid.  
“NOISY” appears to be the only common valid word meeting constraints.

Let’s verify NOISY:
- Letters: N, O, I, S, Y  
  – N, O, S are confirmed in the word.  
  – I and Y are new letters to test.  
- Positions:  
  – N in 1: allowed (not ruled out)  
  – O in 2: allowed (not ruled out)  
  – S in 3: allowed (positions 2,3,4)  
  – I and Y are new.  

Therefore, NOISY is a valid next guess.

Let's update what we now know after the three guesses.

Letters we have tried so far:
S, L, A, T, E, H, O, R, N, I, Y

Letters ruled out (x or - in both positions):
L, A, T, E, H, R, I, Y

Letters confirmed to be in the word (✓ or - in at least one position):
S, O, N

Exact position information:
- O is in the word and is in position 2 (✓ in NOISY at position 2).
- S is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 5 (from SLATE and SHORN feedback).
  Therefore S must be in position 2 or 4.  But position 2 is already taken by O, so S must be in position 4.
- N is in the word but not in positions 1, 5 (from SHORN and NOISY feedback).
  Therefore N must be in position 2, 3, or 4.  Position 2 is O, position 4 is S, so N must be in position 3.

So the word structure is:
_  O  N  S  _

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 5.  Available letters (not yet ruled out):
B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need to pick two different letters from this list to fill positions 1 and 5.

Possible valid words:
- BONDS
- CONDS
- FONDS
- GONDS (invalid)
- MONGS
- PONGS
- SOUND (invalid, U is available but D is available)
Wait, let me think of real words.

Real words fitting _ O N S _:
- SOUND: U is available, D is available.  This is a valid word.
- BONDS: B and D are available.
- MONGS: M and G are available, but MONGS is a valid word.
- PONGS: P and G are available, but PONGS is valid.
- CONDS: C and D are available, but CONDS is not a standard word.
- FONDS: F and D are available, but FONDS is valid.

Among these, SOUND is the most common word.  Let's check if it fits:
SOUND:
- S is in position 4 (✓ with our deduction)
- O is in position 2 (✓ with our deduction)
- U is new
- N is in position 3 (✓ with our deduction)
- D is new

This seems perfect.

Let's update what we now know after four guesses.

Letters tried so far:
S, L, A, T, E, H, O, R, N, I, Y, U, D

Letters ruled out (x or - in both positions):
L, A, T, E, H, R, I, Y, D

Letters confirmed to be in the word (✓ or - in at least one position):
O (✓ in position 2 in NOISY and SOUND)
S (must be in word, but positions 1,3,4,5 have been ruled out for S)
N (must be in word, but positions 1,3,5 ruled out from previous feedback)

Exact deductions:
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- S is in the word but cannot be in positions 1,3,4,5 (from SLATE, SHORN, SOUND).  
  The only remaining position for S is position 2, but position 2 is already O.  
  This contradiction implies our earlier assumption was incomplete.

Wait, let's re-examine S placement carefully:

From SLATE: S(-) → not position 1  
From SHORN: S(-) → not position 1 (redundant)  
From SOUND: S(-) → not position 1 (redundant)  

We never got a ✓ for S, so S is definitely in the word but we still don't know its exact position.  
However, positions 2 and 4 are now occupied by O and N respectively (from SOUND feedback: N(-) means N is not in position 5, but we still don't know if it's in 2 or 3 or 4).  

Let me re-summarize:

Confirmed letters: O (position 2), S, N  
Ruled out positions:
- S: not 1, not 3, not 4, not 5 → impossible (all positions ruled out).  
This means our earlier interpretation was wrong: the (-) only tells us it's in the word but not in that specific position, not necessarily that it's in the word at all.

But we have S(-) in SLATE (position 1), S(-) in SHORN (position 1), and S(-) in SOUND (position 1).  
This shows S is in the word but not in position 1.  
Positions 2,3,4,5 for S have not been tested yet.

Similarly, N:
- SHORN: N(-) → not position 5  
- NOISY: N(-) → not position 1  
- SOUND: N(-) → not position 4  

So N is in the word but not in positions 1,4,5.  
Thus N must be in position 2 or 3.  
But position 2 is O, so N must be in position 3.

Structure so far: _ O N _ _

S must be in positions 2,3,4,5.  
Position 2 is O, position 3 is N, so S must be in position 4 or 5.

Letters remaining to place: positions 1 and 5 (or 4 if S is in 5).

Available letters (not yet ruled out):
B, C, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need two different letters for the two blanks.

Possible words:
- B O N S _ → BONSE? (invalid)
- C O N S _ → CONSO? (invalid)
- F O N S _ → FONSE? (invalid)
- M O N S _ → MONSO? (invalid)
- P O N S _ → PONSO? (invalid)
- U O N S _ → UONST? (invalid)
- B O N _ S → BONBS? (invalid)
- C O N _ S → CONCS? (invalid)

Wait, let's think of real words fitting _ O N _ _ or _ O N _ S.

Real words:
- BONED (invalid, D ruled out)
- CONED (invalid, D ruled out)
- FONED (invalid)
- MONKS (S in 5, N in 3, O in 2, M and K new)
- PONGS (S in 5, N in 3, O in 2, P and G new)
- BONKS (S in 5, N in 3, O in 2, B and K new)

MONKS seems valid:
- M (new), O (position 2 ✓), N (position 3 ✓), K (new), S (position 5)

This fits all constraints.From the feedback:
- O is locked in position 2.
- N must be in position 3 (since positions 1,4,5 have been ruled out for N).
- S must be in the word but not in positions 1,3,4,5 (from previous (-) marks).  
  However, position 3 is N, so S must be in position 2 or 5.  
  Position 2 is O, so S must be in position 5.

Thus the structure is: _ O N _ S

Available letters for positions 1 and 4: B, C, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Real word fitting this: MONKS (M, O, N, K, S).

- CONGS – not standard  
- PONGS – P, O, N, G, S – all letters are allowed and G has not been ruled out. PONGS is a valid word (plural of pong, though informal, it’s recognized in some word lists).

Looking again, the only common word left seems to be PONGS, but let’s verify:

- CONFS – not a common word  
- FONDS – D is ruled out  
- GONFS – invalid  
- PONDS – D is ruled out  
- CONVS – invalid  
- BONVS – invalid  
- PONGS – G is allowed, but we already ruled K and G haven’t been tested yet. Wait, K was ruled out, G hasn’t been tested.  
- BONGS – G is allowed, but BONGS is not a standard word.  
- CONGS – not standard  
- PONGS – P, O, N, G, S – all letters are allowed and G has not been ruled out. PONGS is a valid word (plural of pong, though informal, it’s recognized in some word lists).

But let’s check simpler, more common words first:

- BONDS – D ruled out  
- BONAS – A ruled out  
- CONFS – not a word  
- FONDS – D ruled out  
- PONDS – D ruled out  
- CONVS – invalid  
- BONVS – invalid  

Looking again, the only common word left seems to be PONGS, but let’s verify:

P O N G S – all letters are allowed (P, O, N, G, S), and none of M, K, L, A, T, E, H, R, I, Y, D have been used here.

Therefore, PONGS is the logical next guess.",Guess 6: PONGS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) N(✓) G(x) S(✓),FAIL
