For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

A strong opening word would be ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good mix of high-frequency letters to maximize information gain from the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is correct in the 5th position.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain A, R, O, S.

Letters we still have to consider:
- Vowels left: I, U
- Common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

I want a new word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Uses none of A, R, O, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good candidates:
- ""TIGER"" – but R is out, so no.
- ""UNTIE"" – uses U, N, T, I, E. All letters are still possible. This seems good.
- ""CHIME"" – uses C, H, I, M, E. Also good.
- ""BLIMEY"" – but Y is less common and we don't know about it yet.

""UNTIE"" uses four new common letters (U, N, T, I) plus the confirmed E. It's a strong next guess.

So far we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T
- Letters that ARE in the word: I, E (with E fixed in the 5th position)
- I is somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 is already E), so positions 1, 2, or 3.

Remaining common letters to try: D, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that:
- Contains I (but not in 4th position, which is already E).
- Does NOT contain any of A, R, O, S, U, N, T.

Possible candidates:
- ""VIGE"" – but VIGE is not a common word.
- ""CHIME"" – but we haven't tested C, H, M yet. However, we know E is fixed at 5th, so CHIME would be C H I M E – this uses C, H, I, M, E. All letters are still possible, and it tests four new common letters.
- ""BLIME"" – but this is not a standard word.
- ""DIME"" – too short.
- ""WIGE"" – not a word.
- ""FIDGE"" – but F is less common.

""CHIME"" seems like the best next guess as it tests C, H, I, M, E – all still possible letters, with I in position 3 (which is allowed since I is in the word but not in position 4).

Wait, let me double-check: CHIME is C H I M E, so I is in position 3 – this is allowed because feedback said I is in the word but not in position 4 (which is E). So position 3 is fine.

""CHIME"" seems like the best next guess as it tests C, H, I, M, E – all still possible letters, with I in position 3 (which is allowed since I is in the word but not in position 4).

Wait, let me double-check: CHIME is C H I M E, so I is in position 3 – this is allowed because feedback said I is in the word but not in position 4 (which is E). So position 3 is fine.

Therefore, CHIME is a valid next guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

A strong opening word would be ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good mix of high-frequency letters to maximize information gain from the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is correct in the 5th position.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain A, R, O, S.

Letters we still have to consider:
- Vowels left: I, U
- Common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

I want a new word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Uses none of A, R, O, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good candidates:
- ""TIGER"" – but R is out, so no.
- ""UNTIE"" – uses U, N, T, I, E. All letters are still possible. This seems good.
- ""CHIME"" – uses C, H, I, M, E. Also good.
- ""BLIMEY"" – but Y is less common and we don't know about it yet.

""UNTIE"" uses four new common letters (U, N, T, I) plus the confirmed E. It's a strong next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - The word ends with E.
   - The letters A, R, O, S are NOT in the word.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓)
   - The word still ends with E.
   - The letters U, N, T are NOT in the word.
   - The letter I is in the word but NOT in the 4th position.

So far we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T
- Letters that ARE in the word: I, E (with E fixed in the 5th position)
- I is somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 is already E), so positions 1, 2, or 3.

Remaining common letters to try: D, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that:
- Contains I (but not in 4th position, which is already E).
- Does NOT contain any of A, R, O, S, U, N, T.

Possible candidates:
- ""VIGE"" – but VIGE is not a common word.
- ""CHIME"" – but we haven't tested C, H, M yet. However, we know E is fixed at 5th, so CHIME would be C H I M E – this uses C, H, I, M, E. All letters are still possible, and it tests four new common letters.
- ""BLIME"" – but this is not a standard word.
- ""DIME"" – too short.
- ""WIGE"" – not a word.
- ""FIDGE"" – but F is less common.

""CHIME"" seems like the best next guess as it tests C, H, I, M, E – all still possible letters, with I in position 3 (which is allowed since I is in the word but not in position 4).

Wait, let me double-check: CHIME is C H I M E, so I is in position 3 – this is allowed because feedback said I is in the word but not in position 4 (which is E). So position 3 is fine.

Therefore, CHIME is a valid next guess.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S  
   – Letter fixed: E in position 5

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: U, N, T  
   – Letter I is in the word but NOT in position 4

3. CHIME → C(x) H(x) I(✓) M(x) E(✓)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: C, H, M  
   – Letter I is now confirmed in position 3  
   – Letter E still fixed in position 5

So the pattern so far is:  
_ _ I _ E

Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, C, H, M  
Letters still possible and not yet placed: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the vowels I (already placed) and E (already placed).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 3 and E in position 5  
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no A, R, O, S, U, N, T, C, H, M)  
- Is a valid English word

Possible candidates:
- B I D D E → “BIDDE” (not common)  
- B I G G E → “BIGGE” (not a word)  
- D I L L E → “DILLE” (not standard)  
- F I L L E → “FILLE” (not standard)  
- G I V E N → “GIVEN” (but ends with N, already ruled out)

- V I G O R → “VIGOR” (O, R out)  
- W I D E N → “WIDEN” (N out)  
- P I G M Y → “PIGMY” (M out)  
- B I L L Y → “BILL Y” (Y allowed, but not a 5-letter word ending in E)  
- D I L L Y → same issue  
- L I V E D → “LIVED” (D allowed, ends in D, not E)  
- F I L E D → “ FILED” (D allowed, ends in D)  
- B I L E T → “BILED” (not a word)  
- G I V E N → already ruled out  
- V I G E T → “VIGET” (not a word)

- D I G E N → already ruled out

- F I G E N → already ruled out  
- P I G E N → already ruled out  

Looking back at the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, V, W, Y, etc.

- Y I V E N → not a word  
- Y I V E T → not a word  
- Y I V E D → not a word  

Hmm, none of these seem to be valid words. Let me step back.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ _ I _ E using only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, V, W, Y, plus I and E already placed.

Possible combinations:

- B I D D E → “BIDDE” (not a word)  
- B I D L E → “BIDLE” (not a word)  
- B I D V E → “BIDVE” (not a word)  
- B I D W E → “BIDWE” (not a word)  
- B I D Y E → “BIDYE” (not a word)  
- B I F F E → “BIFFE” (not a word)  
- B I F G E → “BIFGE” (not a word)  
- B I F L E → “BIFLE” (not a word)  
- B I F V E → “BIFVE” (not a word)  
- B I F W E → “BIFWE” (not a word)  
- B I F Y E → “BIFYE” (not a word)  
- B I G G E → “BIGGE” (not a word)  
- B I G L E → “BIGLE” (not a word)  
- B I G V E → “BIGVE” (not a word)  
- B I G W E → “BIGWE” (not a word)  
- B I G Y E → “BIGYE” (not a word)  
- B I L D E → “BILDE” (not a word)  
- B I L F E → “BILFE” (not a word)  
- B I L G E → “BILGE” (valid word)  
- B I L V E → “BILVE” (not a word)  
- B I L W E → “BILWE” (not a word)  
- B I L Y E → “BILYE” (not a word)  
- B I V D E → “BIVDE” (not a word)  
- B I V F E → “BIVFE” (not a word)  
- B I V G E → “BIVGE” (not a word)  
- B I V L E → “BIVLE” (not a word)  
- B I V W E → “BIVWE” (not a word)  
- B I V Y E → “BIVYE” (not a word)  
- B I W D E → “BIWDE” (not a word)  
- B I W F E → “BIWFE” (not a word)  
- B I W G E → “BIWGE” (not a word)  
- B I W L E → “BIWLE” (not a word)  
- B I W V E → “BIWVE” (not a word)  
- B I W Y E → “BIWYE” (not a word)  
- B I Y D E → “BIYDE” (not a word)  
- B I Y F E → “BIYFE” (not a word)  
- B I Y G E → “BIYGE” (not a word)  
- B I Y L E → “BIYLE” (not a word)  
- B I Y V E → “BIYVE” (not a word)  
- B I Y W E → “BIYWE” (not a word)  

“BILGE” is the only valid word I can see that fits: B I L G E, but this has G in position 4, which is allowed, and it uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Let me check if BILGE is a valid word: yes, it means the residue of a ship’s holding tank.

So BILGE is a good next guess.

Let's update what we now know after four guesses.

   – Letter I is in the word but NOT in position 2 (it is already confirmed in position 3, so this is consistent).  
   – Letter L is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Current confirmed pattern: _ _ I _ E  
Letters known to be absent: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, C, H, M, B, G  
Letters still possible: D, F, J, K, L, P, V, W, Y, I, E

From guess 4 we also learned:
- L is in the word but not in position 3.  
  Since position 3 is already I, this means L must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

So the word must contain L somewhere, and the only open positions are 1, 2, 4.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, with I in position 3, containing L but not in position 3 (which it isn't anyway), and using only the allowed letters.

Possible forms:  
L _ I _ E  
_ L I _ E  
_ _ I L E  

Let’s list valid English words that fit these patterns with allowed letters:

- L _ I _ E  
  – L I V E ? (needs 5 letters)  
  – L I V E D → ""LIVED"" (D allowed)  
  – L I V E N → ""LIVEN"" (N out)  
  – L I G E T → G out  
  – L I D L E → not a word  
  – L I F F E → not a word  
  – L I D D E → not a word  
  – L I V E D → ""LIVED"" (valid)  
  – L I V E T → not a word  
  – L I P E D → not a word  
  – L I P E T → not a word  
  – L I V E D is the only valid candidate here.

- _ L I _ E  
  – F L I P E → not a word

  – P L I V E → not a word  
  – V L I D E → not a word

  – D L I G E → G out  
  – P L I D E → not a word  
  – V L I G E → G out  
  – No valid words here.

  – Y I L L E → not a word  
  – K I L L E → not a word  
  – F I L I E → not a word  
  – No valid words here.

Thus, the only valid word that fits all constraints is ""LIVED"".

Let’s verify:
- LIVED  
  – Letters: L, I, V, E, D  
  – All letters are from the allowed set.  
  – I is in position 3 (confirmed).  
  – E is in position 5 (confirmed).  
  – L is in position 1 (allowed, since L must be somewhere and not in position 3).  
  – V and D have not been tested yet.  
  – No forbidden letters are used.

Therefore, ""LIVED"" is the logical next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

A strong opening word would be ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives me a good mix of high-frequency letters to maximize information gain from the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is correct in the 5th position.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain A, R, O, S.

Letters we still have to consider:
- Vowels left: I, U
- Common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

I want a new word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Uses none of A, R, O, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good candidates:
- ""TIGER"" – but R is out, so no.
- ""UNTIE"" – uses U, N, T, I, E. All letters are still possible. This seems good.
- ""CHIME"" – uses C, H, I, M, E. Also good.
- ""BLIMEY"" – but Y is less common and we don't know about it yet.

""UNTIE"" uses four new common letters (U, N, T, I) plus the confirmed E. It's a strong next guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - The word ends with E.
   - The letters A, R, O, S are NOT in the word.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓)
   - The word still ends with E.
   - The letters U, N, T are NOT in the word.
   - The letter I is in the word but NOT in the 4th position.

So far we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T
- Letters that ARE in the word: I, E (with E fixed in the 5th position)
- I is somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 is already E), so positions 1, 2, or 3.

Remaining common letters to try: D, L, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that:
- Contains I (but not in 4th position, which is already E).
- Does NOT contain any of A, R, O, S, U, N, T.

Possible candidates:
- ""VIGE"" – but VIGE is not a common word.
- ""CHIME"" – but we haven't tested C, H, M yet. However, we know E is fixed at 5th, so CHIME would be C H I M E – this uses C, H, I, M, E. All letters are still possible, and it tests four new common letters.
- ""BLIME"" – but this is not a standard word.
- ""DIME"" – too short.
- ""WIGE"" – not a word.
- ""FIDGE"" – but F is less common.

""CHIME"" seems like the best next guess as it tests C, H, I, M, E – all still possible letters, with I in position 3 (which is allowed since I is in the word but not in position 4).

Wait, let me double-check: CHIME is C H I M E, so I is in position 3 – this is allowed because feedback said I is in the word but not in position 4 (which is E). So position 3 is fine.

Therefore, CHIME is a valid next guess.

3. CHIME → C(x) H(x) I(✓) M(x) E(✓)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: C, H, M  
   – Letter I is now confirmed in position 3  
   – Letter E still fixed in position 5

So the pattern so far is:  
_ _ I _ E

Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, C, H, M  
Letters still possible and not yet placed: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the vowels I (already placed) and E (already placed).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 3 and E in position 5

- Is a valid English word

Hmm, none of these seem to be valid words. Let me step back.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ _ I _ E using only the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, V, W, Y, plus I and E already placed.

Possible combinations:

- B I D D E → “BIDDE” (not a word)  
- B I D L E → “BIDLE” (not a word)  
- B I D V E → “BIDVE” (not a word)  
- B I D W E → “BIDWE” (not a word)  
- B I D Y E → “BIDYE” (not a word)

- B I L G E → “BILGE” (valid word)  
- B I L V E → “BILVE” (not a word)  
- B I L W E → “BILWE” (not a word)

- B I V F E → “BIVFE” (not a word)  
- B I V G E → “BIVGE” (not a word)

- B I V W E → “BIVWE” (not a word)  
- B I V Y E → “BIVYE” (not a word)  
- B I W D E → “BIWDE” (not a word)

- B I Y W E → “BIYWE” (not a word)  

“BILGE” is the only valid word I can see that fits: B I L G E, but this has G in position 4, which is allowed, and it uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Let me check if BILGE is a valid word: yes, it means the residue of a ship’s holding tank.

So BILGE is a good next guess.

Let's update what we now know after four guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S  
   – Letter E is fixed in position 5.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: U, N, T  
   – Letter I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

3. CHIME → C(x) H(x) I(✓) M(x) E(✓)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: C, H, M  
   – Letter I is now confirmed in position 3.

4. BILGE → B(x) I(-) L(-) G(x) E(✓)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: B, G  
   – Letter I is in the word but NOT in position 2 (it is already confirmed in position 3, so this is consistent).  
   – Letter L is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Current confirmed pattern: _ _ I _ E  
Letters known to be absent: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, C, H, M, B, G  
Letters still possible: D, F, J, K, L, P, V, W, Y, I, E

From guess 4 we also learned:
- L is in the word but not in position 3.  
  Since position 3 is already I, this means L must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

So the word must contain L somewhere, and the only open positions are 1, 2, 4.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, with I in position 3, containing L but not in position 3 (which it isn't anyway), and using only the allowed letters.

Possible forms:  
L _ I _ E  
_ L I _ E  
_ _ I L E  

Let’s list valid English words that fit these patterns with allowed letters:

- L _ I _ E  
  – L I V E ? (needs 5 letters)  
  – L I V E D → ""LIVED"" (D allowed)  
  – L I V E N → ""LIVEN"" (N out)  
  – L I G E T → G out  
  – L I D L E → not a word  
  – L I F F E → not a word  
  – L I D D E → not a word  
  – L I V E D → ""LIVED"" (valid)  
  – L I V E T → not a word  
  – L I P E D → not a word  
  – L I P E T → not a word  
  – L I V E D is the only valid candidate here.

- _ L I _ E  
  – F L I P E → not a word  
  – D L I V E → not a word  
  – P L I V E → not a word  
  – V L I D E → not a word  
  – K L I V E → not a word  
  – F L I D E → not a word  
  – D L I G E → G out  
  – P L I D E → not a word  
  – V L I G E → G out  
  – No valid words here.

- _ _ I L E  
  – D I L L E → not a word  
  – F I L L E → not a word  
  – P I L L E → not a word  
  – V I L L E → not a word  
  – W I L L E → not a word  
  – Y I L L E → not a word  
  – K I L L E → not a word  
  – F I L I E → not a word  
  – No valid words here.

Thus, the only valid word that fits all constraints is ""LIVED"".

Let’s verify:
- LIVED  
  – Letters: L, I, V, E, D  
  – All letters are from the allowed set.  
  – I is in position 3 (confirmed).  
  – E is in position 5 (confirmed).  
  – L is in position 1 (allowed, since L must be somewhere and not in position 3).  
  – V and D have not been tested yet.  
  – No forbidden letters are used.

Therefore, ""LIVED"" is the logical next guess.

Let me update the knowledge base after the fifth guess.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   – E is fixed in position 5.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓)  
   – I is in the word but not in position 4.

3. CHIME → C(x) H(x) I(✓) M(x) E(✓)  
   – I is confirmed in position 3.

4. BILGE → B(x) I(-) L(-) G(x) E(✓)  
   – L is in the word but not in position 3 (already known to be I).

5. LIVED → L(-) I(-) V(x) E(-) D(x)  
   – L is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – I is in the word but not in position 2 (already known to be position 3).  
   – V and D are NOT in the word.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ I _ E  
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, C, H, M, B, G, V, D  
- Letters still possible: F, J, K, L, P, W, Y, I, E  
- L must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 3.  
  Since position 3 is I, L must be in position 2 or 4.

Possible forms:
- _ L I _ E  
- _ _ I L E  

Let’s list valid 5-letter English words that fit these patterns with allowed letters:

- _ L I _ E  
  – F L I P E → not a word  
  – P L I C E → C out  
  – K L I C E → C out  
  – F L I G E → G out  
  – P L I G E → G out  
  – W L I C E → C out  
  – No valid words here.

- _ _ I L E  
  – F I L L E → not a word  
  – P I L L E → not a word  
  – W I L L E → not a word  
  – Y I L L E → not a word  
  – K I L L E → not a word  
  – F I L I E → not a word  
  – P I L I E → not a word  
  – W I L D E → D out  
  – F I L V E → V out  
  – No valid words here.

Wait, let me check if I missed any. The remaining letters are F, J, K, L, P, W, Y.

Another approach: Since L must be in position 2 or 4, and we have only one I in position 3, let’s try:

- _ L I _ E  
  – F L I P E → not a word  
  – K L I P E → not a word  
  – P L I K E → not a word  
  – W L I P E → not a word  
  – Y L I P E → not a word  

- _ _ I L E  
  – F I L K E → not a word  
  – P I L K E → not a word  
  – W I L K E → not a word  
  – Y I L K E → not a word  

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me think differently.
