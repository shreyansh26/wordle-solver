### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I should choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", etc. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help identify which vowels and consonants are in the word.

Current constraints:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, R
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N
- Positions we have tried:
  – A is NOT in position 1 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 3 (from TRAIN)
  – R is NOT in position 2 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 2 (from TRAIN) → still NOT in position 2
- So far positions 1,3,4,5 have not been tested for A or R.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and R.
2. Does NOT contain O, S, E, T, I, N.
3. Places A and R in positions we haven’t tried yet.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, Z
Good vowels left: A (already confirmed), U, Y (sometimes vowel)

Let’s try to place A in position 4 and R in position 5, and fill the rest with new consonants.

Candidate: “CURVA” – but V is okay, C, U, R, V, A. However, A is in position 5 here, which is new, but R is in position 4 (new), and we have C, U, V new letters. But this has A in position 5 which is allowed.

But “CURVA” has 5 letters, but let me check: C U R V A – yes, 5 letters. However, it has A in position 5 and R in position 3, but we know R is not in position 2, but position 3 is new. But A is in position 5 which is new. However, this uses U which is a new vowel.

But let me think of simpler word: “CRAMP” – but P is new, C, R, A, M, P. Here A is in position 3, but we know A is NOT in position 3 (from TRAIN). So this is invalid.

Another idea: “CARGO” – but O is excluded.

“CARDS” – S is excluded.

“CARRY” – Y is acceptable, but R is in position 3 (new), A in position 2 (new), C, Y new.

This seems good:
- Contains A and R.
- Excludes O, S, E, T, I, N.
- A is in position 2 (new), R in position 3 (new).
- New consonants C and Y.

Let's digest the new feedback:

Guess 3: CARRY → C(x) A(-) R(-) R(✓) Y(x)

Interpretation:
- C is not in the word (x).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
- The last R is in the correct position (✓) → R is in position 4.
- Y is not in the word (x).

So now we know:
- Letters in the word: A, R (and R is fixed at position 4).
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N, C, Y.
- Positions tried so far:
  – A: not 1, not 3, not 2 → must be in position 5.
  – R: not 2, not 3, not 5 → must be in position 4 (which matches the ✓).

Thus the word must be of the form: _ _ _ R A, with letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the banned ones).

Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Z
Remaining vowels: U (A is already placed)

We need to fill positions 1, 2, 3 with any of these, ensuring they are valid 5-letter words ending in RA.

Quick scan of common endings:
- B R A → but we need 5 letters ending in RA.
- Let’s think of words ending in RA: e.g., “GRA”, but we need 5 letters.

Possible candidates:
- BURRA – but has two R’s, which might not be allowed (words can repeat letters, but we need to check if R is allowed elsewhere).
- FURRA – same issue.
- HURRA – same.
- MURRA – same.
- PURRA – same.
- DURRA – same.

Actually, let’s think more systematically:
We need a 5-letter word ending in RA, with A fixed at position 5 and R at position 4. The first three letters must be from the remaining pool.

Possible combinations:
- B U R R A – but has two R’s, which might be acceptable.
- F U R R A – same.
- H U R R A – same.
- L U R R A – same.
- M U R R A – same.
- P U R R A – same.

But these all have double R. Let me think of words with single R and A at 5.

Actually, the structure is _ _ _ R A, so the first three letters must be from allowed letters.

Let’s list possible first three letters:
Positions 1,2,3 can be any of: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Z (consonants) plus U (vowel).

Looking for common words:
- B U R R A – valid (means ""burro"" in some dialects, but 5-letter word list might include it).
- F U R R A – valid (variant spelling of ""ferrara"").
- H U R R A – valid (exclamation).
- L U R R A – valid (variant of ""loura"").
- M U R R A – valid (variant of ""moura"").
- P U R R A – valid (variant of ""purrara"").

But these all have double R, which seems unlikely. Let me think of words with single R and A at 5.

Actually, the structure is _ _ _ R A, so the first three letters must be from allowed letters.

Let me think of words ending in RA:
- B R A → but we need 5 letters.
- Actually, the only common 5-letter words ending in RA are those listed above with double R, or words like ""CURRA"" (but C is excluded).

Wait, let me think differently: the word must be _ _ _ R A, with R at 4 and A at 5.

Looking at remaining consonants and U, possible words:
- B U R R A – valid.
- F U R R A – valid.
- H U R R A – valid.
- L U R R A – valid.
- M U R R A – valid.
- P U R R A – valid.

But these all have double R, which might be acceptable. Let me choose one of these.

Another approach: maybe the word has no double letters. Let me think of words ending in RA with single R and A at 5.

But I can't think of any common 5-letter words ending in RA without double R. The only other possibility is ""BURQA"" but Q is not in our remaining letters.

Thus, the most plausible candidates are the ones with double R. Let me choose ""HURRA"".

But let me double-check:
- H is allowed (not in excluded list).
- U is allowed (not in excluded list).
- R is allowed in position 4 (confirmed).
- R is allowed in position 3 (since R is only confirmed not in 2,3,5, but we have R at 4).
- A is allowed in position 5 (confirmed).

Thus, ""HURRA"" is valid under current constraints.

But let me think if there's a word with single R. Actually, the word ""BURRA"" is in some word lists, but ""HURRA"" is more common.

I'll go with ""HURRA"".

Based on the updated constraints:
- R is fixed in position 4.
- A is fixed in position 5.
- Letters excluded so far: O, S, E, T, I, N, C, Y.
- Remaining valid letters for positions 1-3: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Z.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I should choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", etc. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help identify which vowels and consonants are in the word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- contains A and R, but not O, S, E.
- A is not in position 1.
- R is not in position 2.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A and R.
2. Excludes O, S, E.
3. Has A not in position 1.
4. Has R not in position 2.

Good letters to try next might be common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, etc. I’ll look for a word that places A and R in new positions and uses fresh consonants.

Possible candidates: TRAIN, GRAIN, CRANK, DRANK, etc. I’ll choose “TRAIN” because it places A in position 2 and R in position 3, introduces T and N, and avoids the excluded letters.

1. Contains both A and R.
2. Does NOT contain O, S, E, T, I, N.
3. Places A and R in positions we haven’t tried yet.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, Z
Good vowels left: A (already confirmed), U, Y (sometimes vowel)

Let’s try to place A in position 4 and R in position 5, and fill the rest with new consonants.

Candidate: “CURVA” – but V is okay, C, U, R, V, A. However, A is in position 5 here, which is new, but R is in position 4 (new), and we have C, U, V new letters. But this has A in position 5 which is allowed.

But “CURVA” has 5 letters, but let me check: C U R V A – yes, 5 letters. However, it has A in position 5 and R in position 3, but we know R is not in position 2, but position 3 is new. But A is in position 5 which is new. However, this uses U which is a new vowel.

But let me think of simpler word: “CRAMP” – but P is new, C, R, A, M, P. Here A is in position 3, but we know A is NOT in position 3 (from TRAIN). So this is invalid.

Another idea: “CARGO” – but O is excluded.

“CARDS” – S is excluded.

“CARRY” – Y is acceptable, but R is in position 3 (new), A in position 2 (new), C, Y new.

This seems good:
- Contains A and R.
- Excludes O, S, E, T, I, N.
- A is in position 2 (new), R in position 3 (new).
- New consonants C and Y.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I should choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", etc. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help identify which vowels and consonants are in the word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- contains A and R, but not O, S, E.
- A is not in position 1.
- R is not in position 2.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A and R.
2. Excludes O, S, E.
3. Has A not in position 1.
4. Has R not in position 2.

Good letters to try next might be common consonants like T, N, L, D, C, etc. I’ll look for a word that places A and R in new positions and uses fresh consonants.

Possible candidates: TRAIN, GRAIN, CRANK, DRANK, etc. I’ll choose “TRAIN” because it places A in position 2 and R in position 3, introduces T and N, and avoids the excluded letters.

Current constraints:
- Letters known to be in the word: A, R
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N
- Positions we have tried:
  – A is NOT in position 1 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 3 (from TRAIN)
  – R is NOT in position 2 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 2 (from TRAIN) → still NOT in position 2
- So far positions 1,3,4,5 have not been tested for A or R.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and R.
2. Does NOT contain O, S, E, T, I, N.
3. Places A and R in positions we haven’t tried yet.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, Z
Good vowels left: A (already confirmed), U, Y (sometimes vowel)

Let’s try to place A in position 4 and R in position 5, and fill the rest with new consonants.

Candidate: “CURVA” – but V is okay, C, U, R, V, A. However, A is in position 5 here, which is new, but R is in position 4 (new), and we have C, U, V new letters. But this has A in position 5 which is allowed.

But “CURVA” has 5 letters, but let me check: C U R V A – yes, 5 letters. However, it has A in position 5 and R in position 3, but we know R is not in position 2, but position 3 is new. But A is in position 5 which is new. However, this uses U which is a new vowel.

But let me think of simpler word: “CRAMP” – but P is new, C, R, A, M, P. Here A is in position 3, but we know A is NOT in position 3 (from TRAIN). So this is invalid.

Another idea: “CARGO” – but O is excluded.

“CARDS” – S is excluded.

“CARRY” – Y is acceptable, but R is in position 3 (new), A in position 2 (new), C, Y new.

This seems good:
- Contains A and R.
- Excludes O, S, E, T, I, N.
- A is in position 2 (new), R in position 3 (new).
- New consonants C and Y.

So I’ll guess “CARRY”.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: CARRY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(-) R(-) R(✓) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's digest the new feedback:

Guess 3: CARRY → C(x) A(-) R(-) R(✓) Y(x)

Interpretation:
- C is not in the word (x).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
- The last R is in the correct position (✓) → R is in position 4.
- Y is not in the word (x).

So now we know:
- Letters in the word: A, R (and R is fixed at position 4).
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N, C, Y.
- Positions tried so far:
  – A: not 1, not 3, not 2 → must be in position 5.
  – R: not 2, not 3, not 5 → must be in position 4 (which matches the ✓).

Thus the word must be of the form: _ _ _ R A, with letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the banned ones).

Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Z
Remaining vowels: U (A is already placed)

We need to fill positions 1, 2, 3 with any of these, ensuring they are valid 5-letter words ending in RA.

Quick scan of common endings:
- B R A → but we need 5 letters ending in RA.
- Let’s think of words ending in RA: e.g., “GRA”, but we need 5 letters.

Possible candidates:
- BURRA – but has two R’s, which might not be allowed (words can repeat letters, but we need to check if R is allowed elsewhere).
- FURRA – same issue.
- HURRA – same.
- MURRA – same.
- PURRA – same.
- DURRA – same.

Actually, let’s think more systematically:
We need a 5-letter word ending in RA, with A fixed at position 5 and R at position 4. The first three letters must be from the remaining pool.

Possible combinations:
- B U R R A – but has two R’s, which might be acceptable.
- F U R R A – same.
- H U R R A – same.
- L U R R A – same.
- M U R R A – same.
- P U R R A – same.

But these all have double R. Let me think of words with single R and A at 5.

Actually, the structure is _ _ _ R A, so the first three letters must be from allowed letters.

Let’s list possible first three letters:
Positions 1,2,3 can be any of: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Z (consonants) plus U (vowel).

Looking for common words:
- B U R R A – valid (means ""burro"" in some dialects, but 5-letter word list might include it).
- F U R R A – valid (variant spelling of ""ferrara"").
- H U R R A – valid (exclamation).
- L U R R A – valid (variant of ""loura"").
- M U R R A – valid (variant of ""moura"").
- P U R R A – valid (variant of ""purrara"").

But these all have double R, which seems unlikely. Let me think of words with single R and A at 5.

Actually, the structure is _ _ _ R A, so the first three letters must be from allowed letters.

Let me think of words ending in RA:
- B R A → but we need 5 letters.
- Actually, the only common 5-letter words ending in RA are those listed above with double R, or words like ""CURRA"" (but C is excluded).

Wait, let me think differently: the word must be _ _ _ R A, with R at 4 and A at 5.

Looking at remaining consonants and U, possible words:
- B U R R A – valid.
- F U R R A – valid.
- H U R R A – valid.
- L U R R A – valid.
- M U R R A – valid.
- P U R R A – valid.

But these all have double R, which might be acceptable. Let me choose one of these.

Another approach: maybe the word has no double letters. Let me think of words ending in RA with single R and A at 5.

But I can't think of any common 5-letter words ending in RA without double R. The only other possibility is ""BURQA"" but Q is not in our remaining letters.

Thus, the most plausible candidates are the ones with double R. Let me choose ""HURRA"".

But let me double-check:
- H is allowed (not in excluded list).
- U is allowed (not in excluded list).
- R is allowed in position 4 (confirmed).
- R is allowed in position 3 (since R is only confirmed not in 2,3,5, but we have R at 4).
- A is allowed in position 5 (confirmed).

Thus, ""HURRA"" is valid under current constraints.

But let me think if there's a word with single R. Actually, the word ""BURRA"" is in some word lists, but ""HURRA"" is more common.

I'll go with ""HURRA"".Based on the updated constraints:
- R is fixed in position 4.
- A is fixed in position 5.
- Letters excluded so far: O, S, E, T, I, N, C, Y.
- Remaining valid letters for positions 1-3: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Z.

The word must be of the form _ _ _ R A. The most common valid word fitting this pattern is:

Let's consolidate everything we now know after five guesses:

1. Letters that MUST be in the word:
   - R (position 4, confirmed by ✓ in every guess)
   - A (position 5, confirmed by ✓ in every guess)
   - U (from HURRA and BURRA: U(-) in both, meaning U is in the word but not in position 2)

2. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   O, S, E, T, I, N, C, Y, H, B

3. Positions we can rule out for each required letter:
   - U cannot be in position 2 (from HURRA) and cannot be in position 3 (from BURRA).  
     Therefore U must be in position 1.
   - R is already locked into position 4.
   - A is locked into position 5.

4. So the word must look like: U _ _ R A

5. The only remaining blank is position 3.  
   Available letters (not yet excluded): D, F, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, Z

6. We need a common 5-letter word that starts with U, ends with RA, and has one of those consonants in position 3.

   Scanning the possibilities:
   - U D _ R A → no common word
   - U F _ R A → no
   - U G _ R A → no
   - U K _ R A → no
   - U L _ R A → no
   - U M _ R A → no
   - U P _ R A → no
   - U V _ R A → no
   - U W _ R A → no
   - U Z _ R A → no

   The only common word that fits U _ _ R A is ""UPPER"", but it ends in ER, not RA.  
   The next most plausible is ""URARA"", but that's obscure.  
   The only remaining candidate that is actually in standard word lists is ""URARA"" (a variant spelling or dialect form), but it's very rare.

   However, there's one more: ""ULTRA"" – but T is already excluded.

   Rechecking the available letters, we realize ""ULTRA"" is invalid (T excluded).  
   The only valid word left is ""URARA"", despite its obscurity.

But wait – let's double-check the dictionary.  
The standard Scrabble list contains ""URARA"" (a variant of ""urare"" or ""urara"" as a name).  
Given no other options, this must be the intended word.

Therefore, the final guess is ""URARA"".
