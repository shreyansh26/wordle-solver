### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and we have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information gain

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- All 5 common vowels (A, O, E)
- Common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters

This will give us maximum information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - R is fixed in position 2.
   - A and E are in the word but not in positions 1 and 5.

2. TREAD → T(x) R(✓) E(✓) A(✓) D(✓)
   - Pattern revealed: _ R E A D

3. BREAD → B(x) R(✓) E(✓) A(✓) D(✓)
   - Confirms the pattern _ R E A D.
   - B is not in the word, so the first letter must be a different consonant.

Possible first letters (common consonants not yet ruled out): C, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, etc.

Let's try ""C"" first - ""CREAD"" is not a valid English word, but ""CREED"" is not matching the pattern. Wait, we need a valid 5-letter word that starts with a consonant and has the pattern _ R E A D.

Valid words fitting _ R E A D:
- CREAD is invalid.
- FREAD is invalid.
- GREAD is invalid.
- HREAD is invalid.
- MREAD is invalid.
- PREAD is invalid.
- NREAD is invalid.
- SREAD is invalid (S already excluded).
- TREAD already tried.
- BREAD already tried.

Wait, actually the only valid English word that fits _ R E A D is ""TREAD"" and ""BREAD"" which we have already tried. This suggests we need to check if there are other possible words.

But looking at the pattern _ R E A D, the only valid words are:
- TREAD (tried)
- BREAD (tried)
- CREAD (invalid)
- FREAD (invalid)
- GREAD (invalid)
- HREAD (invalid)
- MREAD (invalid)
- NREAD (invalid)
- SREAD (invalid)
- DREAD (invalid - would be DREAD, but D is already in position 5)

Actually, ""DREAD"" is a valid word, but it would be D R E A D, which would have D in both positions 1 and 5, but our feedback shows D is correct in position 5, so DREAD is possible.

But we have D(✓) in position 5 from TREAD feedback, so DREAD would have D in position 1 and 5, but the word could have D in position 1 and 5, but that's unusual.

However, looking back, the pattern is _ R E A D, so the word must be [consonant] R E A D.

Valid words:
- TREAD (T already tried)
- BREAD (B already tried)
- DREAD (D as first letter)

""DREAD"" is a valid word meaning to intimidate or threaten, and it fits the pattern D R E A D.

Since B and T have been tried and failed, the next logical guess is DREAD.

But wait, we have D(✓) in position 5, so DREAD would have D in position 1 and 5, which is possible.

However, let's check if there are any other possibilities. The pattern is _ R E A D, and the first letter must be a consonant not yet used (B, T, S, O, etc.).

Looking at the dictionary, the only valid word fitting this pattern is DREAD.

Therefore, the next guess should be DREAD.
</think>

The feedback from all guesses shows the pattern _ R E A D is locked, with R, E, A, D in positions 2-5. The first letter must be a consonant not yet ruled out (B, T, S, etc.). The only valid English word matching this exact pattern is ""DREAD"".
