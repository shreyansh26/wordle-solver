### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll try to use as many of these as possible in one word.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination should give us good information about which of these common letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 3rd, so it must be 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 4th, so it must be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th).

So we know:
- Letters definitely out: A, R, E
- Letters definitely in: O, S

We need a 5-letter word that:

- O is not in 3rd position
- S is not in 4th position

Good candidates would use other common letters not yet eliminated. Common remaining letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, P, M, etc.

Let’s try a word that places O and S in new positions and uses other common letters. ""SOUND"" comes to mind:
- S is now 1st (allowed, since S was 4th before)
- O is now 2nd (allowed, since O was 3rd before)
- Uses common letters U, N, D
- No A, R, or E

This should give us new positional information for O and S, plus info on U, N, D.

Wait, “BOOST” has two O’s, but we only know one O is in position 2. It might still be valid, but let’s see if we can find a word with distinct letters.

“FOIST”:
