For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C.

Looking at these letters, I can form several good first guesses. One popular choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and common consonants. Another good option is ""RAISE"" for similar reasons.

Between these, I'll go with ""RAISE"" because:
1. It uses 5 distinct letters.
2. It contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) which helps identify vowels quickly.
3. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S).

This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C.

Looking at these letters, I can form several good first guesses. One popular choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and common consonants. Another good option is ""RAISE"" for similar reasons.

Between these, I'll go with ""RAISE"" because:
1. It uses 5 distinct letters.
2. It contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) which helps identify vowels quickly.
3. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S).

This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- I is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the 4th letter is S
- E is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ S _
- Letters to avoid: R, I, E
- Letters confirmed present: A (somewhere not position 2), S (position 4)

Next step: pick a word that keeps S in position 4, uses A in a different position, and introduces new common consonants to test. Good candidates: 
- PLAYS (but E is out, so no)
- STAND (but R is out, so no)
- PASSE (but E is out, and S is already used)
- CHASM (but M is less common)

A strong choice is ""CHASM"":
- Keeps S in position 4
- Moves A to position 3 (new position)
- Tests C, H, M (common letters)
- Avoids R, I, E

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - S is locked in position 4.

   - Letters to avoid so far: R, I, E.

2. CHASM → C(x) H(x) A(✓) S(✓) M(-)
   - Confirms S in position 4 and A in position 3.
   - C and H are not in the word.
   - M is in the word but not in position 5.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ A S _
- Letters known to be in the word: A (position 3), S (position 4), M (somewhere except position 5).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, I, E, C, H.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 3 and S in position 4.
- Contains M somewhere except position 5.
- Uses none of the excluded letters (R, I, E, C, H).

Possible words:
- GAMAS (but G is okay, and M is in position 2) – but double A might be unlikely.
- DAMPS (but D is okay, M in position 2, P okay) – but P is new.
- LAMBS (L, A, M, B, S) – fits perfectly: A in 3, S in 4, M in 2, and avoids all excluded letters.

""LAMBS"" satisfies all constraints:
- A in position 3, S in position 4.
- M in position 2 (not 5).
- Uses L, A, M, B, S – none of R, I, E, C, H.

   - L and B are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2 or 3, so A must be in position 1 or 5.
   - M is in the word but not in position 2 or 5, so M must be in position 1 or 3. Position 3 is now known to be A, so M must be in position 1.

4. MATAS → M(-) A(-) T(x) A(-) S(✓)
   - T is not in the word.
   - M is in the word but not in position 1 (so M must be in position 3 or 5, but position 3 is A, so M must be in position 5).
   - A is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from MATAS feedback), so A must be in position 1 or 5. But position 5 is now known to be M, so A must be in position 1.

So the pattern is now:

- Position 3: A
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: M
- Position 2 is unknown, but must be a letter not yet excluded.

Excluded letters so far: R, I, E, C, H, L, B, T.

Available letters for position 2: D, F, G, K, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit A _ A S M:
- A D A S M (not valid)
- A F A S M (not valid)
- A G A S M (not valid)
- A N A S M (not valid)
- A P A S M (not valid)
- A V A S M (not valid)
- A W A S M (not valid)

The only valid word that fits is ""AGASM"" (a slang term for ""I'm getting sick of this""), but it uses G and S twice, which might not be the case.

Wait, let's think differently - maybe position 2 is a single letter, and the word is A _ A S M. The valid word here is ""AGASM"" but it's obscure.

However, looking at common words, ""AGASM"" seems unlikely. Let me double-check if I missed any.

Another approach: since position 2 is the only unknown, and the word must be A _ A S M, the only valid word is ""AGASM"".

But let's verify:
- A G A S M: letters used are A, G, A, S, M - none are excluded, and it's a valid word (though slang).

Given the constraints, ""AGASM"" is the only possible word left.

However, let's consider if there's an error in our deduction. From MATAS feedback:
- M(-) means M is in the word but not in position 1.
- From earlier, M must be in position 5 (since it can't be 1, 2, or 3, and 5 is the only remaining spot).

Similarly, A must be in position 1 (since it can't be 2, 3, or 4, and 5 is M).

Thus the pattern is A _ A S M, and the only valid word is ""AGASM"".

But ""AGASM"" is quite obscure. Let me check again for any other possibilities.

Looking at the pattern A _ A S M, the only valid English word is ""AGASM"".

Therefore, the next guess must be ""AGASM"".

1. RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)

   - A is in the word but not in position 2 or 3, so A must be in position 1 or 5.
   - M is in the word but not in position 2 or 5, so M must be in position 1 or 3. Position 3 is now known to be A, so M must be in position 1.

4. MATAS → M(-) A(-) T(x) A(-) S(✓)
   - T is not in the word.
   - M is in the word but not in position 1 (so M must be in position 3 or 5, but position 3 is A, so M must be in position 5).
   - A is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from MATAS feedback), so A must be in position 1 or 5. But position 5 is now known to be M, so A must be in position 1.

So the pattern is now:
- Position 1: A

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C.

Looking at these letters, I can form several good first guesses. One popular choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and common consonants. Another good option is ""RAISE"" for similar reasons.

Between these, I'll go with ""RAISE"" because:
1. It uses 5 distinct letters.
2. It contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) which helps identify vowels quickly.
3. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S).

This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- I is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so the 4th letter is S
- E is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ S _
- Letters to avoid: R, I, E
- Letters confirmed present: A (somewhere not position 2), S (position 4)

Next step: pick a word that keeps S in position 4, uses A in a different position, and introduces new common consonants to test. Good candidates: 
- PLAYS (but E is out, so no)
- STAND (but R is out, so no)
- PASSE (but E is out, and S is already used)
- CHASM (but M is less common)

A strong choice is ""CHASM"":
- Keeps S in position 4
- Moves A to position 3 (new position)
- Tests C, H, M (common letters)
- Avoids R, I, E

Guess 2: CHASM -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) A(✓) S(✓) M(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - S is locked in position 4.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - Letters to avoid so far: R, I, E.

2. CHASM → C(x) H(x) A(✓) S(✓) M(-)
   - Confirms S in position 4 and A in position 3.
   - C and H are not in the word.
   - M is in the word but not in position 5.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ A S _
- Letters known to be in the word: A (position 3), S (position 4), M (somewhere except position 5).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, I, E, C, H.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 3 and S in position 4.
- Contains M somewhere except position 5.
- Uses none of the excluded letters (R, I, E, C, H).

Possible words:
- GAMAS (but G is okay, and M is in position 2) – but double A might be unlikely.
- DAMPS (but D is okay, M in position 2, P okay) – but P is new.
- LAMBS (L, A, M, B, S) – fits perfectly: A in 3, S in 4, M in 2, and avoids all excluded letters.

""LAMBS"" satisfies all constraints:
- A in position 3, S in position 4.
- M in position 2 (not 5).
- Uses L, A, M, B, S – none of R, I, E, C, H.

Let's update what we now know after the three guesses.

1. RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - S is fixed in position 4.
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from RAISE) and NOT in position 3 (from CHASM and LAMBS), so A must be in position 1 or 5.

2. CHASM → C(x) H(x) A(✓) S(✓) M(-)
   - Confirms S in position 4 and A in position 3.  
   - M is in the word but not in position 5.

3. LAMBS → L(x) A(-) M(-) B(x) S(✓)
   - L and B are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2 (already known) or 3 (now confirmed), so A must be in position 1 or 5.
   - M is in the word but not in position 2 or 5, so M must be in position 1 or 3. However, position 3 is now known to be A (from CHASM), so M must be in position 1.

So far:
- Position 1: M (only remaining spot for M)
- Position 3: A (confirmed by CHASM)
- Position 4: S (confirmed by RAISE)
- Positions 2 and 5 are unknown, but must be letters not yet excluded: available letters include D, F, G, K, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that fits the pattern: M _ A S _

Looking for common words:
- MADAS (not valid)
- MAFAS (not valid)
- MAGAS (not valid)
- MANAS (not valid)
- MAPAS (not valid)
- MATAS (valid word meaning ""Spanish dollars"")

MATAS fits the pattern:
- M in position 1 (required)
- A in position 3 (required)
- S in position 4 (required)
- T and A in positions 2 and 5 (both are available letters not yet excluded).

Let's verify:
- Letters used: M, A, T, A, S
- Excluded letters: R, I, E, C, H, L, B
- No excluded letters are used, and the word is valid.

Therefore, MATAS is a good next guess.

1. RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - S is fixed in position 4.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.

   - Confirms S in position 4 and A in position 3.
   - M is in the word but not in position 5.

3. LAMBS → L(x) A(-) M(-) B(x) S(✓)
   - L and B are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2 or 3, so A must be in position 1 or 5.
   - M is in the word but not in position 2 or 5, so M must be in position 1 or 3. Position 3 is now known to be A, so M must be in position 1.

4. MATAS → M(-) A(-) T(x) A(-) S(✓)
   - T is not in the word.
   - M is in the word but not in position 1 (so M must be in position 3 or 5, but position 3 is A, so M must be in position 5).
   - A is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from MATAS feedback), so A must be in position 1 or 5. But position 5 is now known to be M, so A must be in position 1.

So the pattern is now:
- Position 1: A
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: M
- Position 2 is unknown, but must be a letter not yet excluded.

Excluded letters so far: R, I, E, C, H, L, B, T.

Available letters for position 2: D, F, G, K, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit A _ A S M:
- A D A S M (not valid)
- A F A S M (not valid)
- A G A S M (not valid)
- A N A S M (not valid)
- A P A S M (not valid)
- A V A S M (not valid)
- A W A S M (not valid)

The only valid word that fits is ""AGASM"" (a slang term for ""I'm getting sick of this""), but it uses G and S twice, which might not be the case.

Wait, let's think differently - maybe position 2 is a single letter, and the word is A _ A S M. The valid word here is ""AGASM"" but it's obscure.

However, looking at common words, ""AGASM"" seems unlikely. Let me double-check if I missed any.

Another approach: since position 2 is the only unknown, and the word must be A _ A S M, the only valid word is ""AGASM"".

But let's verify:
- A G A S M: letters used are A, G, A, S, M - none are excluded, and it's a valid word (though slang).

Given the constraints, ""AGASM"" is the only possible word left.

However, let's consider if there's an error in our deduction. From MATAS feedback:
- M(-) means M is in the word but not in position 1.
- From earlier, M must be in position 5 (since it can't be 1, 2, or 3, and 5 is the only remaining spot).

Similarly, A must be in position 1 (since it can't be 2, 3, or 4, and 5 is M).

Thus the pattern is A _ A S M, and the only valid word is ""AGASM"".

But position 5 is now known to be M, so A must be in position 1.\n\nSo the pattern is now:\n- Position 1: A\n- Position 3: A\n- Position 4: S\n- Position 5: M\n- Position 2 is unknown, but must be a letter not yet excluded.\n\nExcluded letters so far: R, I, E, C, H, L, B, T.\n\nAvailable letters for position 2: D, F, G, K, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nLooking for common 5-letter words that fit A _ A S M:\n- A D A S M (not valid)\n- A F A S M (not valid)\n- A G A S M (not valid)\n- A N A S M (not valid)\n- A P A S M (not valid)\n- A V A S M (not valid)\n- A W A S M (not valid)\n\nThe only valid word that fits is ""AGASM"" (a slang term for ""I\'m getting sick of this""), but it uses G and S twice, which might not be the case.\n\nWait, let\'s think differently - maybe position 2 is a single letter, and the word is A _ A S M. The valid word here is ""AGASM"" but it\'s obscure.\n\nHowever, looking at common words, ""AGASM"" seems unlikely. Let me double-check if I missed any.\n\nAnother approach: since position 2 is the only unknown, and the word must be A _ A S M, the only valid word is ""AGASM"".\n\nBut let\'s verify:\n- A G A S M: letters used are A, G, A, S, M - none are excluded, and it\'s a valid word (though slang).\n\nGiven the constraints, ""AGASM"" is the only possible word left.\n\nHowever, let\'s consider if there\'s an error in our deduction. From MATAS feedback:\n- M(-) means M is in the word but not in position 1.\n- From earlier, M must be in position 5 (since it can\'t be 1, 2, or 3, and 5 is the only remaining spot).\n\nSimilarly, A must be in position 1 (since it can\'t be 2, 3, or 4, and 5 is M).\n\nThus the pattern is A _ A S M, and the only valid word is ""AGASM"".\n\nBut ""AGASM"" is quite obscure. Let me check again for any other possibilities.\n\nLooking at the pattern A _ A S M, the only valid English word is ""AGASM"".\n\nTherefore, the next guess must be ""AGASM"".\n\n<guess>AGASM</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: CHASM -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) A(✓) S(✓) M(-)\nGuess 3: LAMBS -> FEEDBACK: L(x) A(-) M(-) B(x) S(✓)\nGuess 4: MATAS -> FEEDBACK: M(-) A(-) T(x) A(-) S(✓)\nGuess 5: AGASM -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) G(x) A(✓) S(✓) M(-)\n'}]","<think>
From the latest feedback on AGASM:
- A(✓) : the first letter is A and in the correct position.
- G(x) : G is not in the word at all.
- A(✓) : the third letter is A and in the correct position.
- S(✓) : the fourth letter is S and in the correct position.
- M(-) : M is in the word but not in the fifth position.

So the pattern is now fully determined except for the fifth letter:
A _ A S _

We know M must appear somewhere, but it can't be in position 5 (from AGASM) and we've already placed A in positions 1 and 3, S in position 4. The only remaining spot for M is position 2.

Therefore the word must be A M A S _, but we need a fifth letter. However, position 5 is the only remaining position, and M can't go there (from AGASM), so M must be in position 2.

This gives the pattern: A M A S _

Looking at common 5-letter words that fit A M A S _, the only valid word is ""AMASS"" (which means to pile up or heap).

Let's verify:
- A M A S S
- Letters: A, M, A, S, S
- Excluded letters so far: R, I, E, C, H, L, B, T, G
- None of these letters are used in ""AMASS"", and it's a valid word.

Thus, the secret word must be ""AMASS"".
