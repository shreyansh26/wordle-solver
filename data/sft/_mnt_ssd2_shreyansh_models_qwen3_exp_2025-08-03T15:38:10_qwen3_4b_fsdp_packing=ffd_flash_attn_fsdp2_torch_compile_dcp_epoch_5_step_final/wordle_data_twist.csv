For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help identify which vowels and consonants are in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word and in the correct 4th position (✓).

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ S _

Letters to avoid entirely: A, R, O, E.
Letters confirmed present: S (position 4).
We still need three more letters. Common consonants left include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc., and vowels left are I, U.

A good next guess should test new common letters while keeping S in the 4th spot. ""STUNS"" comes to mind, but it repeats S. Instead, ""SLUSH"" uses S in position 4 and introduces L, U, H. But H is less common. ""SPINS"" repeats S. ""SPURT"" uses S in position 4 but has U and T. 

A better choice might be ""STUMP"" - S is in position 4, and it tests T, U, M, P. But we need to keep S in position 4, so ""STUMP"" would be S T U M P - but S is 1st here, not 4th. 

Wait, we need S in position 4. So the word is _ _ _ S _. Let's think of words fitting that pattern. ""BLISS"" has S in position 4: B L I S S. But it repeats S. ""CLINK"" doesn't have S. ""CHIPS"" has S in position 5. ""SPICY"" has S in position 1. 

Actually, we need S in position 4. So the pattern is _ _ _ S _. Examples: ""BLISS"" (but S is 4th and 5th), ""CHIPS"" (S is 5th), ""PLUSH"" (S is 4th). 

""PLUSH"" seems good: P L U S H. It has S in position 4, introduces P, L, U, H. But H is less common. 

Another option: ""FLISK"" - but K is less common. ""GLISK"" - same. 

""STUMP"" is invalid because S is first. 

""SLUMP"" - S is first. 

""BLUSH"" - S is 4th: B L U S H. This seems good - tests B, L, U, H while keeping S in position 4. 

But maybe ""SLUMP"" isn't the best. Let me think of a word with S in position 4 that uses common letters. ""SLASH"" has S in position 4: S L A S H, but A is already excluded. 

""CLASP"" - C L A S P, A excluded. 

""PLANS"" - P L A N S, A excluded. 

""STAND"" - S T A N D, A excluded. 

""SLINK"" - S L I N K, but S is 1st. 

Wait, we need S in position 4. So the word is _ _ _ S _. 

Good options:
- ""BLUSH"" (B L U S H)
- ""CLINK"" (C L I N K) - but K is less common
- ""PLUSH"" (P L U S H)
- ""SLUSH"" (S L U S H) - but S is 1st and 4th, which might not be optimal

""BLUSH"" seems best as it tests B, L, U, H while keeping S in position 4. 

But let me check if there's a better word. ""SLUM"" is 4 letters. 

Actually, ""FLUSH"" is F L U S H - tests F, L, U, H. 

Between ""BLUSH"" and ""FLUSH"", both are good. I'll go with ""BLUSH"" as it introduces B, L, U, H.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)

   – A, R, O, E are NOT in the word.

   – S is still in the 4th position (✓).  
   – B, L, U, H are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ S _
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, B, L, U, H
- Allowed letters (so far): S is fixed at position 4.
- Still available: C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S as the 4th letter.
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.
- Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

Good candidates:
- C, D, I, N, K, M, P, T are common and still allowed.
- Words like:
  – CINKS (C I N K S) – but K is allowed and S is 4th.
  – DINKS (D I N K S)
  – MINKS (M I N K S)
  – PINKS (P I N K S)
  – STINK (S T I N K) – but S is 1st, not 4th.
  – TINKS (T I N K S) – S is 4th.

“TINKS” fits perfectly: T I N K S, with S in the 4th position, and all letters allowed. It tests T, I, N, K.

Another good option is “MINKS” or “PINKS”, but “TINKS” uses T, which is very common.

I’ll go with TINKS.

- Uses only letters from the allowed set.
- Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

Good candidates:
- C, D, I, N, K, M, P, T are common and still allowed.
- Words like:
  – CINKS (C I N K S) – but K is allowed and S is 4th.
  – DINKS (D I N K S)
  – MINKS (M I N K S)
  – PINKS (P I N K S)
  – STINK (S T I N K) – but S is 1st, not 4th.
  – TINKS (T I N K S) – S is 4th.

“TINKS” fits perfectly: T I N K S, with S in the 4th position, and all letters allowed. It tests T, I, N, K.

Another good option is “MINKS” or “PINKS”, but “TINKS” uses T, which is very common.

I’ll go with TINKS.",Guess 3: TINKS -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) I(-) N(x) K(x) S(-),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help identify which vowels and consonants are in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word and in the correct 4th position (✓).

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ S _

Letters to avoid entirely: A, R, O, E.
Letters confirmed present: S (position 4).
We still need three more letters. Common consonants left include T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc., and vowels left are I, U.

A good next guess should test new common letters while keeping S in the 4th spot. ""STUNS"" comes to mind, but it repeats S. Instead, ""SLUSH"" uses S in position 4 and introduces L, U, H. But H is less common. ""SPINS"" repeats S. ""SPURT"" uses S in position 4 but has U and T. 

A better choice might be ""STUMP"" - S is in position 4, and it tests T, U, M, P. But we need to keep S in position 4, so ""STUMP"" would be S T U M P - but S is 1st here, not 4th. 

Wait, we need S in position 4. So the word is _ _ _ S _. Let's think of words fitting that pattern. ""BLISS"" has S in position 4: B L I S S. But it repeats S. ""CLINK"" doesn't have S. ""CHIPS"" has S in position 5. ""SPICY"" has S in position 1. 

Actually, we need S in position 4. So the pattern is _ _ _ S _. Examples: ""BLISS"" (but S is 4th and 5th), ""CHIPS"" (S is 5th), ""PLUSH"" (S is 4th). 

""PLUSH"" seems good: P L U S H. It has S in position 4, introduces P, L, U, H. But H is less common. 

Another option: ""FLISK"" - but K is less common. ""GLISK"" - same. 

""STUMP"" is invalid because S is first. 

""SLUMP"" - S is first. 

""BLUSH"" - S is 4th: B L U S H. This seems good - tests B, L, U, H while keeping S in position 4. 

But maybe ""SLUMP"" isn't the best. Let me think of a word with S in position 4 that uses common letters. ""SLASH"" has S in position 4: S L A S H, but A is already excluded. 

""CLASP"" - C L A S P, A excluded. 

""PLANS"" - P L A N S, A excluded. 

""STAND"" - S T A N D, A excluded. 

""SLINK"" - S L I N K, but S is 1st. 

Wait, we need S in position 4. So the word is _ _ _ S _. 

Good options:
- ""BLUSH"" (B L U S H)
- ""CLINK"" (C L I N K) - but K is less common
- ""PLUSH"" (P L U S H)
- ""SLUSH"" (S L U S H) - but S is 1st and 4th, which might not be optimal

""BLUSH"" seems best as it tests B, L, U, H while keeping S in position 4. 

But let me check if there's a better word. ""SLUM"" is 4 letters. 

Actually, ""FLUSH"" is F L U S H - tests F, L, U, H. 

Between ""BLUSH"" and ""FLUSH"", both are good. I'll go with ""BLUSH"" as it introduces B, L, U, H. 

But wait, is ""BLUSH"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes. 

So my next guess is ""BLUSH"".

Here is some previous feedback:

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
   – S is in the word and is in the 4th position (✓).  
   – A, R, O, E are NOT in the word.

2. BLUSH → B(x) L(x) U(x) S(✓) H(x)  
   – S is still in the 4th position (✓).  
   – B, L, U, H are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ S _
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, B, L, U, H
- Allowed letters (so far): S is fixed at position 4.
- Still available: C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S as the 4th letter.
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.
- Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

Good candidates:
- C, D, I, N, K, M, P, T are common and still allowed.
- Words like:

  – PINKS (P I N K S)
  – STINK (S T I N K) – but S is 1st, not 4th.
  – TINKS (T I N K S) – S is 4th.

“TINKS” fits perfectly: T I N K S, with S in the 4th position, and all letters allowed. It tests T, I, N, K.

Another good option is “MINKS” or “PINKS”, but “TINKS” uses T, which is very common.

Let’s parse the new feedback:

TINKS → T(✓) I(-) N(x) K(x) S(-)

- T is in the word and in the correct 1st position (✓).  
- I is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (-).  
- N and K are NOT in the word (x).  
- S is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (-).  

But wait: earlier feedback said S is definitely in the word and in the 4th position (from AROSE and BLUSH).  
Now the feedback for TINKS shows S(-) meaning S is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.  
This is consistent with S being in the 4th position (since the 5th position is different).

So the pattern is now:
T _ _ S _

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, E, B, L, U, H, N, K  
Allowed letters (still): C, D, F, G, I, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We know:
- 1st letter: T
- 4th letter: S
- 2nd letter: not I (from TINKS feedback: I(-))
- 2nd letter: not any of the forbidden letters

We need a 5-letter word starting with T, ending with S, with I somewhere else (since I is in the word but not in position 2), and using only allowed letters.

Possible middle letters (positions 2 and 3) must be from allowed letters and not N, K, etc.

Let’s think of words fitting T _ _ S _ with I somewhere:

- T I _ S _ : but I cannot be in position 2 (from TINKS feedback), so this is invalid.
- T _ I S _ : possible. Need a letter in position 2 that is allowed and not forbidden.
- T _ _ S I : possible, but I is already known to be in the word (from TINKS: I(-)), so this could work.

But let’s check possible words:

Looking for T _ _ S _ with allowed letters:

- T I M S _ : but I cannot be in position 2.
- T I G S _ : same issue.
- T I C S _ : same.
- T I P S _ : same.
- T I M S _ : same.

Wait, perhaps I is in position 5? But the word ends with S, so position 5 is S.

So I must be in position 3: T _ I S _

Looking for T _ I S _:

- T O I S _ : but O is forbidden.
- T A I S _ : A is forbidden.
- T U I S _ : U is forbidden.
- T E I S _ : E is forbidden.
- T R I S _ : R is forbidden.
- T L I S _ : L is forbidden.
- T B I S _ : B is forbidden.
- T H I S _ : H is forbidden.
- T N I S _ : N is forbidden.
- T K I S _ : K is forbidden.

So I cannot be in position 3 either because the required letters are forbidden.

Next possibility: I is in position 2, but feedback said I is not in position 2 (I(-) in TINKS). So I cannot be in position 2.

This leaves only one possibility: I must be in position 5, but position 5 is S (from TINKS feedback: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 5, but we already know S must be in position 4. So this is consistent, but I cannot be in position 5 because the word ends with S.

This seems like a contradiction. Let me re-examine:

From TINKS feedback:
- T(✓) → T is correct in position 1.
- I(-) → I is in the word but not in position 2.
- N(x), K(x) → not in word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 5 (but we know S must be in position 4, so this is consistent).

So the word is T _ _ S _, with I somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (but 5 is S), so I must be in position 3.

Thus the pattern is T _ I S _

But looking at allowed letters for position 2 and 3:

Position 2: any allowed letter except forbidden ones (A, R, O, E, B, L, U, H, N, K)
Allowed: C, D, F, G, I, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Position 3: must be I (from above reasoning), but let’s check if any of these letters conflict.

Possible word: T C I S _ → but we need a 5-letter word. The only possible completion is T C I S _, but this is not a valid word.

Looking through valid words starting with T, ending with S, with I in position 3:

- T W I S T → but T is already in position 1 and cannot repeat (since feedback only shows one T confirmed).
- T H I S T → H is forbidden.
- T R I S T → R is forbidden.
- T I G S T → I in position 2 is invalid (from TINKS feedback).
- T I M S T → same issue.

This seems problematic. Let me think differently: perhaps the word is T I _ S _ but I is not in position 2, which contradicts the feedback.

Wait, the feedback says I is in the word but not in position 2. So I could be in position 3 or 5. Position 5 is S, so I must be in position 3. Thus the word must be T _ I S _.

But we need a valid 5-letter word T _ I S _ with allowed letters. The only common word fitting this is T W I S T, but T is already in position 1 and cannot repeat (since feedback only shows one T confirmed). 

Another possibility: T I M S _ → but I cannot be in position 2.

This suggests I might have made an error. Let me re-examine allowed letters and possibilities.

Actually, the word could be T I G S _ but this is not valid. 

Looking at valid English words starting with T and ending with S, with I somewhere:

- T I M E S → but E is forbidden and ends with S, but this is 5 letters: T I M E S → but S is 5th, and E is forbidden.
- T I N G S → N is forbidden.
- T I P S → too short.
- T I R E S → R and E are forbidden.
- T I G S → too short.
- T I P S → too short.
- T I N S → too short.

This is tricky. Let me think of other possibilities. Perhaps the word is T _ _ S _ with I in position 2, but feedback says I is not in position 2. 

This seems like a dead end. Let me check if I missed any allowed letters.

Allowed letters: C, D, F, G, I, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible combinations for T _ _ S _:

- T C _ S _ → T C O S _ but O is forbidden.
- T D _ S _ → T D I S _ → T D I S _ is not a word.
- T F _ S _ → T F I S _ → not a word.
- T G _ S _ → T G I S _ → not a word.
- T I _ S _ → but I cannot be in position 2.
- T M _ S _ → T M I S _ → not a word.
- T P _ S _ → T P I S _ → not a word.
- T V _ S _ → T V I S _ → not a word.
- T W _ S _ → T W I S _ → not a word.
- T X _ S _ → not relevant.
- T Y _ S _ → not relevant.
- T Z _ S _ → not relevant.

This suggests the only possible word is T W I S T, but T repeats. Since feedback only shows one T confirmed, this might be possible, but it’s unusual.

Alternatively, perhaps the word is T I G S _ but this is not valid. 

I realize I might have missed T I M E S, but it ends with S and has E which is forbidden.

Another possibility: T I M B S → but B is forbidden.

This seems impossible. Let me re-examine the feedback interpretation.

From TINKS:
- T(✓) → T is correct in position 1.
- I(-) → I is in the word but not in position 2.
- N(x), K(x) → not in word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 5 (but we know S must be in position 4, so this is consistent).

Thus the word is T _ _ S _, with I in position 3 or 5 (but 5 is S), so I must be in position 3. Thus T _ I S _.

The only valid word fitting this is T W I S T, but T is already in position 1. However, the feedback only confirms one T, so this might be acceptable.

Therefore, the next guess is T W I S T.

But let me check if there are other words. 

Looking at T _ I S _:
- T W I S T → valid word, but T repeats.
- T H I S T → H is forbidden.
- T R I S T → R is forbidden.
- T I G S T → I in position 2 is invalid.
- T I M S T → I in position 2 is invalid.

Thus, the only possible word seems to be T W I S T, despite the T repeat.

But let me think if there are other possibilities. 

Another approach: perhaps the word is T _ _ S I, but this contradicts S being in position 4.

This seems to lead me back to T W I S T as the only possibility.

However, T W I S T is a valid word, and even though T repeats, the feedback only confirmed one T, so this might be the intended word.

Thus, the next guess is T W I S T.
</think>

From the feedback:
- T is fixed in position 1.
- S is fixed in position 4.
- I is in the word but not in position 2.
- N and K are not in the word.
- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, E, B, L, U, H, N, K.

The only remaining valid pattern is T _ I S _, and the only common 5-letter word fitting this is **TWIST** (T W I S T). Although T repeats, the feedback only confirmed one T in position 1, so this is acceptable.

<guess>TWIST</guess>",TWIST,"Let’s parse the new feedback:

TINKS → T(✓) I(-) N(x) K(x) S(-)

- T is in the word and in the correct 1st position (✓).  
- I is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (-).  
- N and K are NOT in the word (x).  
- S is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (-).  

But wait: earlier feedback said S is definitely in the word and in the 4th position (from AROSE and BLUSH).  
Now the feedback for TINKS shows S(-) meaning S is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.  
This is consistent with S being in the 4th position (since the 5th position is different).

So the pattern is now:
T _ _ S _

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, E, B, L, U, H, N, K

- T I M S _ : but I cannot be in position 2.
- T I G S _ : same issue.
- T I C S _ : same.
- T I P S _ : same.

Wait, perhaps I is in position 5? But the word ends with S, so position 5 is S.

So I must be in position 3: T _ I S _

Looking for T _ I S _:

- T O I S _ : but O is forbidden.
- T A I S _ : A is forbidden.
- T U I S _ : U is forbidden.
- T E I S _ : E is forbidden.
- T R I S _ : R is forbidden.
- T L I S _ : L is forbidden.
- T B I S _ : B is forbidden.
- T H I S _ : H is forbidden.
- T N I S _ : N is forbidden.
- T K I S _ : K is forbidden.

So I cannot be in position 3 either because the required letters are forbidden.

Next possibility: I is in position 2, but feedback said I is not in position 2 (I(-) in TINKS). So I cannot be in position 2.

This leaves only one possibility: I must be in position 5, but position 5 is S (from TINKS feedback: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 5, but we already know S must be in position 4. So this is consistent, but I cannot be in position 5 because the word ends with S.

This seems like a contradiction. Let me re-examine:

From TINKS feedback:
- T(✓) → T is correct in position 1.
- I(-) → I is in the word but not in position 2.
- N(x), K(x) → not in word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 5 (but we know S must be in position 4, so this is consistent).

So the word is T _ _ S _, with I somewhere in positions 3 or 5 (but 5 is S), so I must be in position 3.

Thus the pattern is T _ I S _

But looking at allowed letters for position 2 and 3:

Position 2: any allowed letter except forbidden ones (A, R, O, E, B, L, U, H, N, K)
Allowed: C, D, F, G, I, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Position 3: must be I (from above reasoning), but let’s check if any of these letters conflict.

Possible word: T C I S _ → but we need a 5-letter word. The only possible completion is T C I S _, but this is not a valid word.

Looking through valid words starting with T, ending with S, with I in position 3:

- T W I S T → but T is already in position 1 and cannot repeat (since feedback only shows one T confirmed).
- T H I S T → H is forbidden.
- T R I S T → R is forbidden.
- T I G S T → I in position 2 is invalid (from TINKS feedback).
- T I M S T → same issue.

This seems problematic. Let me think differently: perhaps the word is T I _ S _ but I is not in position 2, which contradicts the feedback.

Wait, the feedback says I is in the word but not in position 2. So I could be in position 3 or 5. Position 5 is S, so I must be in position 3. Thus the word must be T _ I S _.

But we need a valid 5-letter word T _ I S _ with allowed letters. The only common word fitting this is T W I S T, but T is already in position 1 and cannot repeat (since feedback only shows one T confirmed). 

Another possibility: T I M S _ → but I cannot be in position 2.

This suggests I might have made an error. Let me re-examine allowed letters and possibilities.

Actually, the word could be T I G S _ but this is not valid. 

Looking at valid English words starting with T and ending with S, with I somewhere:

- T I M E S → but E is forbidden and ends with S, but this is 5 letters: T I M E S → but S is 5th, and E is forbidden.
- T I N G S → N is forbidden.
- T I P S → too short.
- T I R E S → R and E are forbidden.
- T I G S → too short.
- T I P S → too short.
- T I N S → too short.

This is tricky. Let me think of other possibilities. Perhaps the word is T _ _ S _ with I in position 2, but feedback says I is not in position 2. 

This seems like a dead end. Let me check if I missed any allowed letters.

Allowed letters: C, D, F, G, I, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Possible combinations for T _ _ S _:

- T C _ S _ → T C O S _ but O is forbidden.
- T D _ S _ → T D I S _ → T D I S _ is not a word.
- T F _ S _ → T F I S _ → not a word.
- T G _ S _ → T G I S _ → not a word.
- T I _ S _ → but I cannot be in position 2.
- T M _ S _ → T M I S _ → not a word.
- T P _ S _ → T P I S _ → not a word.
- T V _ S _ → T V I S _ → not a word.
- T W _ S _ → T W I S _ → not a word.
- T X _ S _ → not relevant.
- T Y _ S _ → not relevant.
- T Z _ S _ → not relevant.

This suggests the only possible word is T W I S T, but T repeats. Since feedback only shows one T confirmed, this might be possible, but it’s unusual.

Alternatively, perhaps the word is T I G S _ but this is not valid. 

I realize I might have missed T I M E S, but it ends with S and has E which is forbidden.

Another possibility: T I M B S → but B is forbidden.

This seems impossible. Let me re-examine the feedback interpretation.

From TINKS:
- T(✓) → T is correct in position 1.
- I(-) → I is in the word but not in position 2.
- N(x), K(x) → not in word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 5 (but we know S must be in position 4, so this is consistent).

Thus the word is T _ _ S _, with I in position 3 or 5 (but 5 is S), so I must be in position 3. Thus T _ I S _.

The only valid word fitting this is T W I S T, but T is already in position 1. However, the feedback only confirms one T, so this might be acceptable.

Therefore, the next guess is T W I S T.

But let me check if there are other words. 

Looking at T _ I S _:
- T W I S T → valid word, but T repeats.
- T H I S T → H is forbidden.
- T R I S T → R is forbidden.
- T I G S T → I in position 2 is invalid.
- T I M S T → I in position 2 is invalid.

Thus, the only possible word seems to be T W I S T, despite the T repeat.

But let me think if there are other possibilities. 

Another approach: perhaps the word is T _ _ S I, but this contradicts S being in position 4.

This seems to lead me back to T W I S T as the only possibility.

However, T W I S T is a valid word, and even though T repeats, the feedback only confirmed one T, so this might be the intended word.

Thus, the next guess is T W I S T.From the feedback:
- T is fixed in position 1.
- S is fixed in position 4.
- I is in the word but not in position 2.
- N and K are not in the word.
- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, E, B, L, U, H, N, K.

The only remaining valid pattern is T _ I S _, and the only common 5-letter word fitting this is **TWIST** (T W I S T). Although T repeats, the feedback only confirmed one T in position 1, so this is acceptable.",Guess 4: TWIST -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) W(✓) I(✓) S(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
