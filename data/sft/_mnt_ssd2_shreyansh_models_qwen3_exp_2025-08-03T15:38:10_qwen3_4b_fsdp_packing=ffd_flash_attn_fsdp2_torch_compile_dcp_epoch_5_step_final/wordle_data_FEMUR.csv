For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E
- ""RAISE"" covers R, A, I, S, E
- ""AROSE"" covers A, R, O, S, E

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good information about which vowels are in the word and whether R or S are present.

From the feedback on RAISE:

- A is not in the word
- I is not in the word
- S is not in the word
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so E is not in position 5)

So we know:
- The word contains R and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively
- The word does not contain A, I, or S

We need a 5-letter word that:

- Uses only the remaining letters

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A and I are out, and E is confirmed)

Let's try a word like ""TOWER"":
- T: new letter
- O: new vowel
- W: new consonant
- E: confirmed in word (position 4 here)
- R: confirmed in word (position 5 here)

Check positions:
- R was in position 1 in RAISE, so position 5 is allowed
- E was in position 5 in RAISE, so position 4 is allowed

This seems like a good second guess to test new letters while respecting the constraints.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, I, S, T, O, W  
2. Letters that ARE in the word:  
   - R (now confirmed in position 5)  
   - E (somewhere, but NOT in position 4 or 5)  

So the pattern so far is:  
_ _ _ _ R  
with E somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.  

Remaining common consonants we haven’t tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: U (since A, I, O are out and E is already in).

We need a word that:
- Ends in R  
- Contains E in position 1, 2, or 3  
- Uses only letters from the allowed set  

A quick scan of common 5-letter words ending in R with E in the middle gives “BERET” (but A is out), “PERKY” (ends Y), “NERVE” (ends E), etc.  
The word “PERKY” doesn’t fit because it ends in Y, not R.  
The word “NERVE” ends in E, not R.  

A better candidate is “CUBER”:
- Ends in R (✓)  
- Has E in position 4 → but E cannot be in 4 or 5 (from feedback) → invalid.  

Next: “FURER” – but U is allowed, and E is in position 3.  
Letters: F, U, R, E, R → R is already in position 5, so this repeats R unnecessarily.  

A cleaner choice is “HUMER” – but this is not a standard English word.  

A valid common word is “PERCH” – but ends in H.  

Actually, let’s list valid words ending in R with E in 1-3:
- BERET (A is out)  
- CEREB (not common)  
- DERBY (ends Y)  
- FEROC (ends C)  
- GERMS (ends S)  
- MERGE (ends E)  
- PERIL (ends L)  
- SERFS (ends S)  

The only valid common word that fits is “MERGE” – but it ends in E, not R.  

Re-evaluate: we need E in 1-3 and R in 5.  
Valid words:
- BERRY (E in 2) – but has two R’s.  
- CERRY (E in 2) – but Y is allowed.  
- FERRY (E in 2) – ends Y.  
- HERRY (not a word).  

Wait, “CERRY” is a valid word (a red sweet).  
- C, E, R, R, Y → ends in R (position 5) and E in 2.  
- Letters: C, E, R, Y – all allowed.  

This seems like the best fit.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" covers S, L, A, T, E
- ""CRANE"" covers C, R, A, N, E
- ""RAISE"" covers R, A, I, S, E
- ""AROSE"" covers A, R, O, S, E

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good information about which vowels are in the word and whether R or S are present.

- E: confirmed in word (position 4 here)
- R: confirmed in word (position 5 here)

Check positions:
- R was in position 1 in RAISE, so position 5 is allowed
- E was in position 5 in RAISE, so position 4 is allowed

This seems like a good second guess to test new letters while respecting the constraints.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, I, S, T, O, W  
2. Letters that ARE in the word:  
   - R (now confirmed in position 5)  
   - E (somewhere, but NOT in position 4 or 5)  

So the pattern so far is:  
_ _ _ _ R  
with E somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.  

Remaining common consonants we haven’t tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: U (since A, I, O are out and E is already in).

We need a word that:
- Ends in R  
- Contains E in position 1, 2, or 3  
- Uses only letters from the allowed set  

A quick scan of common 5-letter words ending in R with E in the middle gives “BERET” (but A is out), “PERKY” (ends Y), “NERVE” (ends E), etc.  
The word “PERKY” doesn’t fit because it ends in Y, not R.  
The word “NERVE” ends in E, not R.  

A better candidate is “CUBER”:
- Ends in R (✓)  
- Has E in position 4 → but E cannot be in 4 or 5 (from feedback) → invalid.  

Next: “FURER” – but U is allowed, and E is in position 3.  
Letters: F, U, R, E, R → R is already in position 5, so this repeats R unnecessarily.  

A cleaner choice is “HUMER” – but this is not a standard English word.  

A valid common word is “PERCH” – but ends in H.  

Actually, let’s list valid words ending in R with E in 1-3:
- BERET (A is out)  
- CEREB (not common)  
- DERBY (ends Y)  
- FEROC (ends C)  
- GERMS (ends S)  
- MERGE (ends E)  
- PERIL (ends L)  
- SERFS (ends S)  

The only valid common word that fits is “MERGE” – but it ends in E, not R.  

Re-evaluate: we need E in 1-3 and R in 5.  
Valid words:
- BERRY (E in 2) – but has two R’s.  
- CERRY (E in 2) – but Y is allowed.  
- FERRY (E in 2) – ends Y.  
- HERRY (not a word).  

Wait, “CERRY” is a valid word (a red sweet).  
- C, E, R, R, Y → ends in R (position 5) and E in 2.  
- Letters: C, E, R, Y – all allowed.  

This seems like the best fit.

Let's update what we know after the three guesses.

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
   A, I, S, T, O, W, C, Y

2. Letters that ARE in the word:  
   - E (now confirmed in position 2)  
   - R (must appear at least once; we have seen it marked as “-” or “✓” in positions 1, 5, 3, 4.  
     From the feedback:  
     - Guess 1 (RAISE): R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 1  
     - Guess 2 (TOWER): R(✓) → R is in position 5  
     - Guess 3 (CERRY): R(-) and R(-) → the two R’s are both in wrong positions (positions 3 and 4).  
     Therefore, R must be in position 5 (already confirmed) and cannot appear elsewhere.

3. Current pattern:  
   _ E _ _ R

4. Remaining unused letters (common ones):  
   B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, X, Z

5. We need a valid 5-letter word that:  
   - Has E in position 2  
   - Has R in position 5  
   - Uses only the allowed letters (no A, I, S, T, O, W, C, Y)  
   - Uses only the remaining consonants and U as the only other vowel.
