### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting letters include S, T, A, R, E, etc. A good starting word should also cover a variety of vowels and consonants. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every word that contains any of those letters.  
To maximize information on the next guess, we should pick a word made entirely from the remaining unused letters.  
Common remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Common remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A good second-guess word that uses several of these remaining letters is “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D — none of these appeared in the first guess, so they’re all still possible.

Letters known to be in the word but whose positions are still uncertain:  
R, O

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains both R and O  
- does not contain any of the 12 eliminated letters  
- places R and O in new positions (since both have appeared as “-” in earlier guesses)

Remaining consonants: B, C, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Remaining vowel: I (since A, E, U are out, and O is already present)

Let’s try to place R and O in new spots while introducing fresh letters.  
A promising pattern is to put O in position 3 (middle) and R in position 4, and fill the rest with new consonants.  
Candidate: “BROCK”  
- B, C, K are new letters.  
- R in position 4 (new for R).  
- O in position 2 (new for O).  
- No forbidden letters.

This seems like a good probe.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting letters include S, T, A, R, E, etc. A good starting word should also cover a variety of vowels and consonants. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every word that contains any of those letters.  
To maximize information on the next guess, we should pick a word made entirely from the remaining unused letters.  
Common remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Common remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A good second-guess word that uses several of these remaining letters is “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D — none of these appeared in the first guess, so they’re all still possible.
- It tests two new vowels (O, U) and three new consonants (R, N, D).

<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
   Eliminates S, L, A, T, E entirely.

2. ROUND → R(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)  
   - R and O are in the word but in the wrong positions.  
   - U, N, D are not in the word.

So far:
- Letters known to be in the word: R, O  
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R and O (and possibly other letters not yet ruled out).  
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, E, U, N, D.

Remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I (O is already confirmed, so we might need I or another O)

Let’s try to place R and O in new positions while introducing fresh letters.  
A good candidate is “FORGY”:
- F, G, Y are new letters not yet tested.  
- O and R are placed in positions they haven’t occupied before (O in 1st, R in 2nd).  
- No disallowed letters appear.
