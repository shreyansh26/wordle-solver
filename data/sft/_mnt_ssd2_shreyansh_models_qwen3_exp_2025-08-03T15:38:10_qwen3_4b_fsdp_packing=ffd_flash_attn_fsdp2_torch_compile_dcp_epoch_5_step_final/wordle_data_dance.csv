### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm several possibilities at once. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 of these common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This will give us maximum feedback about which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and E which are very common vowels. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (positions 2,3,4,5 are wrong).
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains A somewhere in positions 1,3,4 (since position 2 is wrong).
- It does NOT contain R, O, or S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that has an A in positions 1,3, or 4 and avoids R, O, S. Let’s brainstorm possibilities:

- If A is in position 1: A _ _ _ E → e.g., ARISE (but has R, so no), APEX (but 4 letters), AMPLE (but has P and L), ANGLE (has N, G, L)
- If A is in position 3: _ _ A _ E → e.g., PLAINE (but has I and N), CAKE (4 letters), GNAWE (has G, N, W)
- If A is in position 4: _ _ _ A E → e.g., CHAFE (has C, H, F), GRAPE (has R, so no), PLANE (has P, L, N)

""AMPLE"" seems good - it ends with E, has A in position 2 (but position 2 is wrong for A, so no). ""ANGLE"" has A in position 3 - that's allowed. ""ANGLE"" also avoids R, O, S.

Another candidate: ""CHAFE"" - ends with E, has A in position 4, no R/O/S.

Between these, ""CHAFE"" seems strong as it tests new letters (C, H, F) while fitting all constraints.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S are excluded.

2. CHAFE → C(-) H(x) A(-) F(x) E(✓)
   - E is still correct in position 5.
   - A is in the word but not in positions 1, 3.
   - C and F are in the word but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively (they’re in the wrong place).
   - H is excluded.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains A (positions 2 or 4).
- Contains C and F (but C not in position 1, F not in position 4).
- Excludes: R, O, S, H, F (wait, F is included but in wrong position, so exclude is wrong).

Wait, let me rephrase the constraints correctly:

From CHAFE:
- C(-): C is in the word but not in position 1.
- H(x): H is not in the word.
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 3.
- F(x): F is not in the word.
- E(✓): E is correct in position 5.

So the word must:
- end with E
- contain A (positions 2 or 4)
- contain C (positions 2,3,4,5 but 5 is E, so 2,3,4)
- not contain R, O, S, H, F

Possible letters left: A, C, E (fixed), plus other consonants not yet excluded.

Let’s list possible patterns:

Case 1: A in position 2
Pattern: _ A _ _ E
We need C in positions 3 or 4 (since it can’t be 1 or 5).
- C in 3: _ A C _ E → e.g., BACNE (but B and N are allowed), DANCE (but S is excluded), MACNE (invalid), LANCE (L and N allowed)
- C in 4: _ A _ C E → e.g., BAGCE (invalid), LANCE (but C is 4, so L A N C E) – but LANCE has A in 2, C in 4, which fits.

Case 2: A in position 4
Pattern: _ _ _ A E
C must be in positions 2 or 3 (can’t be 4 because A is there, and can’t be 5 because E is there).
- C in 2: _ C _ A E → e.g., B C _ A E → B C N A E (but N is allowed), D C N A E (D and N allowed)
- C in 3: _ _ C A E → e.g., B L C A E (but L and B allowed), D L C A E

Looking at valid words:
- LANCE: L A N C E – A in 2, C in 4, ends with E, no excluded letters.
- DANCE: D A N C E – but S is excluded (from AROSE feedback), but DANCE has S? No, DANCE is D A N C E – no S, so this is possible.
- BACNE: B A C N E – but F is excluded, but BACNE is a word (though rare).

Between LANCE and DANCE, LANCE seems more common.

Let’s verify:
- LANCE: L(?) A(2) N(?) C(4) E(5)
   - C is allowed in position 4 (from CHAFE feedback: C is in word but not position 1 – 4 is fine).
   - A is allowed in position 2 (from AROSE: A is in word but not 1; from CHAFE: A is in word but not 3 – 2 is fine).
   - No R, O, S, H, F – LANCE has none of these.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm several possibilities at once. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 of these common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This will give us maximum feedback about which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and E which are very common vowels. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (positions 2,3,4,5 are wrong).
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains A somewhere in positions 1,3,4 (since position 2 is wrong).
- It does NOT contain R, O, or S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that has an A in positions 1,3, or 4 and avoids R, O, S. Let’s brainstorm possibilities:

- If A is in position 1: A _ _ _ E → e.g., ARISE (but has R, so no), APEX (but 4 letters), AMPLE (but has P and L), ANGLE (has N, G, L)
- If A is in position 3: _ _ A _ E → e.g., PLAINE (but has I and N), CAKE (4 letters), GNAWE (has G, N, W)
- If A is in position 4: _ _ _ A E → e.g., CHAFE (has C, H, F), GRAPE (has R, so no), PLANE (has P, L, N)

""AMPLE"" seems good - it ends with E, has A in position 2 (but position 2 is wrong for A, so no). ""ANGLE"" has A in position 3 - that's allowed. ""ANGLE"" also avoids R, O, S.

Another candidate: ""CHAFE"" - ends with E, has A in position 4, no R/O/S.

Between these, ""CHAFE"" seems strong as it tests new letters (C, H, F) while fitting all constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: CHAFE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) H(x) A(-) F(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S are excluded.

2. CHAFE → C(-) H(x) A(-) F(x) E(✓)
   - E is still correct in position 5.
   - A is in the word but not in positions 1, 3.
   - C and F are in the word but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively (they’re in the wrong place).
   - H is excluded.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains A (positions 2 or 4).
- Contains C and F (but C not in position 1, F not in position 4).
- Excludes: R, O, S, H, F (wait, F is included but in wrong position, so exclude is wrong).

Wait, let me rephrase the constraints correctly:

From CHAFE:
- C(-): C is in the word but not in position 1.
- H(x): H is not in the word.
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 3.
- F(x): F is not in the word.
- E(✓): E is correct in position 5.

So the word must:
- end with E
- contain A (positions 2 or 4)
- contain C (positions 2,3,4,5 but 5 is E, so 2,3,4)
- not contain R, O, S, H, F

Possible letters left: A, C, E (fixed), plus other consonants not yet excluded.

Let’s list possible patterns:

Case 1: A in position 2
Pattern: _ A _ _ E
We need C in positions 3 or 4 (since it can’t be 1 or 5).
- C in 3: _ A C _ E → e.g., BACNE (but B and N are allowed), DANCE (but S is excluded), MACNE (invalid), LANCE (L and N allowed)
- C in 4: _ A _ C E → e.g., BAGCE (invalid), LANCE (but C is 4, so L A N C E) – but LANCE has A in 2, C in 4, which fits.

Case 2: A in position 4
Pattern: _ _ _ A E
C must be in positions 2 or 3 (can’t be 4 because A is there, and can’t be 5 because E is there).
- C in 2: _ C _ A E → e.g., B C _ A E → B C N A E (but N is allowed), D C N A E (D and N allowed)
- C in 3: _ _ C A E → e.g., B L C A E (but L and B allowed), D L C A E

Looking at valid words:
- LANCE: L A N C E – A in 2, C in 4, ends with E, no excluded letters.
- DANCE: D A N C E – but S is excluded (from AROSE feedback), but DANCE has S? No, DANCE is D A N C E – no S, so this is possible.
- BACNE: B A C N E – but F is excluded, but BACNE is a word (though rare).

Between LANCE and DANCE, LANCE seems more common.

Let’s verify:
- LANCE: L(?) A(2) N(?) C(4) E(5)
   - C is allowed in position 4 (from CHAFE feedback: C is in word but not position 1 – 4 is fine).
   - A is allowed in position 2 (from AROSE: A is in word but not 1; from CHAFE: A is in word but not 3 – 2 is fine).
   - No R, O, S, H, F – LANCE has none of these.

Therefore, LANCE is a valid next guess.
