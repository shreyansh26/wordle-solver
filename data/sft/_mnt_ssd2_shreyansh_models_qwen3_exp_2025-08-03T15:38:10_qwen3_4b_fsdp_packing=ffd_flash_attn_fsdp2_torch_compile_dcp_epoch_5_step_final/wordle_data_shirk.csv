2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 of these common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants well. This will give us good feedback on multiple fronts.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A (x) → A is NOT in the word.

- O (x) → O is NOT in the word.
- S (-) → S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the secret word:
- Contains R and S.
- Does NOT contain A, O, or E.
- R is not in position 2, S is not in position 4.

1. Uses R and S in new positions.
2. Adds new common consonants and vowels (I, U, T, L, N, etc.).
3. Avoids A, O, E.

A good candidate is “TRUST”:
- T, U, S, T: introduces T, U, S (S moves from position 4 to 3).
- R moves from position 2 to 4 (which is allowed since R is not in position 2).
- No A, O, E.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, U  
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still uncertain: R, S  
   - R is not in position 2 (from arose) and not in position 2 again (from trust) – so R ≠ 2.  
   - S is not in position 4 (from arose) and not in position 4 again (from trust) – so S ≠ 4.

We still need to place R and S somewhere else, and we have not yet tested the remaining common letters: I, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Include R and S in new positions (R not 2, S not 4).  
- Use fresh, common letters.  
- Avoid the eliminated set {A, O, E, T, U}.

Let’s try “CRISP”:
- C, I, S, P, P  
  – Places S in position 3 (allowed).  
  – Places R nowhere, but that’s fine because we can still test other positions for R.  
  – Uses new letters C, I, P.

Actually, we need to include R since we know it’s in the word.  
Let’s instead try “PRISM”:
- P, R, I, S, M  
  – R is in position 2 (but we know R is NOT in position 2) → conflict.  
  So PRISM is invalid.

Next try “DRIPS”:
- D, R, I, P, S  
  – R is in position 2 (again invalid).  

Try “CRISP” again but that omits R. We must include R.

Try “RISPS”:
- R, I, S, P, S  
  – R is in position 1 (allowed).  
  – S is in positions 3 and 5 (both allowed).  
  – Uses I, P.  

This seems valid.

But let’s pick a word that spreads R and S across more positions to maximize info.  
Try “CRISP” again but with R: impossible, only 5 letters.

Wait, let’s list valid positions:
- R can be 1, 3, 4, 5 (not 2).  
- S can be 1, 2, 3, 5 (not 4).

Let’s pick a word that places R and S in two different positions.  
How about “SPRIG”:
- S, P, R, I, G  
  – S in 1 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed).  
  – Uses P, I, G.  

This looks good.

Another candidate: “GRIPS”:
- G, R, I, P, S  
  – R in 2 (invalid).  

“CRISP” again omits R, so discard.

“DRIPS” has R in 2 (invalid).  

“PRISM” has R in 2 (invalid).  

“RIPSS” is invalid (double S).  

“SPIRE” is invalid (E already out).  

“SPIRS” is invalid (double S).

Therefore, I’ll guess SPRIG.

- R can be 1, 3, 4, 5 (not 2).  
- S can be 1, 2, 3, 5 (not 4).

Let’s pick a word that places R and S in two different positions.  
How about “SPRIG”:
- S, P, R, I, G  
  – S in 1 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed).  
  – Uses P, I, G.  

This looks good.

Another candidate: “GRIPS”:
- G, R, I, P, S  
  – R in 2 (invalid).  

“CRISP” again omits R, so discard.

“DRIPS” has R in 2 (invalid).  

“PRISM” has R in 2 (invalid).  

“RIPSS” is invalid (double S).  

“SPIRE” is invalid (E already out).

“SPRIG” seems the best among the valid options.

Therefore, I’ll guess SPRIG.

From the new feedback on SPRIG:

- S(✓) – S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).

- R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- I(-) – I is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- G(x) – G is NOT in the word.

Summary of what we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, U, P, G  
Letters that ARE in the word and whose positions are fixed or partially constrained:
- S is fixed in position 1.
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from arose and trust) and NOT in position 3 (from sprig) → R must be in position 4 or 5.
- I is in the word but NOT in position 4 → I must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

We still need to test the remaining common letters: N, L, C, D, M, F, H, etc.

We have the pattern:
1: S
2: ?
3: ?
4: ?
5: ?

Constraints:
- R must be in position 4 or 5.
- I must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (but must not conflict with R).

Let’s try placing R in position 4 and I in position 2:
S I _ R _

We need two more letters from the remaining unused pool (avoiding A, O, E, T, U, P, G). Common choices: N, L, C, D, M, etc.

Let’s pick a word that fits S I _ R _ and uses common letters. One possibility is ""SIRRA"" but that repeats R which we already know is in the word. Another is ""SIRKS"" but K hasn't been tested yet. However, we need to avoid letters already ruled out.

A better choice is ""SILKY"" but Y hasn't been tested and we don't know if it's allowed. Let's stick with common letters.

Let's try ""SIRKS"":
- S I R K S
- R is in position 3 which conflicts with our constraint that R is NOT in position 3. So invalid.

Next, try ""SILKS"":
- S I L K S
- R isn't in this word, but we know R must be in the word. So invalid.

We need R in position 4 or 5. Let's try R in position 5:
S _ _ _ R

I must be in position 2, 3, or 5. Position 5 is R, so I must be in 2 or 3.

Option 1: I in position 2:
S I _ _ R

We need two more letters from the remaining pool. Let's try common letters: N, L, C, D, M, etc.

Possible word: ""SINCR"" – but that's not a valid English word.
""SILVR"" – V hasn't been tested but R is in position 5, which is allowed.
""SILVR"" is valid.

Option 2: I in position 3:
S _ I _ R

Possible word: ""SKINT"" – but T is already out.
""SKUNK"" – U is out.
""SKINS"" – S is already in position 1, but we can have S twice? The rules don't forbid repeated letters. However, we need to check if S can appear twice. The rules say ""secret word"" but don't specify uniqueness. Let's assume it can.

But let's stick with ""SILVR"" as it's a valid word and uses common letters.

Wait, let's verify ""SILVR"":
- S in position 1 (correct, from feedback)
- I in position 2 (allowed)
- L in position 3 (new letter)
- V in position 4 (new letter)
- R in position 5 (allowed)

This seems valid.

Another option: ""SINKS"" – but K hasn't been tested and we don't know if it's allowed. Also, S is already in position 1, but duplicates are possible.

Between ""SILVR"" and ""SINKS"", ""SILVR"" seems better as it tests new letters L and V.

Thus, I'll guess ""SILVR"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 of these common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants well. This will give us good feedback on multiple fronts.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A (x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R (-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O (x) → O is NOT in the word.
- S (-) → S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E (x) → E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains R and S.
- Does NOT contain A, O, or E.
- R is not in position 2, S is not in position 4.

To maximize information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Uses R and S in new positions.
2. Adds new common consonants and vowels (I, U, T, L, N, etc.).
3. Avoids A, O, E.

A good candidate is “TRUST”:
- T, U, S, T: introduces T, U, S (S moves from position 4 to 3).
- R moves from position 2 to 4 (which is allowed since R is not in position 2).
- No A, O, E.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, U  
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still uncertain: R, S  
   - R is not in position 2 (from arose) and not in position 2 again (from trust) – so R ≠ 2.  
   - S is not in position 4 (from arose) and not in position 4 again (from trust) – so S ≠ 4.

We still need to place R and S somewhere else, and we have not yet tested the remaining common letters: I, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Include R and S in new positions (R not 2, S not 4).  
- Use fresh, common letters.  
- Avoid the eliminated set {A, O, E, T, U}.

Let’s try “CRISP”:
- C, I, S, P, P  
  – Places S in position 3 (allowed).  
  – Places R nowhere, but that’s fine because we can still test other positions for R.  
  – Uses new letters C, I, P.

Actually, we need to include R since we know it’s in the word.  
Let’s instead try “PRISM”:
- P, R, I, S, M  
  – R is in position 2 (but we know R is NOT in position 2) → conflict.  
  So PRISM is invalid.

Next try “DRIPS”:
- D, R, I, P, S  
  – R is in position 2 (again invalid).  

Try “CRISP” again but that omits R. We must include R.

Try “RISPS”:
- R, I, S, P, S  
  – R is in position 1 (allowed).  
  – S is in positions 3 and 5 (both allowed).  
  – Uses I, P.  

This seems valid.

But let’s pick a word that spreads R and S across more positions to maximize info.

Wait, let’s list valid positions:
- R can be 1, 3, 4, 5 (not 2).

Let’s pick a word that places R and S in two different positions.  
How about “SPRIG”:

Let's update what we know from all four guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (x in any position):
A, O, E, T, U, P, G, L, V

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or - in some position):
- S is fixed in position 1 (✓ from sprig and silvr)
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from arose, trust, sprig, silvr)  
  → This is impossible; R must appear at least once, but all five positions are excluded.  
  Therefore, our interpretation must be correct that R is in the word but none of the positions 2-5 have been ruled out entirely. Let's re-examine the feedback carefully.

From arose: R(-) → R is in word, not in position 2  
From trust: R(-) → R is in word, not in position 2 (redundant)  
From sprig: R(-) → R is in word, not in position 3  
From silvr: R(-) → R is in word, not in position 5  

So R is in word, positions ruled out: 2, 3, 5  
Allowed positions for R: 1, 4  
But position 1 is already S(✓), so R must be in position 4.

Letters that ARE in the word:
- S in position 1
- R in position 4
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, 5 (from sprig and silvr)  
  → I must be in position 3

So the pattern is now:
1: S
2: ?
3: I
4: R
5: ?

Letters still allowed (not yet eliminated): B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, N, Q, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 5. Common remaining letters: C, D, K, N, M, etc.

Possible words fitting S _ I R _:

- SHIR? – SHIRK? yes
- SWIR? – SWIRL? yes (but L is out)
- SPIN? – P is out
- SCAR? – A is out
- SICK? – C and K are allowed, but S I C K ? doesn't fit

Looking at SMIRK:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 of these common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants well. This will give us good feedback on multiple fronts.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A (x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R (-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O (x) → O is NOT in the word.
- S (-) → S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E (x) → E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains R and S.
- Does NOT contain A, O, or E.
- R is not in position 2, S is not in position 4.

To maximize information, I’ll pick a word that:
1. Uses R and S in new positions.
2. Adds new common consonants and vowels (I, U, T, L, N, etc.).
3. Avoids A, O, E.

A good candidate is “TRUST”:
- T, U, S, T: introduces T, U, S (S moves from position 4 to 3).
- R moves from position 2 to 4 (which is allowed since R is not in position 2).
- No A, O, E.

Let’s try it.

Guess 2: trust -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) U(x) S(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, U  
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still uncertain: R, S  
   - R is not in position 2 (from arose) and not in position 2 again (from trust) – so R ≠ 2.  
   - S is not in position 4 (from arose) and not in position 4 again (from trust) – so S ≠ 4.

We still need to place R and S somewhere else, and we have not yet tested the remaining common letters: I, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Include R and S in new positions (R not 2, S not 4).  
- Use fresh, common letters.  
- Avoid the eliminated set {A, O, E, T, U}.

Let’s try “CRISP”:
- C, I, S, P, P  
  – Places S in position 3 (allowed).  
  – Places R nowhere, but that’s fine because we can still test other positions for R.  
  – Uses new letters C, I, P.

Actually, we need to include R since we know it’s in the word.  
Let’s instead try “PRISM”:
- P, R, I, S, M  
  – R is in position 2 (but we know R is NOT in position 2) → conflict.  
  So PRISM is invalid.

Next try “DRIPS”:
- D, R, I, P, S  
  – R is in position 2 (again invalid).  

Try “CRISP” again but that omits R. We must include R.

Try “RISPS”:
- R, I, S, P, S  
  – R is in position 1 (allowed).  
  – S is in positions 3 and 5 (both allowed).  
  – Uses I, P.  

This seems valid.

But let’s pick a word that spreads R and S across more positions to maximize info.  
Try “CRISP” again but with R: impossible, only 5 letters.

Wait, let’s list valid positions:
- R can be 1, 3, 4, 5 (not 2).  
- S can be 1, 2, 3, 5 (not 4).

Let’s pick a word that places R and S in two different positions.  
How about “SPRIG”:
- S, P, R, I, G  
  – S in 1 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed).  
  – Uses P, I, G.  

This looks good.

Another candidate: “GRIPS”:
- G, R, I, P, S  
  – R in 2 (invalid).  

“CRISP” again omits R, so discard.

“DRIPS” has R in 2 (invalid).  

“PRISM” has R in 2 (invalid).  

“RIPSS” is invalid (double S).  

“SPIRE” is invalid (E already out).  

“SPIRS” is invalid (double S).  

“SPRIG” seems the best among the valid options.

Therefore, I’ll guess SPRIG.

Guess 3: sprig -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) R(-) I(-) G(x)
<|im_end|>

From the new feedback on SPRIG:

- S(✓) – S is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- P(x) – P is NOT in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- I(-) – I is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- G(x) – G is NOT in the word.

Summary of what we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, E, T, U, P, G  
Letters that ARE in the word and whose positions are fixed or partially constrained:
- S is fixed in position 1.
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from arose and trust) and NOT in position 3 (from sprig) → R must be in position 4 or 5.
- I is in the word but NOT in position 4 → I must be in position 2, 3, or 5.

We still need to test the remaining common letters: N, L, C, D, M, F, H, etc.

We have the pattern:
1: S
2: ?
3: ?
4: ?
5: ?

Constraints:
- R must be in position 4 or 5.
- I must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (but must not conflict with R).

Let’s try placing R in position 4 and I in position 2:
S I _ R _

We need two more letters from the remaining unused pool (avoiding A, O, E, T, U, P, G). Common choices: N, L, C, D, M, etc.

Let’s pick a word that fits S I _ R _ and uses common letters. One possibility is ""SIRRA"" but that repeats R which we already know is in the word. Another is ""SIRKS"" but K hasn't been tested yet. However, we need to avoid letters already ruled out.

A better choice is ""SILKY"" but Y hasn't been tested and we don't know if it's allowed. Let's stick with common letters.

Let's try ""SIRKS"":
- S I R K S
- R is in position 3 which conflicts with our constraint that R is NOT in position 3. So invalid.

Next, try ""SILKS"":
- S I L K S
- R isn't in this word, but we know R must be in the word. So invalid.

We need R in position 4 or 5. Let's try R in position 5:
S _ _ _ R

I must be in position 2, 3, or 5. Position 5 is R, so I must be in 2 or 3.

Option 1: I in position 2:
S I _ _ R

We need two more letters from the remaining pool. Let's try common letters: N, L, C, D, M, etc.

Possible word: ""SINCR"" – but that's not a valid English word.
""SILVR"" – V hasn't been tested but R is in position 5, which is allowed.
""SILVR"" is valid.

Option 2: I in position 3:
S _ I _ R

Possible word: ""SKINT"" – but T is already out.
""SKUNK"" – U is out.
""SKINS"" – S is already in position 1, but we can have S twice? The rules don't forbid repeated letters. However, we need to check if S can appear twice. The rules say ""secret word"" but don't specify uniqueness. Let's assume it can.

But let's stick with ""SILVR"" as it's a valid word and uses common letters.

Wait, let's verify ""SILVR"":
- S in position 1 (correct, from feedback)
- I in position 2 (allowed)
- L in position 3 (new letter)
- V in position 4 (new letter)
- R in position 5 (allowed)

This seems valid.

Another option: ""SINKS"" – but K hasn't been tested and we don't know if it's allowed. Also, S is already in position 1, but duplicates are possible.

Between ""SILVR"" and ""SINKS"", ""SILVR"" seems better as it tests new letters L and V.

Thus, I'll guess ""SILVR"".

Let's update what we know from all four guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (x in any position):
A, O, E, T, U, P, G, L, V

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or - in some position):
- S is fixed in position 1 (✓ from sprig and silvr)
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from arose, trust, sprig, silvr)  
  → This is impossible; R must appear at least once, but all five positions are excluded.  
  Therefore, our interpretation must be correct that R is in the word but none of the positions 2-5 have been ruled out entirely. Let's re-examine the feedback carefully.

From arose: R(-) → R is in word, not in position 2  
From trust: R(-) → R is in word, not in position 2 (redundant)  
From sprig: R(-) → R is in word, not in position 3  
From silvr: R(-) → R is in word, not in position 5  

So R is in word, positions ruled out: 2, 3, 5  
Allowed positions for R: 1, 4  
But position 1 is already S(✓), so R must be in position 4.

Letters that ARE in the word:
- S in position 1
- R in position 4
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, 5 (from sprig and silvr)  
  → I must be in position 3

So the pattern is now:
1: S
2: ?
3: I
4: R
5: ?

Letters still allowed (not yet eliminated): B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, N, Q, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 5. Common remaining letters: C, D, K, N, M, etc.

Possible words fitting S _ I R _:

- SWIR? – SWIRL? yes (but L is out)

- SICK? – C and K are allowed, but S I C K ? doesn't fit

Looking at SMIRK:

From the feedback on SMIRK:

- S(✓) – S is correct in position 1.  
- M(x) – M is NOT in the word.  
- I(✓) – I is correct in position 3.  
- R(✓) – R is correct in position 4.  
- K(✓) – K is correct in position 5.  

So the secret word is now fully determined:  
Position 1: S  
Position 2: ?  
Position 3: I  
Position 4: R  
Position 5: K  

The only missing letter is position 2.  
Letters already ruled out (x in any position):  
A, O, E, T, U, P, G, L, V, M  

Remaining possible letters for position 2: B, C, D, F, H, J, N, Q, W, X, Y, Z  

Looking for valid 5-letter English words that fit S _ I R K:

- SCRIRK – invalid  
- SDIRK – invalid  
- SFIRK – invalid  
- SHIRK – valid word  

Hence the only possible word is SHIRK.
