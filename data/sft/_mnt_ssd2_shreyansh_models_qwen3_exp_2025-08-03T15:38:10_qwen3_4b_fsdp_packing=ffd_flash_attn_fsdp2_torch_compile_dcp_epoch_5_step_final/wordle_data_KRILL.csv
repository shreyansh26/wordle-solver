For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""SLATE"" - it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word at all  
- L: - → in the word but not in position 2  
- A: x → not in the word  
- T: x → not in the word  
- E: x → not in the word  

So we know:
- The word contains the letter L, but L is not in position 2.
- The letters S, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

A good next guess should:
1. Reuse the confirmed letter L in a new position.
2. Avoid S, A, T, E entirely.
3. Introduce other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Candidate letters left (excluding S, A, T, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A balanced word using L plus other common letters is “CLIMB”:
- C (common consonant)
- L (known to be in the word, now in position 2)
- I (common vowel)
- M (common consonant)
- B (common consonant)

But “CLIMB” has L in position 2, which was already ruled out by the previous feedback (L was “-” meaning it’s in the word but not in position 2). So L cannot be in position 2 again.

Let’s try “FLING”:
- F (common consonant)
- L (known to be in the word, now in position 2) → again position 2 is invalid.

Next, “GLINT”:
- G (common consonant)
- L (known to be in the word, now in position 2) → again position 2 invalid.

Let’s move L to position 3: “BLIND”:
- B (common consonant)
- L (now in position 2) → still position 2 invalid.

“CLINK”:
- C (common consonant)
- L (position 2) → invalid.

“FLUNK”:
- F (common consonant)
- L (position 2) → invalid.

“PLUMB”:
- P (common consonant)
- L (position 2) → invalid.

“CLUB” is 4 letters, so invalid.

“GLUB” is 4 letters.

“BLUR” is 4 letters.

“CLIMB” already tried.

Let’s try “CRONY”:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- Y (sometimes vowel)

But we haven’t confirmed R, O, N, Y yet, and we know L must be in the word (but not in position 2). “CRONY” has no L.

We need a word with L not in position 2. Let’s try “ROUND”:
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- U (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- D (common consonant)

But again, no L.

Let’s list possible positions for L:
- Position 1: L _ _ _ _
- Position 3: _ _ L _ _
- Position 4: _ _ _ L _
- Position 5: _ _ _ _ L

We know L is in the word, just not in position 2.

Let’s try “LUMPY”:
- L (position 1)
- U (common vowel)
- M (common consonant)
- P (common consonant)
- Y (sometimes vowel)

This has L in position 1, which is allowed.

Another option is “LURCH”:
- L (position 1)
- U (common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- C (common consonant)
- H (common consonant)

But we don’t know if R, C, H are in the word yet.

“LUMPY” seems safer as it introduces U, M, P, Y while keeping L in position 1.

But let’s check if any of these letters were ruled out:
- S, A, T, E are out.
- L is confirmed.

So “LUMPY” is valid.

Alternatively, “LUNGI”:
- L (position 1)
- U (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- G (common consonant)
- I (common vowel)

But “LUNGI” is a valid word.

Between “LUMPY” and “LUNGI”, both are good, but “LUNGI” has I which is a vowel we haven’t tested yet.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""SLATE"" - it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word at all  
- L: - → in the word but not in position 2  
- A: x → not in the word  
- T: x → not in the word  
- E: x → not in the word  

So we know:
- The word contains the letter L, but L is not in position 2.
- The letters S, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

A good next guess should:
1. Reuse the confirmed letter L in a new position.
2. Avoid S, A, T, E entirely.
3. Introduce other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Candidate letters left (excluding S, A, T, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A balanced word using L plus other common letters is “CLIMB”:
- C (common consonant)
- L (known to be in the word, now in position 2)
- I (common vowel)
- M (common consonant)
- B (common consonant)

But “CLIMB” has L in position 2, which was already ruled out by the previous feedback (L was “-” meaning it’s in the word but not in position 2). So L cannot be in position 2 again.

Let’s try “FLING”:
- F (common consonant)
- L (known to be in the word, now in position 2) → again position 2 is invalid.

Next, “GLINT”:
- G (common consonant)
- L (known to be in the word, now in position 2) → again position 2 invalid.

Let’s move L to position 3: “BLIND”:
- B (common consonant)
- L (now in position 2) → still position 2 invalid.

“CLINK”:
- C (common consonant)
- L (position 2) → invalid.

“FLUNK”:
- F (common consonant)
- L (position 2) → invalid.

“PLUMB”:
- P (common consonant)
- L (position 2) → invalid.

“CLUB” is 4 letters, so invalid.

“GLUB” is 4 letters.

“BLUR” is 4 letters.

“CLIMB” already tried.

Let’s try “CRONY”:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- Y (sometimes vowel)

But we haven’t confirmed R, O, N, Y yet, and we know L must be in the word (but not in position 2). “CRONY” has no L.

We need a word with L not in position 2. Let’s try “ROUND”:
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- U (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- D (common consonant)

But again, no L.

Let’s list possible positions for L:
- Position 1: L _ _ _ _
- Position 3: _ _ L _ _
- Position 4: _ _ _ L _
- Position 5: _ _ _ _ L

We know L is in the word, just not in position 2.

Let’s try “LUMPY”:
- L (position 1)
- U (common vowel)
- M (common consonant)
- P (common consonant)
- Y (sometimes vowel)

This has L in position 1, which is allowed.

Another option is “LURCH”:
- L (position 1)
- U (common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- C (common consonant)
- H (common consonant)

But we don’t know if R, C, H are in the word yet.

“LUMPY” seems safer as it introduces U, M, P, Y while keeping L in position 1.

But let’s check if any of these letters were ruled out:
- S, A, T, E are out.
- L is confirmed.

So “LUMPY” is valid.

Alternatively, “LUNGI”:
- L (position 1)
- U (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- G (common consonant)
- I (common vowel)

But “LUNGI” is a valid word.

Between “LUMPY” and “LUNGI”, both are good, but “LUNGI” has I which is a vowel we haven’t tested yet.

Let’s go with “LUNGI”:
- L in position 1 (new position)
- U, N, G, I all new letters

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""SLATE"" - it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word at all  
- L: - → in the word but not in position 2  
- A: x → not in the word  
- T: x → not in the word  
- E: x → not in the word  

So we know:
- The word contains the letter L, but L is not in position 2.
- The letters S, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

A good next guess should:
1. Reuse the confirmed letter L in a new position.
2. Avoid S, A, T, E entirely.
3. Introduce other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Candidate letters left (excluding S, A, T, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A balanced word using L plus other common letters is “CLIMB”:
- C (common consonant)
- L (known to be in the word, now in position 2)
- I (common vowel)
- M (common consonant)
- B (common consonant)

But “CLIMB” has L in position 2, which was already ruled out by the previous feedback (L was “-” meaning it’s in the word but not in position 2). So L cannot be in position 2 again.

Let’s try “FLING”:
- F (common consonant)
- L (known to be in the word, now in position 2) → again position 2 is invalid.

Next, “GLINT”:
- G (common consonant)
- L (known to be in the word, now in position 2) → again position 2 invalid.

Let’s move L to position 3: “BLIND”:
- B (common consonant)
- L (now in position 2) → still position 2 invalid.

“CLINK”:
- C (common consonant)
- L (position 2) → invalid.

“FLUNK”:
- F (common consonant)
- L (position 2) → invalid.

“PLUMB”:
- P (common consonant)
- L (position 2) → invalid.

“CLUB” is 4 letters, so invalid.

“GLUB” is 4 letters.

“BLUR” is 4 letters.

“CLIMB” already tried.

Let’s try “CRONY”:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- Y (sometimes vowel)

But we haven’t confirmed R, O, N, Y yet, and we know L must be in the word (but not in position 2). “CRONY” has no L.

We need a word with L not in position 2. Let’s try “ROUND”:
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- U (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- D (common consonant)

But again, no L.

Let’s list possible positions for L:
- Position 1: L _ _ _ _
- Position 3: _ _ L _ _
- Position 4: _ _ _ L _
- Position 5: _ _ _ _ L

We know L is in the word, just not in position 2.

Let’s try “LUMPY”:
- L (position 1)
- U (common vowel)
- M (common consonant)
- P (common consonant)
- Y (sometimes vowel)

This has L in position 1, which is allowed.

Another option is “LURCH”:
- L (position 1)
- U (common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- C (common consonant)
- H (common consonant)

But we don’t know if R, C, H are in the word yet.

“LUMPY” seems safer as it introduces U, M, P, Y while keeping L in position 1.

But let’s check if any of these letters were ruled out:
- S, A, T, E are out.
- L is confirmed.

So “LUMPY” is valid.

Alternatively, “LUNGI”:
- L (position 1)
- U (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- G (common consonant)
- I (common vowel)

But “LUNGI” is a valid word.

Between “LUMPY” and “LUNGI”, both are good, but “LUNGI” has I which is a vowel we haven’t tested yet.

Let’s go with “LUNGI”:
- L in position 1 (new position)
- U, N, G, I all new letters

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: LUNGI -> FEEDBACK: L(-) U(x) N(x) G(x) I(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
- Letters ruled out: S, A, T, E  
- Letter L is in the word but NOT in position 1.

Round 2: LUNGI → L(-) U(x) N(x) G(x) I(-)  
- Letters ruled out: U, N, G  
- Letter L is still in the word but NOT in position 1 (confirmed again).  
- Letter I is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we know:
- The word contains L and I.  
- L cannot be in position 1 or 2 (because in SLATE it was position 1 and got “-”, and in LUNGI it was position 1 again and still “-”).  
- I cannot be in position 5.

Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the confirmed L and I.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses L and I.  
- L must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
- I must be in position 1-4.  
- Uses only untested letters elsewhere.

Let’s try placing L in position 3 and I in position 2: I _ L _ _

Candidate letters left: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A common word fitting I _ L _ _ is “ILLY” but that’s 4 letters.  
“ILKED” – no.  
“ILLOW” – 5 letters, but O is allowed and W is allowed.

“ILLOW”:
- I (position 1) – allowed.  
- L (position 3) – allowed.  
- L (position 4) – allowed.  
- O (position 5) – allowed.  
- W (position 2) – allowed.  
- Uses only untested letters except L and I which are confirmed.

But “ILLOW” has two L’s, which might not be efficient.

Another option: I _ _ L _ with a new consonant and vowel.

“IRL” is 3 letters.  
“IRL” + “Y” → “IRLY” – but Y is sometimes allowed.

“IRL” + “D” → “IRLD” – not a word.

“IRL” + “Y” → “IRLY” is a valid word (slang, but accepted in word lists).

But let’s try a more common word: “CLIMB” – but we already tried that.

Wait, we need to use I and L.  
Let’s try “CLIMB” – no I.

“FLING” – no I.

“BLIMP” – no I.

“FLIPS” – no I.

“CLIPS” – no I.

“CLIMB” – no I.

“FLICK” – no I.

“FLIRT” – no I.

“FRILL” – two L’s, but has I.

“FRILL”:
- F (new)  
- R (new)  
- I (position 3) – allowed.  
- L (position 4) – allowed.  
- L (position 5) – allowed.  
- Uses F, R, I, L – all either confirmed or new.

This seems good.

Another candidate: “WRILL” – but W is less common.

“PRILL” – P is new.

“BRILL” – B is new.

“DRILL” – D is new.

All these are valid, but “FRILL” is common.

Let’s go with “FRILL”.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""SLATE"" - it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word at all  
- L: - → in the word but not in position 2  
- A: x → not in the word  
- T: x → not in the word  
- E: x → not in the word  

So we know:
- The word contains the letter L, but L is not in position 2.
- The letters S, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

A good next guess should:
1. Reuse the confirmed letter L in a new position.
2. Avoid S, A, T, E entirely.
3. Introduce other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Candidate letters left (excluding S, A, T, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A balanced word using L plus other common letters is “CLIMB”:
- C (common consonant)
- L (known to be in the word, now in position 2)
- I (common vowel)
- M (common consonant)
- B (common consonant)

But “CLIMB” has L in position 2, which was already ruled out by the previous feedback (L was “-” meaning it’s in the word but not in position 2). So L cannot be in position 2 again.

Let’s try “FLING”:
- F (common consonant)
- L (known to be in the word, now in position 2) → again position 2 is invalid.

Next, “GLINT”:
- G (common consonant)
- L (known to be in the word, now in position 2) → again position 2 invalid.

Let’s move L to position 3: “BLIND”:
- B (common consonant)
- L (now in position 2) → still position 2 invalid.

“CLINK”:
- C (common consonant)
- L (position 2) → invalid.

“FLUNK”:
- F (common consonant)
- L (position 2) → invalid.

“PLUMB”:
- P (common consonant)
- L (position 2) → invalid.

“CLUB” is 4 letters, so invalid.

“GLUB” is 4 letters.

“BLUR” is 4 letters.

“CLIMB” already tried.

Let’s try “CRONY”:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- Y (sometimes vowel)

But we haven’t confirmed R, O, N, Y yet, and we know L must be in the word (but not in position 2). “CRONY” has no L.

We need a word with L not in position 2. Let’s try “ROUND”:
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- U (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- D (common consonant)

But again, no L.

Let’s list possible positions for L:
- Position 1: L _ _ _ _
- Position 3: _ _ L _ _
- Position 4: _ _ _ L _
- Position 5: _ _ _ _ L

We know L is in the word, just not in position 2.

Let’s try “LUMPY”:
- L (position 1)
- U (common vowel)
- M (common consonant)
- P (common consonant)
- Y (sometimes vowel)

This has L in position 1, which is allowed.

Another option is “LURCH”:
- L (position 1)
- U (common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- C (common consonant)
- H (common consonant)

But we don’t know if R, C, H are in the word yet.

“LUMPY” seems safer as it introduces U, M, P, Y while keeping L in position 1.

But let’s check if any of these letters were ruled out:
- S, A, T, E are out.
- L is confirmed.

So “LUMPY” is valid.

Alternatively, “LUNGI”:
- L (position 1)
- U (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- G (common consonant)
- I (common vowel)

But “LUNGI” is a valid word.

Between “LUMPY” and “LUNGI”, both are good, but “LUNGI” has I which is a vowel we haven’t tested yet.

Let’s go with “LUNGI”:
- L in position 1 (new position)
- U, N, G, I all new letters

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
- Letters ruled out: S, A, T, E  
- Letter L is in the word but NOT in position 1.

Round 2: LUNGI → L(-) U(x) N(x) G(x) I(-)  
- Letters ruled out: U, N, G  
- Letter L is still in the word but NOT in position 1 (confirmed again).  
- Letter I is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we know:
- The word contains L and I.  
- L cannot be in position 1 or 2 (because in SLATE it was position 1 and got “-”, and in LUNGI it was position 1 again and still “-”).  
- I cannot be in position 5.

Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the confirmed L and I.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses L and I.  
- L must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
- I must be in position 1-4.  
- Uses only untested letters elsewhere.

Let’s try placing L in position 3 and I in position 2: I _ L _ _

Candidate letters left: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A common word fitting I _ L _ _ is “ILLY” but that’s 4 letters.  
“ILKED” – no.  
“ILLOW” – 5 letters, but O is allowed and W is allowed.

“ILLOW”:
- I (position 1) – allowed.  
- L (position 3) – allowed.  
- L (position 4) – allowed.  
- O (position 5) – allowed.  
- W (position 2) – allowed.  
- Uses only untested letters except L and I which are confirmed.

But “ILLOW” has two L’s, which might not be efficient.

Another option: I _ _ L _ with a new consonant and vowel.

“IRL” is 3 letters.  
“IRL” + “Y” → “IRLY” – but Y is sometimes allowed.

“IRL” + “D” → “IRLD” – not a word.

“IRL” + “Y” → “IRLY” is a valid word (slang, but accepted in word lists).

But let’s try a more common word: “CLIMB” – but we already tried that.

Wait, we need to use I and L.  
Let’s try “CLIMB” – no I.

“FLING” – no I.

“BLIMP” – no I.

“FLIPS” – no I.

“CLIPS” – no I.

“CLIMB” – no I.

“FLICK” – no I.

“FLIRT” – no I.

“FRILL” – two L’s, but has I.

“FRILL”:
- F (new)  
- R (new)  
- I (position 3) – allowed.  
- L (position 4) – allowed.  
- L (position 5) – allowed.  
- Uses F, R, I, L – all either confirmed or new.

This seems good.

Another candidate: “WRILL” – but W is less common.

“PRILL” – P is new.

“BRILL” – B is new.

“DRILL” – D is new.

All these are valid, but “FRILL” is common.

Let’s go with “FRILL”.

in position 1.\n\nBut let’s check if any of these letters were ruled out:\n- S, A, T, E are out.\n- L is confirmed.\n\nSo “LUMPY” is valid.\n\nAlternatively, “LUNGI”:\n- L (position 1)\n- U (common vowel)\n- N (common consonant)\n- G (common consonant)\n- I (common vowel)\n\nBut “LUNGI” is a valid word.\n\nBetween “LUMPY” and “LUNGI”, both are good, but “LUNGI” has I which is a vowel we haven’t

We now know the pattern is _ R I L L and the first letter is NOT any of S, A, T, E, U, N, G, F, D, B.

Remaining possible first letters: C, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The only common 5-letter English word that fits _ R I L L is CRILL (though it's archaic), but the dictionary also accepts PRILL (a variant spelling of ""prill"" meaning small grains or pebbles). However, PRILL is not in standard Scrabble dictionaries.

Looking at standard word lists, the only remaining valid word is CRILL.

Therefore, the secret word must be CRILL.
