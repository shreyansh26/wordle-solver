### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers as many vowels and consonants as possible to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently used consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
- DOES contain S, but not in the 4th position.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S somewhere other than position 4.
- Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A balanced word that uses S in a new position and introduces new common letters is “STUNS”:
- S is now in position 1 (valid since it can’t be in 4).
- T and N are common consonants.
- U is a new vowel.

This should give us more information about T, N, U, and confirm where S belongs.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Good vowels to try next: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A balanced word that uses S in a new position and introduces new common letters is “STUNS”:
- S is now in position 1 (valid since it can’t be in 4).
- T and N are common consonants.
- U is a new vowel.

This should give us more information about T, N, U, and confirm where S belongs.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – A, R, O, E are **not** in the word.  
   – S is in the word but **not** in position 4.

2. stuns → S(-) T(-) U(-) N(x) S(-)  
   – N is **not** in the word.  
   – S appears **twice** but is **not** in positions 1 or 5.  
   – T and U are in the word but in the **wrong** positions.

So the secret word:
- Contains **S twice** (positions 2 or 3).  
- Contains **T** and **U**.  
- Does **not** contain A, R, O, E, N.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S in position 2 or 3.  
- Has T somewhere (but not position 2).  
- Has U somewhere (but not position 3).  
- Uses only remaining letters (no A, R, O, E, N).

A good candidate is **STUSH**:
- S is in position 1 → invalid (S must be in 2 or 3).  
Try **USUAL** → has A (invalid).  
Try **TUSKS** → has K (not ruled out yet), S in 5 → invalid (S must be in 2 or 3).  
Try **SULKY** → has Y, S in 1 → invalid.  
Try **STUMP** → has P, M, U in 2, S in 1 → invalid.  
Try **SUTRA** → has A, R → invalid.  
Try **STUPE** → has P, E → invalid.  
Try **STUDY** → has D, Y, S in 1 → invalid.  
Try **STUFF** → has F, F, S in 1 → invalid.  
Try **SULKY** → already saw S in 1 is bad.  
Try **STUMP** → same.  
Try **STUPE** → same.  
Try **STUDY** → same.  
Try **STUFF** → same.  
Try **STUSH** → S in 1 → same issue.

Let’s list valid positions:
- S must be in 2 or 3.  
- T must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2).  
- U must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

Try S in 2:
Word pattern: _ S _ _ _
T can be 1, 3, 4, 5.  
U can be 1, 4, 5 (cannot be 3 because S is there).  

Try T in 1, U in 4: T S _ U _
Need a letter for position 3 (not S, T, U, and not A, R, O, E, N).  
Good consonants left: C, D, L, M, P, etc.  
Try T S C U _ → need a 5th letter.  
T S C U L → “TSCUL” – not a word.  
T S C U P → “TSCUP” – not a word.  
T S L U _ → T S L U _ → “TSLU_” – no.  
Try T in 1, U in 5: T S _ _ U  
Need letters 3,4.  
T S _ _ U → “T S _ _ U” – “T S C K U” – “TSCUK” – not a word.  
Try T in 3, U in 1: U _ T S _  
Need letters 2 and 5.  
U _ T S _ → “U B T S A” – invalid.  
Try T in 3, U in 4: _ S T _ U  
Need letters 1 and 4.  
Try D S T _ U → “D S T _ U” – “D S T I U” – “DSTIU” – not a word.  
Try C S T _ U → “C S T _ U” – “C S T I U” – not a word.  
Try M S T _ U → not a word.  
Try S in 3:
Word pattern: _ _ S _ _
T must be 1, 2, 4, or 5 (not 3).  
U must be 1, 2, 4, or 5 (not 3).  

Try T in 1, U in 2: T U S _ _  
Need letters 4,5.  
T U S _ _ → “T U S K Y” – “TUSKY” – valid word.  
Check constraints:
- S is in 3 → valid (must be 2 or 3).  
- T is in 1 → valid (not 2).  
- U is in 2 → valid (not 3).

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. stuns → S(-) T(-) U(-) N(x) S(-)  
   – N is not in the word.

   – T and U are in the word but in the wrong positions.

3. tusky → T(-) U(✓) S(✓) K(x) Y(✓)  
   – U is in the correct position (position 2).  
   – S is in the correct position (position 3).  
   – T is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – K and Y are not in the word.

So the secret word has the pattern:

- Position 1: unknown, but not T, A, R, O, E, N, K  
- Position 2: U (confirmed)  
- Position 3: S (confirmed)  
- Position 4: unknown, but not S, T, K, A, R, O, E, N  
- Position 5: Y (confirmed)  

And it must also contain T somewhere (positions 2,3,4,5) but T is already known to be in the word and we have:

- T cannot be in position 1 (from tusky feedback)  
- T cannot be in position 2 (because U is confirmed there)  
- T cannot be in position 3 (because S is confirmed there)  
- T cannot be in position 5 (because Y is confirmed there)  
- Therefore T must be in position 4.

So the pattern is now:

1 _  U  S  T  ?

Wait, the pattern is 5 letters: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

We have:

- Position 2: U  
- Position 3: S  
- Position 4: T (only remaining spot for T)  
- Position 5: Y  

So the word must be: _ U S T Y

Now we just need to find the correct first letter.  
Available letters (not ruled out): any consonant except A, R, O, E, N, K, and no repeats of S, T, U, Y.

Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, etc.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers as many vowels and consonants as possible to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently used consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
- DOES contain S, but not in the 4th position.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S somewhere other than position 4.
- Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A balanced word that uses S in a new position and introduces new common letters is “STUNS”:
- S is now in position 1 (valid since it can’t be in 4).
- T and N are common consonants.
- U is a new vowel.

This should give us more information about T, N, U, and confirm where S belongs.

Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: stuns -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) U(-) N(x) S(-)
Guess 3: tusky -> FEEDBACK: T(-) U(✓) S(✓) K(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – A, R, O, E are not in the word.  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. stuns → S(-) T(-) U(-) N(x) S(-)  
   – N is not in the word.  
   – S appears twice but is not in positions 1 or 5.  
   – T and U are in the word but in the wrong positions.

3. tusky → T(-) U(✓) S(✓) K(x) Y(✓)  
   – U is in the correct position (position 2).  
   – S is in the correct position (position 3).  
   – T is in the word but not in position 1.  
   – K and Y are not in the word.

So the secret word has the pattern:

- Position 1: unknown, but not T, A, R, O, E, N, K  
- Position 2: U (confirmed)  
- Position 3: S (confirmed)  
- Position 4: unknown, but not S, T, K, A, R, O, E, N  
- Position 5: Y (confirmed)  

And it must also contain T somewhere (positions 2,3,4,5) but T is already known to be in the word and we have:

- T cannot be in position 1 (from tusky feedback)  
- T cannot be in position 2 (because U is confirmed there)  
- T cannot be in position 3 (because S is confirmed there)  
- T cannot be in position 5 (because Y is confirmed there)  
- Therefore T must be in position 4.

So the pattern is now:

1 _  U  S  T  ?

Wait, the pattern is 5 letters: positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

We have:

- Position 2: U  
- Position 3: S  
- Position 4: T (only remaining spot for T)  
- Position 5: Y  

So the word must be: _ U S T Y

Now we just need to find the correct first letter.  
Available letters (not ruled out): any consonant except A, R, O, E, N, K, and no repeats of S, T, U, Y.

Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words ending in ""USTY"":

- BUSTY  
- CUSTY (not a common word)  
- DUSTY  
- FUSTY (not a word)  
- GUSTY  
- HUSTY  
- LUSTY  
- MUSTY  
- PUSTY (not a word)  
- VUSTY (not a word)  

""BUSTY"" and ""DUSTY"" are both valid.  
Between these, ""BUSTY"" is more common.

Let's check ""BUSTY"":

- B: not ruled out  
- U: confirmed position 2  
- S: confirmed position 3  
- T: confirmed position 4  
- Y: confirmed position 5  

This fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers as many vowels and consonants as possible to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequently used consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
- DOES contain S, but not in the 4th position.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S somewhere other than position 4.
- Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

A balanced word that uses S in a new position and introduces new common letters is “STUNS”:
- S is now in position 1 (valid since it can’t be in 4).
- T and N are common consonants.
- U is a new vowel.

This should give us more information about T, N, U, and confirm where S belongs.

So the secret word:

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – A, R, O, E are not in the word.  
   – S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. stuns → S(-) T(-) U(-) N(x) S(-)  
   – N is not in the word.  
   – S appears twice but is not in positions 1 or 5.

   – S is in the correct position (position 3).  
   – T is in the word but not in position 1.

So the secret word has the pattern:

- Position 3: S (confirmed)  
- Position 4: unknown, but not S, T, K, A, R, O, E, N

And it must also contain T somewhere (positions 2,3,4,5) but T is already known to be in the word and we have:

- T cannot be in position 2 (because U is confirmed there)  
- T cannot be in position 3 (because S is confirmed there)  
- T cannot be in position 5 (because Y is confirmed there)  
- Therefore T must be in position 4.

So the pattern is now:

- Position 4: T (only remaining spot for T)  
- Position 5: Y  

So the word must be: _ U S T Y

Now we just need to find the correct first letter.  
Available letters (not ruled out): any consonant except A, R, O, E, N, K, and no repeats of S, T, U, Y.

Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words ending in ""USTY"":

- BUSTY  
- CUSTY (not a common word)  
- DUSTY  
- FUSTY (not a word)  
- GUSTY  
- HUSTY  
- LUSTY  
- MUSTY  
- PUSTY (not a word)  
- VUSTY (not a word)  

""BUSTY"" and ""DUSTY"" are both valid.  
Between these, ""BUSTY"" is more common.

Let's check ""BUSTY"":

- B: not ruled out  
- U: confirmed position 2  
- S: confirmed position 3  
- T: confirmed position 4  
- Y: confirmed position 5  

This fits all constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: stuns -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) U(-) N(x) S(-)
Guess 3: tusky -> FEEDBACK: T(-) U(✓) S(✓) K(x) Y(✓)
Guess 4: busty -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) S(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>

From the feedback on “busty” we now know:

- B is NOT in the word (x).  
- U is in position 2 (✓).  
- S is in position 3 (✓).  
- T is in position 4 (✓).  
- Y is in position 5 (✓).

Therefore the secret word must be _ U S T Y, with the first letter being any consonant that has not yet been ruled out (A, R, O, E, N, K, B are all excluded).

Common first letters that fit and make a valid 5-letter word are:

- C → CUSTY (not a standard word)  
- D → DUSTY (valid)  
- F → FUSTY (invalid)  
- G → GUSTY (valid)  
- H → HUSTY (valid)  
- L → LUSTY (valid)  
- M → MUSTY (valid)  
- P → PUSTY (invalid)  
- V → VUSTY (invalid)  
- W → WUSTY (invalid)

The most common and likely word is **DUSTY**.
