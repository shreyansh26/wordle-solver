### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. Common starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""ADIEU,"" or ""RAISE."" 

After considering these options, ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because:
- It includes two common vowels (A, E)
- It has three very common consonants (S, L, T)
- These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words
- It has a good mix of different letters that could help identify or eliminate many possibilities

This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down the secret word.

From the feedback:
- S, L, A are all in the word and in the correct positions (1st, 2nd, 3rd letters).
- T and E are NOT in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: S L A _ _

We need two more letters that are NOT T or E. Common consonants that haven’t been ruled out include R, N, D, C, H, etc., and vowels we haven’t used yet are I, O, U.

A good next guess should test new common letters while keeping the known S-L-A sequence. The word ""SLAIN"" comes to mind (means ""killed"" in archaic English, but it's a valid 5-letter word). It uses:
- Known letters S, L, A in positions 1-3
- New letters I and N, neither of which is T or E
- This will help determine if I or N (or another consonant) fits the remaining slots.

Another option could be ""SLANG"" (but G is less common than N). ""SLAIN"" seems slightly better for testing a common vowel and consonant.
