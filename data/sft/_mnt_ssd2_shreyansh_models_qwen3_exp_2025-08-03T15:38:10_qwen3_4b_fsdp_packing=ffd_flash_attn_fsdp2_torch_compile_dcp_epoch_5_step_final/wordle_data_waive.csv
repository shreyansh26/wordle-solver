For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc. 

""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps test for vowels in the secret word
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which are also very frequent in English words
- No repeated letters, maximizing the information gained

This should give us good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains A, but not in position 1.
3. It does NOT contain R, O, or S.

- Uses other common consonants to maximize information

A good candidate is ""PAINT"":
- Ends with T, but we know E is at the end, so this is bad. Let me rethink.

Better: ""PLATE"":
- Ends with E (correct)
- Contains A in position 3 (valid since A can't be in position 1)
- Uses P, L, T which are common consonants
- Avoids R, O, S

This seems like a good second guess.

Let's try a word that:

- Uses new letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is ""GNAWE"" but W isn't super common.

But let me think of a word with A in position 4: ""DAMNE"" is not valid.  
""VAMPE"" is not common.  
""YAMBE"" is obscure.  
""GAFFE"" has F which is excluded.  
""MAIZE"" has I and Z which aren't tested yet but we want A in position 4.

Actually, let's try ""MAIZE"":
- Ends with E.
- A in position 2.

Let me reconsider: position 2 seems more promising with common letters.  
Let's try ""BANKE"" (a variant spelling of ""bank"" plus E) but it's obscure.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc. 

""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps test for vowels in the secret word
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which are also very frequent in English words
- No repeated letters, maximizing the information gained

This should give us good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains A, but not in position 1.
3. It does NOT contain R, O, or S.

Next, I want a word that:
- Ends with E
- Uses A in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since it can't be in position 1)
- Avoids R, O, S
- Uses other common consonants to maximize information

A good candidate is ""PAINT"":
- Ends with T, but we know E is at the end, so this is bad. Let me rethink.

Better: ""PLATE"":
- Ends with E (correct)
- Contains A in position 3 (valid since A can't be in position 1)
- Uses P, L, T which are common consonants
- Avoids R, O, S

This seems like a good second guess.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S are not in the word.

   - E is still fixed in position 5.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (and we already knew it’s not in position 1).
   - P, L, T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains A in position 2 or 4 (since it can’t be 1 or 3).
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, P, L, T.

Remaining common consonants to test: N, D, G, B, C, H, M, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Puts A in position 2 (since position 4 is also possible, but we’ll test 2 first).
- Uses new consonants to maximize information.

A good candidate is “CABIN” but it ends with N, not E.  
Another candidate is “GNAWE”:
- Ends with E.
- A is in position 2.
- Uses G, N, W which are new letters.

But “GNAWE” might be less common. A more common word is “BANAL” but it ends with L (already excluded).  
Next, “HABIT” ends with T (excluded).  
“CHAFE”:
- Ends with E.
- A in position 2.
- Uses C, H, F which are new letters.

This seems like a strong third guess.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc. 

""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps test for vowels in the secret word
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which are also very frequent in English words
- No repeated letters, maximizing the information gained

This should give us good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains A, but not in position 1.
3. It does NOT contain R, O, or S.

Next, I want a word that:
- Ends with E
- Uses A in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since it can't be in position 1)
- Avoids R, O, S
- Uses other common consonants to maximize information

A good candidate is ""PAINT"":
- Ends with T, but we know E is at the end, so this is bad. Let me rethink.

Better: ""PLATE"":
- Ends with E (correct)
- Contains A in position 3 (valid since A can't be in position 1)
- Uses P, L, T which are common consonants
- Avoids R, O, S

This seems like a good second guess.

Guess 2: PLATE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S are not in the word.

2. PLATE → P(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
   - E is still fixed in position 5.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (and we already knew it’s not in position 1).
   - P, L, T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains A in position 2 or 4 (since it can’t be 1 or 3).
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, P, L, T.

Remaining common consonants to test: N, D, G, B, C, H, M, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Puts A in position 2 (since position 4 is also possible, but we’ll test 2 first).
- Uses new consonants to maximize information.

A good candidate is “CABIN” but it ends with N, not E.  
Another candidate is “GNAWE”:
- Ends with E.
- A is in position 2.
- Uses G, N, W which are new letters.

But “GNAWE” might be less common. A more common word is “BANAL” but it ends with L (already excluded).  
Next, “HABIT” ends with T (excluded).  
“CHAFE”:
- Ends with E.
- A in position 2.
- Uses C, H, F which are new letters.

This seems like a strong third guess.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed at position 5.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.

2. PLATE → P(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
   - A is not in position 3.
   - P, L, T are excluded.

3. CHAFE → C(x) H(x) A(-) F(x) E(✓)
   - A is not in position 3 (already known).
   - C, H, F are excluded.

So we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains A in position 2 or 4 (since it can't be 1, 3, or 5).
- Excluded letters so far: R, O, S, P, L, T, C, H, F.

Remaining common consonants: N, D, G, B, M, Y, K, V, W, etc.

Let's try a word that:
- Ends with E.
- Puts A in position 4 (since position 2 is also possible but we want to test 4 now).
- Uses new letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is ""GNAWE"" but W isn't super common.  
Another candidate is ""MADGE"":
- Ends with E.
- A in position 2.
- Uses M, D, G which are new letters.

But we want to test position 4.  
Let's try ""BANKE"":
- Ends with E.
- A in position 2.
- Uses B, N, K which are new letters.

Actually, let's try ""BANKE"" first since it's common and tests A in position 2.  
If that fails, we can move to position 4.

But let me think of a word with A in position 4: ""DAMNE"" is not valid.  
""VAMPE"" is not common.  
""YAMBE"" is obscure.  
""GAFFE"" has F which is excluded.  
""MAIZE"" has I and Z which aren't tested yet but we want A in position 4.

Actually, let's try ""MAIZE"":
- Ends with E.
- A in position 2.
- Uses M, I, Z.

But we need to test position 4.  
A valid word with A in position 4 is ""VAMPE"" but it's not common.  
""YAMBE"" is obscure.  
""GAFFE"" has F excluded.  
""DAFFE"" has F excluded.  

Let me reconsider: position 2 seems more promising with common letters.  
Let's try ""BANKE"" (a variant spelling of ""bank"" plus E) but it's obscure.  
Actually, ""BANKE"" is valid in some dictionaries.

But let's try ""MADGE"" which is more common:
- Ends with E.
- A in position 2.
- Uses M, D, G.

This seems like the best next guess.

From the latest feedback:

- Position 1: N(x) → N is not in the word.
- Position 2: A(✓) → A is correctly placed here.
- Position 3: I(✓) → I is correctly placed here.
- Position 4: V(✓) → V is correctly placed here.
- Position 5: E(✓) → E is correctly placed here.

So the word structure is: _ A I V E

We need a 5-letter word that starts with a consonant (since position 1 is not A, and we already have A, I, V, E in their correct positions) and ends with ""IVE"". The only common English word fitting this pattern is ""BAIVE"", but that's not a standard word. However, ""BAIVE"" is actually a valid variant spelling of ""BAIT"" plus ""E"", but it's obscure.

Looking at standard dictionaries, the only common word with the pattern _ A I V E is ""CAIVE"" (not valid) and ""DAIVE"" (not valid). But ""BAIVE"" is listed in some dictionaries as a variant of ""BAIT"". However, the more common word is ""BAIT"" which is 4 letters.

Wait, let's reconsider. The structure is _ A I V E. The only common English word with this exact pattern is ""CAIVE"" (not valid) and ""DAIVE"" (not valid). But ""BAIVE"" is listed in the Merriam-Webster as a variant spelling of ""BAIT"" plus ""E"", but it's obscure.

However, looking at the pattern _ A I V E, the only valid word is ""CAIVE"" which isn't valid. This suggests we might have made an error in tracking excluded letters.

Let me re-examine the excluded letters:

Excluded so far: R, O, S, P, L, T, C, H, F, M, D, G, N.

Remaining consonants: B, K, V, W, Y, etc.

Given the structure _ A I V E, the only possible starting consonant that forms a valid word is ""B"", making ""BAIVE"" the only candidate, but it's obscure. However, ""BAIVE"" is actually listed as a variant of ""BAIT"" plus ""E"".

But looking back at the feedback, we have:

- Position 1: N(x) - N is not in the word.
- Position 2: A(✓)
- Position 3: I(✓)
- Position 4: V(✓)
- Position 5: E(✓)

This means the word must be _ A I V E. The only valid English word with this pattern is ""CAIVE"" (invalid) and ""DAIVE"" (invalid). This suggests there might be an error in our tracking.

Wait, let's check ""BAIVE"" in the Scrabble dictionary: it is listed as a valid word (variant spelling of ""BAIT""). However, it's quite obscure.

But considering the feedback, we have:

- A at 2
- I at 3
- V at 4
- E at 5

So the word is _ A I V E. The only possible starting letter from remaining consonants is B, making ""BAIVE"" the only candidate.

But ""BAIVE"" is not common. Let me check if there's any other possibility. The structure _ A I V E with remaining consonants: B, K, W, Y.

""BAIVE"" is the only valid word here. However, since ""BAIVE"" is obscure, this suggests we might have missed something.

But looking back at the feedback, we have:

- Guess 5: NAIVE -> N(x) A(✓) I(✓) V(✓) E(✓)

This means the word is _ A I V E. The only valid English word with this pattern is ""CAIVE"" (invalid) and ""DAIVE"" (invalid). This suggests the word must be ""BAIVE"" despite its obscurity.

However, in standard Wordle lists, the word ""BAIVE"" is not present. This indicates we might have made an error in tracking.

Let me re-examine the feedback:

From Guess 4: MADGE → M(x) A(✓) D(x) G(x) E(✓)
This shows A is at 2, E at 5.

From Guess 5: NAIVE → N(x) A(✓) I(✓) V(✓) E(✓)
This shows the word is _ A I V E.

The only valid English word with this pattern is ""CAIVE"" (invalid) and ""DAIVE"" (invalid). This suggests the word must be ""BAIVE"", but it's not in standard dictionaries.

This indicates we might have missed a letter or there's an error. However, the structure is clear: _ A I V E.

Given remaining consonants, ""BAIVE"" is the only possibility, but since it's not standard, this suggests we need to check if any other letters were missed.

But looking back, all consonants except B, K, W, Y have been excluded. The structure _ A I V E with these letters gives:

- B: BAIVE (obscure)
- K: KAIVE (invalid)
- W: WAIVE (valid!)

Wait, ""WAIVE"" is a valid word: W A I V E.

This fits perfectly with the structure _ A I V E and uses W, which hasn't been excluded.

This seems like the correct word.

The feedback from Guess 5 shows the exact pattern _ A I V E. The only valid 5-letter English word fitting this pattern is ""WAIVE"".

<guess>WAIVE</guess>",WAIVE,"From the latest feedback:

- Position 1: N(x) → N is not in the word.
- Position 2: A(✓) → A is correctly placed here.
- Position 3: I(✓) → I is correctly placed here.
- Position 4: V(✓) → V is correctly placed here.
- Position 5: E(✓) → E is correctly placed here.

So the word structure is: _ A I V E

We need a 5-letter word that starts with a consonant (since position 1 is not A, and we already have A, I, V, E in their correct positions) and ends with ""IVE"". The only common English word fitting this pattern is ""BAIVE"", but that's not a standard word. However, ""BAIVE"" is actually a valid variant spelling of ""BAIT"" plus ""E"", but it's obscure.

Looking at standard dictionaries, the only common word with the pattern _ A I V E is ""CAIVE"" (not valid) and ""DAIVE"" (not valid). But ""BAIVE"" is listed in some dictionaries as a variant of ""BAIT"". However, the more common word is ""BAIT"" which is 4 letters.
