### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of these common letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives us maximum coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters in one guess, helping narrow down the possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(x) → A is not in the word.  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.  
- O(x) → O is not in the word.  
- S(x) → S is not in the word.  
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters NOT present: A, O, S  
- Letters present somewhere: R, E  
- R cannot be in position 2, E cannot be in position 5.

I want a new word that:
1. Uses R and E (since they’re confirmed in the word).  
2. Avoids A, O, S.  
3. Places R and E in new positions to test their correct spots.

A good candidate is “REBID”:
- Contains R and E.  
- Avoids A, O, S.  
- R is now in position 1 (testing a new spot).  
- E is now in position 2 (testing a new spot).  
- Adds two new consonants (B, D) to probe other common letters.

From the new feedback on “rebid”:

- R(✓) – R is in the word and in position 1.  
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 2.  
- B(✓) – B is in the word and in position 3.  
- I(x) – I is not in the word.  
- D(x) – D is not in the word.

So we now know the exact pattern:

R E B _ _

Letters still unknown: positions 4 and 5.

Letters already ruled out: A, O, S, I, D.

Letters we still have to test: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Among common 5-letter words that start with “reb”, the next possibilities are:

- rebus (but “us” might be too common or too similar to “arose”)  
- rebid (already guessed)  
- rebar (but “ar” was ruled out)  
- rebel (but “el” might be too similar to “arose” ending)  
- reben (not a valid word)  
- rebus (valid, but “us” is a common ending)

However, “rebus” is a valid word and fits the pattern. But let me think of a word that fits R E B _ _ and uses common letters. Another option is “rebel”, but “el” might be too similar to the previous “arose” ending. 

Wait, let me check: the pattern is R E B _ _. Common words that fit:

- rebel – but “el” is possible.  
- rebar – but “ar” is ruled out.  
- rebus – valid, uses “us”.  
- reben – not valid.  
- rebid – already done.  

The best next guess seems to be “rebel” because it tests “el” in positions 4-5, which hasn’t been tried yet. However, “el” is a common ending, and we have no information about L or T yet. 

But looking at the pattern, position 4 and 5 are unknown. Let me think of a word that fits R E B _ _ and uses common letters. “rebel” is a good candidate, but another possibility is “reben” (invalid). 

Actually, “rebel” is valid and fits. But let me think of another word that might give more information. 

Another valid word: “rebel” – but let me check if there are better options. 

Wait, “rebel” is R E B E L. This tests L in position 5 and E in position 4. But we already know E is in position 2, so this is acceptable. 

But let me think of a word that uses different letters. “rebel” seems the most straightforward. 

However, another valid word is “reben” (invalid). 

Actually, the valid words are limited. The best next guess is “rebel”. 

But let me think again: we have R E B _ _. The next common letters to test are L, T, N, etc. 

A better word might be “rebel” or “reben” (invalid). 

The valid word is “rebel”. 

But let me check if there’s a better word. 

Another valid word: “rebel” – yes, this seems to be the only valid word fitting R E B _ _ that hasn’t been guessed. 

Therefore, the next guess is “rebel”.
