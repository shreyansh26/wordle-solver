### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All distinct letters
- High frequency letters in English words

This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

- A(x) → A is not in the word.

- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).

- The word is of the form _ R O _ _

Next, I want a word that:
1. Keeps R in position 2 and O in position 3.
2. Introduces new common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out.
3. Avoids A, S, E.

Good candidates: “DROOL”, “CROON”, “GROIN”, “BROTH”, “CROWD”, etc.

“CROWD” looks good because it:
- Keeps R in slot 2 and O in slot 3.
- Introduces C, W, D (all new letters).
- Avoids A, S, E.

From the three rounds we have:

1. Pattern: _ R O _ _
2. Eliminated letters: A, S, E, C, D, B, N
3. W is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (because in both crowd and brown it was marked “-”).
4. N is in the word but NOT in position 5 (because in brown it was marked “-”).

So:
- Position 1: any letter not yet eliminated (cannot be A, S, E, C, D, B)
- Position 5: cannot be A, S, E, C, D, B, N, W
- W must be in position 3, but position 3 is already O (from arose feedback). That’s impossible, so W must be in position 2, but position 2 is R. Also impossible.

Wait, let’s re-examine the feedback carefully:

- arose: R(✓) O(✓) means R is in position 2, O in position 3.
- crowd: W(-) means W is in the word but not in position 4.
- brown: N(-) means N is in the word but not in position 5.

So the word is _ R O _ _, with:
- W somewhere (positions 1, 3, 5) but 3 is O, so W must be in 1 or 5.
- N somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, 4) but 2 is R, 3 is O, so N must be in 1 or 4.
- Eliminated letters: A, S, E, C, D, B.

Possible combinations:
- If W is in position 1: W R O _ _, then N must be in 4: W R O N _
- If N is in position 1: N R O _ _, then W must be in 5: N R O _ W

Check which of these make valid words:
- W R O N _: WRONG is a word.
- N R O _ W: NR... no common 5-letter word fits.

So the only possible word is WRONG.

Let’s verify:
- W is in position 1 (not ruled out)
- R in 2 (correct)
- O in 3 (correct)
- N in 4 (not ruled out)
- G is a new letter (not eliminated)

This satisfies all constraints.
