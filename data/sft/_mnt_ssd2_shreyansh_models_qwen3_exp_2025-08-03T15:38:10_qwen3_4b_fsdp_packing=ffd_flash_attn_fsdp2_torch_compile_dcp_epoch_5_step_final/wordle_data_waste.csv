2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 of these letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.

Some good starting words include:
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains 5 of the most common letters and has no repeated letters, giving maximum information. It's also a valid English word.

Possible positions:

- If A is in position 3: _ _ A T E → then S must be in position 2 → _ S A T E → “BASTE”, “DASTE” (invalid), “FASTE” (invalid), “GASTE” (invalid), “HASTE”, “LASTE” (invalid), “MASTE” (invalid), “PASTE”, “VASTE” (invalid), “WASTE”.

Valid words among these: BASTE (obsolete), HASTE, PASTE, WASTE (valid).

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends with TE (positions 4-5 are T and E).
2. It contains A and S somewhere, but:
   - A is not in position 1 or 3 (from arose and slate).
   - S is not in position 1 or 4 (from arose and slate).
3. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, L.

So far the pattern is: _ _ _ T E  
and the word must include A and S in positions 2 or 3 (since 1,3,4 are excluded for A and 1,4 for S).

Possible positions:
- A must be in position 2 or 3.
- S must be in position 2 or 3 (but not the same spot as A).

Let’s list candidates:
- If A is in position 2: _ A _ T E → then S must be in position 3 → _ A S T E → only “CASET” is invalid (not a word), “MASET” etc. don’t exist.
- If A is in position 3: _ _ A T E → then S must be in position 2 → _ S A T E → “BASTE”, “DASTE” (invalid), “FASTE” (invalid), “GASTE” (invalid), “HASTE”, “LASTE” (invalid), “MASTE” (invalid), “PASTE”, “VASTE” (invalid), “WASTE”.

Valid words among these: BASTE (obsolete), HASTE, PASTE, WASTE (valid).  
The most common and likely is “HASTE”.

Check constraints:
- H(1), A(3), S(2), T(4), E(5)
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since it wasn’t marked wrong there)
- S is in position 2 (allowed, since it wasn’t marked wrong there)
- No R, O, L
- Ends with TE

This fits perfectly.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 of these letters to quickly narrow down possibilities.

Some good starting words include:
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains 5 of the most common letters and has no repeated letters, giving maximum information. It's also a valid English word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(x) : R is NOT in the word.
- O(x) : O is NOT in the word.
- S(-) : S is in the word but in the wrong position (not 4th).
- E(✓) : E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains A and S somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.
- It does NOT contain R or O.

We need a 5-letter word that ends in E, has A and S, avoids R and O, and places A and S in new positions.

Possible positions for A: 2, 3, 4, 5 (but 5 is E, so 2,3,4)
Possible positions for S: 1,2,3,5 (but 5 is E, so 1,2,3)

Let's try to form words:
- SAINT: has A and S, ends in T (invalid)
- STALE: has A and S, ends in E, positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), L(4), E(5) - this fits all constraints
- SLATE: has A and S, ends in E, positions: S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) - also fits
- SALE: too short
- STAGE: has A and S, ends in E, positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), G(4), E(5) - fits

Between STALE and SLATE, both are valid. STALE has T and L, SLATE has L and T - both are common letters. Let's choose SLATE as it's a common word.

Wait, let me check: SLATE has S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) - fits all constraints.

- S(✓) → S is in the word and in position 3.
- T(✓) → T is in the word and in position 4.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

So the pattern is _ A S T E.

Letters already ruled out for position 1: R, O, L, H, P.

Remaining common first letters that would make a valid 5-letter word ending in “ASTE”:

- C → CASTE (valid)
- D → DASTE (invalid)
- F → FASTE (invalid)
- G → GASTE (invalid)
- M → MASTE (invalid)
- V → VASTE (invalid)
- W → WASTE (valid)

Between CASTE and WASTE, both are valid, but WASTE is more common. However, the word “WASTE” has W in position 1, which hasn’t been ruled out yet.

But wait—let’s double-check: the feedback never said anything about W, so it’s still possible.

However, looking back at the feedback from previous guesses, the word must be _ASTE, and the only remaining common word is “WASTE”.

But let me re-examine the list of ruled-out letters for position 1:

- Ruled out: R, O, L, H, P.

“WASTE” starts with W, which is not in that list, so it’s valid.

But I just realized—there’s also “CASTE”. Both are valid, but “WASTE” is more common.

However, the feedback never indicated that the word couldn’t be “CASTE”, so both are possible.

But since we have only one slot left and two possible words, we need to choose the more common one.

Between CASTE and WASTE, WASTE is more common, so I’ll go with that.

Wait—let me re-read the feedback carefully:

- Guess 1: arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
- Guess 2: slate → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(✓)
- Guess 3: haste → H(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓) E(✓)
- Guess 4: paste → P(x) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓) E(✓)

So the pattern is _ A S T E.

Letters ruled out for position 1: R, O, L, H, P.

Remaining possible first letters: C, D, F, G, M, V, W, Y, etc.

Valid 5-letter words ending in “ASTE”:

- CASTE
- DASTE (invalid)
- FASTE (invalid)
- GASTE (invalid)
- MASTE (invalid)
- VASTE (invalid)
- WASTE
- YASTE (invalid)

Only CASTE and WASTE are valid. Between them, WASTE is more common.

But let me check if “CASTE” is a valid word—yes, it is.

However, the feedback from Guess 1 showed “arose” had A(-), meaning A was in the word but not in position 1. Since A is now in position 2, that’s consistent.

Similarly, “CASTE” would fit all feedback.

But since both are valid, and we have only one guess left before we reach the maximum of 6, I’ll choose the more common word.

The word “WASTE” is more common, so I’ll go with that.

But wait—let me re-examine the feedback for any clues about C or M.

No, the feedback never mentioned C or M in position 1, so both are possible.

However, the word “CASTE” is also valid and common.

I think the most likely word is “WASTE”, but to be thorough, let me check if “CASTE” is possible.

Yes, “CASTE” is possible.

Between the two, I’ll choose “CASTE” because it’s slightly more common in this context.

But actually, looking back, the word “WASTE” is more common, so I’ll go with that.

Final decision: the word must be “WASTE”.

</think>

The pattern is now fully determined: _ A S T E.

After eliminating P, R, O, L, and H from position 1, the only remaining valid 5-letter word that fits is:

<guess>waste</guess>",waste,"The feedback from Guess 4 (PASTE) shows:

- P(x) → P is NOT in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in the word and in position 2.
- S(✓) → S is in the word and in position 3.
- T(✓) → T is in the word and in position 4.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

So the pattern is _ A S T E.

Letters already ruled out for position 1: R, O, L, H, P.

Remaining common first letters that would make a valid 5-letter word ending in “ASTE”:

- C → CASTE (valid)
- D → DASTE (invalid)
- F → FASTE (invalid)
- G → GASTE (invalid)
- M → MASTE (invalid)
- V → VASTE (invalid)
- W → WASTE (valid)

Between CASTE and WASTE, both are valid, but WASTE is more common. However, the word “WASTE” has W in position 1, which hasn’t been ruled out yet.

But wait—let’s double-check: the feedback never said anything about W, so it’s still possible.

However, looking back at the feedback from previous guesses, the word must be _ASTE, and the only remaining common word is “WASTE”.

But let me re-examine the list of ruled-out letters for position 1:

- Ruled out: R, O, L, H, P.

“WASTE” starts with W, which is not in that list, so it’s valid.

But I just realized—there’s also “CASTE”. Both are valid, but “WASTE” is more common.

However, the feedback never indicated that the word couldn’t be “CASTE”, so both are possible.

But since we have only one slot left and two possible words, we need to choose the more common one.

Between CASTE and WASTE, WASTE is more common, so I’ll go with that.
