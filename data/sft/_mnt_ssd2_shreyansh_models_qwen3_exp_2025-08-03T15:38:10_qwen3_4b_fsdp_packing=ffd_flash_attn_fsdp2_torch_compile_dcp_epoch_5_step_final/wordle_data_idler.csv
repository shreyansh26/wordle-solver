### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives me good information about the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", and ""CRANE"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels and 2 very common consonants, which should help me quickly identify or eliminate several letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S
- Contains R and E, but not in positions 2 or 5 respectively
- Has 5 distinct letters (since each letter in AROSE was either x or -)

Good next guesses should:
1. Use R and E in new positions
2. Introduce new common letters we haven't tested yet (like T, N, L, C, D, etc.)
3. Avoid A, O, S

A word that fits: ""INTER"" - it uses I, N, T, E, R and moves E to position 4 and R to position 5, while introducing new letters I, N, T.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - Letters not in the word: A, O, S
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: R, E (both previously marked “-”)

2. INTER → I(✓) N(x) T(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - I is now in the correct position (1st letter).
   - E is now in the correct position (4th letter).
   - R is now in the correct position (5th letter).
   - N and T are not in the word.

So we know the secret word looks like:
I _ _ E R

Letters still unknown: positions 2 and 3.
Letters already eliminated: A, O, S, N, T.
Letters already confirmed: I, E, R.

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 3. Common remaining consonants we haven’t tried yet include B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc. Vowels left are U (since A, O, E are handled).

Let’s try a word that fits the pattern I _ _ E R and uses common letters. One good candidate is “IVER” but that’s only 4 letters. Another is “IMMER” but that repeats M, which isn’t ideal. “IFWER” isn’t a valid word. “IDLER” is valid and uses common letters D and L.

Check: IDLER
- I (correct position 1)
- D (new letter, not yet eliminated)
- L (new letter, not yet eliminated)
- E (correct position 4)
- R (correct position 5)

This seems like a strong next guess.
