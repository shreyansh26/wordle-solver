### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Looking at common letters in English, the vowels A, E, I, O, U are very common, and consonants like S, T, R, N, L are also frequent. 

A strong starting word should cover a good spread of these letters. ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word early on.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the placement of letters and the inclusion of O. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, U, N, T  
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: S, E, I  
   – S is not in position 4 (from AROSE).  
   – E is not in position 5 (from AROSE) and also not in position 5 (from UNTIE).  
   – I is in the word but not in position 4 (from UNTIE).

So the secret word must contain the letters S, E, I exactly once each, and may not contain A, R, O, U, N, T.  
Remaining common letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the already-confirmed S, E, I.

We need a 5-letter word that uses S, E, I plus two new letters from the allowed set, while respecting the positional constraints:
- S ≠ 4  
- E ≠ 5  
- I ≠ 4

Let’s look for a word that spreads S, E, I across different positions and fills the remaining spots with fresh consonants.  
A good candidate is “SIEGH” (but H is rare).  
Another is “SLEEK” (but K is allowed, and E repeats – no good).  
“WISPE” – but P is allowed, W is allowed, but E repeats.  
“SPICE” – uses S, P, I, C, E.  
Check constraints:
- S is 1st → OK (not 4th)  
- E is 5th → NOT OK (forbidden)  
So “SPICE” fails.

Next candidate: “SIEGS” – but G is allowed, S repeats.  
“SPIKE” – uses S, P, I, K, E.  
Check positions:
- S 1st – OK  
- E 5th – NOT OK  

Next: “WIPES” – uses W, I, P, E, S.  
Positions:
- S 5th – OK (not 4th)  
- E 4th – OK (not 5th)  
- I 3rd – OK (not 4th)  
Letters: W, I, P, E, S – none are forbidden.  
This looks valid.

Let’s verify:  
Word: W I P E S  
- Contains S, E, I – correct.  
- S is 5th (allowed).  
- E is 4th (allowed).  
- I is 3rd (allowed).  
- W and P are new letters, not yet tested, and not forbidden.

Therefore, “WIPES” is a strong next guess.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Looking at common letters in English, the vowels A, E, I, O, U are very common, and consonants like S, T, R, N, L are also frequent. 

A strong starting word should cover a good spread of these letters. ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word early on.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the placement of letters and the inclusion of O. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, U, N, T  
2. Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: S, E, I  
   – S is not in position 4 (from AROSE).  
   – E is not in position 5 (from AROSE) and also not in position 5 (from UNTIE).  
   – I is in the word but not in position 4 (from UNTIE).

So the secret word must contain the letters S, E, I exactly once each, and may not contain A, R, O, U, N, T.  
Remaining common letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the already-confirmed S, E, I.

We need a 5-letter word that uses S, E, I plus two new letters from the allowed set, while respecting the positional constraints:
- S ≠ 4  
- E ≠ 5  
- I ≠ 4

Let’s look for a word that spreads S, E, I across different positions and fills the remaining spots with fresh consonants.  
A good candidate is “SIEGH” (but H is rare).  
Another is “SLEEK” (but K is allowed, and E repeats – no good).  
“WISPE” – but P is allowed, W is allowed, but E repeats.  
“SPICE” – uses S, P, I, C, E.  
Check constraints:
- S is 1st → OK (not 4th)  
- E is 5th → NOT OK (forbidden)  
So “SPICE” fails.

Next candidate: “SIEGS” – but G is allowed, S repeats.  
“SPIKE” – uses S, P, I, K, E.  
Check positions:
- S 1st – OK  
- E 5th – NOT OK  

Next: “WIPES” – uses W, I, P, E, S.  
Positions:
- S 5th – OK (not 4th)  
- E 4th – OK (not 5th)  
- I 3rd – OK (not 4th)  
Letters: W, I, P, E, S – none are forbidden.  
This looks valid.

Let’s verify:  
Word: W I P E S  
- Contains S, E, I – correct.  
- S is 5th (allowed).  
- E is 4th (allowed).  
- I is 3rd (allowed).  
- W and P are new letters, not yet tested, and not forbidden.

Therefore, “WIPES” is a strong next guess.

Let’s summarize what we now know after the three guesses.

Letters that are **not** in the word at all:  
A, R, O, U, N, T, W

Letters that **are** in the word:  
S, E, I, P  
(Each of these appears at least once in the feedback.)

Exact positional information we have:

1. E is in position 4 (from WIPES feedback: E✓).  
2. I is in the word but **not** in position 2 (from WIPES: I-).  
3. P is in the word but **not** in position 3 (from WIPES: P-).  
4. S is in the word but **not** in position 5 (from WIPES: S-).

So the secret word must be a permutation of {S, E, I, P, ?} where:
- E is fixed at position 4.  
- The remaining letters S, I, P must appear once each, and they may not be in the forbidden positions above.  
- The fifth letter must be one of the still-allowed consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, V, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 4.  
- Contains S, I, P once each, in allowed positions.  
- Has one additional letter from the allowed set.

Let’s list possible placements:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Fixed:    _ _ _ E _

Letters to place: S, I, P, plus one new letter.

We have these constraints:
- S ≠ 5  
- I ≠ 2  
- P ≠ 3  

Let’s try to construct a valid word:

Option: place P in position 1, I in position 3, S in position 2, and add a new letter (e.g., D) in position 5.  
Word: P S I E D → “PSIED” – not a valid English word.

Another option: place S in position 1, I in position 3, P in position 2, and add a new letter (e.g., L) in position 5.  
Word: S P I E L → “SPIEL” – valid English word (a short play or a bet).

Check constraints:
- E is in position 4 – ✓  
- S is in position 1 (allowed) – ✓  
- I is in position 3 (allowed) – ✓  
- P is in position 2 (allowed) – ✓  
- L is a new letter, not forbidden – ✓  

Therefore, “SPIEL” is a valid and strategic next guess.
