### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback.

A good strategy is to use a word with:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- These letters are among the most frequent in English words

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback.

A good strategy is to use a word with:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:

- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters

- E: in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A or O
- Contains R, S, E, but not in positions 2, 4, 5 respectively
- Has 5 letters total

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses R, S, E (since they’re confirmed in the word)
- Avoids A and O
- Places R, S, E in different positions than 2, 4, 5 (from the feedback)

Good positions to try:
- R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)
- S could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4)
- E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5)

Let’s pick a word that shifts these letters to new positions and adds new common letters that haven’t been tested yet. The word “TRIES” comes to mind:
- T, R, I, E, S
- Contains R, S, E in new positions (R in 2 → 3, S in 4 → 5, E in 5 → 4)
- Adds T and I (new letters not yet tested)
- Avoids A and O

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: TRIES -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) I(x) E(✓) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   – R, S, E are in the word but in wrong positions.
   – A and O are not in the word.

2. TRIES → T(x) R(-) I(x) E(✓) S(-)
   – E is now confirmed in position 4 (✓).
   – R, S are still in the word but still not in positions 2 or 5 respectively.
   – T and I are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word has the pattern: _ _ _ E _
- Contains R and S somewhere, but:
  – R not in position 2
  – S not in position 5
- Does not contain: A, O, T, I

Remaining common letters to test: N, L, C, D, M, P, U, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 4.
- Contains R and S in positions not yet ruled out.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but 4 is E), so 1, 3, or 5.
Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 5 is now excluded for S), so 1, 2, or 3.

Let’s try to place R and S in new positions and add new common consonants. A good candidate is “CRUEL”:
- C, R, U, E, L
- E is in position 4 (✓).
- R is in position 2 (was previously in 2, but feedback was “-” so position 2 is still wrong for R. Oops, can’t do that.)
Let’s rethink.

Try “SPREE” – but has two Es and E is already fixed in position 4, so invalid.

Try “PRESS” – has S in position 5 (invalid, feedback was S(-) in position 5).

Try “DRESS” – same issue with S in 5.

Try “FRESH” – E is in 4, R in 3 (allowed), S in 5 (invalid).

Try “BREED” – E in 4, R in 2 (invalid).

Try “CREST” – T is invalid.

Try “GRIPE” – E in 4, R in 2 (invalid).

Try “PRESS” again – S in 5 invalid.

Try “SPREE” – already noted issue.

Try “CRUEL” again – R in 2 invalid.

Let’s systematically:
- E is fixed at position 4.
- R can be 1, 3, or 5.
- S can be 1, 2, or 3.

Let’s try R in 1, S in 2: pattern R S _ E _
Possible word: R S _ E _ – need two more letters not in forbidden set. Let’s try “R S L E N” – not a word.

Try R in 1, S in 3: R _ S E _ – “R U S E D” – “RUSED” not a word.

Try R in 3, S in 2: _ S R E _ – “P S R E D” – not a word.

Try R in 5, S in 1: S _ _ E R – “S L U E R” – “SLUER” not common.

Try R in 5, S in 2: _ S _ E R – “M S H E R” – no.

Try R in 3, S in 1: S _ R E _ – “S H R E D” – “SHRED” is a valid word.

Check:
- S in 1 (allowed)
- H new letter
- R in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (✓)
- D new letter
- No forbidden letters (A, O, T, I)

“SHRED” seems valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback.

A good strategy is to use a word with:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- These letters are among the most frequent in English words

We now know the exact pattern:

S H R E _

and we have eliminated:

A, O, T, I, D, K

from being in position 5.  
The remaining common letters that have not been tried and are consonants are: B, C, F, G, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

The only standard 5-letter English word that fits S H R E _ and uses one of these remaining letters is:

S H R E N → “SHREN” (not valid)  
S H R E B → “SHREB” (not valid)  
S H R E C → “SHREC” (not valid)
