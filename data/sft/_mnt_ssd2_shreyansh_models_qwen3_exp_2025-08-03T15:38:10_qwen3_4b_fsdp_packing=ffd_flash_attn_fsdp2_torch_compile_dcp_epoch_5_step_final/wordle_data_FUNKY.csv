For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English like A, E, I, O, U, R, T, N, S, L, etc. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a strong starting word that includes several very common letters and can help narrow down vowels and consonants quickly.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means the word contains none of those letters.  
To maximize information, I should pick a word that uses entirely different letters, particularly common ones that weren’t ruled out.  
Good candidates avoid S, L, A, T, E entirely and instead use R, I, N, O, U, C, H, etc.  
A balanced choice is “CHURN”:  
- C, H, U, R, N are all new letters.  
- It covers several high-frequency consonants (C, H, R, N) and the vowel U.  
- It has no repeated letters, giving maximum coverage.

This should quickly narrow down remaining possibilities.

So far we know:
- The word contains no S, L, A, T, E, C, H, R.
- It DOES contain U and N, but not in their guessed positions (positions 3 and 5 respectively).
- Letters still possible: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the confirmed letters U and N.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses U and N in positions other than 3 and 5.
2. Avoids all the eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, H, R.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (but U is already confirmed)

Let’s try to place U and N in new positions and fill the rest with high-frequency remaining letters.  
A promising pattern is to put U in position 2 or 4 and N in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 5 since it was wrong there in CHURN).

One candidate:  
- Position 1: N (new position)  
- Position 2: U (new position)  
- Position 3: B (common)  
- Position 4: I (common vowel)  
- Position 5: K (common)

Word: N U B I K → ""NUBIK"" – but that’s not a valid English word.

Next candidate:  
- Position 1: B  
- Position 2: N  
- Position 3: U  
- Position 4: M  
- Position 5: I  

Word: B N U M I → ""BNUMI"" – invalid.

Another:  
- Position 1: M  
- Position 2: U  
- Position 3: N  
- Position 4: D  
- Position 5: I  

Word: M U N D I → ""Mundi"" – not standard.

Next:  
- Position 1: D  
- Position 2: U  
- Position 3: N  
- Position 4: I  
- Position 5: M  

Word: D U N I M → ""DUNIM"" – invalid.

Let’s try valid words systematically.  
A valid word that satisfies the constraints:  
- Uses U and N in new positions  
- Avoids all eliminated letters  
- Uses other common letters

One valid word: ""BUNNY"" – but it repeats N, which is inefficient.

Another: ""FUNGI"" – but F is allowed, U and N are in new positions (2 and 3), but G and I are allowed, but E is eliminated (but E is already out). Wait, Fungi is valid, but let’s check letters: F, U, N, G, I – none are in the banned list, and positions: U is in 2 (was in 3 before), N is in 3 (was in 5 before). This seems valid.

But ""FUNGI"" uses I and G, which are good. Let’s go with this.

Actually, ""FUNGI"" is a valid word meaning fungi (plural). It uses:
- F (new)  
- U (in position 2, new from 3)  
- N (in position 3, new from 5)  
- G (new)  
- I (new)

This seems optimal.

But let me check if there’s a simpler word. ""DUNNO"" – but repeats N and uses O (allowed), but O is allowed. However, N is in position 3 and 5, which is redundant.

Another: ""WOUND"" – but W is allowed, O is allowed, U is in position 2 (good), N is in position 3 (good), D is allowed. This seems good.

""WOUND"":
- W (new)  
- O (new)  
- U (position 2, new from 3)  
- N (position 3, new from 5)  
- D (new)

All letters are allowed and positions are valid.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English like A, E, I, O, U, R, T, N, S, L, etc. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

A promising pattern is to put U in position 2 or 4 and N in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 5 since it was wrong there in CHURN).

One candidate:  
- Position 1: N (new position)  
- Position 2: U (new position)  
- Position 3: B (common)  
- Position 4: I (common vowel)  
- Position 5: K (common)

Word: N U B I K → ""NUBIK"" – but that’s not a valid English word.

Next candidate:  
- Position 1: B  
- Position 2: N  
- Position 3: U  
- Position 4: M  
- Position 5: I  

Word: B N U M I → ""BNUMI"" – invalid.

Another:  
- Position 1: M  
- Position 2: U  
- Position 3: N  
- Position 4: D  
- Position 5: I  

Word: M U N D I → ""Mundi"" – not standard.

Next:  
- Position 1: D  
- Position 2: U  
- Position 3: N  
- Position 4: I  
- Position 5: M  

Word: D U N I M → ""DUNIM"" – invalid.

Let’s try valid words systematically.  
A valid word that satisfies the constraints:  
- Uses U and N in new positions  
- Avoids all eliminated letters  
- Uses other common letters

One valid word: ""BUNNY"" – but it repeats N, which is inefficient.

Another: ""FUNGI"" – but F is allowed, U and N are in new positions (2 and 3), but G and I are allowed, but E is eliminated (but E is already out). Wait, Fungi is valid, but let’s check letters: F, U, N, G, I – none are in the banned list, and positions: U is in 2 (was in 3 before), N is in 3 (was in 5 before). This seems valid.

But ""FUNGI"" uses I and G, which are good. Let’s go with this.

Actually, ""FUNGI"" is a valid word meaning fungi (plural). It uses:
- F (new)  
- U (in position 2, new from 3)  
- N (in position 3, new from 5)  
- G (new)  
- I (new)

This seems optimal.

But let me check if there’s a simpler word. ""DUNNO"" – but repeats N and uses O (allowed), but O is allowed. However, N is in position 3 and 5, which is redundant.

Another: ""WOUND"" – but W is allowed, O is allowed, U is in position 2 (good), N is in position 3 (good), D is allowed. This seems good.

""WOUND"":
- W (new)  
- O (new)  
- U (position 2, new from 3)  
- N (position 3, new from 5)  
- D (new)

All letters are allowed and positions are valid.

This seems like the best next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English like A, E, I, O, U, R, T, N, S, L, etc. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a strong starting word that includes several very common letters and can help narrow down vowels and consonants quickly.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means the word contains none of those letters.  
To maximize information, I should pick a word that uses entirely different letters, particularly common ones that weren’t ruled out.  
Good candidates avoid S, L, A, T, E entirely and instead use R, I, N, O, U, C, H, etc.  
A balanced choice is “CHURN”:  
- C, H, U, R, N are all new letters.  
- It covers several high-frequency consonants (C, H, R, N) and the vowel U.  
- It has no repeated letters, giving maximum coverage.

This should quickly narrow down remaining possibilities.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English like A, E, I, O, U, R, T, N, S, L, etc. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a strong starting word that includes several very common letters and can help narrow down vowels and consonants quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means the word contains none of those letters.  
To maximize information, I should pick a word that uses entirely different letters, particularly common ones that weren’t ruled out.  
Good candidates avoid S, L, A, T, E entirely and instead use R, I, N, O, U, C, H, etc.  
A balanced choice is “CHURN”:  
- C, H, U, R, N are all new letters.  
- It covers several high-frequency consonants (C, H, R, N) and the vowel U.  
- It has no repeated letters, giving maximum coverage.

This should quickly narrow down remaining possibilities.

So far we know:
- The word contains no S, L, A, T, E, C, H, R.
- It DOES contain U and N, but not in their guessed positions (positions 3 and 5 respectively).
- Letters still possible: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the confirmed letters U and N.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses U and N in positions other than 3 and 5.
2. Avoids all the eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, E, C, H, R.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (but U is already confirmed)

Let’s try to place U and N in new positions and fill the rest with high-frequency remaining letters.  
A promising pattern is to put U in position 2 or 4 and N in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 5 since it was wrong there in CHURN).

One candidate:  
- Position 1: N (new position)  
- Position 2: U (new position)  
- Position 3: B (common)  
- Position 4: I (common vowel)  
- Position 5: K (common)

Word: N U B I K → ""NUBIK"" – but that’s not a valid English word.

Next candidate:  
- Position 1: B  
- Position 2: N  
- Position 3: U  
- Position 4: M  
- Position 5: I  

Word: B N U M I → ""BNUMI"" – invalid.

Another:  
- Position 1: M  
- Position 2: U  
- Position 3: N  
- Position 4: D  
- Position 5: I  

Word: M U N D I → ""Mundi"" – not standard.

Next:  
- Position 1: D  
- Position 2: U  
- Position 3: N  
- Position 4: I  
- Position 5: M  

Word: D U N I M → ""DUNIM"" – invalid.

Let’s try valid words systematically.  
A valid word that satisfies the constraints:  
- Uses U and N in new positions  
- Avoids all eliminated letters  
- Uses other common letters

One valid word: ""BUNNY"" – but it repeats N, which is inefficient.

Another: ""FUNGI"" – but F is allowed, U and N are in new positions (2 and 3), but G and I are allowed, but E is eliminated (but E is already out). Wait, Fungi is valid, but let’s check letters: F, U, N, G, I – none are in the banned list, and positions: U is in 2 (was in 3 before), N is in 3 (was in 5 before). This seems valid.

But ""FUNGI"" uses I and G, which are good. Let’s go with this.

Actually, ""FUNGI"" is a valid word meaning fungi (plural). It uses:
- F (new)  
- U (in position 2, new from 3)  
- N (in position 3, new from 5)  
- G (new)  
- I (new)

This seems optimal.

But let me check if there’s a simpler word. ""DUNNO"" – but repeats N and uses O (allowed), but O is allowed. However, N is in position 3 and 5, which is redundant.

Another: ""WOUND"" – but W is allowed, O is allowed, U is in position 2 (good), N is in position 3 (good), D is allowed. This seems good.

""WOUND"":
- W (new)  
- O (new)  
- U (position 2, new from 3)  
- N (position 3, new from 5)  
- D (new)

All letters are allowed and positions are valid.

This seems like the best next guess.

2. CHURN → C(x) H(x) U(-) R(x) N(-)

3. WOUND → W(x) O(x) U(-) N(-) D(x)  
   Eliminates: W, O, D  
   Confirms: U and N are still in the word, and their positions are still not correct (they were in positions 3 and 5 again, so we now know:  
   - U is not in position 3  
   - N is not in position 5)

So far the eliminated letters are:  
S, L, A, T, E, C, H, R, W, O, D

Confirmed letters (must appear at least once): U, N

Remaining letters (still possible):  
B, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z, U, N

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both U and N  
- Does not contain any of the eliminated letters  
- Places U somewhere other than position 3  
- Places N somewhere other than position 5

Let’s look for common English words meeting these constraints.

Good candidates:
- BUNNY (but repeats N)  
- FUNGI (but F, G, I are allowed, U in 2, N in 3)  
- JUMPN (invalid)  
- KNUCK (invalid)

- PUNYI (invalid)  
- VULNU (invalid)

All allowed, U in position 2 (allowed), N in position 3 (allowed).

Another valid word: MUNGE (but E is eliminated).  
Another: PUNY (4 letters).  
Another: KNUCK (invalid).  
Another: GUNNY (but G, U, N, N, Y – repeats N).

Best valid word: FUNGI.

From the feedback on FUNNY:

- F(✓)  – correct in position 1  
- U(✓) – correct in position 2  
- N(✓) – correct in position 3  
- N(-) – the second N is in the word but NOT in position 4  
- Y(✓) – correct in position 5  

So the word is of the form: F U N _ Y  
The missing letter (position 4) must be a single letter that:
- has not been eliminated yet  
- is not N (because the second N is already known to be in the word but not in position 4)

Letters already eliminated: S, L, A, T, E, C, H, R, W, O, D, G, I  
Remaining possible letters for position 4: B, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Z

- FUNPY – not a word  
- FUNQY – not a word  
- FUNVY – not a word  
- FUNXY – not a word  
- FUNZY – not a word  

The only valid word that fits is FUNNY itself, but we already tried it and the second N was marked as “in word but wrong position”, so the word must contain an extra N somewhere other than position 4. The only remaining possibility is that the word has two Ns, one in position 3 and another in position 4, but the feedback says the second N is NOT in position 4. This seems contradictory.

Wait, let’s re-examine the feedback carefully:

Guess 5: FUNNY -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) U(✓) N(✓) N(-) Y(✓)

The feedback symbols are applied to each letter in order:
1. F – correct position (position 1)  
2. U – correct position (position 2)  
3. N – correct position (position 3)  
4. N – in word but wrong position (position 4)  
5. Y – correct position (position 5)

This implies the word has:
- F in position 1  
- U in position 2  
- N in position 3  
- another N somewhere else (but not position 4)  
- Y in position 5  

The only remaining position for the second N is position 4, but the feedback says it’s not in position 4. This seems impossible unless the word is actually F U N N Y, which would place the second N in position 4, contradicting the feedback.

However, the feedback must be interpreted as:
- The first N (position 3) is correct.  
- The second N (position 4) is in the word but not in position 4.  
This implies the word must have two Ns, one in position 3 and one elsewhere, but position 5 is already Y, so the other N must be in position 4, which contradicts the feedback.

This suggests the only possible word is F U N N Y, and the feedback must indicate that the second N is in the word but not in position 4, which is impossible because the word has no other positions left for N. This implies the word must indeed be F U N N Y, and the feedback symbols may have been misinterpreted.

Upon closer inspection, the feedback symbols are applied to each letter in the guess in order. Since the word has two Ns, one in position 3 and one in position 4, the feedback would show:
- First N (position 3) as ✓  
- Second N (position 4) as ✓ (correct position) or - (wrong position) depending on actual word.

Given the feedback shows N(-) in position 4, this implies the actual word does NOT have an N in position 4. Therefore, the word must have only one N in position 3, and the second N in the guess is extra. This suggests the word is F U N _ Y with no second N, but we have no other N to place.

This seems like a contradiction, but the only valid word that fits all feedback is F U N N Y, and the feedback must indicate that the second N is in the word but not in position 4, which is impossible unless the word is F U N N Y. This suggests the word must be F U N N Y, and the feedback symbols may have been misinterpreted.

Re-evaluating: The feedback for FUNNY shows:
- F(✓) – correct in position 1  
- U(✓) – correct in position 2  
- N(✓) – correct in position 3  
- N(-) – in word but wrong position (position 4)  
- Y(✓) – correct in position 5  

This implies the word has:
- F, U, N, Y in the exact positions shown  
- an additional N somewhere, but positions 1-5 are already filled, so this is impossible.

This suggests the only possible word is F U N N Y, and the feedback must have intended to show the second N as ✓, not -, indicating the word is indeed F U N N Y.

Given this, the correct word is F U N N Y.
