1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 5 unique letters (A, R, O, S, E) which are all very common.
2. These letters appear in many 5-letter words, so we'll get good coverage.
3. It's a valid English word itself.

This should give us strong feedback on which of these common letters are in the word and their positions.

1. Has S in position 4.
2. Uses A somewhere not at position 1.
3. Avoids R, O, E.

- I, N, T are all common letters not ruled out.
- S is in position 4 as required.

From the two previous guesses:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - S is in position 4.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.

2. faint → F(x) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   - F, I, N, T are not in the word at all.
   - A is still in the word but not in position 2 either (because the second guess had A in position 2 and it was still “-”).

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ S _
- Must contain A, but A cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- Forbidden letters: R, O, E, F, I, N, T.
- Remaining common letters to try: C, L, D, G, B, U, M, P, H, K, Y, W, V, S (already used), etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S in position 4.
- Has A in position 3 or 5 (since it can’t be 1 or 2).
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try “BLUSH”:
- B, L, U, S, H – all allowed so far.
- S is in position 4 (✓).
- A is not present here, so this won’t test A. We need a word that includes A.

Next candidate: “GASPS” – but S is already in position 4, and we can’t have S in position 5 because S is already confirmed in position 4 (and we don’t know yet if S appears only once or multiple times). Also, P hasn’t been tested yet.

Better: “CASHY” – but Y is less common, and we don’t know about Y yet.

Another: “BASKS” – S is in position 4, A in position 2 (but A can’t be in position 2). So invalid.

Next: “HABAS” – but A appears twice and S is in position 4, but this seems less likely.

Let’s try “CASSY” – but S appears twice, and we don’t know if S appears multiple times.

A better approach is to place A in position 3 (since position 5 might be harder to test with). So pattern: _ _ A S _

Candidate: “DAMPS” – D, A, M, P, S. S is in position 4, A in position 2 (but A can’t be in position 2). Invalid.

Next: “GAMAS” – but A is in position 2 again. Invalid.

Next: “LAMAS” – same issue with A in position 2.

Next: “PASSE” – E is forbidden. Invalid.

Next: “WASPS” – S is in position 4, A in position 2 (invalid).

Next: “BASKS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

Next: “MADAS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

Next: “GASPS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

Next: “HABIT” – but T is forbidden.

Next: “HAIRY” – but I is forbidden.

Next: “HABIT” – T is forbidden.

Next: “HABIT” – T is forbidden.

Next: “HABIT” – T is forbidden.

Wait, let’s systematically list possible positions:
- Pattern: _ _ _ S _
- A must be in position 3 or 5 (since it can’t be 1 or 2).
- Position 5: if A is in position 5, then pattern is _ _ _ S A.
- Position 3: pattern is _ _ A S _.

Let’s try position 3 first: _ _ A S _
Candidate letters left (excluding forbidden): C, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- “CHASK” – but K is allowed, but S is in position 4. Pattern: C H A S K – but this has K in position 5, which is fine. However, this uses K which is less common.

- “PLAYS” – but Y is allowed, A is in position 2 (invalid).

- “MASSY” – S appears twice, Y is allowed, A is in position 2 (invalid).

- “WASPS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

- “BASSY” – A in position 2 (invalid).

- “DASHY” – A in position 2 (invalid).

- “GASPS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

- “HABIT” – T is forbidden.

- “HABIT” – T is forbidden.

- “HABIT” – T is forbidden.

This seems problematic. Maybe A is in position 5 instead: pattern _ _ _ S A.

Candidate words:
- “BLUSH” – but no A.

- “CHUCK” – no A.

- “DUMPS” – no A.

- “GUMPS” – no A.

- “HUMPS” – no A.

- “LUMPS” – no A.

- “MUMPS” – no A.

- “PUMPS” – no A.

- “WUMPS” – no A.

- “BUMPY” – no A.

- “CUBAS” – A is in position 5, S in position 4. Pattern: C U B A S – but S must be in position 4, so this would be C U B S A, but A is in position 5. This word is CUBAS, which is C U B A S – but S is in position 4, A in position 5. This fits the pattern _ _ _ S A.

Let’s check:
- C, U, B, S, A – all allowed so far.
- S is in position 4 (✓).
- A is in position 5 (allowed, since A can’t be in positions 1 or 2).
- No forbidden letters.

So “CUBAS” seems valid. However, is it a common word? Maybe “CUBAS” is acceptable.

Alternatively, “MUSAS” – but S is in position 4, A in position 5: M U S A S – but S is in position 3 here, which conflicts with S needing to be in position 4.

Another: “HUSKS” – S is in position 4, A is missing.

“PUSKS” – no A.

“DUSKS” – no A.

“GUSKS” – no A.

“LUSKS” – no A.

“WUSKS” – no A.

“BASKS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“DASKS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“GASKS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“HASKS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“LASKS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“MASKS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“PASKS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“TASKS” – T is forbidden.

“VASKS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“YASKS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“BASAS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“CABAS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“GABAS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“LABAS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“MABAS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“PABAS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“SABAS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“TABAS” – T is forbidden.

“VABAS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“YABAS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

This seems very restrictive. Maybe we need to try position 3 with other letters.

Pattern: _ _ A S _
Possible words:
- “CHALK” – but K is allowed, pattern: C H A S K – but S is in position 4, A in position 3. This fits.

Check letters: C, H, A, S, K – all allowed so far.
- C: allowed
- H: allowed
- A: allowed in position 3
- S: in position 4 (✓)
- K: allowed

This seems valid. “CHALK” is a common word.

Let’s go with “CHALK”.
</think>

From the feedback:
- S is locked in position 4.
- A must appear somewhere, but not in positions 1 or 2.
- Forbidden letters: R, O, E, F, I, N, T.

A good next word places A in position 3 and uses common remaining letters: C, H, K.

A better approach is to place A in position 3 (since position 5 might be harder to test with). So pattern: _ _ A S _

Candidate: “DAMPS” – D, A, M, P, S. S is in position 4, A in position 2 (but A can’t be in position 2). Invalid.

Next: “GAMAS” – but A is in position 2 again. Invalid.

Next: “LAMAS” – same issue with A in position 2.

Next: “PASSE” – E is forbidden. Invalid.

Next: “WASPS” – S is in position 4, A in position 2 (invalid).

Next: “BASKS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

Next: “MADAS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

Next: “GASPS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

Next: “HABIT” – but T is forbidden.

Next: “HAIRY” – but I is forbidden.

Next: “HABIT” – T is forbidden.

Next: “HABIT” – T is forbidden.

Next: “HABIT” – T is forbidden.

Wait, let’s systematically list possible positions:
- Pattern: _ _ _ S _
- A must be in position 3 or 5 (since it can’t be 1 or 2).
- Position 5: if A is in position 5, then pattern is _ _ _ S A.
- Position 3: pattern is _ _ A S _.

Let’s try position 3 first: _ _ A S _
Candidate letters left (excluding forbidden): C, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- “CHASK” – but K is allowed, but S is in position 4. Pattern: C H A S K – but this has K in position 5, which is fine. However, this uses K which is less common.

- “PLAYS” – but Y is allowed, A is in position 2 (invalid).

- “MASSY” – S appears twice, Y is allowed, A is in position 2 (invalid).

- “WASPS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

- “BASSY” – A in position 2 (invalid).

- “DASHY” – A in position 2 (invalid).

- “GASPS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

- “HABIT” – T is forbidden.

- “HABIT” – T is forbidden.

- “HABIT” – T is forbidden.

This seems problematic. Maybe A is in position 5 instead: pattern _ _ _ S A.

Candidate words:
- “BLUSH” – but no A.

- “CHUCK” – no A.

- “DUMPS” – no A.

- “GUMPS” – no A.

- “HUMPS” – no A.

- “LUMPS” – no A.

- “MUMPS” – no A.

- “PUMPS” – no A.

- “WUMPS” – no A.

- “BUMPY” – no A.

- “CUBAS” – A is in position 5, S in position 4. Pattern: C U B A S – but S must be in position 4, so this would be C U B S A, but A is in position 5. This word is CUBAS, which is C U B A S – but S is in position 4, A in position 5. This fits the pattern _ _ _ S A.

Let’s check:
- C, U, B, S, A – all allowed so far.
- S is in position 4 (✓).
- A is in position 5 (allowed, since A can’t be in positions 1 or 2).
- No forbidden letters.

So “CUBAS” seems valid. However, is it a common word? Maybe “CUBAS” is acceptable.

Alternatively, “MUSAS” – but S is in position 4, A in position 5: M U S A S – but S is in position 3 here, which conflicts with S needing to be in position 4.

Another: “HUSKS” – S is in position 4, A is missing.

“PUSKS” – no A.

“DUSKS” – no A.

“GUSKS” – no A.

“LUSKS” – no A.

“WUSKS” – no A.

“BASKS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“DASKS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“GASKS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“HASKS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“LASKS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“MASKS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“PASKS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“TASKS” – T is forbidden.

“VASKS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“YASKS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“BASAS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“MABAS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“PABAS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“SABAS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“TABAS” – T is forbidden.

“VABAS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

“YABAS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

This seems very restrictive. Maybe we need to try position 3 with other letters.

Pattern: _ _ A S _
Possible words:
- “CHALK” – but K is allowed, pattern: C H A S K – but S is in position 4, A in position 3. This fits.

Check letters: C, H, A, S, K – all allowed so far.
- C: allowed
- H: allowed
- A: allowed in position 3
- S: in position 4 (✓)
- K: allowed

This seems valid. “CHALK” is a common word.

Let’s go with “CHALK”.From the feedback:
- S is locked in position 4.
- A must appear somewhere, but not in positions 1 or 2.
- Forbidden letters: R, O, E, F, I, N, T.

A good next word places A in position 3 and uses common remaining letters: C, H, K.",Guess 3: chalk -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) A(✓) L(-) K(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 5 unique letters (A, R, O, S, E) which are all very common.
2. These letters appear in many 5-letter words, so we'll get good coverage.
3. It's a valid English word itself.

This should give us strong feedback on which of these common letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(✓) – S is in the word and in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word has an S in the 4th position.
- The word contains an A, but not at the start.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, or E.

Good next letters to try (still common and not ruled out): T, I, N, L, C, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, J, Q.

I want a word that:
1. Has S in position 4.
2. Uses A somewhere not at position 1.
3. Avoids R, O, E.
4. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “FAINT”:
- F is common and not ruled out.
- A is in position 2 (not position 1, satisfying the feedback).
- I, N, T are all common letters not ruled out.
- S is in position 4 as required.
- The word is valid.

This should give us more information about F, I, N, T, and confirm or deny the placement of A.

Guess 2: faint -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
   - S is in position 4.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.

2. faint → F(x) A(-) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   - F, I, N, T are not in the word at all.
   - A is still in the word but not in position 2 either (because the second guess had A in position 2 and it was still “-”).

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ S _
- Must contain A, but A cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- Forbidden letters: R, O, E, F, I, N, T.
- Remaining common letters to try: C, L, D, G, B, U, M, P, H, K, Y, W, V, S (already used), etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S in position 4.
- Has A in position 3 or 5 (since it can’t be 1 or 2).
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try “BLUSH”:
- B, L, U, S, H – all allowed so far.
- S is in position 4 (✓).
- A is not present here, so this won’t test A. We need a word that includes A.

Next candidate: “GASPS” – but S is already in position 4, and we can’t have S in position 5 because S is already confirmed in position 4 (and we don’t know yet if S appears only once or multiple times). Also, P hasn’t been tested yet.

Better: “CASHY” – but Y is less common, and we don’t know about Y yet.

Another: “BASKS” – S is in position 4, A in position 2 (but A can’t be in position 2). So invalid.

Next: “HABAS” – but A appears twice and S is in position 4, but this seems less likely.

Let’s try “CASSY” – but S appears twice, and we don’t know if S appears multiple times.

A better approach is to place A in position 3 (since position 5 might be harder to test with). So pattern: _ _ A S _

Candidate: “DAMPS” – D, A, M, P, S. S is in position 4, A in position 2 (but A can’t be in position 2). Invalid.

Next: “GAMAS” – but A is in position 2 again. Invalid.

Next: “LAMAS” – same issue with A in position 2.

Next: “PASSE” – E is forbidden. Invalid.

Next: “WASPS” – S is in position 4, A in position 2 (invalid).

Next: “BASKS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

Next: “MADAS” – A in position 2 (invalid).

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Known facts:
1. S is in position 4 (from arose).
2. A is in the word and is in position 3 (from chalk).
3. C is in position 1 (from chalk).
4. Forbidden letters so far: R, O, E, F, I, N, T, H, K.
5. Pattern so far: C _ A S _
6. L is in the word but not in position 4 (from chalk).

Therefore the word must be: C _ A S L   (because L must appear somewhere and the only remaining slot is position 5).

Check the letters:
- C (position 1): ✓
- ? (position 2): unknown, must be a letter not yet ruled out.
- A (position 3): ✓
- S (position 4): ✓
- L (position 5): must be present, and since it was “-” in position 4, it must be here.

So the word is C _ A S L. The missing letter in position 2 must be one we have not yet tried and is not forbidden. Available letters (common ones left): B, D, G, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching C _ A S L:
- CADSL – not a word.
- CAMSL – not a word.
- CAPSL – not a word.
- CAGSL – not a word.
- CABSL – not a word.
- CUSCL – not a word.
- CUSAL – not a word.
- CAVSL – not a word.
- CAVAL – not a word.
- CAVAS – no L.
- CAVAL – no S.
- CAVAS – no L.

Wait, let’s list actual words ending in “ASL”:
- “ASL” is a valid ending for “C” + “A” + “S” + “L”.

The only common word fitting C _ A S L is “CABSL” – but that’s not a word. Next possibility: “CAVSL” – not a word.

Actually, the only common word that fits is “C” + “A” + “S” + “L” with a valid letter in position 2 is “C” + “A” + “S” + “L”.

But looking at it again, the pattern is C _ A S L, so the second letter must be a single letter. The only common word that fits is “C” + “A” + “S” + “L”.

But let me think of actual words:
- “CABSL” – not a word.
- “CADSL” – not a word.
- “CAMSL” – not a word.
- “CAPSL” – not a word.
- “CAVSL” – not a word.
- “CAGSL” – not a word.
- “CDSAL” – not a word.
- “CGASL” – not a word.
- “CMASL” – not a word.
- “CPASL” – not a word.
- “CVASL” – not a word.
- “CZASL” – not a word.

This seems impossible. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, the feedback for chalk was:
C(✓) H(x) A(✓) L(-) K(x)

This means:
- C is correct in position 1.
- H is not in the word.
- A is correct in position 3.
- L is in the word but not in position 4.
- K is not in the word.

So the word is C _ A S _ and must contain L somewhere not in position 4. The only possible positions for L are 2 or 5.

But position 2 is currently blank. So possible words:
- C L A S _ – but then L is in position 2, and the last letter must be a letter not yet used and not forbidden. Available letters: B, D, G, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common words:
- CLASP – but S is in position 4, so this would be C L A S P – but P is allowed, and this is a valid word.

Check letters:
C(1) ✓, L(2), A(3) ✓, S(4) ✓, P(5) – all allowed.

This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be CLASP.
