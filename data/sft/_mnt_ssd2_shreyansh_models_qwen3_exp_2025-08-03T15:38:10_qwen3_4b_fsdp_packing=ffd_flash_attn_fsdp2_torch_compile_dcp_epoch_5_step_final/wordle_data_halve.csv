### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. A good starting word often includes multiple vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A strong starting word would combine these. 

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - heavy on vowels
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers several common letters and vowels, giving good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S (x) – not in the word at all
- L (-) – in the word but not in position 2
- A (-) – in the word but not in position 3
- T (x) – not in the word at all
- E (✓) – in the word and in position 5

So far we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains L and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- It does NOT contain S or T.

We need a word that:
- Ends with E
- Has L somewhere other than position 2
- Has A somewhere other than position 3
- No S or T

Good letters to try next: R, N, I, C, O, U, D, etc.

Let’s try a word that places A and L in new positions while introducing new common letters. A good candidate is ""CRANE"":
- C (new letter)
- R (new letter)
- A (known to be in word, now in position 3 – but feedback said A is not in position 3, so this is bad)
Oops, that’s invalid because A can’t be in position 3.

Next candidate: ""ALONE""
- A (known, now in position 1 – allowed)
- L (known, now in position 2 – but feedback said L is not in position 2, so invalid)

Next: ""RAISE"" – contains S (invalid)
""LAIRE"" – not a common word
""AROSE"" – contains S (invalid)
""CLEAN"" – ends with N, not E
""ELAND"" – ends with D
""LEANT"" – ends with T (invalid)

Better to try ""AROSE"" but it has S. Let’s try ""ARISE"" – again has S.

Alternative: ""ALIEN""
- A in 1 (allowed)
- L in 2 (but feedback said L is not in 2) – invalid

Next: ""ELDER"" – ends with R
""OLDER"" – ends with R
""ALDER"" – ends with R

Let’s try ""ADIEU"" – ends with U
""ADORE"" – ends with E
- A in 1 (allowed)
- D (new)
- O (new)
- R (new)
- E in 5 (correct)

This seems valid:
- Contains A and L? Wait, no L in ADORE – we must include L.

So we need a word with A, L, E, and no S/T. Let’s try ""LAURE"" – but that’s not a common word.

""LAPEL"" – ends with L
""LEPER"" – ends with R
""LEVER"" – ends with R
""LEVEL"" – ends with L

""ELVER"" – ends with R

""ALLEY"" – ends with Y
""ALLEY"" – not 5 letters ending E.

""ALLEE"" – 5 letters ending E
- A in 1 (allowed)
- L in 2 (but L can’t be in 2)
Invalid.

""ALOHE"" – not a word
""ALONE"" – A in 1, L in 2 (invalid)

""ALOPE"" – not a word
""ALVER"" – ends with R

""ELAID"" → this is actually a valid word (a type of water sprite in Scottish folklore) but it’s obscure.

Let’s try ""ELAID"" as it’s the only valid word I can find that fits all constraints:
- Ends with E
- Contains L (in position 2, but feedback only said L is not in position 2, so this is invalid)

Wait, ""ELAID"" has L in position 2, which conflicts with feedback.

Let me think differently: we need a word with A (not in position 3), L (not in position 2), and E in position 5.

Possible structure: _ _ _ _ E

Let’s try ""ALDER"":
- A in 1 (allowed)
- L in 2 (but feedback says L is not in 2) → invalid

""ADLER"":
- A in 1 (allowed)
- D (new)
- L in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (but E must be in 5) → invalid

""ALDER"" already invalid.

""AROSE"" – contains S (invalid)

""ARISE"" – contains S (invalid)

""ALOHE"" – not a word

""ALOPE"" – not a word

""ALVER"" – ends with R

""ALOKE"" – not a word

""ALONE"" – A in 1, L in 2 (invalid)

""ALOGE"" – not a word

""ALMEE"" – not a word

""ALGAE"" – ends with E, has A, L
- A in 3 (but A cannot be in 3) → invalid

""ANGLE"" – ends with E, has A, L
- A in 2 (allowed)
- L in 4 (allowed)
- N (new)
- G (new)
- E in 5 (correct)

This seems valid:
- Contains A and L
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- L is in position 4 (allowed)
- No S or T
- New letters N and G introduced

Let’s try ANGLE.
</think>

<guess>ANGLE</guess>",ANGLE,"From the feedback on SLATE:
- S (x) – not in the word at all
- L (-) – in the word but not in position 2
- A (-) – in the word but not in position 3
- T (x) – not in the word at all
- E (✓) – in the word and in position 5

So far we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains L and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- It does NOT contain S or T.

We need a word that:
- Ends with E
- Has L somewhere other than position 2
- Has A somewhere other than position 3
- No S or T

Good letters to try next: R, N, I, C, O, U, D, etc.

Let’s try a word that places A and L in new positions while introducing new common letters. A good candidate is ""CRANE"":
- C (new letter)
- R (new letter)
- A (known to be in word, now in position 3 – but feedback said A is not in position 3, so this is bad)
Oops, that’s invalid because A can’t be in position 3.

- A (known, now in position 1 – allowed)
- L (known, now in position 2 – but feedback said L is not in position 2, so invalid)

Next: ""RAISE"" – contains S (invalid)
""LAIRE"" – not a common word
""AROSE"" – contains S (invalid)
""CLEAN"" – ends with N, not E
""ELAND"" – ends with D
""LEANT"" – ends with T (invalid)

Better to try ""AROSE"" but it has S. Let’s try ""ARISE"" – again has S.

Alternative: ""ALIEN""
- A in 1 (allowed)
- L in 2 (but feedback said L is not in 2) – invalid

Next: ""ELDER"" – ends with R
""OLDER"" – ends with R

Let’s try ""ADIEU"" – ends with U
""ADORE"" – ends with E
- A in 1 (allowed)
- D (new)
- O (new)

- E in 5 (correct)

This seems valid:
- Contains A and L? Wait, no L in ADORE – we must include L.

So we need a word with A, L, E, and no S/T. Let’s try ""LAURE"" – but that’s not a common word.

""LAPEL"" – ends with L
""LEPER"" – ends with R
""LEVER"" – ends with R
""LEVEL"" – ends with L

""ELVER"" – ends with R

""ELAID"" → this is actually a valid word (a type of water sprite in Scottish folklore) but it’s obscure.

Let’s try ""ELAID"" as it’s the only valid word I can find that fits all constraints:
- Ends with E
- Contains L (in position 2, but feedback only said L is not in position 2, so this is invalid)

Wait, ""ELAID"" has L in position 2, which conflicts with feedback.

Let me think differently: we need a word with A (not in position 3), L (not in position 2), and E in position 5.

Possible structure: _ _ _ _ E

Let’s try ""ALDER"":
- A in 1 (allowed)
- L in 2 (but feedback says L is not in 2) → invalid

""ADLER"":
- A in 1 (allowed)
- D (new)
- L in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (but E must be in 5) → invalid

""ALDER"" already invalid.

""AROSE"" – contains S (invalid)

""ARISE"" – contains S (invalid)

""ALOHE"" – not a word

""ALOPE"" – not a word

""ALVER"" – ends with R

""ALOKE"" – not a word

""ALONE"" – A in 1, L in 2 (invalid)

""ALOGE"" – not a word

""ALMEE"" – not a word

""ALGAE"" – ends with E, has A, L
- A in 3 (but A cannot be in 3) → invalid

""ANGLE"" – ends with E, has A, L
- A in 2 (allowed)
- L in 4 (allowed)
- N (new)
- G (new)
- E in 5 (correct)

This seems valid:
- Contains A and L
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- L is in position 4 (allowed)
- No S or T
- New letters N and G introduced

Let’s try ANGLE.",Guess 2: ANGLE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(x) G(x) L(-) E(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. A good starting word often includes multiple vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A strong starting word would combine these. 

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - heavy on vowels
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers several common letters and vowels, giving good coverage for the first guess.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S (x) – not in the word at all
- L (-) – in the word but not in position 2
- A (-) – in the word but not in position 3
- T (x) – not in the word at all
- E (✓) – in the word and in position 5

So far we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains L and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- It does NOT contain S or T.

We need a word that:
- Ends with E
- Has L somewhere other than position 2
- Has A somewhere other than position 3
- No S or T

Good letters to try next: R, N, I, C, O, U, D, etc.

Let’s try a word that places A and L in new positions while introducing new common letters. A good candidate is ""CRANE"":
- C (new letter)
- R (new letter)
- A (known to be in word, now in position 3 – but feedback said A is not in position 3, so this is bad)
Oops, that’s invalid because A can’t be in position 3.

Next candidate: ""ALONE""
- A (known, now in position 1 – allowed)
- L (known, now in position 2 – but feedback said L is not in position 2, so invalid)

Next: ""RAISE"" – contains S (invalid)
""LAIRE"" – not a common word
""AROSE"" – contains S (invalid)
""CLEAN"" – ends with N, not E
""ELAND"" – ends with D
""LEANT"" – ends with T (invalid)

Better to try ""AROSE"" but it has S. Let’s try ""ARISE"" – again has S.

Alternative: ""ALIEN""
- A in 1 (allowed)
- L in 2 (but feedback said L is not in 2) – invalid

Next: ""ELDER"" – ends with R
""OLDER"" – ends with R
""ALDER"" – ends with R

Let’s try ""ADIEU"" – ends with U
""ADORE"" – ends with E
- A in 1 (allowed)
- D (new)
- O (new)
- R (new)
- E in 5 (correct)

This seems valid:
- Contains A and L? Wait, no L in ADORE – we must include L.

So we need a word with A, L, E, and no S/T. Let’s try ""LAURE"" – but that’s not a common word.

""LAPEL"" – ends with L
""LEPER"" – ends with R
""LEVER"" – ends with R
""LEVEL"" – ends with L

""ELVER"" – ends with R

""ALLEY"" – ends with Y
""ALLEY"" – not 5 letters ending E.

""ALLEE"" – 5 letters ending E
- A in 1 (allowed)
- L in 2 (but L can’t be in 2)
Invalid.

""ELAID"" → this is actually a valid word (a type of water sprite in Scottish folklore) but it’s obscure.

Let’s try ""ELAID"" as it’s the only valid word I can find that fits all constraints:
- Ends with E
- Contains L (in position 2, but feedback only said L is not in position 2, so this is invalid)

Wait, ""ELAID"" has L in position 2, which conflicts with feedback.

Let me think differently: we need a word with A (not in position 3), L (not in position 2), and E in position 5.

Possible structure: _ _ _ _ E

Let’s try ""ALDER"":
- A in 1 (allowed)
- L in 2 (but feedback says L is not in 2) → invalid

""ADLER"":
- A in 1 (allowed)
- D (new)
- L in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (but E must be in 5) → invalid

""ALDER"" already invalid.

""AROSE"" – contains S (invalid)

""ARISE"" – contains S (invalid)

""ALOHE"" – not a word

""ALOPE"" – not a word

""ALVER"" – ends with R

""ALOKE"" – not a word

""ALONE"" – A in 1, L in 2 (invalid)

""ALOGE"" – not a word

""ALMEE"" – not a word

""ALGAE"" – ends with E, has A, L
- A in 3 (but A cannot be in 3) → invalid

""ANGLE"" – ends with E, has A, L
- A in 2 (allowed)
- L in 4 (allowed)
- N (new)
- G (new)
- E in 5 (correct)

This seems valid:
- Contains A and L
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- L is in position 4 (allowed)
- No S or T
- New letters N and G introduced

Let’s try ANGLE.

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. ANGLE → A(-) N(x) G(x) L(-) E(✓)

   - L is in the word but not in position 4 (it was marked “-” in position 4).
   - N and G are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely present: A, L, E (with E locked at position 5).
- Letters definitely absent: S, T, N, G.
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 4.
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains A and L.
- A is in position 2 or 4 (since it can’t be 1 or 3).
- L is in position 1, 3, or 5 (but 5 is already E), so 1 or 3.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible patterns:
- L _ A _ E  (L in 1, A in 3) → but A cannot be in 3.
- _ L A _ E  (L in 2) → but L cannot be in 2.
- _ _ L A E  (L in 3, A in 4) → possible.
- A _ L _ E  (A in 1) → but A cannot be in 1.
- _ A L _ E  (A in 2, L in 3) → possible.

So two viable patterns:
1. _ _ L A E  (L in 3, A in 4)
2. _ A L _ E  (A in 2, L in 3)

Let’s explore the second pattern first: _ A L _ E
We need a consonant in position 1 and a consonant in position 4.
Letters available (excluding S, T, N, G): B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, P, R, W, Y.

Let’s try:
- B A L _ E → BALOE? (not a word)
- C A L _ E → CALVE? (has V, but E is already at 5)
- D A L _ E → DALIE? (not a word)
- F A L _ E → FABLE? (B is allowed, L in 3, A in 2, E in 5) → FABLE is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- Ends with E: yes.
- Contains A, L: yes.
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- L in position 3 (allowed).
- No S, T, N, G: yes.

FABLE seems perfect.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. A good starting word often includes multiple vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A strong starting word would combine these. 

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - heavy on vowels
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers several common letters and vowels, giving good coverage for the first guess.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S (x) – not in the word at all
- L (-) – in the word but not in position 2
- A (-) – in the word but not in position 3
- T (x) – not in the word at all
- E (✓) – in the word and in position 5

So far we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains L and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- It does NOT contain S or T.

We need a word that:
- Ends with E
- Has L somewhere other than position 2
- Has A somewhere other than position 3
- No S or T

Good letters to try next: R, N, I, C, O, U, D, etc.

Let’s try a word that places A and L in new positions while introducing new common letters. A good candidate is ""CRANE"":
- C (new letter)
- R (new letter)
- A (known to be in word, now in position 3 – but feedback said A is not in position 3, so this is bad)
Oops, that’s invalid because A can’t be in position 3.

Next candidate: ""ALONE""
- A (known, now in position 1 – allowed)
- L (known, now in position 2 – but feedback said L is not in position 2, so invalid)

Next: ""RAISE"" – contains S (invalid)
""LAIRE"" – not a common word
""AROSE"" – contains S (invalid)
""CLEAN"" – ends with N, not E
""ELAND"" – ends with D
""LEANT"" – ends with T (invalid)

Better to try ""AROSE"" but it has S. Let’s try ""ARISE"" – again has S.

Alternative: ""ALIEN""
- A in 1 (allowed)
- L in 2 (but feedback said L is not in 2) – invalid

Next: ""ELDER"" – ends with R
""OLDER"" – ends with R
""ALDER"" – ends with R

Let’s try ""ADIEU"" – ends with U
""ADORE"" – ends with E
- A in 1 (allowed)
- D (new)
- O (new)
- R (new)
- E in 5 (correct)

This seems valid:
- Contains A and L? Wait, no L in ADORE – we must include L.

So we need a word with A, L, E, and no S/T. Let’s try ""LAURE"" – but that’s not a common word.

""LAPEL"" – ends with L
""LEPER"" – ends with R
""LEVER"" – ends with R
""LEVEL"" – ends with L

""ELVER"" – ends with R

""ALLEY"" – ends with Y
""ALLEY"" – not 5 letters ending E.

""ALLEE"" – 5 letters ending E
- A in 1 (allowed)
- L in 2 (but L can’t be in 2)
Invalid.

""ALOHE"" – not a word
""ALONE"" – A in 1, L in 2 (invalid)

""ALOPE"" – not a word
""ALVER"" – ends with R

""ELANE"" – not a word

""ELAEN"" – not a word

""ELAID"" → this is actually a valid word (a type of water sprite in Scottish folklore) but it’s obscure.

Let’s try ""ELAID"" as it’s the only valid word I can find that fits all constraints:
- Ends with E
- Contains L (in position 2, but feedback only said L is not in position 2, so this is invalid)

Wait, ""ELAID"" has L in position 2, which conflicts with feedback.

Let me think differently: we need a word with A (not in position 3), L (not in position 2), and E in position 5.

Possible structure: _ _ _ _ E

Let’s try ""ALDER"":
- A in 1 (allowed)
- L in 2 (but feedback says L is not in 2) → invalid

""ADLER"":
- A in 1 (allowed)
- D (new)
- L in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (but E must be in 5) → invalid

""ALDER"" already invalid.

""AROSE"" – contains S (invalid)

""ARISE"" – contains S (invalid)

""ALOHE"" – not a word

""ALOPE"" – not a word

""ALVER"" – ends with R

""ALOKE"" – not a word

""ALONE"" – A in 1, L in 2 (invalid)

""ALOGE"" – not a word

""ALMEE"" – not a word

""ALGAE"" – ends with E, has A, L
- A in 3 (but A cannot be in 3) → invalid

""ANGLE"" – ends with E, has A, L
- A in 2 (allowed)
- L in 4 (allowed)
- N (new)
- G (new)
- E in 5 (correct)

This seems valid:
- Contains A and L
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- L is in position 4 (allowed)
- No S or T
- New letters N and G introduced

Let’s try ANGLE.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: ANGLE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(x) G(x) L(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S and T are not in the word.

2. ANGLE → A(-) N(x) G(x) L(-) E(✓)
   - E is still in position 5.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1 (it was marked “-” in position 1).
   - L is in the word but not in position 4 (it was marked “-” in position 4).
   - N and G are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely present: A, L, E (with E locked at position 5).
- Letters definitely absent: S, T, N, G.
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 4.
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains A and L.
- A is in position 2 or 4 (since it can’t be 1 or 3).
- L is in position 1, 3, or 5 (but 5 is already E), so 1 or 3.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible patterns:
- L _ A _ E  (L in 1, A in 3) → but A cannot be in 3.
- _ L A _ E  (L in 2) → but L cannot be in 2.
- _ _ L A E  (L in 3, A in 4) → possible.
- A _ L _ E  (A in 1) → but A cannot be in 1.
- _ A L _ E  (A in 2, L in 3) → possible.

So two viable patterns:
1. _ _ L A E  (L in 3, A in 4)
2. _ A L _ E  (A in 2, L in 3)

Let’s explore the second pattern first: _ A L _ E
We need a consonant in position 1 and a consonant in position 4.
Letters available (excluding S, T, N, G): B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, P, R, W, Y.

Let’s try:
- B A L _ E → BALOE? (not a word)
- C A L _ E → CALVE? (has V, but E is already at 5)
- D A L _ E → DALIE? (not a word)
- F A L _ E → FABLE? (B is allowed, L in 3, A in 2, E in 5) → FABLE is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- Ends with E: yes.
- Contains A, L: yes.
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- L in position 3 (allowed).
- No S, T, N, G: yes.

FABLE seems perfect.

   - A is now confirmed in position 2.
   - B is not in the word.
   - L is in the word but not in position 4 (consistent) and now also not in position 5 (since E is there), so L must be in position 1 or 3.

Combining all constraints:
- Word must be _ A _ _ E (A in 2, E in 5).
- L must be in position 1 or 3.
- Letters definitely absent: S, T, N, G, F, B.
- Remaining possible letters: C, D, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible patterns:
- L A _ _ E (L in 1) → need two consonants in positions 3 and 4.
- _ A L _ E (L in 3) → need consonants in positions 1 and 4.

Let’s explore both:

Pattern 1: L A _ _ E
- LA _ _ E: common words could be LARVE? (no), LAMBE? (no), LANCE? (has N, which is out), LARVE? (no), LARAE? (no), LARDE? (no), LARVE? (no), LARSE? (has S, out), LARTE? (no), LARVE? (no), LARKE? (no), LARLE? (no), LARME? (no), LARPE? (no), LARVE? (no), LARVE? (no), LARVE? (no), LARVE? (no), LARVE? (no), LARVE? (no)... seems no valid word.

Pattern 2: _ A L _ E
- Need consonants in positions 1 and 4.
- Position 1: C, D, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Position 4: same.

Looking for common words:
- C A L _ E → CALVE (has V, but V is allowed), but CALVE is valid.
- D A L _ E → DALIE? (no), DALVE? (no)
- H A L _ E → HALVE (has V, but V is allowed), HALVE is valid.
- M A L _ E → MALVE? (no), MALVE? (no)
- R A L _ E → RALIE? (no), RALVE? (no)
- V A L _ E → VALSE? (has S, out)
- W A L _ E → WALVE? (no)
- Y A L _ E → YALIE? (no)

CALVE and HALVE are both valid. CALVE uses C and V; HALVE uses H and V. Both fit constraints. Let’s pick CALVE first.

Check CALVE:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. A good starting word often includes multiple vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A strong starting word would combine these. 

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - heavy on vowels
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers several common letters and vowels, giving good coverage for the first guess.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S (x) – not in the word at all
- L (-) – in the word but not in position 2
- A (-) – in the word but not in position 3
- T (x) – not in the word at all
- E (✓) – in the word and in position 5

So far we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains L and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.
- It does NOT contain S or T.

We need a word that:
- Ends with E
- Has L somewhere other than position 2
- Has A somewhere other than position 3
- No S or T

Good letters to try next: R, N, I, C, O, U, D, etc.

Let’s try a word that places A and L in new positions while introducing new common letters. A good candidate is ""CRANE"":
- C (new letter)
- R (new letter)
- A (known to be in word, now in position 3 – but feedback said A is not in position 3, so this is bad)
Oops, that’s invalid because A can’t be in position 3.

Next candidate: ""ALONE""
- A (known, now in position 1 – allowed)
- L (known, now in position 2 – but feedback said L is not in position 2, so invalid)

Next: ""RAISE"" – contains S (invalid)
""LAIRE"" – not a common word
""AROSE"" – contains S (invalid)
""CLEAN"" – ends with N, not E
""ELAND"" – ends with D
""LEANT"" – ends with T (invalid)

Better to try ""AROSE"" but it has S. Let’s try ""ARISE"" – again has S.

Alternative: ""ALIEN""
- A in 1 (allowed)
- L in 2 (but feedback said L is not in 2) – invalid

Next: ""ELDER"" – ends with R
""OLDER"" – ends with R
""ALDER"" – ends with R

Let’s try ""ADIEU"" – ends with U
""ADORE"" – ends with E
- A in 1 (allowed)
- D (new)
- O (new)
- R (new)
- E in 5 (correct)

This seems valid:
- Contains A and L? Wait, no L in ADORE – we must include L.

So we need a word with A, L, E, and no S/T. Let’s try ""LAURE"" – but that’s not a common word.

""LAPEL"" – ends with L
""LEPER"" – ends with R
""LEVER"" – ends with R
""LEVEL"" – ends with L

""ELVER"" – ends with R

""ALLEY"" – ends with Y
""ALLEY"" – not 5 letters ending E.

""ALLEE"" – 5 letters ending E
- A in 1 (allowed)
- L in 2 (but L can’t be in 2)
Invalid.

""ALOHE"" – not a word

""ELAID"" → this is actually a valid word (a type of water sprite in Scottish folklore) but it’s obscure.

Let’s try ""ELAID"" as it’s the only valid word I can find that fits all constraints:
- Ends with E
- Contains L (in position 2, but feedback only said L is not in position 2, so this is invalid)

Wait, ""ELAID"" has L in position 2, which conflicts with feedback.

Let me think differently: we need a word with A (not in position 3), L (not in position 2), and E in position 5.

Possible structure: _ _ _ _ E

Let’s try ""ALDER"":
- A in 1 (allowed)
- L in 2 (but feedback says L is not in 2) → invalid

""ADLER"":
- A in 1 (allowed)
- D (new)
- L in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (but E must be in 5) → invalid

""ALDER"" already invalid.

""AROSE"" – contains S (invalid)

""ARISE"" – contains S (invalid)

""ALOHE"" – not a word

""ALOPE"" – not a word

""ALVER"" – ends with R

""ALOKE"" – not a word

""ALONE"" – A in 1, L in 2 (invalid)

""ALOGE"" – not a word

""ALMEE"" – not a word

""ALGAE"" – ends with E, has A, L
- A in 3 (but A cannot be in 3) → invalid

""ANGLE"" – ends with E, has A, L
- A in 2 (allowed)
- L in 4 (allowed)
- N (new)
- G (new)
- E in 5 (correct)

This seems valid:
- Contains A and L
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- L is in position 4 (allowed)
- No S or T
- New letters N and G introduced

Let’s try ANGLE.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: ANGLE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) N(x) G(x) L(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S and T are not in the word.

2. ANGLE → A(-) N(x) G(x) L(-) E(✓)
   - E is still in position 5.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1 (it was marked “-” in position 1).
   - L is in the word but not in position 4 (it was marked “-” in position 4).
   - N and G are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely present: A, L, E (with E locked at position 5).
- Letters definitely absent: S, T, N, G.
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 4.
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains A and L.
- A is in position 2 or 4 (since it can’t be 1 or 3).
- L is in position 1, 3, or 5 (but 5 is already E), so 1 or 3.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible patterns:
- L _ A _ E  (L in 1, A in 3) → but A cannot be in 3.
- _ L A _ E  (L in 2) → but L cannot be in 2.
- _ _ L A E  (L in 3, A in 4) → possible.
- A _ L _ E  (A in 1) → but A cannot be in 1.
- _ A L _ E  (A in 2, L in 3) → possible.

So two viable patterns:
1. _ _ L A E  (L in 3, A in 4)
2. _ A L _ E  (A in 2, L in 3)

Let’s explore the second pattern first: _ A L _ E
We need a consonant in position 1 and a consonant in position 4.
Letters available (excluding S, T, N, G): B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common consonants: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, P, R, W, Y.

Let’s try:
- B A L _ E → BALOE? (not a word)
- C A L _ E → CALVE? (has V, but E is already at 5)
- D A L _ E → DALIE? (not a word)
- F A L _ E → FABLE? (B is allowed, L in 3, A in 2, E in 5) → FABLE is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- Ends with E: yes.
- Contains A, L: yes.
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- L in position 3 (allowed).
- No S, T, N, G: yes.

FABLE seems perfect.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: FABLE -> FEEDBACK: F(x) A(✓) B(x) L(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. ANGLE → A(-) N(x) G(x) L(-) E(✓)
   - E is still in position 5.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L is in the word but not in position 4.
   - N and G are not in the word.

3. FABLE → F(x) A(✓) B(x) L(-) E(✓)
   - E is still in position 5.
   - A is now confirmed in position 2.
   - B is not in the word.
   - L is in the word but not in position 4 (consistent) and now also not in position 5 (since E is there), so L must be in position 1 or 3.

Combining all constraints:
- Word must be _ A _ _ E (A in 2, E in 5).
- L must be in position 1 or 3.
- Letters definitely absent: S, T, N, G, F, B.
- Remaining possible letters: C, D, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible patterns:
- L A _ _ E (L in 1) → need two consonants in positions 3 and 4.
- _ A L _ E (L in 3) → need consonants in positions 1 and 4.

Let’s explore both:

Pattern 1: L A _ _ E
- LA _ _ E: common words could be LARVE? (no), LAMBE? (no), LANCE? (has N, which is out), LARVE? (no), LARAE? (no), LARDE? (no), LARVE? (no), LARSE? (has S, out), LARTE? (no), LARVE? (no), LARKE? (no), LARLE? (no), LARME? (no), LARPE? (no), LARVE? (no), LARVE? (no), LARVE? (no), LARVE? (no), LARVE? (no), LARVE? (no)... seems no valid word.

Pattern 2: _ A L _ E
- Need consonants in positions 1 and 4.
- Position 1: C, D, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Position 4: same.

Looking for common words:
- C A L _ E → CALVE (has V, but V is allowed), but CALVE is valid.
- D A L _ E → DALIE? (no), DALVE? (no)
- H A L _ E → HALVE (has V, but V is allowed), HALVE is valid.
- M A L _ E → MALVE? (no), MALVE? (no)
- R A L _ E → RALIE? (no), RALVE? (no)
- V A L _ E → VALSE? (has S, out)
- W A L _ E → WALVE? (no)
- Y A L _ E → YALIE? (no)

CALVE and HALVE are both valid. CALVE uses C and V; HALVE uses H and V. Both fit constraints. Let’s pick CALVE first.

Check CALVE:
- C (new)
- A (position 2, confirmed)
- L (position 3, allowed)
- V (new)
- E (position 5, confirmed)
- No forbidden letters (S, T, N, G, F, B).

From the four rounds of feedback we now have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

   - E is still in position 5.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L is in the word but not in position 4.
   - N and G are not in the word.

3. FABLE → F(x) A(✓) B(x) L(-) E(✓)
   - E is still in position 5.
   - A is confirmed in position 2.
   - B is not in the word.
   - L is in the word but not in position 4 (consistent) and now also not in position 5 (since E is there), so L must be in position 1 or 3.

4. CALVE → C(x) A(✓) L(✓) V(✓) E(✓)
   - E is still in position 5.
   - A is confirmed in position 2.
   - L is confirmed in position 3.
   - V is in the word and in position 4.
   - C is not in the word.

So the word structure is now fully determined:
- Position 1: any letter except S, T, N, G, F, B, C (from previous eliminations).
- Position 2: A (fixed).
- Position 3: L (fixed).
- Position 4: V (fixed).
- Position 5: E (fixed).

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form _ A L V E.

Looking at common English words ending in ALVE:
- ALONE is invalid (O is allowed, but N is eliminated).
- AVALE? (no)
- BALVE? (B is eliminated)
- CALVE (already tried)
- DALVE? (no)
- HALVE (H is allowed)
- JALVE? (no)
- MALVE? (no)
- PALSE? (S is eliminated)
- RALVE? (no)
- WALVE? (no)
- YALVE? (no)

The only valid remaining word is HALVE.

Check HALVE:
- H (new, allowed)
- A (position 2, correct)
- L (position 3, correct)
- V (position 4, correct)
- E (position 5, correct)
- No forbidden letters.

Therefore, HALVE is the correct word.
