For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 of these common letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E). This will give us maximum information about which of these key letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1
- R is in the word but not in position 2
- O is in the word but not in position 3
- S and E are NOT in the word at all

So the secret word contains A, R, O, but none of S or E.  
We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A, R, O in positions other than 1, 2, 3 respectively.
2. Does not use S or E.
3. Uses two more distinct letters (since we have only 3 confirmed letters).

Let’s look for a word that shifts A, R, O to new positions and adds two common unused letters.  
Good candidates for new letters: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

A word like “TROAK” won’t work (contains S/E).  
“CROAK” is valid, but let’s check positions:  
- C: new letter, position 1 – allowed  
- R: position 2 – but feedback said R is NOT in position 2 → conflict  
So “CROAK” is invalid.

Next try: “TROOP” – has O twice, but we already know O is in the word once (since it appeared once in AROSE feedback).  
“CROWN” – uses C, R, O, W, N.  
Check positions:  
- C (new, pos 1) – ok  
- R (pos 2) – conflict (R not in pos 2) – invalid  

Try “CORAL” – C, O, R, A, L  
Positions:  
- C (new, pos 1) – ok  
- O (pos 2) – allowed (original O was in pos 3)  
- R (pos 3) – allowed (original R was in pos 2)  
- A (pos 4) – allowed (original A was in pos 1)  
- L (new, pos 5) – ok  

No conflicts, and it uses two new letters (C, L).

- R is in the word, but not in position 3.
- A is in the word, but not in position 4.
- L is NOT in the word.

Summary of what we know:
- Letters confirmed in the word: A, R, O (each appears once).
- Letters confirmed NOT in the word: S, E, C, L.
- Position constraints:
  - A ≠ 1 and A ≠ 4
  - R ≠ 2 and R ≠ 3
  - O ≠ 2 and O ≠ 3

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains exactly the letters A, R, O plus two new letters (not S, E, C, L).
2. Respects the position restrictions above.

Good remaining letters to try: D, N, T, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

Let’s look for a word that places A, R, O in allowable positions and adds two new common letters.

Possible structure: _ _ _ _ _

We need to place A, R, O in positions where they are allowed:
- A can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- R can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
- O can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- If we place R in position 1, then:
  - A can be in 2, 3, or 5.
  - O can be in 4 or 5 (but not 2,3).
  - Let’s try R A _ O _ : but A is in position 2 (allowed), O in 4 (allowed). We need two new letters.
  - Example: R A D O N → check positions: R(1), A(2), D(3), O(4), N(5).
    - A is not in 4 or 1 – ok (it’s in 2).
    - R is not in 2 or 3 – ok (it’s in 1).
    - O is not in 2 or 3 – ok (it’s in 4).
    - Letters used: R, A, D, O, N – all allowed, no forbidden letters.

Let’s look for a word that shifts A, R, O to new positions and adds two common unused letters.  
Good candidates for new letters: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

A word like “TROAK” won’t work (contains S/E).  
“CROAK” is valid, but let’s check positions:  
- C: new letter, position 1 – allowed  
- R: position 2 – but feedback said R is NOT in position 2 → conflict  
So “CROAK” is invalid.

Next try: “TROOP” – has O twice, but we already know O is in the word once (since it appeared once in AROSE feedback).  
“CROWN” – uses C, R, O, W, N.  
Check positions:  
- C (new, pos 1) – ok  
- R (pos 2) – conflict (R not in pos 2) – invalid  

Try “CORAL” – C, O, R, A, L  
Positions:  
- C (new, pos 1) – ok  
- O (pos 2) – allowed (original O was in pos 3)  
- R (pos 3) – allowed (original R was in pos 2)  
- A (pos 4) – allowed (original A was in pos 1)  
- L (new, pos 5) – ok

We need a 5-letter word that:

2. Respects the position restrictions above.

Let’s look for a word that places A, R, O in allowable positions and adds two new common letters.

Possible structure: _ _ _ _ _

We need to place A, R, O in positions where they are allowed:

Let’s try to construct a word:
- If we place R in position 1, then:
  - A can be in 2, 3, or 5.
  - O can be in 4 or 5 (but not 2,3).
  - Let’s try R A _ O _ : but A is in position 2 (allowed), O in 4 (allowed). We need two new letters.

Let’s update the constraints after the third guess (RADON):

- R is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- D is NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- N is NOT in the word.

Combining all information so far:
Letters confirmed in the word: A, R, O (each once).
Letters confirmed NOT in the word: S, E, C, L, D, N.
Positions we now know:
- A ≠ 1, 2, 4
- R ≠ 1, 2, 3
- O ≠ 2, 3, 4

Therefore:
- A must be in position 3 or 5.
- R must be in position 4 or 5.
- O must be in position 1 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that uses exactly A, R, O plus two new letters (from the remaining alphabet, excluding S, E, C, L, D, N). Remaining common letters include B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies the positional constraints and introduces two new letters.

Option 1: Place A in position 3.
Then:
- R must be in 4 or 5.
- O must be in 1 or 5 (but 5 might be taken by R, so O in 1).
Word structure: O _ A R _ → need one more letter.
Example: O B A R K → check letters: O, B, A, R, K – all allowed, positions:
- A in 3 (allowed), R in 4 (allowed), O in 1 (allowed).
- New letters: B, K.
- OABAR is not a valid word, but OBRAG is not valid either. Let’s think of real words.

Option 2: Place A in position 5.
Then:
- R must be in 4 (since 5 is taken by A).
- O must be in 1 (since 2,3,4 are constrained).
Word structure: O _ _ R A → need one more letter in position 2 or 3.
Example: O B A R A – invalid (A twice).
O B _ R A – need a letter in position 3 that is not A, S, E, C, L, D, N.
Possible: O B I R A → check:
- Letters: O, B, I, R, A – all allowed.
- Positions:
  - A in 5 (allowed), R in 4 (allowed), O in 1 (allowed).
  - B and I are new letters.
  - ""OBIRA"" is not a valid English word.

Option 3: Try O in position 5.
Then:
- R must be in 4 (since it can’t be 1,2,3).
- A must be in 3 (since it can’t be 1,2,4,5).
Word structure: _ _ A R O → need two new letters in positions 1 and 2.
Example: T I A R O → check:
- Letters: T, I, A, R, O – all allowed.
- Positions:
  - A in 3 (allowed), R in 4 (allowed), O in 5 (allowed).

From Guess 4 (TIARO):
- T is NOT in the word.
- I is NOT in the word.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the word structure is: _ _ A R _

Letters confirmed in the word: A, R, O (each once).
Letters confirmed NOT in the word: S, E, C, L, D, N, T, I.

Positions we now know:
- A is in position 3 (fixed).
- R is in position 4 (fixed).
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (from earlier constraints) – wait, that can’t be right.

Let me re-examine the constraints after all guesses:

From all feedback:
- A is in position 3 (from TIARO feedback: A(✓)).
- R is in position 4 (from TIARO feedback: R(✓)).
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (because earlier it was not in 2,3,4 and now it’s not in 5). This leaves only position 1 for O.

Therefore, the word must be: O _ A R _

We need a 5-letter word that starts with O, has A in position 3 and R in position 4, and introduces two new letters (positions 2 and 5) from the remaining alphabet (excluding S, E, C, L, D, N, T, I).

Remaining common letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible candidates:
- O B A R B – invalid (B twice).
- O B A R G – ""OBARG"" is not a word.
- O B A R K – ""OBARK"" is not a word.
- O B A R M – ""OBARM"" is not a word.
- O B A R P – ""OBARP"" is not a word.
- O G A R M – ""OGARM"" is not a word.
- O P A R K – ""OPARK"" is not a word.
- O M A R K – ""OMARK"" is not a word.
- O P A R M – ""OPARM"" is not a word.
- O M A R B – ""OMARB"" is not a word.

Wait, let me think of real words that fit O _ A R _.

Real words:
- O B A R K – no.
- O B A R G – no.
- O M A R K – no.
- O B A R M – no.

Actually, ""OBOR"" is 4 letters. Let me think differently: position 5 must be a letter not yet ruled out.

Looking at remaining letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 of these common letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E). This will give us maximum information about which of these key letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1
- R is in the word but not in position 2
- O is in the word but not in position 3
- S and E are NOT in the word at all

So the secret word contains A, R, O, but none of S or E.  
We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A, R, O in positions other than 1, 2, 3 respectively.
2. Does not use S or E.
3. Uses two more distinct letters (since we have only 3 confirmed letters).

Let’s look for a word that shifts A, R, O to new positions and adds two common unused letters.  
Good candidates for new letters: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

A word like “TROAK” won’t work (contains S/E).  
“CROAK” is valid, but let’s check positions:  
- C: new letter, position 1 – allowed  
- R: position 2 – but feedback said R is NOT in position 2 → conflict  
So “CROAK” is invalid.

Next try: “TROOP” – has O twice, but we already know O is in the word once (since it appeared once in AROSE feedback).  
“CROWN” – uses C, R, O, W, N.  
Check positions:  
- C (new, pos 1) – ok  
- R (pos 2) – conflict (R not in pos 2) – invalid  

Try “CORAL” – C, O, R, A, L  
Positions:  
- C (new, pos 1) – ok  
- O (pos 2) – allowed (original O was in pos 3)  
- R (pos 3) – allowed (original R was in pos 2)  
- A (pos 4) – allowed (original A was in pos 1)  
- L (new, pos 5) – ok  

No conflicts, and it uses two new letters (C, L).  
“CORAL” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let's consolidate the information we have so far.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A is in the word, but not in position 1.
- R is in the word, but not in position 2.
- O is in the word, but not in position 3.
- S and E are NOT in the word.

From Guess 2 (CORAL):
- C is NOT in the word.
- O is in the word, but not in position 2.
- R is in the word, but not in position 3.
- A is in the word, but not in position 4.
- L is NOT in the word.

Summary of what we know:
- Letters confirmed in the word: A, R, O (each appears once).
- Letters confirmed NOT in the word: S, E, C, L.
- Position constraints:
  - A ≠ 1 and A ≠ 4
  - R ≠ 2 and R ≠ 3
  - O ≠ 2 and O ≠ 3

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains exactly the letters A, R, O plus two new letters (not S, E, C, L).
2. Respects the position restrictions above.

Good remaining letters to try: D, N, T, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

Let’s look for a word that places A, R, O in allowable positions and adds two new common letters.

Possible structure: _ _ _ _ _

We need to place A, R, O in positions where they are allowed:
- A can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- R can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
- O can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- If we place R in position 1, then:
  - A can be in 2, 3, or 5.
  - O can be in 4 or 5 (but not 2,3).
  - Let’s try R A _ O _ : but A is in position 2 (allowed), O in 4 (allowed). We need two new letters.
  - Example: R A D O N → check positions: R(1), A(2), D(3), O(4), N(5).
    - A is not in 4 or 1 – ok (it’s in 2).
    - R is not in 2 or 3 – ok (it’s in 1).
    - O is not in 2 or 3 – ok (it’s in 4).
    - Letters used: R, A, D, O, N – all allowed, no forbidden letters.
    - RADON is a valid word.

This seems like a strong next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CORAL -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(-) R(-) A(-) L(x)
Guess 3: RADON -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) D(x) O(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s update the constraints after the third guess (RADON):

From Guess 3 (RADON):
- R is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- D is NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- N is NOT in the word.

Combining all information so far:
Letters confirmed in the word: A, R, O (each once).
Letters confirmed NOT in the word: S, E, C, L, D, N.
Positions we now know:
- A ≠ 1, 2, 4
- R ≠ 1, 2, 3
- O ≠ 2, 3, 4

Therefore:
- A must be in position 3 or 5.
- R must be in position 4 or 5.
- O must be in position 1 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that uses exactly A, R, O plus two new letters (from the remaining alphabet, excluding S, E, C, L, D, N). Remaining common letters include B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies the positional constraints and introduces two new letters.

Option 1: Place A in position 3.
Then:
- R must be in 4 or 5.
- O must be in 1 or 5 (but 5 might be taken by R, so O in 1).
Word structure: O _ A R _ → need one more letter.
Example: O B A R K → check letters: O, B, A, R, K – all allowed, positions:
- A in 3 (allowed), R in 4 (allowed), O in 1 (allowed).
- New letters: B, K.
- OABAR is not a valid word, but OBRAG is not valid either. Let’s think of real words.

Option 2: Place A in position 5.
Then:
- R must be in 4 (since 5 is taken by A).
- O must be in 1 (since 2,3,4 are constrained).
Word structure: O _ _ R A → need one more letter in position 2 or 3.
Example: O B A R A – invalid (A twice).
O B _ R A – need a letter in position 3 that is not A, S, E, C, L, D, N.
Possible: O B I R A → check:
- Letters: O, B, I, R, A – all allowed.
- Positions:
  - A in 5 (allowed), R in 4 (allowed), O in 1 (allowed).
  - B and I are new letters.
  - ""OBIRA"" is not a valid English word.

Option 3: Try O in position 5.
Then:
- R must be in 4 (since it can’t be 1,2,3).
- A must be in 3 (since it can’t be 1,2,4,5).
Word structure: _ _ A R O → need two new letters in positions 1 and 2.
Example: T I A R O → check:
- Letters: T, I, A, R, O – all allowed.
- Positions:
  - A in 3 (allowed), R in 4 (allowed), O in 5 (allowed).
  - T and I are new letters.
  - ""TIARO"" is a valid word (a type of jewelry).

This seems like the best next guess.

From the feedback so far we know:

- Letters that are in the word and their positions:
  – A is in position 3 (✓)
  – R is in position 4 (✓)
- Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
  – O (it has appeared in guesses 1, 2, 3, 4 but never in the correct position; the only position it has not been tried is position 5)
- Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
  – S, E, C, L, D, N, T, I

So the word looks like: _ _ A R _

We still need to place O somewhere, and the only spot left where O has not been tried is position 5. Therefore O must be in position 5.

Now we need two more distinct letters for positions 1 and 2. These letters must not be any of the eliminated ones (S, E, C, L, D, N, T, I) and must not repeat A, R, or O.

Remaining common letters include: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s pick two new letters from these and form a valid 5-letter word ending in AR_O.

A good candidate is “MARRY” but that repeats R and Y isn’t great. Instead, let’s try “BARFS” but S is eliminated. How about “GARBO”? G, A, R, B, O – all allowed and positions fit: G(1) A(3) R(4) B(2) O(5).

“GARBO” is a valid English word (short for “garbage man” or a variant spelling).

Let’s check:
- G: new letter, position 1 – allowed
- A: position 3 (✓)
- R: position 4 (✓)
- B: new letter, position 2 – allowed
- O: position 5 (never tried there before, and constraints say it must be there)

This seems correct.
