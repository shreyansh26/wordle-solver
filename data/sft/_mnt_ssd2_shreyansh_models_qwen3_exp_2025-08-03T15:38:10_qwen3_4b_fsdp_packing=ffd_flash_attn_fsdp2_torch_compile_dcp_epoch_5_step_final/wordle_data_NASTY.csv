Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word often includes vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)

This combination gives us good coverage to gather information about which letters might be in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1
- L is not in the word at all
- A is in the word but not in position 3
- T is in the word and in position 4
- E is not in the word

So we know:
- The word has T in position 4
- It contains S and A, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively
- It does NOT contain L or E

We need a word that:
- Has T in the 4th spot
- Has S somewhere except first position
- Has A somewhere except third position
- Avoids L and E

Possible candidates might include:
- CRASH (but has H, not sure)
- STAND (but T is in 4th, but S is in 1st which we know is wrong)
- SATIN (but T is 4th, A is 1st, S is 2nd - this seems possible)
- PATIO (but has O, not sure)
- CARTS (but T is 4th, S is 5th - possible)

Looking at SATIN:
- S is in position 2 (allowed)
- A is in position 1 (allowed)
- T is in position 4 (matches)
- Doesn't contain L or E
- Contains I and N which are new letters to test

This seems like a good next guess to test A and S in new positions and introduce new consonants.

Let's digest the new feedback from SATIN:

S(-)  → S is in the word but not in position 1  
A(✓)  → A is in the word and is in position 2  
T(-)  → T is in the word but not in position 3  
I(x)  → I is NOT in the word  
N(-)  → N is in the word but not in position 5  

Current certainties:
- Position 2 = A  
- The word contains S, T, N (each somewhere else than their SATIN positions)  
- The word does NOT contain L, E, I  

The word must be of the form: _ A _ _ _

Constraints on the remaining letters:
- S cannot be in position 1, so it must be in 3, 4, or 5.  
- T cannot be in position 3, so it must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5. But position 2 is already A, so T must be in 1, 4, or 5.  
- N cannot be in position 5, so it must be in 1, 3, or 4.  

Let's try to place these letters:

Option 1: T in position 1
Then word looks like: T A _ _ _
S must go in 3, 4, or 5  
N must go in 3 or 4 (since 5 is excluded for N)  
Possible combinations:
- T A S N _ → need one more letter (but we've used T, A, S, N; the last letter must be new and not L, E, I)  
- T A N S _ → same issue  
- T A _ N S → possible, but need to check if valid word  

Option 2: T in position 4
Then word looks like: _ A T _ _
S must be in 3 or 5 (cannot be 1 because S(-) means not position 1)  
N must be in 1 or 3 (cannot be 5)  
Possible combinations:
- N A T S _ → need last letter  
- S A T N _ → but T is in 4, so this would be _ A T _ _  
Wait, let's list valid patterns:
- _ A T S N → but N cannot be in 5  
- _ A T N S → N is in 4, S in 5 → valid  
- N A T _ S → but T is in 3 which is invalid (T(-) means not position 3)  

Option 3: T in position 5
Then word looks like: _ A _ _ T
S must be in 3 or 4 (cannot be 1)  
N must be in 1, 3, or 4  
Possible combinations:
- N A S _ T → but need 4th letter  
- S A N _ T → but N is in 3, S in 2 (but 2 is A) no  
- _ A S N T → but N is in 4, T in 5 → valid  
- _ A N S T → N in 3, S in 4 → valid  

Let's try _ A N S T → need first letter (not L, E, I)  
Possible first letters: consonants except L, E, I  
Let's think of valid words:

Looking at _ A N S T → possible words:
- BANST (not a valid word)  
- CANST (archaic, not common)  
- FANST (not valid)  
- GANST (not valid)  

Instead, let's try _ A T N S → T in 4, N in 3, S in 5  
Need first letter: not L, E, I  
Possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Looking for valid words:
- BATNS (no)  
- CATNS (no)  
- HATNS (no)  
- NATS_ (but T is in 4)  

Wait, let's try N A T S _ → but T is in 3 which is invalid  

Let me re-examine possible valid words with constraints:

We know:
- Position 2 = A  
- Must contain S, T, N  
- S not in 1, T not in 3, N not in 5  

Let's list possible positions:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   ? A ? ? ?  

S must be in 3,4,5  
T must be in 1,4,5  
N must be in 1,3,4  

Let's try T in 1, N in 3, S in 4  
→ T A N S _ → need 5th letter (not L,E,I)  
Possible: TANSE (but E is invalid)  
TANST (double T)  
TANSH (valid word: TANSH? no)  
Actually, TANST is not a word, and TANS is a word but needs a 5th letter.  

Let's try T in 1, S in 5, N in 3  
→ T A N _ S → need 4th letter  
Possible: TANGS (G is allowed) → TANGS is a valid word meaning ""to tan (hide)""  

Check constraints:
- T in 1: allowed (T(-) only said not in 3)  
- A in 2: correct  
- N in 3: allowed (not in 5)  
- S in 5: allowed (not in 1)  
- No L, E, I: correct  

TANGS seems valid.  

Another possibility: T in 4, N in 1, S in 5  
→ N A _ T S → need 3rd letter  
Possible: NATSH (no), NATBS (no)  

Another: T in 4, N in 1, S in 3  
→ N A S T _ → need 5th letter  
Possible: NASIT (no), NASCT (no)  

Another: T in 5, N in 1, S in 3 or 4  
→ N A S _ T → need 4th letter  
Possible: NASAT (no), NASBT (no)  

→ N A _ S T → need 3rd letter  
Possible: NABST (no), NACST (no)  

Let me check TANGS: it's a valid word (British English variant spelling of ""tongs""), and fits all constraints.  

Therefore, TANGS is a good next guess.

Possible: TANSE (but E is invalid)  
TANST (double T)  
TANSH (valid word: TANSH? no)  
Actually, TANST is not a word, and TANS is a word but needs a 5th letter.  

Let's try T in 1, S in 5, N in 3  
→ T A N _ S → need 4th letter  
Possible: TANGS (G is allowed) → TANGS is a valid word meaning ""to tan (hide)""  

Check constraints:
- T in 1: allowed (T(-) only said not in 3)  
- A in 2: correct  
- N in 3: allowed (not in 5)  
- S in 5: allowed (not in 1)  
- No L, E, I: correct  

TANGS seems valid.  

Another possibility: T in 4, N in 1, S in 5  
→ N A _ T S → need 3rd letter  
Possible: NATSH (no), NATBS (no)  

Another: T in 4, N in 1, S in 3  
→ N A S T _ → need 5th letter  
Possible: NASIT (no), NASCT (no)  

Another: T in 5, N in 1, S in 3 or 4  
→ N A S _ T → need 4th letter  
Possible: NASAT (no), NASBT (no)  

→ N A _ S T → need 3rd letter  
Possible: NABST (no), NACST (no)  

Let me check TANGS: it's a valid word (British English variant spelling of ""tongs""), and fits all constraints.  

Therefore, TANGS is a good next guess.",Guess 3: TANGS -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(✓) N(-) G(x) S(-),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word often includes vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)

This combination gives us good coverage to gather information about which letters might be in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1
- L is not in the word at all
- A is in the word but not in position 3
- T is in the word and in position 4
- E is not in the word

So we know:
- The word has T in position 4
- It contains S and A, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively
- It does NOT contain L or E

We need a word that:
- Has T in the 4th spot
- Has S somewhere except first position
- Has A somewhere except third position
- Avoids L and E

Possible candidates might include:
- CRASH (but has H, not sure)
- STAND (but T is in 4th, but S is in 1st which we know is wrong)
- SATIN (but T is 4th, A is 1st, S is 2nd - this seems possible)
- PATIO (but has O, not sure)
- CARTS (but T is 4th, S is 5th - possible)

Looking at SATIN:
- S is in position 2 (allowed)
- A is in position 1 (allowed)
- T is in position 4 (matches)
- Doesn't contain L or E
- Contains I and N which are new letters to test

This seems like a good next guess to test A and S in new positions and introduce new consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: SATIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) A(✓) T(-) I(x) N(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's digest the new feedback from SATIN:

S(-)  → S is in the word but not in position 1  
A(✓)  → A is in the word and is in position 2  
T(-)  → T is in the word but not in position 3  
I(x)  → I is NOT in the word  
N(-)  → N is in the word but not in position 5  

Current certainties:
- Position 2 = A  
- The word contains S, T, N (each somewhere else than their SATIN positions)  
- The word does NOT contain L, E, I  

The word must be of the form: _ A _ _ _

Constraints on the remaining letters:
- S cannot be in position 1, so it must be in 3, 4, or 5.  
- T cannot be in position 3, so it must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5. But position 2 is already A, so T must be in 1, 4, or 5.  
- N cannot be in position 5, so it must be in 1, 3, or 4.  

Let's try to place these letters:

Option 1: T in position 1
Then word looks like: T A _ _ _
S must go in 3, 4, or 5  
N must go in 3 or 4 (since 5 is excluded for N)  
Possible combinations:
- T A S N _ → need one more letter (but we've used T, A, S, N; the last letter must be new and not L, E, I)  
- T A N S _ → same issue  
- T A _ N S → possible, but need to check if valid word  

Option 2: T in position 4
Then word looks like: _ A T _ _
S must be in 3 or 5 (cannot be 1 because S(-) means not position 1)  
N must be in 1 or 3 (cannot be 5)  
Possible combinations:
- N A T S _ → need last letter  
- S A T N _ → but T is in 4, so this would be _ A T _ _  
Wait, let's list valid patterns:
- _ A T S N → but N cannot be in 5  
- _ A T N S → N is in 4, S in 5 → valid  
- N A T _ S → but T is in 3 which is invalid (T(-) means not position 3)  

Option 3: T in position 5
Then word looks like: _ A _ _ T
S must be in 3 or 4 (cannot be 1)  
N must be in 1, 3, or 4  
Possible combinations:
- N A S _ T → but need 4th letter  
- S A N _ T → but N is in 3, S in 2 (but 2 is A) no  
- _ A S N T → but N is in 4, T in 5 → valid  
- _ A N S T → N in 3, S in 4 → valid  

Let's try _ A N S T → need first letter (not L, E, I)  
Possible first letters: consonants except L, E, I  
Let's think of valid words:

Looking at _ A N S T → possible words:
- BANST (not a valid word)  
- CANST (archaic, not common)  
- FANST (not valid)  
- GANST (not valid)  

Instead, let's try _ A T N S → T in 4, N in 3, S in 5  
Need first letter: not L, E, I  
Possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Looking for valid words:
- BATNS (no)  
- CATNS (no)  
- HATNS (no)  
- NATS_ (but T is in 4)  

Wait, let's try N A T S _ → but T is in 3 which is invalid  

Let me re-examine possible valid words with constraints:

We know:
- Position 2 = A  
- Must contain S, T, N  
- S not in 1, T not in 3, N not in 5  

Let's list possible positions:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Letters:   ? A ? ? ?  

S must be in 3,4,5  
T must be in 1,4,5  
N must be in 1,3,4  

Let's try T in 1, N in 3, S in 4  
→ T A N S _ → need 5th letter (not L,E,I)  
Possible: TANSE (but E is invalid)  
TANST (double T)  
TANSH (valid word: TANSH? no)  
Actually, TANST is not a word, and TANS is a word but needs a 5th letter.  

Let's try T in 1, S in 5, N in 3  
→ T A N _ S → need 4th letter  
Possible: TANGS (G is allowed) → TANGS is a valid word meaning ""to tan (hide)""  

Check constraints:
- T in 1: allowed (T(-) only said not in 3)  
- A in 2: correct  
- N in 3: allowed (not in 5)  
- S in 5: allowed (not in 1)  
- No L, E, I: correct  

TANGS seems valid.  

Another possibility: T in 4, N in 1, S in 5  
→ N A _ T S → need 3rd letter  
Possible: NATSH (no), NATBS (no)  

Another: T in 4, N in 1, S in 3  
→ N A S T _ → need 5th letter  
Possible: NASIT (no), NASCT (no)  

Another: T in 5, N in 1, S in 3 or 4  
→ N A S _ T → need 4th letter  
Possible: NASAT (no), NASBT (no)  

→ N A _ S T → need 3rd letter  
Possible: NABST (no), NACST (no)  

Let me check TANGS: it's a valid word (British English variant spelling of ""tongs""), and fits all constraints.  

Therefore, TANGS is a good next guess.

Let's consolidate all the information we have so far.

Known facts:
1. Position 2 = A (from SATIN and TANGS both showing A(✓))
2. The word contains S, T, N (each has been marked “-” so they are in the word but not in the positions tried yet).
3. Letters NOT in the word: L, E, I, G
4. Position constraints after all guesses:
   - S cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (because it was “-” in positions 1, 3, 5 in SLATE, SATIN, TANGS respectively).  
     Therefore S must be in position 2. But position 2 is already A.  
     This is impossible, so my deduction must be wrong.

Wait, let’s re-examine the “-” feedback carefully:
- SLATE: S(-) → S not in position 1  
- SATIN: S(-) → S not in position 1 (same info)  
- TANGS: S(-) → S not in position 5  

So S cannot be in positions 1 or 5. It could be 2, 3, or 4.  
But position 2 is A, so S must be in 3 or 4.

Similarly for T:
- SLATE: T(✓) position 4  
- SATIN: T(-) → T not in position 3  
- TANGS: T(-) → T not in position 1  

So T is in position 4 (from SLATE), but SATIN and TANGS only told us it’s not in 3 or 1.  
Therefore T must be in position 4 (confirmed by SLATE) and we don’t have new info.

For N:
- SATIN: N(-) → N not in position 5  
- TANGS: N(-) → N not in position 3  

So N must be in 1, 2, or 4.  
But position 2 is A, and T is in position 4, so N must be in position 1.

So far the pattern is:
1: N  
2: A  
4: T  
and positions 3 and 5 are still open.

Letters known to be in the word: N, A, T, S  
Letters known NOT in the word: L, E, I, G  

We still need to place S (must be in 3 or 5) and determine the fifth letter.

Possible words:
- N A S T _ → need 5th letter (not L,E,I,G)  
- N A _ T S → need 3rd letter (not L,E,I,G)  

Let’s list valid English words that fit these patterns.

1. NAS_T:  
   Possible 5th letters (not L,E,I,G): B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
   Valid words: NASHT (no), NASTE (E invalid), NASUT (no), NASTY (Y is allowed)  
   NASTY is a valid word.

2. N_A_TS:  
   Possible 3rd letters: same set  
   Valid words: NUTTS (no), NUTTS (no), NABTS (no), NACTS (no), NAPTS (no), NARMS (no) – nothing obvious.

So the only valid candidate fitting all constraints is NASTY.

Check constraints:
- N in 1: allowed (not 3 or 5)  
- A in 2: correct  
- S in 5: allowed (not 1 or 5? Wait, S cannot be in 1 or 5, so S in 5 is invalid.)  

Oh no – S cannot be in 5 (from TANGS feedback: S(-) means not in 5).  
Therefore S must be in 3, making the pattern N A S T _ → need 5th letter.

Valid words:  
N A S T _ → possible 5th letters (not L,E,I,G): B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Valid English words:  
- NASHT (no)  
- NASTE (E invalid)  
- NASUT (no)  
- NASTY (Y is allowed) – but this would be N A S T Y, which is 5 letters.

Wait, N A S T Y is 5 letters and valid. Let me verify:  
N A S T Y – yes, NASTY is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- N in 1: allowed  
- A in 2: correct  
- S in 3: allowed (not 1 or 5)  
- T in 4: correct (from SLATE)  
- Y is not in forbidden set {L,E,I,G}  

Therefore the next guess should be NASTY.

and positions 3 and 5 are still open.

Letters known to be in the word: N, A, T, S  
Letters known NOT in the word: L, E, I, G  

We still need to place S (must be in 3 or 5) and determine the fifth letter.

Possible words:
- N A S T _ → need 5th letter (not L,E,I,G)  
- N A _ T S → need 3rd letter (not L,E,I,G)  

Let’s list valid English words that fit these patterns.

1. NAS_T:  
   Possible 5th letters (not L,E,I,G): B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
   Valid words: NASHT (no), NASTE (E invalid), NASUT (no), NASTY (Y is allowed)  
   NASTY is a valid word.

2. N_A_TS:  
   Possible 3rd letters: same set  
   Valid words: NUTTS (no), NUTTS (no), NABTS (no), NACTS (no), NAPTS (no), NARMS (no) – nothing obvious.

So the only valid candidate fitting all constraints is NASTY.

Check constraints:
- N in 1: allowed (not 3 or 5)  
- A in 2: correct  
- S in 5: allowed (not 1 or 5? Wait, S cannot be in 1 or 5, so S in 5 is invalid.)  

Oh no – S cannot be in 5 (from TANGS feedback: S(-) means not in 5).  
Therefore S must be in 3, making the pattern N A S T _ → need 5th letter.

Valid words:  
N A S T _ → possible 5th letters (not L,E,I,G): B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Valid English words:  
- NASHT (no)  
- NASTE (E invalid)  
- NASUT (no)  
- NASTY (Y is allowed) – but this would be N A S T Y, which is 5 letters.

Wait, N A S T Y is 5 letters and valid. Let me verify:  
N A S T Y – yes, NASTY is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- N in 1: allowed  
- A in 2: correct  
- S in 3: allowed (not 1 or 5)  
- T in 4: correct (from SLATE)  
- Y is not in forbidden set {L,E,I,G}  

Therefore the next guess should be NASTY.",Guess 4: NASTY -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
