For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it cannot be in slot 1).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, but not in the first position.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has an A somewhere in positions 2-5.
- Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.

Good consonants to try next are T, N, L, C, D, etc.  
I’ll pick a word that uses A in a different position and introduces new common letters.

A good candidate is “PLANT”:
- P, L, N, T are new letters.
- A is in position 3 (not position 1, satisfying the feedback).

Remaining common consonants we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.
We need a 5-letter word that uses A and L in permissible positions and only the allowed letters.

Good candidates:
- CABLE: C, A, B, L, E → but E is forbidden.
- GALAX: G, A, L, A, X → X is uncommon and only one A is confirmed.
- DALLY: D, A, L, L, Y → double L is possible, Y is allowed.
- MURAL: M, U, R, A, L → R is forbidden.

From the new feedback on WALLY:

- W(x) → W is NOT in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in position 2 and is correct.
- L(-) → L is in the word but not in position 3.
- L(✓) → L is in position 4 and is correct.
- Y(✓) → Y is in position 5 and is correct.

So the secret word looks like: _ A _ L Y

Known letters and positions:
- Position 2: A
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: Y

Letters confirmed NOT in the word (from all feedback):
R, O, S, E, P, N, T, W

We need to find the first and third letters. Allowed letters are those not yet ruled out. Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, etc.

Possible first letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V
Possible third letters: same list (but not L, A, Y)

Let's think of common 5-letter words ending in ""ALY"":
- BALLY → B is allowed, but we need to check if B is allowed (it isn't ruled out yet)
- FALLY → F is allowed
- GALLY → G is allowed
- HALLY → H is allowed
- KALLY → K is allowed
- MALLY → M is allowed
- VALLY → V is allowed

But ""BALLY"" is a valid word meaning a type of dance or a name, and B hasn't been ruled out. However, we need to check if this fits all constraints:
- B (position 1): allowed
- A (position 2): correct
- L (position 3): but feedback says L is not in position 3 (it's in position 4), so this would be correct because L is in position 4 here, not 3. Wait, the word is B A L L Y, so position 3 is L, but feedback says L is in the word but not in position 3. This would be a conflict because in BALLY, L appears in position 3, which is invalid.

So ""BALLY"" is invalid because L is in position 3.

Looking at other options:
- FALLY: F A L L Y → same issue, L is in position 3.
- GALLY: G A L L Y → L in position 3.
- HALLY: H A L L Y → L in position 3.
- KALLY: K A L L Y → L in position 3.
- MALLY: M A L L Y → L in position 3.
- VALLY: V A L L Y → L in position 3.

All these have L in position 3, which is invalid. Therefore, the third letter cannot be L, and the word must be _ A _ L Y with the first letter and third letter different.

Looking for words like _ A _ L Y:
- CABLE → E is forbidden.
- DALLY → L in position 3 (invalid).
- FABLE → E is forbidden.
- GABLE → E is forbidden.
- HABIT → T is forbidden.
- MABLE → E is forbidden.
- VABLE → E is forbidden.
- CABLY → not a valid word.
- DABLY → not valid.
- FABLY → not valid.
- GABLY → not valid.
- HABLY → not valid.
- MABLY → not valid.
- VABLY → not valid.

Wait, maybe the third letter is not a consonant but another vowel, but we've already used A and Y, and O, E, I are possible but O and E are forbidden. So possible vowels left: I, U.

Let's try:
- F A I L Y → FAI LY is ""FAILY"" which is not a word.
- F A U L Y → FAULY is not a word.
- M A I L Y → MAILY is not a word.
- M A U L Y → MAULY is not a word.
- C A I L Y → CAI LY is not a word.
- C A U L Y → CAULY is not a word.
- H A I L Y → HAILY is not a word.
- H A U L Y → HAULY is not a word.
- V A I L Y → VAILY is not a word.
- V A U L Y → VAULY is not a word.

Hmm, maybe the word is ""CABLE"" but E is forbidden. Let me think differently.

Actually, the word must be _ A _ L Y with first letter and third letter from remaining allowed letters. Let me list possible first and third letters:

First letter: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V
Third letter: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, I, U

Wait, I'm not finding any valid words. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of actual words ending in ""ALY"" with A in position 2 and L in position 4, Y in position 5.

Possible words:
- ""CABLE"" → E is forbidden.

- ""FABLE"" → E is forbidden.
- ""GABLE"" → E is forbidden.

- ""VALLY"" → L is in position 3 (invalid).

Actually, the correct word must be _ A _ L Y with the first letter and third letter from remaining allowed letters. The only valid word I can think of is ""CABLE"" but E is forbidden. 

Wait, let me check ""BALLY"" again - but L is in position 3 which is invalid. 

I realize now that the word must be ""CABLE"" but E is forbidden, so this suggests I might have made an error in previous steps. Let me re-examine:

From WALLY feedback:
- A is in position 2 (correct)
- L is in position 4 (correct)
- Y is in position 5 (correct)
- L is in the word but not in position 3 (so the other L must be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 cannot be L because L is in position 4, so position 3 must be another letter)

This implies the word is _ A _ L Y with no second L. So possible words:

I realize now that the correct word must be ""BADLY"" - but I didn't consider that. Let me check:
- B (position 1): allowed
- A (position 2): correct
- D (position 3): allowed
- L (position 4): correct
- Y (position 5): correct

And ""BADLY"" is a valid word meaning in a bad way. This fits all constraints:
- Contains A (position 2), L (position 4), Y (position 5)
- Does not contain any forbidden letters (R, O, S, E, P, N, T, W)
- L is not in position 3 (it's in 4), so this satisfies the feedback.

Therefore, the next guess should be BADLY.

I realize now that the correct word must be ""BADLY"" - but I didn't consider that. Let me check:
- B (position 1): allowed
- A (position 2): correct
- D (position 3): allowed
- L (position 4): correct
- Y (position 5): correct

And ""BADLY"" is a valid word meaning in a bad way. This fits all constraints:
- Contains A (position 2), L (position 4), Y (position 5)
- Does not contain any forbidden letters (R, O, S, E, P, N, T, W)
- L is not in position 3 (it's in 4), so this satisfies the feedback.

Therefore, the next guess should be BADLY.",Guess 4: BADLY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) D(-) L(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it cannot be in slot 1).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, but not in the first position.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has an A somewhere in positions 2-5.
- Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.

Good consonants to try next are T, N, L, C, D, etc.  
I’ll pick a word that uses A in a different position and introduces new common letters.

A good candidate is “PLANT”:
- P, L, N, T are new letters.
- A is in position 3 (not position 1, satisfying the feedback).

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   – A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   – R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   – P, N, T are not in the word.
   – L is in the word but not in position 2.
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.

So the secret word:
- Contains A (positions 2, 3, 4, or 5).
- Contains L (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, P, N, T.

Remaining common consonants we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.
We need a 5-letter word that uses A and L in permissible positions and only the allowed letters.

Good candidates:
- CABLE: C, A, B, L, E → but E is forbidden.
- GALAX: G, A, L, A, X → X is uncommon and only one A is confirmed.
- DALLY: D, A, L, L, Y → double L is possible, Y is allowed.
- MURAL: M, U, R, A, L → R is forbidden.
- VITAL: V, I, T, A, L → T is forbidden.
- WALLY: W, A, L, L, Y → valid.

""WALLY"" uses:
- W (allowed)
- A (allowed, in position 2)
- L (allowed, in position 3)
- L (allowed, in position 4)
- Y (allowed)

And it avoids all forbidden letters (R, O, S, E, P, N, T).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: WALLY -> FEEDBACK: W(x) A(✓) L(-) L(✓) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on WALLY:

- W(x) → W is NOT in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in position 2 and is correct.
- L(-) → L is in the word but not in position 3.
- L(✓) → L is in position 4 and is correct.
- Y(✓) → Y is in position 5 and is correct.

So the secret word looks like: _ A _ L Y

Known letters and positions:
- Position 2: A
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: Y

Letters confirmed NOT in the word (from all feedback):
R, O, S, E, P, N, T, W

We need to find the first and third letters. Allowed letters are those not yet ruled out. Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, etc.

Possible first letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V
Possible third letters: same list (but not L, A, Y)

Let's think of common 5-letter words ending in ""ALY"":
- BALLY → B is allowed, but we need to check if B is allowed (it isn't ruled out yet)
- FALLY → F is allowed
- GALLY → G is allowed
- HALLY → H is allowed
- KALLY → K is allowed
- MALLY → M is allowed
- VALLY → V is allowed

But ""BALLY"" is a valid word meaning a type of dance or a name, and B hasn't been ruled out. However, we need to check if this fits all constraints:
- B (position 1): allowed
- A (position 2): correct
- L (position 3): but feedback says L is not in position 3 (it's in position 4), so this would be correct because L is in position 4 here, not 3. Wait, the word is B A L L Y, so position 3 is L, but feedback says L is in the word but not in position 3. This would be a conflict because in BALLY, L appears in position 3, which is invalid.

So ""BALLY"" is invalid because L is in position 3.

Looking at other options:
- FALLY: F A L L Y → same issue, L is in position 3.
- GALLY: G A L L Y → L in position 3.
- HALLY: H A L L Y → L in position 3.
- KALLY: K A L L Y → L in position 3.
- MALLY: M A L L Y → L in position 3.
- VALLY: V A L L Y → L in position 3.

All these have L in position 3, which is invalid. Therefore, the third letter cannot be L, and the word must be _ A _ L Y with the first letter and third letter different.

Looking for words like _ A _ L Y:
- CABLE → E is forbidden.
- DALLY → L in position 3 (invalid).
- FABLE → E is forbidden.
- GABLE → E is forbidden.
- HABIT → T is forbidden.
- MABLE → E is forbidden.
- VABLE → E is forbidden.
- CABLY → not a valid word.
- DABLY → not valid.
- FABLY → not valid.
- GABLY → not valid.
- HABLY → not valid.
- MABLY → not valid.
- VABLY → not valid.

Wait, maybe the third letter is not a consonant but another vowel, but we've already used A and Y, and O, E, I are possible but O and E are forbidden. So possible vowels left: I, U.

Let's try:
- F A I L Y → FAI LY is ""FAILY"" which is not a word.
- F A U L Y → FAULY is not a word.
- M A I L Y → MAILY is not a word.
- M A U L Y → MAULY is not a word.
- C A I L Y → CAI LY is not a word.
- C A U L Y → CAULY is not a word.
- H A I L Y → HAILY is not a word.
- H A U L Y → HAULY is not a word.
- V A I L Y → VAILY is not a word.
- V A U L Y → VAULY is not a word.

Hmm, maybe the word is ""CABLE"" but E is forbidden. Let me think differently.

Actually, the word must be _ A _ L Y with first letter and third letter from remaining allowed letters. Let me list possible first and third letters:

First letter: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V
Third letter: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, I, U

Possible words:
- B A B L Y → BABLY is not a word.

- B A D L Y → BADLY is a valid word.

Wait, I'm not finding any valid words. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of actual words ending in ""ALY"" with A in position 2 and L in position 4, Y in position 5.

Possible words:
- ""CABLE"" → E is forbidden.
- ""DALLY"" → L is in position 3 (invalid).
- ""FABLE"" → E is forbidden.
- ""GABLE"" → E is forbidden.
- ""HABIT"" → T is forbidden.
- ""MAUL"" → too short.
- ""VALLY"" → L is in position 3 (invalid).

Actually, the correct word must be _ A _ L Y with the first letter and third letter from remaining allowed letters. The only valid word I can think of is ""CABLE"" but E is forbidden. 

Wait, let me check ""BALLY"" again - but L is in position 3 which is invalid. 

I realize now that the word must be ""CABLE"" but E is forbidden, so this suggests I might have made an error in previous steps. Let me re-examine:

From WALLY feedback:
- A is in position 2 (correct)
- L is in position 4 (correct)
- Y is in position 5 (correct)
- L is in the word but not in position 3 (so the other L must be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 cannot be L because L is in position 4, so position 3 must be another letter)

This implies the word is _ A _ L Y with no second L. So possible words:
- B A B L Y → BABLY is not a word.
- B A C L Y → BACLY is not a word.
- B A D L Y → BADLY is a valid word.
- B A F L Y → BAF LY is not a word.

- A (position 2): correct
- D (position 3): allowed
- L (position 4): correct

- Does not contain any forbidden letters (R, O, S, E, P, N, T, W)

Therefore, the next guess should be BADLY.

Let's update what we now know after the four guesses.

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   – A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   – R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   – P, N, T are not in the word.
   – L is in the word but not in position 2.
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.

3. WALLY → W(x) A(✓) L(-) L(✓) Y(✓)
   – W is not in the word.
   – A is in position 2 and is correct.
   – L is in the word but not in position 3.
   – L is in position 4 and is correct.
   – Y is in position 5 and is correct.

4. BADLY → B(x) A(✓) D(-) L(✓) Y(✓)
   – B is not in the word.
   – A is in position 2 and is correct.
   – D is in the word but not in position 3.
   – L is in position 4 and is correct.
   – Y is in position 5 and is correct.

So the secret word has the pattern: _ A _ L Y

Letters confirmed NOT in the word (from all feedback):
R, O, S, E, P, N, T, W, B

Letters confirmed IN the word:
- A (position 2)
- L (position 4)
- Y (position 5)
- D (somewhere, but not position 3)

Possible positions for D:
- Position 1 or 3 (since position 3 is not allowed for D from BADLY feedback)

But we also know from PLANT that A is not in position 3, and from WALLY that L is not in position 3, so position 3 is still open except for the restriction that it cannot be D (from BADLY), but D is confirmed to be in the word.

Wait, let's re-express:

From BADLY: D is in the word but not in position 3. Therefore D must be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 is excluded, so D must be in position 1.

Therefore the word must be D A _ L Y.

Now we just need to find a valid 5-letter word that starts with D, has A in position 2, L in position 4, Y in position 5, and a third letter in position 3.

Possible third letters (from remaining allowed letters):
Allowed letters are those not yet ruled out. From previous guesses, ruled out: R, O, S, E, P, N, T, W, B. Also, from PLANT, L is not in position 3 (already considered), and from BADLY, D is not in position 3.

Remaining common consonants: C, F, G, H, K, M, V, etc.

Possible words:
- D A C L Y → DACLY is not a word.
- D A F L Y → DAF LY is not a word.
- D A G L Y → DAGLY is not a word.
- D A H L Y → DAH LY is not a word.
- D A K L Y → DAKLY is not a word.
- D A M L Y → DAMLY is not a word.
- D A V L Y → DAVLY is not a word.

Wait, let me think of actual English words ending in ""ALY"" with D in position 1.

The only common word that fits is ""DALLY"", but we've already tried that (Guess 3) and it gave L(-) in position 3, which would be consistent because L is not in position 3. However, in Guess 3 (WALLY) we saw that L is in position 4, so DALLY would have L in positions 2 and 4, but we know L is only in position 4. Therefore ""DALLY"" is invalid because it has two L's and we only have one L confirmed.

Actually, we need to check if the word has only one L (since L is confirmed in position 4 and not elsewhere). So the word must be D A _ L Y with no other L's.

Looking at valid English words:
- D A C L Y → DACLY (not valid)
- D A F L Y → DAF LY (not valid)
- D A M L Y → DAMLY (not valid)
- D A V L Y → DAVLY (not valid)

The only valid word I can think of is ""DAHL Y"" but that's not a word. 

Wait, let me check ""DALLY"" again - even though it has two L's, maybe the secret word has two L's and our interpretation is wrong. From WALLY feedback: L(-) means L is in the word but not in position 3, and L(✓) in position 4. This could imply there is only one L in position 4. However, the (-) could also indicate that there's another L elsewhere (but not in position 3). 

But given that we have only one L confirmed in position 4, and no information about another L, it's safer to assume only one L. Therefore, the word must be D A _ L Y with no other L's.

After checking, the only valid word that fits is ""DALLY"" even with the double L, because ""DALLY"" is actually a valid word (meaning to waste time idly) and it has L in positions 2 and 4. However, from WALLY feedback we know L is in position 4 and not in position 3, which would be satisfied by DALLY (L not in position 3). 

But we also know from PLANT that L is not in position 2 (L(-) in PLANT means L is not in position 2). Therefore DALLY has L in position 2 which is invalid.

This suggests my earlier deduction that D must be in position 1 is correct, and the word must be D A _ L Y with a single L in position 4. The only valid word I can find is ""DAHL Y"" which is not a word, or ""DAMLY"" which is not a word.

Wait, let me think of ""DAHL Y"" - actually ""DAHL"" is a prefix, but ""DAHL Y"" is not a word. 

Realizing now that the correct word must be ""DALLY"" despite the double L, because it's the only valid word fitting the pattern and the feedback constraints. Even though L appears in position 2 (which is invalid), this indicates my assumption might be wrong. 

Re-evaluating: from BADLY feedback, D is in the word but not in position 3. This does not force D to position 1, it just says D is not in position 3. So D could be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 is excluded, so D must be in position 1. 

Thus the word must be D A _ L Y with a single L in position 4. The only valid word is ""DALLY"" but it has an extra L in position 2 which is invalid. This implies no valid word fits, which can't be.

Realizing the mistake: the word can have multiple instances of letters not ruled out. From PLANT, L is not in position 2, but can appear elsewhere. From WALLY, L is in position 4. From BADLY, D is in the word but not position 3. 

So the word must be D A L L Y - but this has L in positions 3 and 4, and from PLANT we know L is not in position 2, which is fine. Checking if DALLY is valid - yes, ""DALLY"" is a valid word meaning to waste time idly, and it fits all feedback:
- D in position 1 (not ruled out)
- A in position 2 (matches ✓)
- L in position 3 (not ruled out, only position 2 is excluded)
- L in position 4 (matches ✓)
- Y in position 5 (matches ✓)

Therefore, the correct word is DALLY.
</think>

Based on all feedback, the secret word must be D A L L Y.

   – A is in the word, but not in position 1.

3. WALLY → W(x) A(✓) L(-) L(✓) Y(✓)

   – A is in position 2 and is correct.
   – L is in the word but not in position 3.
   – L is in position 4 and is correct.
   – Y is in position 5 and is correct.

4. BADLY → B(x) A(✓) D(-) L(✓) Y(✓)
   – B is not in the word.
   – A is in position 2 and is correct.
   – D is in the word but not in position 3.
   – L is in position 4 and is correct.
   – Y is in position 5 and is correct.

So the secret word has the pattern: _ A _ L Y

Letters confirmed IN the word:

Possible positions for D:
- Position 1 or 3 (since position 3 is not allowed for D from BADLY feedback)

However, in Guess 3 (WALLY) we saw that L is in position 4, so DALLY would have L in positions 2 and 4, but we know L is only in position 4. Therefore ""DALLY"" is invalid because it has two L's and we only have one L confirmed.

Actually, we need to check if the word has only one L (since L is confirmed in position 4 and not elsewhere). So the word must be D A _ L Y with no other L's.

Looking at valid English words:
- D A C L Y → DACLY (not valid)
- D A F L Y → DAF LY (not valid)
- D A M L Y → DAMLY (not valid)
- D A V L Y → DAVLY (not valid)

The only valid word I can think of is ""DAHL Y"" but that's not a word. 

Wait, let me check ""DALLY"" again - even though it has two L's, maybe the secret word has two L's and our interpretation is wrong. From WALLY feedback: L(-) means L is in the word but not in position 3, and L(✓) in position 4. This could imply there is only one L in position 4. However, the (-) could also indicate that there's another L elsewhere (but not in position 3). 

But given that we have only one L confirmed in position 4, and no information about another L, it's safer to assume only one L. Therefore, the word must be D A _ L Y with no other L's.

After checking, the only valid word that fits is ""DALLY"" even with the double L, because ""DALLY"" is actually a valid word (meaning to waste time idly) and it has L in positions 2 and 4. However, from WALLY feedback we know L is in position 4 and not in position 3, which would be satisfied by DALLY (L not in position 3). 

But we also know from PLANT that L is not in position 2 (L(-) in PLANT means L is not in position 2). Therefore DALLY has L in position 2 which is invalid.

This suggests my earlier deduction that D must be in position 1 is correct, and the word must be D A _ L Y with a single L in position 4. The only valid word I can find is ""DAHL Y"" which is not a word, or ""DAMLY"" which is not a word.

Wait, let me think of ""DAHL Y"" - actually ""DAHL"" is a prefix, but ""DAHL Y"" is not a word. 

Realizing now that the correct word must be ""DALLY"" despite the double L, because it's the only valid word fitting the pattern and the feedback constraints. Even though L appears in position 2 (which is invalid), this indicates my assumption might be wrong. 

Re-evaluating: from BADLY feedback, D is in the word but not in position 3. This does not force D to position 1, it just says D is not in position 3. So D could be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 is excluded, so D must be in position 1. 

Thus the word must be D A _ L Y with a single L in position 4. The only valid word is ""DALLY"" but it has an extra L in position 2 which is invalid. This implies no valid word fits, which can't be.

Realizing the mistake: the word can have multiple instances of letters not ruled out. From PLANT, L is not in position 2, but can appear elsewhere. From WALLY, L is in position 4. From BADLY, D is in the word but not position 3. 

So the word must be D A L L Y - but this has L in positions 3 and 4, and from PLANT we know L is not in position 2, which is fine. Checking if DALLY is valid - yes, ""DALLY"" is a valid word meaning to waste time idly, and it fits all feedback:
- D in position 1 (not ruled out)
- A in position 2 (matches ✓)
- L in position 3 (not ruled out, only position 2 is excluded)
- L in position 4 (matches ✓)
- Y in position 5 (matches ✓)

Therefore, the correct word is DALLY.Based on all feedback, the secret word must be D A L L Y.",Guess 5: DALLY -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) A(✓) L(-) L(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it cannot be in slot 1).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, but not in the first position.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has an A somewhere in positions 2-5.
- Avoids R, O, S, E entirely.

Good consonants to try next are T, N, L, C, D, etc.  
I’ll pick a word that uses A in a different position and introduces new common letters.

A good candidate is “PLANT”:
- P, L, N, T are new letters.
- A is in position 3 (not position 1, satisfying the feedback).

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   – A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   – R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   – P, N, T are not in the word.
   – L is in the word but not in position 2.
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.

So the secret word:
- Contains A (positions 2, 3, 4, or 5).
- Contains L (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, P, N, T.

Remaining common consonants we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.
We need a 5-letter word that uses A and L in permissible positions and only the allowed letters.

Good candidates:
- CABLE: C, A, B, L, E → but E is forbidden.
- GALAX: G, A, L, A, X → X is uncommon and only one A is confirmed.
- DALLY: D, A, L, L, Y → double L is possible, Y is allowed.
- MURAL: M, U, R, A, L → R is forbidden.
- VITAL: V, I, T, A, L → T is forbidden.
- WALLY: W, A, L, L, Y → valid.

""WALLY"" uses:
- W (allowed)
- A (allowed, in position 2)
- L (allowed, in position 3)
- L (allowed, in position 4)
- Y (allowed)

And it avoids all forbidden letters (R, O, S, E, P, N, T).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: WALLY -> FEEDBACK: W(x) A(✓) L(-) L(✓) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on WALLY:

- W(x) → W is NOT in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in position 2 and is correct.
- L(-) → L is in the word but not in position 3.
- L(✓) → L is in position 4 and is correct.
- Y(✓) → Y is in position 5 and is correct.

So the secret word looks like: _ A _ L Y

Known letters and positions:
- Position 2: A
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: Y

Letters confirmed NOT in the word (from all feedback):
R, O, S, E, P, N, T, W

We need to find the first and third letters. Allowed letters are those not yet ruled out. Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, etc.

Possible first letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V
Possible third letters: same list (but not L, A, Y)

Let's think of common 5-letter words ending in ""ALY"":
- BALLY → B is allowed, but we need to check if B is allowed (it isn't ruled out yet)
- FALLY → F is allowed
- GALLY → G is allowed
- HALLY → H is allowed
- KALLY → K is allowed
- MALLY → M is allowed
- VALLY → V is allowed

But ""BALLY"" is a valid word meaning a type of dance or a name, and B hasn't been ruled out. However, we need to check if this fits all constraints:
- B (position 1): allowed
- A (position 2): correct
- L (position 3): but feedback says L is not in position 3 (it's in position 4), so this would be correct because L is in position 4 here, not 3. Wait, the word is B A L L Y, so position 3 is L, but feedback says L is in the word but not in position 3. This would be a conflict because in BALLY, L appears in position 3, which is invalid.

So ""BALLY"" is invalid because L is in position 3.

Looking at other options:
- FALLY: F A L L Y → same issue, L is in position 3.
- GALLY: G A L L Y → L in position 3.
- HALLY: H A L L Y → L in position 3.
- KALLY: K A L L Y → L in position 3.
- MALLY: M A L L Y → L in position 3.
- VALLY: V A L L Y → L in position 3.

All these have L in position 3, which is invalid. Therefore, the third letter cannot be L, and the word must be _ A _ L Y with the first letter and third letter different.

Looking for words like _ A _ L Y:
- CABLE → E is forbidden.
- DALLY → L in position 3 (invalid).
- FABLE → E is forbidden.
- GABLE → E is forbidden.
- HABIT → T is forbidden.
- MABLE → E is forbidden.
- VABLE → E is forbidden.
- CABLY → not a valid word.
- DABLY → not valid.
- FABLY → not valid.
- GABLY → not valid.
- HABLY → not valid.
- MABLY → not valid.
- VABLY → not valid.

Wait, maybe the third letter is not a consonant but another vowel, but we've already used A and Y, and O, E, I are possible but O and E are forbidden. So possible vowels left: I, U.

Let's try:
- F A I L Y → FAI LY is ""FAILY"" which is not a word.
- F A U L Y → FAULY is not a word.
- M A I L Y → MAILY is not a word.
- M A U L Y → MAULY is not a word.
- C A I L Y → CAI LY is not a word.
- C A U L Y → CAULY is not a word.
- H A I L Y → HAILY is not a word.
- H A U L Y → HAULY is not a word.
- V A I L Y → VAILY is not a word.
- V A U L Y → VAULY is not a word.

Hmm, maybe the word is ""CABLE"" but E is forbidden. Let me think differently.

Actually, the word must be _ A _ L Y with first letter and third letter from remaining allowed letters. Let me list possible first and third letters:

First letter: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V
Third letter: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, I, U

Possible words:
- B A B L Y → BABLY is not a word.

Wait, I'm not finding any valid words. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of actual words ending in ""ALY"" with A in position 2 and L in position 4, Y in position 5.

Possible words:
- ""CABLE"" → E is forbidden.
- ""DALLY"" → L is in position 3 (invalid).
- ""FABLE"" → E is forbidden.
- ""GABLE"" → E is forbidden.
- ""HABIT"" → T is forbidden.
- ""MAUL"" → too short.
- ""VALLY"" → L is in position 3 (invalid).

Actually, the correct word must be _ A _ L Y with the first letter and third letter from remaining allowed letters. The only valid word I can think of is ""CABLE"" but E is forbidden. 

Wait, let me check ""BALLY"" again - but L is in position 3 which is invalid. 

I realize now that the word must be ""CABLE"" but E is forbidden, so this suggests I might have made an error in previous steps. Let me re-examine:

From WALLY feedback:
- A is in position 2 (correct)
- L is in position 4 (correct)
- Y is in position 5 (correct)
- L is in the word but not in position 3 (so the other L must be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 cannot be L because L is in position 4, so position 3 must be another letter)

This implies the word is _ A _ L Y with no second L. So possible words:
- B A B L Y → BABLY is not a word.
- B A C L Y → BACLY is not a word.
- B A D L Y → BADLY is a valid word.
- B A F L Y → BAF LY is not a word.

- V A K L Y → VAKLY is not a word.
- V A M L Y → VAMLY is not a word.

I realize now that the correct word must be ""BADLY"" - but I didn't consider that. Let me check:
- B (position 1): allowed
- A (position 2): correct
- D (position 3): allowed
- L (position 4): correct
- Y (position 5): correct

And ""BADLY"" is a valid word meaning in a bad way. This fits all constraints:
- Contains A (position 2), L (position 4), Y (position 5)
- Does not contain any forbidden letters (R, O, S, E, P, N, T, W)
- L is not in position 3 (it's in 4), so this satisfies the feedback.

Therefore, the next guess should be BADLY.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
Guess 3: WALLY -> FEEDBACK: W(x) A(✓) L(-) L(✓) Y(✓)
Guess 4: BADLY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) D(-) L(✓) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's update what we now know after the four guesses.

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   – A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   – R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   – P, N, T are not in the word.
   – L is in the word but not in position 2.
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.

3. WALLY → W(x) A(✓) L(-) L(✓) Y(✓)
   – W is not in the word.
   – A is in position 2 and is correct.
   – L is in the word but not in position 3.
   – L is in position 4 and is correct.
   – Y is in position 5 and is correct.

4. BADLY → B(x) A(✓) D(-) L(✓) Y(✓)
   – B is not in the word.
   – A is in position 2 and is correct.
   – D is in the word but not in position 3.
   – L is in position 4 and is correct.
   – Y is in position 5 and is correct.

So the secret word has the pattern: _ A _ L Y

Letters confirmed NOT in the word (from all feedback):
R, O, S, E, P, N, T, W, B

Letters confirmed IN the word:
- A (position 2)
- L (position 4)
- Y (position 5)
- D (somewhere, but not position 3)

Possible positions for D:
- Position 1 or 3 (since position 3 is not allowed for D from BADLY feedback)

But we also know from PLANT that A is not in position 3, and from WALLY that L is not in position 3, so position 3 is still open except for the restriction that it cannot be D (from BADLY), but D is confirmed to be in the word.

Wait, let's re-express:

From BADLY: D is in the word but not in position 3. Therefore D must be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 is excluded, so D must be in position 1.

Therefore the word must be D A _ L Y.

Now we just need to find a valid 5-letter word that starts with D, has A in position 2, L in position 4, Y in position 5, and a third letter in position 3.

Possible third letters (from remaining allowed letters):
Allowed letters are those not yet ruled out. From previous guesses, ruled out: R, O, S, E, P, N, T, W, B. Also, from PLANT, L is not in position 3 (already considered), and from BADLY, D is not in position 3.

Remaining common consonants: C, F, G, H, K, M, V, etc.

Possible words:
- D A C L Y → DACLY is not a word.
- D A F L Y → DAF LY is not a word.
- D A G L Y → DAGLY is not a word.
- D A H L Y → DAH LY is not a word.
- D A K L Y → DAKLY is not a word.
- D A M L Y → DAMLY is not a word.
- D A V L Y → DAVLY is not a word.

Wait, let me think of actual English words ending in ""ALY"" with D in position 1.

The only common word that fits is ""DALLY"", but we've already tried that (Guess 3) and it gave L(-) in position 3, which would be consistent because L is not in position 3. However, in Guess 3 (WALLY) we saw that L is in position 4, so DALLY would have L in positions 2 and 4, but we know L is only in position 4. Therefore ""DALLY"" is invalid because it has two L's and we only have one L confirmed.

Actually, we need to check if the word has only one L (since L is confirmed in position 4 and not elsewhere). So the word must be D A _ L Y with no other L's.

Looking at valid English words:
- D A C L Y → DACLY (not valid)
- D A F L Y → DAF LY (not valid)
- D A M L Y → DAMLY (not valid)
- D A V L Y → DAVLY (not valid)

The only valid word I can think of is ""DAHL Y"" but that's not a word. 

Wait, let me check ""DALLY"" again - even though it has two L's, maybe the secret word has two L's and our interpretation is wrong. From WALLY feedback: L(-) means L is in the word but not in position 3, and L(✓) in position 4. This could imply there is only one L in position 4. However, the (-) could also indicate that there's another L elsewhere (but not in position 3). 

But given that we have only one L confirmed in position 4, and no information about another L, it's safer to assume only one L. Therefore, the word must be D A _ L Y with no other L's.

After checking, the only valid word that fits is ""DALLY"" even with the double L, because ""DALLY"" is actually a valid word (meaning to waste time idly) and it has L in positions 2 and 4. However, from WALLY feedback we know L is in position 4 and not in position 3, which would be satisfied by DALLY (L not in position 3). 

But we also know from PLANT that L is not in position 2 (L(-) in PLANT means L is not in position 2). Therefore DALLY has L in position 2 which is invalid.

This suggests my earlier deduction that D must be in position 1 is correct, and the word must be D A _ L Y with a single L in position 4. The only valid word I can find is ""DAHL Y"" which is not a word, or ""DAMLY"" which is not a word.

Wait, let me think of ""DAHL Y"" - actually ""DAHL"" is a prefix, but ""DAHL Y"" is not a word. 

Realizing now that the correct word must be ""DALLY"" despite the double L, because it's the only valid word fitting the pattern and the feedback constraints. Even though L appears in position 2 (which is invalid), this indicates my assumption might be wrong. 

Re-evaluating: from BADLY feedback, D is in the word but not in position 3. This does not force D to position 1, it just says D is not in position 3. So D could be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 is excluded, so D must be in position 1. 

Thus the word must be D A _ L Y with a single L in position 4. The only valid word is ""DALLY"" but it has an extra L in position 2 which is invalid. This implies no valid word fits, which can't be.

Realizing the mistake: the word can have multiple instances of letters not ruled out. From PLANT, L is not in position 2, but can appear elsewhere. From WALLY, L is in position 4. From BADLY, D is in the word but not position 3. 

So the word must be D A L L Y - but this has L in positions 3 and 4, and from PLANT we know L is not in position 2, which is fine. Checking if DALLY is valid - yes, ""DALLY"" is a valid word meaning to waste time idly, and it fits all feedback:
- D in position 1 (not ruled out)
- A in position 2 (matches ✓)
- L in position 3 (not ruled out, only position 2 is excluded)
- L in position 4 (matches ✓)
- Y in position 5 (matches ✓)

Therefore, the correct word is DALLY.Based on all feedback, the secret word must be D A L L Y.

The only valid word I can find is ""DAHL Y"" which is not a word, or ""DAMLY"" which is not a word.\n\nWait, let me think of ""DAHL Y"" - actually ""DAHL"" is a prefix, but ""DAHL Y"" is not a word. \n\nRealizing now that the correct word must be ""DALLY"" despite the double L, because it\'s the only valid word fitting the pattern and the feedback constraints. Even though L appears in position 2 (which is invalid), this indicates my assumption might be wrong. \n\nRe-evaluating: from BADLY feedback, D is in the word but not in position 3. This does not force D to position 1, it just says D is not in position 3. So D could be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 is excluded, so D must be in position 1. \n\nThus the word must be D A _ L Y with a single L in position 4. The only valid word is ""DALLY"" but it has an extra L in position 2 which is invalid. This implies no valid word fits, which can\'t be.\n\nRealizing the mistake: the word can have multiple instances of letters not ruled out. From PLANT, L is not in position 2, but can appear elsewhere. From WALLY, L is in position 4. From BADLY, D is in the word but not position 3. \n\nSo the word must be D A L L Y - but this has L in positions 3 and 4, and from PLANT we know L is not in position 2, which is fine. Checking if DALLY is valid - yes, ""DALLY"" is a valid word meaning to waste time idly, and it fits all feedback:\n- D in position 1 (not ruled out)\n- A in position 2 (matches ✓)\n- L in position 3 (not ruled out, only position 2 is excluded)\n- L in position 4 (matches ✓)\n- Y in position 5 (matches ✓)\n\nTherefore, the correct word is DALLY.Based on all feedback, the secret word must be D A L L Y.\n\n<guess>DALLY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: WALLY -> FEEDBACK: W(x) A(✓) L(-) L(✓) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: BADLY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) D(-) L(✓) Y(✓)\nGuess 5: DALLY -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) A(✓) L(-) L(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From Guess 5 (DALLY) we now have:

D(✓)  → D is in position 1 and is correct  
A(✓)  → A is in position 2 and is correct  
L(-)  → L is in the word but not in position 3  
L(✓)  → L is in position 4 and is correct  
Y(✓)  → Y is in position 5 and is correct  

So the pattern is now: D A _ L Y

The missing letter (position 3) must be:
- not L (from L(-) in DALLY)  
- not any letter already ruled out (R, O, S, E, P, N, T, W, B)  
- and it must make a valid 5-letter English word.

The only remaining consonant that fits and makes a valid word is “C”, forming D A C L Y → “DACLY” is not a word, but “DALLY” already tried.  
Wait, let me check actual dictionary: the only valid word that fits D A _ L Y is “DALLY” (already guessed) and “DAMLY” (invalid), “DAHL Y” (invalid), etc.  

But we know from DALLY feedback that L is not in position 3, so the word must have a single L in position 4 and another letter in position 3. The only valid word left is “DALLY” itself, but that would place L in position 3, which is invalid.  

This contradiction implies my earlier assumption was wrong: the word can indeed have two L’s, and the feedback simply tells us where each L must be. Thus the correct word is:

D A L L Y
