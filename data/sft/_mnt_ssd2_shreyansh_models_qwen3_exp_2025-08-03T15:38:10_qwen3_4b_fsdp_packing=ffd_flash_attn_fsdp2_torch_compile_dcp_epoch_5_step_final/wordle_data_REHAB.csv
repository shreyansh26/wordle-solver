Since this is the first guess with no prior information, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

A strong opening word would be something like ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers both vowels and consonants. This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Next try ""EARLY"":

- Positions so far:
  – A is NOT in position 1 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 2 (from EARLY).
  – R is NOT in position 2 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 3 (from EARLY).
  – E is NOT in position 5 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 1 (from EARLY).

We need two new letters. Common remaining consonants: T, N, D, C, M, P, etc. and the remaining vowel U.

Let’s try a word that uses A, R, E in new positions and adds two common new consonants. A good candidate is “CRATE”:
- C and T are new letters.
- R is in position 2 (was wrong in 2 and 3, so this is new).
- A is in position 3 (was wrong in 1 and 2, so this is new).
- T is new.
- E is in position 5 (was wrong in 5, so this is the same wrong spot, which is bad).

So E in position 5 is still wrong. Let’s try “REACT”:

- E in position 2 (new).
- A in position 3 (new).

This avoids all known wrong positions for A, R, E and adds two new letters.

Since this is the first guess with no prior information, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

A strong opening word would be something like ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers both vowels and consonants. This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd).
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but in the wrong position (not 5th).

So we know:
- Letters to keep: A, R, E (all present but misplaced)
- Letters to exclude: O, S
- We still need three more letters, none of which are O or S.

We also know:
- A is not in position 1.
- R is not in position 2.
- E is not in position 5.

I want a new word that uses A, R, E in different positions and adds two new common letters (not O or S). Good candidates are consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc. and vowels like I, U.

A good next guess is ""RAISE"" because:
- It uses R, A, E in new positions (R-1, A-2, E-3, I-4, S-5). But S is excluded, so this is bad.
Next try ""EARLY"":
- E, A, R in new positions (E-1, A-2, R-3, L-4, Y-5). This uses new letters L and Y, avoids O and S, and repositions A, R, E.

From the two guesses so far we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   – A, R, E are all in the word but in wrong positions.
   – O and S are NOT in the word.

2. EARLY → E(-) A(-) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
   – E, A, R again confirmed in the word but still misplaced.
   – L and Y are NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains exactly the letters A, R, E plus two others (not O, S, L, Y).
- Positions so far:
  – A is NOT in position 1 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 2 (from EARLY).
  – R is NOT in position 2 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 3 (from EARLY).
  – E is NOT in position 5 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 1 (from EARLY).

We need two new letters. Common remaining consonants: T, N, D, C, M, P, etc. and the remaining vowel U.

Let’s try a word that uses A, R, E in new positions and adds two common new consonants. A good candidate is “CRATE”:
- C and T are new letters.
- R is in position 2 (was wrong in 2 and 3, so this is new).
- A is in position 3 (was wrong in 1 and 2, so this is new).
- T is new.
- E is in position 5 (was wrong in 5, so this is the same wrong spot, which is bad).

So E in position 5 is still wrong. Let’s try “REACT”:
- R in position 1 (new).
- E in position 2 (new).
- A in position 3 (new).
- C and T are new.
This avoids all known wrong positions for A, R, E and adds two new letters.

Since this is the first guess with no prior information, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

A strong opening word would be something like ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers both vowels and consonants. This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd).
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but in the wrong position (not 5th).

So we know:
- Letters to keep: A, R, E (all present but misplaced)
- Letters to exclude: O, S
- We still need three more letters, none of which are O or S.

We also know:
- A is not in position 1.
- R is not in position 2.
- E is not in position 5.

I want a new word that uses A, R, E in different positions and adds two new common letters (not O or S). Good candidates are consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc. and vowels like I, U.

A good next guess is ""RAISE"" because:
- It uses R, A, E in new positions (R-1, A-2, E-3, I-4, S-5). But S is excluded, so this is bad.
Next try ""EARLY"":
- E, A, R in new positions (E-1, A-2, R-3, L-4, Y-5). This uses new letters L and Y, avoids O and S, and repositions A, R, E.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(-) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   – A, R, E are all in the word but in wrong positions.
   – O and S are NOT in the word.

2. EARLY → E(-) A(-) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
   – E, A, R again confirmed in the word but still misplaced.
   – L and Y are NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains exactly the letters A, R, E plus two others (not O, S, L, Y).
- Positions so far:
  – A is NOT in position 1 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 2 (from EARLY).
  – R is NOT in position 2 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 3 (from EARLY).
  – E is NOT in position 5 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 1 (from EARLY).

We need two new letters. Common remaining consonants: T, N, D, C, M, P, etc. and the remaining vowel U.

Let’s try a word that uses A, R, E in new positions and adds two common new consonants. A good candidate is “CRATE”:
- C and T are new letters.
- R is in position 2 (was wrong in 2 and 3, so this is new).
- A is in position 3 (was wrong in 1 and 2, so this is new).
- T is new.
- E is in position 5 (was wrong in 5, so this is the same wrong spot, which is bad).

So E in position 5 is still wrong. Let’s try “REACT”:
- R in position 1 (new).
- E in position 2 (new).
- A in position 3 (new).
- C and T are new.
This avoids all known wrong positions for A, R, E and adds two new letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(-) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
Guess 3: REACT -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) A(-) C(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on REACT:
- R(✓) → R is in the word and is in position 1.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and is in position 2.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- C(x) → C is NOT in the word.
- T(x) → T is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters confirmed: R (position 1), E (position 2), A (somewhere else).
- Letters excluded: O, S, L, Y, C, T.
- Remaining letters to try: common consonants like N, D, M, P, and vowels I, U.

We need a word that:
- Starts with RE
- Contains A but not in position 3
- Uses only letters not excluded so far (no O, S, L, Y, C, T)

Possible structure: RE _ _ _
A must be in position 4 or 5.

Good candidates:
- REBAN (but B is less common)
- REBID (B, I, D)
- REPAIR (but P is okay, A in position 4)
- REBRA (but second R is possible)
- REBAS (but S is excluded)
- REBAD (B, A, D)

""REBID"" seems good: starts with RE, has A in position 4, uses B and I which haven't been excluded.

But let me check positions:
- R is correct in 1, E in 2
- B new, I new, D new
- A in 4 is allowed (was wrong in 3, now 4 is fine)

From the feedback so far:

1. R is locked in position 1.
2. E is locked in position 2.
3. A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (from AROSE, EARLY, REACT, REBID).  
   Therefore A must be in position 5.
4. Letters already excluded: O, S, L, Y, C, T, I, D.
5. Remaining unused common letters: N, U, M, P, G, H, K, etc.

Word pattern so far: R E _ _ A

We need two more letters (positions 3 and 4) from the remaining pool, avoiding all excluded letters.

Good candidates:
- R E M A N
- R E M A Y (but Y is excluded)
- R E B A N (B already tried in REBID, and B is in word but wrong position)
- R E G A M
- R E M A N (valid, uses M and N which are allowed)

""REMAN"" fits the pattern and uses allowed letters.

From the latest feedback:

- R is locked in position 1.
- E is locked in position 2.
- A is locked in position 4.
- N is NOT in the word (position 5).
- M is NOT in the word (position 3).

So the word pattern is: R E _ A _

Letters still allowed (have not been marked x):  
B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  
(we already know A, R, E are present and in their correct spots).

We need one letter for position 3 and one letter for position 5, chosen only from the allowed set.

Common remaining consonants that often appear together:  
- Position 3: B, G, H, K, P  
- Position 5: N is excluded, so common endings like “-AN” or “-EA” don’t apply here.

Looking at common 5-letter words fitting R E _ A _ :

- R E B A N → N is excluded (already tried in REMAN)  
- R E G A B → “REGAB” isn’t a valid English word  
- R E G A L → “REGAL” is a valid word (means royal or imperial)  
- R E H A N → “REHAN” isn’t valid  
- R E P A R → “REPAR” isn’t valid  
- R E P A N → N excluded  
- R E B A K → “REBAK” isn’t valid  
- R E G A M → M excluded  
- R E P A G → “REPA G” isn’t valid  
- R E B A G → “REBAG” isn’t valid  

The only valid word that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters is “REGAL”.

Let’s verify:
- R(1), E(2), G(3), A(4), L(5)  
- L has not been excluded (only O, S, L was excluded in earlier guess, but that was in EARLY where L was marked x, so L is excluded).  
Wait – L was marked x in EARLY (Guess 2), so L is excluded.

Next candidate:  
- R E B A N – N excluded  
- R E G A B – not a word  
- R E P A G – not a word  
- R E K A N – not a word  
- R E P A R – not a word  
- R E B A K – not a word  
- R E H A N – not a word  
- R E P A N – N excluded  
- R E G A M – M excluded  

Another valid word: “REBAN” – but N is excluded.  
“REPAK” – not a word.  
“REHAB” – not a word.  
“REBAS” – S excluded.  
“REBAG” – not a word.  

Wait – let me re-examine the allowed letters more carefully.  
Excluded letters so far: O, S, L, Y, C, T, I, D, M, N.  
Allowed letters: A, R, E, B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  

We need:
- position 3: any of B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  
- position 5: any of B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (but not N)

Looking for valid English words:

- R E B A N – N excluded  
- R E G A L – L excluded  
- R E P A R – not a word  
- R E B A G – not a word  
- R E H A N – not a word  
- R E K A N – not a word  
- R E B A F – not a word  
- R E G A F – not a word  
- R E P A G – not a word  
- R E B A K – not a word  
- R E H A B – not a word  
- R E P A N – N excluded  
- R E B A V – not a word  
- R E G A V – not a word  
- R E P A V – not a word  
- R E B A F – not a word  

Hmm, seems limited. Let me think of common 5-letter words starting with RE and ending with A _ :

- REACT – already tried  
- REBID – already tried  
- REBAN – already tried  
- REBEL – L excluded  
- REBUT – T excluded  
- RECAP – C excluded  
- RECK – too short  
- RECKON – too long  
- REDACT – T excluded  
- REDO – too short  
- REDOUBT – too long  
- REFER – already has E in position 2  
- REGAIN – I excluded  
- REGARD – D excluded  
- REGAS – S excluded  
- REGATE – T excluded  
- REBEL – L excluded  
- REBELL – too long  
- REBELS – L and S excluded  
- REBID – already tried  
- REBITE – I excluded  
- REBLOW – L and O excluded  
- REBON – N excluded  
- REBOW – W is allowed, but “REBOW” isn’t a word  
- REBOX – X is allowed, “REBOX” isn’t a word  
- REBRA – R is already used  
- REBRA – same  
- REBRA – same  
- REBRA – same  

Wait, let me try a systematic approach with the allowed letters:

Possible letters for position 3: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  
Possible letters for position 5: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  

We need a valid English word R E _ A _ with the above letters.

Looking through a mental list, “REBAG” isn’t valid, “REGAB” isn’t valid, “REHAB” isn’t valid, “REJAB” isn’t valid, “REKAB” isn’t valid, “REFAG” isn’t valid, “REFAK” isn’t valid, “REGAF” isn’t valid, “REGAK” isn’t valid, “REHAF” isn’t valid, “REHAK” isn’t valid, “REJAF” isn’t valid, “REJAK” isn’t valid, “REPAK” isn’t valid, “REPAG” isn’t valid, “REPAF” isn’t valid, “REPAH” isn’t valid, “REPAK” already considered, “REPAV” isn’t valid, “REPAW” isn’t valid, “REPAX” isn’t valid, “REPAY” isn’t valid (Y excluded), “REP AZ” isn’t valid, “REBAN” already considered, “REBAR” – R is already used in position 1, so duplicate R is allowed but “REBAR” is a word, let’s check:

REBAR:
- R(1), E(2), B(3), A(4), R(5)  
- B is allowed (not excluded)  
- R in position 5 is allowed (no info against it)  
- All letters are allowed (no O, S, L, Y, C, T, I, D, M, N in it)  

“REBAR” is a valid English word meaning a bar of iron or steel, often used in construction.

Let me verify:
- R is in position 1 (correct)  
- E is in position 2 (correct)  
- B is in position 3 (new position, allowed)  
- A is in position 4 (correct)  
- R is in position 5 (new position, allowed)  

No excluded letters are used, and it fits the pattern.

Therefore, the next guess should be “REBAR”.

- R is locked in position 1.

- position 3: any of B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  
- position 5: any of B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (but not N)

Looking for valid English words:

- R E B A N – N excluded  
- R E G A L – L excluded  
- R E P A R – not a word  
- R E B A G – not a word  
- R E H A N – not a word  
- R E K A N – not a word  
- R E B A F – not a word  
- R E G A F – not a word  
- R E P A G – not a word  
- R E B A K – not a word  
- R E H A B – not a word  
- R E P A N – N excluded  
- R E B A V – not a word  
- R E G A V – not a word  
- R E P A V – not a word  
- R E B A F – not a word  

Hmm, seems limited. Let me think of common 5-letter words starting with RE and ending with A _ :

- REACT – already tried  
- REBID – already tried  
- REBAN – already tried  
- REBEL – L excluded  
- REBUT – T excluded  
- RECAP – C excluded  
- RECK – too short  
- RECKON – too long  
- REDACT – T excluded  
- REDO – too short  
- REDOUBT – too long  
- REFER – already has E in position 2  
- REGAIN – I excluded  
- REGARD – D excluded  
- REGAS – S excluded  
- REGATE – T excluded  
- REBEL – L excluded  
- REBELL – too long  
- REBELS – L and S excluded  
- REBID – already tried  
- REBITE – I excluded  
- REBLOW – L and O excluded  
- REBON – N excluded  
- REBOW – W is allowed, but “REBOW” isn’t a word  
- REBOX – X is allowed, “REBOX” isn’t a word  
- REBRA – R is already used  
- REBRA – same  
- REBRA – same  
- REBRA – same  

Wait, let me try a systematic approach with the allowed letters:

Possible letters for position 3: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  
Possible letters for position 5: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  

We need a valid English word R E _ A _ with the above letters.

Looking through a mental list, “REBAG” isn’t valid, “REGAB” isn’t valid, “REHAB” isn’t valid, “REJAB” isn’t valid, “REKAB” isn’t valid, “REFAG” isn’t valid, “REFAK” isn’t valid, “REGAF” isn’t valid, “REGAK” isn’t valid, “REHAF” isn’t valid, “REHAK” isn’t valid, “REJAF” isn’t valid, “REJAK” isn’t valid, “REPAK” isn’t valid, “REPAG” isn’t valid, “REPAF” isn’t valid, “REPAH” isn’t valid, “REPAK” already considered, “REPAV” isn’t valid, “REPAW” isn’t valid, “REPAX” isn’t valid, “REPAY” isn’t valid (Y excluded), “REP AZ” isn’t valid, “REBAN” already considered, “REBAR” – R is already used in position 1, so duplicate R is allowed but “REBAR” is a word, let’s check:

REBAR:
- R(1), E(2), B(3), A(4), R(5)  
- B is allowed (not excluded)  
- R in position 5 is allowed (no info against it)  
- All letters are allowed (no O, S, L, Y, C, T, I, D, M, N in it)  

“REBAR” is a valid English word meaning a bar of iron or steel, often used in construction.

Let me verify:
- R is in position 1 (correct)  
- E is in position 2 (correct)  
- B is in position 3 (new position, allowed)  
- A is in position 4 (correct)  
- R is in position 5 (new position, allowed)  

No excluded letters are used, and it fits the pattern.

Therefore, the next guess should be “REBAR”.",Guess 6: REBAR -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) B(-) A(✓) R(-),FAIL
