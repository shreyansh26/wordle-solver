### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 5 unique letters
2. Uses very common letters (A, R, O, S, E)
3. Has no repeated letters, maximizing the chance of hitting letters in the secret word

This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the second guess.

- Avoids R, O, S entirely.

A good candidate is “LEANT”:
- L, N, T are new letters.
- A is moved to position 2 (not 1, so possible).
- E is moved to position 3 (not 5, so possible).

A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain.\n\nLooking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:\n1. It contains 5 unique letters\n2. Uses very common letters (A, R, O, S, E)\n3. Has no repeated letters, maximizing the chance of hitting letters in the secret word\n\nThis should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the second guess.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.\n- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.\n- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.\n- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.\n- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Contains A and E.\n- Does NOT contain R, O, or S.\n- A is not in position 1, E is not in position 5.\n\nTo maximize information with the second guess, I’ll choose a word that:\n- Uses the known letters A and E in new positions.\n- Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, L, N, I, C, etc.).\n- Avoids R, O, S entirely.\n\nA good candidate is “LEANT”:\n- L, N, T are new letters.\n- A is moved to position 2 (not 1, so possible).\n- E is moved to position 3 (not 5, so possible).\n\nLet’s try it.\n\n<guess>LEANT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: LEANT -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(✓) A(-) N(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two rounds of feedback:\n\n1.

Let's consolidate what we know after the three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - R, O, S are absent.

2. LEANT → L(x) E(✓) A(-) N(x) T(x)
   - E is in position 2 (✓).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - L, N, T are absent.

3. PEACH → P(x) E(✓) A(-) C(-) H(x)
   - E is in position 2 (✓) – already known.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 or 4.
   - C is in the word but not in position 4.
   - P and H are absent.

So the pattern is: _ E _ _ _
Letters known to be present: A, C, E
Letters known to be absent: P, H, L, N, R, O, S, T
Positions ruled out for A: 1, 3, 4
Therefore A must be in position 5.

Similarly, C is in the word but not in position 4. Possible positions: 1, 3, 5. But 5 is now taken by A, so C must be in 1 or 3.

Remaining common letters to test: D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's try to place C in position 1 and test new letters in 3 and 4.

Candidate: C E _ _ A
We need two more letters for positions 3 and 4, avoiding all eliminated ones.

Let's pick C E M I A – but I is okay, M is okay. However, we need to check if this is a valid word. ""CEMIA"" is not a valid English word.

Next candidate: C E D A R – but R is eliminated.

Next: C E M A N – N is eliminated.

Next: C E M A P – P is eliminated.

Next: C E M A Y – ""CEMAY"" is not a word.

Next: C E G A M – ""CEGAM"" is not a word.

Next: C E M A D – ""CEMAD"" is not a word.

Let's try C in position 3 instead: _ E C _ A
Then positions 1 and 4 need new letters.

Candidate: D E C A Y – ""DECA Y"" is not a word, but ""DECAY"" is valid.

Check letters: D, E, C, A, Y – all allowed, no eliminated letters, and positions:
- D in 1 (new)
- E in 2 (✓)
- C in 3 (allowed)
- A in 5 (must be here)
- Y in 4 (new)

DECAY fits all constraints.
