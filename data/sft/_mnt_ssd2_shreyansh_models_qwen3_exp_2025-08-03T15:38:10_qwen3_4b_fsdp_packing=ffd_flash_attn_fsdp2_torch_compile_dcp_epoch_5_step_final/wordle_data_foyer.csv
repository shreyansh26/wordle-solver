### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This will give us good information about which letters are present in the secret word and their positions.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This will give us good information about which letters are present in the secret word and their positions.\n\n<guess>arose</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A is not in the word (x)\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)\n- O is in the word but not in position 3 (-)\n- S is not in the word (x)\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)\n\nSo the secret word contains R, O, and E, but not A or S.  \nWe know:\n- R is not in position 2\n- O is not in position 3\n- E is not in position 5\n\nI need a new 5-letter word that uses R, O, E and avoids A and S.  \nAlso, I should place R, O, E in new positions to gather more information.\n\nA good candidate is ""TOWER"":\n- Uses T (new letter), O (known), W (new), E (known), R (known)\n- Places O in position 2 (was 3 before), E in position 4 (was 5 before), R in position 5 (was 2 before)\n- Introduces T and W to test new letters\n\n<guess>tower</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tower -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two rounds of feedback:\n\n1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)\n   - Letters known to be in the word: R, O, E  \n   - Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, S  \n   - Position constraints:  \n     – R is not in position 2  \n     – O is not in position 3  \n     – E is not in position 5  \n\n2. tower → T(x) O(✓) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n   - Confirms:  \n     – O is in position 2 (✓)  \n     – E is in position 4 (✓)  \n     – R is in position 5 (✓)  \n   - Eliminates T and W (both marked x).\n\nSo the secret word has the fixed pattern:\n_ O _ E R\n\nWe still need two new letters for positions 1 and 3.  \nLetters already ruled out: A, S, T, W.  \nWe can test common consonants or vowels for the remaining spots.\n\nA good candidate is “FOGER”:\n- F and G are new letters to test.  \n- Fits the pattern _ O _ E R exactly (positions 2=O, 4=E, 5=R).  \n- Uses F in position 1 and G in position 3.\n\nThis should quickly tell us the correct letters for positions 1 and 3.\n\n<guess>foger</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tower -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 3: foger -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) O(✓) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
Current confirmed information:

1. Pattern so far: F O _ E R
2. Letters known to be in the word and their positions:
   - F (position 1)
   - O (position 2)
   - E (position 4)
   - R (position 5)
3. Letter G is NOT in the word (marked x in position 3).
4. Remaining unknown letter is in position 3.  
   We need a single letter that:
   - Has not been ruled out (not A, S, T, W, G)
   - Is a valid 5-letter English word of the form F O _ E R

Common consonants still allowed: B, C, D, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z  
Vowels still allowed: I, U (since A is already ruled out)

Looking for valid words:
- F O B E R → “FOBER” – not a standard word
- F O C E R → “FOCER” – not standard
- F O D E R → “FODER” – not standard
- F O I E R → “FOIER” – valid (archaic spelling of “forer” or “forester”)
- F O L E R → “FOLER” – not standard
- F O M E R → “FOMER” – not standard
- F O N E R → “FONER” – not standard
- F O P E R → “FOPER” – not standard
- F O V E R → “FOVER” – not standard
- F O X E R → “FOXER” – not standard
- F O Y E R → “FOYER” – valid (room in a house)

Between FOIER and Foyer, “FOYER” is the more common word and uses Y, which is still allowed.

Therefore, the next logical guess is Foyer.
