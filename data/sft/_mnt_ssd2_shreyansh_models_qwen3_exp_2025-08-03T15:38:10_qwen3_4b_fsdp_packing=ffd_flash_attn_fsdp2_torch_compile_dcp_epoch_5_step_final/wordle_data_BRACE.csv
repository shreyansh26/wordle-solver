For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word should include common vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", etc. 

Looking at these options, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (common vowel)

This gives me a good spread of letters to test against the secret word. I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not at position 1).
- R is in the correct position (position 2).
- A is in the correct position (position 3).
- E is in the correct position (position 5).
- N is not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is:
_ R A _ E

Letters known to be in the word: R, A, E, C (but C is not in position 1).
Letters known NOT in the word: N.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in position 2.
2. Has A in position 3.
3. Has E in position 5.
4. Contains C somewhere other than position 1.
5. Does not contain N.

Possible words that fit this pattern: C R A _ E
Looking at common letters for position 4, options could be:
- C R A C E (but C is already used in position 1, and we know C is not in position 1, so this is invalid)
- C R A P E (P is possible, but let’s check if this fits all constraints)
- C R A M E (M is possible)
- C R A L E (L is possible)
- C R A D E (D is possible)
- C R A S E (S is possible)

However, we know C is in the word but not in position 1, so position 1 could be any letter except C, but we have R fixed in position 2. So the word structure is _ R A _ E with C somewhere else.

Wait, let me re-examine: the feedback says C is in the word but wrong position (position 1), so C must be in positions 2-5. But position 2 is R, position 3 is A, position 5 is E, so C must be in position 4.

Thus, the word must be _ R A C E.

Looking at common first letters for this pattern:
- B R A C E (valid word)
- F R A C E (not a valid word)
- P R A C E (not valid)
- S P A C E (but S is position 1, P is position 4, but we need R in position 2)

The only valid word fitting _ R A C E is B R A C E.

Let me verify:
- B R A C E:
  - B: not tested yet, could be in position 1.
  - R: position 2 (matches ✓)
  - A: position 3 (matches ✓)
  - C: position 4 (since C was wrong at position 1, this is new position)
  - E: position 5 (matches ✓)
- Does not contain N (good)
- All letters are valid and fit constraints.

So I'll guess B R A C E.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not at position 1).
- R is in the correct position (position 2).
- A is in the correct position (position 3).
- E is in the correct position (position 5).
- N is not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is:
_ R A _ E

Letters known to be in the word: R, A, E, C (but C is not in position 1).
Letters known NOT in the word: N.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in position 2.
2. Has A in position 3.
3. Has E in position 5.
4. Contains C somewhere other than position 1.
5. Does not contain N.

Possible words that fit this pattern: C R A _ E
Looking at common letters for position 4, options could be:
- C R A C E (but C is already used in position 1, and we know C is not in position 1, so this is invalid)
- C R A P E (P is possible, but let’s check if this fits all constraints)
- C R A M E (M is possible)
- C R A L E (L is possible)
- C R A D E (D is possible)
- C R A S E (S is possible)

However, we know C is in the word but not in position 1, so position 1 could be any letter except C, but we have R fixed in position 2. So the word structure is _ R A _ E with C somewhere else.

Wait, let me re-examine: the feedback says C is in the word but wrong position (position 1), so C must be in positions 2-5. But position 2 is R, position 3 is A, position 5 is E, so C must be in position 4.

Thus, the word must be _ R A C E.

Looking at common first letters for this pattern:
- B R A C E (valid word)
- F R A C E (not a valid word)
- P R A C E (not valid)
- S P A C E (but S is position 1, P is position 4, but we need R in position 2)

The only valid word fitting _ R A C E is B R A C E.

Let me verify:
- B R A C E:
  - B: not tested yet, could be in position 1.
  - R: position 2 (matches ✓)
  - A: position 3 (matches ✓)
  - C: position 4 (since C was wrong at position 1, this is new position)
  - E: position 5 (matches ✓)
- Does not contain N (good)
- All letters are valid and fit constraints.

So I'll guess B R A C E.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Pattern so far: B R A _ E  
Letters confirmed: B, R, A, E are all in their exact positions 1–2–3–5.  
Letters ruled out: N, K are not in the word at all.  
Remaining unknown letter: position 4.

We need a single letter that:
- is **not** N or K  
- makes a valid 5-letter English word of the form BRA_E

Scanning common letters for position 4:
- B R A C E  – valid  
- B R A D E  – not a word  
- B R A F E  – not a word  
- B R A G E  – not a word  
- B R A I E  – not a word  
- B R A L E  – not a word  
- B R A M E  – not a word  
- B R A P E  – not a word  
- B R A S E  – valid  
- B R A T E  – not a word  
- B R A V E  – valid  

The only common valid words are BRACE, BRAKE (already tried), and BRAVE.  
Since K was already ruled out, the remaining candidates are BRACE and BRAVE.

Between these two, let’s pick BRAVE because V is a common consonant and hasn’t been tested yet.

So far we have:

Pattern: B R A _ E  
Letters confirmed: B, R, A, E are locked in positions 1, 2, 3, 5  
Letters ruled out: N, K, V are NOT in the word  
Therefore the missing letter (position 4) must be any letter that:
- is NOT N, K, or V  
- forms a valid English word B R A _ E  

Common remaining letters for position 4:
C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, P, S, T, W, Y, etc.

Valid English words:
B R A C E  – valid  
B R A D E  – not a word  
B R A F E  – not a word  
B R A G E  – not a word  
B R A H E  – not a word  
B R A I E  – not a word  
B R A L E  – not a word  
B R A M E  – not a word  
B R A P E  – not a word  
B R A S E  – valid  
B R A T E  – not a word  
B R A W E  – not a word  
B R A Y E  – not a word  

Only two valid options remain: BRACE and BRASE.  
Since C has not been tested yet, and we know C was marked “-” (present but wrong position) in CRANE (position 1), it must be in position 4.  
So the word must be BRACE.

(If we tried BRASE, the letter S would be new and untested, but BRACE is the only common word that fits all constraints.)
