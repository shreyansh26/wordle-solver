### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L
2. Common vowels like A, E, I, O, U
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A balanced first guess could be ""AROSE"" which contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters

This gives us a good spread to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains R and E, but R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.
- The word does NOT contain A, O, or S.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses R and E (positions unknown, but R≠2, E≠5)
- Avoids A, O, S
- Has 5 unique letters (to maximize info)

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, U (since A, O, E are either confirmed or ruled out)

Let’s pick a word that places R and E in new positions and introduces new common letters.  
“TREND” uses:
- T (common consonant)
- R (known to be in word, now in position 2 – but feedback said R is NOT in position 2, so this is bad) → scratch.

Instead, place R elsewhere.  
“ENTRY” uses:
- E in position 1 (new position, since E can’t be in 5)
- N, T, Y (new letters)
- R in position 4 (allowed, since R can’t be in 2)
But E is in position 1, which is fine.

But let’s try to spread out the vowels.  
“URINE” uses:
- U (new vowel)
- R in position 2 – but R can’t be in 2 → bad.

“CRUEL”:
- C (new consonant)
- R in position 2 – can’t be → bad.

“INTER”:
- I (new vowel)
- N, T (new consonants)
- E in position 3 (allowed)
- R in position 5 (allowed)
This seems good: tests I, N, T, plus positions for E and R.

But let’s check:  
INTER → positions: I(1), N(2), T(3), E(4), R(5)  
R is in position 5 (allowed, since R is not in 2)  
E is in position 4 (allowed, since E is not in 5)  
Letters used: I, N, T, E, R – none of A, O, S  
This looks optimal.

- The word contains I, but I is not in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain A, O, S, N, T.

Letters we have so far: _ _ _ E R  
Letters we know are present: I, E, R  
Letters we know are absent: A, O, S, N, T  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with “ER”.
2. Contains I somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (but 4 is already E, so positions 2 or 3).
3. Uses only letters not in the absent set.

Possible letters left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the known I, E, R.

Let’s think of words ending in “ER” that contain I in position 2 or 3:
- If I is in position 2: _ I _ E R → e.g., “D I _ E R” → “D I V E R” (but V is allowed, D is allowed). However, “DIVER” is a valid word.
- If I is in position 3: _ _ I E R → e.g., “B R I E R” (but R is already in position 5, and we don’t know if R is repeated). “PRIER” is not valid. “CRIER” is valid but has R in position 3 which might be possible.

Between “DIVER” and “CRIER”:
- “DIVER” has D, I, V, E, R. All letters are allowed (D, V not in absent set), I is in position 2 (allowed), ends with ER. This seems good.
- “CRIER” has C, R, I, E, R. R is allowed to repeat? The rules don’t forbid repeats, but we have no info that R repeats. “DIVER” seems safer.

Another option: “WIDER” (W, I, D, E, R). Also valid.

Let’s choose “WIDER” because it introduces W and D, two new consonants, while satisfying all constraints.

Check:
- Ends with ER: yes (positions 4=E, 5=R).
- Contains I: yes in position 2.
- No forbidden letters (A, O, S, N, T): W, D, I, E, R are all allowed.
