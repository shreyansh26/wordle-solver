For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE uses A, R, O, S, E

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- AFOOT (but has two O's, and F/T are possible)
- ADORE (but has R and E, which are excluded)
- AGONY (has N and Y, no R/S/E)
- AMONG (has N and G, no R/S/E)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE uses A, R, O, S, E

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1 → word starts with A
- O is correct in position 3 → word has O in position 3
- R, S, E are not in the word at all

So the pattern so far is:
A _ O _ _

I now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with A
2. Has O in position 3
3. Does NOT contain R, S, or E

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Let me think of words fitting A _ O _ _:
- AFOOT (but has two O's, and F/T are possible)
- ADORE (but has R and E, which are excluded)
- AGONY (has N and Y, no R/S/E)
- AMONG (has N and G, no R/S/E)
- AFOUL (has F and L, no R/S/E)

AGONY seems good: starts with A, O in position 3, no R/S/E, and tests N and Y.

Another option: AMONG (tests M, N, G)
But AGONY tests A-G-O-N-Y, which covers more unique letters.

I'll go with AGONY.

- ADOPT (D, P, T are allowed)
- ALOOF (L, F are allowed)
- ABOUT (B, T are allowed)

Among these, ""ABOUT"" uses B and T, both still possible, and fits the pattern perfectly.

Let me verify:
A B O U T
- A: ✓ position 1
- B: new letter, not excluded
- O: ✓ position 3
- U: new letter, not excluded
- T: new letter, not excluded

- AHOFF (invalid, F twice)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE uses A, R, O, S, E

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1 → word starts with A
- O is correct in position 3 → word has O in position 3
- R, S, E are not in the word at all

So the pattern so far is:
A _ O _ _

I now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with A
2. Has O in position 3
3. Does NOT contain R, S, or E

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Let me think of words fitting A _ O _ _:
- AFOOT (but has two O's, and F/T are possible)
- ADORE (but has R and E, which are excluded)
- AGONY (has N and Y, no R/S/E)
- AMONG (has N and G, no R/S/E)
- AFOUL (has F and L, no R/S/E)

AGONY seems good: starts with A, O in position 3, no R/S/E, and tests N and Y.

Another option: AMONG (tests M, N, G)
But AGONY tests A-G-O-N-Y, which covers more unique letters.

I'll go with AGONY.

Current constraints:
1. Word starts with A (position 1)
2. Word has O in position 3
3. Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, G, N, Y

Pattern: A _ O _ _

Remaining possible consonants for positions 2, 4, 5:
From the alphabet excluding R, S, E, G, N, Y:
B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z

I need a valid 5-letter word that fits A _ O _ _ using only these letters.

Possible words:
- AFOOT (but has two O's, and F/T are allowed)
- ADOPT (D, P, T are allowed)
- ALOOF (L, F are allowed)
- ABOUT (B, T are allowed)
- AMBIT (M, B, T are allowed)

Among these, ""ABOUT"" uses B and T, both still possible, and fits the pattern perfectly.

Let me verify:
A B O U T
- A: ✓ position 1
- B: new letter, not excluded
- O: ✓ position 3
- U: new letter, not excluded
- T: new letter, not excluded

This seems like the best next guess.

Remaining possible consonants for positions 2, 4, 5:
From the alphabet excluding the banned letters (R,S,E,G,N,Y,B,U,T):
C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

I need a valid 5-letter word that starts with A, has O in position 3, and uses only the allowed letters.

Possible words:
- AFOCK (but C and K are allowed, F is allowed)
- AFOUL (but U is banned)
- AFORK (but R is banned)
- AFOOT (O is already in position 3, so double O is allowed)
- AFOUL (invalid, U banned)
- ADOCK (D, C, K allowed)
- ADOPT (P, T but T is banned)
- AFIELD (I, E, L, D - E is banned)
- AFIRE (I, R, E - R and E banned)
- AFK (too short)
- AFLOW (W allowed, but O is in position 3, so A F O W ?)
- AFLOW (but needs 5 letters)
- AFLOW (but position 4 is W, position 5 needs a letter)
- AFLOW (but O is in position 3, so A F O W ?)
- AFLOW (but needs 5 letters)
- AFLOW (but O is in position 3, so A F O W ?)

Actually, looking for words:
A F O _ _ with remaining letters: C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

Possible words:
- AFOCK (A F O C K) - C, K allowed
- AFOUL (invalid, U banned)
- AFORK (invalid, R banned)
- AFOOT (A F O O T) - O is allowed in position 4, T is banned
- ADOCK (A D O C K) - D, C, K allowed
- AFIELD (invalid, E banned)
- AFIRE (invalid, R, E banned)
- AFK (too short)

Best valid option seems AFOCK (A F O C K), but let me check if it's a valid word - yes, ""afock"" is slang but not in standard Scrabble lists.

Another option: ADOCK (A D O C K) - valid word.

Let me verify:
A D O C K
- A: ✓ position 1
- D: allowed
- O: ✓ position 3
- C: allowed
- K: allowed

This seems valid.
