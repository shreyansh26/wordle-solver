For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any letters, to test as many different letters as possible. 

A good choice is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This should give me good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (✓) → last letter is E

So the secret word ends with E, has an O somewhere in positions 1-4, and does NOT contain A, R, or S.

Good letters to test next: T, N, I, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.  
I want a word that keeps the confirmed E in place, places the O in a new spot, and introduces several new common letters.  
Candidate: “POINT” – but P isn’t tested yet and I is good, but N and T are also useful.  
Better: “UNTIE” – but repeats no letters and keeps E at the end.  
Actually, “UNTIE” has I in the 4th spot and E fixed at 5th, but O isn’t tested.  
Wait, I need to test O in a different position.  

Let’s try “TONER” – but R is already ruled out.  
How about “COVEY”? C, O, V, E, Y – but Y is less common.  
“DOING” – D, O, I, N, G – all new letters, O in 2nd position, E isn’t used here.  
But E must be in 5th.  

So “DOING” is invalid because it doesn’t keep E in 5th.  
Correct form: must have E as last letter, include O somewhere else, and avoid A, R, S.  

“OCEAN” – but A is ruled out.  
“VOICE” – V, O, I, C, E – all new letters except E, and O is in 2nd position.  
This seems good: tests V, O, I, C while keeping E fixed.  

But “VOICE” has O in 2nd, E in 5th – satisfies constraints.  
Another check: no A, R, S – correct.

“VOICE” – V, O, I, C, E – all new letters except E, and O is in 2nd position.  
This seems good: tests V, O, I, C while keeping E fixed.  

But “VOICE” has O in 2nd, E in 5th – satisfies constraints.  
Another check: no A, R, S – correct.  
“VOICE” is valid 5-letter word.

   - E is in the word but not in position 5.  
     This directly contradicts the earlier feedback that E is in position 5 (✓).  
     Therefore, the feedback must be interpreted as:  
     - E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (because the symbol was “-”).  
     - This means the earlier interpretation was wrong: the E in MONEY was marked “-”, not “✓”.  
     - So the secret word does NOT have E in position 5.

Re-evaluating carefully:

- Guess 1 AROSE: E(✓) → E is in position 5.
- Guess 2 VOICE: E(✓) → E is in position 5.
- Guess 3 MONEY: E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

These two statements are contradictory. The only consistent interpretation is that the feedback for MONEY’s E was a typo, and it should be “-” (wrong position), meaning E is NOT in position 5. Therefore, the earlier feedback that E is in position 5 must be incorrect. The correct understanding is:

- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- O is confirmed in position 2.
- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, V, I, C, M, N, Y.

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ _

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any letters, to test as many different letters as possible. 

A good choice is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This should give me good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (✓) → last letter is E

So the secret word ends with E, has an O somewhere in positions 1-4, and does NOT contain A, R, or S.

Good letters to test next: T, N, I, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.  
I want a word that keeps the confirmed E in place, places the O in a new spot, and introduces several new common letters.  
Candidate: “POINT” – but P isn’t tested yet and I is good, but N and T are also useful.  
Better: “UNTIE” – but repeats no letters and keeps E at the end.  
Actually, “UNTIE” has I in the 4th spot and E fixed at 5th, but O isn’t tested.  
Wait, I need to test O in a different position.  

Let’s try “TONER” – but R is already ruled out.  
How about “COVEY”? C, O, V, E, Y – but Y is less common.  
“DOING” – D, O, I, N, G – all new letters, O in 2nd position, E isn’t used here.  
But E must be in 5th.  

So “DOING” is invalid because it doesn’t keep E in 5th.  
Correct form: must have E as last letter, include O somewhere else, and avoid A, R, S.  

“OCEAN” – but A is ruled out.  
“VOICE” – V, O, I, C, E – all new letters except E, and O is in 2nd position.  
This seems good: tests V, O, I, C while keeping E fixed.  

But “VOICE” has O in 2nd, E in 5th – satisfies constraints.

Let's carefully re-examine all feedback step by step.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is in position 5.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. VOICE → V(x) O(✓) I(x) C(x) E(✓)
   - O is in position 2.
   - E is in position 5.
   - V, I, C are not in the word.

3. MONEY → M(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)
   - O is in position 2 (confirmed).
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.  
     This directly contradicts the earlier feedback that E is in position 5 (✓).  
     Therefore, the feedback for MONEY must have been mis-recorded.  
     The correct interpretation is: E(-) means E is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
     So we now know:
     - The word does NOT have E in position 5.
     - The word DOES have E somewhere, but not in position 5.
     - Letters ruled out: A, R, S, V, I, C, M, N, Y.

4. POGUE → P(x) O(✓) G(-) U(x) E(✓)
   - O is in position 2 (confirmed).
   - E is in position 5 (✓).  
     This now re-confirms that E is in position 5, resolving the contradiction.  
     So the earlier feedback for MONEY must have been a typo; the E should have been (✓) not (-).  
     Therefore, the word has:
     - O in position 2.
     - E in position 5.
     - Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, V, I, C, M, N, Y, P, U.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ E
- Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, T, W, X, Z
- Common letters among these: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, T, W

We need a 5-letter word with O in position 2 and E in position 5, using only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- B O _ _ E: BOUND (N ruled out), BOLGE (G allowed, but BOLGE is rare), BOWNE (N ruled out)
- D O _ _ E: DOLCE (C ruled out), DOWNE (archaic), DOLPH (not a word)
- F O _ _ E: FOLKE (E is 5th, but FOLKE is not common), FOGIE (I ruled out)
- G O _ _ E: GONZE (Z allowed), GOLFE (E is 5th), GONER (N ruled out)
- H O _ _ E: HOMER (R ruled out), HONEY (N ruled out)
- L O _ _ E: LODEA (A ruled out), LONEE (not a word)
- T O _ _ E: TONNE (N ruled out), TOLKE (not a word)
- W O _ _ E: WOMBE (not a word)

Looking through these, the most promising valid word seems to be GONZE (G, O, N, Z, E) but N is ruled out.  
Next, GOLFE (G, O, L, F, E) - all letters are allowed (G, O, L, F, E).  
This appears to be a valid word fitting the pattern and constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is GOLFE.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any letters, to test as many different letters as possible. 

A good choice is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This should give me good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (✓) → last letter is E

So the secret word ends with E, has an O somewhere in positions 1-4, and does NOT contain A, R, or S.

Good letters to test next: T, N, I, L, C, D, U, M, P, etc.  
I want a word that keeps the confirmed E in place, places the O in a new spot, and introduces several new common letters.  
Candidate: “POINT” – but P isn’t tested yet and I is good, but N and T are also useful.  
Better: “UNTIE” – but repeats no letters and keeps E at the end.  
Actually, “UNTIE” has I in the 4th spot and E fixed at 5th, but O isn’t tested.  
Wait, I need to test O in a different position.  

Let’s try “TONER” – but R is already ruled out.  
How about “COVEY”? C, O, V, E, Y – but Y is less common.  
“DOING” – D, O, I, N, G – all new letters, O in 2nd position, E isn’t used here.  
But E must be in 5th.  

So “DOING” is invalid because it doesn’t keep E in 5th.  
Correct form: must have E as last letter, include O somewhere else, and avoid A, R, S.  

“OCEAN” – but A is ruled out.  
“VOICE” – V, O, I, C, E – all new letters except E, and O is in 2nd position.  
This seems good: tests V, O, I, C while keeping E fixed.  

But “VOICE” has O in 2nd, E in 5th – satisfies constraints.  
Another check: no A, R, S – correct.  
“VOICE” is valid 5-letter word.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - A, R, S are not in the word at all.

2. VOICE → V(x) O(✓) I(x) C(x) E(✓)
   - E is again confirmed in position 5.
   - O is now confirmed in position 2.
   - V, I, C are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ E
- Letters ruled out: A, R, S, V, I, C
- Still usable common letters: T, N, L, D, U, M, P, G, H, B, F, K, Y, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2
- E in position 5
- No A, R, S, V, I, C

Good candidates:
- B O _ _ E: BOUND, BOGIE (but I is out), BONZE
- D O _ _ E: DOLCE (C is out), DOWNE
- F O _ _ E: FOLDE (not a word), FUDGE
- G O _ _ E: GOLDE (not a word), GONZE
- H O _ _ E: HOMER (R is out), HONEY
- L O _ _ E: LONEE (not a word), LODEA (A is out)
- M O _ _ E: MONEY, MONGE (not a word)
- N O _ _ E: NONE (N is out), NODGE

- T O _ _ E: TONNE (N is out), TOLNE (not a word), TOGAE (A is out)
- W O _ _ E: WOMBE (not a word)

Best valid options: MONEY, HONEY, POGUE, BOUND, GONZE (but GONZE is less common), BOGIE (I is out), etc.

MONEY seems like the most common word fitting _ O _ _ E:
- M, N, E, Y are all allowed (E and Y not yet ruled out)
- O is in position 2
- E is in position 5

Guess 3: MONEY -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. VOICE → V(x) O(✓) I(x) C(x) E(✓)
   - O is now confirmed in position 2.
   - E is again confirmed in position 5.
   - V, I, C are not in the word.

3. MONEY → M(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)
   - O is confirmed in position 2 (already known).
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.  
     This directly contradicts the earlier feedback that E is in position 5 (✓).  
     Therefore, the feedback must be interpreted as:  
     - E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (because the symbol was “-”).  
     - This means the earlier interpretation was wrong: the E in MONEY was marked “-”, not “✓”.  
     - So the secret word does NOT have E in position 5.  
     - We must re-examine all feedback.

Re-evaluating carefully:

- Guess 1 AROSE: E(✓) → E is in position 5.
- Guess 2 VOICE: E(✓) → E is in position 5.
- Guess 3 MONEY: E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

These two statements are contradictory. The only consistent interpretation is that the feedback for MONEY’s E was a typo, and it should be “-” (wrong position), meaning E is NOT in position 5. Therefore, the earlier feedback that E is in position 5 must be incorrect. The correct understanding is:

- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- O is confirmed in position 2.
- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, V, I, C, M, N, Y.

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ _  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Z  
Common letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, T, U, W

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2
- E somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4 (since it can’t be 5)
- No A, R, S, V, I, C, M, N, Y

Possible structures:  
- E O _ _ _  (but O is already in position 2, so E can’t be there)  
- _ O E _ _  
- _ O _ E _

Let’s list possible words:

- BOUND – B, O, U, N, D → N is ruled out.  
- BOGEY – B, O, G, E, Y → Y is ruled out.  
- DOGEY – D, O, G, E, Y → Y ruled out.  
- POGUE – P, O, G, U, E → all letters allowed (P, O, G, U, E)  
- FOGUE – F, O, G, U, E → all allowed  
- HOGUE – H, O, G, U, E → all allowed  
- TONER – T, O, N, E, R → N and R ruled out.  
- LODEA – A ruled out.  
- GONER – G, O, N, E, R → N and R ruled out.  

Best valid option: POGUE (P, O, G, U, E) – all letters are allowed by current constraints.

So the next guess is POGUE.

Let's carefully re-examine all feedback step by step.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is in position 5.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. VOICE → V(x) O(✓) I(x) C(x) E(✓)
   - O is in position 2.
   - E is in position 5.
   - V, I, C are not in the word.

3. MONEY → M(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)
   - O is in position 2 (confirmed).
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.  
     This directly contradicts the earlier feedback that E is in position 5 (✓).  
     Therefore, the feedback for MONEY must have been mis-recorded.  
     The correct interpretation is: E(-) means E is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
     So we now know:
     - The word does NOT have E in position 5.
     - The word DOES have E somewhere, but not in position 5.
     - Letters ruled out: A, R, S, V, I, C, M, N, Y.

4. POGUE → P(x) O(✓) G(-) U(x) E(✓)
   - O is in position 2 (confirmed).
   - E is in position 5 (✓).  
     This now re-confirms that E is in position 5, resolving the contradiction.  
     So the earlier feedback for MONEY must have been a typo; the E should have been (✓) not (-).  
     Therefore, the word has:
     - O in position 2.
     - E in position 5.
     - Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, V, I, C, M, N, Y, P, U.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ E
- Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, T, W, X, Z
- Common letters among these: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, T, W

We need a 5-letter word with O in position 2 and E in position 5, using only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- B O _ _ E: BOUND (N ruled out), BOLGE (G allowed, but BOLGE is rare), BOWNE (N ruled out)
- D O _ _ E: DOLCE (C ruled out), DOWNE (archaic), DOLPH (not a word)
- F O _ _ E: FOLKE (E is 5th, but FOLKE is not common), FOGIE (I ruled out)
- G O _ _ E: GONZE (Z allowed), GOLFE (E is 5th), GONER (N ruled out)
- H O _ _ E: HOMER (R ruled out), HONEY (N ruled out)
- L O _ _ E: LODEA (A ruled out), LONEE (not a word)
- T O _ _ E: TONNE (N ruled out), TOLKE (not a word)
- W O _ _ E: WOMBE (not a word)

Looking through these, the most promising valid word seems to be GONZE (G, O, N, Z, E) but N is ruled out.  
Next, GOLFE (G, O, L, F, E) - all letters are allowed (G, O, L, F, E).  
This appears to be a valid word fitting the pattern and constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is GOLFE.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)

2. VOICE → V(x) O(✓) I(x) C(x) E(✓)
   - O is in position 2.
   - E is in position 5.
   - V, I, C are not in the word.

3. MONEY → M(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)

   - E is in the word but not in position 5.  
     This contradicts earlier feedback, but the only way to resolve it is to realize the feedback for MONEY must have been mis-recorded.  
     The correct interpretation is: E(-) means E is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
     Therefore, the earlier feedback that E is in position 5 (from AROSE and VOICE) must be correct, and the (-) in MONEY is a typo.  
     So we now know:
     - E is in position 5.
     - O is in position 2.
     - Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, V, I, C, M, N, Y, L, F.

4. POGUE → P(x) O(✓) G(-) U(x) E(✓)
   - O is in position 2 (confirmed).
   - E is in position 5 (confirmed).
   - P, U are not in the word.
   - G(-) means G is in the word but not in position 3.

5. GOLFE → G(-) O(✓) L(x) F(x) E(✓)
   - O is in position 2 (confirmed).
   - E is in position 5 (confirmed).
   - L, F are not in the word.
   - G(-) means G is in the word but not in position 1.

So the word has:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ E
- Must contain G, but G cannot be in position 1 or 3.
- Letters not allowed: A, R, S, V, I, C, M, N, Y, L, F, P, U.

Allowed letters left: B, D, H, J, K, Q, T, W, X, Z, G, O, E.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2
- E in position 5
- G somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since it can't be 1 or 2)
- Other letters from the allowed set.

Possible structures:
- _ O G _ E
- _ O _ G E

Looking for valid words:
- B O G _ E: BOGIE (I ruled out), BOGSE (S ruled out)
- D O G _ E: DOGME (not a word), DOGIE (I ruled out)
- H O G _ E: HOGEN (not a word), HOGSE (S ruled out)

- K O G _ E: KOGIE (I ruled out)
- T O G _ E: TOGAE (A ruled out), TOGUE (U ruled out)
- W O G _ E: WOGIE (I ruled out)
- X O G _ E: XOGEE (not a word)
- Z O G _ E: ZOGIC (I, C ruled out)

Looking at the second structure _ O _ G E:
- B O _ G E: BONGE (N ruled out), BOUGE (U ruled out)
- D O _ G E: DOLGE (L ruled out), DOGGE (G repeated, but valid word ""DOGGE"" exists, though rare)
- H O _ G E: HOMGE (M ruled out), HOGGE (G repeated, valid)
- T O _ G E: TONGE (valid word ""TONGE"" - a type of tree)
- W O _ G E: WONGE (valid word ""WONGE"" - surname)

Among these, ""TONGE"" and ""WONGE"" are both valid. ""TONGE"" uses T, O, N, G, E - but N is ruled out. ""WONGE"" uses W, O, N, G, E - N is ruled out. 

Looking again, ""DOGGE"" and ""HOGGE"" use G twice, which is allowed but rare. 

However, ""TONGE"" is actually the most straightforward valid word fitting _ O _ G E with allowed letters: T, O, N, G, E - but N is ruled out. 

Wait, let's check ""TONGE"" - N is ruled out (from MONEY feedback). 

Next, ""BONGE"" - N ruled out. 

Looking back at the first structure _ O G _ E:
- ""DOGME"" is not a word.
- ""BOGSE"" - S ruled out.
- ""HOGSE"" - S ruled out.

Hmm, seems limited. 

But ""TONGE"" is actually the only common word left. Let me verify:
- T, O, N, G, E - N is ruled out (from MONEY: N(x)). 

Next possible: ""WOGIE"" - I ruled out. 

""WONGE"" - N ruled out. 

""BOGIE"" - I ruled out. 

""DOGIE"" - I ruled out. 

""HOGIE"" - I ruled out. 

""XOGEE"" - not a word. 

""ZOGIC"" - I, C ruled out. 

""BOGGE"" - valid word (variant spelling of ""bogue""), but G is in position 3 which is allowed. 

""BOGGE"" uses B, O, G, G, E - all letters are allowed (B, O, G, E). 

This seems the best remaining option.

Therefore, the next guess is ""BOGGE"".

- ""HOGSE"" - S ruled out.

Hmm, seems limited. 

But ""TONGE"" is actually the only common word left. Let me verify:
- T, O, N, G, E - N is ruled out (from MONEY: N(x)). 

Next possible: ""WOGIE"" - I ruled out. 

""WONGE"" - N ruled out. 

""BOGIE"" - I ruled out. 

""DOGIE"" - I ruled out. 

""HOGIE"" - I ruled out. 

""XOGEE"" - not a word. 

""ZOGIC"" - I, C ruled out. 

""BOGGE"" - valid word (variant spelling of ""bogue""), but G is in position 3 which is allowed. 

""BOGGE"" uses B, O, G, G, E - all letters are allowed (B, O, G, E). 

This seems the best remaining option.

Therefore, the next guess is ""BOGGE"".",Guess 6: BOGGE -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(✓) G(-) G(✓) E(✓),FAIL
