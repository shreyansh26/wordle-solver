### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover these common letters.

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it covers three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for the first guess.

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

From the feedback on RAISE:

Good letters to keep: A, E (already fixed at position 5)

A good next guess should place A in a new position and introduce new common consonants. Let’s try:

- C (from GLACE)

The fourth letter must be a consonant that has not appeared yet and still forms a valid word.  
Remaining common consonants: B, F, H, K, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible 5-letter words fitting G L A _ E:
- GLAVE (archaic sword, but valid)
- GLANE (invalid)
- GLAME (invalid)
- GLAPE (invalid)
- GLIDE (invalid - I eliminated)
- GLIDE (invalid - I eliminated)
- GLUME (invalid)
- GLYME (invalid)

The only valid word left is GLAVE, which uses B - a consonant not yet tested.

Let’s try GLAVE.

We now know the exact pattern: G L A _ E and have eliminated:
- D, R, C, V from being in the 4th position.

Remaining common consonants that have not been used yet and could fit:
B, F, H, K, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.

Valid 5-letter English words that fit G L A _ E:
- GLAZE (Z is possible, though less common)
- GLIDE (I eliminated)
- GLUME (invalid)
- GLYNE (invalid)

The only remaining valid word is GLAZE. Since Z hasn't been ruled out, this must be the word.
