For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use some of these letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it uses S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. Another good option is ""AROSE"" (A, R, O, S, E). 

Between these, ""AROSE"" has slightly better letter coverage with A, R, O, S, E - all in high frequency. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives us good coverage of common vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:

So we know:

2. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has an A somewhere (positions 2-5).
- Does NOT have R, O, S, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed and O, E are ruled out).

A strong candidate is “PLANT”:
- Contains A (position 3).
- Uses P, L, N, T which are all high-frequency letters not yet eliminated.
- No R, O, S, E.

Another candidate is “CHANT”:
- Contains A (position 2).
- Uses C, H, N, T.

- Allowed letters remaining: B, D, F, G, I, K, U, V, W, Y

We need a 5-letter word with:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use some of these letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it uses S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. Another good option is ""AROSE"" (A, R, O, S, E). 

Between these, ""AROSE"" has slightly better letter coverage with A, R, O, S, E - all in high frequency. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives us good coverage of common vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x) → R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains an A, but not in position 1.
2. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has an A somewhere (positions 2-5).
- Does NOT have R, O, S, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed and O, E are ruled out).

A strong candidate is “PLANT”:
- Contains A (position 3).
- Uses P, L, N, T which are all high-frequency letters not yet eliminated.
- No R, O, S, E.

Another candidate is “CHANT”:
- Contains A (position 2).
- Uses C, H, N, T.

I’ll go with PLANT as it has a good mix of consonants and the confirmed vowel A.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(-)
   - P, L, N are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (it was in position 3 in PLANT).
   - T is in the word but not in position 5.

So we now know:
- The word contains A and T.
- A is not in positions 1 or 3.
- T is not in position 5.
- Forbidden letters so far: R, O, S, E, P, L, N.

Remaining common letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A and T.
- A is in position 2, 4, or 5.
- T is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- CATCH: C, A, T, C, H → C, H allowed; A in 2, T in 3 → valid.
- MATCH: M, A, T, C, H → same as above.
- DAITH: D, A, I, T, H → A in 2, T in 4 → valid.
- HATCH: H, A, T, C, H → valid.

Let's consolidate all the information we have so far.

Letters we know are in the word:
- A (position 2)
- C (position 3)
- T (somewhere, but NOT in positions 1, 3, 5)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
R, O, S, E, P, L, N, M, H, K, Y

Forbidden positions:
- T cannot be in 1, 3, 5 → possible positions for T: 2, 4
- Position 2 is already A → therefore T must be in position 4.

So the word structure is:
_ A C T _

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern ? A C T ? and uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, I, U, V, W, plus the already-used A, C, T.

Candidate words:
- BACT? – no common 5-letter words.
- DACT? – DACTY? (not valid), DACTA? (not valid).
- F A C T ? – FACET (but E is out), FACED (E out), FACTS (S out), FACTOR (R out).
- G A C T ? – GACT? – no valid words.
- V A C T ? – VACT? – no valid words.
- W A C T ? – WACT? – no valid words.
- I A C T ? – IACT? – no valid words.
- U A C T ? – UACT? – no valid words.
- B A C T ? – BACT? – no valid words.
- D A C T ? – DACT? – no valid words.
- F A C T ? – FACET (E out), etc.
- G A C T ? – no valid words.
- V A C T ? – no valid words.
- W A C T ? – no valid words.

Wait, let's think differently: the last letter (position 5) can be any letter not yet eliminated. The pattern is _ A C T _.

Looking at the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, U, V, W.

Possible words:
- B A C T ? – BACT? – no valid 5-letter word.
- D A C T ? – DACT? – no valid word.
- F A C T ? – FACET (E is out), FACED (E out), FACTS (S out), FACTOR (R out), FACIA (A already used twice?).
- G A C T ? – GACT? – no valid word.
- V A C T ? – VACT? – no valid word.
- W A C T ? – WACT? – no valid word.
- I A C T ? – IACT? – no valid word.
- U A C T ? – UACT? – no valid word.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Did I miss any?

Wait, let's try ""FACT"" plus a letter. The only valid word fitting _ A C T _ with these constraints is ""FACT"" plus a letter not yet eliminated. But the last letter must be from B, D, F, G, I, U, V, W.

Looking at ""FACT"" plus a letter:
- FACTB – invalid
- FACTD – invalid
- FACTF – invalid
- FACTG – invalid
- FACTI – invalid
- FACTU – invalid
- FACTV – invalid
- FACTW – invalid

This suggests I might have made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback.

From TACKY:
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 1 (already knew it's not in 1,3,5)
- A(✓) – A is in position 2
- C(✓) – C is in position 3
- K(x) – K is out
- Y(x) – Y is out

So the word is _ A C T _ with T in position 4.

Valid 5-letter words fitting _ A C T _:
- B A C T ? – none
- C A C T ? – CACT? – CACTI (but I is allowed), but C is already in position 3, so CACTI would have C in 1 and 3 – but we don't know if C can repeat. The rules don't forbid repeats, but we have no evidence C repeats yet.
- D A C T ? – none
- F A C T ? – none
- G A C T ? – none
- V A C T ? – none
- W A C T ? – none
- I A C T ? – none
- U A C T ? – none

Actually, ""CACTI"" is a valid word meaning cactus (plural). It fits:
- C in 1 (new position for C)
- A in 2
- C in 3
- T in 4
- I in 5 (I is allowed)

This uses all known constraints and introduces I to test if I is in the word.

So the next guess is CACTI.
</think>

Based on the feedback, we now know:
- The word is _ A C T _ (A in position 2, C in position 3, T in position 4)
- Forbidden letters: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, M, H, K, Y
- Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 5: B, D, F, G, I, U, V, W

The only valid 5-letter word fitting this exact pattern is ""CACTI"" (a plural noun meaning cacti), which places C in position 1 (new test for C) and I in position 5 (new letter).

<guess>CACTI</guess>",CACTI,"Let's consolidate all the information we have so far.

Letters we know are in the word:
- A (position 2)
- C (position 3)
- T (somewhere, but NOT in positions 1, 3, 5)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
R, O, S, E, P, L, N, M, H, K, Y

Forbidden positions:
- T cannot be in 1, 3, 5 → possible positions for T: 2, 4
- Position 2 is already A → therefore T must be in position 4.

So the word structure is:
_ A C T _

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern ? A C T ? and uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, I, U, V, W, plus the already-used A, C, T.

Candidate words:
- BACT? – no common 5-letter words.
- DACT? – DACTY? (not valid), DACTA? (not valid).
- F A C T ? – FACET (but E is out), FACED (E out), FACTS (S out), FACTOR (R out).
- G A C T ? – GACT? – no valid words.
- V A C T ? – VACT? – no valid words.
- W A C T ? – WACT? – no valid words.
- I A C T ? – IACT? – no valid words.
- U A C T ? – UACT? – no valid words.
- B A C T ? – BACT? – no valid words.
- D A C T ? – DACT? – no valid words.
- F A C T ? – FACET (E out), etc.
- G A C T ? – no valid words.
- V A C T ? – no valid words.
- W A C T ? – no valid words.

Wait, let's think differently: the last letter (position 5) can be any letter not yet eliminated. The pattern is _ A C T _.

Looking at the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, U, V, W.

Possible words:
- B A C T ? – BACT? – no valid 5-letter word.
- D A C T ? – DACT? – no valid word.
- F A C T ? – FACET (E is out), FACED (E out), FACTS (S out), FACTOR (R out), FACIA (A already used twice?).
- G A C T ? – GACT? – no valid word.
- V A C T ? – VACT? – no valid word.
- W A C T ? – WACT? – no valid word.
- I A C T ? – IACT? – no valid word.
- U A C T ? – UACT? – no valid word.
