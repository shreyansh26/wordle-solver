### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- All 5 common vowels (A, O, E)
- Common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters

This gives me maximum information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, but not in position 1.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses A somewhere other than the first position.
- Avoids R, O, S, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is confirmed and O, E are ruled out).

I’ll try a word that mixes common consonants and the confirmed A in a new position. ""PLAID"" comes to mind, but D is less common. ""UNTIL"" uses U and I, but lacks A. ""BLOAT"" uses A and common letters but O is ruled out. 

A better choice is ""TAINT"" - it has A in position 2, uses common consonants T and N, and introduces I as a new vowel. This should help narrow down possibilities.

From the new feedback on T A I N T:

1. T(✓) – first letter is T.
2. A(✓) – second letter is A.
3. I(x) – I is not in the word.
4. N(✓) – fourth letter is N.
5. T(-) – last letter is T but in the wrong position (it’s actually in position 1, so this confirms T is only once and already placed).

So the pattern so far is:
T A _ N _

Letters ruled out so far: R, O, S, E, I.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, Z.
Remaining vowels: U (since A is used and E, O, I are ruled out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with T A _ N _
- Uses only remaining letters (no R, O, S, E, I)
- Common letters to maximize information.

Possible letters for position 3: common consonants like L, M, C, D, etc.
Possible letters for position 5: common consonants or U.

Looking at common words:
- T A L N _ – “TALON” but O is ruled out.
- T A C N _ – “TACAN” is not a valid word.
- T A D N _ – “TADON” is not valid.
- T A L N _ – “TALON” invalid due to O.
- T A U N _ – “TAUN_” – “TAUNT” is valid but uses U and T, and T is already used in position 1 and 5 (but feedback says T is only once, so 5th letter can’t be T). So “TAUNT” is invalid because T is already in position 1 and feedback says T is only once.

Wait, feedback says T is in position 1 (✓) and also in position 5 (-), but the (-) means it’s in the word but wrong position. This seems contradictory because T is already confirmed in position 1. This must mean T appears only once and is correctly placed in position 1, so position 5 cannot be T. Therefore, “TAUNT” is invalid.

Next possibility: T A _ N _ with remaining letters. Let’s try T A L N _ – no valid word. T A C N _ – no. T A D N _ – no. T A H N _ – “TAHN_” – no. T A M N _ – “TAMAN” is not valid. T A P N _ – “TAPEN” is not valid. T A U N _ – “TAUN_” – “TAUNK” is not valid. 

Wait, maybe T A _ N _ with a consonant in position 3 and U in position 5? T A _ N U. Possible letters for position 3: common consonants. T A L N U – “TALNU” is not valid. T A C N U – “TACNU” is not valid. T A D N U – “TADNU” is not valid. T A H N U – “TAHNU” is not valid. T A M N U – “TAMNU” is not valid. T A P N U – “TAPNU” is not valid. 

Hmm, maybe I need to reconsider. Let’s list valid 5-letter words starting with T A _ N _ without R, O, S, E, I:

- T A _ N _ – possible words: “TACAN” (invalid), “TADON” (invalid), “TAHAN” (invalid), “TALON” (invalid), “TAMAN” (invalid), “TAPON” (invalid), “TANGI” (invalid), “TANIC” (invalid), “TANKS” (invalid), “TANGO” (invalid), “TAPEN” (invalid), “TAROC” (invalid), “TARPS” (invalid), “TARTS” (invalid), “TASER” (invalid), “TATOU” (invalid), “TAUNT” (invalid), “TAUON” (invalid), “TAWNY” (invalid), “TAXES” (invalid), “TAZER” (invalid).

This is tricky. Maybe the word is “TALON” but O is ruled out. “TACAN” is not valid. “TAHAN” is not valid. “TAMAN” is not valid. “TAPON” is not valid. 

Wait, let’s check “TAWNY” – starts with T A, has W, N, Y – but W is less common. “TAWNY” is valid. Let me see: T A W N Y – letters: T, A, W, N, Y. None of these are ruled out except I, R, O, S, E. So this could be possible.

Another option: “TAXON” – but O is ruled out. “TAJIN” – but I is ruled out.
