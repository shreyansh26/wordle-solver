For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word early on.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a slightly better letter frequency distribution according to Wordle analysis.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

- Contains the letter S somewhere (but not in position 4).

1. Has S in a position other than 4.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, V, W, Y, K, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, U (since A, O, E are ruled out).

I’ll look for a word that mixes these. Some candidates:
- STUNS (but uses N twice and S twice, not ideal)
- STINT (uses I, T, N)
- SLINK (uses I, N, K)
- SWUNG (uses W, U, N, G)

""STINT"" seems good: S in position 1 (new position), I (new vowel), T, N (common consonants). It avoids all ruled-out letters.

Another check: S is allowed anywhere except position 4, and here it’s in position 1. Good.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word early on.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters.

Guess 2: STINT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) I(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>

From the new feedback on STINT:
- S is now confirmed in position 1 (✓).
- T is not in the word (x).
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- N is not in the word (x).
- Second T is not in the word (x).

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains I but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, T, N.

Remaining common letters to try: D, L, C, G, B, F, V, W, Y, K, M, P, H, U, etc.
Vowels left: I, U (A, O, E ruled out).

I need a word starting with S, containing I not in position 3, and avoiding all ruled-out letters.

Possible patterns:
- S _ _ I _ (I in position 4)
- S _ I _ _ (I in position 3 - but this is ruled out)
- S I _ _ _ (I in position 2)

Let’s try S I _ _ _ (I in position 2) with common consonants:
- S I D D L (not a valid word)
- S I D G E (invalid, has E)
- S I D L Y (valid word: SIDLY - but uncommon)
- S I G H T (invalid, has T)
- S I G H N (invalid, has N)
- S I G H T (invalid)
- S I G H (needs 5 letters)

Wait, let’s think of better words:
- S I D L Y is valid but rare.
- S I G H T is invalid (has T).
- S I G H N is invalid (has N).
- S I G H is 4 letters.

Alternative: S _ _ I _ (I in position 4):
- S L U I D (valid: SLUID - but rare)
- S L I D E (invalid, has E)
- S L I G H (invalid, has H but position 4 is G)
- S L I V E (invalid, has E)
- S L I V A (invalid, has A)
- S L I V E (invalid)
- S L I V E (invalid)

Another approach: use common consonants in positions 3 and 5:
- S I D D Y (valid: SIDDY - but rare)
- S I D L Y (valid but rare)
- S I G G Y (valid: SIGGY - but rare)
- S I V Y (needs consonant)

Looking for common words:
- S I D D Y is possible but uncommon.
- S I D L Y is possible.
- S I G H T is invalid (has T).
- S I G H N is invalid (has N).

Wait, let’s try S I D L Y (SIDLY) - it’s a valid word meaning a small stream or brook. It uses:
- S (position 1 ✓)
- I (position 2 - allowed since I is in word but position 3 is ruled out, position 2 is fine)
- D, L, Y - all new letters not ruled out.

This seems like the best next guess.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word (x feedback):
   A, R, O, E, T, N, D, L, Y

2. Letters that ARE in the word (– or ✓ feedback):
   - S is fixed in position 1 (✓ from STINT and SIDLY).
   - I is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (– from STINT and SIDLY).  
     Therefore I must be in position 4 or 5.

3. Remaining unused common letters:
   Consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Z  
   Vowels: U (only one vowel left)

4. Pattern so far:
   S _ _ I _   (I in position 4)  
   or  
   S _ _ _ I   (I in position 5)

5. We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
   - Starts with S
   - Contains I in position 4 or 5
   - Uses only letters not ruled out

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word early on.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a slightly better letter frequency distribution according to Wordle analysis.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter S somewhere (but not in position 4).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in a position other than 4.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, V, W, Y, K, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, U (since A, O, E are ruled out).

I’ll look for a word that mixes these. Some candidates:
- STUNS (but uses N twice and S twice, not ideal)
- STINT (uses I, T, N)
- SLINK (uses I, N, K)
- SWUNG (uses W, U, N, G)

""STINT"" seems good: S in position 1 (new position), I (new vowel), T, N (common consonants). It avoids all ruled-out letters.

Another check: S is allowed anywhere except position 4, and here it’s in position 1. Good.

So I’ll guess STINT.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STINT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) I(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on STINT:
- S is now confirmed in position 1 (✓).
- T is not in the word (x).
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- N is not in the word (x).
- Second T is not in the word (x).

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains I but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, T, N.

Remaining common letters to try: D, L, C, G, B, F, V, W, Y, K, M, P, H, U, etc.
Vowels left: I, U (A, O, E ruled out).

I need a word starting with S, containing I not in position 3, and avoiding all ruled-out letters.

Possible patterns:
- S _ _ I _ (I in position 4)
- S _ I _ _ (I in position 3 - but this is ruled out)
- S I _ _ _ (I in position 2)

Let’s try S I _ _ _ (I in position 2) with common consonants:
- S I D D L (not a valid word)
- S I D G E (invalid, has E)
- S I D L Y (valid word: SIDLY - but uncommon)
- S I G H T (invalid, has T)
- S I G H N (invalid, has N)
- S I G H T (invalid)
- S I G H (needs 5 letters)

Wait, let’s think of better words:
- S I D L Y is valid but rare.
- S I G H T is invalid (has T).
- S I G H N is invalid (has N).
- S I G H is 4 letters.

Alternative: S _ _ I _ (I in position 4):
- S L U I D (valid: SLUID - but rare)
- S L I D E (invalid, has E)
- S L I G H (invalid, has H but position 4 is G)
- S L I V E (invalid, has E)
- S L I V A (invalid, has A)
- S L I V E (invalid)
- S L I V E (invalid)

Another approach: use common consonants in positions 3 and 5:
- S I D D Y (valid: SIDDY - but rare)
- S I D L Y (valid but rare)
- S I G G Y (valid: SIGGY - but rare)
- S I V Y (needs consonant)

Looking for common words:
- S I D D Y is possible but uncommon.
- S I D L Y is possible.
- S I G H T is invalid (has T).
- S I G H N is invalid (has N).

Wait, let’s try S I D L Y (SIDLY) - it’s a valid word meaning a small stream or brook. It uses:
- S (position 1 ✓)
- I (position 2 - allowed since I is in word but position 3 is ruled out, position 2 is fine)
- D, L, Y - all new letters not ruled out.

This seems like the best next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word early on.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a slightly better letter frequency distribution according to Wordle analysis.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter S somewhere (but not in position 4).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in a position other than 4.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, V, W, Y, K, etc.
Good vowels to try next: I, U (since A, O, E are ruled out).

I’ll look for a word that mixes these. Some candidates:
- STUNS (but uses N twice and S twice, not ideal)
- STINT (uses I, T, N)
- SLINK (uses I, N, K)
- SWUNG (uses W, U, N, G)

""STINT"" seems good: S in position 1 (new position), I (new vowel), T, N (common consonants). It avoids all ruled-out letters.

Another check: S is allowed anywhere except position 4, and here it’s in position 1. Good.

So I’ll guess STINT.

Guess 2: STINT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) I(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on STINT:
- S is now confirmed in position 1 (✓).
- T is not in the word (x).
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- N is not in the word (x).
- Second T is not in the word (x).

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains I but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, T, N.

Remaining common letters to try: D, L, C, G, B, F, V, W, Y, K, M, P, H, U, etc.
Vowels left: I, U (A, O, E ruled out).

I need a word starting with S, containing I not in position 3, and avoiding all ruled-out letters.

Possible patterns:
- S _ _ I _ (I in position 4)
- S _ I _ _ (I in position 3 - but this is ruled out)
- S I _ _ _ (I in position 2)

Let’s try S I _ _ _ (I in position 2) with common consonants:
- S I D D L (not a valid word)
- S I D G E (invalid, has E)
- S I D L Y (valid word: SIDLY - but uncommon)
- S I G H T (invalid, has T)
- S I G H N (invalid, has N)
- S I G H T (invalid)
- S I G H (needs 5 letters)

Wait, let’s think of better words:
- S I D L Y is valid but rare.
- S I G H T is invalid (has T).
- S I G H N is invalid (has N).
- S I G H is 4 letters.

Alternative: S _ _ I _ (I in position 4):
- S L U I D (valid: SLUID - but rare)
- S L I D E (invalid, has E)
- S L I G H (invalid, has H but position 4 is G)
- S L I V E (invalid, has E)
- S L I V A (invalid, has A)
- S L I V E (invalid)
- S L I V E (invalid)

Another approach: use common consonants in positions 3 and 5:
- S I D D Y (valid: SIDDY - but rare)
- S I D L Y (valid but rare)
- S I G G Y (valid: SIGGY - but rare)
- S I V Y (needs consonant)

Looking for common words:
- S I D D Y is possible but uncommon.
- S I D L Y is possible.
- S I G H T is invalid (has T).
- S I G H N is invalid (has N).

Wait, let’s try S I D L Y (SIDLY) - it’s a valid word meaning a small stream or brook. It uses:
- S (position 1 ✓)
- I (position 2 - allowed since I is in word but position 3 is ruled out, position 2 is fine)
- D, L, Y - all new letters not ruled out.

This seems like the best next guess.

From the new feedback on SPICK:

- S(✓) – S is still correct in position 1.  
- P(x), C(x), K(x) – none of P, C, K appear anywhere in the word.  
- I(-) – I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (it was “-” again, so it must be in 4).  

So the pattern is now:  
S _ _ I _  
Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, E, T, N, D, L, Y, P, C, K.  
Remaining common consonants: B, F, G, H, M, V, W, U, etc.  

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with S, has I in position 4, and only uses the allowed letters.  

Candidate words fitting S _ _ I _:
- S B I G _ – no valid 5-letter word.  
- S F I G _ – SFING (invalid).  
- S H I F _ – SHIF (4 letters).  
- S H I V _ – SHIV (4 letters).  
- S H I N _ – SHINE (N forbidden).  
- S H I L _ – SHIL (invalid).  
- S M I L _ – SMILE (L forbidden).  
- S M I L E – SMILE (E forbidden).  
- S W I F _ – SWIFT (T forbidden).  
- S W I N _ – SWING (N forbidden).  
- S W I L _ – SWIL (invalid).  
- S G I F _ – SGIF (invalid).  

Looking through remaining possibilities, the only common valid word left is:

- S H I F T – but T is forbidden.  
- S H I F T – invalid.
