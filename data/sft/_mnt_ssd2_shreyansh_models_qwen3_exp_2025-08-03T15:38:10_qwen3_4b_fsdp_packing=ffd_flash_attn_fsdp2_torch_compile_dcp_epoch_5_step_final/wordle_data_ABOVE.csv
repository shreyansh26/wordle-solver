1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives me good coverage of common letters and positions to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is in the word and in the correct final position (✓).

So the secret word ends with E and contains A somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 1 is ruled out by S and L).  
We also know it does NOT contain S, L, or T.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep the confirmed E in position 5.
2. Move A to a new position (2, 3, or 4).
3. Introduce other common consonants not yet ruled out (like R, N, C, H, M, P, etc.).
4. Avoid S, L, T.

A strong candidate is ""CRANE"":

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: S, L, T, C, R, N
2. The word ends with E (position 5 is ✓).
3. The letter A is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (because in both CRANE and SLATE it showed “-” in positions 2 and 3 respectively).  
   Therefore A must be in position 1.

So far the pattern is: A _ _ _ E

We still need three consonants that have not been ruled out.  
Common remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Vowels left: I, O, U (but we already have A and E, so maybe I or O could fit).

A good next guess should:
- Start with A
- End with E
- Introduce several new consonants
- Try to place the remaining vowels (I or O) to see if they fit

One strong candidate is “AMIDE”:
- Starts with A, ends with E
- Uses M, I, D – all new letters
- Tests the vowel I in position 3
- Uses D in position 4

Another candidate is “ABOKE” (but “ABOKE” isn’t a valid English word).  
“ALONE” uses L, already ruled out.  
“AWIDE” isn’t a word.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). \n\nOne of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:\n- S (very common starting letter)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (common vowel)\n- T (common consonant)\n- E (most common letter in English)\n\nThis combination gives me good coverage of common letters and positions to test against the secret word.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n- S, L, T are NOT in the word (x).\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).\n- E is in the word and in the correct final position (✓).\n\nSo the secret word ends with E and contains A somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 1 is ruled out by S and L).  \nWe also know it does NOT contain S, L, or T.\n\nA good second guess should:\n1. Keep the confirmed E in position 5.\n2. Move A to a new position (2, 3, or 4).\n3. Introduce other common consonants not yet ruled out (like R, N, C, H, M, P, etc.).\n4.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, C, R, N, M, I, D
2. The word ends with E (position 5 is ✓).
3. The word starts with A (position 1 is ✓).
4. The letters in positions 2, 3, and 4 must be chosen from the remaining unused letters.

Remaining unused letters (excluding the ones already ruled out):
Consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, V, W, Y, Z
Vowels: O, U (A and E are already used)

We need three letters (positions 2-4) from the remaining pool.  
Since we have only two vowels left (O, U) and many consonants, a good strategy is to test common consonant clusters.

Possible patterns: A _ _ _ E

Let’s try a word that uses common consonants in positions 2-4.  
A strong candidate is “ABOVE”:
- Starts with A, ends with E
- Uses B, O, V – all new letters
- Tests the vowel O in position 3
- Uses B and V (common consonants)

Another candidate is “AWORE” (but that’s not a valid word).  
“AGOUE” is not valid.  
“APHLE” is not valid.  
“ABOVE” seems to be the best valid word.

Let’s go with ABOVE.
