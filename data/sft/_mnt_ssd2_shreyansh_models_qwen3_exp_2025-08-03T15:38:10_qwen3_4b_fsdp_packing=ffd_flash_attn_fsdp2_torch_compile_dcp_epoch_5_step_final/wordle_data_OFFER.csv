From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)

2. TOWER → T(x) O(-) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)

   - Letters not in word: T, W, A, S  
   - E is now confirmed in position 4.  
   - R is confirmed in position 5.  

So we know:
- Position 4 = E  
- Position 5 = R  
- O must appear somewhere in the word (but not in position 3 from AROSE, and not in position 2 from TOWER).  
- Remaining letters must be chosen from the unused pool excluding T, W, A, S.  

Available letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, U, V, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in “ER” that contains O in either position 1 or 3 (since position 2 is ruled out for O).  
- Position 3 is still open for O.  

Let’s try “FOGER”:

But wait—O was ruled out of position 2 in TOWER (feedback O(-) means it’s in the word but not in position 2). So O can still be in position 1 or 3.  

“FOGER” has O in position 2, which is invalid.

- G (new)  
- O (position 2 is allowed, since O was only ruled out of position 2 in TOWER, not globally)  
- N (new)  
- E (position 4)  
- R (position 5)  

This fits all constraints:
- Contains R, O, E in positions 5, 2, 4 respectively.  
- Does not contain T, W, A, S.  
- All letters are valid.  

So “GONER” is a good next guess.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, S, L). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" which contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

Letters we know are in the word: R, O, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, S  

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R, O, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively).
2. Does NOT contain A or S.
3. Uses only remaining common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is out and O/E are already in).

Let’s try “TOWER”:
- T (new letter)
- O (in word, position 2 is allowed since O was in position 3 before)
- W (new letter)
- E (in word, position 4 is allowed since E was in position 5 before)
- R (in word, position 5 is allowed since R was in position 2 before)

This uses three known letters (R, O, E) in new positions and introduces two new letters (T, W) to test.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   - Letters in word: R, O, E  
   - Letters not in word: A, S  

2. TOWER → T(x) O(-) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - Letters in word: R, O, E  
   - Letters not in word: T, W, A, S  
   - E is now confirmed in position 4.  
   - R is confirmed in position 5.  

So we know:
- Position 4 = E  
- Position 5 = R  
- O must appear somewhere in the word (but not in position 3 from AROSE, and not in position 2 from TOWER).  
- Remaining letters must be chosen from the unused pool excluding T, W, A, S.  

Available letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, U, V, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in “ER” that contains O in either position 1 or 3 (since position 2 is ruled out for O).  
- Position 3 is still open for O.  

Let’s try “FOGER”:
- F (new letter)  
- O (in word, position 2 is allowed because O was only ruled out of position 2 in TOWER, not position 3)  
- G (new letter)  
- E (confirmed, position 4)  
- R (confirmed, position 5)  

But wait—O was ruled out of position 2 in TOWER (feedback O(-) means it’s in the word but not in position 2). So O can still be in position 1 or 3.  

“FOGER” has O in position 2, which is invalid.  

Next candidate: “CHORE” – but it ends in E, not R.  

Try “MORER” – but double R is unlikely.  

Try “BORER” – same issue with double R.  

Try “HORER” – again double R.  

Try “GONER”:
- G (new)  
- O (position 2 is allowed, since O was only ruled out of position 2 in TOWER, not globally)  
- N (new)  
- E (position 4)  
- R (position 5)  

This fits all constraints:
- Contains R, O, E in positions 5, 2, 4 respectively.  
- Does not contain T, W, A, S.  
- All letters are valid.  

So “GONER” is a good next guess.

We need a 5-letter English word that starts with O, ends with ER, has E in position 4, and R in position 5, with the middle two letters from the remaining pool.

Actually, the only valid 5-letter word fitting O _ _ E R with the remaining letters is ""OMBER"" but M and B are still possible. However, ""OMBER"" is not a standard English word.

Looking back at the remaining letters: B, C, D, F, H, M, P, U, V, Y

Possible combinations:
- O B _ E R → OMBER (valid word)
- O C _ E R → OCVER (invalid)
- O D _ E R → ODHER (invalid)
- O F _ E R → OFFER (invalid)
- O H _ E R → OHMER (invalid)
- O M _ E R → OMFER (invalid), OMGER (invalid), OMBER (valid)
- O P _ E R → OPHER (invalid)
- O U _ E R → OUSER (invalid)
- O V _ E R → OVVER (invalid)
- O Y _ E R → OYSTER (too long)

""OMBER"" is actually a valid English word (a type of moth), and it uses M and B which are still possible.

So the next guess is ""OMBER"".

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, S, L). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" which contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

Letters we know are in the word: R, O, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, S  

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R, O, E (but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively).
2. Does NOT contain A or S.
3. Uses only remaining common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is out and O/E are already in).

Let’s try “TOWER”:
- T (new letter)
- O (in word, position 2 is allowed since O was in position 3 before)
- W (new letter)
- E (in word, position 4 is allowed since E was in position 5 before)
- R (in word, position 5 is allowed since R was in position 2 before)

This uses three known letters (R, O, E) in new positions and introduces two new letters (T, W) to test.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: TOWER -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(-) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   - Letters in word: R, O, E  
   - Letters not in word: A, S  

2. TOWER → T(x) O(-) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - Letters in word: R, O, E  
   - Letters not in word: T, W, A, S  
   - E is now confirmed in position 4.  
   - R is confirmed in position 5.  

So we know:
- Position 4 = E  
- Position 5 = R  
- O must appear somewhere in the word (but not in position 3 from AROSE, and not in position 2 from TOWER).  
- Remaining letters must be chosen from the unused pool excluding T, W, A, S.  

Available letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, U, V, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in “ER” that contains O in either position 1 or 3 (since position 2 is ruled out for O).  
- Position 3 is still open for O.  

Let’s try “FOGER”:
- F (new letter)  
- O (in word, position 2 is allowed because O was only ruled out of position 2 in TOWER, not position 3)  
- G (new letter)  
- E (confirmed, position 4)  
- R (confirmed, position 5)  

But wait—O was ruled out of position 2 in TOWER (feedback O(-) means it’s in the word but not in position 2). So O can still be in position 1 or 3.  

“FOGER” has O in position 2, which is invalid.  

Next candidate: “CHORE” – but it ends in E, not R.  

Try “MORER” – but double R is unlikely.  

Try “BORER” – same issue with double R.  

Try “HORER” – again double R.  

Try “GONER”:
- G (new)  
- O (position 2 is allowed, since O was only ruled out of position 2 in TOWER, not globally)  
- N (new)  
- E (position 4)  
- R (position 5)  

This fits all constraints:
- Contains R, O, E in positions 5, 2, 4 respectively.  
- Does not contain T, W, A, S.  
- All letters are valid.  

So “GONER” is a good next guess.

So far we know:
- Word ends in ""ER"" (positions 4=E, 5=R)
- O must be in position 1 (since it can't be in 2, 3, 4, or 5)
- Letters used so far: R, O, E, G, N, T, W, A, S

From all five guesses we now know:

Pattern: O _ _ E R  
Positions fixed:  
1 = O, 4 = E, 5 = R  

Letters that must appear somewhere in the word (and have not been ruled out):  
- O (already in position 1)  
- E (already in position 4)  
- R (already in position 5)  

Letters already proven NOT in the word:  
A, S, T, W, G, N, I, L, M, B  

That leaves these still-possible letters for positions 2 and 3:  
C, D, F, H, P, U, V, Y, etc.  

We need a 5-letter English word of the form O _ _ E R using only the remaining letters.  
Valid dictionary words that fit:

- O C _ E R → OCVER (invalid), OCHER (invalid), OCKER (invalid)  
- O D _ E R → ODHER (invalid), ODER? (invalid)  
- O F _ E R → OFFER (invalid)

- O U _ E R → OUSER (invalid)  
- O V _ E R → OVVER (invalid)  
- O Y _ E R → OYSTER (6 letters)  

The only real 5-letter English word left that fits O _ _ E R with the remaining letters is:  
O C H E R  →  “OCHER” (a valid word meaning a yellowish-brown color)

All letters O, C, H, E, R are consistent with every previous clue.
