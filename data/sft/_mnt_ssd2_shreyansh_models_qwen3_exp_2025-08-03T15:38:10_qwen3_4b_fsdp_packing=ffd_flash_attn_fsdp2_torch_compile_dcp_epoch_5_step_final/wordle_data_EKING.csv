For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words

This should give us good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions:  
- N (from UNTIE: N(-))

So the secret word:

- E is not in position 5, N is not in position 2, I is not in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that uses the letters N, I, E plus two other letters that have not been ruled out.  
Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowel: only Y is left as a vowel-like letter; we already excluded A, E, I, O, U.

A good candidate would place E, N, I in new positions and introduce two fresh consonants.  
Let’s try “BEGIN”:
- B and G are new letters.  
- E is in position 1 (allowed).  
- B is new.  
- E appears twice in “BEGIN” but we only know one E exists; this is risky.

- E is not in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from UNTIE, FENCE)  
- N is not in positions 2 or 3 (from UNTIE, FENCE)  
- I is not in position 4 (from UNTIE)

So the word must contain N, I, E exactly once each, and two other letters chosen from the still-allowed consonants: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to place N, I, E in the remaining legal slots and fill the other two slots with fresh consonants.

Let’s list the legal positions for each required letter:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
E: allowed in 1, 3, 5 (cannot be 2,4,5) – actually 1 and 3 only  
N: allowed in 1, 4, 5 (cannot be 2,3)  
I: allowed in 1, 2, 3, 5 (cannot be 4)

We need a valid permutation of N, I, E plus two new consonants that satisfies these constraints.

One systematic way is to pick a candidate that places E in position 1 or 3, N in 4 or 5, and I in 1,2,3,5, while introducing new consonants.

Try placing E in 1, N in 4, I in 2:

E I _ N _

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words

This should give us good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S
- DOES contain E, but not in position 5

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes E (but not in position 5)
2. Excludes A, R, O, S
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good consonants to try now: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, B, F, G, K, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, U (since A, O are out)

I'll choose a word that uses E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4, and includes other common letters not yet tried.

Possible candidates: ""UNTIE"", ""ELITE"", ""ENTRY"", ""EVENT"", ""ETHIC"", etc.

""UNTIE"" uses U, N, T, I, E - all new letters and E is in position 4 (which is allowed since it's not position 5).

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T  
Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions:  
- N (from UNTIE: N(-))  
- I (from UNTIE: I(-))  
- E (from AROSE: E(-))  

So the secret word:
- Contains N, I, E exactly once each.  
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, U, T.  
- E is not in position 5, N is not in position 2, I is not in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that uses the letters N, I, E plus two other letters that have not been ruled out.  
Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowel: only Y is left as a vowel-like letter; we already excluded A, E, I, O, U.

A good candidate would place E, N, I in new positions and introduce two fresh consonants.  
Let’s try “BEGIN”:
- B and G are new letters.  
- E is in position 1 (allowed).  
- B is new.  
- E appears twice in “BEGIN” but we only know one E exists; this is risky.

Instead, try “FENCE”:
- F and C are new.  
- E is in position 4 (allowed).  
- N is in position 3 (allowed).  
- C and F are fresh letters.

This seems safe and informative.

Let’s update the state after the fourth guess.

Letters we have tried so far:  
A, R, O, S, U, T, F, C, V, G, I, E, N  

Letters that are NOT in the word (x feedback):  
A, R, O, S, U, T, F, C, V  

Letters that ARE in the word (at least once) and their position status:  
E – appears in the word, but we have seen it in positions 2,4,5 and always got “-” (wrong position).  
So E cannot be in 2,4,5 → E must be in 1 or 3.  

N – appears in the word, but we have seen it in positions 2,3,5 and always got “-” (wrong position).  
So N cannot be in 2,3,5 → N must be in 1 or 4.  

I – appears in the word, but we have seen it in positions 2,4 and always got “-” (wrong position).  
So I cannot be in 2,4 → I must be in 1,3,5.  

G – appeared in position 1 and got “-” (wrong position), so G is in the word but not in 1.  

So far we know the word contains G, I, N, E (each once) and one more letter that has not been ruled out.  
Letters still allowed: B, D, H, K, L, M, P, W, Y, etc.  

We need a 5-letter word that uses G, I, N, E plus one new consonant, with the positional restrictions above.

Let’s list possible positions for each required letter:

Position 1: cannot be A,R,O,S,U,T,F,C,V,G,I,N,E → allowed: B,D,H,K,L,M,P,W,Y  
Position 2: cannot be A,R,O,S,U,T,F,C,V,I,N,E,G → allowed: B,D,H,K,L,M,P,W,Y  
Position 3: cannot be A,R,O,S,U,T,F,C,V,I,N,E,G → allowed: B,D,H,K,L,M,P,W,Y  
Position 4: cannot be A,R,O,S,U,T,F,C,V,N,I,E,G → allowed: B,D,H,K,L,M,P,W,Y  
Position 5: cannot be A,R,O,S,U,T,F,C,V,I,N,E,G → allowed: B,D,H,K,L,M,P,W,Y  

But we must place G, I, N, E into positions 1-5 with their specific restrictions.

Let’s try to find a valid arrangement.

We have four required letters (G,I,N,E) and one extra consonant.

Let’s try to place them:

Option 1: E in 1, N in 4, I in 3  
E _ I N _

We need a consonant for position 2. Let’s pick B → E B I N _  
We need a 5th letter for position 5. We have already used E,I,N,G. We need a new consonant. Let’s pick D → E B I N D.  
Check:  
- E in 1 (allowed)  
- N in 4 (allowed)  
- I in 3 (allowed)  
- G must be somewhere, but we have not placed G. So this is invalid (we must include G).  

So we need to include G somewhere.

Option 2: E in 1, N in 4, I in 5, G in 2  
E G _ N I  

We need a consonant for position 3. Let’s pick B → E G B N I.  
Check:  
- E in 1 (allowed)  
- G in 2 (allowed)  
- B new  
- N in 4 (allowed)  
- I in 5 (allowed)  
- Contains all required letters (E, N, I, G) and one new consonant (B).  
- Is “EGBNI” a valid English word? No.  

Option 3: E in 1, N in 4, I in 3, G in 5  
E _ I N G  

We need a consonant for position 2. Let’s pick B → E B I N G.  
Check:  
- E in 1 (allowed)  
- B new  
- I in 3 (allowed)  
- N in 4 (allowed)  
- G in 5 (allowed)  
- Contains E, N, I, G and one new consonant (B).  
- “EBING” is not a valid English word.  

Option 4: N in 1, E in 3, I in 5, G in 2  
N G E _ I  

We need a consonant for position 4. Let’s pick B → N G E B I.  
Check:  
- N in 1 (allowed)  
- G in 2 (allowed)  
- E in 3 (allowed)  
- B new  
- I in 5 (allowed)  
- “NGEBI” not a word.  

Option 5: N in 1, E in 3, I in 2, G in 4  
N _ E G I  

We need a consonant for position 2. Let’s pick B → N B E G I.  
Check:  
- N in 1 (allowed)  
- B new  
- E in 3 (allowed)  
- G in 4 (allowed)  
- I in 5 (allowed)  
- “NBEGI” not a word.  

Option 6: E in 3, N in 4, I in 1, G in 2  
I G E N _  

We need a consonant for position 5. Let’s pick B → I G E N B.  
Check:  
- I in 1 (allowed)  
- G in 2 (allowed)  
- E in 3 (allowed)  
- N in 4 (allowed)  
- B new  
- “IGENB” not a word.  

Option 7: E in 3, N in 1, I in 5, G in 2  
N G E _ I  

Same as Option 4, “NGEBI” not a word.  

Option 8: E in 1, N in 4, I in 2, G in 3  
E _ I G N  

We need a consonant for position 2. Let’s pick B → E B I G N.  
Check:  
- E in 1 (allowed)  
- B new  
- I in 2 (allowed)  
- G in 3 (allowed)  
- N in 4 (allowed)  
- “EBIGN” not a word.  

Option 9: E in 3, N in 1, I in 2, G in 5  
N _ E I G  

We need a consonant for position 2. Let’s pick B → N B E I G.  
Check:  
- N in 1 (allowed)  
- B new  
- E in 3 (allowed)  
- I in 4 (allowed)  
- G in 5 (allowed)  
- “NBIEG” not a word.  

Option 10: E in 1, N in 4, I in 2, G in 5  
E _ I _ G  

We need consonants for positions 2 and 3. Let’s pick B and D → E B I D G.  
Check:  
- E in 1 (allowed)  
- B new  
- I in 2 (allowed)  
- D new  
- G in 5 (allowed)  
- “EBIDG” not a word.  

Let’s try a different approach: look for real words that contain G,I,N,E plus one new consonant, respecting the positional restrictions.

Real words with G,I,N,E plus one new consonant:

- “INGEN” – but N is repeated, and we don’t know if letters can repeat. Also, N is in position 3 which is allowed, but this is obscure.  
- “GENIE” – contains G,E,N,I,E → E repeats, and we don’t know if repeats are allowed. Also, E in 5 is forbidden.  
- “ENGIE” – similar issue with E in 5.  
- “WIGEN” – W new, but not a word.  
- “BINGE” – B new, but E in 5 forbidden.  
- “DINGE” – D new, E in 5 forbidden.  
- “KINGE” – K new, E in 5 forbidden.  
- “HINGE” – H new, E in 5 forbidden.  
- “MINGE” – M new, E in 5 forbidden.  
- “PINEG” – P new, E in 5 forbidden.  
- “YINGE” – Y new, E in 5 forbidden.  
- “GIVEN” – already tried, E in 5 forbidden.  
- “GNIPE” – P new, E in 5 forbidden.  
- “INGEN” – obscure, E in 5 forbidden.  
- “KEING” – K new, E in 5 forbidden.  
- “PEIGN” – P new, E in 5 forbidden.  
- “YINGE” – Y new, E in 5 forbidden.

- “MINGE” – M new, E in 5 forbidden.  
- “PINEG” – P new, E in 5 forbidden.  
- “YINGE” – Y new, E in 5 forbidden.  
- “KINGE” – K new, E in 5 forbidden.  
- “WINGE” – W new, E in 5 forbidden.  
- “DINGE” – D new, E in 5 forbidden.  
- “LINGE” – L new, E in 5 forbidden.  
- “ZINGE” – Z new, E in 5 forbidden.  
- “XINGE” – X new, E in 5 forbidden.  
- “QINGE” – Q new, E in 5 forbidden.  
- “JINGE” – J new, E in 5 forbidden.  

Hmm, all these have E in 5 which is forbidden. Let’s look for words where E is in 1 or 3.

Real word: “HINGE” – E in 5 forbidden.  
Real word: “PINEG” – E in 5 forbidden.  
Real word: “BINGE” – E in 5 forbidden.  
Real word: “DINGE” – E in 5 forbidden.  
Real word: “KINGE” – E in 5 forbidden.  
Real word: “LINGE” – E in 5 forbidden.  
Real word: “MINGE” – E in 5 forbidden.  
Real word: “WINGE” – E in 5 forbidden.  
Real word: “YINGE” – E in 5 forbidden.  
Real word: “ZINGE” – E in 5 forbidden.  
Real word: “XINGE” – E in 5 forbidden.  
Real word: “QINGE” – E in 5 forbidden.  
Real word: “JINGE” – E in 5 forbidden.  

Let’s try E in 3.

Real word: “INGEN” – N in 3, E in 3 – but N is in 3 which is allowed for N (restriction was N not in 2,3,5 – wait, from GIVEN we saw N in 5 and 3 both gave “-”, so N is not in 2,3,5 – so N must be in 1 or 4. So N in 3 is actually forbidden.  

Real word: “INGEN” – N in 3 forbidden.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words

This should give us good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S
- DOES contain E, but not in position 5

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes E (but not in position 5)
2. Excludes A, R, O, S
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good consonants to try now: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, B, F, G, K, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, U (since A, O are out)

I'll choose a word that uses E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4, and includes other common letters not yet tried.

Possible candidates: ""UNTIE"", ""ELITE"", ""ENTRY"", ""EVENT"", ""ETHIC"", etc.

""UNTIE"" uses U, N, T, I, E - all new letters and E is in position 4 (which is allowed since it's not position 5).

Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T  
Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions:  
- N (from UNTIE: N(-))  
- I (from UNTIE: I(-))  
- E (from AROSE: E(-))  

So the secret word:
- Contains N, I, E exactly once each.  
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, U, T.  
- E is not in position 5, N is not in position 2, I is not in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that uses the letters N, I, E plus two other letters that have not been ruled out.  
Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowel: only Y is left as a vowel-like letter; we already excluded A, E, I, O, U.

A good candidate would place E, N, I in new positions and introduce two fresh consonants.  
Let’s try “BEGIN”:
- B and G are new letters.  
- E is in position 1 (allowed).  
- B is new.  
- E appears twice in “BEGIN” but we only know one E exists; this is risky.

Instead, try “FENCE”:
- F and C are new.  
- E is in position 4 (allowed).  
- N is in position 3 (allowed).  
- C and F are fresh letters.

This seems safe and informative.

Guess 3: FENCE -> FEEDBACK: F(x) E(-) N(-) C(x) E(-)

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters we have tried so far: A, R, O, S, U, T, F, C  
Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T, F, C  
Letters that ARE in the word (once each): N, I, E  

Position restrictions:
- E is not in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from UNTIE, FENCE)  
- N is not in positions 2 or 3 (from UNTIE, FENCE)  
- I is not in position 4 (from UNTIE)

So the word must contain N, I, E exactly once each, and two other letters chosen from the still-allowed consonants: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to place N, I, E in the remaining legal slots and fill the other two slots with fresh consonants.

Let’s list the legal positions for each required letter:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
E: allowed in 1, 3, 5 (cannot be 2,4,5) – actually 1 and 3 only  
N: allowed in 1, 4, 5 (cannot be 2,3)  
I: allowed in 1, 2, 3, 5 (cannot be 4)

We need a valid permutation of N, I, E plus two new consonants that satisfies these constraints.

One systematic way is to pick a candidate that places E in position 1 or 3, N in 4 or 5, and I in 1,2,3,5, while introducing new consonants.

Try placing E in 1, N in 4, I in 2:

E I _ N _

We need two more consonants. Let’s pick B and D:

E I B N D  – but this isn’t a valid English word.

Swap to E I D N B – still not a word.

Try E in 3, N in 5, I in 1:

I _ E _ N

Fill the blanks with B and D: I B E D N – not a word.

Try I in 2, E in 1, N in 5:

E I _ _ N

Fill with B and D: E I B D N – not a word.

Try E in 3, N in 4, I in 5:

_ _ E N I

Fill with B and D: B D E N I – not a word.

Try E in 1, N in 5, I in 3:

E _ I _ N

Fill with B and D: E B I D N – not a word.

Try E in 1, N in 4, I in 5:

E _ _ N I

Fill with B and D: E B B N I – not a word.

Let’s try introducing new consonants that form a valid word.

Consider the word “WIELD”:
- W, L, D are new letters.  
- E is in position 3 (allowed).  
- I is in position 2 (allowed).  
- L is new.  
- D is new.  
- Contains N? No, but we need N. So discard.

Consider “YIELD”:
- Y, L, D new.  
- E in 3, I in 2, but no N. Discard.

Consider “BINED”:
- B, D new.  
- I in 2, N in 3, E in 4 – but E is not allowed in 4. Discard.

Consider “PINED”:
- P, D new.  
- I in 2, N in 3, E in 4 – E not allowed in 4. Discard.

Consider “GIVEN”:
- G, V new.  
- I in 2, V in 4, E in 3 (allowed), N in 5 (allowed).  
- Check positions:  
  – E is in 3 (allowed)  
  – N is in 5 (allowed)  
  – I is in 2 (allowed)  
  – G and V are new letters.  
- “GIVEN” is a valid English word.

This satisfies all constraints.

From the four rounds we have:

Letters known NOT to be in the word (x feedback):
A, R, O, S, U, T, F, C, V

Letters known TO be in the word (– feedback, but wrong position):
E, N, I, G

So the secret word must contain the letters E, N, I, G exactly once each, and one additional letter that has not yet been ruled out.  
Remaining consonants that are still allowed: B, D, H, K, L, M, P, W, Y, etc.

We now know the exact set of five letters: {E, N, I, G, X}, where X is one of the still-allowed consonants.

Next, we must place these five letters into positions 1-5 while respecting the positional restrictions gathered so far:

Position restrictions:
- E is NOT in positions 2, 4, 5 (from UNTIE, FENCE, GIVEN)
  ⇒ E must be in position 1 or 3.
- N is NOT in positions 2, 3, 5 (from UNTIE, FENCE, GIVEN)
  ⇒ N must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- I is NOT in position 4 (from UNTIE)
  ⇒ I can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- G is NOT in position 1 (from GIVEN)
  ⇒ G can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

We need a valid permutation of E, N, I, G, X that meets these constraints. Let’s list the possible positions for each letter:

Possible positions:
E: 1, 3
N: 1, 4, 5
I: 1, 2, 3, 5
G: 2, 3, 4, 5

Let’s look for a placement that satisfies all constraints. One systematic way is to try placing E in position 1 first.

Case 1: E in position 1
Then the remaining letters to place are N, I, G, X in positions 2-5.

Constraints for the remaining positions:
- N must be in 4 or 5 (since 1 is taken by E)
- I must be in 2, 3, or 5
- G must be in 2, 3, or 4 (since 5 is allowed but let’s see)

Let’s try N in position 4:
Then we have:
1: E
2: ?
3: ?
4: N
5: ?

Letters left to place: I, G, X in positions 2, 3, 5.

I must be in 2 or 3 (since 5 is allowed but let’s try 2 first).
G must be in 2, 3, or 4 (but 4 is N), so 2 or 3.
X is the remaining consonant.

Possible arrangement:
1: E
2: I
3: G
4: N
5: X

This gives the word E I G N X. We need to check if this forms a valid English word. The letters are E, I, G, N, X. The only valid English word with these letters is ""EIGNS"" (but that’s not a word) or ""ENGIX"" (not valid). So this arrangement doesn’t work.

Let’s try I in position 2 and G in position 3:
1: E
2: I
3: G
4: N
5: X

Same as above, no valid word.

Let’s try N in position 5 instead:
Then we have:
1: E
2: ?
3: ?
4: ?
5: N

Letters left: I, G, X in positions 2, 3, 4.

I must be in 2, 3, or 4.
G must be in 2, 3, or 4.

Let’s try I in 2 and G in 3:
1: E
2: I
3: G
4: X
5: N

This gives E I G X N. The letters are E, I, G, X, N. The only valid English word with these letters is ""EIGXN"" – not valid.

Let’s try I in 2 and G in 4:
1: E
2: I
3: X
4: G
5: N

This gives E I X G N – not a word.

Let’s try I in 3 and G in 2:
1: E
2: G

This gives E G I X N – not a word.

Case 2: E in position 3
Then the remaining letters to place are N, I, G, X in positions 1, 2, 4, 5.

Constraints:
- N must be in 1, 4, or 5
- I must be in 1, 2, or 5
- G must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is E), so 2, 4, or 5

Let’s try N in position 1:
1: N

G must be in 2, 4, or 5.

Let’s try I in 2 and G in 4:

We’ve exhausted the placements with E in position 1 and 3, and none have formed valid English words. This suggests we need to introduce a new consonant that forms a valid word.

Looking back, the only remaining consonants that have not been tried are B, D, H, K, L, M, P, W, Y.

Let’s try introducing the consonant D.

We need a permutation of E, N, I, G, D that satisfies the positional restrictions.
