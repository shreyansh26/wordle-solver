### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This will help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word. 

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but ""AROSE"" gives slightly better coverage of vowels. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains O, but O cannot be in position 3.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses O (but not in position 3).
2. Avoids A, R, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good vowels: I, U (since A, E are out and O is already known to be present).

Let me pick a word that uses O in a different position and introduces new common letters. ""POINT"" is a good candidate:
- P, O, I, N, T are all new letters.
- O is in position 2, satisfying the (-) feedback (not position 3).

Another candidate is ""DOING"" but ""POINT"" is slightly more common and covers more consonants. I'll go with POINT.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)

   – O is in the word but not in position 2.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, etc.

We need to place O and I in the two remaining blanks (positions 2 and 3), but respecting the positional constraints:
- O cannot be in 2 or 3 → impossible, so O must be in 4.  
- I cannot be in 3 → so I must be in 2.

Thus the pattern is: P I _ O T.

We need a consonant for position 3 that has not been ruled out (not A, R, S, E, N).
