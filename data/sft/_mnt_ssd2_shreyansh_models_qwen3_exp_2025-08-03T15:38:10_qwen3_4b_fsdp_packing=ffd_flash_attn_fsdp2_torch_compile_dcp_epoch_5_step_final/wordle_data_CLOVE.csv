For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters to maximize information gain.

A good starting word often has distinct letters to test as many possibilities as possible. ""AROSE"" is a popular starting word because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 5th, so it must be 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 3rd; but 3rd is already O, so 1st, 2nd, or 4th).
- A, R, S are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Must contain E somewhere except 5th position.
- Cannot contain A, R, S.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in 3rd position.
2. Has E in 1st, 2nd, or 4th position.
3. Does not contain A, R, S.

Let me think of words fitting this pattern. Possible candidates:
- ELOPE (E 1st, O 3rd, E 4th) - but has E in 4th, which is allowed.
- OCEAN - but has A (invalid).
- ELOPE seems valid, but let me check if it's a valid word - yes, it means to steal someone's lover.

Another candidate: ELBOW - but has W (not sure if helpful).
Another: EMBER - but has R (invalid).
Another: EJECT - has J and C, but J is less common.
Another: ELOPE seems best.

Wait, let me think if there's a better word with more common letters. Maybe:
- ELOPE (E, L, O, P, E) - but has two Es, which might not help much.
- ELOPE is valid, but let me think if there's another.

Actually, ""OCEAN"" is invalid due to A. ""OFTEN"" has F and N, but F is less common. ""ELBOW"" has B and W. 

Perhaps ""ELOPE"" is the best first guess here, as it tests E in 1st position and O in 3rd, and introduces L, P which are common letters.

But wait, the feedback said E is in the word but wrong position (it was 5th, so must be 1st, 2nd, or 4th). So E could be 1st, 2nd, or 4th. 

Let me think of a word with O in 3rd and E in 2nd: _ E O _ _. Words like ""BELOW"" - but has B and L, but W is less common. ""DEMON"" - has D, M, N. Not great.

A better word might be ""ELOPE"" with E in 1st, O in 3rd, and P in 4th. This tests E in 1st position, O in 3rd, and introduces L and P.

Alternatively, ""OCEAN"" is invalid. ""OFTEN"" is valid but has F which is less common. 

I think ""ELOPE"" is the best next guess here.
