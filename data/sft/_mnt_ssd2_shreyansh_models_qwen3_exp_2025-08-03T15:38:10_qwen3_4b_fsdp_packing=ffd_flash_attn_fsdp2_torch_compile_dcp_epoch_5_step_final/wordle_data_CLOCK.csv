For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""ADIEU,"" or ""RAISE."" These words cover frequently used letters in English.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should include several of these. 

""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It contains 3 very common vowels (A, I, E)
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This will give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their positions.

All five letters in RAISE (R, A, I, S, E) are marked “x,” so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we can safely ignore R, A, I, S, E entirely.

A good next guess should:
1. Avoid those five letters.
2. Use other high-frequency letters that weren’t ruled out.  
The next-most-common letters not yet tried are: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, P, M, G, H.

A balanced word covering several of these is “TULIP” (T, U, L, I, P).  
However, I is already ruled out, so let’s pick a word with none of R, A, I, S, E.

“TULOG” uses T, U, L, O, G — all still possible.  
Another option is “CLOUD” (C, L, O, U, D).  
Between those, “CLOUD” has slightly higher letter frequency overall.

So I’ll guess CLOUD.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""ADIEU,"" or ""RAISE."" These words cover frequently used letters in English.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should include several of these. 

""RAISE"" is an excellent choice because:
- It contains 3 very common vowels (A, I, E)
- It has 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
- It's a valid 5-letter word

This will give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in RAISE (R, A, I, S, E) are marked “x,” so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we can safely ignore R, A, I, S, E entirely.

A good next guess should:
1. Avoid those five letters.
2. Use other high-frequency letters that weren’t ruled out.  
The next-most-common letters not yet tried are: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, P, M, G, H.

A balanced word covering several of these is “TULIP” (T, U, L, I, P).  
However, I is already ruled out, so let’s pick a word with none of R, A, I, S, E.

“TULOG” uses T, U, L, O, G — all still possible.  
Another option is “CLOUD” (C, L, O, U, D).  
Between those, “CLOUD” has slightly higher letter frequency overall.

So I’ll guess CLOUD.

Guess 2: CLOUD -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)  
   Eliminates: R, A, I, S, E

2. CLOUD → C(✓) L(✓) O(✓) U(x) D(x)  
   Confirms: C is 1st letter, L is 2nd letter, O is 3rd letter  
   Eliminates: U, D

So far we know the word looks like: C L O _ _

Letters still possible: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
(We can ignore all already ruled out: R, A, I, S, E, U, D)

We need two more letters to fill the 4th and 5th positions, using only the still-possible letters.

Let’s look for common 5-letter words that start with “CLO” and use only the still-allowed letters.  
Possible endings:  
- CLOWN (but W and N are allowed)  
- CLOMP (M, P allowed)  
- CLOAK (A is eliminated)  
- CLOPS (S is eliminated)  
- CLOOT (O is already used in position 3, but double O is possible, but T is allowed)  
- CLOMP seems valid: C L O M P

Checking letters: C, L, O, M, P — none are in the eliminated list.  
So “CLOMP” is a good candidate.

Another candidate: “CLOWN” — C L O W N.  
All letters are still possible.

Between CLOMP and CLOWN, both fit the constraints.  
CLOMP uses M and P, which are fairly common.  
CLOWN uses W and N, also common.  
I’ll choose CLOMP first.

- CLOWN (but W and N are allowed)  
- CLOMP (M, P allowed)  
- CLOAK (A is eliminated)  
- CLOPS (S is eliminated)  
- CLOOT (O is already used in position 3, but double O is possible, but T is allowed)  
- CLOMP seems valid: C L O M P

Checking letters: C, L, O, M, P — none are in the eliminated list.  
So “CLOMP” is a good candidate.

Another candidate: “CLOWN” — C L O W N.  
All letters are still possible.

Between CLOMP and CLOWN, both fit the constraints.  
CLOMP uses M and P, which are fairly common.  
CLOWN uses W and N, also common.  
I’ll choose CLOMP first.

We now know:

- The word starts with C L O _ _  
- The letters U, D, M, P are eliminated  
- All other letters not yet ruled out (R, A, I, S, E, U, D, M, P) are still possible

Looking at the pattern C L O _ _, common English words include:

- CLOWN (C L O W N)  
- CLOOT (C L O O T)  
- CLOAK (but A is eliminated)  
- CLOPS (but P and S are eliminated)

Between CLOWN and CLOOT:

- CLOWN uses W and N, neither of which has been eliminated.  
- CLOOT uses T twice; T has not been eliminated, but we’d rather avoid repeating letters unless necessary.

CLOWN is therefore the safer, more common word that fits all constraints.

We now know:

- The word starts with C L O _ _  
- Eliminated letters: R, A, I, S, E, U, D, M, P, W, N

That leaves these letters still possible: B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, T, V, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters to fill the 4th and 5th positions, using only the still-allowed letters.

Looking for common 5-letter words that start with “CLO” and use only the remaining letters:

- CLOOT (but O is already in position 3; double O is allowed, but T is still possible)  
- CLOUT (but U and T are allowed, but U was eliminated)  
- CLOVE (E is eliminated)  
- CLOWN (N and W eliminated)  

The only remaining plausible word seems to be CLOOT, as it uses only letters not yet eliminated (C, L, O, O, T).

All other combinations either repeat O (CLOOT) or use letters that have been ruled out.

Therefore, the next logical guess is CLOOT.

From the feedback so far:

1. C(✓) L(✓) O(✓) O(-) T(x)  
   - The first three letters are locked: C L O _ _
   - The fourth letter is O (because the second O received “-”, meaning it is in the word but not in position 4).  
   - The fifth letter T is eliminated.

So the word must be C L O O _ and the last letter must be one of the still-allowed letters:  
B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit C L O O _:

- CLOOF (not a common word)  
- CLOOG (not valid)  
- CLOOK (not valid)  
- CLOOP (not valid)  
- CLOOS (not valid)  
- CLOOT (already tried, T eliminated)  
- CLOVE (E eliminated)  
- CLOWN (N and W eliminated)

The only remaining plausible word is CLOOF, but it’s uncommon.  
However, checking the remaining letters, CLOOK, CLOOG, etc., aren’t valid.  
Realizing that CLOOS isn’t a word, and CLOOF is obscure, I must have missed a common word.

Rechecking: the only valid common word starting with CLOO is CLOOF, but it’s rare.  
However, the letter Z is still allowed, and CLOOZ isn’t a word.  
Wait—let me list all valid 5-letter words starting with CLOO:

- CLOOF (valid, though rare)  
- CLOOS (invalid)  
- CLOOT (already tried)  

CLOOF is the only valid word left.  
But since we have only one guess left before reaching 6, and Wordle typically uses common words, I must have made an error in tracking allowed letters.

Re-evaluating eliminated letters:  
Eliminated so far: R, A, I, S, E, U, D, M, P, W, N, T  
Allowed letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, X, Y, Z, O (O already used in positions 3 and 4)

The only valid word fitting C L O O _ is CLOOF.  
Therefore, the next guess must be CLOOF.
