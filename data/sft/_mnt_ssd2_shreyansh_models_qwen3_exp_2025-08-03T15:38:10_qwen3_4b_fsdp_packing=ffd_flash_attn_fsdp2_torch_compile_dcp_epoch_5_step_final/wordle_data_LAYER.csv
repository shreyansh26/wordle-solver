### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

After considering options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English words

This will give me good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the new feedback on EARLY:

- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 1.
- A(✓): A is in the word AND in position 2 (locked in).
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 3.
- L(-): L is in the word but not in position 4.
- Y(-): Y is in the word but not in position 5.

Summary of what we now know:

Letters that ARE in the word:
- A (position 2 is fixed)
- R (cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 → must be 4 or 5)
- E (cannot be in positions 1, 2, 5 → must be 3 or 4)
- L (cannot be in position 4 → must be 1, 2, 3, 5; but 2 is A, so 1, 3, 5)
- Y (cannot be in position 5 → must be 1, 2, 3, 4; but 2 is A, so 1, 3, 4)

Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S, C, T.

We have a 5-letter word with:
- Position 2 = A
- Must contain R, E, L, Y exactly once each, plus one more letter (but we already have 4 letters A, R, E, L, Y – wait, that’s 5 letters; so the word must be A R E L Y in some permutation that satisfies the constraints).

Wait, that can’t be. The word must be 5 letters, and we already have A, R, E, L, Y – that’s exactly 5 distinct letters. So the word must be a permutation of A, R, E, L, Y with:
- A in position 2 (fixed)
- R not in 1, 2, 3 → must be 4 or 5
- E not in 1, 2, 5 → must be 3 or 4
- L not in 4 → must be 1, 3, 5
- Y not in 5 → must be 1, 3, 4

Let’s list possible permutations:

We need:
- Position 2 = A
- R must be 4 or 5
- E must be 3 or 4
- L must be 1, 3, 5
- Y must be 1, 3, 4

Case 1: R in 4
Then E must be 3 (since 4 is taken by R)
So positions:
1: ?
2: A
3: E
4: R
5: ?

Letters left to place: L and Y
Constraints:
- L cannot be 4 (already 4 is R) and cannot be 5 if we put Y in 1 or 3, but 3 is E.
Wait, positions 1 and 5 must be L and Y in some order, but:
- Y cannot be 5 (from feedback), so Y must be 1 and L must be 5.
So word would be: Y A E R L

Check constraints:
- A is in 2: ✓
- R is in 4: allowed (not in 1,2,3)
- E is in 3: allowed (not in 1,2,5)
- L is in 5: allowed (not in 4)
- Y is in 1: allowed (not in 5)

This seems valid.

Case 2: R in 5
Then E must be 3 or 4
Subcase 2a: E in 3
Positions:
1: ?
2: A
3: E
4: ?
5: R

Letters left: L and Y for positions 1 and 4
Constraints:
- L not in 4 → L cannot be 4, so L must be 1 and Y must be 4.
Word: L A E Y R

Check:
- A in 2: ✓
- R in 5: allowed (not in 1,2,3)
- E in 3: allowed (not in 1,2,5)
- L in 1: allowed (not in 4)
- Y in 4: allowed (not in 5)

Subcase 2b: E in 4
Positions:
1: ?
2: A
3: ?
4: E
5: R

Letters left: L and Y for 1 and 3
Constraints:
- L not in 4 (already 4 is E) and cannot be 5 (already 5 is R)
So L can be 1 or 3
Y cannot be 5 (already 5 is R) and cannot be in 4 (already 4 is E)
So Y can be 1 or 3

Possible combinations:
- L in 1, Y in 3 → Y A L E R
- Y in 1, L in 3 → Y A L E R (same as above)
Wait, no:
- If L is 1 and Y is 3: L A Y E R
- If Y is 1 and L is 3: Y A L E R

Both need checking:
L A Y E R:
- A in 2: ✓
- R in 5: allowed
- E in 4: allowed (not in 1,2,5)
- L in 1: allowed (not in 4)
- Y in 3: allowed (not in 5)

Y A L E R:
- A in 2: ✓
- R in 5: allowed
- E in 4: allowed
- Y in 1: allowed (not in 5)
- L in 3: allowed (not in 4)

Both are valid, but let’s pick one.

Between the three possible words:
1. Y A E R L
2. L A E Y R
3. L A Y E R
4. Y A L E R

We need to choose one. Let’s pick Y A E R L (Y A E R L) – but wait, Y A E R L is Y A E R L, which is valid.

However, let’s check if any of these are actual English words:
- Y A E R L – not a valid word
- L A E Y R – not valid
- L A Y E R – valid (as in ""layer"")
- Y A L E R – not valid

So the only valid word among these is L A Y E R.

Therefore, the next guess should be LAYER.

Based on the feedback, we now know:
- A is locked in position 2.
- R must be in position 4 or 5.
- E must be in position 3 or 4.
- L and Y must occupy the remaining slots while respecting their constraints.

The only valid English word that satisfies all these constraints is:
