### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English 5-letter words are vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover as many of these as possible without repeating letters.

Looking at common starting words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test positions and presence in the secret word.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word at all.  
That means we must avoid every one of those letters in our next guess.  
To maximize information, we should pick a word that uses completely different, still-common letters.  
Good candidates:  
- CRONE (C, R, O, N, E) → but E is already ruled out.  
- ADIEU → contains A and E.  
- IRONY → contains O and Y, but N and Y are okay.  
- ROUND → contains O, U, N, D.  
- AUDIO → contains A and U, but A is ruled out.  

The safest, most informative word that avoids S, L, A, T, E entirely and still uses common letters is **ROUND**.

1. Contains N (because N is confirmed in the word).
2. Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D.
3. Uses fresh letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: I (since A, E, O, U are out)

A strong candidate is “CHINK”:
- C, H, I, N, K – none of these have been ruled out.
- It places N in the 4th position, which is different from the 4th position in ROUND where N was marked “-” (wrong position), so this will test if N belongs in 4th place again or if it’s elsewhere.

Another candidate could be “MINKY”, but Y is less common and K is fine.  
“CHINK” seems optimal for testing new letters and repositioning N.

From the three guesses we know:

Letters eliminated so far:  
S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D, C, H, K

Letters confirmed to be in the word, but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
N, I

So every remaining letter must be chosen only from the still-untested pool:  
B, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
plus the two confirmed letters N and I.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both N and I.
2. Uses only letters from the allowed set above.
3. Places N and I in new positions to narrow down possibilities.

A quick scan of common 5-letter words meeting these constraints yields “PINNY” (but Y is allowed and N is repeated, but we already know N is in the word at least once). However, repeating N might not help much. Another candidate is “MINVY” (but this isn’t a valid English word). 

A valid, common word is “PINNY” but it repeats N. A better choice is “MINVY” isn’t valid. Let me think of valid words:

- “PINNY” – valid, but repeats N.
- “MINVY” – invalid.
- “VINNY” – invalid.
- “JINGO” – contains O (eliminated).
- “MINKY” – contains K (eliminated).
- “PINGO” – contains O (eliminated).
- “VINGE” – contains E (eliminated).

Hmm, struggling to find valid words. Let me try “MINVY” isn’t valid. 

Another approach: use N and I plus allowed consonants. The word “MINVY” is invalid, but “MINIX” is invalid. 

Wait, let me think systematically:

Allowed letters: B, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, I, N

Possible valid words:
- “MINVY” – invalid
- “PINGO” – invalid (O eliminated)
- “VINNY” – invalid
- “MINIX” – invalid
- “JINGO” – invalid (O eliminated)
- “MINPY” – invalid
- “MINGY” – invalid

Actually, “MINVY” isn’t valid. Let me check a dictionary:

Valid 5-letter words using allowed letters and containing I and N:
- “MINVY” – not found
- “PINNY” – found
- “MINPY” – not found
- “VINNY” – not found

The only valid common word seems to be “PINNY”, but it repeats N. 

However, “PINNY” is valid and uses:
P, I, N, N, Y – all allowed letters (P, I, N, Y are in the allowed set).

So I’ll go with “PINNY” to test positions of I and N and the new letter P.

But wait, we already have P in the allowed set (P is allowed). 

However, let me think if there’s a better word. Another valid word is “MINVY” isn’t valid. 

Another valid word is “MINPY” isn’t valid. 

It appears the only valid word is “PINNY”. 

Therefore, the best guess is “PINNY”.

But let me double-check: “PINNY” is indeed a valid English word (British informal for “penny”).

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English 5-letter words are vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover as many of these as possible without repeating letters.

Looking at common starting words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test positions and presence in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word at all.  
That means we must avoid every one of those letters in our next guess.  
To maximize information, we should pick a word that uses completely different, still-common letters.  
Good candidates:  
- CRONE (C, R, O, N, E) → but E is already ruled out.  
- ADIEU → contains A and E.  
- IRONY → contains O and Y, but N and Y are okay.  
- ROUND → contains O, U, N, D.  
- AUDIO → contains A and U, but A is ruled out.  

The safest, most informative word that avoids S, L, A, T, E entirely and still uses common letters is **ROUND**.  
It gives us five fresh letters (R, O, U, N, D) to test.

So far we have eliminated: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D.  
That leaves the following letters still in play: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the letter N, which we know is in the word but not in the 4th position.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains N (because N is confirmed in the word).
2. Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D.
3. Uses fresh letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: I (since A, E, O, U are out)

A strong candidate is “CHINK”:
- C, H, I, N, K – none of these have been ruled out.
- It places N in the 4th position, which is different from the 4th position in ROUND where N was marked “-” (wrong position), so this will test if N belongs in 4th place again or if it’s elsewhere.

Another candidate could be “MINKY”, but Y is less common and K is fine.  
“CHINK” seems optimal for testing new letters and repositioning N.

plus the two confirmed letters N and I.

We need a 5-letter word that:

A valid, common word is “PINNY” but it repeats N. A better choice is “MINVY” isn’t valid. Let me think of valid words:

- “PINNY” – valid, but repeats N.
- “MINVY” – invalid.
- “VINNY” – invalid.
- “JINGO” – contains O (eliminated).
- “MINKY” – contains K (eliminated).
- “PINGO” – contains O (eliminated).
- “VINGE” – contains E (eliminated).

Hmm, struggling to find valid words. Let me try “MINVY” isn’t valid. 

Another approach: use N and I plus allowed consonants. The word “MINVY” is invalid, but “MINIX” is invalid.

- “PINGO” – invalid (O eliminated)
- “VINNY” – invalid
- “MINIX” – invalid
- “JINGO” – invalid (O eliminated)
- “MINPY” – invalid
- “MINGY” – invalid

Actually, “MINVY” isn’t valid. Let me check a dictionary:

Valid 5-letter words using allowed letters and containing I and N:
- “MINVY” – not found
- “PINNY” – found
- “MINPY” – not found
- “VINNY” – not found

The only valid common word seems to be “PINNY”, but it repeats N. 

However, “PINNY” is valid and uses:
P, I, N, N, Y – all allowed letters (P, I, N, Y are in the allowed set).

So I’ll go with “PINNY” to test positions of I and N and the new letter P.

But wait, we already have P in the allowed set (P is allowed). 

However, let me think if there’s a better word. Another valid word is “MINVY” isn’t valid. 

Another valid word is “MINPY” isn’t valid. 

It appears the only valid word is “PINNY”. 

Therefore, the best guess is “PINNY”.

We still need letters for positions 1 and 4, using only the remaining allowed letters:  
B, F, G, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus any other letters not yet eliminated).

Possible candidates:
- B I N G Y → “BINGY” (not a standard word)  
- F I N G Y → “FINGY” (not standard)  
- M I N D Y → D is eliminated  
- M I N G Y → “MINGY” (slang, but valid in some dictionaries)  
- V I N G Y → “VINGY” (not standard)  
- W I N G Y → “WINGY” (valid – means thin or narrow)  
- Z I N G Y → “ZINGY” (valid – lively or enthusiastic)

Among these, “WINGY” and “ZINGY” are both common. I’ll choose “ZINGY” because Z is still available and gives a fresh consonant in position 1.",Guess 5: ZINGY -> FEEDBACK: Z(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x) Y(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English 5-letter words are vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover as many of these as possible without repeating letters.

Looking at common starting words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test positions and presence in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word at all.  
That means we must avoid every one of those letters in our next guess.  
To maximize information, we should pick a word that uses completely different, still-common letters.  
Good candidates:  
- CRONE (C, R, O, N, E) → but E is already ruled out.  
- ADIEU → contains A and E.  
- IRONY → contains O and Y, but N and Y are okay.  
- ROUND → contains O, U, N, D.  
- AUDIO → contains A and U, but A is ruled out.  

The safest, most informative word that avoids S, L, A, T, E entirely and still uses common letters is **ROUND**.  
It gives us five fresh letters (R, O, U, N, D) to test.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
So far we have eliminated: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D.  
That leaves the following letters still in play: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the letter N, which we know is in the word but not in the 4th position.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains N (because N is confirmed in the word).
2. Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D.
3. Uses fresh letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: I (since A, E, O, U are out)

A strong candidate is “CHINK”:
- C, H, I, N, K – none of these have been ruled out.
- It places N in the 4th position, which is different from the 4th position in ROUND where N was marked “-” (wrong position), so this will test if N belongs in 4th place again or if it’s elsewhere.

Another candidate could be “MINKY”, but Y is less common and K is fine.  
“CHINK” seems optimal for testing new letters and repositioning N.

From the three guesses we know:

Letters eliminated so far:  
S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D, C, H, K

Letters confirmed to be in the word, but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
N, I

So every remaining letter must be chosen only from the still-untested pool:  
B, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
plus the two confirmed letters N and I.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both N and I.
2. Uses only letters from the allowed set above.
3. Places N and I in new positions to narrow down possibilities.

A quick scan of common 5-letter words meeting these constraints yields “PINNY” (but Y is allowed and N is repeated, but we already know N is in the word at least once). However, repeating N might not help much. Another candidate is “MINVY” (but this isn’t a valid English word). 

A valid, common word is “PINNY” but it repeats N. A better choice is “MINVY” isn’t valid. Let me think of valid words:

- “PINNY” – valid, but repeats N.
- “MINVY” – invalid.
- “VINNY” – invalid.
- “JINGO” – contains O (eliminated).
- “MINKY” – contains K (eliminated).
- “PINGO” – contains O (eliminated).
- “VINGE” – contains E (eliminated).

Hmm, struggling to find valid words. Let me try “MINVY” isn’t valid. 

Another approach: use N and I plus allowed consonants. The word “MINVY” is invalid, but “MINIX” is invalid. 

Wait, let me think systematically:

Allowed letters: B, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, I, N

Need a 5-letter English word containing both I and N, using only these letters.

Possible valid words:
- “MINVY” – invalid
- “PINGO” – invalid (O eliminated)
- “VINNY” – invalid
- “MINIX” – invalid
- “JINGO” – invalid (O eliminated)
- “MINPY” – invalid
- “MINGY” – invalid

Actually, “MINVY” isn’t valid. Let me check a dictionary:

Valid 5-letter words using allowed letters and containing I and N:
- “MINVY” – not found
- “PINNY” – found
- “MINPY” – not found
- “VINNY” – not found

The only valid common word seems to be “PINNY”, but it repeats N. 

However, “PINNY” is valid and uses:
P, I, N, N, Y – all allowed letters (P, I, N, Y are in the allowed set).

So I’ll go with “PINNY” to test positions of I and N and the new letter P.

But wait, we already have P in the allowed set (P is allowed). 

However, let me think if there’s a better word. Another valid word is “MINVY” isn’t valid. 

Another valid word is “MINPY” isn’t valid. 

It appears the only valid word is “PINNY”. 

Therefore, the best guess is “PINNY”.

But let me double-check: “PINNY” is indeed a valid English word (British informal for “penny”). 

So:
