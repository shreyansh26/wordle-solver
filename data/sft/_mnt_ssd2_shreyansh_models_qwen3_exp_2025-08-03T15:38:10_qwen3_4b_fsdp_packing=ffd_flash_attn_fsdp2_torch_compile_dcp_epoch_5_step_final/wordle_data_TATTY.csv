For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This will help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word, giving me good information for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it cannot be first).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

That tells me:
1. The word contains an A somewhere other than the first letter.
2. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.
3. I still need to test other vowels (I, U) and common consonants (T, L, N, D, etc.).

A good second guess should:
- Keep the A but move it to a different position.
- Introduce new, common letters that haven’t been ruled out.
- Avoid any of the eliminated letters (R, O, S, E).

A strong candidate is “TAINT”:
- It keeps A (second letter) and moves it away from position 1.
- It introduces T, I, N, and another A (but A is already known to be present).
- It avoids all eliminated letters.

However, “TAINT” has two As, which might not be optimal since we only know one A exists. A better choice is “TAILS” but S is eliminated. Next is “TAINT” or “LAINT” but T is common. 

Another strong choice is “PLAIN”:
- P is a common consonant not yet tested.
- L, I, N are also common and untested.
- A is moved to position 2.

But “PLAIN” has A in position 2, which is safe since A can’t be in position 1. This seems optimal.

Wait, let me double-check: “PLAIN” uses P, L, A, I, N. None of R, O, S, E appear. This looks good.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This will help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word, giving me good information for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it cannot be first).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

That tells me:
1. The word contains an A somewhere other than the first letter.
2. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.
3. I still need to test other vowels (I, U) and common consonants (T, L, N, D, etc.).

A good second guess should:
- Keep the A but move it to a different position.
- Introduce new, common letters that haven’t been ruled out.
- Avoid any of the eliminated letters (R, O, S, E).

A strong candidate is “TAINT”:
- It keeps A (second letter) and moves it away from position 1.
- It introduces T, I, N, and another A (but A is already known to be present).
- It avoids all eliminated letters.

However, “TAINT” has two As, which might not be optimal since we only know one A exists. A better choice is “TAILS” but S is eliminated. Next is “TAINT” or “LAINT” but T is common. 

Another strong choice is “PLAIN”:
- P is a common consonant not yet tested.
- L, I, N are also common and untested.
- A is moved to position 2.

But “PLAIN” has A in position 2, which is safe since A can’t be in position 1. This seems optimal.

Wait, let me double-check: “PLAIN” uses P, L, A, I, N. None of R, O, S, E appear. This looks good.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
R, O, S, E, P, L, I, N

Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown):  
A (and it is NOT in position 3)

So the remaining alphabet letters to test are:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We still need to test the vowels U (since A is already confirmed and we only have one vowel confirmed) and the common consonants T, D, M, K, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Place the known letter A in a new position (positions 2, 4, or 5 are still open).
2. Introduce several new, high-frequency letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Candidate words:
- “MADAM” – but M and D are untested, and A is in positions 2 and 4. However, this repeats A, which might waste a slot.
- “TACKY” – uses T, C, K, Y, and places A in position 2. All letters are untested except A.
- “DAUNT” – uses D, U, N, T. But N is already ruled out.
- “GAUDY” – uses G, U, D, Y. A is in position 2. All letters are untested.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This will help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word, giving me good information for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it cannot be first).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

That tells me:
1. The word contains an A somewhere other than the first letter.
2. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.
3. I still need to test other vowels (I, U) and common consonants (T, L, N, D, etc.).

A good second guess should:
- Keep the A but move it to a different position.
- Introduce new, common letters that haven’t been ruled out.
- Avoid any of the eliminated letters (R, O, S, E).

A strong candidate is “TAINT”:
- It keeps A (second letter) and moves it away from position 1.
- It introduces T, I, N, and another A (but A is already known to be present).
- It avoids all eliminated letters.

However, “TAINT” has two As, which might not be optimal since we only know one A exists. A better choice is “TAILS” but S is eliminated. Next is “TAINT” or “LAINT” but T is common. 

Another strong choice is “PLAIN”:
- P is a common consonant not yet tested.
- L, I, N are also common and untested.
- A is moved to position 2.

But “PLAIN” has A in position 2, which is safe since A can’t be in position 1. This seems optimal.

Wait, let me double-check: “PLAIN” uses P, L, A, I, N. None of R, O, S, E appear. This looks good.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
R, O, S, E, P, L, I, N

Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown):  
A (and it is NOT in position 3)

So the remaining alphabet letters to test are:  
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We still need to test the vowels U (since A is already confirmed and we only have one vowel confirmed) and the common consonants T, D, M, K, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Place the known letter A in a new position (positions 2, 4, or 5 are still open).
2. Introduce several new, high-frequency letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Candidate words:
- “MADAM” – but M and D are untested, and A is in positions 2 and 4. However, this repeats A, which might waste a slot.
- “TACKY” – uses T, C, K, Y, and places A in position 2. All letters are untested except A.
- “DAUNT” – uses D, U, N, T. But N is already ruled out.
- “GAUDY” – uses G, U, D, Y. A is in position 2. All letters are untested.

“GAUDY” seems optimal: it places A in position 2 (new position), introduces G, U, D, Y – all high-frequency letters not yet ruled out.

Guess 3: gaudy -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(✓) U(x) D(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
We now have two pieces of positional feedback:

- From plain: A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- From gaudy: A is in position 2 (✓) and Y is in position 5 (✓).

So the pattern so far is:
_ A _ _ Y

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
R, O, S, E, P, L, I, N, G, U, D

Remaining candidate letters (high-frequency first):
T, B, C, F, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need two more letters to fill positions 1 and 3. Good candidates:
- Position 1: T, B, C, F, H, K, M
- Position 3: T, B, C, F, H, J, K, M, V, W

A common consonant cluster is T in position 1 and K in position 3, forming ""TACKY"" – but K is allowed and C hasn't been ruled out. However, ""TACKY"" uses K and C, both untested.

Another option is ""BAFFY"" – but F is repeated, which might not help.

""CAVY_"" doesn't fit. ""FAVY_"" doesn't fit.

""MAJFY"" – no, doesn't fit.

""TABBY"" – B is repeated.

""TABBY"" has B in positions 2 and 4, but position 2 is already A.

Wait, we need:
_ A _ _ Y

So possible words:
- T A B B Y – but B is repeated.
- T A C K Y – C and K are untested, positions fit.
- T A M B Y – M and B are untested.
- B A C K Y – B and C and K are untested.
- C A P P Y – but P is ruled out.
- M A C K Y – M and C and K are untested.

Among these, ""TACKY"" seems most likely because T, C, K are all high-frequency and untested. Let's check:
- T: untested
- A: confirmed in position 2
- C: untested
- K: untested
- Y: confirmed in position 5

This fills positions 1, 3, 4 with new letters and matches the pattern _ A _ _ Y.
