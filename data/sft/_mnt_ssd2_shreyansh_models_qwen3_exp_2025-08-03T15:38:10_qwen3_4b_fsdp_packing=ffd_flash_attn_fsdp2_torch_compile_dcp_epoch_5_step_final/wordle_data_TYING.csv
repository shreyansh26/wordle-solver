### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, L  
- Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: N, T, I  

So the secret word contains the letters N, T, I, but none of A, R, O, S, E, U, L.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no A, R, O, S, E, U, L).
2. Contains N, T, I (since they’re confirmed in the word, just not in the positions tried so far).

Remaining common consonants: C, D, G, H, K, M, P, B, F, V, W, Y, Z, X, Q, J  
Remaining vowels: none except possibly Y acting as a vowel.

I’ll try to place N, T, I in new positions and fill the remaining two slots with safe, common letters. A good candidate is “INTY” plus one more consonant, but I need a valid 5-letter word.

“INTY” isn’t a word, but “INTOX” isn’t valid either. Instead, let’s try “TINTY” – but that repeats T and I, which might not help.

A better approach is to use a word like “TWINK” – but W and K are allowed, and it places N, T, I in new spots. However, “TWINK” has K at the end, which is fine.

But “TWINK” uses W, K – both allowed. Let’s check positions:
- T: previously in position 3 (feedback -), now in 1 – new position.
- W: new letter.
- I: previously in 4 (feedback -), now in 3 – new position.
- N: previously in 2 (feedback -), now in 4 – new position.
- K: new letter.

“TWINK” seems valid and uses allowed letters while repositioning N, T, I.

Another candidate is “TYING” – but Y is allowed, G is allowed, and it repositions:
- T: 1 (new)
- Y: new
- I: 2 (new)
- N: 4 (new)
- G: new

But “TYING” uses G, which is allowed, but I need to check if it’s a valid word – yes, it is.

Between “TWINK” and “TYING”, both seem good. “TWINK” uses K, which is slightly less common, so “TYING” might be safer.

Final choice: “TYING”
