### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use these letters without repeating any to test as many unique letters as possible.

One such word is ""AROSE"":
- Contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters
- No repeated letters

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use these letters without repeating any to test as many unique letters as possible.

One such word is ""AROSE"":
- Contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters
- No repeated letters
- This will help identify which of these common letters are in the word and their positions

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions): A, S
- A is somewhere in positions 2-5
- S is somewhere in positions 1-3 or 5

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S
2. Does NOT contain R, O, or E
3. Has A not in position 1 and S not in position 4

Good candidates would use remaining common letters like T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc. Let's try ""STAIN"":
- Contains S and A
- Does not contain R, O, or E
- A is in position 3 (allowed)
- S is in position 1 (allowed)
- Uses common letters T, I, N

Available letters (excluding R, O, E, I, N):

So far we have:

- First three letters locked: S T A _ _
- Letters already ruled out for positions 4 and 5: R, O, E, I, N, M, P, L, K  
- Remaining possible letters (from the alphabet excluding the ruled-out ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with “STA” and uses only the remaining letters in positions 4 and 5.

Let’s list possible endings:

- STAB_ → STABS (B and S, but S is already in position 1)
- STAC_ → STACO (invalid)
- STAD_ → STADE (E is ruled out)
- STAG_ → STAGS (G and S, S already used)
- STA_ _ → STAUX (rare)
- STA_ _ → STAVE (E ruled out)
- STA_ _ → STAWY (invalid)
- STA_ _ → STAXY (invalid)
- STA_ _ → STAID (I ruled out)
- STA_ _ → STAGY (invalid)
- STA_ _ → STASH (H and S, S already used)
- STA_ _ → STAYS (Y and S, S already used)

Looking at the remaining letters, the only valid word that fits is:

- STA + G + Y → STAGY (but Y is allowed, G is allowed) – however, STAGY is a valid word meaning “showing ostentation” or “affected,” and it uses G and Y, neither of which has been ruled out.

But let’s double-check: G and Y have not appeared in any prior guesses, and they are in the allowed set. STAGY is indeed a 5-letter English word.

However, another valid word is STAGS, but S is already used in position 1 and cannot appear again (since S is only present once in the word). Therefore STAGS is invalid.

The only remaining valid word is STAGY.

But let me check again: STAGY uses G and Y, both allowed, and no ruled-out letters. It is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next logical guess is STAGY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

- STAMP (but P is available)
- STAND (but N is already ruled out)
- STASH (H is available)
- STAYS (Y is available)
- STALK (K is available)
- STAMP (M, P are available)

Looking at the available letters, STASH and STAYS are both valid, but STASH uses H and S (S already used in position 1). STAYS uses Y and S (S already used). STALK uses K and L. STALL is 6 letters. STAMP is 5 letters and uses M, P.

STAMP seems like the most common word that fits all constraints:
- S T A M P
- All letters are unused or correctly placed
- Uses available letters M and P

We now know the first three letters are S T A and the last two letters must be chosen from the remaining unused letters that have not been ruled out.

Letters already ruled out: R, O, E, I, N, M, P  
Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form “STAXX” where the last two letters are from the allowed set. The most common endings for STA- that haven’t been tried yet are:

- STALK  (K is allowed, L is allowed)
- STASH  (H is allowed, but S is already used in position 1)
- STAYS  (Y is allowed, but S is already used)
- STALL  (invalid, 6 letters)
- STANG  (G is allowed, but N is ruled out)
- STAND  (N is ruled out)
- STASH  (already considered)
- STAYS  (already considered)

The only valid 5-letter word left that fits is STALK:
- S T A L K
- All letters are allowed by current constraints.

So far we have:

- First three letters locked: S T A _ _
- Letters already ruled out for positions 4 and 5: R, O, E, I, N, M, P, L, K  
- Remaining possible letters (from the alphabet excluding the ruled-out ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with “STA” and uses only the remaining letters in positions 4 and 5.

Let’s list possible endings:

- STAB_ → STABS (B and S, but S is already in position 1)
- STAC_ → STACO (invalid)
- STAD_ → STADE (E is ruled out)
- STAG_ → STAGS (G and S, S already used)
- STA_ _ → STAUX (rare)
- STA_ _ → STAVE (E ruled out)
- STA_ _ → STAWY (invalid)
- STA_ _ → STAXY (invalid)
- STA_ _ → STAID (I ruled out)
- STA_ _ → STAGY (invalid)
- STA_ _ → STASH (H and S, S already used)
- STA_ _ → STAYS (Y and S, S already used)

Looking at the remaining letters, the only valid word that fits is:

- STA + G + Y → STAGY (but Y is allowed, G is allowed) – however, STAGY is a valid word meaning “showing ostentation” or “affected,” and it uses G and Y, neither of which has been ruled out.

But let’s double-check: G and Y have not appeared in any prior guesses, and they are in the allowed set. STAGY is indeed a 5-letter English word.

However, another valid word is STAGS, but S is already used in position 1 and cannot appear again (since S is only present once in the word). Therefore STAGS is invalid.

The only remaining valid word is STAGY.

But let me check again: STAGY uses G and Y, both allowed, and no ruled-out letters. It is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next logical guess is STAGY.

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form “STAXX” where the last two letters are chosen from the remaining set.  
Scanning the dictionary for STA- words that use only these letters:

- STABS – B and S (S already in position 1, so invalid)  
- STABs – same issue  
- STACH – invalid  
- STACO – invalid

- STAUS – S already used  
- STAVE – E ruled out  
- STAWY – invalid  
- STAUX – X is allowed, but STAUX is rare or nonexistent  
- STAXX – invalid  

The only common English word left is **STAUS** (plural of status), but it repeats S in position 1 and 4, which is impossible because S is only present once in the word.  

Next possibility: **STA** + **D** + **H** → STADH – invalid.  
STA + D + Y → STADY – invalid (Y ruled out).  

Looking at the remaining letters, the only valid word that fits is:

- STA + B + S – invalid (S already used)

Letters: S T A F F
