### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A good strategy is to use a word with distinct common letters that can give me information about multiple positions at once. ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should help me quickly identify which of these common letters are in the word and their possible positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A good strategy is to use a word with distinct common letters that can give me information about multiple positions at once. ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should help me quickly identify which of these common letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E
- Letters that ARE in the word (but misplaced): A, S

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and S
- Does NOT contain R, O, or E
- A is not in position 1
- S is not in position 4

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already known to be present, and O, E are out)

Let’s try a word that places A and S in new positions and introduces new common letters.  
""SLANT"" is a good candidate:
- S in position 1 (new position for S)
- L, N, T are new common letters
- A in position 3 (new position for A)
- No R, O, E

- T(x) → T is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: S (fixed in position 1), A (somewhere else)
- Letters not in the word: R, O, E, L, N, T

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Contains A, but not in position 3.
3. Does not contain R, O, E, L, N, T.

Remaining common letters to try: D, I, C, U, M, P, Y, etc.

A good next guess would be ""SPACE"":
- Starts with S.
- Contains A (position 3 is now ruled out, but SPACE has A in position 2).
- Does not contain any forbidden letters (R, O, E, L, N, T).

From the latest feedback on SAPID:

- A(✓) – locked in position 2
- P(✓) – locked in position 3
- I(x) – I is not in the word
- D(x) – D is not in the word

So the word looks like: S A P _ _

Letters already confirmed: S, A, P in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.
Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, O, E, L, N, T, C, I, D.

Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need two more letters that are not forbidden and do not repeat S, A, P.

Common endings for SAP_ _:
- SAPHY (but H and Y are possible)
- SAPID (already tried)
- SAPER (but E and R are forbidden)
- SAPON (but O and N are forbidden)
- SAPPY (but Y is possible, and P is already used)

Looking at possible valid combinations:
- SAPHY: H and Y are allowed, but is ""SAPHY"" a valid English word? It seems like a name or not common.
- SAPPY: P is already used in position 3; we can't have P in position 4 or 5 because P is already confirmed in position 3 and we don't know if letters can repeat. The word ""SAPPY"" has P twice, which might be possible, but let's check if it's the most logical next guess.
- SAPER: E and R are forbidden, so this is invalid.
- SAVVY: V is allowed, but A is in position 2 (locked), so this doesn't fit.
- SAWNY: W and N are possible, but N is forbidden.
- SAKES: E and S are forbidden or already used.

Looking at valid 5-letter words starting with SAP:
- SAPPY: Valid word, but has double P which might be acceptable since P is confirmed in position 3.
- SAPID: Already tried.
- SAPER: Invalid (E, R forbidden).
- SAPHY: Not a common word.
- SAPPY seems the most plausible remaining option.

But let's think differently: since we have S A P _ _, and need two more letters not in the forbidden list. Possible endings:
- SAP + K + Y = SAPPY (but P is already in position 3)
- SAP + H + Y = SAPHY (not valid)
- SAP + M + Y = SAPMY (invalid)
- SAP + B + Y = SABBY (but B is allowed)
- SAP + K + E = SAKED (E forbidden)
- SAP + H + E = SAPHY (invalid)

Actually, the only valid word seems to be ""SAPPY"" even though it has double P, as P is confirmed in position 3 and we don't have info against double letters. Alternatively, ""SAP"" + ""HY"" = ""SAPHY"" is not valid.

Another approach: check dictionary for valid 5-letter words starting with SAP:
Valid words: SAPPY, SAPHY (not common), SAPPY is the main one.

Thus, the most logical next guess is SAPPY.

- SAP + H + Y = SAPHY (not valid)
- SAP + M + Y = SAPMY (invalid)
- SAP + B + Y = SABBY (but B is allowed)
- SAP + K + E = SAKED (E forbidden)
- SAP + H + E = SAPHY (invalid)

Actually, the only valid word seems to be ""SAPPY"" even though it has double P, as P is confirmed in position 3 and we don't have info against double letters. Alternatively, ""SAP"" + ""HY"" = ""SAPHY"" is not valid.

Another approach: check dictionary for valid 5-letter words starting with SAP:
Valid words: SAPPY, SAPHY (not common), SAPPY is the main one.

Thus, the most logical next guess is SAPPY.Based on the confirmed letters S, A, P in positions 1, 2, 3 and the eliminated letters, the only plausible remaining word is:",Guess 5: SAPPY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) P(✓) P(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
