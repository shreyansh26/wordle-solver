2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and common consonants. This should give us good feedback about which of these key letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another strong candidate is ""STARE"" (S, T, A, R, E), but ""AROSE"" has slightly better letter coverage. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a good mix of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x), R(x), O(x), S(x) → none of A, R, O, S are in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

- The word contains an E somewhere other than the last letter.

- U, N, T, I, E (none of A, R, O, S).
- E is in position 4, satisfying the feedback that E is in the word but not at position 5.

Summary of everything we know so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, F, L, C

Letters that ARE in the word:
- E is in the word and is in position 3 (✓ at index 2).  
- K is in the word but is NOT in position 5 (- at index 4).

So the secret word looks like: _ _ E _ _  
and must include K somewhere other than the last position.

Remaining common consonants that have not been tested yet:  
B, D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining common vowels: none except E is already placed.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Has E fixed at position 3.
2. Contains K somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.
3. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.

Candidate words:
- “BEGUM” – uses B, E, G, U, M (U already eliminated).  
- “DESKY” – uses D, E, S, K, Y (S already eliminated).  
- “HEMOK” – uses H, E, M, O, K (O already eliminated).  
- “WEDGE” – uses W, E, D, G, E (E is already fixed at position 3; this would place the second E at position 5, which is allowed because the feedback only said E is NOT in position 5 for the first guess, not necessarily that there is only one E). However, WEDGE repeats E, which might not be optimal for gaining new information.

A better choice is “WEDGE” because:
- E is in position 3 (matches ✓).  
- K is not used, but that’s okay because we only need to confirm K is in the word somewhere else.  
Wait, no—WEDGE doesn’t use K at all, so that’s bad.

Let’s try “KEBUM” – but this is not a valid English word.

Another valid word: “MEEKY” – uses M, E, E, K, Y.  
- E is in position 3 (✓).  
- K is in position 4 (allowed).  
- Uses M, Y which haven’t been tested, and K is confirmed present.

“MEEKY” is valid and fits all constraints.

But let me double-check:  
- M: not eliminated.  
- E: correct position.  
- E: second E is allowed (the first feedback only said E is not in position 5, not that there’s only one E).  
- K: in position 4 (allowed).  
- Y: not eliminated.

So “MEEKY” is a good next guess.

Actually, let me think of a word that uses K in position 1 or 2 instead of 4 to test more placements.  
“KEYED” – uses K, E, Y, E, D.  
- K in position 1 (good test).  
- E in position 3 (✓).  
- Y and D are fresh letters.  
- Second E is allowed.

“KEYED” seems better because it tests K in position 1 and introduces Y and D.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and common consonants. This should give us good feedback about which of these key letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another strong candidate is ""STARE"" (S, T, A, R, E), but ""AROSE"" has slightly better letter coverage. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a good mix of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x), R(x), O(x), S(x) → none of A, R, O, S are in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word contains an E somewhere other than the last letter.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes E (but not at position 5).
2. Excludes A, R, O, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, U, I, etc.

Let’s pick a word that uses E plus some of these remaining common letters. A good candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- U, N, T, I, E (none of A, R, O, S).
- E is in position 4, satisfying the feedback that E is in the word but not at position 5.

Another candidate could be ""ELITE"", but it repeats E, which isn't ideal for gaining new information. ""UNTIE"" gives us a fresh set of letters to test.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

   (So E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.)

We still need to test common consonants and vowels that have not been ruled out.  
Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining common vowels: none except E (since A, O, I, U are out).

A good next word should:
- contain E (and place it in one of the allowed positions),
- use fresh, high-frequency letters,
- avoid any already-eliminated letters.

Candidate words:
- “CHEEP” – uses C, H, E, E, P (but repeats E).
- “BLEED” – uses B, L, E, E, D (also repeats E).
- “MELON” – uses M, E, L, O, N (but O and N are already out).
- “FLECK” – uses F, L, E, C, K (all fresh letters, and E is in position 3).

“FLECK” meets all criteria:
- Contains E (position 3) – allowed by feedback.
- Uses F, L, C, K, none of which have been tested yet.
- Avoids every eliminated letter.

Therefore, “FLECK” is a strong next guess.

However, WEDGE repeats E, which might not be optimal for gaining new information.\n\nA better choice is “WEDGE” because:\n- E is in position 3 (matches ✓).  \n- K is not used, but that’s okay because we only need to confirm K is in the word somewhere else.  \nWait, no—WEDGE doesn’t use K at all, so that’s bad.\n\nLet’s try “KEBUM” – but this is not a valid English word.\n\nAnother valid word: “MEEKY” – uses M, E, E, K, Y.  \n- E is in position 3 (✓).  \n- K is in position 4 (allowed).  \n- Uses M, Y which haven’t been tested, and K is confirmed present.\n\n“MEEKY” is valid and fits all constraints.\n\nBut let me double-check:  \n- M: not eliminated.  \n- E: correct position.  \n- E: second E is allowed (the first feedback only said E is not in position 5, not that there’s only one E).  \n- K: in position 4 (allowed).  \n- Y: not eliminated.\n\nSo “MEEKY” is a good next guess.\n\nActually, let me think of a word that uses K in position 1 or 2 instead of 4 to test more placements.  \n“KEYED” – uses K, E, Y, E, D.  \n- K in position 1 (good test).  \n- E in position 3 (✓).  \n- Y and D are fresh letters.  \n- Second E is allowed.\n\n“KEYED” seems better because it tests K in position 1 and introduces Y and D.\n\n<guess>KEYED</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(-)\nGuess 3: FLECK -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(x) E(✓) C(x) K(-)\nGuess 4: KEYED -> FEEDBACK: K(-) E(✓) Y(-) E(-) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
   A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, F, L, C, D

2. Letters that ARE in the word:  
   - E is in position 3 (✓ at index 2)  
   - K is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 5 (from feedback on FLECK and KEYED)  
   - Y is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from KEYED feedback)

So the pattern is: _ _ E _ _  
and K must be in position 2 or 4, and Y must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Remaining unused common letters: B, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
- has E in position 3  
- contains both K and Y somewhere allowed  
- uses only letters not yet ruled out

Candidate words:
- “BEGUM” – U is out.  
- “JEWEL” – L and D are out.  
- “PEKYN” – N is out.  
- “WOKEN” – N and C are out.  
- “BEGGY” – G twice and Y twice, but G hasn’t been tested.  
- “BEGUM” – U out.  
- “PEKIN” – I and N out.  
- “JEWEL” – L and D out.  
- “PEKYN” – N out.  
- “WOKEN” – N, C, D out.  
- “BEGGY” – valid, uses B, E, G, G, Y.  
  - E in position 3 (✓).  
  - Y in position 5 (allowed).  
  - G in positions 2 and 4 (new letters).  
  - K is missing – this doesn’t satisfy the “must contain K” constraint.

We need a word with K.  
Let’s list possibilities with K in position 2 or 4:

- K in position 2: _ K E _ _  
  Possible: B K E _ _, G K E _ _, H K E _ _, M K E _ _, P K E _ _, V K E _ _, W K E _ _, Y K E _ _

  - “GROKE” – not a word.  
  - “HOTKE” – not a word.  
  - “MOKED” – D is out.  
  - “POKEN” – N is out.  
  - “WOKEN” – N is out.  
  - “YOKEL” – L is out.  

- K in position 4: _ _ E K _  
  Possible: B _ E K _, G _ E K _, H _ E K _, M _ E K _, P _ E K _, V _ E K _, W _ E K _, Y _ E K _  
  Valid English words:  
  - “BEGUM” – U out.  
  - “GEEKY” – uses G, E, E, K, Y.  
    - E in position 3 (✓).  
    - K in position 4 (allowed).  
    - Y in position 5 (allowed).  
    - G in position 2 (new letter).  
    - Second E in position 4 is allowed (only the first feedback said E not in position 5).  
    - All letters used are either confirmed present or not yet ruled out.  
  - “HEKKA” – A is out.  
  - “PEKKA” – A is out.  
  - “WEEKY” – E in position 2 conflicts with position 3 E.  
  - “YELKY” – L is out.  

“GEEKY” is the only valid English word that satisfies all constraints:
- E in position 3 (✓)  
- K in position 4 (allowed)  
- Y in position 5 (allowed)  
- G in position 2 (new letter)  
- All letters are either confirmed present or not yet ruled out.
