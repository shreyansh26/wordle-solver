### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

""RAISE"" uses R, A, I, S, E - which are all very common letters. This seems like a strong starting word to gather information about the secret word.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in the word and in position 2.
- I is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _ (A is fixed in position 2).
- It contains R and E somewhere, but R is not in position 1 and E is not in position 5.
- It does NOT contain I or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 2.
2. Contains R and E (with the positional constraints above).
3. Does not contain I or S.

Possible candidates:
- BREAD: A in position 2, contains R and E, no I or S. But E is in position 5, which is invalid (feedback says E is not in position 5).
- GRADE: A in position 2, contains R and E, no I or S. E is in position 5 again - invalid.
- CRANE: A in position 2, contains R and E, no I or S. E is in position 5 - invalid.
- FRAME: A in position 2, contains R and E, no I or S. E is in position 5 - invalid.
- DRAPE: A in position 2, contains R and E, no I or S. E is in position 5 - invalid.
- TREND: A is not in position 2 - invalid.
- BRAND: A in position 2, contains R and E? No E here - invalid.
- PARED: A in position 2, contains R and E, no I or S. E is in position 5 - invalid.
- HEART: A in position 2, contains R and E, no I or S. E is in position 5 - invalid.
- LEARN: A in position 2, contains R and E, no I or S. E is in position 5 - invalid.

Hmm, most words with A in position 2 and containing R and E tend to put E in position 5. Let me think differently - maybe the E is in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Possible words:
- E A _ _ _ : but E cannot be in position 1 if the word starts with E (feedback didn't say E can't be in position 1, just that it's not in position 5).
- _ A E _ _ : E in position 3.
- _ A _ E _ : E in position 4.

Let me think of words with A in position 2 and E in position 3 or 4, and R somewhere not in position 1.

Examples:
- C A E R _ : but needs to be 5 letters.
- P A R E D: A in position 2, R in position 3, E in position 4. This fits:
  - A in position 2 (✓ from feedback).
  - R is in the word, not in position 1 (it's in position 3 here) - this satisfies R(-) from feedback.
  - E is in the word, not in position 5 (it's in position 4 here) - this satisfies E(-) from feedback.
  - No I or S - good.
  - PARED is a valid word.

Let me check if there's a better word. Another option:
- T A R E D: A in position 2, R in position 3, E in position 4. Same as PARED but starts with T. Both are valid, but PARED uses P which is common.

I'll go with PARED as it fits all constraints.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern so far: P A _ E _
2. R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (because in PARED it was marked “-” while in position 3).
3. Letters NOT in the word: I, S, D.
4. Letters already placed: P (position 1), A (position 2), E (position 4).

So the missing letter (position 5) must be:
- A consonant (since all vowels except D are already placed or ruled out).
- Not R, I, S, or D.
- Common English letters left: N, T, L, C, M, Y, etc.

Also, R must appear somewhere in the word, but it cannot be in position 3. The only remaining spot for R is position 5. Therefore the word must be P A _ E R.

The blank (position 3) must be a consonant that has not been ruled out. Common choices: N, T, L, C, M, Y.

Looking at valid 5-letter words fitting P A _ E R:
- P A N E R → “P A N E R” is a valid word (a person who pans for gold).
- P A T E R → not a standard word.
- P A L E R → not standard.
- P A C E R → “PACE R” is not a word.
- P A M E R → not standard.
- P A Y E R → “PAYER” is valid (one who pays).

Between PANER and PAYER, PANER is more common in word lists. I’ll go with that.

Check constraints:
- P(✓), A(✓), E(✓) already match.
- R is in position 5 (allowed, since R was only ruled out of position 1 and 3).
- No I, S, D, or any other ruled-out letters.

The blank (position 3) must be a consonant that has not been ruled out. Common choices: N, T, L, C, M, Y.

Looking at valid 5-letter words fitting P A _ E R:
- P A N E R → “P A N E R” is a valid word (a person who pans for gold).

- P A Y E R → “PAYER” is valid (one who pays).

Between PANER and PAYER, PANER is more common in word lists. I’ll go with that.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

""RAISE"" uses R, A, I, S, E - which are all very common letters. This seems like a strong starting word to gather information about the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in the word and in position 2.
- I is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _ (A is fixed in position 2).
- It contains R and E somewhere, but R is not in position 1 and E is not in position 5.
- It does NOT contain I or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 2.
2. Contains R and E (with the positional constraints above).
3. Does not contain I or S.

Possible candidates:
- BREAD: A in position 2, contains R and E, no I or S. But E is in position 5, which is invalid (feedback says E is not in position 5).
- GRADE: A in position 2, contains R and E, no I or S. E is in position 5 again - invalid.
- CRANE: A in position 2, contains R and E, no I or S. E is in position 5 - invalid.
- FRAME: A in position 2, contains R and E, no I or S. E is in position 5 - invalid.
- DRAPE: A in position 2, contains R and E, no I or S. E is in position 5 - invalid.
- TREND: A is not in position 2 - invalid.
- BRAND: A in position 2, contains R and E? No E here - invalid.
- PARED: A in position 2, contains R and E, no I or S. E is in position 5 - invalid.
- HEART: A in position 2, contains R and E, no I or S. E is in position 5 - invalid.
- LEARN: A in position 2, contains R and E, no I or S. E is in position 5 - invalid.

Hmm, most words with A in position 2 and containing R and E tend to put E in position 5. Let me think differently - maybe the E is in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Possible words:
- E A _ _ _ : but E cannot be in position 1 if the word starts with E (feedback didn't say E can't be in position 1, just that it's not in position 5).
- _ A E _ _ : E in position 3.
- _ A _ E _ : E in position 4.

Let me think of words with A in position 2 and E in position 3 or 4, and R somewhere not in position 1.

Examples:
- C A E R _ : but needs to be 5 letters.
- P A R E D: A in position 2, R in position 3, E in position 4. This fits:
  - A in position 2 (✓ from feedback).
  - R is in the word, not in position 1 (it's in position 3 here) - this satisfies R(-) from feedback.
  - E is in the word, not in position 5 (it's in position 4 here) - this satisfies E(-) from feedback.
  - No I or S - good.
  - PARED is a valid word.

Let me check if there's a better word. Another option:
- T A R E D: A in position 2, R in position 3, E in position 4. Same as PARED but starts with T. Both are valid, but PARED uses P which is common.

I'll go with PARED as it fits all constraints.

4. Letters already placed: P (position 1), A (position 2), E (position 4).

So the missing letter (position 5) must be:

- Common English letters left: N, T, L, C, M, Y, etc.

  – Position 4: E

  – From all feedback so far, the letters we have ruled out are: I, S, D, N.
  – The letters already used (and therefore present) are P, A, E, R.

  The alphabet letters still allowed for position 3 are: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  – PABER  (not standard)  
  – PACER  (valid)  
  – PAGER  (valid)  
  – PAPER  (valid)  
  – PAPER is the most common word in English that fits.

Let’s verify PAPER against all feedback:

  – PAPER is a valid word.
  – P in position 3 has never been tested before, so we’re testing it now.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

""RAISE"" uses R, A, I, S, E - which are all very common letters. This seems like a strong starting word to gather information about the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is in the word and in position 2.
- I is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _ (A is fixed in position 2).
- It contains R and E somewhere, but R is not in position 1 and E is not in position 5.
- It does NOT contain I or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 2.
2. Contains R and E (with the positional constraints above).
3. Does not contain I or S.

Possible candidates:
- BREAD: A in position 2, contains R and E, no I or S. But E is in position 5, which is invalid (feedback says E is not in position 5).
- GRADE: A in position 2, contains R and E, no I or S. E is in position 5 again - invalid.
- CRANE: A in position 2, contains R and E, no I or S. E is in position 5 - invalid.
- FRAME: A in position 2, contains R and E, no I or S. E is in position 5 - invalid.
- DRAPE: A in position 2, contains R and E, no I or S. E is in position 5 - invalid.
- TREND: A is not in position 2 - invalid.
- BRAND: A in position 2, contains R and E? No E here - invalid.
- PARED: A in position 2, contains R and E, no I or S. E is in position 5 - invalid.
- HEART: A in position 2, contains R and E, no I or S. E is in position 5 - invalid.
- LEARN: A in position 2, contains R and E, no I or S. E is in position 5 - invalid.

Hmm, most words with A in position 2 and containing R and E tend to put E in position 5. Let me think differently - maybe the E is in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Possible words:
- E A _ _ _ : but E cannot be in position 1 if the word starts with E (feedback didn't say E can't be in position 1, just that it's not in position 5).
- _ A E _ _ : E in position 3.
- _ A _ E _ : E in position 4.

Let me think of words with A in position 2 and E in position 3 or 4, and R somewhere not in position 1.

Examples:
- C A E R _ : but needs to be 5 letters.
- P A R E D: A in position 2, R in position 3, E in position 4. This fits:
  - A in position 2 (✓ from feedback).
  - R is in the word, not in position 1 (it's in position 3 here) - this satisfies R(-) from feedback.
  - E is in the word, not in position 5 (it's in position 4 here) - this satisfies E(-) from feedback.
  - No I or S - good.
  - PARED is a valid word.

Let me check if there's a better word. Another option:
- T A R E D: A in position 2, R in position 3, E in position 4. Same as PARED but starts with T. Both are valid, but PARED uses P which is common.

I'll go with PARED as it fits all constraints.

Guess 2: PARED -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Pattern so far: P A _ E _
2. R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (because in PARED it was marked “-” while in position 3).
3. Letters NOT in the word: I, S, D.
4. Letters already placed: P (position 1), A (position 2), E (position 4).

So the missing letter (position 5) must be:
- A consonant (since all vowels except D are already placed or ruled out).
- Not R, I, S, or D.
- Common English letters left: N, T, L, C, M, Y, etc.

Also, R must appear somewhere in the word, but it cannot be in position 3. The only remaining spot for R is position 5. Therefore the word must be P A _ E R.

The blank (position 3) must be a consonant that has not been ruled out. Common choices: N, T, L, C, M, Y.

Looking at valid 5-letter words fitting P A _ E R:
- P A N E R → “P A N E R” is a valid word (a person who pans for gold).
- P A T E R → not a standard word.
- P A L E R → not standard.
- P A C E R → “PACE R” is not a word.
- P A M E R → not standard.
- P A Y E R → “PAYER” is valid (one who pays).

Between PANER and PAYER, PANER is more common in word lists. I’ll go with that.

Check constraints:
- P(✓), A(✓), E(✓) already match.
- R is in position 5 (allowed, since R was only ruled out of position 1 and 3).
- No I, S, D, or any other ruled-out letters.

  – Therefore the word is of the form P A _ E R

  – From all feedback so far, the letters we have ruled out are: I, S, D, N.
  – The letters already used (and therefore present) are P, A, E, R.

  The alphabet letters still allowed for position 3 are: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

  – PABER  (not standard)  
  – PACER  (valid)  
  – PAGER  (valid)  
  – PAPER  (valid)  
  – PAPER is the most common word in English that fits.

E is in position 5 - invalid.\n\nHmm, most words with A in position 2 and containing R and E tend to put E in position 5. Let me think differently - maybe the E is in positions 1, 3, or 4.\n\nPossible words:\n- E A _ _ _ : but E cannot be in position 1 if the word starts with E (feedback didn't say E can't be in position 1, just that it's not in position 5).\n- _ A E _ _ : E in position 3.\n- _ A _ E _ : E in position 4.\n\nLet me think of words with A in position 2 and E in position 3 or 4, and R somewhere not in position 1.\n\nExamples:\n- C A E R _ : but needs to be 5 letters.\n- P A R E D: A in position 2, R in position 3, E in position 4. This fits:\n  - A in position 2 (✓ from feedback).\n  - R is in the word, not in position 1 (it's in position 3 here) - this satisfies R(-) from feedback.\n  - E is in the word, not in position 5 (it's in position 4 here) - this satisfies E(-) from feedback.\n  - No I or S - good.\n  - PARED is a valid word.\n\nLet me check if there's a better word. Another option:\n- T A R E D: A in position 2, R in position 3, E in position 4. Same as PARED but starts with T. Both are valid, but PARED uses P which is common.\n\nI'll go with PARED as it fits all constraints.\n\n<guess>PARED</guess>""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: PARED -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two rounds of feedback we now know:\n\n1.
