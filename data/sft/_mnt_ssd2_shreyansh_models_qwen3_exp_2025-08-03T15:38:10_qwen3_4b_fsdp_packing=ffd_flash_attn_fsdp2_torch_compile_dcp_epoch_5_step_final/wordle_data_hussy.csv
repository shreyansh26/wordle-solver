For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, providing valuable feedback for subsequent guesses.

Another strong contender is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency distribution for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the correct position (last letter).
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word ends with S.
2. The letters A, R, O, E are excluded.
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels (I, U, T, L, N, etc.).

A good next guess should:
- Keep S in the 5th position.
- Introduce new common letters not yet tested.
- Avoid A, R, O, E.

A strong candidate is ""WISPS"" (W, I, S, P, S), but since S is already fixed at the end, we can try ""WISPS"" or ""TIPS"". However, ""TIPS"" only has 4 unique letters. A better choice is ""WISPS"" as it tests W, I, P, S.

But to maximize information, let's choose ""WISPS"" because it tests 3 new letters (W, I, P) while keeping S in place.

Wait, let me think of another word that uses more new letters. ""LUSTS"" would test L, U, S, T, S - but S is already known. ""MUSTS"" tests M, U, S, T, S. ""PULPS"" tests P, U, L, P, S. 

Actually, ""PULPS"" is good but has P twice. ""WISPS"" is better as it has unique letters. 

I'll go with ""WISPS"" as it introduces W, I, P, S (with S already known).

But let me reconsider - maybe ""WISPS"" isn't optimal. A better approach is to test more distinct letters. 

Looking at remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, U, C, D, H, etc. 

A word like ""UNTIL"" would be good but ends with L, not S. 

Since we know the word ends with S, let's try ""UNTIS"" but that's not a valid word. 

Valid words ending with S: ""TULIP S"" - no. ""LUNIS"" - no. 

Let me think of valid words ending with S that avoid A, R, O, E. 

Good options: ""TULIS"" (invalid), ""LUNIS"" (invalid), ""CUPID S"" - no. 

Actually, ""LUNIS"" isn't valid. Let me think differently - common words ending with S: ""WISPS"", ""MUSTS"", ""PULPS"", ""TULPS"", ""LUNGS"" (but has G), ""CUPIDS"" (but ends with S? No, ends with S). 

""WISPS"" seems the best among valid words. 

But let me check ""LUNDS"" - invalid. 

Another valid word: ""LUNGS"" - but has G, and we haven't tested G yet. 

Actually, ""LUNGS"" is valid but has G. 

Let me choose ""LUNGS"" as it tests L, U, N, G, S. 

But since we know S is fixed at the end, ""LUNGS"" would be G in 4th position, but we don't know about G.

- The word ends with S.
- A, R, O, E are not in the word.

- Letters to exclude so far: A, R, O, E, W, I, P.
- Letters to keep: S (twice: once at position 5, once somewhere else).
- Remaining common letters to test: T, N, L, U, C, D, M, B, G, H, etc.

- It ends in S (✓).
- It has an S in position 2 (so the second S is not in position 4, satisfying the feedback).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, providing valuable feedback for subsequent guesses.

Another strong contender is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency distribution for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the correct position (last letter).
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word ends with S.
2. The letters A, R, O, E are excluded.
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels (I, U, T, L, N, etc.).

A good next guess should:
- Keep S in the 5th position.
- Introduce new common letters not yet tested.
- Avoid A, R, O, E.

A strong candidate is ""WISPS"" (W, I, S, P, S), but since S is already fixed at the end, we can try ""WISPS"" or ""TIPS"". However, ""TIPS"" only has 4 unique letters. A better choice is ""WISPS"" as it tests W, I, P, S.

But to maximize information, let's choose ""WISPS"" because it tests 3 new letters (W, I, P) while keeping S in place.

Wait, let me think of another word that uses more new letters. ""LUSTS"" would test L, U, S, T, S - but S is already known. ""MUSTS"" tests M, U, S, T, S. ""PULPS"" tests P, U, L, P, S. 

Actually, ""PULPS"" is good but has P twice. ""WISPS"" is better as it has unique letters. 

I'll go with ""WISPS"" as it introduces W, I, P, S (with S already known).

But let me reconsider - maybe ""WISPS"" isn't optimal. A better approach is to test more distinct letters. 

Looking at remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, U, C, D, H, etc. 

A word like ""UNTIL"" would be good but ends with L, not S. 

Since we know the word ends with S, let's try ""UNTIS"" but that's not a valid word. 

Valid words ending with S: ""TULIP S"" - no. ""LUNIS"" - no. 

Let me think of valid words ending with S that avoid A, R, O, E. 

Good options: ""TULIS"" (invalid), ""LUNIS"" (invalid), ""CUPID S"" - no. 

Actually, ""LUNIS"" isn't valid. Let me think differently - common words ending with S: ""WISPS"", ""MUSTS"", ""PULPS"", ""TULPS"", ""LUNGS"" (but has G), ""CUPIDS"" (but ends with S? No, ends with S). 

""WISPS"" seems the best among valid words. 

But let me check ""LUNDS"" - invalid. 

Another valid word: ""LUNGS"" - but has G, and we haven't tested G yet. 

Actually, ""LUNGS"" is valid but has G. 

Let me choose ""LUNGS"" as it tests L, U, N, G, S. 

But since we know S is fixed at the end, ""LUNGS"" would be G in 4th position, but we don't know about G. 

This seems better: ""LUNGS"" tests L, U, N, G, S. 

But let me think of a word with more common letters. ""TULIS"" isn't valid. 

""WISPS"" is valid and tests W, I, P, S (with S known). 

I'll go with ""WISPS"" as it's a valid word and introduces 3 new letters (W, I, P) while keeping S in place.

Guess 2: WISPS -> FEEDBACK: W(x) I(x) S(✓) P(x) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on WISPS:
- S is still correct in position 5 (✓).
- The second S is in the word but in the wrong position (–).  
  This means the word has exactly two S’s: one at the end and one elsewhere, and that other S cannot be in position 4.

From the first guess (AROSE) we already knew:
- The word ends with S.
- A, R, O, E are not in the word.

Combining these:
- Letters to exclude so far: A, R, O, E, W, I, P.
- Letters to keep: S (twice: once at position 5, once somewhere else).
- Remaining common letters to test: T, N, L, U, C, D, M, B, G, H, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains exactly one more S somewhere in positions 1-4 and uses none of the excluded letters.  
A good candidate is “MUSTS”:
- It ends in S (✓).
- It has an S in position 2 (so the second S is not in position 4, satisfying the feedback).
- It introduces M, U, T (all still untested and none excluded).

Therefore, “MUSTS” is a strong next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common letters to quickly narrow down possibilities. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, providing valuable feedback for subsequent guesses.

Another strong contender is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency distribution for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- S is in the correct position (last letter).
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word ends with S.
2. The letters A, R, O, E are excluded.
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels (I, U, T, L, N, etc.).

A good next guess should:
- Keep S in the 5th position.
- Introduce new common letters not yet tested.
- Avoid A, R, O, E.

A strong candidate is ""WISPS"" (W, I, S, P, S), but since S is already fixed at the end, we can try ""WISPS"" or ""TIPS"". However, ""TIPS"" only has 4 unique letters. A better choice is ""WISPS"" as it tests W, I, P, S.

But to maximize information, let's choose ""WISPS"" because it tests 3 new letters (W, I, P) while keeping S in place.

Wait, let me think of another word that uses more new letters. ""LUSTS"" would test L, U, S, T, S - but S is already known. ""MUSTS"" tests M, U, S, T, S. ""PULPS"" tests P, U, L, P, S. 

Actually, ""PULPS"" is good but has P twice. ""WISPS"" is better as it has unique letters. 

I'll go with ""WISPS"" as it introduces W, I, P, S (with S already known).

But let me reconsider - maybe ""WISPS"" isn't optimal. A better approach is to test more distinct letters. 

Looking at remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, U, C, D, H, etc. 

A word like ""UNTIL"" would be good but ends with L, not S. 

Since we know the word ends with S, let's try ""UNTIS"" but that's not a valid word. 

Valid words ending with S: ""TULIP S"" - no. ""LUNIS"" - no. 

Let me think of valid words ending with S that avoid A, R, O, E. 

Good options: ""TULIS"" (invalid), ""LUNIS"" (invalid), ""CUPID S"" - no. 

Actually, ""LUNIS"" isn't valid. Let me think differently - common words ending with S: ""WISPS"", ""MUSTS"", ""PULPS"", ""TULPS"", ""LUNGS"" (but has G), ""CUPIDS"" (but ends with S? No, ends with S). 

""WISPS"" seems the best among valid words. 

But let me check ""LUNDS"" - invalid. 

Another valid word: ""LUNGS"" - but has G, and we haven't tested G yet. 

Actually, ""LUNGS"" is valid but has G. 

Let me choose ""LUNGS"" as it tests L, U, N, G, S. 

But since we know S is fixed at the end, ""LUNGS"" would be G in 4th position, but we don't know about G. 

This seems better: ""LUNGS"" tests L, U, N, G, S. 

But let me think of a word with more common letters. ""TULIS"" isn't valid. 

""WISPS"" is valid and tests W, I, P, S (with S known). 

I'll go with ""WISPS"" as it's a valid word and introduces 3 new letters (W, I, P) while keeping S in place.

Guess 2: WISPS -> FEEDBACK: W(x) I(x) S(✓) P(x) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on WISPS:
- S is still correct in position 5 (✓).
- The second S is in the word but in the wrong position (–).  
  This means the word has exactly two S’s: one at the end and one elsewhere, and that other S cannot be in position 4.

From the first guess (AROSE) we already knew:
- The word ends with S.
- A, R, O, E are not in the word.

Combining these:
- Letters to exclude so far: A, R, O, E, W, I, P.
- Letters to keep: S (twice: once at position 5, once somewhere else).
- Remaining common letters to test: T, N, L, U, C, D, M, B, G, H, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains exactly one more S somewhere in positions 1-4 and uses none of the excluded letters.  
A good candidate is “MUSTS”:
- It ends in S (✓).
- It has an S in position 2 (so the second S is not in position 4, satisfying the feedback).
- It introduces M, U, T (all still untested and none excluded).

Therefore, “MUSTS” is a strong next guess.

So far the pattern is: _ U S _ S

Remaining unused common letters: N, L, C, D, B, G, H, F, K, Y, V, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting _ U S _ S.  
Possible candidates:  
- BUSKS – but K is less common and B is untested  
- DUSKS – valid word, tests D and K  
- FUSKS – F is untested but less common  
- GUSKS – G is untested but K is uncommon

""TULIS"" isn\'t valid. \n\n""WISPS"" is valid and tests W, I, P, S (with S known). \n\nI\'ll go with ""WISPS"" as it\'s a valid word and introduces 3 new letters (W, I, P) while keeping S in place.\n\n<guess>WISPS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: WISPS -> FEEDBACK: W(x) I(x) S(✓) P(x) S(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback on WISPS:\n- S is still correct in position 5 (✓).\n- The second S is in the word but in the wrong position (–).  \n  This means the word has exactly two S’s: one at the end and one elsewhere, and that other S cannot be in position 4.\n\nFrom the first guess (AROSE) we already knew:\n- The word ends with S.\n- A, R, O, E are not in the word.\n\nCombining these:\n- Letters to exclude so far: A, R, O, E, W, I, P.\n- Letters to keep: S (twice: once at position 5, once somewhere else).\n- Remaining common letters to test: T, N, L, U, C, D, M, B, G, H, etc.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains exactly one more S somewhere in positions 1-4 and uses none of the excluded letters.  \nA good candidate is “MUSTS”:\n- It ends in S (✓).\n- It has an S in position 2 (so the second S is not in position 4, satisfying the feedback).\n- It introduces M, U, T (all still untested and none excluded).\n\nTherefore, “MUSTS” is a strong next guess.\n\n<guess>MUSTS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: WISPS -> FEEDBACK: W(x) I(x) S(✓) P(x) S(-)\nGuess 3: MUSTS -> FEEDBACK: M(x) U(✓) S(✓) T(x) S(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Current constraints:\n- Word ends with S (position 5 = ✓)\n- Contains exactly one additional S in positions 1-4 (feedback from MUSTS shows S in position 3 is ✓, so that extra S must be in position 3)\n- U is in the word and in the correct position 2 (✓)\n- Letters already excluded: A, R, O, E, W, I, P, M, T\n\nSo far the pattern is: _ U S _ S\n\nRemaining unused common letters: N, L, C, D, B, G, H, F, K, Y, V, etc.\n\nWe need a valid 5-letter word fitting _ U S _ S.  \nPossible candidates:  \n- BUSKS – but K is less common and B is untested  \n- DUSKS – valid word, tests D and K  \n- FUSKS – F is untested but less common  \n- GUSKS – G is untested but K is uncommon  \n\nThe most straightforward valid word is ""DUSKS"" – it tests D and K while fitting the pattern perfectly.\n\n<guess>DUSKS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: WISPS -> FEEDBACK: W(x) I(x) S(✓) P(x) S(-)\nGuess 3: MUSTS -> FEEDBACK: M(x) U(✓) S(✓) T(x) S(-)\nGuess 4: DUSKS -> FEEDBACK: D(x) U(✓) S(✓) K(x) S(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback so far:\n\n1.

From the feedback on GUSHS:
- U is still correct in position 2 (✓)
- S is correct in position 3 (✓)
- H is in the word but in the wrong position (–) — so H must appear somewhere else in the word
- The last S is correct in position 5 (✓)
- G is not in the word (x)

Current pattern: _ U S _ S
Letters known to be in the word: U, S, S, H
Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, E, W, I, P, M, T, D, K, G

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has the form _ U S _ S
- Contains H exactly once (since we only have one extra S to place)
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Possible letters left: B, C, F, L, N, V, Y, etc.

Looking for valid words:

Valid words ending in S with the pattern _ U S _ S:

Wait, let’s list all valid English 5-letter words that fit _ U S _ S:
1. FUSKS – K excluded
2. GUSHS – G excluded
3. HUSKS – K excluded
4. LUSKS – K excluded
5. NUSKS – K excluded
6. BUSHY – doesn’t end in S
7. CUSHY – doesn’t end in S
8. DUSKS – D excluded
9. MUSTS – M excluded
10. WISPS – W excluded

Hmm, it appears all common words fitting _ U S _ S have been excluded due to K, D, M, W, G, etc.  
But we still have B, C, F, L, N, V, Y left.

Let me check if any of these form valid words:
- BUSHY – doesn’t end in S
- FUSYY – doesn’t end in S
- LUSIS – I excluded
- NUSIS – I excluded
- CUSHY – doesn’t end in S

Actually, the pattern _ U S _ S is quite restrictive.  
Let me re-examine possible letters and valid words:

Valid letters left: B, C, F, L, N, V, Y, H

We need _ U S _ S with H somewhere in positions 1 or 4.

Possible combinations:
1. H U S _ S – but we already have S in position 3, and we only have one extra S, so position 4 would need to be H
   - H U S H S – valid word: HUSH S (but HUSH is 4 letters)
   - H U S V S – invalid
   - H U S N S – invalid
   - H U S B S – invalid

2. _ U S H S – where the first letter is from remaining options
   - B U S H S – valid word: BUSH S (but BUSH is 4 letters)
   - C U S H S – valid word: CUSH S (but CUSH is 4 letters)
   - F U S H S – valid word: FUSH S (but FUSH is 4 letters)
   - L U S H S – valid word: LUSH S (but LUSH is 4 letters)
   - N U S H S – valid word: NUSH S (but NUSH is 4 letters)
   - V U S H S – invalid
   - Y U S H S – invalid

None of these are standard 5-letter English words.  
However, ""LUSH S"" is not a word, but ""LUSHES"" is a valid 6-letter word.  
Similarly, ""BUSHES"", ""CUSHES"", ""FUSHES"" do not exist.

Wait, let me think differently – maybe the extra S is not in position 3 but in position 1 or 4, and we misinterpreted the feedback.

Re-examining feedback:
- Guess 3: MUSTS -> M(x) U(✓) S(✓) T(x) S(-)
  - The last S was ✓ in position 5, but the second S (position 4) was –, meaning there is another S elsewhere.

But in MUSTS, the S in position 3 was ✓, so that S is fixed in position 3.  
Thus the pattern must be _ U S _ S with the extra S already placed in position 3, making the word have S in positions 3 and 5.

Therefore, the word is _ U S _ S and must contain H somewhere in positions 1 or 4.

The only valid English word fitting this is ""FUSHS"" (but G is excluded, F is allowed, U, S, H, S), but G is excluded, but F is allowed.

Wait, G is excluded, but F is allowed.  
""FUSHS"" is not a standard word.

Looking back, the only remaining valid word seems to be ""LUSH S"" which doesn't exist.  
This suggests we might have missed an earlier candidate.

But reviewing the pattern _ U S _ S with remaining letters:
- B, C, F, L, N, V, Y, H

The word must be _ U S _ S with H in position 1 or 4.

Possible valid words:
- BUSHY – doesn’t end in S
- CUSHY – doesn’t end in S
- LUSHY – doesn’t end in S
- NUSHY – doesn’t end in S
- FUSHS – invalid
- LUSHS – invalid

It appears the only valid word left is ""LUSH S"" which is non-existent.  
This indicates we might have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Re-examining Guess 5 (GUSHS):
- G(x) – G not in word
- U(✓) – U in position 2
- S(✓) – S in position 3
- H(-) – H in word but not in position 4
- S(-) – S in word but not in position 5 (but we know from earlier S is in position 5, so this feedback seems contradictory)

Wait, the feedback for GUSHS shows:
- Position 5 S is ✓ (correct)
- Position 4 H is – (in word but wrong position)
- Position 3 S is ✓ (correct)
- Position 2 U is ✓ (correct)
- Position 1 G is x (not in word)

So the word must be:
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: S
- Position 5: S
- Contains H somewhere in positions 1 or 4 (since H is in word but position 4 is wrong, so H must be in position 1)

Thus the pattern is: H U S _ S

Looking for valid 5-letter words H U S _ S:
- HUSKS – K excluded
- HUSIS – I excluded
- HUSYS – doesn’t exist
- HUSHS – valid word: HUSHS (rare but valid)

""HUSHS"" is a valid English word (plural of hush, though rare).

Let me check if any other letters fit:
- H U S B S – invalid
- H U S N S – invalid
- H U S V S – invalid
- H U S Y S – invalid

Thus, the only remaining valid word is ""HUSHS"".
