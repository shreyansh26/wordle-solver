For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically contain frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE uses A, R, O, S, E
- ADIEU uses A, D, I, E, U

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the word:
- Contains A, but NOT in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

Next, I want to:
1. Keep the A but move it to a different position (1, 2, 4, or 5).
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoid S, L, T, E.

Good consonants not yet tested: R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.
Good vowels not yet tested: I, O, U.

A strong candidate is “CRANK”:
- C, R, N, K are new letters.
- A is moved to position 2 (from position 3 in SLATE).
- No S, L, T, E.

Another candidate is “MARCH”:
- M, R, C, H are new letters.
- A is moved to position 2.

I’ll choose “CRANK” because it hits several common consonants and keeps the A in a new position.

We need a 5-letter word with:

We have to place G and D in the remaining four positions (1,3,4,5) while avoiding duplicates of already excluded letters.

Candidate words:
- BADGY – uses B, A, D, G, Y → all letters still possible, positions: D in 3, G in 4 (both not in original positions)
- DADGY – repeats D, which might be acceptable but less informative
- MADGY – uses M, A, D, G, Y → same as BADGY but with M instead of B

Let’s choose FADIG.

Check: F, A, D, I, G  
- A is in position 2 (✓)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically contain frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE uses A, R, O, S, E
- ADIEU uses A, D, I, E, U

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the word:
- Contains A, but NOT in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

Next, I want to:
1. Keep the A but move it to a different position (1, 2, 4, or 5).
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoid S, L, T, E.

Good consonants not yet tested: R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.
Good vowels not yet tested: I, O, U.

A strong candidate is “CRANK”:
- C, R, N, K are new letters.
- A is moved to position 2 (from position 3 in SLATE).
- No S, L, T, E.

Another candidate is “MARCH”:
- M, R, C, H are new letters.
- A is moved to position 2.

I’ll choose “CRANK” because it hits several common consonants and keeps the A in a new position.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K  
Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions): A (from both guesses, always in position 3, so A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5)

So far the word must contain A, and may not contain S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, O, U.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains A (but not in position 3)
- avoids all the letters we’ve ruled out
- introduces new, still-possible letters

Candidate words:
- MARCH – uses M, A, R, C, H → R and C already ruled out
- DRAFT – uses D, R, A, F, T → R and T already ruled out
- BANDA – uses B, A, N, D, A → N already ruled out
- GAMMA – uses G, A, M, M, A → M is still possible, but we’d prefer new consonants
- MADAM – uses M, A, D, A, M → D is possible, but repeats A and M
- BADLY – uses B, A, D, L, Y → L already ruled out
- PAGOD – uses P, A, G, O, D → all letters still possible, A not in position 3
- FADIG – uses F, A, D, I, G → all letters still possible, A not in position 3

Between PAGOD and FADIG, PAGOD introduces P, G, O, D while keeping A in position 2 (so not position 3). This seems like the best information-gathering choice.

We have to place G and D in the remaining four positions (1,3,4,5) while avoiding duplicates of already excluded letters.

Candidate words:

- DADGY – repeats D, which might be acceptable but less informative
- MADGY – uses M, A, D, G, Y → same as BADGY but with M instead of B

We need to place D and G plus one more letter (from B, H, M, V, W, Y, Z) in the remaining four slots (1,3,4,5), ensuring no duplicates of excluded letters.

Possible combinations:
- Position 1: D or G
- Positions 3,4,5: must include both G and D (in new positions) plus one more letter.

Let’s list possible words:
1. D A G _ _ – but G would be in position 3 (was position 5 before, allowed), need two more letters from B, H, M, V, W, Y, Z. Example: DAGMY (invalid, M and Y allowed, but DAGMY not a word).
2. G A D _ _ – D in position 3 (was position 5 before, allowed). Example: GADMY (not a word).
3. _ A D G _ – D in 3, G in 4. Example: BADGY (B allowed, Y allowed) – this is a valid word.
4. _ A G D _ – G in 3, D in 4. Example: MAGDY (M allowed, Y allowed) – but MAGDY is not a word.
5. _ A _ D G – D in 4, G in 5. Example: MADYG (not a word).
6. _ A _ G D – G in 4, D in 5. Example: BADGM (not a word).

The only valid English word fitting these constraints is BADGY:
- B, A, D, G, Y
- A in position 2 (✓)
- D in position 3 (was position 5 before, now new position)
- G in position 4 (was position 5 before, now new position)

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically contain frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE uses A, R, O, S, E
- ADIEU uses A, D, I, E, U

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the word:
- Contains A, but NOT in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

Next, I want to:
1. Keep the A but move it to a different position (1, 2, 4, or 5).
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoid S, L, T, E.

Good consonants not yet tested: R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.
Good vowels not yet tested: I, O, U.

A strong candidate is “CRANK”:
- C, R, N, K are new letters.
- A is moved to position 2 (from position 3 in SLATE).
- No S, L, T, E.

Another candidate is “MARCH”:
- M, R, C, H are new letters.
- A is moved to position 2.

I’ll choose “CRANK” because it hits several common consonants and keeps the A in a new position.

Guess 2: CRANK -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K  
Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions): A (from both guesses, always in position 3, so A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5)

So far the word must contain A, and may not contain S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, O, U.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains A (but not in position 3)
- avoids all the letters we’ve ruled out
- introduces new, still-possible letters

Candidate words:
- MARCH – uses M, A, R, C, H → R and C already ruled out
- DRAFT – uses D, R, A, F, T → R and T already ruled out
- BANDA – uses B, A, N, D, A → N already ruled out
- GAMMA – uses G, A, M, M, A → M is still possible, but we’d prefer new consonants
- MADAM – uses M, A, D, A, M → D is possible, but repeats A and M
- BADLY – uses B, A, D, L, Y → L already ruled out
- PAGOD – uses P, A, G, O, D → all letters still possible, A not in position 3
- FADIG – uses F, A, D, I, G → all letters still possible, A not in position 3

Between PAGOD and FADIG, PAGOD introduces P, G, O, D while keeping A in position 2 (so not position 3). This seems like the best information-gathering choice.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)

Guess 3: PAGOD -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) G(-) O(x) D(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on PAGOD:

P(x) – P is not in the word.  
A(✓) – A is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).  
G(-) – G is in the word but in the wrong position.  
O(x) – O is not in the word.  
D(-) – D is in the word but in the wrong position.

So far we know:

- Position 2 is A.
- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K, P, O.
- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): G, D.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A fixed in position 2.
- Must contain both G and D somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
- Must not use any of the ruled-out letters.

Possible remaining consonants: B, F, H, I, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already used and O, E are out).

We have to place G and D in the remaining four positions (1,3,4,5) while avoiding duplicates of already excluded letters.

Candidate words:
- BADGY – uses B, A, D, G, Y → all letters still possible, positions: D in 3, G in 4 (both not in original positions)
- DADGY – repeats D, which might be acceptable but less informative
- MADGY – uses M, A, D, G, Y → same as BADGY but with M instead of B
- GADID – uses G, A, D, I, D → repeats D
- GADID is invalid because D is repeated and we don’t know if duplicates are allowed.
- BADLY – L is already excluded
- FADIG – I is still possible, but G is in position 4 (allowed), D in 3 (allowed)
- FADIG: F, A, D, I, G → positions: D in 3, G in 5 (both allowed)

Between BADGY and FADIG, BADGY introduces B and Y, while FADIG introduces F and I. Both are good, but FADIG spreads the new letters more evenly.

Let’s choose FADIG.

Check: F, A, D, I, G  
- A is in position 2 (✓)  
- D is in position 3 (was in position 5 before, so new position)  
- G is in position 4 (was in position 3 before, so new position)  
- F and I are new letters not yet tested.  
- No excluded letters are used.

So the next guess is FADIG.

And it must contain both D and G somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since positions 2 and 5 are fixed).

Letters already ruled out: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K, P, O, F, I, B  
Remaining consonants: H, M, V, W, Z  
Remaining vowel: U (only one left, but we already have A and Y)

We need to place D and G plus one more letter (from H, M, V, W, Z) in positions 1, 3, 4, with D and G not in their previous positions.

Possible positions:
- D cannot be in position 3 (from CRANK/PAGOD/FADIG)  
- G cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from PAGOD/FADIG)  
- D cannot be in position 4 (from BADGY)  
- G cannot be in position 4 (from BADGY)

So:
- D can be in positions 1 or 4 (but 4 is now excluded for D because in BADGY D was in 3 and now 4 is allowed, but feedback says D is in wrong position, so 4 is allowed, but we need to check if it's correct)
Wait, let's re-examine:
From CRANK: D was in position 5 (wrong), so allowed in 1,2,3,4
From PAGOD: D was in position 5 (wrong), same
From FADIG: D was in position 3 (wrong), so now D cannot be in 3
From BADGY: D was in position 3 (wrong), same
So D is allowed in positions 1, 2, 4, 5, but 2 and 5 are fixed as A and Y, so D must be in 1 or 4

Similarly for G:
From PAGOD: G was in position 3 (wrong), so allowed 1,2,4,5
From FADIG: G was in position 5 (wrong), so allowed 1,2,3,4
From BADGY: G was in position 4 (wrong), so allowed 1,2,3
But 2 is A, so G must be in 1, 3

So possible placements:
- D must be in 1 or 4
- G must be in 1, 3
- And we need one more letter from H, M, V, W, Z

Let's list possibilities:

Case 1: D in 1
Word pattern: D A G _ Y
Need a letter for position 4 from H, M, V, W, Z
Valid words: DAGHY (not a word), DAGMY (not a word), DAGVY (not a word), DAGWY (not a word), DAGZY (not a word)
None seem valid.

Case 2: D in 4
Word pattern: _ A _ D Y
Now G must be in 1 or 3
Subcase 2a: G in 1
Word: G A _ D Y
Need a letter for position 3 from H, M, V, W, Z
Possible words: GAHDY (not a word), GAMDY (not a word), GAVDY (not a word), GAWDY (valid word), GAZDY (not a word)
GAWDY is a valid word.

Subcase 2b: G in 3
Word: _ A G D Y
Need a letter for position 1 from H, M, V, W, Z
Possible words: HA G D Y (HAGDY not a word), MAGDY (not a word), VAGDY (not a word), WAGDY (not a word), ZAGDY (not a word)
None seem valid.

Thus the only valid word is GAWDY.

<guess>GAWDY</guess>",GAWDY,"From the latest feedback on BADGY:

B(x) – B is not in the word.  
A(✓) – A is confirmed in position 2.  
D(-) – D is in the word but in the wrong position (was in position 3, now must be 1, 4, or 5).  
G(-) – G is in the word but in the wrong position (was in position 4, now must be 1, 3, or 5).  
Y(✓) – Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the word must be: _ A _ _ Y  
And it must contain both D and G somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since positions 2 and 5 are fixed).
