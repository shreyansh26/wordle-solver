### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc. After analyzing common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes L (but not in position 2)

3. Uses only remaining common letters to maximize information

Good remaining consonants: R, N, D, C, H, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out)

Let’s try a word that places L in a different position and introduces new common letters. ""FLING"" is a strong candidate:
- F: new letter
- L: in the word (position 2 in FLING, so if it's not correct there, it must be elsewhere)
- I: new vowel

This covers several new letters while respecting the constraints.

Good starting words often include letters like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc. After analyzing common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:\n- S (very common starting letter)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (common vowel)\n- T (common consonant)\n- E (most common vowel)\n\nThis combination gives us good coverage of frequent letters and positions.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n- S is NOT in the word (x)\n- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)\n- A, T, E are NOT in the word (x)\n\nSo we now know:\n- The word contains L, but not in position 2.\n- The word does NOT contain S, A, T, E.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that:\n1.

From the latest feedback on FILCH:
- F is correct in position 1.
- I is correct in position 2.
- L is correct in position 3.
- C and H are not in the word.

So the word now looks like: F I L _ _

We need a 5-letter word that starts with ""FIL"" and ends with two letters that have not been ruled out yet.  
Letters already excluded: S, A, T, E, N, G, C, H.  
Remaining common consonants: D, M, P, R, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: O, U.

Possible endings:
- FILM_ → FILMY (but Y is sometimes a vowel/consonant, and we haven't tested it yet)
- FILP_ → no common words
- FILR_ → no common words
- FILU_ → no common words
- FILD_ → no common words

The only common word that fits is ""FILMY"".  
Let's check:
- F I L M Y
- All letters are allowed (Y hasn't been excluded)
- It's a valid English word.

Therefore, the next guess should be FILMY.
