For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, T, L, N, S, etc. 

Some popular first guesses are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O - very vowel-heavy)

Among these, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's widely considered one of the best starting words due to its mix of common consonants and vowels, and its ability to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters.

From all feedback so far:

1. S is locked in position 1.
2. A is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (it was ""-"" in positions 2, 3, and 4).  
   Therefore A must be in position 5.
3. N is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from SNAKY and SCRAM).  
   So N must be in position 4 (since position 5 is now locked as A).
4. Letters definitely absent: L, T, E, K, Y, C, R, M.
5. Remaining consonants to test: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, V, W, X, Z (but we need common ones).

So the pattern is: S _ _ N A

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting S _ _ N A with no excluded letters.

Possible words:

- SPANA – invalid
- SHANA – invalid
- SPINA – invalid
- STANA – invalid
- SWANA – invalid
- SPENA – invalid

Hmm, seems few. Let’s think differently: maybe N isn’t in position 4? But it can’t be in 2 or 3, and 5 is A, so N must be 4. 

But no common word fits S _ _ N A. Maybe we missed something. Let’s re-examine:

From SCRAM: A was ""-"" in position 4, so A cannot be 4, but can be 2,3,5. But from SNAKY: A was ""-"" in 2, so A cannot be 2. From SLATE: A was ""-"" in 3, so A cannot be 3. Therefore A must be 5. So pattern is S _ _ _ A.

N must be in position 4 (since it can’t be 2 or 3, and 5 is A).

So pattern: S _ _ N A.

Real words fitting this:
- SQUANA – invalid

Wait, ""SPANA"" isn’t valid. ""SQUANA"" isn’t a word. ""SHANA"" isn’t valid.

Wait, let me check ""SQUANA"" – actually it’s a valid place name but not a common word. 

Given constraints, ""SQUANA"" seems closest, but let me think of others.

Another approach: maybe N is in position 2? But from SNAKY, N was ""-"" in position 2, meaning N is in word but not in 2. So N must be 3 or 4. From SCRAM, A was ""-"" in 4, so A can’t be 4 (but must be 5). So N must be 3 or 4. 

But A must be 5, so pattern: S _ N _ A or S _ _ N A.

Real words:
- SQUANA – fits S _ _ N A
- SPANA – invalid
- SHANA – invalid
- SPHNA – invalid
- SQUANA – valid (though rare)

""SQUANA"" is actually a valid word (a small river in Pennsylvania), so let’s use it.

But let me check if there’s a more common word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, T, L, N, S, etc. 

Some popular first guesses are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O - very vowel-heavy)

Among these, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's widely considered one of the best starting words due to its mix of common consonants and vowels, and its ability to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in the first position (✓).
- L is not in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).
- T is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

So we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains A, but not in position 3.
- Does not contain L, T, E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep S in position 1.
2. Try A in a different position (positions 2, 4, or 5).
3. Avoid L, T, E.
4. Introduce new common consonants to test.

Good candidates:
- SNAKY (S✓, A in 2nd, tests N, K, Y)
- SPANK (S✓, A in 3rd - but A was in 3rd and marked wrong position, so avoid)
- SHARK (S✓, A in 3rd - same issue)
- SWARM (S✓, A in 3rd - same issue)
- SCARF (S✓, A in 3rd - same issue)
- SCAMP (S✓, A in 3rd - same issue)
- SADLY (S✓, A in 2nd, tests D, L, Y - but L is excluded)
- SAGGY (S✓, A in 2nd, tests G, G, Y)

Best choice seems SNAKY as it tests new consonants N, K, Y and places A in position 2.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word is S _ _ _ _ (S is locked in position 1).
2. A is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (because it was marked ""-"" in both places).
3. N is in the word but NOT in position 2.
4. Letters definitely absent: L, T, E, K, Y.

So the remaining positions (2-5) must contain:
- A (but only in positions 3, 4, or 5, but position 3 was already ""-"" so A must be in 4 or 5)
- N (but not in position 2)
- No other letters from the excluded set.

Good consonants to test next: R, D, G, B, C, M, P, V, W, etc.

Let’s try to place A in position 4 and N in position 3 (since N can’t be in 2 and A can’t be in 2 or 3):

We need two more consonants for positions 2 and 5. Common choices that haven’t been ruled out: R, D, G, B, C, M, P, V, W.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, R, T, L, N, S, etc. 

Some popular first guesses are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O - very vowel-heavy)

Among these, I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's widely considered one of the best starting words due to its mix of common consonants and vowels, and its ability to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in the first position (✓).
- L is not in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (-).
- T is not in the word (x).
- E is not in the word (x).

So we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains A, but not in position 3.
- Does not contain L, T, E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep S in position 1.
2. Try A in a different position (positions 2, 4, or 5).
3. Avoid L, T, E.
4. Introduce new common consonants to test.

Good candidates:
- SNAKY (S✓, A in 2nd, tests N, K, Y)
- SPANK (S✓, A in 3rd - but A was in 3rd and marked wrong position, so avoid)
- SHARK (S✓, A in 3rd - same issue)
- SWARM (S✓, A in 3rd - same issue)
- SCARF (S✓, A in 3rd - same issue)
- SCAMP (S✓, A in 3rd - same issue)
- SADLY (S✓, A in 2nd, tests D, L, Y - but L is excluded)
- SAGGY (S✓, A in 2nd, tests G, G, Y)

Best choice seems SNAKY as it tests new consonants N, K, Y and places A in position 2.

Guess 2: SNAKY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(-) A(-) K(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word is S _ _ _ _ (S is locked in position 1).
2. A is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (because it was marked ""-"" in both places).
3. N is in the word but NOT in position 2.
4. Letters definitely absent: L, T, E, K, Y.

So the remaining positions (2-5) must contain:
- A (but only in positions 3, 4, or 5, but position 3 was already ""-"" so A must be in 4 or 5)
- N (but not in position 2)
- No other letters from the excluded set.

Good consonants to test next: R, D, G, B, C, M, P, V, W, etc.

Let’s try to place A in position 4 and N in position 3 (since N can’t be in 2 and A can’t be in 2 or 3):
S _ N A _

We need two more consonants for positions 2 and 5. Common choices that haven’t been ruled out: R, D, G, B, C, M, P, V, W.

A balanced word: SCRAM – but M is untested and fits. However, A would be in position 4 and N in 3, satisfying the constraints.

Check: S C N A M – but N is in position 3 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed), no excluded letters.

Another option: S B N A R – but ""SNBAR"" isn’t a valid word.

""SCRAM"" is valid and fits all constraints.

Let’s go with SCRAM.

Guess 3: SCRAM -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) R(x) A(-) M(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

1. S is locked in position 1.
2. A is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (it was ""-"" in positions 2, 3, and 4).  
   Therefore A must be in position 5.
3. N is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from SNAKY and SCRAM).  
   So N must be in position 4 (since position 5 is now locked as A).
4. Letters definitely absent: L, T, E, K, Y, C, R, M.
5. Remaining consonants to test: B, D, F, G, H, J, P, V, W, X, Z (but we need common ones).

So the pattern is: S _ _ N A

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting S _ _ N A with no excluded letters.

Possible words:
- SPANA – invalid (not a common word)
- SWANA – invalid
- SHANA – invalid
- SPINA – invalid
- STANA – invalid (T excluded)
- SNANA – invalid
- SPHNA – invalid
- SPENA – invalid
- SPGNA – invalid
- SPBNA – invalid

Wait, let’s list real words ending in N A:
- SNAKA – invalid (K excluded)
- SNAVA – invalid
- SPANA – invalid
- SHANA – invalid
- SPINA – invalid
- STANA – invalid
- SWANA – invalid
- SPENA – invalid
- SPHNA – invalid

Hmm, seems few. Let’s think differently: maybe N isn’t in position 4? But it can’t be in 2 or 3, and 5 is A, so N must be 4. 

But no common word fits S _ _ N A. Maybe we missed something. Let’s re-examine:

From SCRAM: A was ""-"" in position 4, so A cannot be 4, but can be 2,3,5. But from SNAKY: A was ""-"" in 2, so A cannot be 2. From SLATE: A was ""-"" in 3, so A cannot be 3. Therefore A must be 5. So pattern is S _ _ _ A.

N must be in position 4 (since it can’t be 2 or 3, and 5 is A).

So pattern: S _ _ N A.

Real words fitting this:
- SQUANA – invalid
- SPHANA – invalid
- SHANA – invalid
- SPANA – invalid
- STANA – invalid
- SWANA – invalid
- SPENA – invalid

Wait, ""SPANA"" isn’t valid. ""SQUANA"" isn’t a word. ""SHANA"" isn’t valid. 

This suggests we need to test new consonants in positions 2 and 3. Let’s try:

S B O N A – invalid
S D O N A – invalid
S G O N A – invalid
S P O N A – invalid
S V O N A – invalid

""SPOON"" – but A is required at 5, not matching.

Wait, let’s try:

S P A N A – but A is already at 5, and A can’t be 2,3,4.

This is tricky. Let me think of valid 5-letter words starting with S, ending with A, containing N, avoiding excluded letters.

Valid words:
- SNAKA – invalid (K excluded)
- SPANA – invalid
- SPINA – invalid
- STANA – invalid
- SWANA – invalid
- SQUANA – invalid
- SHANA – invalid
- SPOONA – invalid
- SPOON – 4 letters
- SNAFU – invalid
- SNAKY – already guessed

It appears the only plausible word is ""SQUANA"" but it’s not valid. 

Wait, let me check ""SQUANA"" – actually it’s a valid place name but not a common word. 

Given constraints, ""SQUANA"" seems closest, but let me think of others.

Another approach: maybe N is in position 2? But from SNAKY, N was ""-"" in position 2, meaning N is in word but not in 2. So N must be 3 or 4. From SCRAM, A was ""-"" in 4, so A can’t be 4 (but must be 5). So N must be 3 or 4. 

But A must be 5, so pattern: S _ N _ A or S _ _ N A.

Real words:
- SQUANA – fits S _ _ N A
- SPANA – invalid
- SHANA – invalid
- SPHNA – invalid
- SQUANA – valid (though rare)

""SQUANA"" is actually a valid word (a small river in Pennsylvania), so let’s use it.

But let me check if there’s a more common word. 

Another word: ""SPOON"" – but 4 letters and ends with N, not A.

""SQUANA"" seems to be the only valid 5-letter word fitting constraints. 

Therefore, next guess: SQUANA.The constraints now pin the word to the pattern S _ _ N A, with N in position 4 and A in position 5. The only valid English word fitting this pattern is:

Known facts:
1. First letter is S (✓ every time).
2. A is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (it was ""-"" in those spots).  
   Therefore A must be in position 5.
3. N is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (it was ""-"" there).  
   Therefore N must be in position 4.
4. Letters already ruled out: L, T, E, K, Y, C, R, M, SQUANA (invalid 5-letter word).

Upon closer inspection, the only valid 5-letter word that matches the pattern S _ _ N A is:

S P A N A – but this is not an English word.

This contradiction implies we must have missed an earlier candidate.
