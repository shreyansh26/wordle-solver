From the feedback on AROSE:

- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

I’ll try a word with A in position 2 and use other common letters: “TAINT” uses T, A, I, N, T – but repeats T.  
“PAINT” uses P, A, I, N, T – all distinct and common.  
“PAINT” seems like a strong second guess.

Let’s update what we know from both guesses.

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. PAINT → P(x) A(-) I(-) N(x) T(-)
   - P is not in the word.
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - N is not in the word.
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Must contain: A, I, T (each in positions different from their previous ones)
- Must NOT contain: R, O, S, E, P, N

Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in 1 or 2
- I cannot be in 3
- T cannot be in 5

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: L, U, D, M, Y, C, G, H, K, B, F, W, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, I, T plus two new letters, with the positional constraints above.

Possible positions:
A can be 3, 4, or 5
I can be 1, 2, 4, or 5
T can be 1, 2, 3, or 4

Let’s try to place them:
- Put A in 3: _ _ A _ _
- Put I in 2: _ I A _ _
- Put T in 1: T I A _ _

We need two more letters that are not forbidden. Let’s pick common ones like L and U.

Word formed: T I A L U → “TIALU” – not a valid English word.

Try swapping: T I A L _ → “TIAL_” – no valid word.

Try A in 4: _ _ _ A _
I in 2: _ _ I A _
T in 1: T _ I A _

Need a letter for position 2. Common unused: L, U, D, M, Y, C, G, H, K, B, F, W, V.

Try T H I A L – “THIAL” – invalid.

Try T I A _ _ with A in 4: _ _ _ A I
But I can’t be in 5 because T cannot be in 5, but I could be in 5. Wait, constraints:
- I cannot be in 3 (already)
- No other restriction on I’s position except that.

Let me try a different approach: list valid words containing A, I, T without forbidden letters.

Valid English words with A, I, T and no R,O,S,E,P,N.

Examples:
- “VITAL” – contains V, I, T, A, L. Check constraints:
  - A is in 4 (allowed, since A cannot be 1 or 2)
  - I is in 3 (but feedback says I is not in 3 – so invalid)
  
- “TIGAR” – contains T, I, G, A, R – but R is forbidden.

- “TALUK” – not common.

- “TAWKI” – not valid.

- “VITAI” – not a word.

- “TWAIL” – not common.

- “TWAIN” – N is forbidden.

- “TIAHO” – O is forbidden.

- “TIBIA” – I in 3 is forbidden.

- “TIDAL” – contains T, I, D, A, L:
  - A is in 4 (allowed)
  - I is in 2 (allowed, since I cannot be in 3)
  - T is in 1 (allowed, since T cannot be in 5)
  - D and L are new letters, not forbidden.

“TIDAL” is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

Let me verify:
- Letters: T, I, D, A, L – none of R, O, S, E, P, N
- A is in 4 (not 1 or 2) ✓
- I is in 2 (not 3) ✓
- T is in 1 (not 5) ✓
- D and L are new letters ✓

Therefore, “TIDAL” is a good next guess.

I can be 1, 2, 4, or 5
T can be 1, 2, 3, or 4

Let’s try to place them:
- Put A in 3: _ _ A _ _
- Put I in 2: _ I A _ _
- Put T in 1: T I A _ _

We need two more letters that are not forbidden. Let’s pick common ones like L and U.

Word formed: T I A L U → “TIALU” – not a valid English word.

Try swapping: T I A L _ → “TIAL_” – no valid word.

Try A in 4: _ _ _ A _
I in 2: _ _ I A _
T in 1: T _ I A _

Need a letter for position 2. Common unused: L, U, D, M, Y, C, G, H, K, B, F, W, V.

Try T H I A L – “THIAL” – invalid.

Try T I A _ _ with A in 4: _ _ _ A I
But I can’t be in 5 because T cannot be in 5, but I could be in 5. Wait, constraints:
- I cannot be in 3 (already)
- No other restriction on I’s position except that.

Let me try a different approach: list valid words containing A, I, T without forbidden letters.

Valid English words with A, I, T and no R,O,S,E,P,N.

Examples:
- “VITAL” – contains V, I, T, A, L. Check constraints:
  - A is in 4 (allowed, since A cannot be 1 or 2)
  - I is in 3 (but feedback says I is not in 3 – so invalid)
  
- “TIGAR” – contains T, I, G, A, R – but R is forbidden.

- “TALUK” – not common.

- “TAWKI” – not valid.

- “VITAI” – not a word.

- “TWAIL” – not common.

- “TWAIN” – N is forbidden.

- “TIAHO” – O is forbidden.

- “TIBIA” – I in 3 is forbidden.

- “TIDAL” – contains T, I, D, A, L:
  - A is in 4 (allowed)
  - I is in 2 (allowed, since I cannot be in 3)
  - T is in 1 (allowed, since T cannot be in 5)
  - D and L are new letters, not forbidden.

“TIDAL” is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

Let me verify:
- Letters: T, I, D, A, L – none of R, O, S, E, P, N
- A is in 4 (not 1 or 2) ✓
- I is in 2 (not 3) ✓
- T is in 1 (not 5) ✓
- D and L are new letters ✓

Therefore, “TIDAL” is a good next guess.

- D is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- L is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
1. Word starts with TI
2. Must contain A, but A cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4
3. Forbidden letters: R, O, S, E, P, N, D, L
4. Remaining positions 3 and 5 must use letters not yet ruled out and must include A somewhere.

Since A cannot be in 1,2,4, the only positions left for A are 3 or 5.

Let’s consider both cases:

Case 1: A in position 3 → TI A _ _
Case 2: A in position 5 → TI _ _ A

We need a valid 5-letter word starting with TI, having A in 3 or 5, and using only allowed letters.

Looking at common words:
- TI A _ _: “TIA” is a prefix, but common words like TIAL (invalid), TIAR (invalid - R forbidden), etc. don’t exist.
- TI _ _ A: “TIGA” is not a word, “TIKA” not common, but “TIGA” is invalid. However, “TIGA” is invalid because G is allowed, but let’s think of real words.

Real words to check:
- “TIGER” – E and R forbidden.
- “TIGON” – N forbidden.
- “TIKAL” – L forbidden.
- “TILAK” – L and K are allowed? K is allowed, L is forbidden. So invalid.
- “TIPAL” – P and L forbidden.
- “TITAN” – N forbidden.

Wait, let’s think systematically. The word must be TI _ _ A (A in 5) or TI A _ _ (A in 3).

TI A _ _:
- TI A _ _ with allowed letters. Possible letters left: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding forbidden ones).

But common English words: TIAC_? None.

TI _ _ A:
Possible words:
- “TIGA” – not valid.
- “TIKA” – not valid.
- “TIMBA” – M, B allowed? “TIMBA” is a word (a type of drumstick), but let’s check:
  - TIMBA: T I M B A
  - Letters: T, I, M, B, A – none forbidden, A in 5 (allowed), T and I correct in 1-2.
  - Check constraints:
    - A is in 5 (allowed)
    - T and I correct in 1-2
    - No forbidden letters
  - “TIMBA” is valid.

Another option: “TIKMA” – K and M allowed, but “TIKMA” is not a word.

Another: “TIGMA” – G and M allowed, but not a word.

“TIMBA” seems the only valid word fitting the constraints.

Let me verify:
- T I M B A
- T and I correct in positions 1-2 (✓ from feedback)
- A is in position 5 (allowed, since A cannot be 1,2,4) (✓)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is somewhere, but not first).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

I’ll try a word with A in position 2 and use other common letters: “TAINT” uses T, A, I, N, T – but repeats T.

   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - N is not in the word.
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Must contain: A, I, T (each in positions different from their previous ones)
- Must NOT contain: R, O, S, E, P, N

Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in 1 or 2
- I cannot be in 3
- T cannot be in 5

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: L, U, D, M, Y, C, G, H, K, B, F, W, V, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, I, T plus two new letters, with the positional constraints above.

Possible positions:
A can be 3, 4, or 5
I can be 1, 2, 4, or 5
T can be 1, 2, 3, or 4

Let’s try to place them:
- Put A in 3: _ _ A _ _
- Put I in 2: _ I A _ _
- Put T in 1: T I A _ _

We need two more letters that are not forbidden. Let’s pick common ones like L and U.

Try swapping: T I A L _ → “TIAL_” – no valid word.

I in 2: _ _ I A _
T in 1: T _ I A _

From the latest feedback on TIMBA:
- T(✓) – correct in position 1
- I(✓) – correct in position 2
- M(x) – M is not in the word
- B(-) – B is in the word but not in position 4
- A(✓) – correct in position 5

So the word is T I _ _ A, and B must appear somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (since it can’t be in 4, it must be in 3).

Therefore the pattern is: T I B _ A

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits T I B _ A.

Looking at common words:
- TIBIA – but I is already in position 2, and this would have I in position 4, which is allowed, but TIBIA is a valid word.
- TIBER – E is forbidden.
- TIBET – E and T already used, but T is already in position 1.
- TIBMA – M is forbidden.
- TIBRA – R is forbidden.
- TIBLA – L is forbidden.
- TIBCA – not a word.
- TIBDA – not a word.

The only valid word that fits is TIBIA, but let me check:
- T I B I A – but I is already in position 2, and this would have another I in position 4, which is allowed since letters can repeat unless ruled out. However, in our previous feedback, no information about repeated letters has been given, so it’s possible.

But let me think if there’s another word. Another possibility is TIBRA, but R is forbidden. TIBET has E and T already in position 1, so T is already used. 

Actually, the only valid word that fits T I B _ A is TIBIA (though it has I twice), but since no duplicates have been ruled out, this seems possible. However, let me check if there’s a word without repeating I.

Looking again: T I B _ A
- TIBRA – R forbidden
- TIBET – E forbidden
- TIBMA – M forbidden
- TIBLA – L forbidden
- TIBCA – not a word
- TIBDA – not a word
- TIBGA – not a word

It appears TIBIA is the only valid word, even though it repeats I. 

But let me double-check: is there a word like TIBRA? No, R is forbidden. TIBET? E is forbidden. 

Therefore, the only possible word is TIBIA.

However, let me reconsider: the pattern is T I _ _ A, and B must be in position 3 (since it can’t be in 4). So the word must be T I B _ A. The only valid word is TIBIA (though it repeats I). 

But another thought: could it be TIBMA? No, M is forbidden. 

Thus, the only valid word is TIBIA, despite the repeated I. 

But wait, let me check if TIBIA is indeed a valid word. Yes, TIBIA is the singular of tibias, referring to the shin bone, and it is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next guess is TIBIA.
