Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback to work with, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good first guess typically includes common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (lots of vowels)
- AUDIO (vowels A, U, I, O plus D)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and gives good coverage for consonants and vowels.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That means I can safely ignore those letters and focus on the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

A good second guess should:
1. Use entirely new letters.
2. Include some of the most common remaining consonants and vowels.
3. Avoid any of the already-eliminated letters (S, L, A, T, E).

The remaining common letters include: R, N, I, O, U, D, G, H, M, C, Y, etc.

A strong choice is “ROUND”:
- Uses R, O, U, N, D – all new letters.
- Covers three vowels (O, U) and two common consonants (R, N, D).
- Is a valid English word.

Another strong candidate is “CHURN” but “ROUND” is slightly more balanced.

I’ll go with ROUND.

2. ROUND → R(x) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)  
   - R, U, D are completely out.  
   - O and N are in the word but not in their current positions.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D  
- Letters that ARE in the word: O, N (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both O and N.  
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D.  
- Has O not in position 2 and N not in position 4.

Remaining common letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place O and N in new spots while using fresh letters.

A good candidate is “CHINO”:
- C, H, I are new letters.  
- O moves to position 4 (allowed, since it was only forbidden in position 2).  
- N moves to position 5 (allowed, since it was only forbidden in position 4).

No forbidden letters appear, and we test new consonants C, H, I while repositioning O and N.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after the three guesses.

Letters that are **not** in the word (x):
S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D, C, H

Letters that **are** in the word:
- I is in the word and is in position 3 (✓).
- O is in the word but **not** in positions 2 or 4 (from ROUND and CHINO feedback).
- N is in the word but **not** in positions 4 or 5 (from ROUND and CHINO feedback).

So far:
- Position 3 is I.
- O must be in position 1 or 5.
- N must be in position 1, 2, or 3, but position 3 is already I, so N must be in position 1 or 2.

Possible positions:
- If N is in position 1, then O must be in position 5 (since positions 2 and 4 are excluded for O, and 3 is I).
- If N is in position 2, then O must be in position 5 (since position 1 is still open for O, but we want to test it).

Let’s consider the structure:
- N _ I _ _  (N in 1, O in 5) → N I _ _ O
- _ N I _ _  (N in 2, O in 5) → _ N I _ O

We need to fill the remaining blanks with letters that have not been eliminated:
Available letters: B, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try the first structure: N _ I _ O
We need two more letters. Common consonants left: B, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

A good candidate is N B I G O → “NBIGO” – but this is not a valid English word.

Next, N F I T O – but T is eliminated.

N F I G O – “NFIGO” – not valid.

N G I V O – “NGIVO” – not valid.

Let’s try the second structure: _ N I _ O
We need a first letter and a fourth letter. Possible valid words:
- B N I _ O → “B N I _ O” – “BINGO” is valid! Let’s check:
  - B: new letter, allowed.
  - N: allowed in position 2.
  - I: correct in position 3.
  - N: allowed in position 2 (not 4 or 5).
  - O: allowed in position 5 (not 2 or 4).

“BINGO” fits all constraints and is a valid English word.

Therefore, the next guess is BINGO.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback to work with, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good first guess typically includes common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (lots of vowels)
- AUDIO (vowels A, U, I, O plus D)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and gives good coverage for consonants and vowels.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That means I can safely ignore those letters and focus on the remaining 21 letters of the alphabet.

A good second guess should:
1. Use entirely new letters.
2. Include some of the most common remaining consonants and vowels.
3. Avoid any of the already-eliminated letters (S, L, A, T, E).

The remaining common letters include: R, N, I, O, U, D, G, H, M, C, Y, etc.

A strong choice is “ROUND”:
- Uses R, O, U, N, D – all new letters.
- Covers three vowels (O, U) and two common consonants (R, N, D).
- Is a valid English word.

Another strong candidate is “CHURN” but “ROUND” is slightly more balanced.

I’ll go with ROUND.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
   Eliminates S, L, A, T, E entirely.

2. ROUND → R(x) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)  
   - R, U, D are completely out.  
   - O and N are in the word but not in their current positions.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D  
- Letters that ARE in the word: O, N (but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both O and N.  
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D.  
- Has O not in position 2 and N not in position 4.

Remaining common letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place O and N in new spots while using fresh letters.

A good candidate is “CHINO”:
- C, H, I are new letters.  
- O moves to position 4 (allowed, since it was only forbidden in position 2).  
- N moves to position 5 (allowed, since it was only forbidden in position 4).

No forbidden letters appear, and we test new consonants C, H, I while repositioning O and N.

Let’s update the information after the fourth guess.

Letters that are **not** in the word (x):
S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D, C, H, B, G

Letters that **are** in the word:
- I is in the word but **not** in position 2 (from BINGO feedback).
- N is in the word but **not** in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (from ROUND, CHINO, BINGO feedback).
- O is in the word but **not** in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (from ROUND, CHINO, BINGO feedback).

Wait, let’s re-examine the feedback carefully:

ROUND → R(x) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)  
→ O is in word but not in position 2  
→ N is in word but not in position 4  

CHINO → C(x) H(x) I(✓) N(-) O(-)  
→ I is in word and in position 3  
→ N is in word but not in position 4 (already known)  
→ O is in word but not in position 5  

BINGO → B(x) I(-) N(-) G(x) O(-)  
→ I is in word but not in position 2  
→ N is in word but not in position 3  
→ O is in word but not in position 5  

So combining all constraints:

- I must be in position 3 (from CHINO’s I(✓)).
- O must be in position 1 (only remaining spot not yet excluded: positions 2,4,5 have been excluded).
- N must be in position 1 or 2 (positions 3,4,5 excluded), but position 1 is now taken by O, so N must be in position 2.

Thus the word must be:  
O N I _ _

We need one more letter for position 4.  
Available letters (not yet eliminated): F, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting the pattern O N I _ _:

ONION – but O is already in position 1 and N in 2, but the third is I, so ONION would have O N I O N – but we already have O in 1 and N in 2, and the word is 5 letters. However, ONION is a valid word, but we need to check if O and N are allowed in positions 4 and 5. From previous feedback, O is allowed in position 1 (we know it's not in 2,3,4,5 from BINGO, but actually BINGO only excluded O from 2,5, not 4. Wait, let's re-examine:

From ROUND: O not in 2  
From CHINO: O not in 5  
From BINGO: O not in 5 (again)  
So O is allowed in 1,3,4. But position 3 is I, so O must be in 1 or 4.

Similarly, N is allowed in 1,2 (positions 3,4,5 excluded). But position 1 could be O or N.

Let's re-examine the exact exclusions:

O exclusions: 2,5  
N exclusions: 4,3,2 (from ROUND, CHINO, BINGO)  
So N can be in 1 or 5, but 5 is allowed for N? Wait:

ROUND: N not in 4  
CHINO: N not in 4 (same)  
BINGO: N not in 3  
So N is excluded from 3,4. Thus N can be in 1,2,5.

But position 3 is I (from CHINO), so N can be in 1,2,5.

O exclusions: 2,5  
So O can be in 1,3,4. But 3 is I, so O can be in 1 or 4.

Thus possible patterns:

Case 1: O in 1, N in 2,5  
   O N I _ _  (positions 4,5 to fill)  
   or  
   O _ I N _  

Case 2: O in 4, N in 1,2,5  
   _ N I _ O  (positions 1,4,5 to fill)  
   or  
   N _ I _ O  
   or  
   _ _ I _ O  

Let's look for valid words:

Case 1: O N I _ _  
   ONI__ – possible words: ONION (but O N I O N – positions: O(1), N(2), I(3), O(4), N(5). But O is allowed in 4? Yes, exclusions for O are 2,5, so 4 is allowed. N is allowed in 2 (exclusions for N are 3,4). So ONION would fit, but is ONION valid? Yes.

Case 2: _ N I _ O  
   Need a letter for position 1 and 4. Available: F, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

Possible words:  
FN... no  
KN... KNI_O – KNIFE? But E is eliminated.  
MN... MN... M N I _ O – MN... no common word.  
PN... P N I _ O – P N I _ O – ""PINO"" but needs 5 letters.  
VN... V N I _ O – no  
WN... W N I _ O – no  
YN... Y N I _ O – no  

Case 3: N _ I _ O  
   N _ I _ O – positions 2,4 to fill.  
   N F I _ O – N F I _ O – ""NIFIO"" – no.  
   N K I _ O – ""N K I _ O"" – no.  
   N M I _ O – ""N M I _ O"" – no.  
   N P I _ O – ""N P I _ O"" – no.  
   N V I _ O – ""N V I _ O"" – no.  
   N W I _ O – ""N W I _ O"" – no.  
   N Y I _ O – ""N Y I _ O"" – no.  

Case 4: _ _ I _ O  
   Need N in 1,2,5.  
   _ N I _ O – already considered.  
   N _ I _ O – already considered.  

Thus the only valid word seems to be ONION, but let's check:

ONION: O(1), N(2), I(3), O(4), N(5).  
- O is allowed in 1 and 4 (exclusions for O: 2,5)  
- N is allowed in 2 and 5 (exclusions for N: 3,4)  
- I is in 3 (correct)  
- All letters are allowed (no eliminated letters).  

ONION fits all constraints.
</think>

The only valid 5-letter word that fits all the constraints is ONION.

<guess>ONION</guess>",ONION,"Let’s update the information after the fourth guess.

Letters that are **not** in the word (x):
S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D, C, H, B, G

Letters that **are** in the word:
- I is in the word but **not** in position 2 (from BINGO feedback).
- N is in the word but **not** in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (from ROUND, CHINO, BINGO feedback).
- O is in the word but **not** in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (from ROUND, CHINO, BINGO feedback).

Wait, let’s re-examine the feedback carefully:

ROUND → R(x) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)  
→ O is in word but not in position 2  
→ N is in word but not in position 4  

CHINO → C(x) H(x) I(✓) N(-) O(-)  
→ I is in word and in position 3  
→ N is in word but not in position 4 (already known)  
→ O is in word but not in position 5  

BINGO → B(x) I(-) N(-) G(x) O(-)  
→ I is in word but not in position 2  
→ N is in word but not in position 3  
→ O is in word but not in position 5  

So combining all constraints:

- I must be in position 3 (from CHINO’s I(✓)).
- O must be in position 1 (only remaining spot not yet excluded: positions 2,4,5 have been excluded).
- N must be in position 1 or 2 (positions 3,4,5 excluded), but position 1 is now taken by O, so N must be in position 2.

Thus the word must be:  
O N I _ _

We need one more letter for position 4.  
Available letters (not yet eliminated): F, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting the pattern O N I _ _:

ONION – but O is already in position 1 and N in 2, but the third is I, so ONION would have O N I O N – but we already have O in 1 and N in 2, and the word is 5 letters. However, ONION is a valid word, but we need to check if O and N are allowed in positions 4 and 5. From previous feedback, O is allowed in position 1 (we know it's not in 2,3,4,5 from BINGO, but actually BINGO only excluded O from 2,5, not 4. Wait, let's re-examine:

From ROUND: O not in 2  
From CHINO: O not in 5  
From BINGO: O not in 5 (again)  
So O is allowed in 1,3,4. But position 3 is I, so O must be in 1 or 4.

Similarly, N is allowed in 1,2 (positions 3,4,5 excluded). But position 1 could be O or N.

Let's re-examine the exact exclusions:

O exclusions: 2,5  
N exclusions: 4,3,2 (from ROUND, CHINO, BINGO)  
So N can be in 1 or 5, but 5 is allowed for N? Wait:

ROUND: N not in 4  
CHINO: N not in 4 (same)  
BINGO: N not in 3  
So N is excluded from 3,4. Thus N can be in 1,2,5.

But position 3 is I (from CHINO), so N can be in 1,2,5.

O exclusions: 2,5  
So O can be in 1,3,4. But 3 is I, so O can be in 1 or 4.

Thus possible patterns:

Case 1: O in 1, N in 2,5  
   O N I _ _  (positions 4,5 to fill)  
   or  
   O _ I N _  

Case 2: O in 4, N in 1,2,5  
   _ N I _ O  (positions 1,4,5 to fill)  
   or  
   N _ I _ O  
   or  
   _ _ I _ O  

Let's look for valid words:

Case 1: O N I _ _  
   ONI__ – possible words: ONION (but O N I O N – positions: O(1), N(2), I(3), O(4), N(5). But O is allowed in 4? Yes, exclusions for O are 2,5, so 4 is allowed. N is allowed in 2 (exclusions for N are 3,4). So ONION would fit, but is ONION valid? Yes.

Case 2: _ N I _ O  
   Need a letter for position 1 and 4. Available: F, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

Possible words:  
FN... no  
KN... KNI_O – KNIFE? But E is eliminated.  
MN... MN... M N I _ O – MN... no common word.  
PN... P N I _ O – P N I _ O – ""PINO"" but needs 5 letters.  
VN... V N I _ O – no  
WN... W N I _ O – no  
YN... Y N I _ O – no  

Case 3: N _ I _ O  
   N _ I _ O – positions 2,4 to fill.  
   N F I _ O – N F I _ O – ""NIFIO"" – no.  
   N K I _ O – ""N K I _ O"" – no.  
   N M I _ O – ""N M I _ O"" – no.  
   N P I _ O – ""N P I _ O"" – no.  
   N V I _ O – ""N V I _ O"" – no.  
   N W I _ O – ""N W I _ O"" – no.  
   N Y I _ O – ""N Y I _ O"" – no.  

Case 4: _ _ I _ O  
   Need N in 1,2,5.  
   _ N I _ O – already considered.  
   N _ I _ O – already considered.  

Thus the only valid word seems to be ONION, but let's check:

ONION: O(1), N(2), I(3), O(4), N(5).  
- O is allowed in 1 and 4 (exclusions for O: 2,5)  
- N is allowed in 2 and 5 (exclusions for N: 3,4)  
- I is in 3 (correct)  
- All letters are allowed (no eliminated letters).  

ONION fits all constraints.The only valid 5-letter word that fits all the constraints is ONION.",Guess 5: ONION -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) N(✓) I(✓) O(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
