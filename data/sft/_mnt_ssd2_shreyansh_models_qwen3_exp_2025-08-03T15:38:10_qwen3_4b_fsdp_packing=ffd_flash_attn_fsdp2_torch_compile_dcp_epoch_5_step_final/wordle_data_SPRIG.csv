### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc. 

A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because:
- It contains the vowels A and E
- It has common consonants S, L, T
- These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words

This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word early on, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback:
- S is in the word and in the correct first position.
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the word starts with S and must avoid L, A, T, E.  
We need 4 more letters that are not L, A, T, E.  
Good consonants to try next are R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, etc.  
Good vowels to try next are I, O, U (since A and E are ruled out).

A strong second guess would use new common letters.  
“SHORN” is a good choice because:
- Starts with S ✓
- Uses H, O, R, N — none of which are ruled out
- Contains two vowels (O) and three new consonants (H, R, N)

Consonants: D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: I, Y (only two left; A, E, O, U are out)

We need two more consonants or the vowel I/Y to fill positions 2 and 5.

Good candidates that fit S _ R _ _ and use only allowed letters:
- S I R I N  – but N is ruled out.  
- S I R V E  – E ruled out.  
- S I R V Y  – uses I and Y, no banned letters.  
- S I R K Y  – K and Y allowed.  
- S I R V Y vs S I R K Y: both valid, but “SIRKY” isn’t a common word.  
- “SIDRY” – D and Y allowed, but “SIDRY” is obscure.  
- “SPRIG” – P, I, G allowed, and G is still available.  
- “SPIKY” – P, I, K, Y allowed.

Among these, “SPIKY” is a common word and uses P, I, K, Y – all still allowed.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc. 

A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because:
- It contains the vowels A and E
- It has common consonants S, L, T
- These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words

This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word early on, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- S is in the word and in the correct first position.
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the word starts with S and must avoid L, A, T, E.  
We need 4 more letters that are not L, A, T, E.  
Good consonants to try next are R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, etc.  
Good vowels to try next are I, O, U (since A and E are ruled out).

A strong second guess would use new common letters.  
“SHORN” is a good choice because:
- Starts with S ✓
- Uses H, O, R, N — none of which are ruled out
- Contains two vowels (O) and three new consonants (H, R, N)

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word starts with S (first letter confirmed ✓).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: L, A, T, E, H, O, N.
3. The letter R is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (R received “-” feedback).

So far the pattern is:  
S _ _ _ _

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):  
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: I, U, Y (since A, E, O are ruled out)

R must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Starts with S  
- Contains R in one of the remaining three slots  
- Uses only allowed letters  
- Introduces new common consonants and the remaining vowel I/U

A good candidate is “SURGE” but E is already ruled out.  
Next candidate: “SPIRE” – E ruled out.  
“SCRUB” – uses C, R, U, B; none ruled out, and R appears in position 3.  
“SCRUB” fits all constraints.

Let’s go with SCRUB.

Current confirmed facts:
1. Word pattern: S P _ _ _  (positions 1 and 2 are S and P)
2. Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, O, N, C, U, B, K, Y
3. Letter I is in the word but NOT in position 3.

So the pattern is:
S P _ _ _
with I somewhere in positions 4 or 5.

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):
Consonants: D, F, G, J, M, Q, R, V, W, X, Z
Vowels: I (only vowel left)

We need two more letters from the allowed list, with I in either position 4 or 5.

Possible combinations:
- S P _ I _ : third letter must be a consonant from allowed list, fifth letter must be a consonant from allowed list.
- S P _ _ I : third and fourth letters must be consonants from allowed list.

Let's list possible words:
For S P _ I _:
- SPRI_ : but R is already confirmed in position 3 (from SCRUB feedback), so this would conflict. Wait, no - SCRUB showed R in position 3, but that was in the context of SCRUB, not SPIKY. Actually, from SCRUB we only know R is in the word (position 3 in SCRUB, but that doesn't translate directly to position in the actual word - wait no, SCRUB feedback was S(✓) C(x) R(✓) U(x) B(x), meaning R is in the word and in position 3. So R is definitely in position 3.

Therefore the pattern is:
S P R _ _

But from SPIKY feedback: S(✓) P(✓) I(-) K(x) Y(x), meaning I is in the word but not in position 3 (which is already R), so I must be in position 4 or 5.

So pattern:
S P R _ _
with I in position 4 or 5.

Possible words:
- S P R I _ : needs one more letter from allowed consonants (D, F, G, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Z)
- S P R _ I : needs one more letter from allowed consonants (D, F, G, J, M, Q, V, W, X, Z)

Looking at common words:
- SPRIG - but G is allowed, and this is a common word.
- SPRIM - not a common word.
- SPRID - not a common word.
- SPRIV - not a common word.
- SPRUX - not a common word.

The most plausible common word is SPRIG.
