For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but ""AROSE"" has slightly better letter frequency coverage. After considering options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so it must appear in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- A, R, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like: _ _ O _ _ with an E somewhere except position 5.

Good consonants to test next are T, N, L, C, D, etc. Since E must appear, we can try placing it in position 1, 2, or 4.

A strong next guess is ""TOE"" plus two more consonants. ""TOE"" is a good starter because T is common, O is confirmed in position 3, and E is confirmed present. But we need 5 letters. 

Let's try ""TOWER"" but that has R which we know is out. Instead, ""TOILE"" uses T, I, O, L, E. But I is untested. 

Better: ""TONER"" has R which is out. ""TOWER"" has R. 

Alternative: ""OCEAN"" but A is out. 

Better approach: keep O in position 3, place E in position 2, and test common consonants in 1,4,5. 

Guess: ""B E O N D"" but that's not a word. 

How about ""BEOW_"" but W is untested. 

Actually, simpler: ""BEOW_"" is not valid. 

Let's try ""BEAST"" but S is out. 

""BEACH"" has A out. 

""BELOW"" has L, O, W. But O is correct position. 

Wait, we need O in position 3. So structure is _ _ O _ _. 

Let's try ""C"" in position 1, ""H"" in 2, ""O"" in 3, ""D"" in 4, ""E"" in 5: ""CHODE"" but that's not a common word. 

Better: ""COBIE"" but B is untested. 

""COVEY"" but Y is untested. 

""DOPEY"" has Y and D, O, P, E. 

But P is untested. 

""DOPEY"" seems valid but let's check: D(1), O(3), P(4), E(5), Y(2). But E was in position 5 in AROSE and feedback said E is in word but wrong position, so E cannot be in 5. So ""DOPEY"" is invalid because E would be in 5. 

We need E in 1,2, or 4. 

Let's try ""PEONY"" but P is untested and N is untested. 

""PEONY"" has P, E, O, N, Y. O is in position 3, E is in position 2. This seems good. 

But ""PEONY"" is a valid word (a type of flower). 

Another option: ""TONER"" but R is out. 

""TONIC"" but I is untested. 

""TONIC"" has T, O, N, I, C. O is in position 3, E must be present but this guess doesn't have E. 

We must include E. 

So structure: _ _ O _ _, with E in 1,2, or 4. 

Let's try ""E"" in position 1: E _ O _ _. Common consonants: ""E"" + ""L"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""D"" -> ""E L O N D"" not a word. 

""E"" + ""A"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""T"" but A is out. 

""E"" + ""D"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""T"" -> ""EDONT"" not a word. 

""E"" + ""M"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""T"" -> ""EMONT"" not a word. 

""E"" + ""T"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""D"" -> ""ETOND"" not a word. 

""E"" in position 2: _ E O _ _. 

Possible: ""B"" + ""E"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""D"" -> ""B E O N D"" not a word. 

""C"" + ""E"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""T"" -> ""C E O N T"" not a word. 

""D"" + ""E"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""T"" -> ""D E O N T"" not a word. 

""E"" in position 4: _ _ O E _. 

Possible: ""C"" + ""O"" + ""B"" + ""E"" + ""D"" -> ""COBED"" not a word. 

""B"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""E"" + ""D"" -> ""BONED"" which is valid. 

""BONED"" has B, O, N, E, D. O is in position 3 (correct), E is in position 4 (allowed since it was in position 5 before, now position 4 is new). 

This seems like a good next guess. 

Let's confirm: B, O, N, E, D - all letters are allowed (A, R, S are out, others are in). 

""BONED"" is a valid English word meaning ""broken"" or ""fractured"". 

So the next guess is BONED.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- O is correctly in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- A, R, S are not in the word at all.

I'll try a word that keeps O in position 3, places E in a new position (not 5), and tests common consonants.

   - A, R, S are **not** in the word.

   - O is marked “-” (in the word but **wrong position**).  
   - N and E are also marked “-” (in the word but **wrong position**).

But wait: the first feedback already told us O is in the **correct position 3**, so the “-” for O in BONED is **redundant** and confirms our prior conclusion.  
The new information is that **N** and **E** are in the word but **not in positions 3 and 5** respectively.

So the secret word has:
- O fixed in position 3.  
- E somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since it can’t be 5).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but ""AROSE"" has slightly better letter frequency coverage. After considering options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so it must appear in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- A, R, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like: _ _ O _ _ with an E somewhere except position 5.

Good consonants to test next are T, N, L, C, D, etc. Since E must appear, we can try placing it in position 1, 2, or 4.

A strong next guess is ""TOE"" plus two more consonants. ""TOE"" is a good starter because T is common, O is confirmed in position 3, and E is confirmed present. But we need 5 letters. 

Let's try ""TOWER"" but that has R which we know is out. Instead, ""TOILE"" uses T, I, O, L, E. But I is untested. 

Better: ""TONER"" has R which is out. ""TOWER"" has R. 

Alternative: ""OCEAN"" but A is out. 

Better approach: keep O in position 3, place E in position 2, and test common consonants in 1,4,5. 

Guess: ""B E O N D"" but that's not a word. 

How about ""BEOW_"" but W is untested. 

Actually, simpler: ""BEOW_"" is not valid. 

Let's try ""BEAST"" but S is out. 

""BEACH"" has A out. 

""BELOW"" has L, O, W. But O is correct position. 

Wait, we need O in position 3. So structure is _ _ O _ _. 

Let's try ""C"" in position 1, ""H"" in 2, ""O"" in 3, ""D"" in 4, ""E"" in 5: ""CHODE"" but that's not a common word. 

Better: ""COBIE"" but B is untested. 

""COVEY"" but Y is untested. 

""DOPEY"" has Y and D, O, P, E. 

But P is untested. 

""DOPEY"" seems valid but let's check: D(1), O(3), P(4), E(5), Y(2). But E was in position 5 in AROSE and feedback said E is in word but wrong position, so E cannot be in 5. So ""DOPEY"" is invalid because E would be in 5. 

We need E in 1,2, or 4. 

Let's try ""PEONY"" but P is untested and N is untested. 

""PEONY"" has P, E, O, N, Y. O is in position 3, E is in position 2. This seems good. 

But ""PEONY"" is a valid word (a type of flower). 

Another option: ""TONER"" but R is out. 

""TONIC"" but I is untested. 

""TONIC"" has T, O, N, I, C. O is in position 3, E must be present but this guess doesn't have E. 

We must include E. 

So structure: _ _ O _ _, with E in 1,2, or 4. 

Let's try ""E"" in position 1: E _ O _ _. Common consonants: ""E"" + ""L"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""D"" -> ""E L O N D"" not a word. 

""E"" + ""A"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""T"" but A is out. 

""E"" + ""D"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""T"" -> ""EDONT"" not a word. 

""E"" + ""M"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""T"" -> ""EMONT"" not a word. 

""E"" + ""T"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""D"" -> ""ETOND"" not a word. 

""E"" in position 2: _ E O _ _. 

Possible: ""B"" + ""E"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""D"" -> ""B E O N D"" not a word. 

""C"" + ""E"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""T"" -> ""C E O N T"" not a word. 

""D"" + ""E"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""T"" -> ""D E O N T"" not a word. 

""E"" in position 4: _ _ O E _. 

Possible: ""C"" + ""O"" + ""B"" + ""E"" + ""D"" -> ""COBED"" not a word. 

""B"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""E"" + ""D"" -> ""BONED"" which is valid. 

""BONED"" has B, O, N, E, D. O is in position 3 (correct), E is in position 4 (allowed since it was in position 5 before, now position 4 is new). 

This seems like a good next guess. 

Let's confirm: B, O, N, E, D - all letters are allowed (A, R, S are out, others are in). 

""BONED"" is a valid English word meaning ""broken"" or ""fractured"". 

So the next guess is BONED.Based on the feedback:
- O is correctly in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- A, R, S are not in the word at all.

I'll try a word that keeps O in position 3, places E in a new position (not 5), and tests common consonants.

Let’s summarize everything we now know:

Letters ruled out (never appear in the word):

Letters that ARE in the word (but we still don’t know their exact positions):  
O, N, E

Exact constraints:
- O must be in position 3 (from the very first feedback AROSE).  
- E must appear somewhere but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (from AROSE and CONEY).  
- N must appear somewhere but NOT in position 2 (from CONEY).

So the pattern is:  
_ _ O _ _  
with E and N somewhere among the remaining three slots (positions 1, 2, 4), obeying the positional bans above.

Possible placements:
- E can be in 1, 2, or 4.  
- N can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is already O), so 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s list the remaining legal letters:  
Consonants still allowed: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, X, Z  
Vowels still allowed: I, U (O and E already placed)

We need a 5-letter word that:

- Contains both E and N somewhere legal.  
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.

Candidate construction:

- Position 3: O (fixed)  
- Position 4: any allowed letter (could be E or N)

Let’s try to place E in position 1 and N in position 5:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but ""AROSE"" has slightly better letter frequency coverage. After considering options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so it must appear in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- A, R, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like: _ _ O _ _ with an E somewhere except position 5.

Good consonants to test next are T, N, L, C, D, etc. Since E must appear, we can try placing it in position 1, 2, or 4.

A strong next guess is ""TOE"" plus two more consonants. ""TOE"" is a good starter because T is common, O is confirmed in position 3, and E is confirmed present. But we need 5 letters. 

Let's try ""TOWER"" but that has R which we know is out. Instead, ""TOILE"" uses T, I, O, L, E. But I is untested. 

Better: ""TONER"" has R which is out. ""TOWER"" has R. 

Alternative: ""OCEAN"" but A is out. 

Better approach: keep O in position 3, place E in position 2, and test common consonants in 1,4,5. 

Guess: ""B E O N D"" but that's not a word. 

How about ""BEOW_"" but W is untested. 

Actually, simpler: ""BEOW_"" is not valid. 

Let's try ""BEAST"" but S is out. 

""BEACH"" has A out. 

""BELOW"" has L, O, W. But O is correct position. 

Wait, we need O in position 3. So structure is _ _ O _ _. 

Let's try ""C"" in position 1, ""H"" in 2, ""O"" in 3, ""D"" in 4, ""E"" in 5: ""CHODE"" but that's not a common word. 

Better: ""COBIE"" but B is untested. 

""COVEY"" but Y is untested. 

""DOPEY"" has Y and D, O, P, E. 

But P is untested. 

""DOPEY"" seems valid but let's check: D(1), O(3), P(4), E(5), Y(2). But E was in position 5 in AROSE and feedback said E is in word but wrong position, so E cannot be in 5. So ""DOPEY"" is invalid because E would be in 5. 

We need E in 1,2, or 4. 

Let's try ""PEONY"" but P is untested and N is untested. 

""PEONY"" has P, E, O, N, Y. O is in position 3, E is in position 2. This seems good. 

But ""PEONY"" is a valid word (a type of flower). 

Another option: ""TONER"" but R is out. 

""TONIC"" but I is untested. 

""TONIC"" has T, O, N, I, C. O is in position 3, E must be present but this guess doesn't have E. 

We must include E. 

So structure: _ _ O _ _, with E in 1,2, or 4. 

Let's try ""E"" in position 1: E _ O _ _. Common consonants: ""E"" + ""L"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""D"" -> ""E L O N D"" not a word. 

""E"" + ""A"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""T"" but A is out. 

""E"" + ""D"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""T"" -> ""EDONT"" not a word. 

""E"" + ""M"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""T"" -> ""EMONT"" not a word. 

""E"" + ""T"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""D"" -> ""ETOND"" not a word. 

""E"" in position 2: _ E O _ _. 

Possible: ""B"" + ""E"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""D"" -> ""B E O N D"" not a word. 

""C"" + ""E"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""T"" -> ""C E O N T"" not a word. 

""D"" + ""E"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""T"" -> ""D E O N T"" not a word. 

""E"" in position 4: _ _ O E _. 

Possible: ""C"" + ""O"" + ""B"" + ""E"" + ""D"" -> ""COBED"" not a word. 

""B"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""E"" + ""D"" -> ""BONED"" which is valid. 

""BONED"" has B, O, N, E, D. O is in position 3 (correct), E is in position 4 (allowed since it was in position 5 before, now position 4 is new). 

This seems like a good next guess. 

Let's confirm: B, O, N, E, D - all letters are allowed (A, R, S are out, others are in). 

""BONED"" is a valid English word meaning ""broken"" or ""fractured"". 

So the next guess is BONED.Based on the feedback:
- O is correctly in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- A, R, S are not in the word at all.

I'll try a word that keeps O in position 3, places E in a new position (not 5), and tests common consonants.

Let’s digest the new feedback:

1. From AROSE:  
   - O is in the word and is in the **correct position 3**.  
   - E is in the word but **not in position 5**.  
   - A, R, S are **not** in the word.

2. From BONED:  
   - B, D are **not** in the word.  
   - O is marked “-” (in the word but **wrong position**).  
   - N and E are also marked “-” (in the word but **wrong position**).

But wait: the first feedback already told us O is in the **correct position 3**, so the “-” for O in BONED is **redundant** and confirms our prior conclusion.  
The new information is that **N** and **E** are in the word but **not in positions 3 and 5** respectively.

So the secret word has:
- O fixed in position 3.  
- E somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since it can’t be 5).  
- N somewhere but not in position 3.  
- Letters we can now rule out: A, B, D, R, S.

We need a word that:
- Has O in position 3.  
- Has E in position 1, 2, or 4.  
- Has N somewhere else.  
- Uses only letters not ruled out.

Candidate consonants left: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try placing E in position 2 and N in position 4:  
_ E O N _ → need a consonant in position 1 and 5.  
A good common consonant pair is C and T: C E O N T → “CEONT” is not a word.  
Swap to H and T: H E O N T → “HEONT” not a word.  
Swap to C and H: C E O N H → “CEONH” not a word.  
Swap to T and H: T E O N H → “TEONH” not a word.

Try E in position 1: E _ O _ _  
Need N somewhere else.  
E N O _ _ → N is in position 2 (allowed), need 3 more letters.  
E N O C H → “ENoch” (proper noun).  
E N O C K → “ENOCK” not a word.  
E N O T H → “ENOTH” not a word.  
E N O L D → D is ruled out.  
E N O L Y → “ENOLY” not a word.  
E N O L I → I is untested but “ENOLI” not a word.  
E N O L A → A is ruled out.  
E N O L K → “ENOLK” not a word.  
E N O L T → “ENOLT” not a word.  
E N O L C → “ENOLC” not a word.  
E N O L V → “ENOLV” not a word.  
E N O L W → “ENOLW” not a word.  
E N O L Y → “ENOLY” not a word.

Try E in position 4: _ _ O E _  
Need N somewhere else.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). \n\nOne of the most effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.\n\nAnother strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but ""AROSE"" has slightly better letter frequency coverage. After considering options, I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as the first guess.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).\n- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so it must appear in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).\n- A, R, S are not in the word at all.\n\nSo the secret word looks like: _ _ O _ _ with an E somewhere except position 5.\n\nGood consonants to test next are T, N, L, C, D, etc. Since E must appear, we can try placing it in position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nA strong next guess is ""TOE"" plus two more consonants. ""TOE"" is a good starter because T is common, O is confirmed in position 3, and E is confirmed present. But we need 5 letters. \n\nLet\'s try ""TOWER"" but that has R which we know is out. Instead, ""TOILE"" uses T, I, O, L, E. But I is untested. \n\nBetter: ""TONER"" has R which is out. ""TOWER"" has R. \n\nAlternative: ""OCEAN"" but A is out. \n\nBetter approach: keep O in position 3, place E in position 2, and test common consonants in 1,4,5. \n\nGuess: ""B E O N D"" but that\'s not a word. \n\nHow about ""BEOW_"" but W is untested. \n\nActually, simpler: ""BEOW_"" is not valid. \n\nLet\'s try ""BEAST"" but S is out. \n\n""BEACH"" has A out. \n\n""BELOW"" has L, O, W. But O is correct position. \n\nWait, we need O in position 3. So structure is _ _ O _ _. \n\nLet\'s try ""C"" in position 1, ""H"" in 2, ""O"" in 3, ""D"" in 4, ""E"" in 5: ""CHODE"" but that\'s not a common word. \n\nBetter: ""COBIE"" but B is untested. \n\n""COVEY"" but Y is untested. \n\n""DOPEY"" has Y and D, O, P, E. \n\nBut P is untested. \n\n""DOPEY"" seems valid but let\'s check: D(1), O(3), P(4), E(5), Y(2). But E was in position 5 in AROSE and feedback said E is in word but wrong position, so E cannot be in 5. So ""DOPEY"" is invalid because E would be in 5. \n\nWe need E in 1,2, or 4. \n\nLet\'s try ""PEONY"" but P is untested and N is untested. \n\n""PEONY"" has P, E, O, N, Y. O is in position 3, E is in position 2.

O is in position 3, E must be present but this guess doesn\'t have E. \n\nWe must include E. \n\nSo structure: _ _ O _ _, with E in 1,2, or 4. \n\nLet\'s try ""E"" in position 1: E _ O _ _.

Let’s consolidate all the information we have so far.

Letters that are NOT in the word (eliminated):  
A, B, C, D, R, S, T, W, Y

Letters that ARE in the word (but position unknown):  
O, N, E

Exact positional constraints we now know:
- O is in position 3 (from AROSE).  
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 5 (from AROSE and ETOWN).  
  Therefore E must be in position 2 or 4.  
- N is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from BONED and ETOWN).  
  Therefore N must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (but 5 is still possible).

The word skeleton is:  
_ _ O _ _  
with E and N to place in the remaining three slots (positions 1, 2, 4, 5) obeying the positional bans.

But we only have two letters (E and N) to place in the remaining three open slots, so one of these slots will be empty (no letter).  
However, we need a valid 5-letter word, so the letters must fill the remaining positions exactly once each.

Let’s enumerate the legal placements:

Option 1: E in position 2, N in position 4  
Word shape: _ E O N _  
Need one more letter for position 1 and 5, chosen from the remaining allowed letters: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, X, Z, I, U  
We need a valid word.

Option 2: E in position 2, N in position 5  
Word shape: _ E O _ N  
Need one more letter for position 1 and 4.

Option 3: E in position 4, N in position 1  
Word shape: N _ O E _  
Need one more letter for position 2 and 5.

Option 4: E in position 4, N in position 5  
Word shape: _ _ O E N  
Need one more letter for position 1 and 2.

Let’s test Option 3: N _ O E _  
Position 1: N (allowed)  
Position 2: any allowed letter (F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, X, Z, I, U)  
Position 3: O (fixed)  
Position 4: E (allowed)  
Position 5: any allowed letter

Let’s pick common consonants for positions 2 and 5.

N I O E K → “NIOEK” not a word.  
N I O E M → “NIOEM” not a word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but ""AROSE"" has slightly better letter frequency coverage. After considering options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as the first guess.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so it must appear in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- A, R, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like: _ _ O _ _ with an E somewhere except position 5.

Good consonants to test next are T, N, L, C, D, etc. Since E must appear, we can try placing it in position 1, 2, or 4.

A strong next guess is ""TOE"" plus two more consonants. ""TOE"" is a good starter because T is common, O is confirmed in position 3, and E is confirmed present. But we need 5 letters. 

Let's try ""TOWER"" but that has R which we know is out. Instead, ""TOILE"" uses T, I, O, L, E. But I is untested. 

Better: ""TONER"" has R which is out. ""TOWER"" has R. 

Alternative: ""OCEAN"" but A is out. 

Better approach: keep O in position 3, place E in position 2, and test common consonants in 1,4,5. 

Guess: ""B E O N D"" but that's not a word. 

How about ""BEOW_"" but W is untested. 

Actually, simpler: ""BEOW_"" is not valid. 

Let's try ""BEAST"" but S is out. 

""BEACH"" has A out. 

""BELOW"" has L, O, W. But O is correct position. 

Wait, we need O in position 3. So structure is _ _ O _ _. 

Let's try ""C"" in position 1, ""H"" in 2, ""O"" in 3, ""D"" in 4, ""E"" in 5: ""CHODE"" but that's not a common word. 

Better: ""COBIE"" but B is untested. 

""COVEY"" but Y is untested. 

""DOPEY"" has Y and D, O, P, E. 

But P is untested. 

""DOPEY"" seems valid but let's check: D(1), O(3), P(4), E(5), Y(2). But E was in position 5 in AROSE and feedback said E is in word but wrong position, so E cannot be in 5. So ""DOPEY"" is invalid because E would be in 5. 

We need E in 1,2, or 4. 

Let's try ""PEONY"" but P is untested and N is untested. 

""PEONY"" has P, E, O, N, Y. O is in position 3, E is in position 2. This seems good. 

But ""PEONY"" is a valid word (a type of flower). 

Another option: ""TONER"" but R is out. 

""TONIC"" but I is untested. 

""TONIC"" has T, O, N, I, C. O is in position 3, E must be present but this guess doesn't have E. 

We must include E. 

So structure: _ _ O _ _, with E in 1,2, or 4. 

Let's try ""E"" in position 1: E _ O _ _. Common consonants: ""E"" + ""L"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""D"" -> ""E L O N D"" not a word. 

""E"" + ""A"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""T"" but A is out. 

""E"" + ""D"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""T"" -> ""EDONT"" not a word. 

""E"" + ""M"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""T"" -> ""EMONT"" not a word. 

""E"" + ""T"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""D"" -> ""ETOND"" not a word. 

""E"" in position 2: _ E O _ _. 

Possible: ""B"" + ""E"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""D"" -> ""B E O N D"" not a word. 

""C"" + ""E"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""T"" -> ""C E O N T"" not a word. 

""D"" + ""E"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""T"" -> ""D E O N T"" not a word. 

""E"" in position 4: _ _ O E _. 

Possible: ""C"" + ""O"" + ""B"" + ""E"" + ""D"" -> ""COBED"" not a word. 

""B"" + ""O"" + ""N"" + ""E"" + ""D"" -> ""BONED"" which is valid. 

""BONED"" has B, O, N, E, D. O is in position 3 (correct), E is in position 4 (allowed since it was in position 5 before, now position 4 is new). 

This seems like a good next guess. 

Let's confirm: B, O, N, E, D - all letters are allowed (A, R, S are out, others are in). 

""BONED"" is a valid English word meaning ""broken"" or ""fractured"". 

So the next guess is BONED.Based on the feedback:
- O is correctly in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- A, R, S are not in the word at all.

I'll try a word that keeps O in position 3, places E in a new position (not 5), and tests common consonants.

Guess 2: BONED -> FEEDBACK: B(x) O(-) N(-) E(-) D(x)

Let’s digest the new feedback:

1. From AROSE:  
   - O is in the word and is in the **correct position 3**.  
   - E is in the word but **not in position 5**.  
   - A, R, S are **not** in the word.

2. From BONED:  
   - B, D are **not** in the word.  
   - O is marked “-” (in the word but **wrong position**).  
   - N and E are also marked “-” (in the word but **wrong position**).

But wait: the first feedback already told us O is in the **correct position 3**, so the “-” for O in BONED is **redundant** and confirms our prior conclusion.  
The new information is that **N** and **E** are in the word but **not in positions 3 and 5** respectively.

So the secret word has:
- O fixed in position 3.  
- E somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since it can’t be 5).  
- N somewhere but not in position 3.  
- Letters we can now rule out: A, B, D, R, S.

We need a word that:
- Has O in position 3.  
- Has E in position 1, 2, or 4.  
- Has N somewhere else.  
- Uses only letters not ruled out.

Candidate consonants left: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try placing E in position 2 and N in position 4:  
_ E O N _ → need a consonant in position 1 and 5.  
A good common consonant pair is C and T: C E O N T → “CEONT” is not a word.  
Swap to H and T: H E O N T → “HEONT” not a word.  
Swap to C and H: C E O N H → “CEONH” not a word.  
Swap to T and H: T E O N H → “TEONH” not a word.

Try E in position 1: E _ O _ _  
Need N somewhere else.  
E N O _ _ → N is in position 2 (allowed), need 3 more letters.  
E N O C H → “ENoch” (proper noun).  
E N O C K → “ENOCK” not a word.  
E N O T H → “ENOTH” not a word.  
E N O L D → D is ruled out.  
E N O L Y → “ENOLY” not a word.  
E N O L I → I is untested but “ENOLI” not a word.  
E N O L A → A is ruled out.  
E N O L K → “ENOLK” not a word.  
E N O L T → “ENOLT” not a word.  
E N O L C → “ENOLC” not a word.  
E N O L V → “ENOLV” not a word.  
E N O L W → “ENOLW” not a word.  
E N O L Y → “ENOLY” not a word.

Try E in position 4: _ _ O E _  
Need N somewhere else.  
C O N E Y → C, O, N, E, Y.  
- C: allowed.  
- O: in position 3 (correct).  
- N: in position 2 (allowed).  
- E: in position 4 (allowed).  
- Y: allowed.  
“CONEY” is a valid English word (a type of rabbit).

Let’s check letters ruled out: A, B, D, R, S – none appear in CONEY.

Let’s summarize everything we now know:

Letters ruled out (never appear in the word):  
A, B, C, D, R, S, Y

Letters that ARE in the word (but we still don’t know their exact positions):  
O, N, E

Exact constraints:
- O must be in position 3 (from the very first feedback AROSE).  
- E must appear somewhere but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (from AROSE and CONEY).  
- N must appear somewhere but NOT in position 2 (from CONEY).

So the pattern is:  
_ _ O _ _  
with E and N somewhere among the remaining three slots (positions 1, 2, 4), obeying the positional bans above.

Possible placements:
- E can be in 1, 2, or 4.  
- N can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is already O), so 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s list the remaining legal letters:  
Consonants still allowed: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, X, Z  
Vowels still allowed: I, U (O and E already placed)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.  
- Contains both E and N somewhere legal.  
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.

Candidate construction:
- Position 1: any allowed consonant or vowel (I, U, F, G, H, etc.)  
- Position 2: any allowed letter (but if we place E here, N must go elsewhere)  
- Position 3: O (fixed)  
- Position 4: any allowed letter (could be E or N)  
- Position 5: any allowed letter (could be N)

Let’s try to place E in position 1 and N in position 5:  
E _ O _ N

We need a consonant for position 2 and 4.  
Position 2: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, X, Z  
Position 4: same set

Let’s pick common consonants:  
E F O L N → “EFOLN” not a word.  
E G O L N → “EGOLN” not a word.  
E L O W N → “ELOWN” not a word.  
E L O P N → “ELOPN” not a word.  
E T O N N → “ETONN” not a word.  
E T O W N → “ETOWN” (valid word, short for “Etown” or a place name).

Check constraints:
- O in position 3: ✓  
- E in position 1 (allowed): ✓  
- N in position 5 (allowed): ✓  
- No ruled-out letters: ✓

“ETOWN” is a valid 5-letter English word (a place name).

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after four guesses.

Letters that are **not** in the word at all (eliminated):  
A, B, C, D, R, S, T, W, Y

Letters that **are** in the word (but we still don’t know their exact positions):  
O, N, E

Exact positional constraints:
- O must be in position 3 (from the very first feedback AROSE).  
- E must appear somewhere but **not** in positions 3 or 5 (from AROSE and ETOWN).  
- N must appear somewhere but **not** in positions 2 or 5 (from BONED and ETOWN).

So the word has the fixed pattern:  
_ _ O _ _

And among the remaining three slots (positions 1, 2, 4), the letters E and N must occupy two of them, with the third slot filled by another allowed consonant.

Allowed letters left (not yet eliminated):  
Consonants: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, X, Z  
Vowels: I, U (O and E already placed)

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.  
- Contains both E and N in the remaining four slots, obeying the positional bans.  
- Uses only the still-allowed letters.

Let’s list the possible placements of E and N:

Case 1: E in position 1, N in position 2  
Word pattern: E N O _ _  
We need a consonant for position 4 and 5.  
But N is already in position 2 (allowed), and E in 1 (allowed).  
Possible consonants for 4 and 5: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, X, Z  
We need a valid word of the form ENO??  
ENOF? – not a word.  
ENOG? – not a word.  
ENOL? – ENOL_ – ENOL_ is not a common word.  
ENOM – ENOM is not a word.  
ENOP – ENOP is not a word.  
No obvious common word here.

Case 2: E in position 1, N in position 4  
Pattern: E _ O N _  
We need a consonant for position 2 and 5.  
Possible consonants: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, X, Z  
Looking for a word E _ O N _  
E F O N ? – EFON_ – no.  
E G O N ? – EGON_ – EGONS is plural but not 5 letters.  
E H O N ? – EHON_ – no.  
E J O N ? – EJON_ – no.  
E L O N ? – ELON_ – ELONG is 5 letters but ends with G, not N.  
E M O N ? – EMON_ – no.  
E P O N ? – E P O N _ – EPON_ – no.  
E V O N ? – EVON_ – no.  
No valid word found here.

Case 3: E in position 1, N in position 5  
Pattern: E _ O _ N  
We need a consonant for position 2 and 4.  
Looking for E _ O _ N  
E F O _ N – EFOLN, EFOGN – no.  
E G O _ N – EGOLN, EGOBN – no.  
E H O _ N – EHOLN, EHOBN – no.  
E L O _ N – ELONG (but it’s E L O N G, which is 5 letters).  
ELONG is a valid word (means “to stretch out”).  
Check constraints:  
- O in position 3: ✓  
- E in position 1 (allowed): ✓  
- N in position 5 (allowed): ✓  
- No eliminated letters: ✓  

So “ELONG” fits all constraints.

Case 4: E in position 2, N in position 1  
Pattern: N E O _ _  
We need consonants for positions 4 and 5.  
NEO??  
NEOF? – no.  
NEOG? – no.  
NEOL? – NEOL_ – NEOL is not a word.  
NEOM – NEOM is not a word.  
NEOP – NEOP is not a word.  
No valid word here.

Case 5: E in position 2, N in position 4  
Pattern: _ E O N _  
We need a consonant for positions 1 and 5.  
Looking for _ E O N _

So the only valid word that satisfies all constraints is “ELONG”.
</think>

<guess>ELONG</guess>",ELONG,"Let’s consolidate everything we now know after four guesses.

Letters that are **not** in the word at all (eliminated):  
A, B, C, D, R, S, T, W, Y

Letters that **are** in the word (but we still don’t know their exact positions):  
O, N, E

Exact positional constraints:
- O must be in position 3 (from the very first feedback AROSE).  
- E must appear somewhere but **not** in positions 3 or 5 (from AROSE and ETOWN).  
- N must appear somewhere but **not** in positions 2 or 5 (from BONED and ETOWN).

So the word has the fixed pattern:  
_ _ O _ _

And among the remaining three slots (positions 1, 2, 4), the letters E and N must occupy two of them, with the third slot filled by another allowed consonant.

Allowed letters left (not yet eliminated):  
Consonants: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, X, Z  
Vowels: I, U (O and E already placed)

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.  
- Contains both E and N in the remaining four slots, obeying the positional bans.  
- Uses only the still-allowed letters.

Let’s list the possible placements of E and N:

Case 1: E in position 1, N in position 2  
Word pattern: E N O _ _  
We need a consonant for position 4 and 5.  
But N is already in position 2 (allowed), and E in 1 (allowed).  
Possible consonants for 4 and 5: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, X, Z  
We need a valid word of the form ENO??  
ENOF? – not a word.  
ENOG? – not a word.  
ENOL? – ENOL_ – ENOL_ is not a common word.  
ENOM – ENOM is not a word.  
ENOP – ENOP is not a word.  
No obvious common word here.

Case 2: E in position 1, N in position 4  
Pattern: E _ O N _  
We need a consonant for position 2 and 5.  
Possible consonants: F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, X, Z  
Looking for a word E _ O N _  
E F O N ? – EFON_ – no.  
E G O N ? – EGON_ – EGONS is plural but not 5 letters.  
E H O N ? – EHON_ – no.  
E J O N ? – EJON_ – no.  
E L O N ? – ELON_ – ELONG is 5 letters but ends with G, not N.  
E M O N ? – EMON_ – no.  
E P O N ? – E P O N _ – EPON_ – no.  
E V O N ? – EVON_ – no.  
No valid word found here.

Case 3: E in position 1, N in position 5  
Pattern: E _ O _ N  
We need a consonant for position 2 and 4.  
Looking for E _ O _ N  
E F O _ N – EFOLN, EFOGN – no.  
E G O _ N – EGOLN, EGOBN – no.  
E H O _ N – EHOLN, EHOBN – no.  
E L O _ N – ELONG (but it’s E L O N G, which is 5 letters).  
ELONG is a valid word (means “to stretch out”).  
Check constraints:  
- O in position 3: ✓  
- E in position 1 (allowed): ✓  
- N in position 5 (allowed): ✓  
- No eliminated letters: ✓  

So “ELONG” fits all constraints.

Case 4: E in position 2, N in position 1  
Pattern: N E O _ _  
We need consonants for positions 4 and 5.
