Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters to test as many possibilities as possible. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This will help me quickly identify which of these key letters are in the word and their possible positions.

I want a new word that keeps A, R, S and moves them to fresh positions, while introducing new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (e.g., T, L, N, I, C, D). A good candidate is “TRASH”:

- T, H are new letters  
- R is now in position 2 (was banned from 2, so this is fine)  
- A is now in position 3 (was banned from 1)

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

Letters known to be in the word: A, R, S, T  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: O, E, K  

Positions we now know:
- S is in position 1 (✓)
- T is in position 2 (✓)
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)
- R is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-)

So the secret word looks like: S T _ _ _

Remaining letters that must appear somewhere: A and R  
They must occupy positions 3, 4, or 5, but:
- A cannot be in position 3, so it must be in 4 or 5
- R cannot be in position 4, so it must be in 3, 5 (but not 4)

We need to place A and R in the remaining three slots (positions 3,4,5) with the constraints above.

Possible arrangements:
1. S T A R _  → but R would be in position 4, which is forbidden (from stark feedback)
2. S T _ A R → R in 5 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed)
3. S T R A _ → R in 3 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed)
4. S T _ R A → R in 4 (forbidden)

So valid patterns:
- S T _ A R
- S T R A _

We need to pick a 5-letter word that fits one of these patterns and uses only letters we know are allowed (no O, E, K). Also, we want to test new letters if possible.

Looking at the first pattern S T _ A R:
- The blank must be a letter we haven't ruled out. Allowed letters so far: A, R, S, T plus any others not yet tested (e.g., C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). But we want to keep it simple.

Possible words:
- STAIR (but I is untested, A is in 4, R in 5) → fits pattern
- STAND (but N is untested, D is untested) → but A is in 3 which is forbidden (from stark feedback A is not in 3)
- STARK → already tried, K is forbidden

Looking at the second pattern S T R A _:
- The blank must be a new letter (since A and R are already placed)
- Possible words: STRAW (but W is untested), STRAP (P is untested), etc.

Between these, ""STAIR"" seems like a good choice because:
- It fits the pattern S T _ A R
- Uses I (a new letter) to test position 3
- Uses A in 4 and R in 5, which are both allowed by the constraints

They must occupy positions 3, 4, or 5, but:
- A cannot be in position 3, so it must be in 4 or 5
- R cannot be in position 4, so it must be in 3, 5 (but not 4)

We need to place A and R in the remaining three slots (positions 3,4,5) with the constraints above.

Possible arrangements:
1. S T A R _  → but R would be in position 4, which is forbidden (from stark feedback)
2. S T _ A R → R in 5 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed)
3. S T R A _ → R in 3 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed)
4. S T _ R A → R in 4 (forbidden)

So valid patterns:
- S T _ A R
- S T R A _

We need to pick a 5-letter word that fits one of these patterns and uses only letters we know are allowed (no O, E, K). Also, we want to test new letters if possible.

Looking at the first pattern S T _ A R:
- The blank must be a letter we haven't ruled out. Allowed letters so far: A, R, S, T plus any others not yet tested (e.g., C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). But we want to keep it simple.

Possible words:
- STAIR (but I is untested, A is in 4, R in 5) → fits pattern
- STAND (but N is untested, D is untested) → but A is in 3 which is forbidden (from stark feedback A is not in 3)
- STARK → already tried, K is forbidden

Looking at the second pattern S T R A _:
- The blank must be a new letter (since A and R are already placed)
- Possible words: STRAW (but W is untested), STRAP (P is untested), etc.

Between these, ""STAIR"" seems like a good choice because:
- It fits the pattern S T _ A R
- Uses I (a new letter) to test position 3
- Uses A in 4 and R in 5, which are both allowed by the constraints

Let's go with ""STAIR"".

Letters that are in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
- A (from arose, it is NOT in position 1; from stair, it is NOT in position 3)
- R (from arose, it is NOT in position 2; from stair, it is NOT in position 5)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:

So the pattern so far is:

Remaining letters to place: A and R
Allowed positions for A: 4 or 5 (cannot be 1, 2, or 3)

We need to fill positions 3, 4, 5 with A and R plus one more letter that has not been ruled out (must be from the remaining alphabet excluding O, E, K, I).

Let’s enumerate the possibilities:

1. Position 3 = R, position 4 = A, position 5 = new letter

   Allowed new letters (not yet ruled out): C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, Z
   Possible words: STRAG, STRAP, STRAW, STRAY, etc.

2. Position 3 = new letter, position 4 = R, position 5 = A

   Allowed new letters: same as above
   Possible words: ST CRA (invalid), S T U R A (invalid), S T R U A (invalid), but valid words include:
   - STRGA (invalid), STURA (invalid), but actual valid words: STURA is not common, STRGA no.
   - Actually, common valid words: STURA is a river, but not sure if valid. Let’s think better.

3. Position 3 = new letter, position 4 = A, position 5 = R

   Allowed new letters: same
   Valid words: STCAR (invalid), STGAR (invalid), STMAR (invalid), STNAR (invalid), but:
   - STCAR is invalid, STGAR invalid, but STMAR is invalid, STNAR invalid.
   - Actually, common valid word: STAND (but A is in 3 which is forbidden), so none obvious.

4. Position 3 = A, position 4 = R, position 5 = new letter
   → S T A R _

   But R is in position 4, which is forbidden (from stair, R is not in 5, but can it be in 4? Yes, only forbidden positions for R are 2 and 5. So this is allowed.
   Possible words: STARE (but E is forbidden), STARK (K forbidden), STARS (S already used), STAID (I forbidden), STARD (D allowed) → STARD is not a word.
   - STAUN (invalid), STARY (invalid), STAFF (invalid), STAID (I invalid).

From these, the most promising valid word seems ""STRA_"" with a valid letter in 5. The only common valid word that fits is ""STRA_"" plus a valid letter. The most likely is ""STRAW"" (W not yet ruled out).

Let’s check:
STRAW:
- S(✓) T(✓) R(3) A(4) W(new)
- R is in 3 (allowed), A is in 4 (allowed), W is new (not ruled out)
This fits all constraints.

Alternative: STRAP (P new), but P is less common than W.
Between STRAW and STRAP, STRAW is more common.

Thus, the best next guess is STRAW.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters to test as many possibilities as possible. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This will help me quickly identify which of these key letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2  
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word  
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4  
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word  

So the secret word:
- contains A, R, S  
- does NOT contain O or E  
- A is not in spot 1, R is not in spot 2, S is not in spot 4  

I want a new word that keeps A, R, S and moves them to fresh positions, while introducing new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (e.g., T, L, N, I, C, D). A good candidate is “TRASH”:

- T, H are new letters  
- R is now in position 2 (was banned from 2, so this is fine)  
- A is now in position 3 (was banned from 1)  
- S is now in position 4 (was banned from 4 → oops, conflict)  

Let me pick another word: “CRASH”:

- C, H new  
- R in 2 (allowed)  
- A in 3 (allowed)  
- S in 4 (still banned from 4)  

Next: “STARK”:

- S in 1 (allowed)  
- T, K new  
- A in 3 (allowed)  
- R in 4 (allowed)  

This looks good. It keeps A, R, S in fresh positions and adds T, K.

- A cannot be in position 3, so it must be in 4 or 5

3. S T R A _ → R in 3 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed)

We need to pick a 5-letter word that fits one of these patterns and uses only letters we know are allowed (no O, E, K). Also, we want to test new letters if possible.

Looking at the first pattern S T _ A R:
- The blank must be a letter we haven't ruled out. Allowed letters so far: A, R, S, T plus any others not yet tested (e.g., C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). But we want to keep it simple.

Possible words:
- STAIR (but I is untested, A is in 4, R in 5) → fits pattern
- STAND (but N is untested, D is untested) → but A is in 3 which is forbidden (from stark feedback A is not in 3)
- STARK → already tried, K is forbidden

Looking at the second pattern S T R A _:
- The blank must be a new letter (since A and R are already placed)
- Possible words: STRAW (but W is untested), STRAP (P is untested), etc.

Between these, ""STAIR"" seems like a good choice because:
- It fits the pattern S T _ A R

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters to test as many possibilities as possible. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This will help me quickly identify which of these key letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2  
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word  
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4  
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word  

So the secret word:
- contains A, R, S  
- does NOT contain O or E  
- A is not in spot 1, R is not in spot 2, S is not in spot 4  

I want a new word that keeps A, R, S and moves them to fresh positions, while introducing new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (e.g., T, L, N, I, C, D). A good candidate is “TRASH”:

- T, H are new letters  
- R is now in position 2 (was banned from 2, so this is fine)  
- A is now in position 3 (was banned from 1)  
- S is now in position 4 (was banned from 4 → oops, conflict)  

Let me pick another word: “CRASH”:

- C, H new  
- R in 2 (allowed)  
- A in 3 (allowed)  
- S in 4 (still banned from 4)  

Next: “STARK”:

- S in 1 (allowed)  
- T, K new  
- A in 3 (allowed)  
- R in 4 (allowed)  

This looks good. It keeps A, R, S in fresh positions and adds T, K.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: stark -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) A(-) R(-) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

Letters known to be in the word: A, R, S, T  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: O, E, K  

Positions we now know:
- S is in position 1 (✓)
- T is in position 2 (✓)
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)
- R is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-)

So the secret word looks like: S T _ _ _

Remaining letters that must appear somewhere: A and R  
They must occupy positions 3, 4, or 5, but:
- A cannot be in position 3, so it must be in 4 or 5
- R cannot be in position 4, so it must be in 3, 5 (but not 4)

We need to place A and R in the remaining three slots (positions 3,4,5) with the constraints above.

Possible arrangements:
1. S T A R _  → but R would be in position 4, which is forbidden (from stark feedback)
2. S T _ A R → R in 5 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed)
3. S T R A _ → R in 3 (allowed), A in 4 (allowed)
4. S T _ R A → R in 4 (forbidden)

So valid patterns:
- S T _ A R
- S T R A _

We need to pick a 5-letter word that fits one of these patterns and uses only letters we know are allowed (no O, E, K). Also, we want to test new letters if possible.

Looking at the first pattern S T _ A R:
- The blank must be a letter we haven't ruled out. Allowed letters so far: A, R, S, T plus any others not yet tested (e.g., C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). But we want to keep it simple.

Possible words:
- STAIR (but I is untested, A is in 4, R in 5) → fits pattern
- STAND (but N is untested, D is untested) → but A is in 3 which is forbidden (from stark feedback A is not in 3)
- STARK → already tried, K is forbidden

Looking at the second pattern S T R A _:
- The blank must be a new letter (since A and R are already placed)
- Possible words: STRAW (but W is untested), STRAP (P is untested), etc.

Between these, ""STAIR"" seems like a good choice because:
- It fits the pattern S T _ A R
- Uses I (a new letter) to test position 3
- Uses A in 4 and R in 5, which are both allowed by the constraints

Let's go with ""STAIR"".

Guess 3: stair -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) A(-) I(x) R(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

Letters that are in the word and their fixed positions:
- S is in position 1 (✓ from stark and stair)
- T is in position 2 (✓ from stark and stair)

Letters that are in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
- A (from arose, it is NOT in position 1; from stair, it is NOT in position 3)
- R (from arose, it is NOT in position 2; from stair, it is NOT in position 5)

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- O, E, K, I

So the pattern so far is:
S T _ _ _

Remaining letters to place: A and R
Allowed positions for A: 4 or 5 (cannot be 1, 2, or 3)
Allowed positions for R: 3 or 4 (cannot be 2, 5, or 1)

We need to fill positions 3, 4, 5 with A and R plus one more letter that has not been ruled out (must be from the remaining alphabet excluding O, E, K, I).

Let’s enumerate the possibilities:

1. Position 3 = R, position 4 = A, position 5 = new letter
   → S T R A _

   Allowed new letters (not yet ruled out): C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, Z
   Possible words: STRAG, STRAP, STRAW, STRAY, etc.

2. Position 3 = new letter, position 4 = R, position 5 = A
   → S T _ R A

   Allowed new letters: same as above
   Possible words: ST CRA (invalid), S T U R A (invalid), S T R U A (invalid), but valid words include:
   - STRGA (invalid), STURA (invalid), but actual valid words: STURA is not common, STRGA no.
   - Actually, common valid words: STURA is a river, but not sure if valid. Let’s think better.

3. Position 3 = new letter, position 4 = A, position 5 = R
   → S T _ A R

   Allowed new letters: same
   Valid words: STCAR (invalid), STGAR (invalid), STMAR (invalid), STNAR (invalid), but:
   - STCAR is invalid, STGAR invalid, but STMAR is invalid, STNAR invalid.
   - Actually, common valid word: STAND (but A is in 3 which is forbidden), so none obvious.

4. Position 3 = A, position 4 = R, position 5 = new letter
   → S T A R _

   But R is in position 4, which is forbidden (from stair, R is not in 5, but can it be in 4? Yes, only forbidden positions for R are 2 and 5. So this is allowed.
   Possible words: STARE (but E is forbidden), STARK (K forbidden), STARS (S already used), STAID (I forbidden), STARD (D allowed) → STARD is not a word.
   - STAUN (invalid), STARY (invalid), STAFF (invalid), STAID (I invalid).

From these, the most promising valid word seems ""STRA_"" with a valid letter in 5. The only common valid word that fits is ""STRA_"" plus a valid letter. The most likely is ""STRAW"" (W not yet ruled out).

Let’s check:
STRAW:
- S(✓) T(✓) R(3) A(4) W(new)
- R is in 3 (allowed), A is in 4 (allowed), W is new (not ruled out)
This fits all constraints.

Alternative: STRAP (P new), but P is less common than W.
Between STRAW and STRAP, STRAW is more common.

Thus, the best next guess is STRAW.
