### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and common consonants to maximize information gain. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). This will help me quickly identify which vowels are present and their positions, as well as whether R or S are in the word.

A good next guess should test new consonants and positions. Let’s try a word like “SOAKS”:
- It has S, A, O (confirmed letters)
- It introduces K and another S
- It avoids R and E
- Positions: S (not pos 4), A (not pos 1), O (not pos 3)

Let’s update what we now know after both guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is not in the word.
- O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word.

From Guess 2 (SOAKS):
- S is correct in position 1 (✓).
- O is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- K is not in the word.
- S is in the word but not in position 5 (we already know it’s fixed in position 1, so this is consistent).

So far:
- Confirmed letters: S (fixed in position 1), A, O
- Letters ruled out: R, E, K
- Positions we still need to determine: 2, 3, 4, 5 (but position 1 is S)
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 3

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Contains both A and O in remaining allowed positions
3. Does not contain R, E, K
4. Uses only valid English words

Possible positions left:
- A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5
- O can be in positions 1 (but 1 is S), 4, or 5 (but 1 is S, so 4 or 5)

Let’s try to construct a word:
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- We need to place A and O in positions 2,4,5 with constraints:
  - A not in 3 (already not possible here)
  - O not in 2 or 3
- Let’s try A in position 2 and O in position 4:
  - S A _ O _
- Now we need two more letters for positions 3 and 5, avoiding R, E, K
- Common unused consonants: T, N, L, C, D, etc.
- Let’s try S A T O N (but N is okay)
- Check if SATON is a valid word – it seems like a proper noun (a type of coin), not a common English word.
- Try S A L O N – SALON is a valid word
- Check constraints:
  - S in 1: ✓
  - A in 2: allowed (not 1 or 3)
  - O in 4: allowed (not 2 or 3)
  - No R, E, K
  - SALON is a valid English word

From all feedback so far:

1. S is fixed in position 1 (✓).
2. A is fixed in position 2 (✓).
3. O is fixed in position 4 (✓).
4. Letters ruled out: R, E, K, L, N.
5. We still need to determine positions 3 and 5.
6. Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we already know A, O, S are used).

The pattern so far is: S A _ O _

We need two new letters for positions 3 and 5, avoiding the ruled-out set. Let’s look for common consonants that fit.

Possible candidates:
- Position 3: common consonants left are B, C, D, F, G, H, M, P, T
- Position 5: same set, but often vowels are used here (I, U) or common consonants

Let’s try common combinations:
- S A C O _ : SAC_? Need a valid word. SACRO is too long, SAC is short.
- S A D O _ : SAD_? SADLY is 5 letters, but L is ruled out.
- S A M O _ : SAM_? SAMOVAR is too long.
- S A P O _ : SAP_? SAPPY is 5 letters, but P and Y are allowed.
- S A T O _ : SAT_? SATUR is not a word, SATIN is 5 letters but N is ruled out.
- S A B O _ : SAB_? SABLE is 5 letters, but L is ruled out.
- S A F O _ : SAF_? SAFER is 5 letters, but E is ruled out.
- S A H O _ : SAH_? SAHO? Not a common word.
- S A I O _ : SAIO? Not a word.
- S A U O _ : SAU_? SAU is short for SAUCE, but not a word.

Wait, let’s think of actual 5-letter words that fit S A _ O _.

Examples:
- S A C O N – N is ruled out.
- S A C O U – U is allowed, but SACOU is not a word.
- S A D O R – R is ruled out.
- S A D O M – M is allowed, but SADOM is not a word.
- S A F O R – R is ruled out.
- S A F O N – N is ruled out.
- S A G O N – N is ruled out.
- S A G O T – T is allowed, SAGOT is not a word.
- S A H O N – N is ruled out.
- S A H O K – K is ruled out.
- S A I O N – N is ruled out.
- S A I O T – T is allowed, but SAION is not a word.
- S A M O R – R is ruled out.
- S A M O N – N is ruled out.
- S A M O K – K is ruled out.
- S A M O T – T is allowed, but SAMOT is not a word.
- S A P O N – N is ruled out.
- S A P O T – T is allowed, but SAPOT is not a word.
- S A T O N – N is ruled out.
- S A T O M – M is allowed, but SATOM is not a word.
- S A T O K – K is ruled out.
- S A T O I – I is allowed, but SATOI is not a word.
- S A T O U – U is allowed, but SATOU is not a word.
- S A V O R – R is ruled out.
- S A V O N – N is ruled out.
- S A V O I – I is allowed, but SAIOV is not a word.
- S A V O T – T is allowed, but SAINT is 5 letters but N is ruled out.

Hmm, maybe we need to consider that position 5 could be a vowel like I or U.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words that start with SA and have O in 4th position:

SAINT – N is ruled out.
SAVOR – R is ruled out.
SAMOA – A is already used in position 2, and A is already fixed.
SAVOY – Y is allowed, but O is in position 4, so SAV O Y? Wait, the word would be SAV O Y, but that’s 5 letters: S A V O Y.
Check constraints:
- S in 1: ✓
- A in 2: ✓
- V in 3: allowed
- O in 4: ✓
- Y in 5: allowed
- Letters used: S, A, V, O, Y – none of R, E, K, L, N
- SAVOY is a valid English word (a region in France)

This seems to fit all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be SAVOY.
