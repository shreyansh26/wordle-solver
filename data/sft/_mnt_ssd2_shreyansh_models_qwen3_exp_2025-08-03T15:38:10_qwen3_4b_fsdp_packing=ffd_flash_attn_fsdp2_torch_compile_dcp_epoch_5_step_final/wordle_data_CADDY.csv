### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on “arose” we know:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in slot 1).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A somewhere other than the first letter.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has an A in positions 2-5.
2. Avoids R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, F, Y, W, V, X, Z, Q, J.

I’ll pick a word that places A in a different spot and uses high-value consonants. “PLANT” uses P, L, N, T and places A in slot 3. It avoids R, O, S, E. This should tell me more about consonant clusters and the position of A.

(Another candidate could be “CHANT” or “CLANG”, but “PLANT” feels slightly more common and balanced.)

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T  
Letters that ARE in the word (but in the wrong positions so far): A

So:
- The word must contain A, and A is not in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (because it was wrong in positions 1, 3, 4, and 5 in the two guesses).  
  Therefore A must be in position 2.

- The remaining letters (positions 1, 3, 4, 5) must be chosen from the unused alphabet, excluding R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, Z, Q, J, X, etc.

We need two more vowels. The only other vowel not ruled out is I or U.  
So possible patterns: C H A I D, B A C K ?, etc.

Let’s try a word that places A in position 2, uses high-frequency remaining letters, and introduces new vowels.  
A good candidate is “CHAID” (though not a common English word). A better common word is “CHAFF” but F is repeated. Another is “CHAIR” but R is out.  
Next best: “CHAPE” but P and E are out.  
“CHAUD” is valid (French loanword, but acceptable in Scrabble lists).  
“CHARD” is good: C, H, A, R, D – but R is out.  
“CAMPS” – P, S out.  
“CANDY” – N out.  
“CAGED” – G, D acceptable.  
“CAGED” has A in position 3 which we know is wrong.

Wait, A must be in position 2. So we need: _ A _ _ _

Let’s list valid 5-letter words with A in position 2, avoiding all excluded letters.

Excluded letters: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T  
Allowed letters: A (fixed in pos 2), plus B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, Z, Q, J, X

Possible words:
- B A C K ? – B, A, C, K, ? – need a fifth letter. “BACKS” – S out. “BACKY” – Y acceptable. “BACKY” is valid.
- C A M B ? – “CAMBS” – S out.  
- C A B I N – N out.  
- H A I D ? – “HAIDS” – S out.  
- M A C H Y – valid word? Yes, “MACHY” (though rare).  
- C A V I D – “CAV ID” not a word.  
- D A I L Y – L out.  
- B A I N S – N, S out.  
- C A R T S – R, T, S out.  
- C A D I E – E out.  
- C A G I E – E out.

- C A B I N – N out.  
- C A B I N – N out.  
- C A B I N – N out.  
- C A B I N – N out.

Looking at valid Scrabble words:  
“BACKY” is Scrabble-legal.  
“CABIN” – N out.  
“CHAIR” – R out.  
“CHAFF” – F repeated.  
“CHAUD” – valid.  
“CHAUD” uses C, H, A, U, D – all allowed.  
“CHAUD” is a good choice.

Let me verify:  
C – allowed  
H – allowed  
A – must be in position 2 – correct here  
U – allowed  
D – allowed  

No excluded letters.  
So “CHAUD” is a valid next guess.

  Therefore A must be in position 2.

- The remaining letters (positions 1, 3, 4, 5) must be chosen from the unused alphabet, excluding R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, Z, Q, J, X, etc.

We need two more vowels. The only other vowel not ruled out is I or U.  
So possible patterns: C H A I D, B A C K ?, etc.

Let’s try a word that places A in position 2, uses high-frequency remaining letters, and introduces new vowels.  
A good candidate is “CHAID” (though not a common English word). A better common word is “CHAFF” but F is repeated. Another is “CHAIR” but R is out.  
Next best: “CHAPE” but P and E are out.  
“CHAUD” is valid (French loanword, but acceptable in Scrabble lists).  
“CHARD” is good: C, H, A, R, D – but R is out.  
“CAMPS” – P, S out.  
“CANDY” – N out.  
“CAGED” – G, D acceptable.  
“CAGED” has A in position 3 which we know is wrong.

Wait, A must be in position 2. So we need: _ A _ _ _

Let’s list valid 5-letter words with A in position 2, avoiding all excluded letters.

Excluded letters: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T  
Allowed letters: A (fixed in pos 2), plus B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, Z, Q, J, X

Possible words:
- B A C K ? – B, A, C, K, ? – need a fifth letter. “BACKS” – S out. “BACKY” – Y acceptable. “BACKY” is valid.
- C A M B ? – “CAMBS” – S out.  
- C A B I N – N out.  
- H A I D ? – “HAIDS” – S out.  
- M A C H Y – valid word? Yes, “MACHY” (though rare).  
- C A V I D – “CAV ID” not a word.  
- D A I L Y – L out.  
- B A I N S – N, S out.  
- C A R T S – R, T, S out.  
- C A D I E – E out.  
- C A G I E – E out.  
- C A M I D – “CAMID” not a word.  
- C A M I C – “CAMIC” not a word.  
- C A M I N – N out.  
- C A M I D – not found.  
- C A B I N – N out.  
- C A B I N – N out.  
- C A B I N – N out.  
- C A B I N – N out.

Looking at valid Scrabble words:  
“BACKY” is Scrabble-legal.  
“CABIN” – N out.  
“CHAIR” – R out.  
“CHAFF” – F repeated.  
“CHAUD” – valid.  
“CHAUD” uses C, H, A, U, D – all allowed.  
“CHAUD” is a good choice.

Let me verify:  
C – allowed  
H – allowed  
A – must be in position 2 – correct here  
U – allowed  
D – allowed  

No excluded letters.  
So “CHAUD” is a valid next guess.

From the three guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word:  
R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, H, U

Letters that ARE in the word and their correct positions:  
C is in position 1 (✓)  
A is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from guesses 1, 2, 3)  
D is in the word but not in position 5 (from guess 3)

Since A must appear somewhere and cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5, the only remaining spot for A is position 2.

So the word structure is:  
C A _ _ _

We still need three more letters, none of which can be any of the excluded letters (R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, H, U).  
Allowed letters left: B, F, G, I, K, M, V, W, Y, Z, Q, J, X

We also know D must appear somewhere in the word (from feedback D(-)), but D cannot be in position 5 (from guess 3).  
So D must be in position 3 or 4.

Possible patterns:  
C A D _ _  or  C A _ D _

Let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns using only the allowed letters:

1. C A D _ _  
   - CADRE – R excluded  
   - CADGE – G, E – E excluded  
   - CADDY – Y, D – D already used, but let’s check: C, A, D, D, Y – all allowed letters, and D appears twice which is fine.  
     “CADDY” is a valid word.

2. C A _ D _  
   - CABLE – B, L – L excluded  
   - CACOD – not a valid word  
   - CAFOD – not a valid word  
   - CAMID – not a valid word  
   - CAVID – not a valid word  
   - CAYOD – not a valid word  

“CADDY” seems to be the only common word that fits all constraints:
- C in position 1 (✓)  
- A in position 2 (only remaining spot)  
- D in position 3 (allowed)  
- Y in position 5 (allowed)  
- D in position 4 (allowed, and D must appear somewhere)

Let’s verify no excluded letters are used: C, A, D, D, Y – none of R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, H, U appear.  
“CADDY” is valid.
