### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities for the secret word.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): A is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and O, but not R, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1, and O is not in position 3.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and O (and possibly other letters not yet ruled out).
2. Does not use R, S, or E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1 and O somewhere other than position 3.

Good consonants to try next are T, N, L, C, D, etc. Let me think of words that fit these constraints. ""TOADY"" comes to mind, but it has an E in the form of ""Y"" which might not be helpful. ""CLOAK"" uses C, L, O, A, K - but K is less common. ""MOUNT"" has U and N, but no A. ""PLAID"" has P, L, A, I, D - but I is a vowel and might be useful. However, ""PLAID"" has A in position 3 which conflicts with O not being in position 3, but A could still be in position 3 - wait, the feedback only said O is not in position 3, not A. So ""PLAID"" could work.

But let me think of something simpler. ""CLOAK"" has A in position 4, O in position 2 - that seems good. It uses C, L, O, A, K - none of which are ruled out except maybe K. Alternatively, ""COAST"" has S which is ruled out. ""COBIA"" has B and I, but B is less common. 

Another option is ""MANGO"" - but G is less common. ""TONAL"" has T, O, N, A, L - this seems good. O is in position 2 (allowed), A is in position 4 (allowed), and none of the letters are ruled out except R, S, E which aren't present. 

I think ""TONAL"" is a strong next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are in the word and in the correct positions:
   - T is in position 1
   - O is in position 2
   - N is in position 3

2. Letters that are in the word but not in the positions guessed:
   - A is in the word but not in position 4 (and from the first guess we also know it's not in position 1)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   - R, S, E, L

So the pattern so far is: T O N _ _

We still need two more letters, neither of which can be R, S, E, L.  
Also, A must appear somewhere in the remaining two positions (since we know A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4).

Possible letters left (excluding ruled-out ones): A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with TON and contains A exactly once (since we only have confirmation of one A).  
The A must therefore be in position 4 or 5, but from the first guess we know A is NOT in position 4, so A must be in position 5.

Thus the word must be: T O N _ A

We now need a valid 5-letter word of the form TON_A.  
Common words that fit: TONCA (not valid), TONFA (not valid), TONSA (not valid), TONIA (not valid), TONGA (valid), TONMA (not valid), TONPA (not valid), TONWA (not valid).

The only valid English word that fits is TONGA.  
Let me check: TONGA is a valid 5-letter word (a type of drum or a former British colony). It uses letters we haven't ruled out and satisfies all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be TONGA.
