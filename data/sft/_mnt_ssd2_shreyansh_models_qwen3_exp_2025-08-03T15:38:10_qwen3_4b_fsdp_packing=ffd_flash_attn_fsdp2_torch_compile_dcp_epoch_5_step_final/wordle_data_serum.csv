### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible

Looking at these criteria, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique
- These letters appear frequently in 5-letter English words
- It gives us a good spread to see which letters might be in the secret word

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (like A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible

Looking at these criteria, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are unique
- These letters appear frequently in 5-letter English words
- It gives us a good spread to see which letters might be in the secret word

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So we know:
- Letters in the word: R, S, E
- Letters not in the word: A, O
- Positions to avoid for R, S, E: R≠2, S≠4, E≠5

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R, S, E (since they are confirmed in the word)
2. Does NOT contain A or O
3. Places R, S, E in positions they haven't been tried yet

Possible positions for R, S, E:
- R could be 1,3,4,5
- S could be 1,2,3,5
- E could be 1,2,3,4

Let's try to construct a word:
- Let's try to place E in position 1 (new position)
- R in position 3
- S in position 2
- Need two more letters that are not A or O, and haven't been tested yet

Good unused consonants: T, N, L, C, D, etc.
Good unused vowels: I, U

Let's try ""TRIES"":
- T (new)
- R (position 2 - but R cannot be in position 2 from feedback)
Oops, R cannot be in position 2, so this is invalid.

Let's try ""SERFS"":
- S (position 1)
- E (position 2)
- R (position 3)
- F (new)
- S (position 5)

But S appears twice, and we don't know if letters can repeat yet. It's safer to avoid repeats for now.

Let's try ""STEER"":
- S (position 1)

- E (position 3)
- E (position 4) - but E appears twice, again risky.

Let's try ""REIST"":

Invalid.

Let's try ""STERN"":

Check positions:
- R is in position 4 (allowed)
- S is in position 1 (allowed)
- E is in position 3 (allowed)
- No A or O

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: AROSE

Round 2: STERN

So far we know:

2. Contains R and E in permissible positions.  
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no A, O, T, N).  

Permissible positions:
- R can be 1, 3, 5 (but 1 is already S) → 3 or 5  
- E can be 1, 2, 4 (but 1 is S) → 2 or 4  

Let’s try:

- S _ E R _  (E at 3 is invalid)  
- S E _ _ R  (E at 2, R at 5) → SE _ _ R  
  Need two more letters from remaining unused ones (common: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.).  

Try “SEWER”:
- S(1) ✓

- W(3) new  
- E(4) but E cannot be at 4 (from STERN feedback: E(-) at 3 implies only positions 1,2,4 left; but 4 is allowed? Wait: STERN had E at 3 marked (-), so E is not at 3, but could be at 1,2,4,5. However, S is already at 1, so E could be 2 or 4.  
In “SEWER”, E appears twice (positions 2 and 4) – we don’t know yet if duplicates are allowed, but it’s safer to avoid for now.

Try “SUGER”:

Current known facts:

Letters in the word (must appear somewhere):
- S (fixed at position 1)
- R
- E

Letters NOT in the word:
- A, O, T, N, G

Letters whose status is unknown (but not yet ruled out):
- U (from SUGER: U(-) means it is in the word but in the wrong position)

So the word is S _ _ _ _, and must contain R, E, and U in some positions, with no A, O, T, N, G.

Positions to avoid for each known letter:
- R: not 2, 4, 5 (from AROSE and STERN/SUGER) → R must be at 3
- E: not 3, 5 (from AROSE and STERN/SUGER) → E must be at 2 or 4
- U: not 2 (from SUGER) → U can be at 3, 4, 5 (but 3 is taken by R) → U must be at 4 or 5

But we also know:
- R must be at position 3 (only remaining spot)
- So the word is S _ R _ _

Now E must be at 2 or 4, and U must be at 4 or 5, with no conflicts.

Case 1: E at 2, U at 4 or 5
Word structure: S E R U _ or S E R _ U

Case 2: E at 4, U at 5
Word structure: S _ R E U

We need to check which of these patterns form valid 5-letter English words using allowed letters (no A, O, T, N, G).

Case 1:
- S E R U _ : Need a 5th letter at position 5, not forbidden. Common letters left: C, D, F, H, I, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
  - SERUM is a valid word (but U is already at 4, so SERUM would have U at 4 and M at 5 - but SERUM has U at 4 and M at 5, which fits S E R U M. However, SERUM is a valid word, but we need to check if it uses allowed letters - M is allowed.

Case 2:
- S _ R E U : Need a letter at position 2. Possible letters: C, D, F, H, I, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
  - SCREW: S C R E W - C and W are allowed. This is a valid word.

Between SERUM and SCREW, both fit the constraints. SCREW seems more common as a guess.

  Need two more letters from remaining unused ones (common: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.).  

Try “SEWER”:
- S(1) ✓  
- E(2) ✓  
- W(3) new  
- E(4) but E cannot be at 4 (from STERN feedback: E(-) at 3 implies only positions 1,2,4 left; but 4 is allowed? Wait: STERN had E at 3 marked (-), so E is not at 3, but could be at 1,2,4,5. However, S is already at 1, so E could be 2 or 4.  
In “SEWER”, E appears twice (positions 2 and 4) – we don’t know yet if duplicates are allowed, but it’s safer to avoid for now.

Try “SUGER”:
- S(1) ✓  
- U(2) new  
- G(3) new  
- E(4) allowed  
- R(5) allowed  
No forbidden letters, all unique, positions valid.

This seems good.

Current known facts:

Letters in the word (must appear somewhere):
- S (fixed at position 1)
- R
- E

Letters NOT in the word:
- A, O, T, N, G

Letters whose status is unknown (but not yet ruled out):
- U (from SUGER: U(-) means it is in the word but in the wrong position)

So the word is S _ _ _ _, and must contain R, E, and U in some positions, with no A, O, T, N, G.

Positions to avoid for each known letter:
- R: not 2, 4, 5 (from AROSE and STERN/SUGER) → R must be at 3
- E: not 3, 5 (from AROSE and STERN/SUGER) → E must be at 2 or 4
- U: not 2 (from SUGER) → U can be at 3, 4, 5 (but 3 is taken by R) → U must be at 4 or 5

But we also know:
- R must be at position 3 (only remaining spot)
- So the word is S _ R _ _

Now E must be at 2 or 4, and U must be at 4 or 5, with no conflicts.

Case 1: E at 2, U at 4 or 5
Word structure: S E R U _ or S E R _ U

Case 2: E at 4, U at 5
Word structure: S _ R E U

We need to check which of these patterns form valid 5-letter English words using allowed letters (no A, O, T, N, G).

Case 1:
- S E R U _ : Need a 5th letter at position 5, not forbidden. Common letters left: C, D, F, H, I, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
  - SERUM is a valid word (but U is already at 4, so SERUM would have U at 4 and M at 5 - but SERUM has U at 4 and M at 5, which fits S E R U M. However, SERUM is a valid word, but we need to check if it uses allowed letters - M is allowed.

Case 2:
- S _ R E U : Need a letter at position 2. Possible letters: C, D, F, H, I, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
  - SCREW: S C R E W - C and W are allowed. This is a valid word.

Between SERUM and SCREW, both fit the constraints. SCREW seems more common as a guess.

Let's verify:
- SCREW: S(✓) C(new) R(3) E(4) W(new)
Positions:
- S at 1 ✓
- C at 2 (new position, allowed)
- R at 3 (must be here)
- E at 4 (allowed, not forbidden positions)
- W at 5 (new, allowed)
No forbidden letters (A, O, T, N, G) used.

From the latest feedback on SCREW:
- S(✓) – S is correct in position 1.
- C(x) – C is not in the word.
- R(✓) – R is correct in position 3.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 4.
- W(x) – W is not in the word.

Combining all constraints so far:

1. Letters fixed:
   - Position 1: S
   - Position 3: R

2. Letters in the word but not yet placed:
   - E (cannot be in positions 3, 4, 5 from earlier feedback; the only remaining spot is position 2).

3. Letters known NOT in the word:
   - A, O, T, N, G, C, W

4. Remaining positions to fill (positions 4 and 5) must use letters not yet ruled out and not already used (S, R, E).

Possible letters left (excluding forbidden ones): B, D, F, H, I, K, L, M, P, V, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word with the pattern:
S E R _ _

The only common English word that fits is SERUM, but U has not been ruled out yet (it was marked ""-"" in position 2 of SUGER, meaning it's in the word but not there). However, in SERUM, U would be in position 4, which is allowed.

But SERUM uses U in position 4, which hasn't been ruled out. Let me check if there are any other possibilities.

Another option is SERFS, but F is allowed and S is already used in position 1, but SERFS would have F in position 5, but we have to check if all letters are allowed. However, SERFS uses S twice, which might not be optimal.

Looking at common words, SERUM seems to be the most likely candidate. Let me verify:
- SERUM: S(1), E(2), R(3), U(4), M(5)
- All letters are allowed (M hasn't been ruled out)
- All constraints satisfied.

Therefore, the next logical guess is SERUM.
