### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should have frequently used letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word early on.

Another strong contender is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency coverage according to word game analysis.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word and in the correct position (✓) at index 3
- S and E are not in the word (x)

So the secret word has:
- O in the 3rd position
- A somewhere else (positions 2,4,5 since 1 and 3 are taken)
- No R, S, E

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, D, C, M, P
Good vowels to try next: I, U (since A and O are already known)

Let’s try a word with O in position 3, A somewhere else, and new consonants.  
A word like ""COATI"" would be good, but T and I are new.  
Another option is ""MANGO"" but G is less common.  
""PAINT"" has I, N, T – all new letters.  
""COBIA"" has C, B, I – but B is less common.  
""TONAL"" has T, N, L – all new consonants, and A in position 4.

I’ll go with ""TONAL"" because:
- O is in position 3 (matches feedback)
- A is in position 4 (new position for A)
- T, N, L are all new letters to test

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - O is in the word and in the correct position 3.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, S, E are not in the word.

2. TONAL → T(x) O(-) N(x) A(✓) L(-)
   - O is in the word but not in position 2 (we already knew it’s in position 3 from guess 1, so this confirms nothing new).
   - A is in the word and in the correct position 4.
   - T, N are not in the word.
   - L is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word has:
- _ _ O A _
- Contains L somewhere (positions 1, 2, or 3 are possible for L, but position 3 is already O, so positions 1 or 2).
- Does not contain R, S, E, T, N.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 3
- A in position 4
- L somewhere in positions 1 or 2
- No R, S, E, T, N

Possible patterns:
- L _ O A _
- _ L O A _

Let’s list some valid words fitting these patterns:
- LOA__ – no common 5-letter words fit this (LOAFS, LOAMY, etc. all contain R/S/E/T/N)
- _LOA_ – possible candidates: BLOOM (contains O twice, but second O is wrong position), CLOAK (contains C, L, O, A, K – no forbidden letters), DLOAS (invalid), FLOAS (invalid), GLOAM (contains G, L, O, A, M – no forbidden letters), etc.

CLOAK and GLOAM are both valid, but CLOAK uses C and K which are new letters to test. GLOAM uses G and M which are also new. Between these, CLOAK seems more common and uses C (a frequent consonant).

Let’s try CLOAK.
