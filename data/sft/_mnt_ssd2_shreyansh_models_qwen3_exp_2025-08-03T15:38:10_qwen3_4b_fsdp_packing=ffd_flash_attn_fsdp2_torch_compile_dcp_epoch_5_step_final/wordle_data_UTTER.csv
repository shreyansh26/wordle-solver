### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 unique common letters. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R (very common, often at start/end)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage of common letters and positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 unique common letters. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R (very common, often at start/end)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage of common letters and positions.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so R is not in position 1)
- A is not in the word
- I is not in the word
- S is not in the word
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so E is not in position 5)

So we know:
- The word contains R and E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively)
- The word does NOT contain A, I, or S

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and E
2. Does not contain A, I, or S
3. R is not in position 1
4. E is not in position 5

Good letters to try next: common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out (O, U, T, N, L, etc.)

Possible candidates: 
- TOWER (T, O, W, E, R) – E is in position 4, R in position 5 (satisfies constraints)
- ROUND (R in position 1 is invalid because R can't be in position 1)
- CRUEL (C, R, U, E, L) – R in position 2, E in position 4
- TROPE (T, R, O, P, E) – R in position 2, E in position 5 (invalid because E can't be in position 5)
- BROWN (B, R, O, W, N) – R in position 2, E missing
- TOWER seems valid: R in position 5 (allowed since R was in position 1 before), E in position 4

From all feedback so far we know:

- Positions 4 and 5 are fixed: E R
- Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, I, S, O, W, T, V, L  
- Therefore the first three letters must be chosen only from the remaining alphabet: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter English word that ends in “ER” and uses none of the banned letters.  
Let’s list common “_ _ E R” patterns with the remaining letters:

- B U E R → “BUER” – not a valid English word  
- C H E R → “CHER” – not a valid English word  
- C U E R → “CUER” – not a valid English word  
- D U E R → “DUER” – not a valid English word  
- F U E R → “FUER” – not a valid English word  
- G U E R → “GUER” – not a valid English word  
- H U E R → “HUER” – not a valid English word  
- N E V E R – but V is banned  
- N U E R → “NUER” – not a valid English word  
- P U E R → “PUER” – not a valid English word  
- M U E R → “MUER” – not a valid English word  
- C H E E R – but we only have one E allowed in position 4  
- D U D E R – but we only have one E allowed  
- B U N D E R – too long  
- C H E E R – already ruled out  
- P U N E R – but E is already used in position 4  

Wait, let’s step back systematically: we need a valid 5-letter English word ending in “ER” that contains no A, I, S, O, W, T, V, L.

Valid English 5-letter words ending in “ER” with only remaining letters:

- B U R E R – but that’s 5 letters ending in ER, and B, U, R, E, R – but we already know E is in position 4 and R in 5, so positions 1-3 must be B U R? That would make the word B U R E R, but that’s 5 letters total, positions 1-5: B U R E R. However, R is already in position 5, so this would duplicate R, which is allowed since letters can repeat unless ruled out. But we have no information against repeating R.

But BURER is a valid English word (a variant spelling of “bore” in Scots, or a term in heraldry). However, we need to check if any letters are excluded: B, U, R, E, R. None of A, I, S, O, W, T, V, L appear, so BURER is allowed.

But let me think of more common words:

- C H E E R – but we only have one E allowed (position 4), so this is invalid  
- N E V E R – V is banned  
- C U R E R – but we already have E in position 4, so this would be C U R E R – but that’s 5 letters, positions 1-5: C U R E R. This repeats R in positions 3 and 5, but that’s allowed. However, C U R E R is a valid English word (one who cures).

But we have no information against C or U or R or E or R. Let me check letters: C, U, R, E, R – none are in the banned list. So CURE R is allowed.

But I think the most straightforward word is “CURED” but that ends in ED, not ER. So we need ER.

Another candidate: “FURER” – but F, U, R, E, R – all allowed.

But the most common word seems to be “CURER” (one who cures).

However, let me check if there’s a more common word. The word “CHER” is 4 letters. “FURER” is obscure. “BURER” is obscure. “CURER” seems the best available.

But let me think again: the remaining letters are B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word ending in ER from these letters. The only common one seems to be CURER.

But let me check if there are others:

- D U R E R – “DURER” – not a standard word  
- F U R E R – “FUER” – not a standard word  
- G U R E R – “GUER” – not a standard word  
- H U R E R – “HUER” – not a standard word

- C H I E R – but I is banned  
- C H A E R – but A is banned  
- C H O E R – but O is banned  

It appears the only valid English word left is CURER.

But let me double-check: is there any other? “BURER” is valid in some dialects or Scrabble lists, but CURER is the most common.

Therefore, I will guess CURER.

<guess>CURER</guess>",CURER,"From all feedback so far we know:

- Positions 4 and 5 are fixed: E R
- Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, I, S, O, W, T, V, L  
- Therefore the first three letters must be chosen only from the remaining alphabet: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter English word that ends in “ER” and uses none of the banned letters.

Wait, let’s step back systematically: we need a valid 5-letter English word ending in “ER” that contains no A, I, S, O, W, T, V, L.

Valid English 5-letter words ending in “ER” with only remaining letters:

- B U R E R – but that’s 5 letters ending in ER, and B, U, R, E, R – but we already know E is in position 4 and R in 5, so positions 1-3 must be B U R? That would make the word B U R E R, but that’s 5 letters total, positions 1-5: B U R E R. However, R is already in position 5, so this would duplicate R, which is allowed since letters can repeat unless ruled out. But we have no information against repeating R.

But BURER is a valid English word (a variant spelling of “bore” in Scots, or a term in heraldry). However, we need to check if any letters are excluded: B, U, R, E, R. None of A, I, S, O, W, T, V, L appear, so BURER is allowed.

But let me think of more common words:

- N E V E R – V is banned  
- C U R E R – but we already have E in position 4, so this would be C U R E R – but that’s 5 letters, positions 1-5: C U R E R. This repeats R in positions 3 and 5, but that’s allowed. However, C U R E R is a valid English word (one who cures).

But we have no information against C or U or R or E or R. Let me check letters: C, U, R, E, R – none are in the banned list. So CURE R is allowed.

But I think the most straightforward word is “CURED” but that ends in ED, not ER. So we need ER.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 unique common letters. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""RAISE"". 

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- R (very common, often at start/end)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so R is not in position 1)
- A is not in the word
- I is not in the word
- S is not in the word
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 5, so E is not in position 5)

So we know:
- The word contains R and E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively)
- The word does NOT contain A, I, or S

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and E
2. Does not contain A, I, or S
3. R is not in position 1
4. E is not in position 5

Good letters to try next: common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out (O, U, T, N, L, etc.)

Possible candidates: 
- TOWER (T, O, W, E, R) – E is in position 4, R in position 5 (satisfies constraints)
- ROUND (R in position 1 is invalid because R can't be in position 1)
- CRUEL (C, R, U, E, L) – R in position 2, E in position 4
- TROPE (T, R, O, P, E) – R in position 2, E in position 5 (invalid because E can't be in position 5)
- BROWN (B, R, O, W, N) – R in position 2, E missing
- TOWER seems valid: R in position 5 (allowed since R was in position 1 before), E in position 4

Let's go with TOWER.

3. Additional constraints:
   - R cannot be in position 1 (from RAISE feedback)
   - E cannot be in position 5 (from RAISE feedback) — but we already have E locked into position 4, so this is satisfied
   - T is not in the word (from TOWER feedback), so any guess must avoid T

We need a 5-letter word that ends in ""ER"" (positions 4=E, 5=R) and does not contain A, I, S, O, W, T.

Possible letters left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

That would make the word B U R E R, but that’s 5 letters total, positions 1-5: B U R E R. However, R is already in position 5, so this would duplicate R, which is allowed since letters can repeat unless ruled out. But we have no information against repeating R.\n\nBut BURER is a valid English word (a variant spelling of “bore” in Scots, or a term in heraldry). However, we need to check if any letters are excluded: B, U, R, E, R. None of A, I, S, O, W, T, V, L appear, so BURER is allowed.\n\nBut let me think of more common words:\n\n- C H E E R – but we only have one E allowed (position 4), so this is invalid  \n- N E V E R – V is banned  \n- C U R E R – but we already have E in position 4, so this would be C U R E R – but that’s 5 letters, positions 1-5: C U R E R. This repeats R in positions 3 and 5, but that’s allowed. However, C U R E R is a valid English word (one who cures).\n\nBut we have no information against C or U or R or E or R. Let me check letters: C, U, R, E, R – none are in the banned list. So CURE R is allowed.\n\nBut I think the most straightforward word is “CURED” but that ends in ED, not ER. So we need ER.\n\nAnother candidate: “FURER” – but F, U, R, E, R – all allowed.\n\nBut the most common word seems to be “CURER” (one who cures).\n\nHowever, let me check if there’s a more common word. The word “CHER” is 4 letters. “FURER” is obscure. “BURER” is obscure. “CURER” seems the best available.\n\nBut let me think again: the remaining letters are B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need a valid 5-letter English word ending in ER from these letters.

From all five guesses we now know:

1. Fixed letters:
   - Position 4: E
   - Position 5: R

2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
   A, I, S, O, W, T, V, L, C

3. Additional positional information:
   - In CURER, U was in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2, so U is not in position 2).
   - R in CURER was in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so R is not in position 3).

4. Therefore the first three letters must be chosen from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, R, X, Y, Z (but R is already in position 5, so can appear only once).
   - U is somewhere in positions 1, 3 (since it can't be 2 or 4/5).

5. We need a 5-letter English word ending in ""ER"" with:
   - No A, I, S, O, W, T, V, L, C
   - U in position 1 or 3
   - R only in position 5
   - E only in position 4

Possible patterns:
- U _ _ E R (U in position 1)
- _ _ U E R (U in position 3)

Let's list valid words fitting these patterns:

U _ _ E R:
- U B E R → ""UBER"" (valid word, but rare)
- U D E R → ""UDER"" (not a word)
- U G E R → ""UGER"" (not a word)
- U N E R → ""UNER"" (not a word)
- U P E R → ""UPER"" (not a word)

_ _ U E R:
- B U N E R → ""BUNER"" (not a word)
- D U N E R → ""DUNER"" (valid word, variant of ""dune rider"")
- F U N E R → ""FUNER"" (not a word)
- G U N E R → ""GUNER"" (not a word)
- H U N E R → ""HUNER"" (not a word)
- M U N E R → ""MUNER"" (not a word)
- N U N E R → ""NUNER"" (not a word)
- P U N E R → ""PUNER"" (not a word)
- R U N E R → ""RUNER"" (not a word)
- Y U N E R → ""YUNER"" (not a word)

The only valid word left is ""DUNER"".

Check letters: D, U, N, E, R - none are in the banned list, and it fits all constraints.
