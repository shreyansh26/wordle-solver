### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The most common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U, and common consonants include R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover these letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices for this reason. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R somewhere (but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively).
- It does NOT contain O, S, or E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A and R.
2. Does NOT have O, S, or E.
3. Has A not in position 1 and R not in position 2.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Possible vowels left: A, I, U (since O and E are out).

Let me think of words with A and R that avoid O, S, E. Some candidates:
- TRAIN (but has I and N)
- GRAIN (but has I and N)
- BRAIN (but has I and N)
- CRANK (but has C, K)
- FRANK (but has F, K)
- TRAMP (but has M, P)
- RAVIN (but has I, N)
- RAPID (but has I, D)
- RATIO (but has O, which is invalid)
- RAVEN (but has E, which is invalid)
- RAPID (but has I, D)
- RAVEN (invalid E)
- RATIO (invalid O)
- RAVIN (has I, N)
- TRAIN (has I, N)

Looking at these, ""GRAIN"" seems good because:
- G, R, A, I, N
- Contains A and R
- No O, S, E
- A is in position 3 (not 1), R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2 - so this is invalid)

Wait, R in GRAIN is position 2, but feedback says R is not in position 2. So GRAIN is invalid.

Next candidate: ""CRANK""
- C, R, A, N, K
- Contains A and R
- No O, S, E
- A is in position 3 (valid), R is in position 2 (invalid - feedback says R is not in position 2)

Next: ""TRAIN""
- T, R, A, I, N

Next: ""RATIO"" - invalid (O)
""RAPID"" - has I, D
""RAPID"" - R is position 1 (valid), A is position 2 (valid), P, I, D
This seems valid:
- R is in position 1 (feedback only said R is not in position 2)

- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 1.

- P(x) → P is not in the word.
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- D(x) → D is not in the word.

Combining with the previous feedback:
- A is fixed in position 2.
- R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (from AROSE and RAPID).
- O, S, E, P, I, D are all absent.
- Remaining possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ _ with R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5, and no forbidden letters.

Possible consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, etc.
Possible vowels left: U (since A is used and O, E, I are out).

Let's think of words fitting _ A _ _ _ with R in 3/4/5 and no forbidden letters.
- BARON (but O is out)
- CARAT (but T and second A might be issues)
- FARMY (but Y is uncommon)
- GARTH (but H and T are okay)
- HARRY (but second R might be okay, but Y is okay)
- MARRY (but M, R, R, Y - but R is allowed twice)
- TARRY (but T, R, R, Y - R allowed twice)
- CARRY (but C, A, R, R, Y - R allowed twice)
- LARRY (but L, A, R, R, Y - R allowed twice)

Looking at these, ""CARRY"" seems good:
- C, A, R, R, Y
- A is in position 2 (correct)
- R appears twice (positions 3 and 4) - allowed
- No forbidden letters (O, S, E, P, I, D absent)
- Provides info on C, R (twice), Y

But ""CARRY"" has R in positions 3 and 4, which is acceptable since R must be in word but not positions 1 or 2.

Another option: ""MARRY"" - same structure.
But ""CARRY"" is more common.

Alternatively: ""TARRY"" - but T is okay, R twice, Y okay.

I'll go with ""CARRY"" as it tests C, Y and confirms R placement.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The most common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U, and common consonants include R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover these letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices for this reason. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R somewhere (but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively).
- It does NOT contain O, S, or E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A and R.
2. Does NOT have O, S, or E.
3. Has A not in position 1 and R not in position 2.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Possible vowels left: A, I, U (since O and E are out).

Let me think of words with A and R that avoid O, S, E. Some candidates:
- TRAIN (but has I and N)
- GRAIN (but has I and N)
- BRAIN (but has I and N)
- CRANK (but has C, K)
- FRANK (but has F, K)
- TRAMP (but has M, P)
- RAVIN (but has I, N)
- RAPID (but has I, D)
- RATIO (but has O, which is invalid)
- RAVEN (but has E, which is invalid)
- RAPID (but has I, D)
- RAVEN (invalid E)
- RATIO (invalid O)
- RAVIN (has I, N)
- TRAIN (has I, N)

Looking at these, ""GRAIN"" seems good because:
- G, R, A, I, N
- Contains A and R
- No O, S, E
- A is in position 3 (not 1), R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2 - so this is invalid)

Wait, R in GRAIN is position 2, but feedback says R is not in position 2. So GRAIN is invalid.

Next candidate: ""CRANK""
- C, R, A, N, K
- Contains A and R
- No O, S, E
- A is in position 3 (valid), R is in position 2 (invalid - feedback says R is not in position 2)

Next: ""TRAIN""
- T, R, A, I, N
- A is position 3, R is position 2 (invalid)

Next: ""RATIO"" - invalid (O)
""RAPID"" - has I, D
""RAPID"" - R is position 1 (valid), A is position 2 (valid), P, I, D
This seems valid:
- R is in position 1 (feedback only said R is not in position 2)
- A is in position 2 (feedback only said A is not in position 1)
- No O, S, E
- Contains A and R
- Other letters P, I, D are new and will provide information

So ""RAPID"" seems like a good next guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: RAPID -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) P(x) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on RAPID:
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A(✓) → A is in the word and in position 2 (fixed).
- P(x) → P is not in the word.
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- D(x) → D is not in the word.

Combining with the previous feedback:
- A is fixed in position 2.
- R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (from AROSE and RAPID).
- O, S, E, P, I, D are all absent.
- Remaining possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ _ with R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5, and no forbidden letters.

Possible consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, etc.
Possible vowels left: U (since A is used and O, E, I are out).

Let's think of words fitting _ A _ _ _ with R in 3/4/5 and no forbidden letters.
- BARON (but O is out)
- CARAT (but T and second A might be issues)
- FARMY (but Y is uncommon)
- GARTH (but H and T are okay)
- HARRY (but second R might be okay, but Y is okay)
- MARRY (but M, R, R, Y - but R is allowed twice)
- TARRY (but T, R, R, Y - R allowed twice)
- CARRY (but C, A, R, R, Y - R allowed twice)
- LARRY (but L, A, R, R, Y - R allowed twice)

Looking at these, ""CARRY"" seems good:
- C, A, R, R, Y
- A is in position 2 (correct)
- R appears twice (positions 3 and 4) - allowed
- No forbidden letters (O, S, E, P, I, D absent)
- Provides info on C, R (twice), Y

But ""CARRY"" has R in positions 3 and 4, which is acceptable since R must be in word but not positions 1 or 2.

Another option: ""MARRY"" - same structure.
But ""CARRY"" is more common.

Alternatively: ""TARRY"" - but T is okay, R twice, Y okay.

I'll go with ""CARRY"" as it tests C, Y and confirms R placement.

- R must appear exactly once (since the second R in CARRY was marked “-”, meaning R exists but not in position 4; therefore R is only in position 3).
- Forbidden letters so far: O, S, E, P, I, D, C, Y.
- Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- D(x) → D is not in the word.

Combining with the previous feedback:
- A is fixed in position 2.
- R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (from AROSE and RAPID).
- O, S, E, P, I, D are all absent.
- Remaining possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ _ with R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5, and no forbidden letters.

Possible consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, etc.
Possible vowels left: U (since A is used and O, E, I are out).

Let's think of words fitting _ A _ _ _ with R in 3/4/5 and no forbidden letters.
- BARON (but O is out)
- CARAT (but T and second A might be issues)
- FARMY (but Y is uncommon)
- GARTH (but H and T are okay)
- HARRY (but second R might be okay, but Y is okay)
- MARRY (but M, R, R, Y - but R is allowed twice)
- TARRY (but T, R, R, Y - R allowed twice)
- CARRY (but C, A, R, R, Y - R allowed twice)
- LARRY (but L, A, R, R, Y - R allowed twice)

Looking at these, ""CARRY"" seems good:
- C, A, R, R, Y
- A is in position 2 (correct)
- R appears twice (positions 3 and 4) - allowed
- No forbidden letters (O, S, E, P, I, D absent)
- Provides info on C, R (twice), Y

But ""CARRY"" has R in positions 3 and 4, which is acceptable since R must be in word but not positions 1 or 2.

Another option: ""MARRY"" - same structure.
But ""CARRY"" is more common.

Alternatively: ""TARRY"" - but T is okay, R twice, Y okay.

I'll go with ""CARRY"" as it tests C, Y and confirms R placement.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RAPID -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) P(x) I(x) D(x)
Guess 3: CARRY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on CARRY:
- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is confirmed in position 2.
- R(✓) → First R is in position 3 (correct).
- R(-) → Second R is in the word but not in position 4.
- Y(x) → Y is not in the word.

Combining all information:
- Word pattern: _ A R _ _
- R must appear exactly once (since the second R in CARRY was marked “-”, meaning R exists but not in position 4; therefore R is only in position 3).
- Forbidden letters so far: O, S, E, P, I, D, C, Y.
- Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ A R _ _ using only the allowed letters.

Possible first letters (positions 1 and 4): any of B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.
Possible fifth letters: same pool.

Let’s list some valid words:
- BARN_ → B A R N _ → BARN? (needs a fifth letter) → BARN? Doesn’t fit.
- FARM_ → F A R M _ → FARM? Doesn’t fit.
- GARN_ → G A R N _ → GARN? Doesn’t fit.
- HARK_ → H A R K _ → HARK? Doesn’t fit.
- MARRY → already excluded (Y).
- TARRY → excluded (Y).
- BARRY → excluded (Y).
- FARRY → excluded (Y).
- GARRY → excluded (Y).
- HARRY → excluded (Y).
- LARRY → excluded (Y).
- NARRY → not a word.
- TARRY → excluded (Y).

Wait, let’s think differently: the word must be _ A R _ _ with remaining letters allowed.

Valid English words:
- BRAWN (but W is allowed, N is allowed) → B A R W N → but is BRAWN valid? Yes, but does it fit? B A R W N → positions: B(1), A(2), R(3), W(4), N(5). This fits the pattern and uses allowed letters (B, W, N are allowed).

Another:
- BRAND → B A R N D → D is forbidden (from RAPID feedback).
- BARGE → G is allowed, E is forbidden.
- BARFS → S is forbidden.
- BARNS → S is forbidden.
- BAROT → O is forbidden.
- BARUM → M is allowed, U is allowed → BARUM is a word (a unit of pressure), but is it common? Maybe not.

Another candidate:
- FARMY → Y is forbidden.
- FARM? → Needs a fifth letter.

Let me check BRAWN:
- B, W, N are allowed (not in forbidden list).
- This seems valid.

Another:
- GRAFT → T is allowed, F is allowed → but A is in position 2, so GRAFT is G A R F T → fits _ A R _ _.

Between BRAWN and GRAFT, GRAFT seems more common.

Let’s verify:
- GRAFT: G, R, A, F, T.
- A is in position 2 (correct).
- R is in position 3 (correct).
- G, F, T are new letters to test.
- No forbidden letters.

Thus, GRAFT is a good next guess.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The most common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U, and common consonants include R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover these letters to help narrow down possibilities quickly. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices for this reason. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S).

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R somewhere (but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively).
- It does NOT contain O, S, or E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A and R.
2. Does NOT have O, S, or E.
3. Has A not in position 1 and R not in position 2.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Possible vowels left: A, I, U (since O and E are out).

Let me think of words with A and R that avoid O, S, E. Some candidates:
- TRAIN (but has I and N)
- GRAIN (but has I and N)
- BRAIN (but has I and N)
- CRANK (but has C, K)
- FRANK (but has F, K)
- TRAMP (but has M, P)
- RAVIN (but has I, N)
- RAPID (but has I, D)
- RATIO (but has O, which is invalid)
- RAVEN (but has E, which is invalid)
- RAPID (but has I, D)
- RAVEN (invalid E)
- RATIO (invalid O)
- RAVIN (has I, N)
- TRAIN (has I, N)

Looking at these, ""GRAIN"" seems good because:
- G, R, A, I, N
- Contains A and R
- No O, S, E
- A is in position 3 (not 1), R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in position 2 - so this is invalid)

Wait, R in GRAIN is position 2, but feedback says R is not in position 2. So GRAIN is invalid.

Next candidate: ""CRANK""
- C, R, A, N, K
- Contains A and R
- No O, S, E
- A is in position 3 (valid), R is in position 2 (invalid - feedback says R is not in position 2)

Next: ""TRAIN""
- T, R, A, I, N
- A is position 3, R is position 2 (invalid)

Next: ""RATIO"" - invalid (O)
""RAPID"" - has I, D
""RAPID"" - R is position 1 (valid), A is position 2 (valid), P, I, D
This seems valid:
- R is in position 1 (feedback only said R is not in position 2)
- A is in position 2 (feedback only said A is not in position 1)
- No O, S, E
- Contains A and R
- Other letters P, I, D are new and will provide information

So ""RAPID"" seems like a good next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RAPID -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) P(x) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on RAPID:
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A(✓) → A is in the word and in position 2 (fixed).
- P(x) → P is not in the word.
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- D(x) → D is not in the word.

Combining with the previous feedback:
- A is fixed in position 2.
- R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (from AROSE and RAPID).
- O, S, E, P, I, D are all absent.
- Remaining possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

So the pattern is: _ A _ _ _ with R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5, and no forbidden letters.

Possible consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, T, etc.
Possible vowels left: U (since A is used and O, E, I are out).

Let's think of words fitting _ A _ _ _ with R in 3/4/5 and no forbidden letters.
- BARON (but O is out)
- CARAT (but T and second A might be issues)
- FARMY (but Y is uncommon)
- GARTH (but H and T are okay)
- HARRY (but second R might be okay, but Y is okay)
- MARRY (but M, R, R, Y - but R is allowed twice)
- TARRY (but T, R, R, Y - R allowed twice)
- CARRY (but C, A, R, R, Y - R allowed twice)
- LARRY (but L, A, R, R, Y - R allowed twice)

Looking at these, ""CARRY"" seems good:
- C, A, R, R, Y
- A is in position 2 (correct)
- R appears twice (positions 3 and 4) - allowed
- No forbidden letters (O, S, E, P, I, D absent)
- Provides info on C, R (twice), Y

But ""CARRY"" has R in positions 3 and 4, which is acceptable since R must be in word but not positions 1 or 2.

Another option: ""MARRY"" - same structure.
But ""CARRY"" is more common.

Alternatively: ""TARRY"" - but T is okay, R twice, Y okay.

I'll go with ""CARRY"" as it tests C, Y and confirms R placement.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RAPID -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) P(x) I(x) D(x)
Guess 3: CARRY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on CARRY:
- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is confirmed in position 2.
- R(✓) → First R is in position 3 (correct).
- R(-) → Second R is in the word but not in position 4.
- Y(x) → Y is not in the word.

Combining all information:
- Word pattern: _ A R _ _
- R must appear exactly once (since the second R in CARRY was marked “-”, meaning R exists but not in position 4; therefore R is only in position 3).
- Forbidden letters so far: O, S, E, P, I, D, C, Y.
- Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ A R _ _ using only the allowed letters.

Possible first letters (positions 1 and 4): any of B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.
Possible fifth letters: same pool.

Let’s list some valid words:
- BARN_ → B A R N _ → BARN? (needs a fifth letter) → BARN? Doesn’t fit.
- FARM_ → F A R M _ → FARM? Doesn’t fit.
- GARN_ → G A R N _ → GARN? Doesn’t fit.
- HARK_ → H A R K _ → HARK? Doesn’t fit.
- MARRY → already excluded (Y).
- TARRY → excluded (Y).
- BARRY → excluded (Y).
- FARRY → excluded (Y).
- GARRY → excluded (Y).
- HARRY → excluded (Y).
- LARRY → excluded (Y).
- NARRY → not a word.
- TARRY → excluded (Y).

Wait, let’s think differently: the word must be _ A R _ _ with remaining letters allowed.

Valid English words:
- BRAWN (but W is allowed, N is allowed) → B A R W N → but is BRAWN valid? Yes, but does it fit? B A R W N → positions: B(1), A(2), R(3), W(4), N(5). This fits the pattern and uses allowed letters (B, W, N are allowed).

Another:
- BRAND → B A R N D → D is forbidden (from RAPID feedback).
- BARGE → G is allowed, E is forbidden.
- BARFS → S is forbidden.
- BARNS → S is forbidden.
- BAROT → O is forbidden.
- BARUM → M is allowed, U is allowed → BARUM is a word (a unit of pressure), but is it common? Maybe not.

Another candidate:
- FARMY → Y is forbidden.
- FARM? → Needs a fifth letter.

Let me check BRAWN:
- B, W, N are allowed (not in forbidden list).
- This seems valid.

Another:
- GRAFT → T is allowed, F is allowed → but A is in position 2, so GRAFT is G A R F T → fits _ A R _ _.

Between BRAWN and GRAFT, GRAFT seems more common.

Let’s verify:
- GRAFT: G, R, A, F, T.
- A is in position 2 (correct).
- R is in position 3 (correct).
- G, F, T are new letters to test.
- No forbidden letters.

Thus, GRAFT is a good next guess.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

1. Position 2 is A (✓ from RAPID and confirmed by CARRY).
2. Position 3 is R (✓ from CARRY).
3. Letters NOT in the word at all: O, S, E, P, I, D, C, Y, G, F, T.
4. Therefore the pattern is: _ A R _ _ and the remaining letters must come from the still-allowed set:
   B, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

5. The letter R appears exactly once (because the second R in CARRY was marked “-”, i.e., R exists but not in position 4; so R is only in position 3).

6. We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form _ A R _ _ using only the allowed letters.

Let’s list possible combinations:

- B A R _ _ : BARBS (B twice, S forbidden), BARNS (N allowed, S forbidden), BAROW (W allowed), BARON (O forbidden), BARKY (Y forbidden), BARRY (Y forbidden) → BAROW? Not a common word.
- H A R _ _ : HARDY (D forbidden), HARRY (Y forbidden), HARKY (Y forbidden), HARMS (S forbidden), HARRY (Y forbidden) → HARMS invalid.
- K A R _ _ : KARMA (M allowed, A twice) → KARMA is a word, but A is already fixed in position 2, so KARMA would have A in position 4, which conflicts.
- L A R _ _ : LARKS (S forbidden), LARNS (not a word), LARMA (A twice) → nothing valid.
- M A R _ _ : MARRY (Y forbidden), MARCH (C forbidden), MARMY (Y forbidden), MARCH (C forbidden) → nothing valid.
- N A R _ _ : NARWH (H allowed) → NARWH? Not common.
- Q A R _ _ : QARNS (S forbidden) → nothing.
- U A R _ _ : UARMS (not a word), UARKS (S forbidden) → nothing.
- V A R _ _ : VARKS (S forbidden) → nothing.
- W A R _ _ : WARM? Needs 5 letters → WARM_ → WARM? Doesn’t fit.
- X A R _ _ : XARMS (not a word) → nothing.
- Z A R _ _ : ZARMS (not a word) → nothing.

Hmm, none of these obvious combinations seem to work. Let me reconsider: perhaps I missed a word.

Wait – the word must be _ A R _ _ and use only the allowed letters. Let me think of actual English words:

- BRAWN (B, W, N allowed) → B A R W N → but is BRAWN of the form _ A R _ _? No, it’s B A R W N → positions: 1=B, 2=A, 3=R, 4=W, 5=N → this is _ A R _ _ exactly. And B, W, N are allowed. BRAWN is a valid word.

Let me check BRAWN against all constraints:
- Pattern: B A R W N → positions: 1=B, 2=A, 3=R, 4=W, 5=N.
- Forbidden letters: B, W, N are all in the allowed set (not in {O,S,E,P,I,D,C,Y,G,F,T}).
- R is only in position 3, which matches our deduction.
- A is in position 2 (correct).

Therefore BRAWN is a valid candidate.

Another candidate: M A R V N → but MARCH is invalid (C), MARMY (Y), etc. – nothing better.

Thus, the best next guess is BRAWN.

Let’s gather all the constraints we now have:

1. Position 2 is A (✓ from RAPID and confirmed by CARRY).
2. Position 3 is R (✓ from CARRY).
3. Letters NOT in the word at all: O, S, E, P, I, D, C, Y, G, F, T, B, W, N.
4. Therefore the pattern is: _ A R _ _ and the remaining letters must come from the still-allowed set:
   H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Z.

5. The letter R appears exactly once (because the second R in CARRY was marked “-”, i.e., R exists but not in position 4; so R is only in position 3).

6. We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form _ A R _ _ using only the allowed letters.

Wait, the pattern is _ A R _ _ and the remaining letters must be from H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Let me think of actual English words that fit:

- KARMA: but A is already in position 2, so the second A would be in position 4 – invalid.
- MARRY: Y forbidden.
- HARRY: Y forbidden.
- LARKS: S forbidden.
- HARDY: D forbidden.
- VAMPS: S forbidden, P forbidden.
- KARMA is the only word that comes to mind, but it has two A’s.

Actually, let me reconsider: the word must be _ A R _ _ with no O, S, E, P, I, D, C, Y, G, F, T, B, W, N.

The remaining letters are H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Possible words:
- HARKS: S forbidden.
- KARMA: A twice, but A is already in position 2 – would have A in position 4, which conflicts.
- MARCH: C forbidden.
- VAMPS: P forbidden, S forbidden.
- KARMA seems to be the closest, but it has two A’s.

Wait, the word could be KARMA, even though it has two A’s. The first A is in position 2 (correct), and the second A would be in position 4 – but we know from RAPID that A is in position 2 and that’s it (since A(-) in GRAFT means A exists but not in position 4). So KARMA is invalid because it has A in position 4.

This seems like a dead end. Let me check if I missed any letters.

Looking back at the forbidden list: O, S, E, P, I, D, C, Y, G, F, T, B, W, N.

Allowed letters: H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Is there any 5-letter English word _ A R _ _ using only these letters?

Let me think of:

- KARMA: invalid (second A).
- HARKS: S invalid.
- KARMA is the only word that comes close, but it’s invalid.

This suggests I might have made an error in tracking forbidden letters. Let me recompile:

Forbidden letters from all guesses:
- O, S, E (from AROSE)
- P, I, D (from RAPID)
- C, Y (from CARRY)
- G, F, T (from GRAFT)
- B, W, N (from BRAWN)

So forbidden: O, S, E, P, I, D, C, Y, G, F, T, B, W, N.

Allowed: H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Z.

The word must be _ A R _ _ with these letters.

Possible combinations:
- H A R K ? → HARK? Needs 5 letters → HARKS (S forbidden), HARKY (Y forbidden) → nothing.
- K A R M ? → KARMA (A twice) → invalid.
- M A R K ? → MARCH (C forbidden), MARRY (Y forbidden) → nothing.
- V A R K ? → VARKS (S forbidden) → nothing.
- H A R M ? → HARD? Needs 5 letters → HARDY (Y forbidden) → nothing.

This seems impossible. Did I misinterpret the feedback?

Re-reading the feedback:
- Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x) – A and R exist but not in positions 1/2, O/S/E absent.
- Guess 2: RAPID → R(-) A(✓) P(x) I(x) D(x) – A fixed in 2, R exists but not in 1, P/I/D absent.
- Guess 3: CARRY → C(x) A(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(x) – A fixed in 2, R fixed in 3, Y absent, C absent.
- Guess 4: GRAFT → G(x) R(-) A(-) F(x) T(x) – R not in 2 (but we know R is in 3), A exists but not in 3 (but A is in 2), G/F/T absent.
- Guess 5: BRAWN → B(x) R(-) A(-) W(x) N(x) – R not in 2 (already known), A exists but not in 3 (already known), B/W/N absent.

So far, the only constraints:
- Pattern: _ A R _ _
- Forbidden letters: O, S, E, P, I, D, C, Y, G, F, T, B, W, N.
- Allowed letters for positions 1, 4, 5: H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Z.

The word must be _ A R _ _ with these letters.

Possible English words:
- KARMA: invalid (second A).
- HARKS: S invalid.
- KARMA: invalid.
- HARKY: Y invalid.
- MARRY: Y invalid.
- VAMPS: P/S invalid.
- KARMA: invalid.

This seems like no valid English word fits. Did I miss any letters?

Wait, let me think of:
- H A R K ? → HARK? Needs 5 letters → HARKS (S invalid), HARKY (Y invalid) → nothing.
- K A R M ? → KARMA (A twice) → invalid.
- M A R K ? → MARCH (C invalid), MARRY (Y invalid) → nothing.
- V A R K ? → VARKS (S invalid) → nothing.
- H A R M ? → HARDY (Y invalid) → nothing.

This is perplexing. It appears there is no valid English word fitting _ A R _ _ with the remaining allowed letters. This suggests I might have made an error in tracking allowed letters.

Let me recompile the allowed letters more carefully:

From all guesses, the absent letters are:
O, S, E, P, I, D, C, Y, G, F, T, B, W, N.

Thus, allowed letters are:
H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Z.

The word must be _ A R _ _ with these letters.

Possible combinations:
- H A R K ? → HARK? Needs 5 letters → HARKS (S invalid), HARKY (Y invalid) → nothing.
- K A R M ? → KARMA (A twice) → invalid.
- M A R K ? → MARCH (C invalid), MARRY (Y invalid) → nothing.
- V A R K ? → VARKS (S invalid) → nothing.
- H A R M ? → HARDY (Y invalid) → nothing.

This seems impossible. Did I misinterpret the feedback?

Re-examining the feedback:
- Guess 5: BRAWN → B(x) R(-) A(-) W(x) N(x)
  - R(-) means R exists but not in position 2 (already known).
  - A(-) means A exists but not in position 3 (already known, since A is in 2).

Thus, the only constraints are:
- Pattern: _ A R _ _
- Forbidden letters: O, S, E, P, I, D, C, Y, G, F, T, B, W, N.
- Allowed letters: H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Z.

The word must be _ A R _ _ with these letters.

Possible English words:
- KARMA: invalid (second A).
- HARKS: S invalid.
- MARCH: C invalid.
- VAMPS: P/S invalid.

This seems like no valid word exists. This suggests an inconsistency, likely due to an error in tracking allowed letters.

Upon closer inspection, the letter A is fixed in position 2, R in position 3, and the rest must be from the allowed set. The word ""KARMA"" is invalid because it has two A's. The only remaining possibility is ""KARMA"" itself, but it's invalid.

This indicates that the word must be ""KARMA"" despite the double A, but that contradicts our constraints. Therefore, I must have missed a word.

After careful reconsideration, the word must be ""KARMA"" even with the double A, as it's the only plausible word fitting the pattern _ A R _ _ with remaining letters, even though it has an extra A. This suggests the word might indeed be KARMA.

However, this seems unlikely. Let me check one last time:

Possible valid word: KARMA (K, A, R, M, A) – but A is already in position 2, so position 4 would have A, which is allowed as long as A is not marked as absent. From all feedback, A is only marked as (-) in GRAFT (meaning A exists but not in position 4). Thus, A can appear twice.

Therefore, KARMA is actually valid despite the double A.

So the next guess is KARMA.
</think>

After carefully re-evaluating the constraints, the only remaining valid word that fits the pattern _ A R _ _ and uses only the still-allowed letters is **KARMA** (even though it contains two A's, the feedback only indicated A exists but not in position 4, so a second A in position 4 is allowed).

<guess>KARMA</guess>",KARMA,"Let’s gather all the constraints we now have:

1. Position 2 is A (✓ from RAPID and confirmed by CARRY).
2. Position 3 is R (✓ from CARRY).
3. Letters NOT in the word at all: O, S, E, P, I, D, C, Y, G, F, T, B, W, N.
4. Therefore the pattern is: _ A R _ _ and the remaining letters must come from the still-allowed set:
   H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Z.

5. The letter R appears exactly once (because the second R in CARRY was marked “-”, i.e., R exists but not in position 4; so R is only in position 3).

6. We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form _ A R _ _ using only the allowed letters.

Let’s list possible combinations:

- H A R _ _ : HARDY (D forbidden), HARRY (Y forbidden), HARKY (Y forbidden), HARMS (S forbidden), HARKS (S forbidden) → nothing.
- J A R _ _ : JARDO (O forbidden), JARNS (not a word) → nothing.
- K A R _ _ : KARMA (A twice, M allowed) → KARMA has A in position 4, which conflicts with A in position 2.
- L A R _ _ : LARKS (S forbidden), LARNS (not a word) → nothing.
- M A R _ _ : MARCH (C forbidden), MARMY (Y forbidden), MARRY (Y forbidden) → nothing.
- Q A R _ _ : QARNS (S forbidden) → nothing.
- U A R _ _ : UARMS (not a word), UARKS (S forbidden) → nothing.
- V A R _ _ : VARKS (S forbidden) → nothing.
- X A R _ _ : XARMS (not a word) → nothing.
- Z A R _ _ : ZARMS (not a word) → nothing.
