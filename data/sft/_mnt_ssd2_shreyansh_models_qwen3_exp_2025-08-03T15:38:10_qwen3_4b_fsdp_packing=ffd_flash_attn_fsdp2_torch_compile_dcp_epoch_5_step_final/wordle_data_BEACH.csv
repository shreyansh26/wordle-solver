For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities early on. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and common consonants. This will give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong candidate is ""STARE"" (S, T, A, R, E), but ""AROSE"" has slightly better letter coverage according to frequency analysis. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a good mix of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

Let me think of words with A and E that don’t use R, O, or S:
- ""LEAPT"" – uses L, E, A, P, T; no R, O, S. A is 3rd, E is 2nd – both positions are allowed.
- ""PLATE"" – P, L, A, T, E; no R, O, S. A is 3rd, E is 5th – but E can’t be 5th, so this is invalid.
- ""TALON"" – has O, which is invalid.
- ""CLEAN"" – C, L, E, A, N; no R, O, S. A is 4th, E is 3rd – both positions allowed. This seems good.

   - L and N are eliminated.
   - C is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
   - E and A are still in the word but still in wrong positions.

Summary of what we know:
- Letters that must appear: A, E, C
- Letters that are out: R, O, S, L, N
- Position constraints:
  - A cannot be 1st (from arose) or 4th (from clean)
  - E cannot be 5th (from arose) or 3rd (from clean)
  - C cannot be 1st (from clean)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, E, C
- Does not contain R, O, S, L, N
- A is not in position 1 or 4
- E is not in position 3 or 5
- C is not in position 1

Remaining common letters to try: T, D, M, P, B, G, H, I, U, Y, etc.

Let’s brainstorm possible positions for A, E, C:

A can be 2, 3, or 5
E can be 1, 2, 4
C can be 2, 3, 4, 5 (but not 1)

Let’s try to place them:

Option 1: C in position 2
   C _ A E _  → but E would be 4th, which is allowed.
   Word: C _ A E _ → need two more letters that are not R, O, S, L, N.

Option 2: C in position 3
   _ C A E _  → E would be 4th, allowed.
   Or _ C _ A E → E is 5th, which is not allowed (E cannot be 5th).

Option 3: C in position 4
   _ _ A C E → E is 5th, not allowed.
   Or _ E A C _ → E is 2nd, allowed.

Option 4: C in position 5
   _ _ A E C → A is 3rd, E is 4th, both allowed.

Let’s explore Option 4: _ _ A E C
We need two letters for positions 1 and 2, not R, O, S, L, N, and not A, E, C (since each appears only once so far).
Good candidates: T, D, M, P, B, G, H, I, U, Y, etc.

Possible combinations:
- T and D → T D A E C → ""tdaec"" – not a valid word.
- T and I → T I A E C → ""tiaec"" – invalid.
- M and A → but A is already used.
- P and A → same issue.
- B and A → same.
- H and A → same.

Let’s try Option 3: _ _ A C E
Need two letters for positions 1 and 2, not R, O, S, L, N, and not A, E, C.
Possible valid words:
- D A A C E – invalid (double A).
- D I A C E – ""diace"" – invalid.
- B A A C E – invalid.
- G A A C E – invalid.
- T A A C E – invalid.
- M A A C E – invalid.

Let’s try Option 2: _ C A E _
Need two letters for positions 1 and 5, not R, O, S, L, N, and not A, E, C.
Possible:
- D C A E T → ""dcaet"" – invalid.
- B C A E T → ""bcaet"" – invalid.
- T C A E D → ""tcaed"" – invalid.
- P C A E D → ""pcaed"" – invalid.

Let’s try Option 1: C _ A E _
Need two letters for positions 2 and 5, not R, O, S, L, N, and not A, E, C.
Possible:
- C H A E D → ""chaed"" – invalid.
- C H A E T → ""chaet"" – invalid.
- C I A E T → ""ciaet"" – invalid.
- C O A E T – but O is eliminated.
- C U A E T → ""cuAET"" – invalid.

Let’s try a different approach: look for actual words that contain A, E, C without R, O, S, L, N.

Possible words:
- ""CACHE"" – has C, A, C, H, E – but C is repeated, and we don’t know if duplicates are allowed.
- ""CEASE"" – has C, E, A, S, E – but S is eliminated.
- ""CAGED"" – has C, A, G, E, D – this seems valid:
   - Letters: C, A, G, E, D – none of R, O, S, L, N.
   - Positions:
      - C is 1st – but C cannot be 1st (from clean feedback).
   So ""caged"" is invalid.

- ""CADET"" – C, A, D, E, T – positions:
   - C is 1st – invalid (cannot be 1st).
- ""CATER"" – has R, invalid.
- ""CAGED"" – already saw C is 1st, invalid.
- ""CADET"" – same issue with C being 1st.

Let’s try ""EACID"" – but this is not a valid word.

Let’s try ""PEACH"" – has P, E, A, C, H – positions:
   - C is 4th – allowed (C can be 4th).
   - A is 3rd – allowed (A can be 3rd).
   - E is 2nd – allowed (E can be 2nd).
   - Letters: P, E, A, C, H – none of R, O, S, L, N.
   This seems valid.

Check constraints:
- Must contain A, E, C – yes.
- Does not contain R, O, S, L, N – yes.
- A is 3rd (allowed, not 1st or 4th) – yes.
- E is 2nd (allowed, not 3rd or 5th) – yes.
- C is 4th (allowed, not 1st) – yes.

""peach"" is a valid English word.

So my next guess is ""peach"".

Remaining common letters to try: T, D, M, P, B, G, H, I, U, Y, etc.

Let’s brainstorm possible positions for A, E, C:

A can be 2, 3, or 5
E can be 1, 2, 4
C can be 2, 3, 4, 5 (but not 1)

Let’s try to place them:

Option 1: C in position 2
   C _ A E _  → but E would be 4th, which is allowed.
   Word: C _ A E _ → need two more letters that are not R, O, S, L, N.

Option 2: C in position 3
   _ C A E _  → E would be 4th, allowed.
   Or _ C _ A E → E is 5th, which is not allowed (E cannot be 5th).

Option 3: C in position 4
   _ _ A C E → E is 5th, not allowed.
   Or _ E A C _ → E is 2nd, allowed.

Option 4: C in position 5
   _ _ A E C → A is 3rd, E is 4th, both allowed.

Let’s explore Option 4: _ _ A E C
We need two letters for positions 1 and 2, not R, O, S, L, N, and not A, E, C (since each appears only once so far).
Good candidates: T, D, M, P, B, G, H, I, U, Y, etc.

Possible combinations:
- T and D → T D A E C → ""tdaec"" – not a valid word.
- T and I → T I A E C → ""tiaec"" – invalid.
- M and A → but A is already used.
- P and A → same issue.
- B and A → same.
- H and A → same.

Let’s try Option 3: _ _ A C E
Need two letters for positions 1 and 2, not R, O, S, L, N, and not A, E, C.
Possible valid words:
- D A A C E – invalid (double A).
- D I A C E – ""diace"" – invalid.
- B A A C E – invalid.
- G A A C E – invalid.
- T A A C E – invalid.
- M A A C E – invalid.

Let’s try Option 2: _ C A E _
Need two letters for positions 1 and 5, not R, O, S, L, N, and not A, E, C.
Possible:
- D C A E T → ""dcaet"" – invalid.
- B C A E T → ""bcaet"" – invalid.
- T C A E D → ""tcaed"" – invalid.
- P C A E D → ""pcaed"" – invalid.

Let’s try Option 1: C _ A E _
Need two letters for positions 2 and 5, not R, O, S, L, N, and not A, E, C.
Possible:
- C H A E D → ""chaed"" – invalid.
- C H A E T → ""chaet"" – invalid.
- C I A E T → ""ciaet"" – invalid.
- C O A E T – but O is eliminated.
- C U A E T → ""cuAET"" – invalid.

Let’s try a different approach: look for actual words that contain A, E, C without R, O, S, L, N.

Possible words:
- ""CACHE"" – has C, A, C, H, E – but C is repeated, and we don’t know if duplicates are allowed.
- ""CEASE"" – has C, E, A, S, E – but S is eliminated.
- ""CAGED"" – has C, A, G, E, D – this seems valid:
   - Letters: C, A, G, E, D – none of R, O, S, L, N.
   - Positions:
      - C is 1st – but C cannot be 1st (from clean feedback).
   So ""caged"" is invalid.

- ""CADET"" – C, A, D, E, T – positions:
   - C is 1st – invalid (cannot be 1st).
- ""CATER"" – has R, invalid.
- ""CAGED"" – already saw C is 1st, invalid.
- ""CADET"" – same issue with C being 1st.

Let’s try ""EACID"" – but this is not a valid word.

Let’s try ""PEACH"" – has P, E, A, C, H – positions:
   - C is 4th – allowed (C can be 4th).
   - A is 3rd – allowed (A can be 3rd).
   - E is 2nd – allowed (E can be 2nd).
   - Letters: P, E, A, C, H – none of R, O, S, L, N.
   This seems valid.

Check constraints:
- Must contain A, E, C – yes.
- Does not contain R, O, S, L, N – yes.
- A is 3rd (allowed, not 1st or 4th) – yes.
- E is 2nd (allowed, not 3rd or 5th) – yes.
- C is 4th (allowed, not 1st) – yes.

""peach"" is a valid English word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities early on. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and common consonants. This will give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong candidate is ""STARE"" (S, T, A, R, E), but ""AROSE"" has slightly better letter coverage according to frequency analysis. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a good mix of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(x): R is NOT in the word.
- O(x): O is NOT in the word.
- S(x): S is NOT in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but in the wrong position (not 5th).

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: R, O, S
- Letters that must appear somewhere: A, E
- Positions to avoid for A: 1st
- Positions to avoid for E: 5th

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and E
- Does NOT contain R, O, or S
- Has A not in position 1
- Has E not in position 5

Good candidate letters left: A, E, plus common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

Let me think of words with A and E that don’t use R, O, or S:
- ""LEAPT"" – uses L, E, A, P, T; no R, O, S. A is 3rd, E is 2nd – both positions are allowed.
- ""PLATE"" – P, L, A, T, E; no R, O, S. A is 3rd, E is 5th – but E can’t be 5th, so this is invalid.
- ""TALON"" – has O, which is invalid.
- ""CLEAN"" – C, L, E, A, N; no R, O, S. A is 4th, E is 3rd – both positions allowed. This seems good.

Between ""LEAPT"" and ""CLEAN"":
- LEAPT: L, E, A, P, T – positions: A(3), E(2)
- CLEAN: C, L, E, A, N – positions: A(4), E(3)

Both are valid, but ""CLEAN"" uses C which is a good consonant and gives more coverage. I'll go with CLEAN.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: clean -> FEEDBACK: C(-) L(x) E(-) A(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - R, O, S are eliminated.
   - A and E are in the word but in wrong positions.

2. clean → C(-) L(x) E(-) A(-) N(x)
   - L and N are eliminated.
   - C is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
   - E and A are still in the word but still in wrong positions.

Summary of what we know:
- Letters that must appear: A, E, C
- Letters that are out: R, O, S, L, N
- Position constraints:
  - A cannot be 1st (from arose) or 4th (from clean)
  - E cannot be 5th (from arose) or 3rd (from clean)
  - C cannot be 1st (from clean)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, E, C
- Does not contain R, O, S, L, N
- A is not in position 1 or 4
- E is not in position 3 or 5
- C is not in position 1

Remaining common letters to try: T, D, M, P, B, G, H, I, U, Y, etc.

Let’s brainstorm possible positions for A, E, C:

A can be 2, 3, or 5
E can be 1, 2, 4
C can be 2, 3, 4, 5 (but not 1)

Let’s try to place them:

   Word: C _ A E _ → need two more letters that are not R, O, S, L, N.

Option 2: C in position 3
   _ C A E _  → E would be 4th, allowed.
   Or _ C _ A E → E is 5th, which is not allowed (E cannot be 5th).

Option 3: C in position 4
   _ _ A C E → E is 5th, not allowed.
   Or _ E A C _ → E is 2nd, allowed.

Option 4: C in position 5
   _ _ A E C → A is 3rd, E is 4th, both allowed.

Let’s explore Option 4: _ _ A E C
We need two letters for positions 1 and 2, not R, O, S, L, N, and not A, E, C (since each appears only once so far).
Good candidates: T, D, M, P, B, G, H, I, U, Y, etc.

Possible combinations:
- T and D → T D A E C → ""tdaec"" – not a valid word.
- T and I → T I A E C → ""tiaec"" – invalid.

- P and A → same issue.

- B C A E T → ""bcaet"" – invalid.
- T C A E D → ""tcaed"" – invalid.
- P C A E D → ""pcaed"" – invalid.

Let’s try Option 1: C _ A E _
Need two letters for positions 2 and 5, not R, O, S, L, N, and not A, E, C.
Possible:
- C H A E D → ""chaed"" – invalid.
- C H A E T → ""chaet"" – invalid.
- C I A E T → ""ciaet"" – invalid.

- ""CATER"" – has R, invalid.
- ""CAGED"" – already saw C is 1st, invalid.

Let’s try ""EACID"" – but this is not a valid word.

Let’s try ""PEACH"" – has P, E, A, C, H – positions:
   - C is 4th – allowed (C can be 4th).
   - A is 3rd – allowed (A can be 3rd).
   - E is 2nd – allowed (E can be 2nd).
   - Letters: P, E, A, C, H – none of R, O, S, L, N.

- Position 5: H
- Position 1: unknown, but must not be R, O, S, L, N, P.

Letters still allowed for position 1: any letter not in {R, O, S, L, N, P} and not already used (A, E, C, H).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities early on. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and common consonants. This will give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong candidate is ""STARE"" (S, T, A, R, E), but ""AROSE"" has slightly better letter coverage according to frequency analysis. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a good mix of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in 5-letter words.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(x): R is NOT in the word.
- O(x): O is NOT in the word.
- S(x): S is NOT in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but in the wrong position (not 5th).

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: R, O, S
- Letters that must appear somewhere: A, E
- Positions to avoid for A: 1st
- Positions to avoid for E: 5th

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and E
- Does NOT contain R, O, or S
- Has A not in position 1
- Has E not in position 5

Good candidate letters left: A, E, plus common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.

Let me think of words with A and E that don’t use R, O, or S:
- ""LEAPT"" – uses L, E, A, P, T; no R, O, S. A is 3rd, E is 2nd – both positions are allowed.
- ""PLATE"" – P, L, A, T, E; no R, O, S. A is 3rd, E is 5th – but E can’t be 5th, so this is invalid.
- ""TALON"" – has O, which is invalid.
- ""CLEAN"" – C, L, E, A, N; no R, O, S. A is 4th, E is 3rd – both positions allowed. This seems good.

Between ""LEAPT"" and ""CLEAN"":
- LEAPT: L, E, A, P, T – positions: A(3), E(2)
- CLEAN: C, L, E, A, N – positions: A(4), E(3)

Both are valid, but ""CLEAN"" uses C which is a good consonant and gives more coverage. I'll go with CLEAN.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: clean -> FEEDBACK: C(-) L(x) E(-) A(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - R, O, S are eliminated.
   - A and E are in the word but in wrong positions.

2. clean → C(-) L(x) E(-) A(-) N(x)
   - L and N are eliminated.
   - C is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
   - E and A are still in the word but still in wrong positions.

Summary of what we know:
- Letters that must appear: A, E, C
- Letters that are out: R, O, S, L, N
- Position constraints:
  - A cannot be 1st (from arose) or 4th (from clean)
  - E cannot be 5th (from arose) or 3rd (from clean)
  - C cannot be 1st (from clean)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, E, C
- Does not contain R, O, S, L, N
- A is not in position 1 or 4
- E is not in position 3 or 5
- C is not in position 1

Remaining common letters to try: T, D, M, P, B, G, H, I, U, Y, etc.

Let’s brainstorm possible positions for A, E, C:

A can be 2, 3, or 5
E can be 1, 2, 4
C can be 2, 3, 4, 5 (but not 1)

Let’s try to place them:

Option 1: C in position 2
   C _ A E _  → but E would be 4th, which is allowed.
   Word: C _ A E _ → need two more letters that are not R, O, S, L, N.

Option 2: C in position 3
   _ C A E _  → E would be 4th, allowed.
   Or _ C _ A E → E is 5th, which is not allowed (E cannot be 5th).

Option 3: C in position 4
   _ _ A C E → E is 5th, not allowed.
   Or _ E A C _ → E is 2nd, allowed.

Option 4: C in position 5
   _ _ A E C → A is 3rd, E is 4th, both allowed.

Let’s explore Option 4: _ _ A E C
We need two letters for positions 1 and 2, not R, O, S, L, N, and not A, E, C (since each appears only once so far).
Good candidates: T, D, M, P, B, G, H, I, U, Y, etc.

Possible combinations:
- T and D → T D A E C → ""tdaec"" – not a valid word.
- T and I → T I A E C → ""tiaec"" – invalid.
- M and A → but A is already used.
- P and A → same issue.
- B and A → same.
- H and A → same.

Let’s try Option 3: _ _ A C E
Need two letters for positions 1 and 2, not R, O, S, L, N, and not A, E, C.
Possible valid words:
- D A A C E – invalid (double A).
- D I A C E – ""diace"" – invalid.
- B A A C E – invalid.
- G A A C E – invalid.
- T A A C E – invalid.
- M A A C E – invalid.

Let’s try Option 2: _ C A E _
Need two letters for positions 1 and 5, not R, O, S, L, N, and not A, E, C.
Possible:
- D C A E T → ""dcaet"" – invalid.
- B C A E T → ""bcaet"" – invalid.
- T C A E D → ""tcaed"" – invalid.
- P C A E D → ""pcaed"" – invalid.

Let’s try Option 1: C _ A E _
Need two letters for positions 2 and 5, not R, O, S, L, N, and not A, E, C.
Possible:
- C H A E D → ""chaed"" – invalid.
- C H A E T → ""chaet"" – invalid.
- C I A E T → ""ciaet"" – invalid.
- C O A E T – but O is eliminated.
- C U A E T → ""cuAET"" – invalid.

Let’s try a different approach: look for actual words that contain A, E, C without R, O, S, L, N.

Possible words:
- ""CACHE"" – has C, A, C, H, E – but C is repeated, and we don’t know if duplicates are allowed.
- ""CEASE"" – has C, E, A, S, E – but S is eliminated.
- ""CAGED"" – has C, A, G, E, D – this seems valid:
   - Letters: C, A, G, E, D – none of R, O, S, L, N.
   - Positions:
      - C is 1st – but C cannot be 1st (from clean feedback).
   So ""caged"" is invalid.

- ""CADET"" – C, A, D, E, T – positions:
   - C is 1st – invalid (cannot be 1st).
- ""CATER"" – has R, invalid.
- ""CAGED"" – already saw C is 1st, invalid.
- ""CADET"" – same issue with C being 1st.

Let’s try ""EACID"" – but this is not a valid word.

Let’s try ""PEACH"" – has P, E, A, C, H – positions:
   - C is 4th – allowed (C can be 4th).
   - A is 3rd – allowed (A can be 3rd).
   - E is 2nd – allowed (E can be 2nd).
   - Letters: P, E, A, C, H – none of R, O, S, L, N.
   This seems valid.

Check constraints:
- Must contain A, E, C – yes.
- Does not contain R, O, S, L, N – yes.
- A is 3rd (allowed, not 1st or 4th) – yes.
- E is 2nd (allowed, not 3rd or 5th) – yes.
- C is 4th (allowed, not 1st) – yes.

""peach"" is a valid English word.

So my next guess is ""peach"".
