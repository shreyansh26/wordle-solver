For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize the chance of getting hits. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and common consonants. This will give us good information about which of these key letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1
- R is not in the word at all
- O is correct in position 3
- S is not in the word at all
- E is correct in position 5

So the pattern so far is: A _ O _ E

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with A
2. Has O in the 3rd position
3. Ends with E
4. Does NOT contain R or S

Possible letters for positions 2 and 4: any consonant or vowel except R and S.

Let me think of words that fit A _ O _ E:
- ABOLE (but ""able"" is 4 letters, so not valid)
- ACORE (but has R, which is invalid)
- AGONE (valid word, means to move away)
- AMBLE (but has S in it? No, AMBLE has B and L)
- ANGEL (but has S? No, ANGEL has N, G, E, L)
- ADOBE (but has B and D)
- AFOGE (but G and F are possible)
- ADOGE (but G and D are possible)

Looking at common words, ""AGONE"" seems good - it fits A _ O _ E and doesn't use R or S. Let me verify:
- A(✓) G(?) O(✓) N(?) E(✓)

This will test G and N in positions 2 and 4. Alternatively, ""AMBLE"" would test M and B, but ""AGONE"" seems more straightforward.

Another option is ""ACORN"" but it has R which is invalid. ""ACUTE"" has U in position 2 and T in position 4, but it's A C O U T E - but that's 6 letters. 

""ACOEE"" is invalid. ""ABODE"" has B and D. 

""AGONE"" seems the best next guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the two previous guesses we know:

1. The word is of the form A _ O _ E (positions 1, 3, 5 are fixed as A-O-E).
2. Letters that have been ruled out entirely: R, S, G, N.
3. Letters still possible for positions 2 and 4: any consonant or vowel except R, S, G, N.

Let’s list the remaining alphabet letters (excluding R, S, G, N):
A, B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two distinct letters from this set to fill positions 2 and 4.  
The vowels I and U are still available, as are consonants like B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, T, etc.

Common 5-letter patterns A _ O _ E:
- A B O _ E → ABOLE (invalid, 4 letters)
- A C O _ E → ACORE (contains R, invalid)
- A C O U E → AC O U E (invalid, 5 letters but not a word)
- A C O D E → ACODE (valid word)
- A C O M E → ACOME (valid word)
- A C O V E → ACOVE (valid word)
- A D O B E → ADOBE (valid word)
- A D O M E → ADM OE (invalid)
- A D O M E → ADM OE (invalid)
- A L O N E → ALONE (invalid, N is ruled out)
- A L O D E → ALODE (invalid)
- A M O D E → AMODE (invalid)
- A M O R E → AMORE (invalid, R is ruled out)
- A M O C E → AMOCE (invalid)
- A T O N E → ATONE (invalid, N is ruled out)
- A T O M E → ATOME (invalid)
- A T O D E → ATODE (invalid)
- A T O L E → ATOLE (valid word)
- A C O D E, A C O M E, A D O B E, A T O L E all fit.

Among these, ""ACODE"" and ""ADOBE"" are both common. ""ACODE"" is more technical, while ""ADOBE"" is a well-known word. Let’s choose ""ADOBE"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize the chance of getting hits. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and common consonants. This will give us good information about which of these key letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1
- R is not in the word at all
- O is correct in position 3
- S is not in the word at all
- E is correct in position 5

So the pattern so far is: A _ O _ E

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with A
2. Has O in the 3rd position
3. Ends with E
4. Does NOT contain R or S

Possible letters for positions 2 and 4: any consonant or vowel except R and S.

Let me think of words that fit A _ O _ E:
- ABOLE (but ""able"" is 4 letters, so not valid)
- ACORE (but has R, which is invalid)
- AGONE (valid word, means to move away)
- AMBLE (but has S in it? No, AMBLE has B and L)
- ANGEL (but has S? No, ANGEL has N, G, E, L)
- ADOBE (but has B and D)
- AFOGE (but G and F are possible)
- ADOGE (but G and D are possible)

Looking at common words, ""AGONE"" seems good - it fits A _ O _ E and doesn't use R or S. Let me verify:
- A(✓) G(?) O(✓) N(?) E(✓)

This will test G and N in positions 2 and 4. Alternatively, ""AMBLE"" would test M and B, but ""AGONE"" seems more straightforward.

Another option is ""ACORN"" but it has R which is invalid. ""ACUTE"" has U in position 2 and T in position 4, but it's A C O U T E - but that's 6 letters. 

""ACOEE"" is invalid. ""ABODE"" has B and D.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize the chance of getting hits. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and common consonants. This will give us good information about which of these key letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1
- R is not in the word at all
- O is correct in position 3
- S is not in the word at all
- E is correct in position 5

So the pattern so far is: A _ O _ E

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with A
2. Has O in the 3rd position
3. Ends with E
4. Does NOT contain R or S

Possible letters for positions 2 and 4: any consonant or vowel except R and S.

Let me think of words that fit A _ O _ E:
- ABOLE (but ""able"" is 4 letters, so not valid)
- ACORE (but has R, which is invalid)
- AGONE (valid word, means to move away)
- AMBLE (but has S in it? No, AMBLE has B and L)
- ANGEL (but has S? No, ANGEL has N, G, E, L)
- ADOBE (but has B and D)
- AFOGE (but G and F are possible)
- ADOGE (but G and D are possible)

Looking at common words, ""AGONE"" seems good - it fits A _ O _ E and doesn't use R or S. Let me verify:
- A(✓) G(?) O(✓) N(?) E(✓)

This will test G and N in positions 2 and 4. Alternatively, ""AMBLE"" would test M and B, but ""AGONE"" seems more straightforward.

Another option is ""ACORN"" but it has R which is invalid. ""ACUTE"" has U in position 2 and T in position 4, but it's A C O U T E - but that's 6 letters. 

""ACOEE"" is invalid. ""ABODE"" has B and D. 

""AGONE"" seems the best next guess.

From the two previous guesses we know:

1. The word is of the form A _ O _ E (positions 1, 3, 5 are fixed as A-O-E).
2. Letters that have been ruled out entirely: R, S, G, N.
3. Letters still possible for positions 2 and 4: any consonant or vowel except R, S, G, N.

Let’s list the remaining alphabet letters (excluding R, S, G, N):
A, B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two distinct letters from this set to fill positions 2 and 4.  
The vowels I and U are still available, as are consonants like B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, T, etc.

Common 5-letter patterns A _ O _ E:
- A B O _ E → ABOLE (invalid, 4 letters)
- A C O _ E → ACORE (contains R, invalid)
- A C O U E → AC O U E (invalid, 5 letters but not a word)
- A C O D E → ACODE (valid word)
- A C O M E → ACOME (valid word)
- A C O V E → ACOVE (valid word)
- A D O B E → ADOBE (valid word)
- A D O M E → ADM OE (invalid)
- A D O M E → ADM OE (invalid)
- A L O N E → ALONE (invalid, N is ruled out)
- A L O D E → ALODE (invalid)
- A M O D E → AMODE (invalid)
- A M O R E → AMORE (invalid, R is ruled out)
- A M O C E → AMOCE (invalid)
- A T O N E → ATONE (invalid, N is ruled out)
- A T O M E → ATOME (invalid)
- A T O D E → ATODE (invalid)
- A T O L E → ATOLE (valid word)
- A C O D E, A C O M E, A D O B E, A T O L E all fit.

Among these, ""ACODE"" and ""ADOBE"" are both common. ""ACODE"" is more technical, while ""ADOBE"" is a well-known word. Let’s choose ""ADOBE"".

So far we know:
- Pattern: A _ O _ E
- Letters completely ruled out: R, S, G, N, D, B, M, L, C, V

Remaining candidate letters for positions 2 and 4 (must be distinct):  
F, H, I, J, K, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter English word of the form A _ O _ E using only these letters in positions 2 and 4.

Possible combinations:
- A F O _ E → AFOKE (invalid), AFOGE (invalid), AFOPE (invalid)
- A H O _ E → AHOKE (invalid), AHOPE (invalid)
- A I O _ E → AIODE (invalid)
- A J O _ E → AJOLE (invalid)

- A X O _ E → A X O K E (invalid)
- A Y O _ E → A Y O K E (invalid)
- A Z O _ E → A Z O K E (invalid)

Looking through these, the only valid English word that fits the pattern A _ O _ E and uses only the remaining letters is ""ATONE"", but N is already ruled out.  
Next possible valid word: ""ATOKE"" – but K is still allowed, and ""ATOKE"" is a valid word (variant spelling of ""attoke"", a type of dance).  
However, ""ATOKE"" is uncommon.  

Another possibility: ""APOKE"" – but P is allowed, and ""APOKE"" is a valid word (past tense of apoke, though rare).  

But the most common remaining valid word is ""ATOKE"".  

Let’s check: A(✓) T(?) O(✓) K(?) E(✓) – both T and K are still allowed.
