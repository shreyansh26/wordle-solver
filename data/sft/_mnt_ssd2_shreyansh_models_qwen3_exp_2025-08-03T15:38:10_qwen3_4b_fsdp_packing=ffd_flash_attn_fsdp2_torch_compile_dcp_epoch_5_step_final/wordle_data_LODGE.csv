For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include multiple vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's well-balanced with common consonants and vowels.

Let’s update what we now know after the two guesses.

From SLATE:
- S, A, T are not in the word.
- E is in position 5.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.

From LEVER:
- L is in position 1 (✓) → word starts with L.
- E is in the word but not in position 2 (first E) and not in position 4 (second E).  
  Since we already know E must be in position 5, this confirms E is only in position 5.
- V and R are not in the word.

So far:
- Word pattern: L _ _ _ E
- Letters known to be in the word: L, E
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, A, T, V, R
- Remaining positions 2, 3, 4 must be filled with letters not yet ruled out.

Good remaining consonants to test: N, D, C, G, B, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels to test: I, O, U (since A is out and E is already placed).

Let’s try a word that fits L _ _ _ E, uses new letters in positions 2-4, and avoids the excluded letters.

Candidate words:
- LIGHT – H and I are new, but G is new too.  But I is vowel, H is consonant, G is consonant.  Fits.
- LINED – I and N and D are new.
- LINGO – I, N, G, O are new, but O is vowel and G is consonant.
- LIMPY – I, M, P, Y are new, but Y is sometimes vowel.
- LONGE – but O and N and G and E, but starts with L, ends with E, but LONGE is 5 letters, but is it valid?  Actually LONGE is a word (French loanword, but in Wordle list?  Not sure.)
- LUNGE – U and N and G and E, but U is vowel, N and G are consonants.

LUNGE seems good: L U N G E – positions 2-5: U, N, G, E.  E is already known at 5, so positions 2-4: U, N, G.  All letters are new (U, N, G) and none are excluded (S, A, T, V, R).

From the new feedback on LUNGE:

- L(✓) – already known to be in position 1.
- U(x) – U is not in the word.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- G(✓) – G is in the word and in position 4.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5.

So the pattern is now: L _ _ G E

Letters known to be in the word: L, G, E  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, A, T, V, R, U, N

We still need letters for positions 2 and 3.  
Available letters (excluding the banned ones and the already-used L, G, E):

Consonants left to test: B, C, D, F, H, I, K, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels left to test: I, O (since A, U are out)

We need two letters for positions 2 and 3.  
Let’s pick a word that uses new letters in those positions and keeps the pattern L _ _ G E.

Candidate words:
- LIDGE – but D and I are new, but “LIDGE” is not a common word.
- LIGHE – not a valid word.
- LIPGE – not a word.
- LIGNE – not a word.
- LIGAE – not a word.
- LIGOS – not a word.
- LIGMA – not a word.
- LIGMA – not a word.
- LIGMA – not a word.

- LIGHE – invalid
- LIGNE – invalid
- LIGAE – invalid
- LIGMA – invalid
- LIGOS – invalid

Wait, let’s think differently. We need to find common words. The pattern L _ _ G E is quite restrictive. Let’s list actual words:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include multiple vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's well-balanced with common consonants and vowels.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- L(-) → L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- T(x) → T is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains L somewhere other than position 2.
- It does NOT contain S, A, or T.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that has an L not in position 2. Good consonants to try now might be R, N, C, D, etc. Let’s pick a word that uses these ideas.

Possible candidates:
- CLONE (C, L, O, N, E) – L is in position 2, which we know is wrong, so skip.
- ELDER (E, L, D, E, R) – E repeats, but valid.
- BLEND (B, L, E, N, D) – L in position 2, skip.
- LEVER (L, E, V, E, R) – L in position 1, good.
- MERGE (M, E, R, G, E) – no L, skip.

Best choice seems LEVER: it has L in position 1 (not 2), ends with E, and introduces V and R to test.

Guess 2: LEVER -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) E(-) V(x) E(-) R(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s update what we now know after the two guesses.

From SLATE:
- S, A, T are not in the word.
- E is in position 5.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.

From LEVER:
- L is in position 1 (✓) → word starts with L.
- E is in the word but not in position 2 (first E) and not in position 4 (second E).  
  Since we already know E must be in position 5, this confirms E is only in position 5.
- V and R are not in the word.

So far:
- Word pattern: L _ _ _ E
- Letters known to be in the word: L, E
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, A, T, V, R
- Remaining positions 2, 3, 4 must be filled with letters not yet ruled out.

Good remaining consonants to test: N, D, C, G, B, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels to test: I, O, U (since A is out and E is already placed).

Let’s try a word that fits L _ _ _ E, uses new letters in positions 2-4, and avoids the excluded letters.

Candidate words:
- LIGHT – H and I are new, but G is new too.  But I is vowel, H is consonant, G is consonant.  Fits.
- LINED – I and N and D are new.
- LINGO – I, N, G, O are new, but O is vowel and G is consonant.
- LIMPY – I, M, P, Y are new, but Y is sometimes vowel.
- LONGE – but O and N and G and E, but starts with L, ends with E, but LONGE is 5 letters, but is it valid?  Actually LONGE is a word (French loanword, but in Wordle list?  Not sure.)
- LUNGE – U and N and G and E, but U is vowel, N and G are consonants.

LUNGE seems good: L U N G E – positions 2-5: U, N, G, E.  E is already known at 5, so positions 2-4: U, N, G.  All letters are new (U, N, G) and none are excluded (S, A, T, V, R).

Let’s go with LUNGE.

From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
   - E is in position 5.
   - L is in the word but not position 2.

2. LEVER → L(✓) E(-) V(x) E(-) R(x)
   - L is in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not positions 2 or 4 (confirmed it’s only in 5).
   - V, R are out.

3. LUNGE → L(✓) U(x) N(x) G(✓) E(✓)
   - L is in position 1 (already known).
   - G is in position 4.
   - U, N are out.

So the pattern is now:
L _ _ G E

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
Consonants: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, X, Y, Z
Vowels: I, O (since A, U are out and E is fixed)

We need two new letters for positions 2 and 3 from the remaining pool.

Candidate words:
- L I G E ?  – but we need 5 letters ending in GE, so “LIGNE” is invalid (N is out).
- L O G E ?  – “LOGE” is 4 letters.
- L I G E ?  – “LIGNE” is 5 letters but N is out.

Wait, we need 5 letters: L _ _ G E.

Possible combinations:
- L I D G E → “LIDGE” – not a valid word.
- L I C G E → “LICGE” – invalid.
- L O D G E → “LODGE” – valid word.
- L O B G E → “LOBGE” – invalid.
- L I M G E → “LIMGE” – invalid.
- L O M G E → “LOMGE” – invalid.

“LODGE” fits the pattern L _ _ G E with O and D as new letters, neither of which have been ruled out.

Let’s verify:
- L(✓) O(new) D(new) G(✓) E(✓)
- No excluded letters (S, A, T, V, R, U, N) are used.

So the next guess is LODGE.
