### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. These letters appear in many 5-letter words, giving good coverage for the first guess
4. The word itself is valid and common

This should provide good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on “arose”:

- A (x) – not in the word  
- R (x) – not in the word  
- O (✓) – in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter)  
- S (-) – in the word but not in the 4th position  
- E (✓) – in the word and in the correct position (5th letter)

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ O _ E  
and must contain the letter S somewhere, but not in position 4.

Good consonants to test next are T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.  
I’ll try a word that keeps O and E fixed, places S in a new spot, and introduces new common consonants.  
A strong candidate is “STOLE”:

- S in position 1 (new spot for S)  
- T, L new consonants  
- O and E already known correct  
- Uses only letters we know are in the word (O, E, S) plus new ones (T, L) to test coverage.
