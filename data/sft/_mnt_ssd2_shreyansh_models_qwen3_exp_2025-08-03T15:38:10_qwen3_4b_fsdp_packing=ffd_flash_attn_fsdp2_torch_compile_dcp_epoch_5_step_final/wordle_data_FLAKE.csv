For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers many vowels)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

5. Letters eliminated so far: R, I, S, C, O.
6. Letters confirmed present: A, L, K, E.

3. We must avoid R, I, S.

Good letters to test next are common consonants and remaining vowels. Since we have A confirmed, and need another vowel, let’s try O or U. Common consonants left include T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A strong next guess would test new common consonants and the remaining vowel (O or U) while placing A in a new spot. A good candidate is ""CLOAK"":
- C: new consonant
- L: new consonant
- O: new vowel
- A: confirmed in word (position 4 here)

Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:\n\n- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)\n- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)\n- ADIEU (covers many vowels)\n- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)\n\nI\'ll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on RAISE:\n- R: not in the word (x)\n- A: in the word but wrong position (-)\n- I: not in the word (x)\n- S: not in the word (x)\n- E: in the word and correct position (✓) → E is the 5th letter.\n\nSo we know:\n1.

Since we have A confirmed, and need another vowel, let’s try O or U. Common consonants left include T, N, L, C, D, etc.\n\nA strong next guess would test new common consonants and the remaining vowel (O or U) while placing A in a new spot.

From the latest feedback on BLAKE:
- B: not in the word (x)
- L: correct in position 2 (✓)
- A: correct in position 3 (✓)
- K: correct in position 4 (✓)
- E: correct in position 5 (✓)

So we now know the exact pattern: _ L A K E

Only the first letter is unknown. We need a consonant that hasn't been eliminated yet. Eliminated consonants so far: R, C, B, S, I, O. Common remaining consonants: D, F, G, H, M, N, P, T, W, Y.

Possible 5-letter words ending in LAKE:
- GLAKE (but GLAKE isn't a valid word)
- FLAKE (F is still possible)
- PLAKE (not a valid word)
- SLAKE (but S is eliminated)
- DLAKE (invalid)
- HLAKE (invalid)
- ULAKE (invalid)

The only valid English word fitting _ L A K E is ""FLAKE"".
