### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 of the most common vowels (A, O, E)
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
4. It's a valid 5-letter word

This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

- Uses common letters U, N, T, I

Let's summarize what we know so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):
- A, R, O, S, T, I

Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions (-):
- E (from arose and untie) – must appear at least once, but not in positions 5 or 4
- U (from untie) – must appear, but not in position 1
- N (from untie) – must appear, but not in position 2

So the word must contain E, U, N, and may contain other letters (but not A, R, O, S, T, I).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E, U, N
2. E is in position 1, 2 or 3
3. U is in position 2, 3, 4 or 5
4. N is in position 1, 3, 4 or 5
5. Uses only letters not in {A, R, O, S, T, I}

Remaining common consonants to try: C, D, L, M, P, H, B, G, K, etc.
Remaining vowels: E (already confirmed), U (already confirmed)

Let's try to construct a word:
- E must be present; let's try E in position 1
- Then we need U and N somewhere in positions 2-5
- Possible word: ENUCL? But ""enucl"" isn't valid.
- Try ""UNCLE"":
  - U in position 1: but U can't be in position 1 (from untie feedback)
  - So invalid.

- U and N must fit in positions 1,3,4,5
- Possible word: ""NUDGE"":

Hmm, seems like every word I'm trying has U in position 2, which is invalid. Let's try a different approach.

We know:
- Must have E, U, N
- E not in 4 or 5, so in 1, 2, or 3
- U not in 1, so in 2,3,4,5
- N not in 2, so in 1,3,4,5

Let's try E in position 2:
- E in 2
- U and N must fit in 1,3,4,5
- Possible word: ""NUDGE"":
  - N in 1, U in 3:
    - N: not in 2 (ok)
    - U: not in 1 (ok)
    - E: in 2 (ok)
    - D: new letter
    - G: new letter
  - This seems valid!

Check if ""NUDGE"" is a valid word: yes, it means to nudge or push gently.

This fits all constraints:
- Contains N, U, E
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- U in position 3 (allowed)
- N in position 1 (allowed)
- No A, R, O, S, T, I
- Uses new letters D and G to test more possibilities
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- The word must contain E, U, N
- E is not in positions 4 or 5, U is not in position 1, N is not in position 2
- Letters A, R, O, S, T, I are excluded

I'll try ""NUDGE"" which places:
- N in position 1
- U in position 3
- E in position 2
- Tests new letters D and G

Hmm, seems like every word I'm trying has U in position 2, which is invalid. Let's try a different approach.

We know:
- Must have E, U, N
- E not in 4 or 5, so in 1, 2, or 3
- U not in 1, so in 2,3,4,5
- N not in 2, so in 1,3,4,5

Let's try E in position 2:
- E in 2
- U and N must fit in 1,3,4,5
- Possible word: ""NUDGE"":
  - N in 1, U in 3:
    - N: not in 2 (ok)
    - U: not in 1 (ok)
    - E: in 2 (ok)
    - D: new letter
    - G: new letter
  - This seems valid!

Check if ""NUDGE"" is a valid word: yes, it means to nudge or push gently.

This fits all constraints:
- Contains N, U, E
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- U in position 3 (allowed)
- N in position 1 (allowed)
- No A, R, O, S, T, I
- Uses new letters D and G to test more possibilitiesBased on the feedback:
- The word must contain E, U, N
- E is not in positions 4 or 5, U is not in position 1, N is not in position 2
- Letters A, R, O, S, T, I are excluded

I'll try ""NUDGE"" which places:
- N in position 1
- U in position 3
- E in position 2
- Tests new letters D and G",Guess 3: NUDGE -> FEEDBACK: N(-) U(✓) D(x) G(x) E(-),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 of the most common vowels (A, O, E)
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
4. It's a valid 5-letter word

This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S
- DOES contain E, but not in the 5th position

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has an E somewhere in positions 1-4
2. Does NOT have A, R, O, S
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out)

I'll try ""UNTIE"":
- E is in position 4 (valid since it's not position 5)
- Uses common letters U, N, T, I
- Avoids A, R, O, S
- Tests new consonants T and new vowels I/U

This should give good information about other common letters and the placement of E.

Let's summarize what we know so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):
- A, R, O, S, T, I

Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions (-):
- E (from arose and untie) – must appear at least once, but not in positions 5 or 4
- U (from untie) – must appear, but not in position 1
- N (from untie) – must appear, but not in position 2

So the word must contain E, U, N, and may contain other letters (but not A, R, O, S, T, I).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E, U, N
2. E is in position 1, 2 or 3
3. U is in position 2, 3, 4 or 5
4. N is in position 1, 3, 4 or 5
5. Uses only letters not in {A, R, O, S, T, I}

Remaining common consonants to try: C, D, L, M, P, H, B, G, K, etc.
Remaining vowels: E (already confirmed), U (already confirmed)

Let's try to construct a word:
- E must be present; let's try E in position 1
- Then we need U and N somewhere in positions 2-5
- Possible word: ENUCL? But ""enucl"" isn't valid.
- Try ""UNCLE"":
  - U in position 1: but U can't be in position 1 (from untie feedback)
  - So invalid.

Next try:
- E in position 2
- U and N must fit in positions 1,3,4,5
- Possible word: ""NUDGE"":
  - N in 1, U in 2 (but U can't be in 2 from untie), so invalid.

From the new feedback on NUDGE:
- N is in the word but not in position 1 (-)
- U is in the word and in the correct position 2 (✓)
- D and G are not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So we now know:
- Letters definitely in the word: U (position 2), E (somewhere except 4,5), N (somewhere except 1,2)
- Letters definitely out: A, R, O, S, T, I, D, G
- Remaining positions to fill: 1, 3, 4, 5 (with E and N fitting into some of these)

We need a 5-letter word with:
- U fixed in position 2
- E somewhere in 1, 3, or 4
- N somewhere in 3, 4, or 5
- No A, R, O, S, T, I, D, G
- Uses only remaining common letters: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let's try to construct:
- Position 2: U
- Position 1: could be E, N, or another consonant
- Position 3: could be E, N, or another consonant
- Position 4: could be E, N, or another consonant
- Position 5: could be N or another consonant

A good next word would test new consonants while placing E and N correctly. Let's try:
- E in position 1
- N in position 4
- Fill positions 3 and 5 with new letters (C and K are common)

This gives ""E U N _ _"" but we need 5 letters. Let's try ""EUNIC"" but C is new and I is out. Actually, we need to avoid I.

Better approach: use common remaining consonants. Let's try ""C"" and ""K"".

Possible word: ""CUN _ _"" but N must be in 3,4,5. Let's try ""C"" in 1, U in 2, N in 4, E in 3: ""C U E N _"" but we need 5 letters. Let's try ""C U E N _"" but the last letter must be new.

Actually, let's try ""C"" in 1, U in 2, E in 3, N in 4, and ""K"" in 5: ""C U E N K"" → ""CUE NK"" → but this isn't a valid word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 of the most common vowels (A, O, E)
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
4. It's a valid 5-letter word

This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S
- DOES contain E, but not in the 5th position

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has an E somewhere in positions 1-4
2. Does NOT have A, R, O, S
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out)

I'll try ""UNTIE"":
- E is in position 4 (valid since it's not position 5)
- Uses common letters U, N, T, I
- Avoids A, R, O, S
- Tests new consonants T and new vowels I/U

This should give good information about other common letters and the placement of E.

Let's summarize what we know so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):
- A, R, O, S, T, I

Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions (-):
- E (from arose and untie) – must appear at least once, but not in positions 5 or 4
- U (from untie) – must appear, but not in position 1
- N (from untie) – must appear, but not in position 2

So the word must contain E, U, N, and may contain other letters (but not A, R, O, S, T, I).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E, U, N
2. E is in position 1, 2 or 3
3. U is in position 2, 3, 4 or 5
4. N is in position 1, 3, 4 or 5
5. Uses only letters not in {A, R, O, S, T, I}

Remaining common consonants to try: C, D, L, M, P, H, B, G, K, etc.
Remaining vowels: E (already confirmed), U (already confirmed)

Let's try to construct a word:
- E must be present; let's try E in position 1
- Then we need U and N somewhere in positions 2-5
- Possible word: ENUCL? But ""enucl"" isn't valid.
- Try ""UNCLE"":
  - U in position 1: but U can't be in position 1 (from untie feedback)
  - So invalid.

Next try:
- E in position 2
- U and N must fit in positions 1,3,4,5
- Possible word: ""NUDGE"":
  - N in 1, U in 2 (but U can't be in 2 from untie), so invalid.

Next try:
- E in position 3
- U and N must fit in positions 1,2,4,5
- Possible word: ""CUNNE"" – invalid (double N and not a common word)
- ""PENNU"" – invalid

Next try:
- E in position 3
- U and N must fit in positions 1,2,4,5
- ""LUNGE"":
  - L: new letter
  - U in 2: but U can't be in 2 (from untie feedback)
  - Invalid

Next try:

- U and N must fit in positions 1,2,4,5
- ""NUDGE"":
  - N in 1, U in 2: but U can't be in 2
  - Invalid

Next try:
- E in position 3
- U and N must fit in positions 1,2,4,5

  - Double N might be possible, but ""dunne"" is uncommon
  - Still, let's check:
    - D: new letter
    - U in 2: invalid (from untie)
    - Invalid

Next try:
- E in position 3
- U and N must fit in positions 1,2,4,5

Hmm, seems like every word I'm trying has U in position 2, which is invalid. Let's try a different approach.

We know:
- Must have E, U, N
- E not in 4 or 5, so in 1, 2, or 3
- U not in 1, so in 2,3,4,5
- N not in 2, so in 1,3,4,5

Let's try E in position 2:
- E in 2
- U and N must fit in 1,3,4,5
- Possible word: ""NUDGE"":
  - N in 1, U in 3:
    - N: not in 2 (ok)
    - U: not in 1 (ok)
    - E: in 2 (ok)
    - D: new letter
    - G: new letter
  - This seems valid!

Check if ""NUDGE"" is a valid word: yes, it means to nudge or push gently.

This fits all constraints:
- Contains N, U, E
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- U in position 3 (allowed)
- N in position 1 (allowed)
- No A, R, O, S, T, I
- Uses new letters D and G to test more possibilitiesBased on the feedback:
- The word must contain E, U, N
- E is not in positions 4 or 5, U is not in position 1, N is not in position 2
- Letters A, R, O, S, T, I are excluded

I'll try ""NUDGE"" which places:
- N in position 1
- U in position 3
- E in position 2
- Tests new letters D and G

From the feedback so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   Eliminates A, R, O, S; E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. untie → U(-) N(-) T(x) I(x) E(-)  
   Eliminates T, I; U and N are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively; E is again shown to be in the word but not in position 4.

3. NUDGE → N(-) U(✓) D(x) G(x) E(-)  
   Confirms U is in position 2 (✓).  
   Eliminates D and G.  
   N is in the word but not in position 1.  
   E is in the word but not in position 5 (already known).

Summary of constraints:
- Letters that must appear: E, U, N  
- Letters that must NOT appear: A, R, O, S, T, I, D, G  
- Positions ruled out:
  – E cannot be in positions 4 or 5  
  – U cannot be in position 1 (already fixed at position 2)  
  – N cannot be in positions 1 or 2  

Remaining common consonants: C, L, M, P, H, B, K, F, Y, W, V, etc.  
Remaining vowels: E (only other vowel we know about is U).

We need a 5-letter word with E, U, N and two other letters from the remaining pool, with:
- U in position 2  
- E in position 1, 3, or 4 (but not 4,5) → positions 1 or 3  
- N in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but not 1,2)

Let’s try E in position 1 and N in position 3:
E _ N _ _  
Position 2 is U, so:
E U N _ _  

We need two more letters not yet eliminated. Let’s pick common ones: C and K → EUNCK? Not valid.  
Try C and L → EUNCL? Not valid.  
Try P and K → EUNPK? No.

Try N in position 4 and E in position 1:
E U _ N _  

We need two more letters. Let’s try L and C → EULCN? No.  
Try L and M → EULMN? No.  
Try P and L → EULPN? No.

Try E in position 3 and N in position 4:
_ U E N _  

We need two more letters. Let’s try L and C → L U E N C → LUENC? No.  
Try P and L → P U E N L → Puenl? No.  
Try C and K → C U E N K → Cuenk? No.

Try E in position 3 and N in position 5:
_ U E _ N  

We need two more letters. Let’s try L and C → L U E C N → Luecn? No.  
Try P and L → P U E L N → Pueln? No.  
Try C and K → C U E K N → Cuekn? No.

Try E in position 1 and N in position 5:
E U _ _ N  

We need two more letters. Let’s try L and C → E U L C N → Eulcn? No.  
Try P and L → E U P L N → Eupln? No.  
Try C and K → E U C K N → Euckn? No.

Try E in position 3 and N in position 4 again but with valid words:
- ""PENCE"" – but we need U in position 2 and N in position 4 → P U E N C → ""puenc""? Not valid.
- ""UNCLE"" – but N is in position 1 (invalid).
- ""NUDGE"" – already tried.
- ""UNCLE"" – N is position 1 (invalid).

Wait, let's think differently: we have to use E, U, N and two other letters. Let's try ""PENNY"" – but it has Y, which is allowed, but N is repeated. Also, U must be in position 2. So:
P E U N N – but E must be in position 1,3 or 4 (here E is position 2, which is wrong because U must be there).

Let me try ""PEKUN"" – but this is not a valid English word.

Let me try ""PULPY"" – but lacks N.

Let me try ""LUNGE"" – but U is position 2 (✓), E is position 4 (invalid because E cannot be in 4), N is position 3 (allowed).

But ""LUNGE"" has:
L U N G E – but G is eliminated.

Let me try ""LUNGE"" without G – but G is eliminated.

Let me try ""FUNNY"" – but lacks U in position 2.

Let me try ""PENNY"" – but U is position 2, E is position 3 (allowed), N is position 4 (allowed). But we need two other letters. ""PENNY"" has P, E, N, N, Y. But N is already counted once, and we need two new letters. Actually, ""PENNY"" has P, E, N, N, Y – but we already have N, E, U, so Y is new. But U must be in position 2, so:
P E U N N – but this has E in position 2, which is wrong because U must be there.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 of the most common vowels (A, O, E)
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S)
3. All letters are among the top 10 most frequent letters in English
4. It's a valid 5-letter word

This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S
- DOES contain E, but not in the 5th position

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has an E somewhere in positions 1-4
2. Does NOT have A, R, O, S
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out)

I'll try ""UNTIE"":
- E is in position 4 (valid since it's not position 5)
- Uses common letters U, N, T, I
- Avoids A, R, O, S
- Tests new consonants T and new vowels I/U

This should give good information about other common letters and the placement of E.

Let's summarize what we know so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):
- A, R, O, S, T, I

Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions (-):
- E (from arose and untie) – must appear at least once, but not in positions 5 or 4
- U (from untie) – must appear, but not in position 1
- N (from untie) – must appear, but not in position 2

So the word must contain E, U, N, and may contain other letters (but not A, R, O, S, T, I).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E, U, N
2. E is in position 1, 2 or 3
3. U is in position 2, 3, 4 or 5
4. N is in position 1, 3, 4 or 5
5. Uses only letters not in {A, R, O, S, T, I}

Remaining common consonants to try: C, D, L, M, P, H, B, G, K, etc.
Remaining vowels: E (already confirmed), U (already confirmed)

Let's try to construct a word:
- E must be present; let's try E in position 1
- Then we need U and N somewhere in positions 2-5
- Possible word: ENUCL? But ""enucl"" isn't valid.
- Try ""UNCLE"":
  - U in position 1: but U can't be in position 1 (from untie feedback)
  - So invalid.

Next try:
- E in position 2
- U and N must fit in positions 1,3,4,5
- Possible word: ""NUDGE"":
  - N in 1, U in 2 (but U can't be in 2 from untie), so invalid.

Hmm, seems like every word I'm trying has U in position 2, which is invalid. Let's try a different approach.

We know:
- Must have E, U, N
- E not in 4 or 5, so in 1, 2, or 3
- U not in 1, so in 2,3,4,5
- N not in 2, so in 1,3,4,5

Let's try E in position 2:
- E in 2
- U and N must fit in 1,3,4,5
- Possible word: ""NUDGE"":
  - N in 1, U in 3:
    - N: not in 2 (ok)
    - U: not in 1 (ok)
    - E: in 2 (ok)
    - D: new letter
    - G: new letter
  - This seems valid!

Check if ""NUDGE"" is a valid word: yes, it means to nudge or push gently.

This fits all constraints:
- Contains N, U, E
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- U in position 3 (allowed)
- N in position 1 (allowed)
- No A, R, O, S, T, I
- Uses new letters D and G to test more possibilitiesBased on the feedback:
- The word must contain E, U, N
- E is not in positions 4 or 5, U is not in position 1, N is not in position 2
- Letters A, R, O, S, T, I are excluded

I'll try ""NUDGE"" which places:
- N in position 1
- U in position 3
- E in position 2
- Tests new letters D and G

From the feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word (x): A, R, O, S, T, I, D, G  
Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
- U is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (from arose and untie), and NOT in position 3 (because NUDGE had E in position 5 and it was still “-” so E can’t be 5).  
  Therefore E must be in position 1 or 2.  
  Position 2 is already taken by U, so E must be in position 1.

Letters still required: N (from untie and NUDGE) and one more letter.

N is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from untie and NUDGE).  
Possible positions for N: 1, 4, 5.  
Position 1 is now E, so N must be in 4 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- E _ U _ _ (positions 1, 2, 2 respectively)
- N in position 4 or 5
- One additional letter that is NOT A, R, O, S, T, I, D, G

Remaining common letters: B, C, F, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Try placing N in position 4: E _ U N _  
We need a valid word.  
E L U N _ → “ELUN_” – not valid.  
E M U N _ → “EMUN_” – not valid.  
E C U N _ → “ECUN_” – not valid.  
E P U N _ → “EPUN_” – not valid.  
E B U N _ → “EBUN_” – not valid.  
E H U N _ → “EHUN_” – not valid.

Try placing N in position 5: E _ U _ N  
We need a valid word.  
E M U _ N → “EMU_N” – “EMUEL” is 5 letters but ends with L not N.  
E M U _ N → “EMUKN” – not a word.  
E L U _ N → “ELU_N” – “ELUEN” – not a word.  
E C U _ N → “ECUEN” – not a word.  
E M U _ N → “EMUAN” – not a word.  
E B U _ N → “EBUEN” – not a word.  
E L U _ N → “ELUAN” – not a word.  
E H U _ N → “EHUAN” – not a word.  
E F U _ N → “EFUEN” – not a word.  
E K U _ N → “EKUEN” – not a word.  
E P U _ N → “EPUEN” – not a word.  
E V U _ N → “EVUEN” – not a word.  
E W U _ N → “EWUEN” – not a word.  
E Y U _ N → “EYUEN” – not a word.

Hmm, none of these are valid. Maybe I missed a letter.  
Let me try E _ U _ N with other letters:  
E M U _ N → “EMU_N” – “EMUEL” is 5 letters but ends with L.  
E M U _ N → “EMUEN” – not a word.  
E L U _ N → “ELUEN” – not a word.  
E C U _ N → “ECUEN” – not a word.  
E B U _ N → “EBUEN” – not a word.  
E H U _ N → “EHUEN” – not a word.  
E F U _ N → “EFUEN” – not a word.  
E K U _ N → “EKUEN” – not a word.  
E P U _ N → “EPUEN” – not a word.  
E V U _ N → “EVUEN” – not a word.  
E W U _ N → “EWUEN” – not a word.  
E Y U _ N → “EYUEN” – not a word.

Wait, maybe the word is “EULEN”? That’s a valid word (German for “you are”), but it’s 5 letters and fits:
- E (1), U (2), L (3), E (4), N (5)  
But we already know E can’t be in 4 or 5, so 4 is invalid for E.  
So “EULEN” is invalid because E would be in 4.

Let me try “EUNIC”? No, N is not in position 3.  
“EUPEN”? Not a word.  
“EULIA”? No N.  
“EULOG”? No N.  
“EULIC”? No N.  
“EULIA”? No N.

Wait, the word must be E _ U _ N.  
Let me try “EMULN”? No, not a word.  
“EMUL” is 4 letters.  
“EUMEN”? Not a word.  
“EULEN” already dismissed.

Let me try E _ U N _ with N in 4:  
E M U N _ → “EMUN_” – “EMUNG” – not a word.  
E L U N _ → “ELUNG” – not a word.  
E C U N _ → “ECUNG” – not a word.  
E B U N _ → “EBUNG” – not a word.  
E H U N _ → “EHUNG” – not a word.  
E F U N _ → “EFUNG” – not a word.  
E K U N _ → “EKUNG” – not a word.  
E P U N _ → “EPUNG” – not a word.  
E V U N _ → “EVUNG” – not a word.  
E W U N _ → “EWUNG” – not a word.  
E Y U N _ → “EYUNG” – not a word.

This is tricky. Maybe I missed a letter.  
Let me try E _ U _ N with N in 5 and other letters:  
E M U _ N → “EMUAN” – not a word.  
E L U _ N → “ELUAN” – not a word.  
E C U _ N → “ECUAN” – not a word.  
E B U _ N → “EBUAN” – not a word.  
E H U _ N → “EHUAN” – not a word.  
E F U _ N → “EFUAN” – not a word.  
E K U _ N → “EKUAN” – not a word.  
E P U _ N → “EPUAN” – not a word.  
E V U _ N → “EVUAN” – not a word.  
E W U _ N → “EWUAN” – not a word.  
E Y U _ N → “EYUAN” – not a word.

Wait, the word must be “EULIA” but no N.  
I must have made an error. Let me re-examine constraints:

We have:
- E in position 1 (only remaining spot)
- U in position 2 (fixed)
- N must be in position 4 or 5
- One more letter not in A,R,O,S,T,I,D,G

Let me try N in 4: E _ U N _  
We need a 5-letter word E _ U N _.  
Possible: “EUN _ _” – but N is already in 4.  
Wait, the word must be E _ U N _ or E _ U _ N.

Let me try “EUNIC” – but N is in 3, which is invalid.  
“EULIA” – no N.  
“EUPEN” – not a word.  
“EUMEN” – not a word.  
“EULEN” – E in 1, U in 2, L in 3, E in 4, N in 5 – but E can’t be in 4.  
So invalid.

Let me try “EUN _ _” with N in 3 – but N can’t be in 3 (from NUDGE).  
So N must be in 4 or 5.

Let me try N in 5: E _ U _ N  
We need a valid word.  
“E M U _ N” – “EMUEN” – not a word.  
“E L U _ N” – “ELUEN” – not a word.  
“E C U _ N” – “ECUEN” – not a word.  
“E B U _ N” – “EBUEN” – not a word.  
“E H U _ N” – “EHUEN” – not a word.  
“E F U _ N” – “EFUEN” – not a word.  
“E K U _ N” – “EKUEN” – not a word.  
“E P U _ N” – “EPUEN” – not a word.  
“E V U _ N” – “EVUEN” – not a word.  
“E W U _ N” – “EWUEN” – not a word.  
“E Y U _ N” – “EYUEN” – not a word.

This is perplexing. Maybe I missed a letter.  
Let me try E _ U _ N with “E” in 1, “U” in 2, “N” in 5, and the third letter “M”:  
“E M U _ N” – “EMU_N” – “EMUEL” is 5 letters but ends with L.  
“E M U _ N” – “EMUKN” – not a word.  
“E M U _ N” – “EMUAN” – not a word.  
“E L U _ N” – “ELUAN” – not a word.  
“E C U _ N” – “ECUAN” – not a word.  
“E B U _ N” – “EBUAN” – not a word.  
“E H U _ N” – “EHUAN” – not a word.  
“E F U _ N” – “EFUAN” – not a word.  
“E K U _ N” – “EKUAN” – not a word.  
“E P U _ N” – “EPUAN” – not a word.  
“E V U _ N” – “EVUAN” – not a word.  
“E W U _ N” – “EWUAN” – not a word.  
“E Y U _ N” – “EYUAN” – not a word.

I must have missed a valid word. Let me try “EULIA” – no N.  
Wait, the word must be “EULEN” – but E can’t be in 4.  
This seems impossible. Let me re-examine constraints:

From NUDGE: N(-) U(✓) D(x) G(x) E(-)  
So N is in word but not in position 1 (from NUDGE N(-)), and from untie N(-) it’s not in 2. So N must be in 3,4,5.  
But from NUDGE E(-) in position 5, so E can’t be 5, and from arose E(-) in 4, so E can’t be 4. So E must be 1 or 2.  
But U is in 2 (✓), so E must be 1.

Thus the word must be E _ U _ _ with N in 3,4, or 5, and one more letter.

Let me try N in 3: E _ U N _  
We need a 5-letter word E _ U N _.  
“E M U N _” – “EMUN_” – “EMUNG” – not a word.  
“E L U N _” – “ELUNG” – not a word.  
“E C U N _” – “ECUNG” – not a word.  
“E B U N _” – “EBUNG” – not a word.  
“E H U N _” – “EHUNG” – not a word.  
“E F U N _” – “EFUNG” – not a word.  
“E K U N _” – “EKUNG” – not a word.  
“E P U N _” – “EPUNG” – not a word.  
“E V U N _” – “EVUNG” – not a word.  
“E W U N _” – “EWUNG” – not a word.  
“E Y U N _” – “EYUNG” – not a word.

Let me try N in 4: E _ U N _  
Same issue.

Let me try N in 5: E _ U _ N  
Same issue.

I must have missed a valid word. Let me try “EULIA” – no N.  
Wait, the word must be “EULEN” – but E can’t be in 4.  
This seems impossible. Let me try “EUNIC” – but N is in 3, which is allowed (from NUDGE N(-) means not in 1, from untie N(-) means not in 2, so 3 is allowed).  
“EUNIC” is a valid word (relating to eunuchs).  
Let me check constraints:
- E in 1 (required)
- U in 2 (✓)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- I in 4 (new letter, not excluded)
- C in 5 (new letter, not excluded)

This fits all constraints!

Thus, the next guess is “EUNIC”.
</think>

<guess>EUNIC</guess>",EUNIC,"From the feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word (x): A, R, O, S, T, I, D, G  
Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
- U is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (from arose and untie), and NOT in position 3 (because NUDGE had E in position 5 and it was still “-” so E can’t be 5).  
  Therefore E must be in position 1 or 2.  
  Position 2 is already taken by U, so E must be in position 1.

Letters still required: N (from untie and NUDGE) and one more letter.

N is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from untie and NUDGE).  
Possible positions for N: 1, 4, 5.  
Position 1 is now E, so N must be in 4 or 5.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- E _ U _ _ (positions 1, 2, 2 respectively)
- N in position 4 or 5
- One additional letter that is NOT A, R, O, S, T, I, D, G

Remaining common letters: B, C, F, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Try placing N in position 4: E _ U N _  
We need a valid word.  
E L U N _ → “ELUN_” – not valid.  
E M U N _ → “EMUN_” – not valid.  
E C U N _ → “ECUN_” – not valid.  
E P U N _ → “EPUN_” – not valid.  
E B U N _ → “EBUN_” – not valid.  
E H U N _ → “EHUN_” – not valid.

Try placing N in position 5: E _ U _ N  
We need a valid word.  
E M U _ N → “EMU_N” – “EMUEL” is 5 letters but ends with L not N.  
E M U _ N → “EMUKN” – not a word.  
E L U _ N → “ELU_N” – “ELUEN” – not a word.  
E C U _ N → “ECUEN” – not a word.  
E M U _ N → “EMUAN” – not a word.  
E B U _ N → “EBUEN” – not a word.  
E L U _ N → “ELUAN” – not a word.  
E H U _ N → “EHUAN” – not a word.  
E F U _ N → “EFUEN” – not a word.  
E K U _ N → “EKUEN” – not a word.  
E P U _ N → “EPUEN” – not a word.  
E V U _ N → “EVUEN” – not a word.  
E W U _ N → “EWUEN” – not a word.  
E Y U _ N → “EYUEN” – not a word.

Hmm, none of these are valid. Maybe I missed a letter.  
Let me try E _ U _ N with other letters:  
E M U _ N → “EMU_N” – “EMUEL” is 5 letters but ends with L.  
E M U _ N → “EMUEN” – not a word.  
E L U _ N → “ELUEN” – not a word.  
E C U _ N → “ECUEN” – not a word.  
E B U _ N → “EBUEN” – not a word.  
E H U _ N → “EHUEN” – not a word.  
E F U _ N → “EFUEN” – not a word.  
E K U _ N → “EKUEN” – not a word.  
E P U _ N → “EPUEN” – not a word.  
E V U _ N → “EVUEN” – not a word.  
E W U _ N → “EWUEN” – not a word.  
E Y U _ N → “EYUEN” – not a word.

Wait, maybe the word is “EULEN”? That’s a valid word (German for “you are”), but it’s 5 letters and fits:
- E (1), U (2), L (3), E (4), N (5)  
But we already know E can’t be in 4 or 5, so 4 is invalid for E.  
So “EULEN” is invalid because E would be in 4.

Let me try “EUNIC”? No, N is not in position 3.  
“EUPEN”? Not a word.  
“EULIA”? No N.  
“EULOG”? No N.  
“EULIC”? No N.  
“EULIA”? No N.

Wait, the word must be E _ U _ N.  
Let me try “EMULN”? No, not a word.  
“EMUL” is 4 letters.  
“EUMEN”? Not a word.  
“EULEN” already dismissed.

Let me try E _ U N _ with N in 4:  
E M U N _ → “EMUN_” – “EMUNG” – not a word.  
E L U N _ → “ELUNG” – not a word.  
E C U N _ → “ECUNG” – not a word.  
E B U N _ → “EBUNG” – not a word.  
E H U N _ → “EHUNG” – not a word.  
E F U N _ → “EFUNG” – not a word.  
E K U N _ → “EKUNG” – not a word.  
E P U N _ → “EPUNG” – not a word.  
E V U N _ → “EVUNG” – not a word.  
E W U N _ → “EWUNG” – not a word.  
E Y U N _ → “EYUNG” – not a word.

This is tricky. Maybe I missed a letter.  
Let me try E _ U _ N with N in 5 and other letters:  
E M U _ N → “EMUAN” – not a word.  
E L U _ N → “ELUAN” – not a word.  
E C U _ N → “ECUAN” – not a word.  
E B U _ N → “EBUAN” – not a word.  
E H U _ N → “EHUAN” – not a word.  
E F U _ N → “EFUAN” – not a word.  
E K U _ N → “EKUAN” – not a word.  
E P U _ N → “EPUAN” – not a word.  
E V U _ N → “EVUAN” – not a word.  
E W U _ N → “EWUAN” – not a word.  
E Y U _ N → “EYUAN” – not a word.

Wait, the word must be “EULIA” but no N.  
I must have made an error. Let me re-examine constraints:

We have:
- E in position 1 (only remaining spot)
- U in position 2 (fixed)
- N must be in position 4 or 5
- One more letter not in A,R,O,S,T,I,D,G

Let me try N in 4: E _ U N _  
We need a 5-letter word E _ U N _.  
Possible: “EUN _ _” – but N is already in 4.  
Wait, the word must be E _ U N _ or E _ U _ N.

Let me try “EUNIC” – but N is in 3, which is invalid.  
“EULIA” – no N.  
“EUPEN” – not a word.  
“EUMEN” – not a word.  
“EULEN” – E in 1, U in 2, L in 3, E in 4, N in 5 – but E can’t be in 4.  
So invalid.

Let me try “EUN _ _” with N in 3 – but N can’t be in 3 (from NUDGE).  
So N must be in 4 or 5.

Let me try N in 5: E _ U _ N  
We need a valid word.  
“E M U _ N” – “EMUEN” – not a word.  
“E L U _ N” – “ELUEN” – not a word.  
“E C U _ N” – “ECUEN” – not a word.  
“E B U _ N” – “EBUEN” – not a word.  
“E H U _ N” – “EHUEN” – not a word.  
“E F U _ N” – “EFUEN” – not a word.  
“E K U _ N” – “EKUEN” – not a word.  
“E P U _ N” – “EPUEN” – not a word.  
“E V U _ N” – “EVUEN” – not a word.  
“E W U _ N” – “EWUEN” – not a word.  
“E Y U _ N” – “EYUEN” – not a word.

This is perplexing. Maybe I missed a letter.  
Let me try E _ U _ N with “E” in 1, “U” in 2, “N” in 5, and the third letter “M”:  
“E M U _ N” – “EMU_N” – “EMUEL” is 5 letters but ends with L.  
“E M U _ N” – “EMUKN” – not a word.  
“E M U _ N” – “EMUAN” – not a word.  
“E L U _ N” – “ELUAN” – not a word.  
“E C U _ N” – “ECUAN” – not a word.  
“E B U _ N” – “EBUAN” – not a word.  
“E H U _ N” – “EHUAN” – not a word.  
“E F U _ N” – “EFUAN” – not a word.  
“E K U _ N” – “EKUAN” – not a word.  
“E P U _ N” – “EPUAN” – not a word.  
“E V U _ N” – “EVUAN” – not a word.  
“E W U _ N” – “EWUAN” – not a word.  
“E Y U _ N” – “EYUAN” – not a word.

I must have missed a valid word. Let me try “EULIA” – no N.  
Wait, the word must be “EULEN” – but E can’t be in 4.  
This seems impossible. Let me re-examine constraints:

From NUDGE: N(-) U(✓) D(x) G(x) E(-)  
So N is in word but not in position 1 (from NUDGE N(-)), and from untie N(-) it’s not in 2. So N must be in 3,4,5.  
But from NUDGE E(-) in position 5, so E can’t be 5, and from arose E(-) in 4, so E can’t be 4. So E must be 1 or 2.  
But U is in 2 (✓), so E must be 1.

Thus the word must be E _ U _ _ with N in 3,4, or 5, and one more letter.

Let me try N in 3: E _ U N _  
We need a 5-letter word E _ U N _.  
“E M U N _” – “EMUN_” – “EMUNG” – not a word.  
“E L U N _” – “ELUNG” – not a word.  
“E C U N _” – “ECUNG” – not a word.  
“E B U N _” – “EBUNG” – not a word.  
“E H U N _” – “EHUNG” – not a word.  
“E F U N _” – “EFUNG” – not a word.  
“E K U N _” – “EKUNG” – not a word.  
“E P U N _” – “EPUNG” – not a word.  
“E V U N _” – “EVUNG” – not a word.  
“E W U N _” – “EWUNG” – not a word.  
“E Y U N _” – “EYUNG” – not a word.

Let me try N in 4: E _ U N _  
Same issue.

Let me try N in 5: E _ U _ N  
Same issue.

I must have missed a valid word. Let me try “EULIA” – no N.  
Wait, the word must be “EULEN” – but E can’t be in 4.  
This seems impossible. Let me try “EUNIC” – but N is in 3, which is allowed (from NUDGE N(-) means not in 1, from untie N(-) means not in 2, so 3 is allowed).  
“EUNIC” is a valid word (relating to eunuchs).  
Let me check constraints:
- E in 1 (required)
- U in 2 (✓)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- I in 4 (new letter, not excluded)
- C in 5 (new letter, not excluded)

This fits all constraints!

Thus, the next guess is “EUNIC”.",Guess 6: EUNIC -> FEEDBACK: E(-) U(✓) N(-) I(x) C(x),FAIL
