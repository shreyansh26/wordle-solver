For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any letters, so we can quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains five of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeats. This will give us maximum information about which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-)  – A is in the word but not in position 1.

- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E.
- Does contain A and O, but A cannot be in slot 1 and O cannot be in slot 3.

Letters we can now eliminate: R, S, E  
Letters we know are present: A, O  
Positions to avoid for A: 1  
Positions to avoid for O: 3  

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and O somewhere (but not in the forbidden positions).
- Avoids R, S, E entirely.
- Uses only remaining common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (besides A and O already known).

Let’s try a word that places A in position 2 or later and O in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and uses new common letters.

A good candidate is ""TOADY"":
- T (new letter)
- O (allowed in position 2)
- A (allowed in position 3)
- D (new letter)
- Y (new letter)

This uses O and A in new positions and introduces three new common letters (T, D, Y) to gain more information.

From the two guesses we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, T, D, Y
2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - O is in position 2 (from Guess 2: O(✓) in slot 2)
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from Guess 1: A(-)) and also NOT in position 3 (from Guess 2: A(✓) in slot 3 is actually correct, so A is in position 3). Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.

Guess 2: toady -> T(x) O(✓) A(✓) D(x) Y(x)
- O(✓) means O is in the word and in the correct position, which is slot 2.
- A(✓) means A is in the word and in the correct position, which is slot 3.

So the pattern so far is:
_ O A _ _

Letters known to be in the word and their positions:
- O in slot 2
- A in slot 3

Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, S, E, T, D, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Has A in position 3
- Does NOT contain R, S, E, T, D, Y
- Uses only the remaining letters

Remaining common letters (excluding the banned ones): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need two more letters (positions 1, 4, 5) from these remaining ones. To maximize information, let's pick common letters that haven't been tested yet. Good candidates are B, C, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, U.

Let's try to form a word with these constraints. One common word that fits is ""COBIA"" but it has B and I which are allowed, but also has a second B which might not be optimal. Another is ""FOCAL"" but L is allowed. Let me think of a word with O in 2, A in 3, no banned letters.

""COBIA"" is invalid because it has B and I, but also has B twice. ""COBIA"" has O(2), A(3), C(1), B(4), I(5). But B and I are allowed, but we need to check if any letters are banned. B is not banned, I is not banned. However, ""COBIA"" is a valid word but might not be optimal for information gain.

A better choice might be ""COBRA"" but R is banned. ""COBRA"" is invalid. ""COBIA"" seems the closest valid word, but let me think of others.

""COBIA"" seems acceptable, but let me try ""COBIA"" first.

Wait, let me think of ""COBIA"" again: C O B I A. It has O in 2, A in 5, but we know A must be in 3. So ""COBIA"" is invalid because A is in 5, not 3.

I need to construct a word with O in 2, A in 3. So pattern _ O A _ _

Possible words:
- ""BOAGH"" – but G and H are allowed, but not common.
- ""FOCAL"" – O(2), A(3), F(1), C(4), L(5). F, C, L are allowed.
- ""HOAGY"" – Y is banned.
- ""LOAMY"" – Y is banned.
- ""NOACK"" – K is allowed, but C is allowed, but ""NOACK"" has N(1), O(2), A(3), C(4), K(5). This seems valid.

""NOACK"" is a valid word meaning a type of axe handle, and uses N, O, A, C, K. None of these letters are banned except C and K haven't been tested yet. This seems like a good next guess to test N, C, K.

Alternatively, ""FOCAL"" is also valid and tests F, C, L.

Between these, ""NOACK"" seems slightly better as it tests N, C, K which are all new.

Let me go with ""NOACK"".

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any letters, so we can quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains five of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeats. This will give us maximum information about which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-)  – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E.
- Does contain A and O, but A cannot be in slot 1 and O cannot be in slot 3.

Letters we can now eliminate: R, S, E  
Letters we know are present: A, O  
Positions to avoid for A: 1  
Positions to avoid for O: 3  

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and O somewhere (but not in the forbidden positions).
- Avoids R, S, E entirely.
- Uses only remaining common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (besides A and O already known).

Let’s try a word that places A in position 2 or later and O in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and uses new common letters.

A good candidate is ""TOADY"":
- T (new letter)
- O (allowed in position 2)
- A (allowed in position 3)
- D (new letter)
- Y (new letter)

This uses O and A in new positions and introduces three new common letters (T, D, Y) to gain more information.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: toady -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) A(✓) D(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, T, D, Y
2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - O is in position 2 (from Guess 2: O(✓) in slot 2)
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from Guess 1: A(-)) and also NOT in position 3 (from Guess 2: A(✓) in slot 3 is actually correct, so A is in position 3). Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.

Guess 2: toady -> T(x) O(✓) A(✓) D(x) Y(x)
- O(✓) means O is in the word and in the correct position, which is slot 2.
- A(✓) means A is in the word and in the correct position, which is slot 3.

So the pattern so far is:
_ O A _ _

Letters known to be in the word and their positions:
- O in slot 2
- A in slot 3

Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, S, E, T, D, Y

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Has A in position 3
- Does NOT contain R, S, E, T, D, Y
- Uses only the remaining letters

Remaining common letters (excluding the banned ones): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need two more letters (positions 1, 4, 5) from these remaining ones. To maximize information, let's pick common letters that haven't been tested yet. Good candidates are B, C, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, U.

Let's try to form a word with these constraints. One common word that fits is ""COBIA"" but it has B and I which are allowed, but also has a second B which might not be optimal. Another is ""FOCAL"" but L is allowed. Let me think of a word with O in 2, A in 3, no banned letters.

""COBIA"" is invalid because it has B and I, but also has B twice. ""COBIA"" has O(2), A(3), C(1), B(4), I(5). But B and I are allowed, but we need to check if any letters are banned. B is not banned, I is not banned. However, ""COBIA"" is a valid word but might not be optimal for information gain.

A better choice might be ""COBRA"" but R is banned. ""COBRA"" is invalid. ""COBIA"" seems the closest valid word, but let me think of others.

""COBIA"" seems acceptable, but let me try ""COBIA"" first.

Wait, let me think of ""COBIA"" again: C O B I A. It has O in 2, A in 5, but we know A must be in 3. So ""COBIA"" is invalid because A is in 5, not 3.

I need to construct a word with O in 2, A in 3. So pattern _ O A _ _

Possible words:
- ""BOAGH"" – but G and H are allowed, but not common.
- ""FOCAL"" – O(2), A(3), F(1), C(4), L(5). F, C, L are allowed.
- ""HOAGY"" – Y is banned.
- ""LOAMY"" – Y is banned.
- ""NOACK"" – K is allowed, but C is allowed, but ""NOACK"" has N(1), O(2), A(3), C(4), K(5). This seems valid.

""NOACK"" is a valid word meaning a type of axe handle, and uses N, O, A, C, K. None of these letters are banned except C and K haven't been tested yet. This seems like a good next guess to test N, C, K.

Alternatively, ""FOCAL"" is also valid and tests F, C, L.

Between these, ""NOACK"" seems slightly better as it tests N, C, K which are all new.

Let me go with ""NOACK"".

From the three guesses we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, T, D, Y, N, C
2. Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
   - O is in position 2 (from Guess 2: O(✓) and confirmed in Guess 3)
   - A is in position 3 (from Guess 2: A(✓) and confirmed in Guess 3)
   - K is in the word but NOT in position 5 (from Guess 3: K(-))

So the pattern is: _ O A _ _ and the word must contain K somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but not 5, so positions 1 or 4).

Remaining available letters (excluding banned ones): B, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need two more letters to fill positions 1 and 4/5, with K appearing once in 1 or 4.

Possible combinations:
- Position 1: K or any other allowed letter
- Position 4: K or any other allowed letter (but K can't be in 5)

Let's try to form valid words:
- K O A _ _: KOALA (but L and A are allowed, but A is already in position 3)
- _ O A K _: FOAK? (invalid), HOAG? (invalid), LOAK? (invalid), MOAK? (invalid), POAK? (invalid), BOAK? (invalid)
- _ O A _ K: but K can't be in 5 (from feedback), so this is invalid
- _ O A _ _: need to find words with K in 1 or 4

Looking at possible words:
- ""BOAGH"" – invalid, G and H not sure
- ""FOCAL"" – invalid, C banned
- ""HOAGY"" – invalid, Y banned
- ""KOALA"" – valid, but L is allowed, A is already in position 3
- ""LOAMY"" – invalid, Y banned
- ""POAKY"" – invalid, Y banned

Actually, ""KOALA"" fits: K O A L A. It has:
- K in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 2 (correct)
- A in position 3 (correct)
- L in position 4 (new letter)
- A in position 5 (but A is already known to be in position 3, and can appear again)

But ""KOALA"" has A in both 3 and 5, which is possible.

Another option is ""HOAGY"" but Y is banned. ""VOGAL"" – invalid, G and L, but V is allowed.

Wait, let's think systematically:
We need _ O A _ _ with K in 1 or 4, and no banned letters.

Possible:
- K O A _ _: KOALA (L allowed, but A is already in 3)
- _ O A K _: need a letter in 1 and 5, with K in 4
  - B O A K ? – B, K, O, A, ? – need a valid word
  - F O A K ? – FOAK? (invalid)
  - H O A K ? – HOAK? (invalid)
  - L O A K ? – LOAK? (invalid)
  - M O A K ? – MOAK? (invalid)
  - P O A K ? – POAK? (invalid)
  - V O A K ? – VOAK? (invalid)

It seems ""KOALA"" is the most promising valid word fitting all constraints.

Let me verify:
- K is allowed in position 1 (not tested yet)
- O is correct in position 2
- A is correct in position 3
- L is allowed in position 4
- A is allowed in position 5 (even though A is already in 3, duplicates are possible)

Thus, ""KOALA"" seems like the best next guess.
