### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""RAISE"". 

""SLATE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-) : S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L(x) : L is not in the word at all.
- A(x) : A is not in the word at all.
- T(-) : T is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 4).
- E(x) : E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains S and T, but not L, A, E.
- S is not in position 1, T is not in position 4.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S and T (since they are confirmed in the word).
2. Does not use L, A, or E.
3. Has S not in position 1 and T not in position 4.

Possible letters left (excluding L, A, E): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess would test new common consonants and vowels. Since we know S and T are present, and we haven't tested I, O, or U yet, let's try a word that uses S and T plus these new vowels. Also, we should avoid positions where S and T are currently placed.

Let's try ""STORM"":
- S in position 1 (but we know S is not in position 1 from feedback), so this is bad.
Next, ""ROUST"":
- R, O, U, S, T.
- S is in position 4 (not position 1, so possible).
- T is in position 5 (not position 4, so possible).
- Uses new letters R, O, U.
- Doesn't use L, A, E.
This seems good.

Another option is ""STOIC"":
- S, T, O, I, C.
- S in position 1 (bad, from feedback).
""TRUST"":
- T, R, U, S, T.
- T in position 1 (possible), S in position 4 (possible), but has double T which might not be optimal.

""ROUST"" seems the best among these.

U(-)  → U is in the word but not in position 3  
S(-)  → S is in the word but not in position 4  
T(-)  → T is in the word but not in position 5  

So far we know:

Letters that ARE in the word (and their confirmed positions or exclusions):
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- R is in the word but not position 1
- U is in the word but not position 3
- S is in the word but not position 4
- T is in the word but not position 5

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- L, A, E (from SLATE)
- (no new exclusions from ROUST)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Contains R, U, S, T in some positions other than their excluded spots.
3. Does not contain L, A, E.

Let’s list the positions:

1  2  3  4  5
_  O  _  _  _

We need to place R, U, S, T into positions 1, 3, 4, 5, respecting their exclusions:
- R cannot be in position 1 → must be in 3,4,5
- U cannot be in position 3 → must be in 1,4,5
- S cannot be in position 4 → must be in 1,3,5
- T cannot be in position 5 → must be in 1,3,4

Let’s try to construct a valid word:

Option 1: Try T in position 1 (since it’s allowed for T)
T O _ _ _

Now we need to place R, U, S in positions 3,4,5 with constraints:
- R not in 1 (already T in 1)
- U not in 3
- S not in 4
- T already used in 1

Possible permutations of R,U,S in 3,4,5:
- 3: R, U, S
- 4: U, S, R
- 5: S, R, U

Check which permutation satisfies constraints:
1. R in 3: allowed (not position 1)
2. U in 4: allowed (not position 3)
3. S in 5: allowed (not position 4)

This gives: T O R U S

Check:
- T in 1 (allowed)
- O in 2 (correct)
- R in 3 (allowed)
- U in 4 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)

Also, no forbidden letters (L,A,E) are used.
