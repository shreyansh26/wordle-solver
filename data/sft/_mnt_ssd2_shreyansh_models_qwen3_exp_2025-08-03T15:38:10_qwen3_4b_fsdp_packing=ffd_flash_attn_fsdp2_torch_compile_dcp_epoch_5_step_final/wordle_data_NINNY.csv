### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A good starting word should also avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters. 

Some popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's a balanced word with common letters that can help narrow down possibilities quickly.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word (each got an “x”).  
That means the word we’re looking for contains none of those letters.

Good candidates would avoid S, L, A, T, E entirely.

1. Contains N in the 4th position.
2. Uses only letters that have not been eliminated (i.e., not S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D).
3. Tests new common letters to maximize information.

Available letters (excluding the eliminated ones):

Popular consonants still available: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, W, Y  
Vowels still available: I (since A, E, O, U are out)

A good strategy is to pick a word that introduces several new consonants and possibly the remaining vowel I.  
Candidate words:
- BINGO – but O is eliminated.
- CHINK – uses C, H, I, N, K (all still allowed).
- HINGE – but E is eliminated.
- PINKY – uses P, I, N, K, Y (all still allowed).
- WINKY – uses W, I, N, K, Y (all still allowed).

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A good starting word should also avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters. 

Some popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's a balanced word with common letters that can help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word (each got an “x”).  
That means the word we’re looking for contains none of those letters.  
To maximize information in the second guess, I should pick a word that uses entirely different letters, ideally including some of the most common consonants and vowels that weren’t ruled out.  
Good candidates would avoid S, L, A, T, E entirely.  
Popular choices in this situation include:  
- CRISP (but P is less common)  
- ROUND (uses O, U, N, D)  
- CHORD (uses C, H, O, R, D)  
- MURKY (uses M, U, R, K, Y)  

I’ll go with “ROUND” because it tests the vowels O and U, plus the consonants R, N, D, none of which were in SLATE.

We now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D  
- Letter confirmed in the word: N in the 4th position.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains N in the 4th position.
2. Uses only letters that have not been eliminated (i.e., not S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D).
3. Tests new common letters to maximize information.

Available letters (excluding the eliminated ones):  
B C F G H I J K M P Q V W X Y Z plus the already-known N in position 4.

Popular consonants still available: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, W, Y  
Vowels still available: I (since A, E, O, U are out)

A good strategy is to pick a word that introduces several new consonants and possibly the remaining vowel I.  
Candidate words:
- BINGO – but O is eliminated.
- CHINK – uses C, H, I, N, K (all still allowed).
- HINGE – but E is eliminated.
- PINKY – uses P, I, N, K, Y (all still allowed).
- WINKY – uses W, I, N, K, Y (all still allowed).

I’ll choose “CHINK” because it tests C, H, I, N, K – covering common letters and the remaining vowel I.

(If N is in position 4, CHINK would be C H I N K, satisfying the constraints.)

We now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D  
- Letter confirmed in the word: N in the 4th position.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains N in the 4th position.
2. Uses only letters that have not been eliminated (i.e., not S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D).
3. Tests new common letters to maximize information.

Available letters (excluding the eliminated ones):  
B C F G H I J K M P Q V W X Y Z plus the already-known N in position 4.

Popular consonants still available: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, W, Y  
Vowels still available: I (since A, E, O, U are out)

A good strategy is to pick a word that introduces several new consonants and possibly the remaining vowel I.  
Candidate words:
- BINGO – but O is eliminated.
- CHINK – uses C, H, I, N, K (all still allowed).
- HINGE – but E is eliminated.
- PINKY – uses P, I, N, K, Y (all still allowed).
- WINKY – uses W, I, N, K, Y (all still allowed).

I’ll choose “CHINK” because it tests C, H, I, N, K – covering common letters and the remaining vowel I.

(If N is in position 4, CHINK would be C H I N K, satisfying the constraints.)

Current constraints:
- Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D, C, H, K  
- Letter confirmed in position 4: N  
- Letter I is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Available letters (not yet eliminated and not used in CHINK):  
B, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the already-known N in position 4 and the letter I somewhere else.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has N in position 4.
2. Contains the letter I somewhere (but not position 3).
3. Uses only the remaining available letters.

Possible positions for I: 1, 2, or 5 (since 3 is excluded).

Candidate words:
- BINGO – but O is eliminated.
- FINGY – uses F, I, N, G, Y (all allowed). I is in position 2.
- MINGO – O is eliminated.
- PINGY – uses P, I, N, G, Y (all allowed). I is in position 2.
- VINGE – E is eliminated.
- WINGY – uses W, I, N, G, Y (all allowed). I is in position 2.

I’ll choose “FINGY” as it tests F, I, N, G, Y and places I in position 2, which is allowed.

(Note: If N is fixed at position 4 and I must appear somewhere else, FINGY satisfies these constraints.)

Current constraints:
- Letters ruled out entirely: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D, C, H, K, F, G  
- Letters confirmed:  
  – N in position 4  
  – I in position 2  
  – Y in position 5  
- So the pattern is: _ I N N N Y?  (but N is already fixed at position 4, so the word must be _ I _ N Y)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has the form: ? I ? N Y (positions 2,4,5 fixed as I, N, Y)
2. Uses only letters not yet eliminated: B, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z plus the confirmed letters.

Possible first letters: B, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Possible third letters: same list (but not N, already used)

Candidate words:
- BINGY – but G is eliminated.
- JINNY – uses J, N, Y (N already confirmed, Y confirmed). J is allowed.
- MINNY – uses M, N, Y. M is allowed.
- PINKY – but K is eliminated.
- VINNY – uses V, N, Y. V is allowed.
- WINGY – but G is eliminated.

""JINNY"" fits perfectly:
- J (position 1) – allowed
- I (position 2) – confirmed
- N (position 3) – allowed (N is confirmed in word, but not necessarily only at position 4)
- N (position 4) – confirmed
- Y (position 5) – confirmed

Actually, the pattern is _ I _ N Y, so JINNY would be J I N N Y, which matches the required pattern.

Similarly, MINNY would be M I N N Y, and VINNY would be V I N N Y.

I’ll choose ""JINNY"" as it uses J, which hasn't been tested yet.
