For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Another strong option would be ""SLATE"" or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better balanced. I'll go with that.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- S is in the correct position (5th letter).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in S and has an E somewhere in positions 1-4, but not at position 5.  
Letters we can rule out: A, R, O.  
Letters we know are in: S (position 5), E (somewhere else).

Next, I want a word that:
1. Ends in S.
2. Contains E in one of the first four positions.
3. Uses new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Good consonants to test now: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out).

I’ll try a word like “TENSE” – it ends in S, has E in position 2, and introduces T, N, E (but E is already known).  
Another option is “ELBOW” – but that doesn’t end in S.  
“HEIST” – ends in S, has E in position 2, and introduces H, I, T.  
But “HEIST” has I, which is a new vowel.  
Let me go with “HEIST” as it tests H, E, I, S, T – and S is already known at position 5.

Wait, but “HEIST” has S in position 4, but we know S must be in position 5.  
So that’s invalid.  

Correct approach: must have S in position 5.  
So I need a word like _ _ _ _ S, with E somewhere in positions 1-4.

Good candidates:
- “STEEL” – but has E in position 4, and double E might be unlikely.
- “BESET” – but S is in position 3, not 5.
- “THESE” – has E in position 4, S in 5.  
  Letters: T, H, E, S, E – tests T, H, E, S.  
  Seems good.

Another: “LEASE” – but A is ruled out.  
“PEELS” – P, E, E, L, S – but double E.  
“WEENS” – W, E, E, N, S – also double E.  
“THESE” seems cleaner.

I’ll go with “THESE”.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
   - S is fixed in the 5th position.
   - E exists somewhere in the word but not in position 5.

2. these → T(-) H(x) E(✓) S(✓) E(-)
   - S is still ✓ in position 5.
   - E is now confirmed in position 3 (E✓).
   - T is in the word but not in position 1.
   - H is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ E _ S
- Contains T somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (but 3 is E), so T must be in position 2.
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, H.
- Letters we have: E (position 3), S (position 5), T (position 2).

This gives us the pattern: _ T E _ S.

We need a 5-letter word matching _ T E _ S, using letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, O, H).

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Possible vowels left: I, U (E is already used).

Let’s think of words fitting _ T E _ S:
- B T E _ S → ""BTEIS"" – not a valid word.
- C T E _ S → ""CTE"" – no.
- D T E _ S → ""DTE"" – no.
- F T E _ S → ""FTES"" – no.
- G T E _ S → ""GTE"" – no.
- L T E _ S → ""LTE"" – no.
- M T E _ S → ""MTE"" – no.
- N T E _ S → ""NTE"" – no.
- P T E _ S → ""PTE"" – no.
- V T E _ S → ""VTE"" – no.
- W T E _ S → ""WTE"" – no.
- Y T E _ S → ""YTE"" – no.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the first letter is a vowel or another consonant, and the fourth letter is a vowel (I or U).

Looking for valid words:
- ""T"" is in position 2, so the word is _ T E _ S.
- Possible words: ""STEWS"" – but S is already in position 5, and we can't have S in position 2.
- ""ETE"" – too short.
- ""BETES"" – plural of bete, but uncommon.
- ""CETES"" – plural of cetes (plural of ceti, obsolete).
- ""DITES"" – plural of dite (archaic).
- ""FETES"" – plural of fete (French, but used in English).
- ""GITES"" – plural of gite (French for hut).
- ""LITES"" – plural of lite (not a common noun).
- ""MITES"" – plural ofmite (a small coin).
- ""PITES"" – not a word.
- ""WITES"" – plural of white (but starts with W).
- ""YITES"" – not a word.

The most common valid word fitting _ T E _ S seems to be ""FETES"" (plural of fete), but it's a bit obscure. Another is ""GITES"". However, let me check if there's a more common word.

Looking again, ""T"" in position 2 and E in position 3, S in 5:
- ""STEWS"" – but S would be in position 2, which conflicts with S being in position 5.
- ""ETUIS"" – but E is in position 1, T in 2, U in 3, I in 4, S in 5. This fits _ T E _ S? No, E is in position 1 here, not 3.
- ""ETUIS"" is E T U I S – but we know E must be in position 3.

Wait, the pattern is _ T E _ S. So positions: 1: ?, 2: T, 3: E, 4: ?, 5: S.

Valid words:
- ""BETES"" – B E T E S – but E is in position 3 here, T in 2, S in 5. This fits! But BETES is plural of bete, which is acceptable in Scrabble lists.
- ""CETES"" – C E T E S
- ""DITES"" – D I T E S
- ""FETES"" – F E T E S
- ""GITES"" – G I T E S
- ""LITES"" – L I T E S
- ""MITES"" – M I T E S

Among these, ""DITES"" seems the most common (as in ""dites pieds"" in French, but in English it's not standard). ""FETES"" is more recognizable. However, let me think if there's a better fit.

Actually, ""ETUIS"" is E T U I S, but E is in position 1, not 3. So that's invalid.

The correct pattern is _ T E _ S. The best common word seems to be ""FETES"" (though obscure), but let me check if there's a more common word.

Another possibility: ""T"" in position 2, E in position 3, S in 5, and the first and fourth letters from remaining consonants/vowels.

Looking at remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, I, U.

Possible words:
- ""BETES"" – B E T E S
- ""CETES"" – C E T E S
- ""DITES"" – D I T E S
- ""FETES"" – F E T E S
- ""GITES"" – G I T E S
- ""LITES"" – L I T E S
- ""MITES"" – M I T E S

""FETES"" seems the most plausible, even if a bit common. Alternatively, ""GITES"" or ""BETES"".

But let me think if there's a word with a different first letter. For example, ""NITES"" – but N is a consonant, I is vowel.

""NITES"" – N I T E S – fits _ T E _ S? No, T is in position 2, E in 3, S in 5, so N I T E S would be N I T E S – but T is in position 3 here, not 2. So that's invalid.

Wait, the pattern is _ T E _ S, so positions:
1: ?
2: T
3: E
4: ?
5: S

Thus, the word is [1][T][E][4][S].

Valid words:
- BETES – B E T E S
- CETES – C E T E S
- DITES – D I T E S
- FETES – F E T E S
- GITES – G I T E S
- LITES – L I T E S
- MITES – M I T E S

Among these, ""FETES"" is the most common, so I'll go with that.

But let me double-check: is there any other word? ""ETUIS"" is invalid as E is in position 1. ""T"" must be in position 2.

Yes, ""FETES"" seems correct.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- Pattern: _ T E _ S (T in position 2, E in position 3, S in position 5)
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, H

The only common English word fitting this pattern is ""FETES"" (plural of fete).

<guess>fetes</guess>",fetes,"From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
   - S is fixed in the 5th position.
   - E exists somewhere in the word but not in position 5.

2. these → T(-) H(x) E(✓) S(✓) E(-)
   - S is still ✓ in position 5.
   - E is now confirmed in position 3 (E✓).
   - T is in the word but not in position 1.
   - H is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ E _ S
- Contains T somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (but 3 is E), so T must be in position 2.
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, H.
- Letters we have: E (position 3), S (position 5), T (position 2).

This gives us the pattern: _ T E _ S.

We need a 5-letter word matching _ T E _ S, using letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, O, H).

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Possible vowels left: I, U (E is already used).

Let’s think of words fitting _ T E _ S:
- B T E _ S → ""BTEIS"" – not a valid word.
- C T E _ S → ""CTE"" – no.
- D T E _ S → ""DTE"" – no.
- F T E _ S → ""FTES"" – no.
- G T E _ S → ""GTE"" – no.
- L T E _ S → ""LTE"" – no.
- M T E _ S → ""MTE"" – no.
- N T E _ S → ""NTE"" – no.
- P T E _ S → ""PTE"" – no.
- V T E _ S → ""VTE"" – no.
- W T E _ S → ""WTE"" – no.
- Y T E _ S → ""YTE"" – no.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the first letter is a vowel or another consonant, and the fourth letter is a vowel (I or U).

Looking for valid words:
- ""T"" is in position 2, so the word is _ T E _ S.
- Possible words: ""STEWS"" – but S is already in position 5, and we can't have S in position 2.
- ""ETE"" – too short.
- ""BETES"" – plural of bete, but uncommon.
- ""CETES"" – plural of cetes (plural of ceti, obsolete).
- ""DITES"" – plural of dite (archaic).
- ""FETES"" – plural of fete (French, but used in English).
- ""GITES"" – plural of gite (French for hut).
- ""LITES"" – plural of lite (not a common noun).
- ""MITES"" – plural ofmite (a small coin).
- ""PITES"" – not a word.
- ""WITES"" – plural of white (but starts with W).
- ""YITES"" – not a word.

The most common valid word fitting _ T E _ S seems to be ""FETES"" (plural of fete), but it's a bit obscure. Another is ""GITES"". However, let me check if there's a more common word.

Looking again, ""T"" in position 2 and E in position 3, S in 5:
- ""STEWS"" – but S would be in position 2, which conflicts with S being in position 5.
- ""ETUIS"" – but E is in position 1, T in 2, U in 3, I in 4, S in 5. This fits _ T E _ S? No, E is in position 1 here, not 3.
- ""ETUIS"" is E T U I S – but we know E must be in position 3.

Wait, the pattern is _ T E _ S. So positions: 1: ?, 2: T, 3: E, 4: ?, 5: S.

Valid words:
- ""BETES"" – B E T E S – but E is in position 3 here, T in 2, S in 5. This fits! But BETES is plural of bete, which is acceptable in Scrabble lists.
- ""CETES"" – C E T E S
- ""DITES"" – D I T E S
- ""FETES"" – F E T E S
- ""GITES"" – G I T E S
- ""LITES"" – L I T E S
- ""MITES"" – M I T E S

Among these, ""DITES"" seems the most common (as in ""dites pieds"" in French, but in English it's not standard). ""FETES"" is more recognizable. However, let me think if there's a better fit.

Actually, ""ETUIS"" is E T U I S, but E is in position 1, not 3. So that's invalid.

The correct pattern is _ T E _ S. The best common word seems to be ""FETES"" (though obscure), but let me check if there's a more common word.

Another possibility: ""T"" in position 2, E in position 3, S in 5, and the first and fourth letters from remaining consonants/vowels.

Looking at remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, I, U.

Possible words:
- ""BETES"" – B E T E S
- ""CETES"" – C E T E S

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Another strong option would be ""SLATE"" or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better balanced. I'll go with that.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- S is in the correct position (5th letter).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in S and has an E somewhere in positions 1-4, but not at position 5.  
Letters we can rule out: A, R, O.  
Letters we know are in: S (position 5), E (somewhere else).

Next, I want a word that:
1. Ends in S.
2. Contains E in one of the first four positions.
3. Uses new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Good consonants to test now: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out).

I’ll try a word like “TENSE” – it ends in S, has E in position 2, and introduces T, N, E (but E is already known).  
Another option is “ELBOW” – but that doesn’t end in S.  
“HEIST” – ends in S, has E in position 2, and introduces H, I, T.  
But “HEIST” has I, which is a new vowel.  
Let me go with “HEIST” as it tests H, E, I, S, T – and S is already known at position 5.

Wait, but “HEIST” has S in position 4, but we know S must be in position 5.  
So that’s invalid.  

Correct approach: must have S in position 5.  
So I need a word like _ _ _ _ S, with E somewhere in positions 1-4.

Good candidates:
- “STEEL” – but has E in position 4, and double E might be unlikely.
- “BESET” – but S is in position 3, not 5.
- “THESE” – has E in position 4, S in 5.  
  Letters: T, H, E, S, E – tests T, H, E, S.  
  Seems good.

Another: “LEASE” – but A is ruled out.  
“PEELS” – P, E, E, L, S – but double E.  
“WEENS” – W, E, E, N, S – also double E.  
“THESE” seems cleaner.

I’ll go with “THESE”.

Summary of constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ E _ S (positions 3 and 5 fixed as E and S)
- T must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4 (but not where it was already ruled out)
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, H, F

We need a 5-letter word with:

- No A, R, O, H, F

Possible positions for T:
- Position 1: T _ E _ S
- Position 2: _ T E _ S
- Position 4: _ _ E T S

Let’s look for valid English words in each case.

1. T _ E _ S:
   - TWEES – but W is allowed, E is in position 3, S in 5. This fits and uses T in position 1.

2. _ T E _ S:

   - C T E _ S – no common word.
   - DITES – D I T E S – T in position 3, but we know T must be in position 2 here, so invalid.
   - LITES – L I T E S – T in position 3, invalid for this pattern.

3. _ _ E T S:

   - M E E T S – same issue.
   - P E E T S – same issue.
   - V E E T S – same issue.
   - W E E T S – same issue.

The only valid common word in the _ T E _ S pattern is BETES, but BETES uses B (which is allowed) and fits all constraints.

But let’s check TWEES (T _ E _ S):
- T W E E S – E is in position 3, S in 5, T in 1. This seems valid.

Between BETES and TWEES, BETES is more likely to be the intended word.

However, let’s verify BETES:
- B E T E S:
  - B: allowed (not ruled out)
  - E: in position 3 (correct)
  - T: in position 2 (allowed, not ruled out)
  - E: in position 4 (allowed, not ruled out)
  - S: in position 5 (correct)

This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be BETES.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Another strong option would be ""SLATE"" or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better balanced. I'll go with that.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- S is in the correct position (5th letter).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in S and has an E somewhere in positions 1-4, but not at position 5.  
Letters we can rule out: A, R, O.  
Letters we know are in: S (position 5), E (somewhere else).

Next, I want a word that:
1. Ends in S.
2. Contains E in one of the first four positions.
3. Uses new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Good consonants to test now: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out).

I’ll try a word like “TENSE” – it ends in S, has E in position 2, and introduces T, N, E (but E is already known).  
Another option is “ELBOW” – but that doesn’t end in S.  
“HEIST” – ends in S, has E in position 2, and introduces H, I, T.  
But “HEIST” has I, which is a new vowel.  
Let me go with “HEIST” as it tests H, E, I, S, T – and S is already known at position 5.

Wait, but “HEIST” has S in position 4, but we know S must be in position 5.  
So that’s invalid.  

Correct approach: must have S in position 5.  
So I need a word like _ _ _ _ S, with E somewhere in positions 1-4.

Good candidates:
- “STEEL” – but has E in position 4, and double E might be unlikely.
- “BESET” – but S is in position 3, not 5.
- “THESE” – has E in position 4, S in 5.  
  Letters: T, H, E, S, E – tests T, H, E, S.  
  Seems good.

Another: “LEASE” – but A is ruled out.  
“PEELS” – P, E, E, L, S – but double E.  
“WEENS” – W, E, E, N, S – also double E.  
“THESE” seems cleaner.

I’ll go with “THESE”.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: these -> FEEDBACK: T(-) H(x) E(✓) S(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
   - S is fixed in the 5th position.
   - E exists somewhere in the word but not in position 5.

2. these → T(-) H(x) E(✓) S(✓) E(-)
   - S is still ✓ in position 5.
   - E is now confirmed in position 3 (E✓).
   - T is in the word but not in position 1.
   - H is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ E _ S
- Contains T somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (but 3 is E), so T must be in position 2.
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, H.
- Letters we have: E (position 3), S (position 5), T (position 2).

This gives us the pattern: _ T E _ S.

We need a 5-letter word matching _ T E _ S, using letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, O, H).

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Possible vowels left: I, U (E is already used).

Let’s think of words fitting _ T E _ S:
- B T E _ S → ""BTEIS"" – not a valid word.
- C T E _ S → ""CTE"" – no.
- D T E _ S → ""DTE"" – no.
- F T E _ S → ""FTES"" – no.
- G T E _ S → ""GTE"" – no.
- L T E _ S → ""LTE"" – no.
- M T E _ S → ""MTE"" – no.
- N T E _ S → ""NTE"" – no.
- P T E _ S → ""PTE"" – no.
- V T E _ S → ""VTE"" – no.
- W T E _ S → ""WTE"" – no.
- Y T E _ S → ""YTE"" – no.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the first letter is a vowel or another consonant, and the fourth letter is a vowel (I or U).

Looking for valid words:
- ""T"" is in position 2, so the word is _ T E _ S.
- Possible words: ""STEWS"" – but S is already in position 5, and we can't have S in position 2.
- ""ETE"" – too short.
- ""BETES"" – plural of bete, but uncommon.
- ""CETES"" – plural of cetes (plural of ceti, obsolete).
- ""DITES"" – plural of dite (archaic).
- ""FETES"" – plural of fete (French, but used in English).
- ""GITES"" – plural of gite (French for hut).
- ""LITES"" – plural of lite (not a common noun).
- ""MITES"" – plural ofmite (a small coin).
- ""PITES"" – not a word.
- ""WITES"" – plural of white (but starts with W).
- ""YITES"" – not a word.

The most common valid word fitting _ T E _ S seems to be ""FETES"" (plural of fete), but it's a bit obscure. Another is ""GITES"". However, let me check if there's a more common word.

Looking again, ""T"" in position 2 and E in position 3, S in 5:
- ""STEWS"" – but S would be in position 2, which conflicts with S being in position 5.
- ""ETUIS"" – but E is in position 1, T in 2, U in 3, I in 4, S in 5. This fits _ T E _ S? No, E is in position 1 here, not 3.
- ""ETUIS"" is E T U I S – but we know E must be in position 3.

Wait, the pattern is _ T E _ S. So positions: 1: ?, 2: T, 3: E, 4: ?, 5: S.

Valid words:
- ""BETES"" – B E T E S – but E is in position 3 here, T in 2, S in 5. This fits! But BETES is plural of bete, which is acceptable in Scrabble lists.
- ""CETES"" – C E T E S
- ""DITES"" – D I T E S
- ""FETES"" – F E T E S
- ""GITES"" – G I T E S
- ""LITES"" – L I T E S
- ""MITES"" – M I T E S

Among these, ""DITES"" seems the most common (as in ""dites pieds"" in French, but in English it's not standard). ""FETES"" is more recognizable. However, let me think if there's a better fit.

Actually, ""ETUIS"" is E T U I S, but E is in position 1, not 3. So that's invalid.

The correct pattern is _ T E _ S. The best common word seems to be ""FETES"" (though obscure), but let me check if there's a more common word.

Another possibility: ""T"" in position 2, E in position 3, S in 5, and the first and fourth letters from remaining consonants/vowels.

Looking at remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, I, U.

Possible words:
- ""BETES"" – B E T E S
- ""CETES"" – C E T E S
- ""DITES"" – D I T E S
- ""FETES"" – F E T E S
- ""GITES"" – G I T E S
- ""LITES"" – L I T E S
- ""MITES"" – M I T E S

""FETES"" seems the most plausible, even if a bit common. Alternatively, ""GITES"" or ""BETES"".

But let me think if there's a word with a different first letter. For example, ""NITES"" – but N is a consonant, I is vowel.

""NITES"" – N I T E S – fits _ T E _ S? No, T is in position 2, E in 3, S in 5, so N I T E S would be N I T E S – but T is in position 3 here, not 2. So that's invalid.

Wait, the pattern is _ T E _ S, so positions:
1: ?
2: T
3: E
4: ?
5: S

Thus, the word is [1][T][E][4][S].

Valid words:
- BETES – B E T E S
- CETES – C E T E S
- DITES – D I T E S
- FETES – F E T E S
- GITES – G I T E S
- LITES – L I T E S
- MITES – M I T E S

Among these, ""FETES"" is the most common, so I'll go with that.

But let me double-check: is there any other word? ""ETUIS"" is invalid as E is in position 1. ""T"" must be in position 2.

Yes, ""FETES"" seems correct.Based on the feedback:
- Pattern: _ T E _ S (T in position 2, E in position 3, S in position 5)
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, H

The only common English word fitting this pattern is ""FETES"" (plural of fete).

Summary of constraints:

- T must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4 (but not where it was already ruled out)
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, H, F

Possible positions for T:
- Position 1: T _ E _ S
- Position 2: _ T E _ S
- Position 4: _ _ E T S

Let’s look for valid English words in each case.

1. T _ E _ S:
   - TWEES – but W is allowed, E is in position 3, S in 5. This fits and uses T in position 1.

2. _ T E _ S:

   - C T E _ S – no common word.
   - DITES – D I T E S – T in position 3, but we know T must be in position 2 here, so invalid.
   - LITES – L I T E S – T in position 3, invalid for this pattern.

3. _ _ E T S:
   - B E E T S – but E is already in position 3, can’t have two E’s.
   - C E E T S – same issue.
   - M E E T S – same issue.
   - P E E T S – same issue.
   - V E E T S – same issue.
   - W E E T S – same issue.

The only valid common word in the _ T E _ S pattern is BETES, but BETES uses B (which is allowed) and fits all constraints.

But let’s check TWEES (T _ E _ S):
- T W E E S – E is in position 3, S in 5, T in 1. This seems valid.

Between BETES and TWEES, BETES is more likely to be the intended word.

However, let’s verify BETES:
- B E T E S:
  - B: allowed (not ruled out)
  - E: in position 3 (correct)
  - T: in position 2 (allowed, not ruled out)
  - E: in position 4 (allowed, not ruled out)
  - S: in position 5 (correct)

This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be BETES.

From the four rounds we now know:

- T must appear somewhere in the word, but not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (because it was marked “-” in positions 2 and 3 in Guess 3 and 4).  
  – In Guess 3 (fetes), T was in position 3 → “-” (wrong position).

  Therefore T cannot be in position 3.  
  It also cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (because it was “-” there in earlier guesses).

So the pattern is now: _ _ E T S

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Another strong option would be ""SLATE"" or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better balanced. I'll go with that.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- S is in the correct position (5th letter).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in S and has an E somewhere in positions 1-4, but not at position 5.  
Letters we can rule out: A, R, O.  
Letters we know are in: S (position 5), E (somewhere else).

Next, I want a word that:
1. Ends in S.
2. Contains E in one of the first four positions.
3. Uses new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Good consonants to test now: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out).

I’ll try a word like “TENSE” – it ends in S, has E in position 2, and introduces T, N, E (but E is already known).  
Another option is “ELBOW” – but that doesn’t end in S.  
“HEIST” – ends in S, has E in position 2, and introduces H, I, T.  
But “HEIST” has I, which is a new vowel.  
Let me go with “HEIST” as it tests H, E, I, S, T – and S is already known at position 5.

Wait, but “HEIST” has S in position 4, but we know S must be in position 5.  
So that’s invalid.  

Correct approach: must have S in position 5.  
So I need a word like _ _ _ _ S, with E somewhere in positions 1-4.

Good candidates:
- “STEEL” – but has E in position 4, and double E might be unlikely.
- “BESET” – but S is in position 3, not 5.
- “THESE” – has E in position 4, S in 5.  
  Letters: T, H, E, S, E – tests T, H, E, S.  
  Seems good.

Another: “LEASE” – but A is ruled out.  
“PEELS” – P, E, E, L, S – but double E.  
“WEENS” – W, E, E, N, S – also double E.  
“THESE” seems cleaner.

I’ll go with “THESE”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
   - S is fixed in the 5th position.
   - E exists somewhere in the word but not in position 5.

2. these → T(-) H(x) E(✓) S(✓) E(-)
   - S is still ✓ in position 5.
   - E is now confirmed in position 3 (E✓).
   - T is in the word but not in position 1.
   - H is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ E _ S
- Contains T somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (but 3 is E), so T must be in position 2.
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, H.
- Letters we have: E (position 3), S (position 5), T (position 2).

This gives us the pattern: _ T E _ S.

We need a 5-letter word matching _ T E _ S, using letters not yet ruled out (no A, R, O, H).

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Possible vowels left: I, U (E is already used).

Let’s think of words fitting _ T E _ S:
- B T E _ S → ""BTEIS"" – not a valid word.
- C T E _ S → ""CTE"" – no.
- D T E _ S → ""DTE"" – no.
- F T E _ S → ""FTES"" – no.
- G T E _ S → ""GTE"" – no.
- L T E _ S → ""LTE"" – no.
- M T E _ S → ""MTE"" – no.
- N T E _ S → ""NTE"" – no.
- P T E _ S → ""PTE"" – no.
- V T E _ S → ""VTE"" – no.
- W T E _ S → ""WTE"" – no.
- Y T E _ S → ""YTE"" – no.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the first letter is a vowel or another consonant, and the fourth letter is a vowel (I or U).

Looking for valid words:
- ""T"" is in position 2, so the word is _ T E _ S.
- Possible words: ""STEWS"" – but S is already in position 5, and we can't have S in position 2.
- ""ETE"" – too short.
- ""BETES"" – plural of bete, but uncommon.
- ""CETES"" – plural of cetes (plural of ceti, obsolete).
- ""DITES"" – plural of dite (archaic).
- ""FETES"" – plural of fete (French, but used in English).
- ""GITES"" – plural of gite (French for hut).
- ""LITES"" – plural of lite (not a common noun).
- ""MITES"" – plural ofmite (a small coin).
- ""PITES"" – not a word.
- ""WITES"" – plural of white (but starts with W).
- ""YITES"" – not a word.

The most common valid word fitting _ T E _ S seems to be ""FETES"" (plural of fete), but it's a bit obscure. Another is ""GITES"". However, let me check if there's a more common word.

Looking again, ""T"" in position 2 and E in position 3, S in 5:
- ""STEWS"" – but S would be in position 2, which conflicts with S being in position 5.
- ""ETUIS"" – but E is in position 1, T in 2, U in 3, I in 4, S in 5. This fits _ T E _ S? No, E is in position 1 here, not 3.
- ""ETUIS"" is E T U I S – but we know E must be in position 3.

Wait, the pattern is _ T E _ S. So positions: 1: ?, 2: T, 3: E, 4: ?, 5: S.

Valid words:
- ""BETES"" – B E T E S – but E is in position 3 here, T in 2, S in 5. This fits! But BETES is plural of bete, which is acceptable in Scrabble lists.
- ""CETES"" – C E T E S
- ""DITES"" – D I T E S
- ""FETES"" – F E T E S
- ""GITES"" – G I T E S
- ""LITES"" – L I T E S
- ""MITES"" – M I T E S

Among these, ""DITES"" seems the most common (as in ""dites pieds"" in French, but in English it's not standard). ""FETES"" is more recognizable. However, let me think if there's a better fit.

Actually, ""ETUIS"" is E T U I S, but E is in position 1, not 3. So that's invalid.

The correct pattern is _ T E _ S. The best common word seems to be ""FETES"" (though obscure), but let me check if there's a more common word.

Another possibility: ""T"" in position 2, E in position 3, S in 5, and the first and fourth letters from remaining consonants/vowels.

Looking at remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, I, U.

Possible words:
- ""BETES"" – B E T E S
- ""CETES"" – C E T E S
- ""DITES"" – D I T E S
- ""FETES"" – F E T E S
- ""GITES"" – G I T E S
- ""LITES"" – L I T E S
- ""MITES"" – M I T E S

""FETES"" seems the most plausible, even if a bit common. Alternatively, ""GITES"" or ""BETES"".

But let me think if there's a word with a different first letter. For example, ""NITES"" – but N is a consonant, I is vowel.

""NITES"" – N I T E S – fits _ T E _ S? No, T is in position 2, E in 3, S in 5, so N I T E S would be N I T E S – but T is in position 3 here, not 2. So that's invalid.

Wait, the pattern is _ T E _ S, so positions:
1: ?
2: T
3: E
4: ?
5: S

Thus, the word is [1][T][E][4][S].

Valid words:
- BETES – B E T E S
- CETES – C E T E S
- DITES – D I T E S
- FETES – F E T E S
- GITES – G I T E S
- LITES – L I T E S
- MITES – M I T E S

Among these, ""FETES"" is the most common, so I'll go with that.

But let me double-check: is there any other word? ""ETUIS"" is invalid as E is in position 1. ""T"" must be in position 2.

Yes, ""FETES"" seems correct.Based on the feedback:
- Pattern: _ T E _ S (T in position 2, E in position 3, S in position 5)
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, H

The only common English word fitting this pattern is ""FETES"" (plural of fete).

Let’s update what we now know after the three guesses.

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
   - S is fixed in position 5.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. these → T(-) H(x) E(✓) S(✓) E(-)
   - S is still ✓ in position 5.
   - E is now confirmed in position 3.
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - H is not in the word.

3. fetes → F(x) E(-) T(-) E(-) S(-)
   - F is not in the word.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 2 (it’s already confirmed in position 3, so this is consistent).
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 3 (it’s already confirmed in position 2, so this is consistent).
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4 (it’s already confirmed in position 5, so this is consistent).
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (it’s already confirmed in position 3, so this is consistent).

Summary of constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ E _ S (positions 3 and 5 fixed as E and S)
- T must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4 (but not where it was already ruled out)
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, H, F

We need a 5-letter word with:
- E in position 3
- S in position 5
- T somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4
- No A, R, O, H, F

Possible positions for T:
- Position 1: T _ E _ S
- Position 2: _ T E _ S
- Position 4: _ _ E T S

Let’s look for valid English words in each case.

1. T _ E _ S:
   - TWEES – but W is allowed, E is in position 3, S in 5. This fits and uses T in position 1.

2. _ T E _ S:
   - BETES – B is allowed, T in position 2, E in 3, S in 5.
   - C T E _ S – no common word.
   - DITES – D I T E S – T in position 3, but we know T must be in position 2 here, so invalid.
   - LITES – L I T E S – T in position 3, invalid for this pattern.

3. _ _ E T S:
   - B E E T S – but E is already in position 3, can’t have two E’s.
   - C E E T S – same issue.
   - M E E T S – same issue.
   - P E E T S – same issue.
   - V E E T S – same issue.
   - W E E T S – same issue.

The only valid common word in the _ T E _ S pattern is BETES, but BETES uses B (which is allowed) and fits all constraints.

But let’s check TWEES (T _ E _ S):
- T W E E S – E is in position 3, S in 5, T in 1. This seems valid.

Between BETES and TWEES, BETES is more likely to be the intended word.

However, let’s verify BETES:
- B E T E S:
  - B: allowed (not ruled out)
  - E: in position 3 (correct)
  - T: in position 2 (allowed, not ruled out)
  - E: in position 4 (allowed, not ruled out)
  - S: in position 5 (correct)

This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be BETES.

From the four rounds we now know:

- Position 5 is definitely S.
- Position 3 is definitely E (confirmed by Guess 2 and 3).
- T must appear somewhere in the word, but not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (because it was marked “-” in positions 2 and 3 in Guess 3 and 4).  
  – In Guess 3 (fetes), T was in position 3 → “-” (wrong position).  
  – In Guess 4 (betes), T was in position 3 again → “-”.  
  Therefore T cannot be in position 3.  
  It also cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (because it was “-” there in earlier guesses).  
  The only remaining spot for T is position 4.

So the pattern is now: _ _ E T S

Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, H, F, B.

We need a 5-letter English word that fits:
- 3rd letter = E  
- 4th letter = T  
- 5th letter = S  
- 1st and 2nd letters must be from the remaining alphabet (no A, R, O, H, F, B).

Possible consonants still allowed: C, D, G, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Possible vowels still allowed: I, U (since A and O are ruled out and E is already used).

Let’s list some common words that fit _ _ E T S:

- C E E T S – invalid (two E’s)  
- D I T E S – invalid (T in 3, not 4)  
- L I T E S – same issue  
- M I T E S – same  
- N I T E S – same  
- P I T E S – same  
- V I T E S – same  
- W I T E S – same  
- C I T E S – C I T E S (valid word, means “citizens”)  
- G I T E S – G I T E S (valid, plural of gite)  
- M I T E S – already considered  
- Y E T I S – invalid (S not at end)  

Among these, CITES and GITES are both valid. CITES is more common and uses C (not yet ruled out).

So the next guess should be CITES.

3. fetes → F(x) E(-) T(-) E(-) S(-)
   – F is not in the word.
   – T is not in position 3.

4. betes → B(x) E(-) T(-) E(-) S(-)
   – B is not in the word.

5. cites → C(x) I(x) T(-) E(-) S(-)
   – C and I are not in the word.
   – T is not in position 3 (already known).
   – E is not in position 4 (already known).

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ E _ S (positions 3 and 5 fixed as E and S)
- T must appear in the word, but cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (because it was marked “-” in positions 1, 2, and 3 across different guesses).  
  – In these five guesses, T has appeared in positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 and was always “-”.  
  – Therefore T cannot be in any of these positions.  
  – But positions 3 and 5 are already taken by E and S.  
  – This means T has **no possible position** left in the 5-letter word.

This is a contradiction. The only way to resolve it is to realize that the earlier interpretation was incomplete: the feedback symbols are per-position, not per-letter globally. Let’s re-examine the feedback more carefully.

Re-evaluating the feedback:

- Guess 1 (arose): A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
  – S is correct in position 5.
  – E is in the word but wrong position (so E exists, but not in position 5).

- Guess 2 (these): T(-) H(x) E(✓) S(✓) E(-)
  – T is in the word but wrong position (so T exists, but not in position 1).
  – E is correct in position 3.
  – S is correct in position 5.

- Guess 3 (fetes): F(x) E(-) T(-) E(-) S(-)
  – F is not in the word.
  – E is in the word but wrong position (but we already know E is in position 3, so this is consistent).
  – T is in the word but wrong position (so T exists, but not in position 3).
  – S is in the word but wrong position (but we already know S is in position 5, so this is consistent).

- Guess 4 (betes): B(x) E(-) T(-) E(-) S(-)
  – B is not in the word.
  – E is in the word but wrong position (consistent).
  – T is in the word but wrong position (so T exists, but not in position 3).
  – S is in the word but wrong position (consistent).

- Guess 5 (cites): C(x) I(x) T(-) E(-) S(-)
  – C and I are not in the word.
  – T is in the word but wrong position (so T exists, but not in position 3).
  – E is in the word but wrong position (consistent).
  – S is in the word but wrong position (consistent).

So the constraints are:
- Position 3: E (confirmed)
- Position 5: S (confirmed)
- T is in the word but not in positions 1, 3 (from these and fetes), and not in position 3 again (redundant).  
  – Therefore T can only be in position 2 or 4.

- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, H, F, B, C, I.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- E in position 3
- S in position 5
- T in position 2 or 4
- No A, R, O, H, F, B, C, I

Possible remaining consonants: D, G, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Possible remaining vowels: U (only, since A, O, I are out and E is used)

Let’s list possible patterns:

Case 1: T in position 2 → _ T E _ S
   – Possible first letters: D, G, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.
   – Possible fourth letters: U (only vowel left) or another consonant.

   Valid English words:
   – D T E U S → not a word
   – G T E U S → not a word
   – L T E U S → not a word
   – M T E U S → not a word
   – N T E U S → not a word
   – P T E U S → not a word
   – V T E U S → not a word
   – W T E U S → not a word
   – Y T E U S → not a word

   No common words fit _ T E _ S.

Case 2: T in position 4 → _ _ E T S
   – Possible first and second letters: from remaining consonants and vowels.

   Valid English words:
   – D U E T S → D U E T S (valid, informal plural of “duets”)
   – G U E T S → G U E T S (valid, plural of “gues” or “guet”)
   – L U E T S → not a word
   – M U E T S → not a word
   – N U E T S → not a word
   – P U E T S → P U E T S (valid, plural of “pues”)
   – V U E T S → not a word
   – W U E T S → not a word
   – Y U E T S → not a word

   Among these, the most common valid words are DUE T S, GUE T S, and PUE T S.  
   DUE T S is the most recognizable (though informal), so we’ll go with that.

Therefore, the next guess should be DUE T S.

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
   – S is fixed in position 5.
   – E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. these → T(-) H(x) E(✓) S(✓) E(-)
   – E is confirmed in position 3.
   – T is in the word but not in position 1.
   – S is confirmed in position 5.

   – F is not in the word.
   – T is not in position 3.

4. betes → B(x) E(-) T(-) E(-) S(-)
   – B is not in the word.

5. cites → C(x) I(x) T(-) E(-) S(-)
   – C and I are not in the word.
   – T is not in position 3 (already known).
   – E is not in position 4 (already known).

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ E _ S (positions 3 and 5 fixed as E and S)
- T must appear in the word, but cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (because it was marked “-” in positions 1, 2, and 3 across different guesses).  
  – In these five guesses, T has appeared in positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 and was always “-”.  
  – Therefore T cannot be in any of these positions.  
  – But positions 3 and 5 are already taken by E and S.  
  – This means T has **no possible position** left in the 5-letter word.

This is a contradiction. The only way to resolve it is to realize that the earlier interpretation was incomplete: the feedback symbols are per-position, not per-letter globally. Let’s re-examine the feedback more carefully.

  – E is in the word but wrong position (so E exists, but not in position 5).

- Guess 2 (these): T(-) H(x) E(✓) S(✓) E(-)
  – T is in the word but wrong position (so T exists, but not in position 1).
  – E is correct in position 3.
  – S is correct in position 5.

- Guess 3 (fetes): F(x) E(-) T(-) E(-) S(-)
  – F is not in the word.
  – E is in the word but wrong position (but we already know E is in position 3, so this is consistent).
  – T is in the word but wrong position (so T exists, but not in position 3).
  – S is in the word but wrong position (but we already know S is in position 5, so this is consistent).

- Guess 4 (betes): B(x) E(-) T(-) E(-) S(-)
  – B is not in the word.
  – E is in the word but wrong position (consistent).
  – T is in the word but wrong position (so T exists, but not in position 3).
  – S is in the word but wrong position (consistent).

- Guess 5 (cites): C(x) I(x) T(-) E(-) S(-)
  – C and I are not in the word.
  – T is in the word but wrong position (so T exists, but not in position 3).
  – E is in the word but wrong position (consistent).
  – S is in the word but wrong position (consistent).

So the constraints are:
- Position 3: E (confirmed)
- Position 5: S (confirmed)
- T is in the word but not in positions 1, 3 (from these and fetes), and not in position 3 again (redundant).  
  – Therefore T can only be in position 2 or 4.

- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, H, F, B, C, I.

We need a 5-letter word with:

Let’s list possible patterns:

Case 1: T in position 2 → _ T E _ S
   – Possible first letters: D, G, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.
   – Possible fourth letters: U (only vowel left) or another consonant.

   – P T E U S → not a word
   – V T E U S → not a word
   – W T E U S → not a word
   – Y T E U S → not a word

   No common words fit _ T E _ S.

Case 2: T in position 4 → _ _ E T S
   – Possible first and second letters: from remaining consonants and vowels.

   Valid English words:
   – D U E T S → D U E T S (valid, informal plural of “duets”)
   – G U E T S → G U E T S (valid, plural of “gues” or “guet”)
   – L U E T S → not a word

   Among these, the most common valid words are DUE T S, GUE T S, and PUE T S.  
   DUE T S is the most recognizable (though informal), so we’ll go with that.

Therefore, the next guess should be DUE T S.",Guess 6: duets -> FEEDBACK: D(x) U(✓) E(✓) T(-) S(-),FAIL
