### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, O, S are **not** in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position (✓).

So the secret word ends with E and does **not** contain A, R, O, S.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.
3. Uses other common letters (T, L, N, I, C, etc.) to maximize information.

A good candidate is “TINYE”:

From the new feedback on “tinye”:

- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 2.
- N(✓) – N is in the word and in position 3.
- Y(x) – Y is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ N _ E
- Letters definitely excluded: A, R, O, S, T, Y
- Letters that must appear somewhere: I (but not in position 2)

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has N in position 3.
2. Has E in position 5.
3. Contains I somewhere except position 2.
4. Uses only letters not in the excluded set.

Possible candidates:
- “CHINE” – but H is uncommon and C is okay, but let’s see if we can use more common letters.
- “MINCE” – M, I, N, C, E. This fits: N in 3, E in 5, I in 2 (but feedback says I is not in 2, so this is invalid).
- “PINNE” – double N, but P is okay, but double letters are less likely.
- “LINNE” – L is okay, but again double N.
- “DINER” – R is excluded.
- “VINER” – R is excluded.
- “HINER” – R is excluded.
- “MINER” – R is excluded.
- “WINCE” – W, I, N, C, E. N is in 3, E in 5, I in 2 (invalid position).
- “WINE” is 4 letters.
- “WINE” plus a letter – but we need 5.
- “CHINE” – C, H, I, N, E. N in 3, E in 5, I in 3 is invalid (N is there).
- “CINER” – R is excluded.
- “HINSE” – H, I, N, S, E. S is excluded.
- “MINHE” – H is okay, but I in 2 is invalid.
- “PINCE” – P, I, N, C, E. N in 3, E in 5, I in 2 (invalid).

Hmm, many words with I in position 2 are invalid. Let’s look for I in positions 1, 3, or 4.

- “INANE” – A is excluded.
- “INANE” is invalid.
- “INSET” – S, T excluded.
- “INURE” – R excluded.
- “UNITE” – U, N, I, T, E. T is excluded.
- “ENQUI” – not a word.
- “ENIE” – too short.
- “ENIZE” – not a word.
- “ENINE” – not a word.
- “ENIME” – not a word.
- “ENINE” – not a word.
- “ENINE” – not a word.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words with pattern _ _ N _ E and containing I not in position 2.

Possible words:
- “CHINE” – but I is in 3 (N is there), so invalid.
- “DINER” – R excluded.
- “FINER” – R excluded.
- “HINER” – R excluded.
- “LINER” – R excluded.
- “MINER” – R excluded.
- “PINER” – R excluded.
- “WINER” – R excluded.
- “VINER” – R excluded.
- “MINCE” – I in 2 is invalid.
- “WINE” – too short.
- “CHINE” – I in 3 is invalid (N is there).
- “CHINE” – invalid.

This seems tricky. Let’s try a different approach. Since I must appear somewhere and not in position 2, and we have N in 3 and E in 5, possible positions for I are 1, 3, or 4. But 3 is N, so 1 or 4.

Possible words:
- “IN_ _E” – I in 1.
- “_ _ N I E” – I in 4.

Let’s try I in 4: _ _ N I E.

Valid words:
- “CHINE” – C, H, I, N, E. But I is in 4, N in 3, E in 5. This fits! But is “CHINE” a valid English word? It’s a variant spelling of “chine” (a ridge or crest), but may not be common.

Another:
- “DINIE” – D, I, N, I, E. Double I, but valid? Not sure.
- “FINIE” – F, I, N, I, E. Double I.
- “HINIE” – H, I, N, I, E. Double I.
- “MINIE” – M, I, N, I, E. Double I.

These are possible but have double letters. Let’s try I in 1: I N _ _ E.

But N is in 3, so I N _ _ E with N in 3 would be I N _ N E – but that would be 4 letters for N.

Wait, pattern is I _ N _ E.

Valid words:
- “INANE” – A excluded.
- “INSET” – S, T excluded.
- “INURE” – R excluded.
- “INUSE” – S, U, E – S excluded.
- “INUSE” – invalid.
- “INLET” – T excluded.
- “INGLE” – G, L – but E is in 5, so not matching.

This is harder than expected. Let’s list all valid 5-letter words ending in NE with I somewhere not in 2.

Actually, the pattern is _ _ N _ E with I in 1 or 4.

Let’s try I in 1: I _ N _ E.

Valid words:
- “INLET” – T excluded.
- “INGLE” – G, L – but ends in LE, not NE.
- “INANE” – A excluded.
- “INUSE” – S excluded.
- “INSET” – S, T excluded.
- “INURE” – R excluded.

- “KHINE” – not common.
- “MHINE” – not common.
- “PHINE” – not common.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters in different positions. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters, and no repeats. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, O, S are **not** in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position (✓).

So the secret word ends with E and does **not** contain A, R, O, S.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.
3. Uses other common letters (T, L, N, I, C, etc.) to maximize information.

A good candidate is “TINYE”:
- Ends with E.
- Uses T, I, N, Y – none of which are excluded.
- Common letters and good positional coverage.

Let’s try it.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: tinye -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(-) N(✓) Y(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on “tinye”:

- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 2.
- N(✓) – N is in the word and in position 3.
- Y(x) – Y is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ N _ E
- Letters definitely excluded: A, R, O, S, T, Y
- Letters that must appear somewhere: I (but not in position 2)

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has N in position 3.
2. Has E in position 5.
3. Contains I somewhere except position 2.
4. Uses only letters not in the excluded set.

Possible candidates:
- “CHINE” – but H is uncommon and C is okay, but let’s see if we can use more common letters.
- “MINCE” – M, I, N, C, E. This fits: N in 3, E in 5, I in 2 (but feedback says I is not in 2, so this is invalid).
- “PINNE” – double N, but P is okay, but double letters are less likely.
- “LINNE” – L is okay, but again double N.
- “DINER” – R is excluded.
- “VINER” – R is excluded.
- “HINER” – R is excluded.
- “MINER” – R is excluded.
- “WINCE” – W, I, N, C, E. N is in 3, E in 5, I in 2 (invalid position).
- “WINE” is 4 letters.
- “WINE” plus a letter – but we need 5.
- “CHINE” – C, H, I, N, E. N in 3, E in 5, I in 3 is invalid (N is there).
- “CINER” – R is excluded.
- “HINSE” – H, I, N, S, E. S is excluded.
- “MINHE” – H is okay, but I in 2 is invalid.
- “PINCE” – P, I, N, C, E. N in 3, E in 5, I in 2 (invalid).

Hmm, many words with I in position 2 are invalid. Let’s look for I in positions 1, 3, or 4.

- “INANE” – A is excluded.
- “INANE” is invalid.
- “INSET” – S, T excluded.
- “INURE” – R excluded.
- “UNITE” – U, N, I, T, E. T is excluded.
- “ENQUI” – not a word.
- “ENIE” – too short.
- “ENIZE” – not a word.
- “ENINE” – not a word.
- “ENIME” – not a word.
- “ENINE” – not a word.
- “ENINE” – not a word.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words with pattern _ _ N _ E and containing I not in position 2.

Possible words:
- “CHINE” – but I is in 3 (N is there), so invalid.
- “DINER” – R excluded.
- “FINER” – R excluded.
- “HINER” – R excluded.
- “LINER” – R excluded.
- “MINER” – R excluded.
- “PINER” – R excluded.
- “WINER” – R excluded.
- “VINER” – R excluded.
- “MINCE” – I in 2 is invalid.
- “WINE” – too short.
- “CHINE” – I in 3 is invalid (N is there).
- “CHINE” – invalid.

This seems tricky. Let’s try a different approach. Since I must appear somewhere and not in position 2, and we have N in 3 and E in 5, possible positions for I are 1, 3, or 4. But 3 is N, so 1 or 4.

Possible words:
- “IN_ _E” – I in 1.
- “_ _ N I E” – I in 4.

Let’s try I in 4: _ _ N I E.

Valid words:
- “CHINE” – C, H, I, N, E. But I is in 4, N in 3, E in 5. This fits! But is “CHINE” a valid English word? It’s a variant spelling of “chine” (a ridge or crest), but may not be common.

Another:
- “DINIE” – D, I, N, I, E. Double I, but valid? Not sure.
- “FINIE” – F, I, N, I, E. Double I.
- “HINIE” – H, I, N, I, E. Double I.
- “MINIE” – M, I, N, I, E. Double I.

These are possible but have double letters. Let’s try I in 1: I N _ _ E.

But N is in 3, so I N _ _ E with N in 3 would be I N _ N E – but that would be 4 letters for N.

Wait, pattern is I _ N _ E.

Valid words:
- “INANE” – A excluded.
- “INSET” – S, T excluded.
- “INURE” – R excluded.
- “INUSE” – S, U, E – S excluded.
- “INUSE” – invalid.
- “INLET” – T excluded.
- “INGLE” – G, L – but E is in 5, so not matching.

This is harder than expected. Let’s list all valid 5-letter words ending in NE with I somewhere not in 2.

Actually, the pattern is _ _ N _ E with I in 1 or 4.

Let’s try I in 1: I _ N _ E.

Valid words:
- “INLET” – T excluded.
- “INGLE” – G, L – but ends in LE, not NE.
- “INANE” – A excluded.
- “INUSE” – S excluded.
- “INSET” – S, T excluded.
- “INURE” – R excluded.

I in 4: _ _ N I E.

Valid words:
- “CHINE” – C, H, I, N, E. This is valid (variant spelling).
- “DHINE” – D, H, I, N, E. Not common.
- “FHINE” – not a word.
- “GHINE” – not common.
- “KHINE” – not common.
- “MHINE” – not common.
- “PHINE” – not common.
- “WHINE” – W, H, I, N, E. This is a valid English word!

“WHINE” fits:
- W H I N E
- N in 3 (✓)
- E in 5 (✓)
- I in 4 (not in 2, so valid)
- Uses only letters not in excluded set (A, R, O, S, T, Y).

Let’s try “WHINE”.

Let's update what we know after the three guesses.

1. From arose:  
   A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.  
   E is in position 5 (✓).

2. From tinye:  
   T, Y are not in the word.  
   I is in the word but not in position 2 (-).  
   N is in position 3 (✓).

3. From whine:  
   W, H are not in the word.  
   I is in the word but not in position 3 (-).  
   N is in the word but not in position 3 (-).  
   E is still in position 5 (✓).

Combining these:

- Position 5: E (locked)
- Position 3: N is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from whine feedback). This is a contradiction with tinye feedback which said N is in position 3. Wait, let me re-read carefully.

From tinye: N(✓) means N is in position 3.  
From whine: N(-) means N is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
So N must be in position 3 (confirmed by tinye), and the feedback for whine's N(-) is consistent because N is in position 3, not 4.

So the pattern is: _ _ N _ E

Letters definitely excluded: A, R, O, S, T, Y, W, H.

Letters that must appear: I (but I is not in position 2 or 3).  
So I must be in position 1 or 4.

Possible positions:
- I in 1: I _ N _ E
- I in 4: _ _ N I E

Let's list valid 5-letter English words for both cases.

Case 1: I _ N _ E
Need a letter between I and N, and another between N and E.  
Possible letters left (excluding A,R,O,S,T,Y,W,H): B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Valid words:
- INBNE – not a word.
- INCNE – not a word.
- INDNE – not a word.
- INFNE – not a word.
- INGNE – not a word.
- INJNE – not a word.
- INKNE – not a word.
- INLNE – not a word.
- INMNE – not a word.
- INPNE – not a word.
- INQNE – not a word.
- INUNE – not a word.
- INVNE – not a word.
- INXNE – not a word.
- INZNE – not a word.

No valid words here.

Case 2: _ _ N I E
Need two letters before N, I, E.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Valid English words:
- BUNIE – not common.
- DUNIE – not a word.
- FUNIE – not a word.
- GUNIE – not a word.
- KUNIE – not a word.
- LUNIE – not a word.
- MUNIE – not a word.
- PUNIE – not a word.
- QUINE – Q, U, I, N, E. This is a valid word (variant of ""quint"").
- VINIE – not a word.
- ZUNIE – not a word.

""QUINE"" fits:
- Q U I N E
- N in position 4 (but we know N must be in position 3). Wait, no – in this pattern _ _ N I E, N is in position 3.

Yes:
- Q U N I E – but this would be Q U N I E, which is ""quine"" (valid).
- C H N I E – but H is excluded.
- B U N I E – not a word.
- D U N I E – not a word.
- F U N I E – not a word.
- G U N I E – not a word.
- J U N I E – not a word.
- K U N I E – not a word.
- L U N I E – not a word.
- M U N I E – not a word.
- P U N I E – not a word.
- V U N I E – not a word.
- X U N I E – not a word.
- Z U N I E – not a word.

The only valid word seems to be ""QUINE"".

Let's verify:
- Q U I N E
- N is in position 3 (✓ from tinye)
- E is in position 5 (✓ from arose)
- I is in position 2 – but feedback from tinye said I is not in position 2 (-). This is a conflict.

Wait, in ""QUINE"", I is in position 2, but tinye feedback said I is not in position 2. So ""QUINE"" is invalid.

This suggests I need to look for other words.

Let me try:
- B U N I E – not a word.
- C H N I E – H excluded.
- D U N I E – not a word.
- F U N I E – not a word.
- G U N I E – not a word.
- L U N I E – not a word.
- M U N I E – not a word.
- P U N I E – not a word.
- V U N I E – not a word.
- Z U N I E – not a word.

Actually, let's think differently – maybe I is in position 4.

Pattern: _ _ N I E

Valid English words:
- B U N I E – not a word.
- C H N I E – H excluded.
- D U N I E – not a word.
- F U N I E – not a word.
- G U N I E – not a word.
- L U N I E – not a word.
- M U N I E – not a word.
- P U N I E – not a word.
- V U N I E – not a word.
- Z U N I E – not a word.

It seems no standard words fit. Let me check if I missed any.

Actually, ""CHINE"" was considered earlier but is obscure. Let me try:

- C H I N E – but I is in position 3, which conflicts with I not in 3 (from whine feedback).

Wait, the only remaining possibility is that I is in position 1: I _ N _ E.

But earlier I couldn't find valid words. Let me re-examine.

Valid English words starting with I, having N in position 3, ending in E:
- INLET – T excluded.
- INURE – R excluded.
- INANE – A excluded.
- INUSE – S excluded.
- INSET – S, T excluded.
- INLET – T excluded.

No valid words remain. This suggests I may have made an error in earlier steps.

Re-examining feedback:
- arose: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓) → E is last.
- tinye: T(x) I(-) N(✓) Y(x) E(✓) → N is in position 3.
- whine: W(x) H(x) I(-) N(-) E(✓) → N is in word but not in position 4 (consistent with N in 3), I is in word but not in position 3.

Thus, pattern is _ _ N _ E with I somewhere not in 2 or 3 → I must be in 1 or 4.

But no standard words fit. This implies the word must be ""CHINE"" or similar, but let's try:

""CHINE"" – C H I N E:
- C, H, I, N, E
- N in 3 (✓)
- E in 5 (✓)
- I in 4 (not in 2 or 3, so valid)
- Letters used: C, H, I, N, E – none excluded except H was not tested yet, but H is allowed (only A,R,O,S,T,Y,W were excluded).

""CHINE"" is a valid variant spelling, so let's try it.

<guess>chine</guess>",chine,"Let's update what we know after the three guesses.

1. From arose:  
   A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.  
   E is in position 5 (✓).

2. From tinye:  
   T, Y are not in the word.  
   I is in the word but not in position 2 (-).  
   N is in position 3 (✓).

3. From whine:

   I is in the word but not in position 3 (-).  
   N is in the word but not in position 3 (-).  
   E is still in position 5 (✓).

Combining these:

- Position 5: E (locked)
- Position 3: N is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from whine feedback). This is a contradiction with tinye feedback which said N is in position 3. Wait, let me re-read carefully.

From tinye: N(✓) means N is in position 3.  
From whine: N(-) means N is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
So N must be in position 3 (confirmed by tinye), and the feedback for whine's N(-) is consistent because N is in position 3, not 4.

So the pattern is: _ _ N _ E

Letters definitely excluded: A, R, O, S, T, Y, W, H.

Letters that must appear: I (but I is not in position 2 or 3).  
So I must be in position 1 or 4.

Possible positions:

- I in 4: _ _ N I E

Let's list valid 5-letter English words for both cases.

Case 1: I _ N _ E
Need a letter between I and N, and another between N and E.  
Possible letters left (excluding A,R,O,S,T,Y,W,H): B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Valid words:
- INBNE – not a word.
- INCNE – not a word.

No valid words here.

Case 2: _ _ N I E
Need two letters before N, I, E.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Valid English words:
- BUNIE – not common.
- DUNIE – not a word.
- FUNIE – not a word.
- GUNIE – not a word.
- KUNIE – not a word.
- LUNIE – not a word.
- MUNIE – not a word.
- PUNIE – not a word.
- QUINE – Q, U, I, N, E. This is a valid word (variant of ""quint"").
- VINIE – not a word.
- ZUNIE – not a word.

""QUINE"" fits:
- Q U I N E
- N in position 4 (but we know N must be in position 3). Wait, no – in this pattern _ _ N I E, N is in position 3.

Yes:
- Q U N I E – but this would be Q U N I E, which is ""quine"" (valid).
- C H N I E – but H is excluded.
- B U N I E – not a word.
- D U N I E – not a word.
- F U N I E – not a word.
- G U N I E – not a word.
- J U N I E – not a word.
- K U N I E – not a word.
- L U N I E – not a word.
- M U N I E – not a word.
- P U N I E – not a word.
- V U N I E – not a word.
- X U N I E – not a word.
- Z U N I E – not a word.

The only valid word seems to be ""QUINE"".

Let's verify:
- Q U I N E
- N is in position 3 (✓ from tinye)
- E is in position 5 (✓ from arose)
- I is in position 2 – but feedback from tinye said I is not in position 2 (-). This is a conflict.

Wait, in ""QUINE"", I is in position 2, but tinye feedback said I is not in position 2. So ""QUINE"" is invalid.

This suggests I need to look for other words.

Let me try:
- B U N I E – not a word.
- C H N I E – H excluded.
- D U N I E – not a word.
- F U N I E – not a word.
- G U N I E – not a word.
- L U N I E – not a word.
- M U N I E – not a word.
- P U N I E – not a word.
- V U N I E – not a word.
- Z U N I E – not a word.

Actually, let's think differently – maybe I is in position 4.

Pattern: _ _ N I E

Valid English words:
- B U N I E – not a word.
- C H N I E – H excluded.
- D U N I E – not a word.
- F U N I E – not a word.
- G U N I E – not a word.
- L U N I E – not a word.
- M U N I E – not a word.
- P U N I E – not a word.
- V U N I E – not a word.
- Z U N I E – not a word.

It seems no standard words fit. Let me check if I missed any.

Actually, ""CHINE"" was considered earlier but is obscure. Let me try:

- C H I N E – but I is in position 3, which conflicts with I not in 3 (from whine feedback).

Wait, the only remaining possibility is that I is in position 1: I _ N _ E.

But earlier I couldn't find valid words. Let me re-examine.

Valid English words starting with I, having N in position 3, ending in E:
- INLET – T excluded.
- INURE – R excluded.
- INANE – A excluded.
- INUSE – S excluded.
- INSET – S, T excluded.
- INLET – T excluded.

No valid words remain. This suggests I may have made an error in earlier steps.

Re-examining feedback:
- arose: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓) → E is last.
- tinye: T(x) I(-) N(✓) Y(x) E(✓) → N is in position 3.
- whine: W(x) H(x) I(-) N(-) E(✓) → N is in word but not in position 4 (consistent with N in 3), I is in word but not in position 3.

Thus, pattern is _ _ N _ E with I somewhere not in 2 or 3 → I must be in 1 or 4.

But no standard words fit. This implies the word must be ""CHINE"" or similar, but let's try:

""CHINE"" – C H I N E:
- C, H, I, N, E
- N in 3 (✓)
- E in 5 (✓)
- I in 4 (not in 2 or 3, so valid)
- Letters used: C, H, I, N, E – none excluded except H was not tested yet, but H is allowed (only A,R,O,S,T,Y,W were excluded).

""CHINE"" is a valid variant spelling, so let's try it.",Guess 4: chine -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(-) N(-) E(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters in different positions. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters, and no repeats. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, O, S are **not** in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position (✓).

So the secret word ends with E and does **not** contain A, R, O, S.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.
3. Uses other common letters (T, L, N, I, C, etc.) to maximize information.

A good candidate is “TINYE”:
- Ends with E.
- Uses T, I, N, Y – none of which are excluded.
- Common letters and good positional coverage.

Let’s try it.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: tinye -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(-) N(✓) Y(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on “tinye”:

- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 2.
- N(✓) – N is in the word and in position 3.
- Y(x) – Y is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ N _ E
- Letters definitely excluded: A, R, O, S, T, Y
- Letters that must appear somewhere: I (but not in position 2)

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has N in position 3.
2. Has E in position 5.
3. Contains I somewhere except position 2.
4. Uses only letters not in the excluded set.

Possible candidates:
- “CHINE” – but H is uncommon and C is okay, but let’s see if we can use more common letters.
- “MINCE” – M, I, N, C, E. This fits: N in 3, E in 5, I in 2 (but feedback says I is not in 2, so this is invalid).
- “PINNE” – double N, but P is okay, but double letters are less likely.
- “LINNE” – L is okay, but again double N.
- “DINER” – R is excluded.
- “VINER” – R is excluded.
- “HINER” – R is excluded.
- “MINER” – R is excluded.
- “WINCE” – W, I, N, C, E. N is in 3, E in 5, I in 2 (invalid position).
- “WINE” is 4 letters.
- “WINE” plus a letter – but we need 5.
- “CHINE” – C, H, I, N, E. N in 3, E in 5, I in 3 is invalid (N is there).
- “CINER” – R is excluded.
- “HINSE” – H, I, N, S, E. S is excluded.
- “MINHE” – H is okay, but I in 2 is invalid.
- “PINCE” – P, I, N, C, E. N in 3, E in 5, I in 2 (invalid).

Hmm, many words with I in position 2 are invalid. Let’s look for I in positions 1, 3, or 4.

- “INANE” – A is excluded.
- “INANE” is invalid.
- “INSET” – S, T excluded.
- “INURE” – R excluded.
- “UNITE” – U, N, I, T, E. T is excluded.
- “ENQUI” – not a word.
- “ENIE” – too short.
- “ENIZE” – not a word.
- “ENINE” – not a word.
- “ENIME” – not a word.
- “ENINE” – not a word.
- “ENINE” – not a word.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words with pattern _ _ N _ E and containing I not in position 2.

Possible words:
- “CHINE” – but I is in 3 (N is there), so invalid.
- “DINER” – R excluded.
- “FINER” – R excluded.
- “HINER” – R excluded.
- “LINER” – R excluded.
- “MINER” – R excluded.
- “PINER” – R excluded.
- “WINER” – R excluded.
- “VINER” – R excluded.
- “MINCE” – I in 2 is invalid.
- “WINE” – too short.
- “CHINE” – I in 3 is invalid (N is there).
- “CHINE” – invalid.

This seems tricky. Let’s try a different approach. Since I must appear somewhere and not in position 2, and we have N in 3 and E in 5, possible positions for I are 1, 3, or 4. But 3 is N, so 1 or 4.

Possible words:
- “IN_ _E” – I in 1.
- “_ _ N I E” – I in 4.

Let’s try I in 4: _ _ N I E.

Valid words:
- “CHINE” – C, H, I, N, E. But I is in 4, N in 3, E in 5. This fits! But is “CHINE” a valid English word? It’s a variant spelling of “chine” (a ridge or crest), but may not be common.

Another:
- “DINIE” – D, I, N, I, E. Double I, but valid? Not sure.
- “FINIE” – F, I, N, I, E. Double I.
- “HINIE” – H, I, N, I, E. Double I.
- “MINIE” – M, I, N, I, E. Double I.

These are possible but have double letters. Let’s try I in 1: I N _ _ E.

But N is in 3, so I N _ _ E with N in 3 would be I N _ N E – but that would be 4 letters for N.

Wait, pattern is I _ N _ E.

Valid words:
- “INANE” – A excluded.
- “INSET” – S, T excluded.
- “INURE” – R excluded.
- “INUSE” – S, U, E – S excluded.
- “INUSE” – invalid.
- “INLET” – T excluded.
- “INGLE” – G, L – but E is in 5, so not matching.

This is harder than expected. Let’s list all valid 5-letter words ending in NE with I somewhere not in 2.

Actually, the pattern is _ _ N _ E with I in 1 or 4.

Let’s try I in 1: I _ N _ E.

Valid words:
- “INLET” – T excluded.
- “INGLE” – G, L – but ends in LE, not NE.
- “INANE” – A excluded.
- “INUSE” – S excluded.
- “INSET” – S, T excluded.
- “INURE” – R excluded.

I in 4: _ _ N I E.

Valid words:
- “CHINE” – C, H, I, N, E. This is valid (variant spelling).
- “DHINE” – D, H, I, N, E. Not common.
- “FHINE” – not a word.
- “GHINE” – not common.
- “KHINE” – not common.
- “MHINE” – not common.
- “PHINE” – not common.
- “WHINE” – W, H, I, N, E. This is a valid English word!

“WHINE” fits:
- W H I N E
- N in 3 (✓)
- E in 5 (✓)
- I in 4 (not in 2, so valid)
- Uses only letters not in excluded set (A, R, O, S, T, Y).

Let’s try “WHINE”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: tinye -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(-) N(✓) Y(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: whine -> FEEDBACK: W(x) H(x) I(-) N(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's update what we know after the three guesses.

1. From arose:  
   A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.  
   E is in position 5 (✓).

2. From tinye:  
   T, Y are not in the word.  
   I is in the word but not in position 2 (-).  
   N is in position 3 (✓).

3. From whine:  
   W, H are not in the word.  
   I is in the word but not in position 3 (-).  
   N is in the word but not in position 3 (-).  
   E is still in position 5 (✓).

Combining these:

- Position 5: E (locked)
- Position 3: N is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from whine feedback). This is a contradiction with tinye feedback which said N is in position 3. Wait, let me re-read carefully.

From tinye: N(✓) means N is in position 3.  
From whine: N(-) means N is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
So N must be in position 3 (confirmed by tinye), and the feedback for whine's N(-) is consistent because N is in position 3, not 4.

So the pattern is: _ _ N _ E

Letters definitely excluded: A, R, O, S, T, Y, W, H.

Letters that must appear: I (but I is not in position 2 or 3).  
So I must be in position 1 or 4.

Possible positions:
- I in 1: I _ N _ E
- I in 4: _ _ N I E

Let's list valid 5-letter English words for both cases.

Case 1: I _ N _ E
Need a letter between I and N, and another between N and E.  
Possible letters left (excluding A,R,O,S,T,Y,W,H): B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Valid words:
- INBNE – not a word.
- INCNE – not a word.
- INDNE – not a word.
- INFNE – not a word.
- INGNE – not a word.
- INJNE – not a word.
- INKNE – not a word.
- INLNE – not a word.
- INMNE – not a word.
- INPNE – not a word.
- INQNE – not a word.
- INUNE – not a word.
- INVNE – not a word.
- INXNE – not a word.
- INZNE – not a word.

No valid words here.

Case 2: _ _ N I E
Need two letters before N, I, E.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Valid English words:
- BUNIE – not common.
- DUNIE – not a word.
- FUNIE – not a word.
- GUNIE – not a word.
- KUNIE – not a word.
- LUNIE – not a word.
- MUNIE – not a word.
- PUNIE – not a word.
- QUINE – Q, U, I, N, E. This is a valid word (variant of ""quint"").
- VINIE – not a word.
- ZUNIE – not a word.

""QUINE"" fits:
- Q U I N E
- N in position 4 (but we know N must be in position 3). Wait, no – in this pattern _ _ N I E, N is in position 3.

Yes:
- Q U N I E – but this would be Q U N I E, which is ""quine"" (valid).
- C H N I E – but H is excluded.
- B U N I E – not a word.
- D U N I E – not a word.
- F U N I E – not a word.
- G U N I E – not a word.
- J U N I E – not a word.
- K U N I E – not a word.
- L U N I E – not a word.
- M U N I E – not a word.
- P U N I E – not a word.
- V U N I E – not a word.
- X U N I E – not a word.
- Z U N I E – not a word.

The only valid word seems to be ""QUINE"".

Let's verify:
- Q U I N E
- N is in position 3 (✓ from tinye)
- E is in position 5 (✓ from arose)
- I is in position 2 – but feedback from tinye said I is not in position 2 (-). This is a conflict.

Wait, in ""QUINE"", I is in position 2, but tinye feedback said I is not in position 2. So ""QUINE"" is invalid.

This suggests I need to look for other words.

Let me try:
- B U N I E – not a word.
- C H N I E – H excluded.
- D U N I E – not a word.
- F U N I E – not a word.
- G U N I E – not a word.
- L U N I E – not a word.
- M U N I E – not a word.
- P U N I E – not a word.
- V U N I E – not a word.
- Z U N I E – not a word.

Actually, let's think differently – maybe I is in position 4.

Pattern: _ _ N I E

Valid English words:
- B U N I E – not a word.
- C H N I E – H excluded.
- D U N I E – not a word.
- F U N I E – not a word.
- G U N I E – not a word.
- L U N I E – not a word.
- M U N I E – not a word.
- P U N I E – not a word.
- V U N I E – not a word.
- Z U N I E – not a word.

It seems no standard words fit. Let me check if I missed any.

Actually, ""CHINE"" was considered earlier but is obscure. Let me try:

- C H I N E – but I is in position 3, which conflicts with I not in 3 (from whine feedback).

Wait, the only remaining possibility is that I is in position 1: I _ N _ E.

But earlier I couldn't find valid words. Let me re-examine.

Valid English words starting with I, having N in position 3, ending in E:
- INLET – T excluded.
- INURE – R excluded.
- INANE – A excluded.
- INUSE – S excluded.
- INSET – S, T excluded.
- INLET – T excluded.

No valid words remain. This suggests I may have made an error in earlier steps.

Re-examining feedback:
- arose: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓) → E is last.
- tinye: T(x) I(-) N(✓) Y(x) E(✓) → N is in position 3.
- whine: W(x) H(x) I(-) N(-) E(✓) → N is in word but not in position 4 (consistent with N in 3), I is in word but not in position 3.

Thus, pattern is _ _ N _ E with I somewhere not in 2 or 3 → I must be in 1 or 4.

But no standard words fit. This implies the word must be ""CHINE"" or similar, but let's try:

""CHINE"" – C H I N E:
- C, H, I, N, E
- N in 3 (✓)
- E in 5 (✓)
- I in 4 (not in 2 or 3, so valid)
- Letters used: C, H, I, N, E – none excluded except H was not tested yet, but H is allowed (only A,R,O,S,T,Y,W were excluded).

""CHINE"" is a valid variant spelling, so let's try it.

Let's consolidate all the information we have so far.

1. Position 5 is definitely E (✓ from every guess).
2. N is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from Guess 3: N(-)).
   However, Guess 2 said N(✓) meaning it IS in position 3.  
   This is a contradiction unless the feedback was mis-read.

Re-examining carefully:

- Guess 2 (tinye): T(x) I(-) N(✓) Y(x) E(✓)
  – N(✓) means N is in position 3.
- Guess 3 (whine): W(x) H(x) I(-) N(-) E(✓)
  – N(-) means N is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So N must be in position 3 (from tinye) and also must NOT be in position 4 (from whine), which is redundant.  
Therefore, the pattern is _ _ N _ E with N fixed at position 3.

3. Letters definitely NOT in the word (from all guesses):
   A, R, O, S, T, Y, W, H, C.

4. I is in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from tinye and whine feedback).
   Since position 3 is N, I must be in position 1 or 4.

5. Remaining possible letters (not yet excluded):
   B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters in different positions. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters, and no repeats. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, O, S are **not** in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct (last) position (✓).

So the secret word ends with E and does **not** contain A, R, O, S.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.
3. Uses other common letters (T, L, N, I, C, etc.) to maximize information.

A good candidate is “TINYE”:
- Ends with E.
- Uses T, I, N, Y – none of which are excluded.
- Common letters and good positional coverage.

Let’s try it.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: tinye -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(-) N(✓) Y(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on “tinye”:

- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 2.
- N(✓) – N is in the word and in position 3.
- Y(x) – Y is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ N _ E
- Letters definitely excluded: A, R, O, S, T, Y
- Letters that must appear somewhere: I (but not in position 2)

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has N in position 3.
2. Has E in position 5.
3. Contains I somewhere except position 2.
4. Uses only letters not in the excluded set.

Possible candidates:
- “CHINE” – but H is uncommon and C is okay, but let’s see if we can use more common letters.
- “MINCE” – M, I, N, C, E. This fits: N in 3, E in 5, I in 2 (but feedback says I is not in 2, so this is invalid).
- “PINNE” – double N, but P is okay, but double letters are less likely.
- “LINNE” – L is okay, but again double N.
- “DINER” – R is excluded.
- “VINER” – R is excluded.
- “HINER” – R is excluded.
- “MINER” – R is excluded.
- “WINCE” – W, I, N, C, E. N is in 3, E in 5, I in 2 (invalid position).
- “WINE” is 4 letters.
- “WINE” plus a letter – but we need 5.
- “CHINE” – C, H, I, N, E. N in 3, E in 5, I in 3 is invalid (N is there).
- “CINER” – R is excluded.
- “HINSE” – H, I, N, S, E. S is excluded.
- “MINHE” – H is okay, but I in 2 is invalid.
- “PINCE” – P, I, N, C, E. N in 3, E in 5, I in 2 (invalid).

Hmm, many words with I in position 2 are invalid. Let’s look for I in positions 1, 3, or 4.

- “INANE” – A is excluded.
- “INANE” is invalid.
- “INSET” – S, T excluded.
- “INURE” – R excluded.
- “UNITE” – U, N, I, T, E. T is excluded.
- “ENQUI” – not a word.
- “ENIE” – too short.
- “ENIZE” – not a word.
- “ENINE” – not a word.
- “ENIME” – not a word.
- “ENINE” – not a word.
- “ENINE” – not a word.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words with pattern _ _ N _ E and containing I not in position 2.

Possible words:
- “CHINE” – but I is in 3 (N is there), so invalid.
- “DINER” – R excluded.
- “FINER” – R excluded.
- “HINER” – R excluded.
- “LINER” – R excluded.
- “MINER” – R excluded.
- “PINER” – R excluded.
- “WINER” – R excluded.
- “VINER” – R excluded.
- “MINCE” – I in 2 is invalid.
- “WINE” – too short.
- “CHINE” – I in 3 is invalid (N is there).
- “CHINE” – invalid.

This seems tricky. Let’s try a different approach. Since I must appear somewhere and not in position 2, and we have N in 3 and E in 5, possible positions for I are 1, 3, or 4. But 3 is N, so 1 or 4.

Possible words:
- “IN_ _E” – I in 1.
- “_ _ N I E” – I in 4.

Let’s try I in 4: _ _ N I E.

Valid words:
- “CHINE” – C, H, I, N, E. But I is in 4, N in 3, E in 5. This fits! But is “CHINE” a valid English word? It’s a variant spelling of “chine” (a ridge or crest), but may not be common.

Another:
- “DINIE” – D, I, N, I, E. Double I, but valid? Not sure.
- “FINIE” – F, I, N, I, E. Double I.
- “HINIE” – H, I, N, I, E. Double I.
- “MINIE” – M, I, N, I, E. Double I.

These are possible but have double letters. Let’s try I in 1: I N _ _ E.

But N is in 3, so I N _ _ E with N in 3 would be I N _ N E – but that would be 4 letters for N.

Wait, pattern is I _ N _ E.

Valid words:
- “INANE” – A excluded.
- “INSET” – S, T excluded.
- “INURE” – R excluded.
- “INUSE” – S, U, E – S excluded.
- “INUSE” – invalid.
- “INLET” – T excluded.
- “INGLE” – G, L – but E is in 5, so not matching.

This is harder than expected. Let’s list all valid 5-letter words ending in NE with I somewhere not in 2.

Actually, the pattern is _ _ N _ E with I in 1 or 4.

Let’s try I in 1: I _ N _ E.

Valid words:
- “INLET” – T excluded.
- “INGLE” – G, L – but ends in LE, not NE.
- “INANE” – A excluded.
- “INUSE” – S excluded.
- “INSET” – S, T excluded.
- “INURE” – R excluded.

I in 4: _ _ N I E.

Valid words:
- “CHINE” – C, H, I, N, E. This is valid (variant spelling).
- “DHINE” – D, H, I, N, E. Not common.
- “FHINE” – not a word.
- “GHINE” – not common.
- “KHINE” – not common.
- “MHINE” – not common.
- “PHINE” – not common.
- “WHINE” – W, H, I, N, E. This is a valid English word!

“WHINE” fits:
- W H I N E
- N in 3 (✓)
- E in 5 (✓)
- I in 4 (not in 2, so valid)
- Uses only letters not in excluded set (A, R, O, S, T, Y).

Let’s try “WHINE”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: tinye -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(-) N(✓) Y(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: whine -> FEEDBACK: W(x) H(x) I(-) N(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's update what we know after the three guesses.

1. From arose:  
   A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.  
   E is in position 5 (✓).

2. From tinye:  
   T, Y are not in the word.  
   I is in the word but not in position 2 (-).  
   N is in position 3 (✓).

3. From whine:  
   W, H are not in the word.  
   I is in the word but not in position 3 (-).  
   N is in the word but not in position 3 (-).  
   E is still in position 5 (✓).

Combining these:

- Position 5: E (locked)
- Position 3: N is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from whine feedback). This is a contradiction with tinye feedback which said N is in position 3. Wait, let me re-read carefully.

From tinye: N(✓) means N is in position 3.  
From whine: N(-) means N is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
So N must be in position 3 (confirmed by tinye), and the feedback for whine's N(-) is consistent because N is in position 3, not 4.

So the pattern is: _ _ N _ E

Letters definitely excluded: A, R, O, S, T, Y, W, H.

Letters that must appear: I (but I is not in position 2 or 3).  
So I must be in position 1 or 4.

Possible positions:
- I in 1: I _ N _ E
- I in 4: _ _ N I E

Let's list valid 5-letter English words for both cases.

Case 1: I _ N _ E
Need a letter between I and N, and another between N and E.  
Possible letters left (excluding A,R,O,S,T,Y,W,H): B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Valid words:
- INBNE – not a word.
- INCNE – not a word.
- INDNE – not a word.
- INFNE – not a word.
- INGNE – not a word.
- INJNE – not a word.
- INKNE – not a word.
- INLNE – not a word.
- INMNE – not a word.
- INPNE – not a word.
- INQNE – not a word.
- INUNE – not a word.
- INVNE – not a word.
- INXNE – not a word.
- INZNE – not a word.

No valid words here.

Case 2: _ _ N I E
Need two letters before N, I, E.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Valid English words:
- BUNIE – not common.
- DUNIE – not a word.
- FUNIE – not a word.
- GUNIE – not a word.
- KUNIE – not a word.
- LUNIE – not a word.
- MUNIE – not a word.
- PUNIE – not a word.
- QUINE – Q, U, I, N, E. This is a valid word (variant of ""quint"").
- VINIE – not a word.
- ZUNIE – not a word.

""QUINE"" fits:
- Q U I N E
- N in position 4 (but we know N must be in position 3). Wait, no – in this pattern _ _ N I E, N is in position 3.

Yes:
- Q U N I E – but this would be Q U N I E, which is ""quine"" (valid).
- C H N I E – but H is excluded.
- B U N I E – not a word.
- D U N I E – not a word.
- F U N I E – not a word.
- G U N I E – not a word.
- J U N I E – not a word.
- K U N I E – not a word.
- L U N I E – not a word.
- M U N I E – not a word.
- P U N I E – not a word.
- V U N I E – not a word.
- X U N I E – not a word.
- Z U N I E – not a word.

The only valid word seems to be ""QUINE"".

Let's verify:
- Q U I N E
- N is in position 3 (✓ from tinye)
- E is in position 5 (✓ from arose)
- I is in position 2 – but feedback from tinye said I is not in position 2 (-). This is a conflict.

Wait, in ""QUINE"", I is in position 2, but tinye feedback said I is not in position 2. So ""QUINE"" is invalid.

This suggests I need to look for other words.

Let me try:
- B U N I E – not a word.
- C H N I E – H excluded.
- D U N I E – not a word.
- F U N I E – not a word.
- G U N I E – not a word.
- L U N I E – not a word.
- M U N I E – not a word.
- P U N I E – not a word.
- V U N I E – not a word.
- Z U N I E – not a word.

Actually, let's think differently – maybe I is in position 4.

Pattern: _ _ N I E

Valid English words:
- B U N I E – not a word.
- C H N I E – H excluded.
- D U N I E – not a word.
- F U N I E – not a word.
- G U N I E – not a word.
- L U N I E – not a word.
- M U N I E – not a word.
- P U N I E – not a word.
- V U N I E – not a word.
- Z U N I E – not a word.

It seems no standard words fit. Let me check if I missed any.

Actually, ""CHINE"" was considered earlier but is obscure. Let me try:

- C H I N E – but I is in position 3, which conflicts with I not in 3 (from whine feedback).

Wait, the only remaining possibility is that I is in position 1: I _ N _ E.

But earlier I couldn't find valid words. Let me re-examine.

Valid English words starting with I, having N in position 3, ending in E:
- INLET – T excluded.
- INURE – R excluded.
- INANE – A excluded.
- INUSE – S excluded.
- INSET – S, T excluded.
- INLET – T excluded.

No valid words remain. This suggests I may have made an error in earlier steps.

Re-examining feedback:
- arose: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓) → E is last.
- tinye: T(x) I(-) N(✓) Y(x) E(✓) → N is in position 3.
- whine: W(x) H(x) I(-) N(-) E(✓) → N is in word but not in position 4 (consistent with N in 3), I is in word but not in position 3.

Thus, pattern is _ _ N _ E with I somewhere not in 2 or 3 → I must be in 1 or 4.

But no standard words fit. This implies the word must be ""CHINE"" or similar, but let's try:

""CHINE"" – C H I N E:
- C, H, I, N, E
- N in 3 (✓)
- E in 5 (✓)
- I in 4 (not in 2 or 3, so valid)
- Letters used: C, H, I, N, E – none excluded except H was not tested yet, but H is allowed (only A,R,O,S,T,Y,W were excluded).

""CHINE"" is a valid variant spelling, so let's try it.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: tinye -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(-) N(✓) Y(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: whine -> FEEDBACK: W(x) H(x) I(-) N(-) E(✓)
Guess 4: chine -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(-) N(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's consolidate all the information we have so far.

1. Position 5 is definitely E (✓ from every guess).
2. N is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from Guess 3: N(-)).
   However, Guess 2 said N(✓) meaning it IS in position 3.  
   This is a contradiction unless the feedback was mis-read.

Re-examining carefully:

- Guess 2 (tinye): T(x) I(-) N(✓) Y(x) E(✓)
  – N(✓) means N is in position 3.
- Guess 3 (whine): W(x) H(x) I(-) N(-) E(✓)
  – N(-) means N is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So N must be in position 3 (from tinye) and also must NOT be in position 4 (from whine), which is redundant.  
Therefore, the pattern is _ _ N _ E with N fixed at position 3.

3. Letters definitely NOT in the word (from all guesses):
   A, R, O, S, T, Y, W, H, C.

4. I is in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from tinye and whine feedback).
   Since position 3 is N, I must be in position 1 or 4.

5. Remaining possible letters (not yet excluded):
   B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Z.

Now we look for 5-letter words matching:

- I _ N _ E   (I in 1)
- _ _ N I E   (I in 4)

Checking valid English words:

I _ N _ E:
- INBNE – not a word.
- INDBE – not a word.
- INFNE – not a word.
- INGNE – not a word.
- INJNE – not a word.
- INKNE – not a word.
- INLNE – not a word.
- INMNE – not a word.
- INPNE – not a word.
- INQNE – not a word.
- INUNE – not a word.
- INVNE – not a word.
- INXNE – not a word.
- INZNE – not a word.

No valid words found.

_ _ N I E:
- B U N I E – not a word.
- D U N I E – not a word.
- F U N I E – not a word.
- G U N I E – not a word.
- L U N I E – not a word.
- M U N I E – not a word.
- P U N I E – not a word.
- V U N I E – not a word.
- Z U N I E – not a word.

The only remaining possibility is that I is in position 4 and the first two letters are from the allowed set.

Looking up valid English words ending in NIE:
- BUNIE – not a word.
- DUNIE – not a word.
- FUNIE – not a word.
- GUNIE – not a word.
- LUNIE – not a word.
- MUNIE – not a word.
- PUNIE – not a word.
- QUINE – Q, U, I, N, E.  
  – Pattern: Q U N I E (I in 4, N in 3, E in 5).
  – Letters: Q, U, N, I, E – none are excluded.
  – This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next logical guess is QUINE.

Let's update the accumulated information after five guesses.

1. Position 5 is locked as E (✓ from every guess).
2. N is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from Guess 2: N(✓) in position 3 and Guess 3/4: N(-) meaning N is NOT in positions 3 or 4).  
   This implies N must be in position 1 or 2.
3. I is in the word but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from Guess 2, 3, 5).  
   Since position 5 is E, the only remaining spot for I is position 1.
4. Letters definitely NOT in the word (from all guesses):  
   A, R, O, S, T, Y, W, H, C, Q, U.

So the pattern must be:  
I _ N _ E, with N in position 2 and I in position 1, and the remaining letters chosen only from the still-allowed set {B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, V, X, Z}.

We need a 5-letter word of the form I _ N _ E.  
Scanning the dictionary for such patterns:

- I B N E – too short.
- I D N E – not a word.
- I F N E – not a word.
- I G N E – “igne” is not valid.
- I L N E – not a word.
- I M N E – not a word.
- I P N E – not a word.
- I V N E – not a word.
- I Z N E – not a word.

The only common English word that fits I _ N _ E is “INLET” (I-N-L-E-T), but we have already ruled out T.

Next possibility: “INANE” – A is excluded.  
“INSET” – S, T excluded.  
“INURE” – R, U excluded.  
“INUSE” – S, U excluded.  
“INUSE” is invalid.

It appears the only remaining valid word that fits all constraints is “INLET”, but T is excluded.  
This suggests we must have missed an allowed word.

Rechecking the allowed letters: {B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, V, X, Z}.

Valid English word: “INKEE” – but this is 5 letters, ends in E, has N in position 2, I in 1, but K is allowed.  
However, “INKEE” is not standard.

Another candidate: “INGOT” – but O, T excluded.

Actually, the word “INGIE” is not valid.  
“INGOT” is invalid due to O and T.

Let’s try “INBEE” – invalid.

The only remaining possibility is “INKEE” (variant spelling of “ink” + “ee”), but it’s obscure.

However, the standard word “INLET” is invalid due to T.  
We must conclude the correct word is “INLET”, but T is excluded – this implies an earlier mistake.

Re-examining:  
Guess 3 (whine) feedback: N(-) means N is NOT in position 4, but does NOT preclude N from being in position 3.  
Guess 2 (tinye) feedback: N(✓) means N IS in position 3.

Therefore, N is fixed at position 3, and the earlier interpretation was correct.  
So the pattern is _ _ N _ E with N in position 3.

Re-evaluating I placement:  
From Guess 2 (I(-)) and Guess 3 (I(-)) and Guess 5 (I(-)), I is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
Position 3 is N, so I must be in position 1 or 5.  
Position 5 is E, so I must be in position 1.

Thus the pattern is I _ N _ E.

Allowed letters for positions 2 and 4: {B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, V, X, Z}.

Valid English word: “INKEE” – not standard.  
“INBEE” – not standard.  
“INDLE” – not standard.  
“INGLE” – L is allowed, but “INGLE” is a word (variant of “ingle” – a fire pit).

“INGLE” fits:  
I N G L E  
- I in position 1 (required)  
- N in position 2 (required)  
- G, L from allowed letters  
- E in position 5 (required)  
- No excluded letters.

Therefore, the correct next guess is INGLE.
