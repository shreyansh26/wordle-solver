### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word and narrow down possibilities efficiently.

1. Letters that are NOT in the word:  
   S, L, A, T, C, H, O, G

2. Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown):  
   E, R, I, N

3. Position constraints so far:
   - E cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5.  
   - R cannot be in positions 1 or 4.  
   - I cannot be in position 3.  
   - N cannot be in position 5.

4. Remaining unused common letters:  
   D, F, K, M, P, U, Y, B, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses only the letters E, R, I, N plus any of the still-unused common letters.  
- Respects all the position bans above.

Let’s list possible positions for each confirmed letter:

E: allowed in positions 1 or 3.  
R: allowed in positions 2, 3, or 5.  
I: allowed in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.  
N: allowed in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

A quick scan of common 5-letter words that fit these constraints and use only the allowed letters gives “INFER”:

- Letters: I, N, F, E, R  
- F is still unused and common.  
- Position check:  
  – I in 1 (allowed)  
  – N in 2 (allowed)  
  – F in 3 (unused)  
  – E in 4 → but E is banned from 4. Oops!  
So E cannot be in 4.

Next candidate: “NERVE” – but V is unused and it repeats E.  
“FIRED” – D is unused, but R is in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (banned).  
“PRIME” – P, M, E; but E in 5 (banned).  
“UNDER” – U is unused, but N in 1 (allowed), D in 2, E in 3 (allowed), R in 5 (allowed).  
Check letters: U, N, D, E, R.  
All letters are allowed (U is new, N, D, E, R are confirmed).  
Positions:  
U: no constraint.  
N: 1 (allowed).  
D: no constraint.  
E: 3 (allowed).  
R: 5 (allowed).  

“UNDER” satisfies every rule.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word and narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.
- DOES contain E, but not in the 5th position.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes E (but not as the last letter).
2. Excludes S, L, A, T.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out and E is confirmed).

Let’s try “CHORE”:
- C, H, O, R are new letters.
- E is included and in a new position (4th).
- No S, L, A, T.

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, C, H, O  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: E, R  

So the secret word:
- Contains both E and R.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, C, H, O.
- E is not in position 4 or 5 (because in CHORE it was in position 4 and 5 respectively, and both were marked “-”).
- R is not in position 4 (because in CHORE it was in position 4 and was marked “-”).

Remaining common letters we can still use: N, D, G, B, F, I, U, M, P, Y, K, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E and R.
2. Avoids all the letters already ruled out (S, L, A, T, C, H, O).
3. Places E somewhere other than positions 4 or 5.
4. Places R somewhere other than position 4.

A good candidate is “REIGN”:
- R is in position 1 (new position, not ruled out).
- E is in position 2 (new position, not ruled out).
- I, G, N are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
- No forbidden letters are used.

- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word and narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.
- DOES contain E, but not in the 5th position.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes E (but not as the last letter).
2. Excludes S, L, A, T.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is out and E is confirmed).

Let’s try “CHORE”:
- C, H, O, R are new letters.
- E is included and in a new position (4th).
- No S, L, A, T.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CHORE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) O(x) R(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, C, H, O  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: E, R  

So the secret word:
- Contains both E and R.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, C, H, O.
- E is not in position 4 or 5 (because in CHORE it was in position 4 and 5 respectively, and both were marked “-”).
- R is not in position 4 (because in CHORE it was in position 4 and was marked “-”).

Remaining common letters we can still use: N, D, G, B, F, I, U, M, P, Y, K, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses E and R.
2. Avoids all the letters already ruled out (S, L, A, T, C, H, O).
3. Places E somewhere other than positions 4 or 5.
4. Places R somewhere other than position 4.

A good candidate is “REIGN”:
- R is in position 1 (new position, not ruled out).
- E is in position 2 (new position, not ruled out).
- I, G, N are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.
- No forbidden letters are used.

Let’s try it.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)

Guess 3: REIGN -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) I(-) G(x) N(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's extract everything we now know from the three guesses:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word:  
   S, L, A, T, C, H, O, G

2. Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown):  
   E, R, I, N

3. Position constraints so far:
   - E cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5.  
   - R cannot be in positions 1 or 4.  
   - I cannot be in position 3.  
   - N cannot be in position 5.

4. Remaining unused common letters:  
   D, F, K, M, P, U, Y, B, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses only the letters E, R, I, N plus any of the still-unused common letters.  
- Respects all the position bans above.

Let’s list possible positions for each confirmed letter:

E: allowed in positions 1 or 3.  
R: allowed in positions 2, 3, or 5.  
I: allowed in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.  
N: allowed in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

A quick scan of common 5-letter words that fit these constraints and use only the allowed letters gives “INFER”:

- Letters: I, N, F, E, R  
- F is still unused and common.  
- Position check:  
  – I in 1 (allowed)  
  – N in 2 (allowed)  
  – F in 3 (unused)  
  – E in 4 → but E is banned from 4. Oops!  
So E cannot be in 4.

Next candidate: “NERVE” – but V is unused and it repeats E.  
“FIRED” – D is unused, but R is in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (banned).  
“PRIME” – P, M, E; but E in 5 (banned).  
“UNDER” – U is unused, but N in 1 (allowed), D in 2, E in 3 (allowed), R in 5 (allowed).  
Check letters: U, N, D, E, R.  
All letters are allowed (U is new, N, D, E, R are confirmed).  
Positions:  
U: no constraint.  
N: 1 (allowed).  
D: no constraint.  
E: 3 (allowed).  
R: 5 (allowed).  

“UNDER” satisfies every rule.

Guess 4: UNDER -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(✓) D(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback on UNDER:
- U(x) → U is NOT in the word.
- N(✓) → N is in the word and is in position 2.
- D(x) → D is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and is in position 4.
- R(✓) → R is in the word and is in position 5.

So the secret word has the pattern:
_ N _ E R

Letters confirmed so far: N (pos 2), E (pos 4), R (pos 5).

Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, T, C, H, O, G, U, D.

Letters still available (among common ones): B, F, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has N in position 2.
2. Has E in position 4.
3. Has R in position 5.
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
5. Has valid letters in positions 1 and 3 from the remaining pool.

Possible words fitting _ N _ E R:
- B N I E R → ""BNIER"" – not a valid word.
- F N I E R → ""FNIER"" – invalid.
- I N _ E R: I is allowed, but position 3 must be a valid letter. ""INFER"" – but F is allowed.  
  ""INFER"" is a valid English word and uses I in 1, N in 2, F in 3, E in 4, R in 5.  
  All letters are allowed (I, N, F, E, R), and none are ruled out.

Let's check constraints:
- Position 1: I is allowed (no bans on position 1 for I).
- Position 3: F is allowed (not yet used or banned).

Thus, ""INFER"" is a valid next guess.
