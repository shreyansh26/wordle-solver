For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. ""AROSE"" is a strong candidate because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter distribution for my first guess.

From the feedback on “arose”:

- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is not in position 1).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (so R is not in position 2).
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R.
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A and R.
- Does not have O, S, or E.
- A not in position 1, R not in position 2.

Good letters to try next: common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc., and remaining vowels I, U.

I’ll pick a word that places A and R in new positions and introduces other common letters.  
“TRAIN” comes to mind: it has T, R, A, I, N.  
- R is now in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2, so this is bad).  
Let me rethink.

Better choice: “CARTY” – but Y is less common.  
“RATIO” – but O is excluded.  
“RATIO” is out because of O.  
“RANCH” – but H is less common.  
“RANCH” also has C, H, N.  
Let me try “RANCH”:

- R is in position 1 (new position, not position 2).  
- A is in position 2 (new position, not position 1).  
- C, H, N are new letters.  
- No O, S, E.  

“RANCH” seems good.

Another option: “CRANK” – C, R, A, N, K.  
- R is in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2, so this is bad).  

“RANCH” is better.

I’ll go with “RANCH”.

- _ A _ _ R (R in position 5)

Good candidates:
- D A R K _ – but we need 5 letters, “DARK_” is 4.
- B A R G A – but G and second A might be okay, but “BARGA” is obscure.
- T A R D I – “TARDI” isn’t a word.
- L A R G E – but E is excluded.
- P A R K _ – “PARKE” has E, which is excluded.
- M A R V Y – “MARRY” has Y twice, but let’s see.
- G A R B A – “GARBA” is a word (a type of dance).
- B A R G A – same as above.

“GARBA” is a valid 5-letter word meaning a type of dance or a dance hall in India. It fits:
- A in position 2 (✓)
- R in position 3 (allowed, since R is not excluded from position 3)
- Contains no O, S, E, N, C, H
- Uses common letters G, B, A (A already known), but we need to check if G and B are okay – they aren’t excluded.

Another option: “MARRY” – but Y is allowed, and it has R in position 4. However, it has two Rs, which might not be optimal.

“TARRY” – same issue with two Rs and T, A, R, R, Y. Y is allowed, but two Rs is okay, but let’s see if we can find one with only one R.

“LARGE” – E is excluded.

“PAINT” – N is excluded.

“BAKED” – E, D – E excluded.

“BARED” – E, D – E excluded.

“MADAM” – M, A, D, A, M – but R is missing.

“GARLY” is a valid word (British slang for “garnish” or a variant of “garland”).

Let’s go with “GARLY”.

Check:
- G, A, R, L, Y – no O, S, E, N, C, H
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since R is not excluded from position 3)
- All letters are new except A and R which we know are in the word.",Guess 3: garly -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. ""AROSE"" is a strong candidate because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter distribution for my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:

- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is not in position 1).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (so R is not in position 2).
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R.
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A and R.
- Does not have O, S, or E.
- A not in position 1, R not in position 2.

Good letters to try next: common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc., and remaining vowels I, U.

I’ll pick a word that places A and R in new positions and introduces other common letters.  
“TRAIN” comes to mind: it has T, R, A, I, N.  
- R is now in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2, so this is bad).  
Let me rethink.

Better choice: “CARTY” – but Y is less common.  
“RATIO” – but O is excluded.  
“RATIO” is out because of O.  
“RANCH” – but H is less common.  
“RANCH” also has C, H, N.  
Let me try “RANCH”:

- R is in position 1 (new position, not position 2).  
- A is in position 2 (new position, not position 1).  
- C, H, N are new letters.  
- No O, S, E.  

“RANCH” seems good.

Another option: “CRANK” – C, R, A, N, K.  
- R is in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2, so this is bad).  

“RANCH” is better.

I’ll go with “RANCH”.

From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A and R are both in the word but not in their guessed positions.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. ranch → R(-) A(✓) N(x) C(x) H(x)
   - A is now in the correct position (position 2).
   - R is still in the word but not in position 1.
   - N, C, H are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word must be _ A _ _ _
- Contains R, but R is not in position 1 or 2 (from arose and ranch feedback).
- Cannot contain O, S, E, N, C, H.

Remaining common letters to try: T, L, D, M, P, I, U, B, G, K, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with A in position 2 and R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s brainstorm possibilities:
- _ A R _ _ (R in position 3)
- _ A _ R _ (R in position 4)
- _ A _ _ R (R in position 5)

Good candidates:
- D A R K _ – but we need 5 letters, “DARK_” is 4.
- B A R G A – but G and second A might be okay, but “BARGA” is obscure.
- T A R D I – “TARDI” isn’t a word.
- L A R G E – but E is excluded.
- P A R K _ – “PARKE” has E, which is excluded.
- M A R V Y – “MARRY” has Y twice, but let’s see.
- G A R B A – “GARBA” is a word (a type of dance).
- B A R G A – same as above.

“GARBA” is a valid 5-letter word meaning a type of dance or a dance hall in India. It fits:
- A in position 2 (✓)
- R in position 3 (allowed, since R is not excluded from position 3)
- Contains no O, S, E, N, C, H
- Uses common letters G, B, A (A already known), but we need to check if G and B are okay – they aren’t excluded.

Another option: “MARRY” – but Y is allowed, and it has R in position 4. However, it has two Rs, which might not be optimal.

“TARRY” – same issue with two Rs and T, A, R, R, Y. Y is allowed, but two Rs is okay, but let’s see if we can find one with only one R.

“LARGE” – E is excluded.

“PAINT” – N is excluded.

“BAKED” – E, D – E excluded.

“BARED” – E, D – E excluded.

“MADAM” – M, A, D, A, M – but R is missing.

We need a word with R in position 3, 4, or 5 and A in position 2.

Let’s try “DAMAR” – but M, A, R – but A is in position 2, R in position 5. D, A, M, A, R – but A is repeated, and we don’t know if letters can repeat.

“DAMAR” is a word (a type of wood), but not sure if it’s valid enough.

“PAPAW” – W is allowed, but no R.

“GAMAR” – not a word.

“TAMAR” – not a word.

“LAMAR” – not a word.

“VAMAR” – not a word.

“WAMAR” – not a word.

“YAMAR” – not a word.

“FARMS” – S is excluded.

“FARMY” – Y is allowed, but F, A, R, M, Y – R is in position 3. This seems valid.

“FARMY” is a valid word (variant spelling of “farms” or a surname).

Another option: “GARLY” – G, A, R, L, Y – R in position 3, A in position 2, no excluded letters.

“GARLY” is a valid word (British slang for “garnish” or a variant of “garland”).

- D A R K _ – but we need 5 letters, “DARK_” is 4.
- B A R G A – but G and second A might be okay, but “BARGA” is obscure.
- T A R D I – “TARDI” isn’t a word.
- L A R G E – but E is excluded.
- P A R K _ – “PARKE” has E, which is excluded.
- M A R V Y – “MARRY” has Y twice, but let’s see.
- G A R B A – “GARBA” is a word (a type of dance).
- B A R G A – same as above.

“GARBA” is a valid 5-letter word meaning a type of dance or a dance hall in India. It fits:
- A in position 2 (✓)
- R in position 3 (allowed, since R is not excluded from position 3)
- Contains no O, S, E, N, C, H
- Uses common letters G, B, A (A already known), but we need to check if G and B are okay – they aren’t excluded.

Another option: “MARRY” – but Y is allowed, and it has R in position 4. However, it has two Rs, which might not be optimal.

“TARRY” – same issue with two Rs and T, A, R, R, Y. Y is allowed, but two Rs is okay, but let’s see if we can find one with only one R.

“LARGE” – E is excluded.

“PAINT” – N is excluded.

“BAKED” – E, D – E excluded.

“BARED” – E, D – E excluded.

“MADAM” – M, A, D, A, M – but R is missing.

We need a word with R in position 3, 4, or 5 and A in position 2.

Let’s try “DAMAR” – but M, A, R – but A is in position 2, R in position 5. D, A, M, A, R – but A is repeated, and we don’t know if letters can repeat.

“DAMAR” is a word (a type of wood), but not sure if it’s valid enough.

“PAPAW” – W is allowed, but no R.

“GAMAR” – not a word.

“TAMAR” – not a word.

“LAMAR” – not a word.

“VAMAR” – not a word.

“WAMAR” – not a word.

“YAMAR” – not a word.

“FARMS” – S is excluded.

“FARMY” – Y is allowed, but F, A, R, M, Y – R is in position 3. This seems valid.

“FARMY” is a valid word (variant spelling of “farms” or a surname).

Another option: “GARLY” – G, A, R, L, Y – R in position 3, A in position 2, no excluded letters.

“GARLY” is a valid word (British slang for “garnish” or a variant of “garland”).

Between “FARMY” and “GARLY”, both fit, but “GARLY” uses G, L, Y which are all new letters, giving more information.

Let’s go with “GARLY”.

Check:
- G, A, R, L, Y – no O, S, E, N, C, H
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since R is not excluded from position 3)
- All letters are new except A and R which we know are in the word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ranch -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) N(x) C(x) H(x)
Guess 3: garly -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(✓) R(✓) L(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on “garly”:

- G(x) – G is not in the word.
- A(✓) – A is in the correct position (position 2).
- R(✓) – R is in the correct position (position 3).
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- Y(✓) – Y is in the correct position (position 5).

So the word structure is now: _ A R _ Y

Letters we know are in the word: A (pos 2), R (pos 3), Y (pos 5).

Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, S, E, N, C, H, G, L.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, K, M, P, T, V, W, Z.

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4, chosen from the remaining consonants.

Possible combinations:
- Position 1: B, D, F, K, M, P, T, V, W
- Position 4: B, D, F, K, M, P, T, V, W (can repeat? Probably not, since we haven’t seen duplicates yet)

Let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting _ A R _ Y:

- B A R B Y – but B is repeated and “barby” is a name, not sure if valid
- B A R D Y – “bar dy” not a word
- B A R F Y – not a word
- D A R K Y – “darker” without E, but “darker” has E excluded
- D A R M Y – not a word
- F A R C Y – C is excluded
- F A R M Y – “farmy” not a word
- M A R V Y – “marvy” not a word
- P A R K Y – “parky” is a word (British slang for “parked”)
- T A R P Y – “tarpy” not a word
- V A R V Y – not a word
- W A R M Y – “warmy” not a word

The best valid word seems to be “parky”.

Check:
- P, A, R, K, Y
- A (pos 2), R (pos 3), Y (pos 5) all correct
- P and K are new letters, giving maximum information
- No excluded letters (O, S, E, N, C, H, G, L)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants. ""AROSE"" is a strong candidate because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter distribution for my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:

- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is not in position 1).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (so R is not in position 2).
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R.
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A and R.
- Does not have O, S, or E.
- A not in position 1, R not in position 2.

Good letters to try next: common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc., and remaining vowels I, U.

I’ll pick a word that places A and R in new positions and introduces other common letters.  
“TRAIN” comes to mind: it has T, R, A, I, N.  
- R is now in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2, so this is bad).  
Let me rethink.

Better choice: “CARTY” – but Y is less common.  
“RATIO” – but O is excluded.  
“RATIO” is out because of O.  
“RANCH” – but H is less common.  
“RANCH” also has C, H, N.  
Let me try “RANCH”:

- R is in position 1 (new position, not position 2).  
- A is in position 2 (new position, not position 1).  
- C, H, N are new letters.  
- No O, S, E.  

“RANCH” seems good.

Another option: “CRANK” – C, R, A, N, K.  
- R is in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2, so this is bad).  

“RANCH” is better.

I’ll go with “RANCH”.

   - A is now in the correct position (position 2).
   - R is still in the word but not in position 1.
   - N, C, H are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word must be _ A _ _ _
- Contains R, but R is not in position 1 or 2 (from arose and ranch feedback).
- Cannot contain O, S, E, N, C, H.

Remaining common letters to try: T, L, D, M, P, I, U, B, G, K, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with A in position 2 and R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s brainstorm possibilities:
- _ A R _ _ (R in position 3)
- _ A _ R _ (R in position 4)
- _ A _ _ R (R in position 5)

Good candidates:
- D A R K _ – but we need 5 letters, “DARK_” is 4.
- B A R G A – but G and second A might be okay, but “BARGA” is obscure.
- T A R D I – “TARDI” isn’t a word.
- L A R G E – but E is excluded.
- P A R K _ – “PARKE” has E, which is excluded.
- M A R V Y – “MARRY” has Y twice, but let’s see.
- G A R B A – “GARBA” is a word (a type of dance).
- B A R G A – same as above.

“GARBA” is a valid 5-letter word meaning a type of dance or a dance hall in India. It fits:
- A in position 2 (✓)
- R in position 3 (allowed, since R is not excluded from position 3)
- Contains no O, S, E, N, C, H
- Uses common letters G, B, A (A already known), but we need to check if G and B are okay – they aren’t excluded.

Another option: “MARRY” – but Y is allowed, and it has R in position 4. However, it has two Rs, which might not be optimal.

“TARRY” – same issue with two Rs and T, A, R, R, Y. Y is allowed, but two Rs is okay, but let’s see if we can find one with only one R.

“LARGE” – E is excluded.

“PAINT” – N is excluded.

“BAKED” – E, D – E excluded.

“BARED” – E, D – E excluded.

“MADAM” – M, A, D, A, M – but R is missing.

We need a word with R in position 3, 4, or 5 and A in position 2.

Let’s try “DAMAR” – but M, A, R – but A is in position 2, R in position 5. D, A, M, A, R – but A is repeated, and we don’t know if letters can repeat.

“DAMAR” is a word (a type of wood), but not sure if it’s valid enough.

“PAPAW” – W is allowed, but no R.

“GAMAR” – not a word.

“TAMAR” – not a word.

“LAMAR” – not a word.

“VAMAR” – not a word.

“WAMAR” – not a word.

“YAMAR” – not a word.

“FARMS” – S is excluded.

“FARMY” – Y is allowed, but F, A, R, M, Y – R is in position 3. This seems valid.

“FARMY” is a valid word (variant spelling of “farms” or a surname).

Another option: “GARLY” – G, A, R, L, Y – R in position 3, A in position 2, no excluded letters.

“GARLY” is a valid word (British slang for “garnish” or a variant of “garland”).

Between “FARMY” and “GARLY”, both fit, but “GARLY” uses G, L, Y which are all new letters, giving more information.

Let’s go with “GARLY”.

Check:
- G, A, R, L, Y – no O, S, E, N, C, H
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since R is not excluded from position 3)
- All letters are new except A and R which we know are in the word.

From the new feedback on “garly”:

- G(x) – G is not in the word.
- A(✓) – A is in the correct position (position 2).
- R(✓) – R is in the correct position (position 3).
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- Y(✓) – Y is in the correct position (position 5).

So the word structure is now: _ A R _ Y

Letters we know are in the word: A (pos 2), R (pos 3), Y (pos 5).

Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, S, E, N, C, H, G, L.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, K, M, P, T, V, W, Z.

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4, chosen from the remaining consonants.

Possible combinations:
- Position 1: B, D, F, K, M, P, T, V, W
- Position 4: B, D, F, K, M, P, T, V, W (can repeat? Probably not, since we haven’t seen duplicates yet)

Let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting _ A R _ Y:

- B A R B Y – but B is repeated and “barby” is a name, not sure if valid
- B A R D Y – “bar dy” not a word
- B A R F Y – not a word
- D A R K Y – “darker” without E, but “darker” has E excluded
- D A R M Y – not a word
- F A R C Y – C is excluded
- F A R M Y – “farmy” not a word
- M A R V Y – “marvy” not a word
- P A R K Y – “parky” is a word (British slang for “parked”)
- T A R P Y – “tarpy” not a word
- V A R V Y – not a word
- W A R M Y – “warmy” not a word

The best valid word seems to be “parky”.

Check:
- P, A, R, K, Y
- A (pos 2), R (pos 3), Y (pos 5) all correct
- P and K are new letters, giving maximum information
- No excluded letters (O, S, E, N, C, H, G, L)

From the feedback so far:

- Word pattern: _ A R _ Y (A, R, Y are locked in positions 2, 3, 5)
- Letters already ruled out: O, S, E, N, C, H, G, L, P, K
- Remaining consonants for positions 1 and 4: B, D, F, M, T, V, W, Z

We need a 5-letter word of the form ? A R ? Y using only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
1. B A R B Y – invalid (B repeated and “barby” is a name)
2. B A R D Y – “bar dy” not a word
3. B A R F Y – not a word
4. D A R M Y – not a word
5. F A R M Y – “farmy” not a word
6. M A R V Y – “marvy” not a word
7. T A R V Y – “tarvy” not a word
8. W A R M Y – “warmy” not a word
9. D A R V Y – “darvy” not a word

The only common English word that fits is “barry” (but it repeats B and is a name). However, “barry” is 5 letters and fits _ A R _ Y.

Wait – let’s check “barry”:
- B A R R Y – pattern _ A R _ Y matches (positions 1=B, 2=A, 3=R, 4=R, 5=Y)
- Letters used: B, A, R, Y – all allowed
- R is allowed to appear twice (no information against duplicates)

“Barry” is a valid English name and the only remaining common word that fits.

Therefore, the next guess is “barry”.
