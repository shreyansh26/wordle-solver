For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct letters that covers as many of these common letters as possible.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to see what might be in the secret word.

Remaining common letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, plus D (which we know is present).

We need a 5-letter word with:
1. O in position 2.

Looking at remaining letters, ""GODLY"" seems valid:
- G, O, D, L, Y – but L is eliminated.
Next, ""MODY"" isn't a word. ""BOUND"" has U. ""HODAD"" has A. 

Wait, let's list remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, plus D.

Best candidate: ""GODLY"" is invalid due to L. Next, ""MODY"" isn't a word. 

Another approach: D must be in positions 1, 3, or 4. Let's try D in position 1:
- D O _ _ _ : Possible words: DOGMY (invalid), DOUGH (U eliminated), DOUBT (U, T eliminated), etc. None seem valid.

D in position 3:
- _ O D _ _ : Possible words: B O D G Y (BOODY? No), F O D J Y (invalid), H O D G Y (HODGY? Not a word), M O D G Y (MODGY? Not a word), V O D K Y (invalid).

- _ O _ D _ : Possible words: B O G D Y (BOG DY? Not a word), F O G D Y (invalid), H O G D Y (invalid), M O G D Y (invalid), V O G D Y (invalid), etc.

Hmm, struggling to find valid words. Let me reconsider. Maybe ""GODLY"" is the best fit despite L being eliminated – but L is eliminated. 

Wait, ""BOUND"" has U (eliminated), ""MOUTH"" has U. ""FOGGY"" has G, G, Y, but no D. 

Let me try ""MODY"" – not a word. ""WODGE"" has E (eliminated). 

Actually, ""GODLY"" is the closest, but L is eliminated. Next, ""MODY"" isn't valid. 

Another candidate: ""BODGY"" – B, O, D, G, Y. All letters are allowed (B, O, D, G, Y not in the eliminated set). 

""BODGY"" is a valid word meaning plump or corpulent. It fits:
- O in position 2 (✓)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct letters that covers as many of these common letters as possible.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to see what might be in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.
- Contains O, but not in the 3rd position.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses O in a different position (not 3rd).
2. Avoids A, R, S, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

A strong candidate is ""POINT"":
- P, O, I, N, T – none are A, R, S, E.
- O is in position 2 (not 3), testing a new spot.
- Uses common letters P, I, N, T to gather more clues.

I want a word that:
1. Has O in the 2nd position.
2. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is ""COULD"":
- C, O, U, L, D – none are in the eliminated set.

Looking at remaining letters, ""GODLY"" seems valid:

Next, ""MODY"" isn't a word. ""BOUND"" has U. ""HODAD"" has A. 

Wait, let's list remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, plus D.

Best candidate: ""GODLY"" is invalid due to L. Next, ""MODY"" isn't a word. 

Another approach: D must be in positions 1, 3, or 4. Let's try D in position 1:
- D O _ _ _ : Possible words: DOGMY (invalid), DOUGH (U eliminated), DOUBT (U, T eliminated), etc. None seem valid.

Hmm, struggling to find valid words. Let me reconsider. Maybe ""GODLY"" is the best fit despite L being eliminated – but L is eliminated. 

Wait, ""BOUND"" has U (eliminated), ""MOUTH"" has U. ""FOGGY"" has G, G, Y, but no D. 

Let me try ""MODY"" – not a word. ""WODGE"" has E (eliminated).

Another candidate: ""BODGY"" – B, O, D, G, Y. All letters are allowed (B, O, D, G, Y not in the eliminated set).

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe D is in position 1: D O _ _ Y. The only valid word I can think of is ""DOXY"" but it's 4 letters. ""DOZEN"" has Z, N (N eliminated). ""DOUGH"" has U (eliminated). 

Wait, ""DOWDY"" - D, O, W, D, Y. All letters allowed (D, O, W, Y). O is in position 2, Y in 5, D in 1 and 4. But D can't be in 3rd, but can be in 1st or 4th. ""DOWDY"" has D in 1st and 4th. This seems valid.

""DOWDY"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning dowdy or plain-looking.

Let's check:
- D in 1st position (allowed)
- O in 2nd (correct)

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe D is in position 1: D O _ _ Y. The only valid word I can think of is ""DOXY"" but it's 4 letters. ""DOZEN"" has Z, N (N eliminated). ""DOUGH"" has U (eliminated). 

Wait, ""DOWDY"" - D, O, W, D, Y. All letters allowed (D, O, W, Y). O is in position 2, Y in 5, D in 1 and 4. But D can't be in 3rd, but can be in 1st or 4th. ""DOWDY"" has D in 1st and 4th. This seems valid.

""DOWDY"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning dowdy or plain-looking.

Let's check:
- D in 1st position (allowed)
- O in 2nd (correct)
- W untested
- D in 4th (allowed)
- Y in 5th (correct)

This seems like the best candidate.",Guess 5: dowdy -> FEEDBACK: D(-) O(✓) W(✓) D(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct letters that covers as many of these common letters as possible.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to see what might be in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.
- Contains O, but not in the 3rd position.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses O in a different position (not 3rd).
2. Avoids A, R, S, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

A strong candidate is ""POINT"":
- P, O, I, N, T – none are A, R, S, E.
- O is in position 2 (not 3), testing a new spot.
- Uses common letters P, I, N, T to gather more clues.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ""point"":
- P, I, N, T are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word AND in the correct 2nd position (✓).

So the secret word looks like: _ O _ _ _

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T.

Remaining common letters to try: C, L, U, M, D, G, B, F, H, K, Y, V, W, etc.

I want a word that:
1. Has O in the 2nd position.
2. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is ""COULD"":
- C, O, U, L, D – none are in the eliminated set.
- O is in position 2 (confirmed correct).
- Uses C, U, L, D which are all common and untested.

From the new feedback on ""could"":
- C, U, L are NOT in the word (x).
- O is still in the correct 2nd position (✓).
- D is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word looks like: _ O _ _ _ and must contain D somewhere other than the 5th position.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, L.

Remaining common letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, plus D (which we know is present).

We need a 5-letter word with:
1. O in position 2.
2. D somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
3. Only letters from the allowed set.

Possible patterns:
- D O _ _ _
- _ O D _ _
- _ O _ D _

Good candidates:
- BOUND – but U is eliminated.
- GODLY – but G is untested, Y is untested.
- MOUTH – U is eliminated.
- FOLLY – L is eliminated.
- WODGE – G, E, Z (E is eliminated).
- MODUS – S is eliminated.
- BODGE – B, G, E (E eliminated).

Looking at remaining letters, ""GODLY"" seems valid:
- G, O, D, L, Y – but L is eliminated.
Next, ""MODY"" isn't a word. ""BOUND"" has U. ""HODAD"" has A. 

Wait, let's list remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, plus D.

Best candidate: ""GODLY"" is invalid due to L. Next, ""MODY"" isn't a word. 

Another approach: D must be in positions 1, 3, or 4. Let's try D in position 1:
- D O _ _ _ : Possible words: DOGMY (invalid), DOUGH (U eliminated), DOUBT (U, T eliminated), etc. None seem valid.

D in position 3:
- _ O D _ _ : Possible words: B O D G Y (BOODY? No), F O D J Y (invalid), H O D G Y (HODGY? Not a word), M O D G Y (MODGY? Not a word), V O D K Y (invalid).

D in position 4:
- _ O _ D _ : Possible words: B O G D Y (BOG DY? Not a word), F O G D Y (invalid), H O G D Y (invalid), M O G D Y (invalid), V O G D Y (invalid), etc.

Hmm, struggling to find valid words. Let me reconsider. Maybe ""GODLY"" is the best fit despite L being eliminated – but L is eliminated. 

Wait, ""BOUND"" has U (eliminated), ""MOUTH"" has U. ""FOGGY"" has G, G, Y, but no D. 

Let me try ""MODY"" – not a word. ""WODGE"" has E (eliminated). 

Actually, ""GODLY"" is the closest, but L is eliminated. Next, ""MODY"" isn't valid. 

Another candidate: ""BODGY"" – B, O, D, G, Y. All letters are allowed (B, O, D, G, Y not in the eliminated set). 

""BODGY"" is a valid word meaning plump or corpulent. It fits:
- O in position 2 (✓)
- D in position 3 (not 5th, so possible)
- Uses B, G, Y which are untested.

Let's use ""BODGY"".

- O is in the correct 2nd position (✓).
- D is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (-).
- Y is in the word and in the correct 5th position (✓).

So the secret word looks like: _ O _ _ Y
and must contain D somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but not 3, so positions 1, 3, or 4).

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, L, B, G.

Remaining common letters: D, F, H, J, K, M, V, W, plus any others not eliminated.

We need a 5-letter word with:
1. O in position 2.
2. Y in position 5.
3. D in position 1, 3, or 4.
4. Only letters from the allowed set.

Possible patterns:
- D O _ _ Y (D in 1st)
- _ O D _ Y (D in 3rd)
- _ O _ D Y (D in 4th)

Let's check each:

1. D O _ _ Y: Possible words - DOXY? (but X is allowed? Wait, X wasn't eliminated. But ""DOXY"" is a word. However, X wasn't tested yet. But we have no info on X yet. But we know D, O, Y are correct. But we need to check if X is allowed. Since X wasn't eliminated, it's possible. But ""DOXY"" is 4 letters. Need 5. ""DOZEN"" has Z, N (N eliminated). ""DOUGH"" has U (eliminated). ""DOUBT"" has U, T (eliminated). So no valid 5-letter words here.

2. _ O D _ Y: Possible words - F O D D Y (invalid), H O D D Y (invalid), M O D D Y (invalid), V O D D Y (invalid), F O D J Y (invalid), etc. Not finding valid words.

3. _ O _ D Y: Possible words - F O K D Y (invalid), H O K D Y (invalid), M O K D Y (invalid), V O K D Y (invalid), F O M D Y (invalid), H O M D Y (invalid), M O M D Y (invalid), V O M D Y (invalid), etc. Not finding valid words.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe D is in position 1: D O _ _ Y. The only valid word I can think of is ""DOXY"" but it's 4 letters. ""DOZEN"" has Z, N (N eliminated). ""DOUGH"" has U (eliminated). 

Wait, ""DOWDY"" - D, O, W, D, Y. All letters allowed (D, O, W, Y). O is in position 2, Y in 5, D in 1 and 4. But D can't be in 3rd, but can be in 1st or 4th. ""DOWDY"" has D in 1st and 4th. This seems valid.

""DOWDY"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning dowdy or plain-looking.

Let's check:
- D in 1st position (allowed)
- O in 2nd (correct)
- W untested
- D in 4th (allowed)
- Y in 5th (correct)

This seems like the best candidate.
