### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- Two very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain

This will help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word, providing a strong foundation for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was first, so it must appear later).
- R, O, S are NOT in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was fifth, so it must appear earlier).

So the secret word:
- Contains A and E, but not in their original spots (A not 1st, E not 5th).
- Does NOT contain R, O, S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and E (but A not 1st, E not 5th).
2. Avoids R, O, S.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

A good next word would use the remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, C, etc. Let me think of a word that fits these constraints and provides new letters to test.

""alien"" comes to mind:
- A is in position 2 (not 1st, satisfies feedback).
- E is in position 4 (not 5th, satisfies feedback).
- Uses L, I, N (common letters not yet tested).
- Avoids R, O, S.

This seems like a strong second guess to narrow down possibilities.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, O, S, I, N  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: A, E, L  

So the secret word:
- contains A, E, L
- does NOT contain R, O, S, I, N
- A is not in position 1 (from arose) and not in position 1 (from alien) → A must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5
- E is not in position 5 (from arose) and not in position 4 (from alien) → E must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4
- L is not in position 2 (from alien) → L must be in 1, 3, 4, or 5

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A, E, L exactly once each.
2. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (so no R, O, S, I, N).
3. Respects the positional constraints above.

Remaining common consonants we can still use: T, C, D, G, B, M, P, F, H, K, Y, W, U, V, X, Z, Q, J

Let’s look for a word that fits these constraints. One candidate is “TALKE”:
- T (new letter)
- A (must be used)
- L (must be used)
- K (new letter)
- E (must be used)

Check constraints:
- Contains A, E, L → OK
- Does not contain R, O, S, I, N → OK
- A is in position 2 → allowed (positions 2,3,4,5)
- E is in position 5 → but we know E is NOT in position 5 → conflict → discard

Next candidate: “CLEAT”
- C (new)
- L (must be used)
- E (must be used)
- A (must be used)
- T (new)

Check constraints:
- Contains C, L, E, A, T → OK (all allowed)
- A is in position 4 → allowed
- E is in position 3 → allowed
- L is in position 2 → but we know L is not in position 2 → conflict → discard

Next candidate: “LEAPT”

- E (must be used)
- A (must be used)
- P (new)
- T (new)

Check constraints:
- Contains L, E, A → OK

- A is in position 3 → allowed
- E is in position 2 → allowed
- L is in position 1 → allowed (positions 1,3,4,5)

Check constraints:
- Contains A, E, L → OK
- Does not contain R, O, S, I, N → OK
- A is in position 2 → allowed (positions 2,3,4,5)
- E is in position 5 → but we know E is NOT in position 5 → conflict → discard

Next candidate: “CLEAT”
- C (new)
- L (must be used)
- E (must be used)
- A (must be used)
- T (new)

Check constraints:
- Contains C, L, E, A, T → OK (all allowed)
- A is in position 4 → allowed
- E is in position 3 → allowed
- L is in position 2 → but we know L is not in position 2 → conflict → discard

Next candidate: “LEAPT”
- L (must be used)
- E (must be used)
- A (must be used)
- P (new)
- T (new)

Check constraints:
- Contains L, E, A → OK
- Does not contain R, O, S, I, N → OK
- A is in position 3 → allowed
- E is in position 2 → allowed
- L is in position 1 → allowed (positions 1,3,4,5)
- New letters P and T are fine.

This seems valid. Let’s go with “LEAPT”.

From the new feedback on “leapt”:
- L is in the word and in the correct position 1.
- E is in the word and in the correct position 2.
- A is in the word and in the correct position 3.
- P and T are NOT in the word.

So the secret word looks like: L E A _ _

Letters still unknown: positions 4 and 5.

Known constraints:
- Letters already placed: L, E, A (positions 1, 2, 3).
- Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, I, N, P, T.
- Remaining possible letters (from the alphabet excluding the ruled-out ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with “LEA” and uses only allowed letters in positions 4 and 5.

Common English words starting with “LEA”:
- LEAKY
- LEARN (but N is ruled out)
- LEAVE (but V and E are allowed, but E is already used in position 2)
- LEAPT (but P and T are ruled out)
- LEANS (N is ruled out)
- LEACH (but C and H are allowed)

“LEAKY” uses K and Y, both allowed.
“LEACH” uses C and H, both allowed.

Between these, “LEAKY” is more common. Let’s try it.

Check:
- L E A K Y
- Positions 1-3 correct (from feedback).
- K and Y have not been tested or ruled out.
- No disallowed letters.

This seems like the most straightforward next guess.
