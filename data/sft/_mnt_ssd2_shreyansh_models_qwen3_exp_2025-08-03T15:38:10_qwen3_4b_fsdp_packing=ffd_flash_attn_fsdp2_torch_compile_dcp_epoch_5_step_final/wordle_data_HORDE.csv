### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like S, T, R, N, L. A good first guess should also avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters. One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters to work with and will likely provide useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that avoids S, L, A, T. Good consonants to try next are R, N, C, D, M, P, B, G, etc. We should also include other vowels like I, O, U.

Possible candidates:
- CRONE (but has A, which we know is out)
- PRONE (P, R, O, N, E) – no S, L, A, T, and ends with E.
- BROKE (B, R, O, K, E) – same constraints.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)

   - Letters S, L, A, T are not in the word.

2. PRONE → P(x) R(-) O(-) N(x) E(✓)
   - P and N are not in the word (x).
   - R and O are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, P, N.
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, O, E.
- E is in the 5th position (fixed).
- R and O are somewhere in positions 1-4, but not where they appeared in PRONE (R was position 2, O was position 3).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing R and O, and avoiding S, L, A, T, P, N.

- R could be in positions 1, 3, 4 (not 2).
- O could be in positions 1, 2, 4 (not 3).

Let's think of words:

- ""FORGE"" – F, O, R, G, E – ends with E, has R and O, no forbidden letters.
- ""GROPE"" – G, R, O, P, E – but P is forbidden.
- ""CRORE"" – C, R, O, R, E – has R twice, but is valid, but might be less common.
- ""WORKE"" – not a valid English word.
- ""FORGE"" seems valid and fits all constraints.

Check FORGE:

- Ends with E.
- Contains R and O in new positions (R is 3rd, O is 2nd – previously R was 2nd, O was 3rd in PRONE, so this is valid).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like S, T, R, N, L. A good first guess should also avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters. One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters to work with and will likely provide useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct final position (✓).

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain S, L, A, T.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that avoids S, L, A, T. Good consonants to try next are R, N, C, D, M, P, B, G, etc. We should also include other vowels like I, O, U.

Possible candidates:
- CRONE (but has A, which we know is out)
- PRONE (P, R, O, N, E) – no S, L, A, T, and ends with E.
- BROKE (B, R, O, K, E) – same constraints.
- CHORE (C, H, O, R, E) – good letters.

""PRONE"" seems like a strong next guess as it introduces P, R, O, N while keeping E in place.

<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
   - Word ends with E.
   - Letters S, L, A, T are not in the word.

2. PRONE → P(x) R(-) O(-) N(x) E(✓)
   - P and N are not in the word (x).
   - R and O are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, P, N.
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, O, E.
- E is in the 5th position (fixed).
- R and O are somewhere in positions 1-4, but not where they appeared in PRONE (R was position 2, O was position 3).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing R and O, and avoiding S, L, A, T, P, N.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's try to place R and O in new positions:
- R could be in positions 1, 3, 4 (not 2).
- O could be in positions 1, 2, 4 (not 3).

Let's think of words:
- ""CORER"" – but ends with R, not E.
- ""FORGE"" – F, O, R, G, E – ends with E, has R and O, no forbidden letters.
- ""GROPE"" – G, R, O, P, E – but P is forbidden.
- ""CRORE"" – C, R, O, R, E – has R twice, but is valid, but might be less common.
- ""WORKE"" – not a valid English word.
- ""FORGE"" seems valid and fits all constraints.

Check FORGE:
- Letters: F, O, R, G, E.
- No S, L, A, T, P, N.
- Ends with E.
- Contains R and O in new positions (R is 3rd, O is 2nd – previously R was 2nd, O was 3rd in PRONE, so this is valid).

Therefore, FORGE is a good next guess.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like S, T, R, N, L. A good first guess should also avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters. One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters to work with and will likely provide useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- S, L, A, T are not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct final position (✓).

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain S, L, A, T.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that avoids S, L, A, T. Good consonants to try next are R, N, C, D, M, P, B, G, etc. We should also include other vowels like I, O, U.

Possible candidates:
- CRONE (but has A, which we know is out)
- PRONE (P, R, O, N, E) – no S, L, A, T, and ends with E.
- BROKE (B, R, O, K, E) – same constraints.
- CHORE (C, H, O, R, E) – good letters.

""PRONE"" seems like a strong next guess as it introduces P, R, O, N while keeping E in place.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PRONE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(-) O(-) N(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
   - Word ends with E.
   - Letters S, L, A, T are not in the word.

2. PRONE → P(x) R(-) O(-) N(x) E(✓)
   - P and N are not in the word (x).
   - R and O are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, P, N.
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, O, E.
- E is in the 5th position (fixed).
- R and O are somewhere in positions 1-4, but not where they appeared in PRONE (R was position 2, O was position 3).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing R and O, and avoiding S, L, A, T, P, N.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's try to place R and O in new positions:
- R could be in positions 1, 3, 4 (not 2).
- O could be in positions 1, 2, 4 (not 3).

Let's think of words:
- ""CORER"" – but ends with R, not E.
- ""FORGE"" – F, O, R, G, E – ends with E, has R and O, no forbidden letters.
- ""GROPE"" – G, R, O, P, E – but P is forbidden.
- ""CRORE"" – C, R, O, R, E – has R twice, but is valid, but might be less common.
- ""WORKE"" – not a valid English word.
- ""FORGE"" seems valid and fits all constraints.

Check FORGE:
- Letters: F, O, R, G, E.
- No S, L, A, T, P, N.
- Ends with E.
- Contains R and O in new positions (R is 3rd, O is 2nd – previously R was 2nd, O was 3rd in PRONE, so this is valid).

Therefore, FORGE is a good next guess.

Guess 3: FORGE -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(✓) R(✓) G(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three pieces of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - S, L, A, T are not in the word.

2. PRONE → P(x) R(-) O(-) N(x) E(✓)
   - P and N are not in the word.
   - R and O are in the word but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

3. FORGE → F(x) O(✓) R(✓) G(x) E(✓)
   - F and G are not in the word.
   - O is now confirmed in position 2.
   - R is confirmed in position 3.
   - E is confirmed in position 5.

Current known pattern: _ O R _ E
Known letters not in the word: S, L, A, T, P, N, F, G

We need a 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ O R _ E and uses only the remaining letters.

Remaining letters: B, C, D, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not ruled out).

Let's think of words fitting _ O R _ E:
- BORNE – but N is ruled out.
- CROME – C, R, O, M, E – but G is ruled out (CROME has G? No, CROME is C, R, O, M, E – G isn't in it. Wait, FORGE had G(x), so G is out, but CROME is C, R, O, M, E. Let me check: C, R, O, M, E – none of S, L, A, T, P, N, F, G. This seems valid. But does CROME exist? It's a variant spelling of ""crown,"" but might be obscure.

- DROME – not a standard word.
- CRORE – C, R, O, R, E – uses R twice, but is valid (though rare).
- WORKE – not a standard word.
- CORVE – C, O, R, V, E – fits! C, O, R, V, E – none of the forbidden letters, and it fits _ O R _ E.

CORVE:
- Position 1: C (not ruled out)
- Position 2: O (confirmed)
- Position 3: R (confirmed)
- Position 4: V (not ruled out)
- Position 5: E (confirmed)

This seems like the best next guess.

- MURKE – M, U, K ruled out  
- PROBE – P, B ruled out  
- TORSE – T ruled out  
- WORSE – S ruled out

- DORSE – obscure and not standard.  
- Actually, checking the Scrabble list again, the only remaining common word is:

Wait, let’s list all valid ? O R ? E words and cross out the ruled-out ones:

- BORNE – N ruled out  
- CHORE – C ruled out  
- DORSE – obscure  
- HORSE – S ruled out  
- JORGE – G ruled out  
- MURKE – M, U, K ruled out  
- PROBE – P ruled out  
- TORSE – T ruled out  
- WORSE – S ruled out  

The only remaining standard word is:

- DORSE – though rare, it is listed (archaic form of “dorse” meaning the back or ridge of a hill).  
- Alternatively, “DORSE” is accepted in some word lists.

Hence, the only plausible guess left is DORSE.

Therefore, the next guess must be DORSE.",Guess 6: DORSE -> FEEDBACK: D(-) O(✓) R(✓) S(x) E(✓),FAIL
