### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these to maximize information gain. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers both vowels and consonants. This should give me good feedback on multiple letters and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word and correct position (✓) at position 5

So we know:
1. Word ends with E.
2. Contains R and O, but not in positions 2 or 3 respectively.
3. Does not contain A or S.

Next guess should incorporate the known letters (R, O, E) and test new common letters. Also need to avoid positions already ruled out for R and O. Good candidates: T, L, N, I, C, D. I'll try ""TROPE"" - it has T, R, O, P, E. Positions: R in 2 (was position 2 in AROSE, so this is invalid because R cannot be in position 2). Adjusting, ""CRONE"" has C, R, O, N, E - R is in position 2 again (invalid). ""ORCLE"" - invalid, has C but positions are off. ""TOWER"" - has T, O, W, E, R - but O was in position 3 in AROSE, and feedback said O is in word but wrong position, so position 3 is invalid for O. In ""TOWER"", O is in position 2 - that's allowed. Also includes T and W which are common. This seems good.

But let me check if TOWER has any conflicts:
- E is in position 4, but we know E must be in position 5 - conflict. So TOWER is invalid.

Next: ""ROTER"" - but has R in position 1 and 4, but E must be in 5. Also, R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE). This has R in 1 and 4 - position 1 is new, but R cannot be in 2 (which it isn't here). However, ""ROTER"" has R in 1 and 4, but we don't know if R appears once or multiple times. Also, O is in position 2 - but from AROSE, O was in position 3 and feedback said O is in word but wrong position, so position 2 is allowed for O. But ""ROTER"" has O in position 2, which was not ruled out. However, this seems less optimal because it repeats R.

Better approach: use new letters and place R and O in allowed positions. Let's try ""CRONE"":
- C: new
- R: position 2 - but from AROSE, R was in position 2 and got ""-"", meaning R is in word but not in position 2. So R cannot be in position 2 - CRONE has R in 2 - invalid.

Next: ""DRONE"" - D, R, O, N, E. R is in position 2 - again invalid.

Next: ""FROND"" - but E must be in position 5, so this is invalid.

Next: ""INORE"" - I, N, O, R, E. R is in position 4 (allowed), O is in position 3 (but from AROSE, O was in position 3 and got ""-"", so O cannot be in position 3 - invalid).

Next: ""ORNIE"" - O in position 1 (allowed), R in position 2 (invalid, same as above).

Next: ""TROPE"" - T, R, O, P, E. R in 2 (invalid), O in 3 (invalid).

Next: ""PROBE"" - P, R, O, B, E. R in 2 (invalid), O in 3 (invalid).

Next: ""BROKE"" - B, R, O, K, E. R in 2 (invalid), O in 3 (invalid).

Next: ""GROPE"" - G, R, O, P, E. R in 2 (invalid), O in 3 (invalid).

Next: ""FROZE"" - F, R, O, Z, E. R in 2 (invalid), O in 3 (invalid).

Next: ""CRORE"" - C, R, O, R, E. R in 2 and 4, O in 3 - all invalid positions.

This is tricky. Need to place R and O in positions they haven't been in yet. From AROSE:
- R was in position 2 (invalid)
- O was in position 3 (invalid)
- E must be in position 5

So R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (but 5 is E), so 1, 3, 4
O can be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (but 5 is E), so 1, 2, 4

Let's try ""TOWER"" again - but E must be in 5, so ""TOWER"" is invalid.

Next: ""TROPE"" - invalid positions.

Next: ""ROUGE"" - R in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), U in 3, G in 4, E in 5 (correct). This seems valid:
- R in 1 (not ruled out)
- O in 2 (not ruled out)
- E in 5 (correct)
- New letters U and G to test

This looks good.
