For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and common consonants.

2. O is NOT in position 3, so it must be 1, 2, 4, or 5.
3. N is NOT in position 4, so it must be 1, 2, 3, or 5.
4. C is NOT in position 5, so it must be 1, 2, 3, or 4.
5. Letters A, R, S, E, T, I are excluded.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses only letters not yet excluded (so no A, R, S, E, T, I).
- Must contain O, N, and C.
- Must place O, N, C in positions they are allowed to be in.

Possible positions:
- O: 1, 2, 4, 5
- N: 1, 2, 3, 5
- C: 1, 2, 3, 4

Let's try to find a word that satisfies these constraints. One systematic way is to look for common 5-letter words that contain O, N, C without the excluded letters.

Some candidates:
- CONCH – contains C, O, N, C, H. But H hasn't been tested yet, and we need to check positions. C is in 1 and 4, O in 2, N in 3. This seems possible.
- CHOCK – C, H, O, C, K. O in 3 is invalid (O can't be in 3 from earlier feedback).
- COCON – C, O, C, O, N. But O is in 3 and 4 which is invalid.
- CONCH seems valid: C in 1, O in 2, N in 3, C in 4, H in 5. All letters are allowed.

Let's verify CONCH:
- C is allowed in 1 and 4 (not excluded).
- O is allowed in 2 (not excluded).
- N is allowed in 3 (not excluded).
- H is a new letter to test.
- No excluded letters are used.

Let's try to find a word that satisfies these constraints. One systematic way is to look for common 5-letter words that contain O, N, C without the excluded letters.

Some candidates:
- CONCH – contains C, O, N, C, H. But H hasn't been tested yet, and we need to check positions. C is in 1 and 4, O in 2, N in 3. This seems possible.
- CHOCK – C, H, O, C, K. O in 3 is invalid (O can't be in 3 from earlier feedback).
- COCON – C, O, C, O, N. But O is in 3 and 4 which is invalid.
- CONCH seems valid: C in 1, O in 2, N in 3, C in 4, H in 5. All letters are allowed.

Let's verify CONCH:
- C is allowed in 1 and 4 (not excluded).
- O is allowed in 2 (not excluded).
- N is allowed in 3 (not excluded).
- H is a new letter to test.
- No excluded letters are used.

This seems like a good next guess.

So far we know:
1. Letters in the word: O, N, C (and possibly others not yet tested).
2. Letters excluded: A, R, S, E, T, I, H.
3. Position constraints:
   - C must be in position 4 (from C(✓)).
   - O must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but 4 is already C), so 1, 3, or 5.
   - N must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 4 is C), so 1, 2, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has C in position 4.
- Contains O and N in allowed positions.
- Uses only letters not excluded.

Possible structure: _ _ _ C _

With O and N needing to be placed in positions 1, 3, 5 for O and 1, 2, 5 for N.

Let's think of words fitting _ _ _ C _ with O and N:
- If O is in position 1: O _ _ C _
  - N must be in 2 or 5.
  - Possible: O N _ C _ or O _ _ C N
  - Need valid words: ONC... (ONC is a prefix but not a word) or O _ _ C N.
  - Example: OUNCO – but U is allowed, N is in 2, C in 4, O in 1. But OUNCO is not a common word.
  - Another: OXCON – X is allowed, but OXCON is not a standard word.

- If O is in position 3: _ _ O C _
  - N must be in 1, 2, or 5.
  - Possible: N _ O C _ or _ N O C _ or _ _ O C N
  - Example: N O O C N – invalid (double O).
  - Another: B O O C N – invalid.
  - Need valid words: Maybe ""BOCON"" – but B is allowed, O in 3, C in 4, N in 5. BOCON is not standard.
  - ""DUNCO"" – D is allowed, U is allowed, N in 2, C in 4, O in 3. DUNCO is a valid word (variant of ""dunno"" or slang).

- If O is in position 5: _ _ _ C O
  - N must be in 1 or 2.
  - Possible: N _ _ C O or _ N _ C O
  - Example: N A C O – but A is excluded.

  - ""F U N C O"" – F, U, N, C, O. FUNCO is not a standard word.
  - ""P U N C O"" – PUNCO is not standard.
  - ""B U N C O"" – BUNCO is a valid word (a game).

DUNCO and BUNCO are both valid, but DUNCO seems more likely. Let's check DUNCO:
- D: allowed (not excluded)
- U: allowed

This fits all constraints.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and common consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _ (O is the third letter).
2. Letters A, R, S, E are excluded.
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels (like I, U, T, N, L, etc.).

A good next word should:
- Keep O in the third position.
- Avoid A, R, S, E.
- Introduce new common letters to test.

Possible candidates:
- TONIC (T, O, N, I, C) – tests T, N, I, C.
- LUNGI (L, U, N, G, I) – tests L, U, N, G, I.
- CLOUD (C, L, O, U, D) – tests C, L, U, D.

- Uses only letters not yet excluded (so no A, R, S, E, T, I).
- Must contain O, N, and C.
- Must place O, N, C in positions they are allowed to be in.

Possible positions:

Let's break down the latest feedback from DUNCO:
- D(x) – D is NOT in the word.
- U(x) – U is NOT in the word.
- N(-) – N is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- C(✓) – C is in the word AND in position 4.
- O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we have:
1. Letters in the word: O, N, C (and possibly others not yet tested).
2. Letters excluded: A, R, S, E, T, I, H, D, U.
3. Position constraints:
   - C is fixed in position 4.
   - O is in positions 1, 2, 3 (cannot be 4 or 5).
   - N is in positions 1, 2, 5 (cannot be 3 or 4).

We need a 5-letter word with:
- C in position 4.
- O and N placed in allowed positions.
- Only letters not yet excluded.

Possible positions:
- O: 1, 2, 3
- N: 1, 2, 5
- C: 4 (fixed)

Let's list valid combinations:
1. O in 1, N in 2 or 5
2. O in 2, N in 1 or 5
3. O in 3, N in 1 or 2

We need to check which of these combinations form valid words.

Option 1: O in 1, N in 2 → O N _ C _
   - Need a valid letter for position 3 (must be from remaining allowed letters: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z)
   - Example: O N B C _ – but we need a valid word. ONBC_ doesn't form a word.
   - O N G C _ – ONGCI? No.
   - O N L C _ – ONLC_ – no valid word.

Option 2: O in 1, N in 5 → O _ _ C N
   - Need valid letters for 2 and 3.
   - Example: O B L C N – not a word.
   - O G L C N – not a word.
   - O M P C N – not a word.

Option 3: O in 2, N in 1 → N O _ C _
   - Need valid letter for 3.
   - Example: N O B C _ – NOBC_ – no word.
   - N O G C _ – NOGC_ – no word.
   - N O M C _ – NOMC_ – no word.

Option 4: O in 2, N in 5 → _ O _ C N
   - Need valid letters for 1 and 3.
   - Example: B O L C N – BOLCN – no word.
   - F O L C N – FOLCN – no word.
   - L O B C N – LOBCN – no word.

Option 5: O in 3, N in 1 → N _ O C _
   - Need valid letter for 2.
   - Example: N B O C _ – NBOCK? No.
   - N F O C _ – NFOCK? No.
   - N L O C _ – NLOCK – not a word.

Option 6: O in 3, N in 2 → _ N O C _
   - Need valid letter for 1.
   - Example: B N O C _ – B N O C _ – B N O C K – B N O C K is not a word.
   - F N O C _ – F N O C K – not a word.
   - L N O C _ – L N O C K – not a word.

Hmm, none of these combinations seem to form valid English words. Let me think differently – perhaps we need to include another letter that hasn't been excluded yet. The remaining allowed letters are: B, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for 5-letter words with C in position 4, containing both O and N, using only allowed letters.

Possible word: ""PONCHO"" – but H is excluded.
""FUNKY"" – no C.
""BLOCK"" – no N.
""JOCKY"" – no O.
""KNOCK"" – has C twice, but K is allowed, but O is not in position 5 (it's in 3), but K is allowed.
Wait, KNOCK:
- K N O C K
- C is in position 4 – correct.
- O is in position 3 – allowed (not excluded positions).
- N is in position 2 – allowed (not excluded positions).
- Letters: K, N, O, C, K – all allowed (not in excluded list).
This seems valid.

Another: ""LONER"" – but E is excluded.
""MONKS"" – S is excluded.
""YONIC"" – I is excluded.
""VOCAL"" – A is excluded.
""BONED"" – D is excluded.
""FONIC"" – I is excluded.

""KNOCK"" appears to be the only valid word fitting all constraints.

Let's verify:
- K: allowed
- N: allowed, position 2 (not excluded)
- O: allowed, position 3 (not excluded)
- C: allowed, position 4 (correct)
- K: allowed

This fits all feedback.
