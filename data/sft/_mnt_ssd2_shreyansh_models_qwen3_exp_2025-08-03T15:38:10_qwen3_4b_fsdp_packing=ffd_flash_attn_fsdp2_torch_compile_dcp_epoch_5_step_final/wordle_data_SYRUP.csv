For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common vowel in English

This combination gives me good coverage of common letters and positions to test against the secret word.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - Word starts with S
   - Letters L, A, T, E are not in the word

2. SWORD → S(✓) W(x) O(x) R(-) D(x)
   - Word starts with S
   - Letters W, O, D are not in the word
   - Letter R is in the word but not in position 4

So far we know:
- First letter is S
- R is somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, W, O, D

Remaining common consonants: N, C, H, M, P, B, G, K, F, V, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U

A good third guess should:
- Start with S
- Include R in position 2, 3, or 5
- Use new letters that haven’t been tested yet

Let’s try “SHRIN” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
How about “SPURN”?  
- Starts with S
- P, U, N haven’t been tested
- R is in position 4 (but we know R isn’t in position 4 from SWORD feedback). So that’s invalid.

Next try: “CRISP” – but C isn’t in position 2 (we know R must be somewhere).  
Try “FRISK” – F, I, S, K new, but S is already fixed at start, and R is in position 3 (valid).  
Let’s check:  
F – new  
R – in word, position 3 (valid)  
I – new  
S – fixed  
K – new  

“FRISK” seems valid and tests new letters F, I, K while keeping R in position 3.

Another option is “SPURN” but R is in position 4 which we know is wrong.  
Another is “SHRUB” – but B is new, H new, R in position 2.  
But “FRISK” seems better as it tests 3 new letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common vowel in English

This combination gives me good coverage of common letters and positions to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the word starts with S and contains none of L, A, T, E.  
I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Begins with S
2. Does NOT contain L, A, T, E
3. Uses remaining common letters to maximize information gain

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, H, M, P, B, G, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out)

A strong second guess could be “SWORD”:
- Starts with S
- Contains W, R, O, D (none of which are L, A, T, E)
- Tests new common letters W, R, O, D

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - Word starts with S
   - Letters L, A, T, E are not in the word

2. SWORD → S(✓) W(x) O(x) R(-) D(x)
   - Word starts with S
   - Letters W, O, D are not in the word
   - Letter R is in the word but not in position 4

So far we know:
- First letter is S
- R is somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, W, O, D

Remaining common consonants: N, C, H, M, P, B, G, K, F, V, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U

A good third guess should:
- Start with S
- Include R in position 2, 3, or 5
- Use new letters that haven’t been tested yet

Let’s try “SHRIN” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
How about “SPURN”?  
- Starts with S
- P, U, N haven’t been tested
- R is in position 4 (but we know R isn’t in position 4 from SWORD feedback). So that’s invalid.

Next try: “CRISP” – but C isn’t in position 2 (we know R must be somewhere).  
Try “FRISK” – F, I, S, K new, but S is already fixed at start, and R is in position 3 (valid).  
Let’s check:  
F – new  
R – in word, position 3 (valid)  
I – new  
S – fixed  
K – new  

“FRISK” seems valid and tests new letters F, I, K while keeping R in position 3.

Another option is “SPURN” but R is in position 4 which we know is wrong.  
Another is “SHRUB” – but B is new, H new, R in position 2.  
But “FRISK” seems better as it tests 3 new letters.

Final choice: “FRISK”

We need a 5-letter word that:

- Contains R (pos 3 or 5)
- Contains P (not pos 2)
- Contains U (not pos 3)
- Uses only allowed letters

Let's try R in position 3:
S _ R _ _

Possible positions for P and U:
- P cannot be in position 2, so it could be 4 or 5
- U cannot be in position 3 (already R), so it could be 2, 4, or 5

Let's try:
- Position 2: U
- Position 4: P
- Position 5: need a letter that is allowed and common, remaining letters: C, H, M, B, G, Y

So the word would be S U R P _ 

Check if ""SURPY"" is a valid word - no
Check ""SURPC"" - no
Check ""SURPH"" - no
Check ""SURPM"" - no
Check ""SURGY"" - no

Try R in position 5:
S _ _ _ R

Now place P and U:
- P cannot be in position 2, so it could be 3 or 4
- U cannot be in position 3, so it could be 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is R), so 2 or 4

Let's try:
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: P
- Position 4: need a letter, remaining: C, H, M, B, G, Y

So the word would be S U P _ R

Possible valid words:
- ""SUPER"" - but E is absent
- ""SUPAR"" - but A is absent
- ""SUPUR"" - not a valid word
- ""SUPHR"" - not valid
- ""SUPMR"" - not valid
- ""SUPGR"" - not valid
- ""SUPYR"" - not valid

Try position 2: U, position 4: P, position 3: need a letter
S U _ P R - but position 3 needs a letter, remaining: C, H, M, B, G, Y

Valid word: ""SUCKR"" - but C is allowed, K is absent
""SUGAR"" - but A is absent
""SUPER"" - E is absent
""SUVER"" - not valid
""SUMPR"" - not valid
""SUBPR"" - not valid
""SUGPR"" - not valid
""SYMPR"" - not valid

Try position 2: C (instead of U)
S C _ _ R

Place P and U:
- P cannot be in position 2 (already C), so 3,4
- U cannot be in position 3, so 2,4,5 (5 is R), so 2 or 4

Try:
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: P

This path seems difficult. Let's try R in position 3 again but with different placement.

This is very restrictive. Let's try a different letter combination.

What if we use ""S"" + ""C"" + ""U"" + ""R"" + ""P"" but rearrange:

""SCRUP"" - but that's S C R U P, which would be:
S(✓) C(new) R(pos 3) U(pos 4) P(pos 5) - but we know P must be in the word (from SPURN feedback), and in SCRUP P is in position 5 which is allowed (P is in word but not in position 2). U is in position 4 which is allowed (not in position 3). R is in position 3 which is allowed (not in 2,4). This seems valid.

Check if ""SCRUP"" is a valid English word - yes, it is (short for scruples).

So the word is ""SCRUP"".

Let's verify constraints:
- Starts with S (✓)
- R is in position 3 (allowed, not 2 or 4)
- P is in position 5 (allowed, not 2)
- U is in position 4 (allowed, not 3)
- No letters from the banned list used (L, A, T, E, W, O, D, F, I, K, N)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common vowel in English

This combination gives me good coverage of common letters and positions to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the word starts with S and contains none of L, A, T, E.  
I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Begins with S
2. Does NOT contain L, A, T, E
3. Uses remaining common letters to maximize information gain

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, H, M, P, B, G, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are out)

A strong second guess could be “SWORD”:
- Starts with S
- Contains W, R, O, D (none of which are L, A, T, E)
- Tests new common letters W, R, O, D

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SWORD -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) W(x) O(x) R(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - Word starts with S
   - Letters L, A, T, E are not in the word

2. SWORD → S(✓) W(x) O(x) R(-) D(x)
   - Word starts with S
   - Letters W, O, D are not in the word
   - Letter R is in the word but not in position 4

So far we know:
- First letter is S
- R is somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, W, O, D

Remaining common consonants: N, C, H, M, P, B, G, K, F, V, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U

A good third guess should:
- Start with S
- Include R in position 2, 3, or 5
- Use new letters that haven’t been tested yet

Let’s try “SHRIN” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
How about “SPURN”?  
- Starts with S
- P, U, N haven’t been tested
- R is in position 4 (but we know R isn’t in position 4 from SWORD feedback). So that’s invalid.

Next try: “CRISP” – but C isn’t in position 2 (we know R must be somewhere).  
Try “FRISK” – F, I, S, K new, but S is already fixed at start, and R is in position 3 (valid).  
Let’s check:  
F – new  
R – in word, position 3 (valid)  
I – new  
S – fixed  
K – new  

“FRISK” seems valid and tests new letters F, I, K while keeping R in position 3.

Another option is “SPURN” but R is in position 4 which we know is wrong.  
Another is “SHRUB” – but B is new, H new, R in position 2.  
But “FRISK” seems better as it tests 3 new letters.

Final choice: “FRISK”

From all feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
   - S is fixed in position 1  
   - Letters L, A, T, E are absent

2. SWORD → S(✓) W(x) O(x) R(-) D(x)  
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 4

3. FRISK → F(x) R(-) I(x) S(-) K(x)  
   - F, I, K are absent  
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2  
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4 (but we already know S is fixed in position 1, so this is redundant)

Current constraints:
- Word starts with S (position 1)
- R must be in position 3 or 5 (cannot be 2 or 4)
- Letters already ruled out: L, A, T, E, W, O, D, F, I, K
- Remaining unused common letters: N, C, H, M, P, B, G, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Has R in position 3 or 5
- Uses only allowed letters

Let’s try R in position 3:  
S _ R _ _

Possible middle letters from remaining: N, C, H, M, P, B, G, U, Y  
Try “SUNRY” – invalid  
“SCORN” – C, O, R, N: O is ruled out  
“SURGE” – E is ruled out  
“SHORN” – H, O, R, N: O is ruled out  
“SPURN” – P, U, R, N: all allowed, R in position 3  
Check if “SPURN” is valid – yes, it is.

Let’s verify:
S(✓) P(new) U(new) R(pos 3) N(new) – no ruled-out letters used, and R is in allowed position.

Therefore, “SPURN” is a good next guess.

This path seems difficult. Let's try R in position 3 again but with different placement.

Alternative approach: Maybe P is in position 5 and U is in position 2 or 4.

Try:
S U R _ P - but P in position 5, R in position 3

""S Y _ U R"" - ""SYUR"" - no

This is tricky. Let's try P in position 3 and R in position 5.

Word form: S _ P _ R
Possible positions for U:
- U cannot be in position 3 (P), cannot be in position 3 (R), so position 2 or 4

Try U in position 2:
S U P _ R

""S Y U P R"" - ""SYUPR"" - no

This is very restrictive. Let's try a different letter combination.

What if we use ""S"" + ""C"" + ""U"" + ""R"" + ""P"" but rearrange:

""SCRUP"" - but that's S C R U P, which would be:
S(✓) C(new) R(pos 3) U(pos 4) P(pos 5) - but we know P must be in the word (from SPURN feedback), and in SCRUP P is in position 5 which is allowed (P is in word but not in position 2). U is in position 4 which is allowed (not in position 3). R is in position 3 which is allowed (not in 2,4). This seems valid.

Check if ""SCRUP"" is a valid English word - yes, it is (short for scruples).

So the word is ""SCRUP"".

Let's verify constraints:
- Starts with S (✓)
- R is in position 3 (allowed, not 2 or 4)
- P is in position 5 (allowed, not 2)
- U is in position 4 (allowed, not 3)
- No letters from the banned list used (L, A, T, E, W, O, D, F, I, K, N)
- Uses only allowed letters: S, C, R, U, P
