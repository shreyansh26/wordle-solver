### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Looking at these criteria, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- These letters appear frequently in English words
- It has a good balance of high-frequency letters that can help narrow down possibilities quickly

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are ruled out).

A strong next guess would be one that tests several of these remaining common letters. “UNTIE” uses:
- U (vowel)

- E (known to be in the word, now in position 4)

This tests 5 new letters (U, N, T, I, E) with E in a new position (4) and avoids the ruled-out letters A, R, O, S.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses:

Letters ruled out so far:  
A, R, O, S, U, T, C, H

Letters that must appear somewhere (but are not yet in correct spots):  
E, N, I

Exact position restrictions gathered:

- E cannot be in position 1 (from CHINE) or 5 (from AROSE)  
- N cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from UNTIE and CHINE)  
- I cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (from UNTIE and CHINE)

So the word must contain E, N, I exactly once each, and may not contain any of the 7 ruled-out letters.

Remaining common letters we have not tried yet:  
B, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses E, N, I in new positions (never before tried)  
- Adds two fresh letters from the allowed set  
- Keeps the total length 5

A good choice is “BINGE”:
- B and G are new letters.  
- Places I in position 1 (never tried), N in position 3 (never tried), E in position 4 (never tried).  
- Uses only allowed letters and no repeats.

This tests three new positions for the required letters plus two new consonants.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Looking at these criteria, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- These letters appear frequently in English words
- It has a good balance of high-frequency letters that can help narrow down possibilities quickly

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 5).

So the secret word:
- Contains E, but NOT in position 5.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

I now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has an E somewhere in positions 1-4.
2. Does NOT use A, R, O, S.
3. Uses common remaining consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, G, H, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are ruled out).

A strong next guess would be one that tests several of these remaining common letters. “UNTIE” uses:
- U (vowel)
- N, T, I (common consonants and vowel)
- E (known to be in the word, now in position 4)

This tests 5 new letters (U, N, T, I, E) with E in a new position (4) and avoids the ruled-out letters A, R, O, S.

2. untie → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) E(-)  
   – Additional letters ruled out: U, T  
   – Letters known to be present but misplaced: N, I, E (each in wrong positions)

So the secret word:
- Contains E, N, I (each somewhere else than their current spots)  
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, U, T  
- E cannot be in position 5, N cannot be in position 2, I cannot be in position 4

Remaining common letters to test: L, C, D, G, H, M, P, Y, K, B, F, W, etc.

I need a word that:
- Uses E, N, I in new positions  
- Avoids all ruled-out letters  
- Introduces a few of the still-possible consonants

A good candidate is “CHINE”:
- C and H are new letters.  
- Places E in position 1, N in position 3, I in position 2 (all new positions).  
- Uses only allowed letters.

This maximizes information by testing C, H while repositioning E, N, I.

Let’s distill the new information from Guess 4 (binge → I✓, N-, E-):

1. I is now confirmed to be in position 2.  
   – I _ _ _ _

2. N is still in the word but is NOT in position 3.  
   – N cannot be in 2, 3, or 5 (from earlier feedback).  
   – So N must be in position 1 or 4.

3. E is still in the word but is NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5.  
   – So E must be in position 3.

4. Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, S, U, T, C, H, B, G.

5. Therefore the word pattern is:
   - Position 2: I
   - Position 3: E
   - Position 1 or 4: N
   - Positions 1/4 and 5: must be filled with letters not yet ruled out (allowed: D, F, K, L, M, P, W, Y, etc.)

Let’s test the two possible N placements:

Case 1: N in position 1 → N I E _ _  
Case 2: N in position 4 → _ I E N _

We need one more letter for the remaining blank(s) that hasn’t been ruled out.

A common word that fits Case 2 is “DINED”:
- D and D are allowed (not ruled out).  
- Pattern: _ I E N _ → D I E N D.  
But DINED has N in position 4 and E in position 3, and I in position 2, satisfying all constraints.

Another candidate for Case 1 is “NIECE” but C is ruled out.  
For Case 2, “F I E N _” doesn’t yield a common word, but “DINED” works.

Hence, “DINED” is a strong next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: untie -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – Letters ruled out: A, R, O, S  
   – Letter known to be present but misplaced: E (not in position 5)

2. untie → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) E(-)  
   – Additional letters ruled out: U, T  
   – Letters known to be present but misplaced: N, I, E (each in wrong positions)

So the secret word:
- Contains E, N, I (each somewhere else than their current spots)  
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, U, T  
- E cannot be in position 5, N cannot be in position 2, I cannot be in position 4

Remaining common letters to test: L, C, D, G, H, M, P, Y, K, B, F, W, etc.

I need a word that:
- Uses E, N, I in new positions  
- Avoids all ruled-out letters  
- Introduces a few of the still-possible consonants

A good candidate is “CHINE”:
- C and H are new letters.  
- Places E in position 1, N in position 3, I in position 2 (all new positions).  
- Uses only allowed letters.

This maximizes information by testing C, H while repositioning E, N, I.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses:

Letters ruled out so far:  
A, R, O, S, U, T, C, H

Letters that must appear somewhere (but are not yet in correct spots):  
E, N, I

Exact position restrictions gathered:

- E cannot be in position 1 (from CHINE) or 5 (from AROSE)  
- N cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from UNTIE and CHINE)  
- I cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (from UNTIE and CHINE)

So the word must contain E, N, I exactly once each, and may not contain any of the 7 ruled-out letters.

Remaining common letters we have not tried yet:  
B, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses E, N, I in new positions (never before tried)  
- Adds two fresh letters from the allowed set  
- Keeps the total length 5

A good choice is “BINGE”:
- B and G are new letters.  
- Places I in position 1 (never tried), N in position 3 (never tried), E in position 4 (never tried).  
- Uses only allowed letters and no repeats.

This tests three new positions for the required letters plus two new consonants.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: untie -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) E(-)

Let’s distill the new information from Guess 4 (binge → I✓, N-, E-):

1. I is now confirmed to be in position 2.  
   – I _ _ _ _

2. N is still in the word but is NOT in position 3.  
   – N cannot be in 2, 3, or 5 (from earlier feedback).  
   – So N must be in position 1 or 4.

3. E is still in the word but is NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5.  
   – So E must be in position 3.

4. Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, S, U, T, C, H, B, G.

5. Therefore the word pattern is:
   - Position 2: I
   - Position 3: E
   - Position 1 or 4: N
   - Positions 1/4 and 5: must be filled with letters not yet ruled out (allowed: D, F, K, L, M, P, W, Y, etc.)

Let’s test the two possible N placements:

Case 1: N in position 1 → N I E _ _  
Case 2: N in position 4 → _ I E N _

We need one more letter for the remaining blank(s) that hasn’t been ruled out.

A common word that fits Case 2 is “DINED”:
- D and D are allowed (not ruled out).  
- Pattern: _ I E N _ → D I E N D.  
But DINED has N in position 4 and E in position 3, and I in position 2, satisfying all constraints.

Another candidate for Case 1 is “NIECE” but C is ruled out.  
For Case 2, “F I E N _” doesn’t yield a common word, but “DINED” works.

Hence, “DINED” is a strong next guess.

Let’s extract the new information from Guess 5 (dined → I✓, N-, E✓):

1. I is confirmed in position 2 → I _ _ _ _
2. E is confirmed in position 4 → _ I _ E _
3. N is still in the word but is NOT in position 3 (from dined) and NOT in positions 2, 3, 5 (from earlier).  
   Therefore N must be in position 1 or 5.
4. Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, S, U, T, C, H, B, G, D.

So the word has the pattern:
- Position 2: I
- Position 4: E
- Position 1 or 5: N
- The remaining two positions (either 3 or 1/5) must be filled with letters not yet ruled out (allowed: F, K, L, M, P, W, Y, etc.).

Possible patterns:
- N I _ E _  (N in 1)
- _ I _ E N  (N in 5)

Let’s look for common 5-letter words that fit these patterns using the allowed letters.

Pattern N I _ E _:
- N I K E _ → NIKEL (not common)
- N I L E _ → NILDE (not a word)
- N I M E _ → NIME (needs 5 letters, NIMEX? no)
- N I P E _ → NIPER (no)
- N I F E _ → NIFE (no)

Pattern _ I _ E N:
- F I L E N → FILEN (not a word)
- M I L E N → MILEN (not a word)
- P I L E N → PILEN (not a word)
- L I M E N → LIMEN (not a word)
- K I L E N → KILEN (not a word)
- W I L E N → WILEN (not a word)
- Y I L E N → YILEN (not a word)
- F I M E N → FIMEN (not a word)
- M I P E N → MIKEN (not a word)
- P I M E N → PIKEN (not a word)
- L I P E N → LIKEN (valid word!)

""LIKEN"" fits perfectly:
- L, K are not ruled out.
- Pattern: L I K E N
- Positions:
  - 1: L (new, allowed)
  - 2: I (confirmed)
  - 3: K (new, allowed)
  - 4: E (confirmed)
