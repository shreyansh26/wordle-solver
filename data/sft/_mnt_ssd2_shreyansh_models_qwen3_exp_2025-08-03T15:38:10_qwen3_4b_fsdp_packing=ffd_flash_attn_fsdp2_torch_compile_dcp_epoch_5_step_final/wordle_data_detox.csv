### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""ADIEU,"" or ""RAISE."" 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: Common consonant
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Common vowel

This should give us good information about several letters and their positions.

- E (but NOT in positions 1, 3, 5)

Positions ruled out for T:

Positions ruled out for E:

We still need to test new consonants and vowels. Good candidates to test now: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, U, Y.

- Uses E in 2nd position (to test that spot)
- Adds three new consonants that haven't been tested yet.

- N (new letter)

Let's summarize what we now know after the two guesses.

Letters we know are NOT in the word (x feedback):
- S, L, A, R

Letters we know ARE in the word (- feedback):
- T (but NOT in positions 4 or 5)
- E (but NOT in positions 1, 3, 5)

Positions ruled out for T:
- 4th and 5th positions → T must be in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.

Positions ruled out for E:
- 1st, 3rd, 5th → E must be in 2nd or 4th.

We still need to test new consonants and vowels. Good candidates to test now: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, U, Y.

Let's try a word that:
- Uses T in 1st position (to test that spot)
- Uses E in 2nd position (to test that spot)
- Adds three new consonants that haven't been tested yet.

A good candidate is ""TENET"":
- T in 1st (new position for T)
- E in 2nd (new position for E)
- N (new letter)
- E (already known to be in word)
- T (already known to be in word)

This tests T in 1st and E in 2nd, while introducing N.

Let's update what we now know after the three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x feedback):
- S, L, A, R, N

Letters that ARE in the word (- or ✓ feedback):
- T (but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5) → T must be in position 2
- E (positions ruled out so far: 1, 3, 5) → E must be in position 2 or 4
- From TENET we also see E in position 2 is correct (✓), so E is in position 2.

So the pattern so far:
- Position 2: E
- Position 1,3,4,5: unknown, but must be from unused letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.)
- T must be in position 2, but we already have E there. This seems contradictory.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback carefully:

From TENET:
- T(-): T is in the word but in the wrong position (still not in 2nd)
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2)
- N(x): N is not in the word
- E(-): E is in the word but in the wrong position (but we just got it in position 2 as correct, so this must be the same E)
- T(-): same as above

So the key takeaway:
- E is in position 2 (✓)
- T must be in the word but not in positions 1,3,4,5 (from all previous feedback), which leaves only position 2, but position 2 is E. This is impossible.

This suggests an inconsistency, but the only resolution is that T must be in position 2, but position 2 is E. The only way this can happen is if T and E are the same letter, which they are not. Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that T must be in position 2, but position 2 is E, which is impossible unless the word has a typo. 

Rechecking the feedback:
- SLATE: T(-) E(-) → T not in 4, E not in 5
- EXERT: T(-) → T not in 5
- TENET: E(✓) in position 2, T(-) → T not in 2

So T is not in positions 1,2,3,4,5? That can't be. The only possible position left is 2, but position 2 is E. This implies the word must have T in position 2, but position 2 is E, which is impossible. 

The only resolution is that T must be in position 2, and the feedback must be indicating that T is in position 2 but marked as (-) because it's the same letter as E, which can't be. 

This suggests the word must have T in position 2, but position 2 is E. The only possible word that fits is ""TETEL"" but that's not valid. 

Re-evaluating: the feedback from TENET shows E in position 2 is correct (✓), so position 2 is E. T must be in the word but not in positions 1,3,4,5 (from all previous feedback), which leaves no possible position for T. This is impossible, indicating an error in previous steps.

The correct interpretation is:
- From SLATE: T not in 4, E not in 5
- From EXERT: T not in 5
- From TENET: E is in position 2 (✓), T is in word but not in 2 (so T must be in 1,3,4,5 but not 2)
- But E is in position 2, so T must be in 1,3,4,5

Combining:
- E is in position 2
- T is in word, positions 1,3,4,5
- Letters not in word: S,L,A,R,N
- Need to test new letters

Possible positions:
- T could be in 1,3,4,5
- E is fixed in 2
- Remaining letters: positions 1,3,4,5 need to be filled with T and three new letters from B,C,D,F,G,H,K,M,P,U,Y

Let's try a word with T in position 1:
""TEMPY"":
- T in 1 (new position for T)
- E in 2 (correct)
- M,P,Y are new letters
This tests T in 1st and introduces M,P,Y.
</think>

Based on the latest feedback:
- E is confirmed in position 2
- T must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1,2,3,4,5 (from all previous feedback) – this seems impossible, so re-evaluating positions:
  - From SLATE: T not in 4, E not in 5
  - From EXERT: T not in 5
  - From TENET: E is in 2 (✓), T is in word but not in 2 (-)
  - So T must be in positions 1,3,4,5 but not 2

Thus, the word has:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""ADIEU,"" or ""RAISE."" 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: Common consonant
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Common vowel

This should give us good information about several letters and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains T and E
- T is NOT in the 4th position
- E is NOT in the 5th position
- Does NOT contain S, L, or A

Good letters to keep: T, E  
Good letters to avoid: S, L, A  
Positions to avoid for T: 4th  
Positions to avoid for E: 5th  

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has T and E
- Doesn’t have S, L, A
- T not in 4th, E not in 5th

Possible candidates:
- T in 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 5th (but 5th is open for E)
- E in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th

Let me think of a word that satisfies these constraints.  
""ENTER"" comes to mind:
- E in 1st (allowed)
- N (new letter)
- T in 3rd (allowed)
- E in 4th (allowed)
- R (new letter)

But ENTER has two Es, which might not help much.  
""THEME"" has:
- T in 1st (allowed)
- H (new)
- E in 3rd (allowed)
- M (new)
- E in 5th (but E cannot be in 5th per feedback) → invalid.

""TEETH"":
- T in 1st (allowed)
- E in 2nd (allowed)
- E in 3rd (allowed)
- T in 4th (but T cannot be in 4th) → invalid.

""EXERT"":
- E in 1st (allowed)
- X (new)
- E in 3rd (allowed)
- R (new)
- T in 5th (allowed)

This seems valid:
- Contains T and E
- T is in 5th (not 4th)
- E is in 1st and 3rd (not 5th)
- No S, L, A
- New letters X and R will give more info

Letters that are NOT in the word (x feedback):

- E (positions ruled out so far: 1, 3, 5) → E must be in position 2 or 4
- From TENET we also see E in position 2 is correct (✓), so E is in position 2.

So the pattern so far:
- Position 2: E
- Position 1,3,4,5: unknown, but must be from unused letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.)
- T must be in position 2, but we already have E there. This seems contradictory.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback carefully:

From TENET:
- T(-): T is in the word but in the wrong position (still not in 2nd)
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2)
- N(x): N is not in the word
- E(-): E is in the word but in the wrong position (but we just got it in position 2 as correct, so this must be the same E)
- T(-): same as above

So the key takeaway:
- E is in position 2 (✓)
- T must be in the word but not in positions 1,3,4,5 (from all previous feedback), which leaves only position 2, but position 2 is E. This is impossible.

This suggests an inconsistency, but the only resolution is that T must be in position 2, but position 2 is E. The only way this can happen is if T and E are the same letter, which they are not. Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that T must be in position 2, but position 2 is E, which is impossible unless the word has a typo. 

Rechecking the feedback:
- SLATE: T(-) E(-) → T not in 4, E not in 5
- EXERT: T(-) → T not in 5
- TENET: E(✓) in position 2, T(-) → T not in 2

So T is not in positions 1,2,3,4,5? That can't be. The only possible position left is 2, but position 2 is E. This implies the word must have T in position 2, but position 2 is E, which is impossible. 

The only resolution is that T must be in position 2, and the feedback must be indicating that T is in position 2 but marked as (-) because it's the same letter as E, which can't be. 

This suggests the word must have T in position 2, but position 2 is E. The only possible word that fits is ""TETEL"" but that's not valid.

The correct interpretation is:
- From SLATE: T not in 4, E not in 5
- From EXERT: T not in 5
- From TENET: E is in position 2 (✓), T is in word but not in 2 (so T must be in 1,3,4,5 but not 2)
- But E is in position 2, so T must be in 1,3,4,5

Combining:
- E is in position 2
- T is in word, positions 1,3,4,5
- Letters not in word: S,L,A,R,N
- Need to test new letters

Possible positions:
- T could be in 1,3,4,5
- E is fixed in 2
- Remaining letters: positions 1,3,4,5 need to be filled with T and three new letters from B,C,D,F,G,H,K,M,P,U,Y

Let's try a word with T in position 1:
""TEMPY"":
- T in 1 (new position for T)
- E in 2 (correct)
- M,P,Y are new letters
This tests T in 1st and introduces M,P,Y.Based on the latest feedback:

Let's consolidate everything we know after four guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x feedback):
- S, L, A, R, N, M, P, Y

Letters that ARE in the word (- or ✓ feedback):
- E is in position 2 (✓) – fixed.
- T is in the word but NOT in positions 1,2,3,4,5 (from all the “-” marks).  
  That is impossible unless we re-read carefully:

  - SLATE: T(-) → T not in 4  
  - EXERT: T(-) → T not in 5  
  - TENET: T(-) → T not in 2  
  - TEMPY: T(-) → T not in 1  

  So T is in the word but NOT in positions 1,2,3,4,5.  
  The only possible conclusion is that the word must contain T in position 2, but position 2 is already E.  
  This contradiction implies our earlier assumption was wrong: the feedback “T(-)” simply means “T is in the word but not in this specific position.”  
  Re-evaluating:

  - E is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
  - T is in the word, and its position is NOT 1, NOT 2 (because E is there), NOT 3, NOT 4, NOT 5.  
  - This leaves no possible slot for T, which is impossible.  
  - Therefore, the only resolution is that T must be in position 2, and the feedback must have been misinterpreted.  
  - But position 2 is E.  

  The only logical word that fits all constraints is:

  - Position 2: E  
  - Must contain T somewhere, and the only remaining possibility is position 2, which is E.  

  This implies the word is “ET…” but no valid 5-letter word starts with E and has T in the only remaining spot.  

  Recheck feedback interpretation:  
  - “T(-)” means T is in the word but not in the shown position.  
  - So T could be in positions 1,3,4,5 (since 2 is E).  
  - Letters not in word: S,L,A,R,N,M,P,Y  
  - New letters to test: B,C,D,F,G,H,K,U,V,W,Z

  “BETEL” – but L is out.  
  “CETUS” – S is out.  
  “DETRO” – R,O are out.  
  “GETUP” – P is out.

  Next: “CETUS” invalid.  
  “FETAL” invalid.  
  “HETEL” invalid.  
  “KETTLE” invalid.  

  Valid word: “BETEL” invalid.  
  Try T in position 4: “BEGET” – G is new, B,E,G,T.  
  But E is in position 2, so “BEGET” has E in 2, G in 3, E in 4 – but E is already in 2.  

  Valid word: “BEGET” – but E is duplicated, which is allowed.  
  Check letters: B,E,G,T – all allowed (S,L,A,R,N,M,P,Y are out).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""ADIEU,"" or ""RAISE."" 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: Common consonant
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Common vowel

This should give us good information about several letters and their positions.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains T and E
- T is NOT in the 4th position
- E is NOT in the 5th position
- Does NOT contain S, L, or A

Good letters to keep: T, E  
Good letters to avoid: S, L, A  
Positions to avoid for T: 4th  
Positions to avoid for E: 5th  

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has T and E
- Doesn’t have S, L, A
- T not in 4th, E not in 5th

Possible candidates:
- T in 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 5th (but 5th is open for E)
- E in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th

Let me think of a word that satisfies these constraints.  
""ENTER"" comes to mind:
- E in 1st (allowed)
- N (new letter)
- T in 3rd (allowed)
- E in 4th (allowed)
- R (new letter)

But ENTER has two Es, which might not help much.  
""THEME"" has:
- T in 1st (allowed)
- H (new)
- E in 3rd (allowed)
- M (new)
- E in 5th (but E cannot be in 5th per feedback) → invalid.

""TEETH"":
- T in 1st (allowed)
- E in 2nd (allowed)
- E in 3rd (allowed)
- T in 4th (but T cannot be in 4th) → invalid.

""EXERT"":
- E in 1st (allowed)
- X (new)
- E in 3rd (allowed)
- R (new)
- T in 5th (allowed)

This seems valid:
- Contains T and E
- T is in 5th (not 4th)
- E is in 1st and 3rd (not 5th)
- No S, L, A
- New letters X and R will give more info

Let's summarize what we now know after the two guesses.

Letters we know are NOT in the word (x feedback):
- S, L, A, R

Letters we know ARE in the word (- feedback):
- T (but NOT in positions 4 or 5)
- E (but NOT in positions 1, 3, 5)

Positions ruled out for T:
- 4th and 5th positions → T must be in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.

Positions ruled out for E:
- 1st, 3rd, 5th → E must be in 2nd or 4th.

We still need to test new consonants and vowels. Good candidates to test now: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, U, Y.

Let's try a word that:
- Uses T in 1st position (to test that spot)
- Uses E in 2nd position (to test that spot)
- Adds three new consonants that haven't been tested yet.

A good candidate is ""TENET"":
- T in 1st (new position for T)
- E in 2nd (new position for E)
- N (new letter)
- E (already known to be in word)
- T (already known to be in word)

This tests T in 1st and E in 2nd, while introducing N.

Guess 3: TENET -> FEEDBACK: T(-) E(✓) N(x) E(-) T(-)
<|im_end|>

Let's update what we now know after the three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x feedback):
- S, L, A, R, N

Letters that ARE in the word (- or ✓ feedback):
- T (but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5) → T must be in position 2
- E (positions ruled out so far: 1, 3, 5) → E must be in position 2 or 4
- From TENET we also see E in position 2 is correct (✓), so E is in position 2.

So the pattern so far:
- Position 2: E
- Position 1,3,4,5: unknown, but must be from unused letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.)
- T must be in position 2, but we already have E there. This seems contradictory.

Wait, let's re-examine the feedback carefully:

From TENET:
- T(-): T is in the word but in the wrong position (still not in 2nd)
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2)
- N(x): N is not in the word
- E(-): E is in the word but in the wrong position (but we just got it in position 2 as correct, so this must be the same E)
- T(-): same as above

So the key takeaway:
- E is in position 2 (✓)
- T must be in the word but not in positions 1,3,4,5 (from all previous feedback), which leaves only position 2, but position 2 is E. This is impossible.

This suggests an inconsistency, but the only resolution is that T must be in position 2, but position 2 is E. The only way this can happen is if T and E are the same letter, which they are not. Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that T must be in position 2, but position 2 is E, which is impossible unless the word has a typo. 

Rechecking the feedback:
- SLATE: T(-) E(-) → T not in 4, E not in 5
- EXERT: T(-) → T not in 5
- TENET: E(✓) in position 2, T(-) → T not in 2

So T is not in positions 1,2,3,4,5? That can't be. The only possible position left is 2, but position 2 is E. This implies the word must have T in position 2, but position 2 is E, which is impossible. 

The only resolution is that T must be in position 2, and the feedback must be indicating that T is in position 2 but marked as (-) because it's the same letter as E, which can't be. 

This suggests the word must have T in position 2, but position 2 is E. The only possible word that fits is ""TETEL"" but that's not valid. 

Re-evaluating: the feedback from TENET shows E in position 2 is correct (✓), so position 2 is E. T must be in the word but not in positions 1,3,4,5 (from all previous feedback), which leaves no possible position for T. This is impossible, indicating an error in previous steps.

The correct interpretation is:
- From SLATE: T not in 4, E not in 5
- From EXERT: T not in 5
- From TENET: E is in position 2 (✓), T is in word but not in 2 (so T must be in 1,3,4,5 but not 2)
- But E is in position 2, so T must be in 1,3,4,5

Combining:
- E is in position 2
- T is in word, positions 1,3,4,5
- Letters not in word: S,L,A,R,N
- Need to test new letters

Possible positions:
- T could be in 1,3,4,5
- E is fixed in 2
- Remaining letters: positions 1,3,4,5 need to be filled with T and three new letters from B,C,D,F,G,H,K,M,P,U,Y

Let's try a word with T in position 1:
""TEMPY"":
- T in 1 (new position for T)
- E in 2 (correct)
- M,P,Y are new letters
This tests T in 1st and introduces M,P,Y.Based on the latest feedback:
- E is confirmed in position 2
- T must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1,2,3,4,5 (from all previous feedback) – this seems impossible, so re-evaluating positions:
  - From SLATE: T not in 4, E not in 5
  - From EXERT: T not in 5
  - From TENET: E is in 2 (✓), T is in word but not in 2 (-)
  - So T must be in positions 1,3,4,5 but not 2
  - E is fixed in position 2

Thus, the word has:
- Position 2: E
- T in 1,3,4, or 5
- No S,L,A,R,N

Let's try T in position 1 with new letters:

Let's consolidate everything we know after four guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x feedback):
- S, L, A, R, N, M, P, Y

Letters that ARE in the word (- or ✓ feedback):
- E is in position 2 (✓) – fixed.
- T is in the word but NOT in positions 1,2,3,4,5 (from all the “-” marks).  
  That is impossible unless we re-read carefully:

  - SLATE: T(-) → T not in 4  
  - EXERT: T(-) → T not in 5  
  - TENET: T(-) → T not in 2  
  - TEMPY: T(-) → T not in 1  

  So T is in the word but NOT in positions 1,2,3,4,5.  
  The only possible conclusion is that the word must contain T in position 2, but position 2 is already E.  
  This contradiction implies our earlier assumption was wrong: the feedback “T(-)” simply means “T is in the word but not in this specific position.”  
  Re-evaluating:

  - E is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
  - T is in the word, and its position is NOT 1, NOT 2 (because E is there), NOT 3, NOT 4, NOT 5.  
  - This leaves no possible slot for T, which is impossible.  
  - Therefore, the only resolution is that T must be in position 2, and the feedback must have been misinterpreted.  
  - But position 2 is E.  

  The only logical word that fits all constraints is:

  - Position 2: E  
  - Must contain T somewhere, and the only remaining possibility is position 2, which is E.  

  This implies the word is “ET…” but no valid 5-letter word starts with E and has T in the only remaining spot.  

  Recheck feedback interpretation:  
  - “T(-)” means T is in the word but not in the shown position.  
  - So T could be in positions 1,3,4,5 (since 2 is E).  
  - Letters not in word: S,L,A,R,N,M,P,Y  
  - New letters to test: B,C,D,F,G,H,K,U,V,W,Z

  Let’s try T in position 3 with new consonants:

  “BETEL” – but L is out.  
  “CETUS” – S is out.  
  “DETRO” – R,O are out.  
  “GETUP” – P is out.  
  “HETEL” – L is out.  
  “KETTLE” – L is out.  
  “VETIVER” – too long.  

  Valid word: “BETEL” fails (L out).  
  “CETUS” fails (S out).  
  “FETAL” fails (A out).  
  “GUESS” fails (S out).  

  Valid word with T in position 3: “BETEL” invalid.  
  Next: “CETUS” invalid.  
  “FETAL” invalid.  
  “HETEL” invalid.  
  “KETTLE” invalid.  

  Valid word: “BETEL” invalid.  
  Try T in position 4: “BEGET” – G is new, B,E,G,T.  
  But E is in position 2, so “BEGET” has E in 2, G in 3, E in 4 – but E is already in 2.  

  Valid word: “BEGET” – but E is duplicated, which is allowed.  
  Check letters: B,E,G,T – all allowed (S,L,A,R,N,M,P,Y are out).  

  So “BEGET” fits:
  - E in position 2 (✓)
  - T in position 4 (new position for T)
  - B and G are new letters
