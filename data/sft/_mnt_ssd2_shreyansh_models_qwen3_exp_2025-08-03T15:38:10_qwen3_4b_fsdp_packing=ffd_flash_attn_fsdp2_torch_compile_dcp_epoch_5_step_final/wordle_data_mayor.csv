For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", etc.

Looking at these options:
- AROSE has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
- SLATE has 2 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (S, L, T)
- CRANE has 2 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (C, R, N)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words. This should give us good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-)  – A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all

So we know:
- Letters present somewhere: A, R, O
- Letters not present: S, E
- Positions 1, 2, 3 for A, R, O are all wrong.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, R, O
- Does NOT contain S or E
- Places A, R, O in positions other than 1, 2, 3 respectively.

A good candidate is “RAINY”:
- R in position 1 (was position 2 before, so new position is fine)
- A in position 2 (was position 1 before, so new position is fine)
- O is not used here, but we can still test new letters
Wait, we need to include A, R, O. Let’s pick “ROAST” but it contains S (invalid).  
Next candidate: “CAROT” – but it’s not a valid English word.  
“CRAVO” – not a valid word.  
“CROAK” – contains K, but let’s check: C, R, O, A, K.  
- C: new letter  
- R in position 2 (was position 2 before, so this is invalid because feedback said R is not in position 2).  

Let’s try “CORAL”:
- C, O, R, A, L  
- O in position 2 (was position 3 before, so new position is fine)  
- R in position 3 (was position 2 before, so new position is fine)  
- A in position 4 (was position 1 before, so new position is fine)  
- L: new letter  
This seems valid.

Another candidate is “CORGI” but it’s less common.  
“CROAK” was invalid because R would be in position 2 again.  
“CRAVE” – contains E (invalid).  
“CRANE” – contains E (invalid).  
“GRAFT” – contains T, but let’s see: G, R, A, F, T.  
- R in position 2 (invalid, same as before).

Letters that are in the word (but not yet in the right positions):

- R (not in positions 2, 3)
- O (not in positions 2, 3)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- S, E, C, L

So the secret word must contain A, R, O, and two new letters (from the remaining alphabet).  
The remaining unused common consonants are D, G, H, M, N, P, T, etc., and the only vowel left is I or U.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A, R, O exactly once each.
2. Uses two new letters from the allowed set.
3. Places A, R, O in positions they have not been tried in yet:
   - A can now be in positions 3 or 5 (was in 1,2,4)
   - R can now be in positions 1, 4, 5 (was in 2,3)
   - O can now be in positions 1, 4, 5 (was in 2,3)

A good candidate is “GROAN”:
- G and N are new letters.
- R in position 2 was already tried (and failed) in Guess 1, so that’s invalid.

Next candidate: “ROUND”:
- R in position 1 (new position for R)
- O in position 2 (tried in Guess 2, position 2 – invalid)

Next: “MORPH” – contains H and P, but R is in position 2 again (invalid).

Next: “GRAIN” – G and N, A in position 3 (valid), R in position 2 (invalid).

Next: “TROOP” – repeats O, invalid.

Next: “RATIO” – contains I and T, A in position 3 (valid), R in position 1 (valid), O in position 5 (valid).  
This satisfies all constraints:
- Uses A, R, O in new positions.
- Adds two new letters T and I.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", etc.

Looking at these options:
- AROSE has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
- SLATE has 2 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (S, L, T)
- CRANE has 2 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (C, R, N)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words. This should give us good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-)  – A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all

So we know:
- Letters present somewhere: A, R, O
- Letters not present: S, E
- Positions 1, 2, 3 for A, R, O are all wrong.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, R, O
- Does NOT contain S or E
- Places A, R, O in positions other than 1, 2, 3 respectively.

A good candidate is “RAINY”:
- R in position 1 (was position 2 before, so new position is fine)
- A in position 2 (was position 1 before, so new position is fine)
- O is not used here, but we can still test new letters
Wait, we need to include A, R, O. Let’s pick “ROAST” but it contains S (invalid).  
Next candidate: “CAROT” – but it’s not a valid English word.  
“CRAVO” – not a valid word.  
“CROAK” – contains K, but let’s check: C, R, O, A, K.  
- C: new letter  
- R in position 2 (was position 2 before, so this is invalid because feedback said R is not in position 2).  

Let’s try “CORAL”:
- C, O, R, A, L  
- O in position 2 (was position 3 before, so new position is fine)  
- R in position 3 (was position 2 before, so new position is fine)  
- A in position 4 (was position 1 before, so new position is fine)  
- L: new letter  
This seems valid.

Another candidate is “CORGI” but it’s less common.  
“CROAK” was invalid because R would be in position 2 again.  
“CRAVE” – contains E (invalid).  
“CRANE” – contains E (invalid).  
“GRAFT” – contains T, but let’s see: G, R, A, F, T.  
- R in position 2 (invalid, same as before).  

Best valid candidate: “CORAL”.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word (but not yet in the right positions):
- A (not in positions 1, 2, 4)
- R (not in positions 2, 3)
- O (not in positions 2, 3)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- S, E, C, L

So the secret word must contain A, R, O, and two new letters (from the remaining alphabet).  
The remaining unused common consonants are D, G, H, M, N, P, T, etc., and the only vowel left is I or U.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A, R, O exactly once each.
2. Uses two new letters from the allowed set.
3. Places A, R, O in positions they have not been tried in yet:
   - A can now be in positions 3 or 5 (was in 1,2,4)
   - R can now be in positions 1, 4, 5 (was in 2,3)
   - O can now be in positions 1, 4, 5 (was in 2,3)

A good candidate is “GROAN”:
- G and N are new letters.
- R in position 2 was already tried (and failed) in Guess 1, so that’s invalid.

Next candidate: “ROUND”:
- R in position 1 (new position for R)
- O in position 2 (tried in Guess 2, position 2 – invalid)

Next: “MORPH” – contains H and P, but R is in position 2 again (invalid).

Next: “FORGO” – contains F and G, but O is in position 5 (valid), R in position 3 (invalid, was position 3 in Guess 2).

Next: “DRAIN” – contains D and N, A in position 3 (valid), R in position 2 (invalid).

Next: “GRAIN” – G and N, A in position 3 (valid), R in position 2 (invalid).

Next: “PROUD” – P and D, R in position 2 (invalid).

Next: “TROOP” – repeats O, invalid.

Next: “RATIO” – contains I and T, A in position 3 (valid), R in position 1 (valid), O in position 5 (valid).  
This satisfies all constraints:
- Uses A, R, O in new positions.
- Adds two new letters T and I.

Therefore, “RATIO” is a good next guess.

From all feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word:
- A (now confirmed in position 2)
- R (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 2, 3, or 1 from Guess 3)
- O (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 2 or 3 from earlier)

Letters known NOT in the word:
- S, E, C, L, T, I

So the word has:
- A fixed in position 2
- R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5
- O somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but not overlapping with R)

We need two more letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the banned ones). Remaining common consonants: D, G, H, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc. Vowels left: U (since A is used, and E, I, O are considered).

We need a valid 5-letter word with:
- _ A _ _ _
- R in 3,4, or 5
- O in 1,4, or 5 (but not same position as R)
- Two new letters from allowed set

Let’s list possibilities:

1. O A R _ _ → but R would be in position 3 (allowed), but we need two new letters. Example: OAR... but need 5 letters. OAR is 3 letters.

2. _ A O _ _ → O in position 3 (invalid, O cannot be in 3)
3. _ A _ O _ → O in position 4 (allowed)
4. _ A _ _ O → O in position 5 (allowed)

Let’s try _ A _ _ O:
Need R in 3 or 4, and two new letters.

Option: _ A R _ O → need two new letters in 1 and 4.
Example: D A R E O – but E is banned.
B A R G O – B and G are allowed.
B A R G O is valid (means “barge” or “barrow” in some dialects, but is it in Wordle list? Probably not. Let me think of common words.)

Better: M A R K O – M, K allowed? K is not banned, but let’s check: M, A, R, K, O – all allowed letters. This is a valid word (means “marble” or “marrow”).

But let me check R in position 4: _ A _ R O → need two new letters in 1 and 3.
Example: D A M R O – not a word.
H A N R O – not a word.
P A N R O – not a word.

Best seems M A R K O.

But let me verify:
M – allowed
A – fixed in position 2
R – allowed in position 3
K – allowed (not banned)
O – allowed in position 5

This seems valid.

Another candidate: P A R G O – but G and O in positions 4 and 5, but PARGO is not a standard word.

M A R K O seems the best.

But let me think of _ A _ _ O with R in 4: _ A _ R O
Example: D A M R O – not a word.
H A N R O – not a word.
B A N R O – not a word.

Another angle: _ A _ _ O with R in 3: _ A R _ O
Example: B A R G O – but G is allowed, and B is allowed. BARGO is in Wordle list (variant spelling of “barge”).

But BARGO might not be valid. Let me think of common words.

Actually, common words with A in position 2, R in position 3, O in position 5: _ A R _ O
Example: D A R E O – E banned.
F A R M O – F, M allowed. FARM is 4 letters, FARM O is 5 letters – FARM O is not a word.
H A R V O – H, V allowed. HARVO is not a word.

Best seems M A R K O.

But let me check M A R K O: is it a valid Wordle word? Yes, “M A R K O” is valid (means “marble” or “marrow”).

Therefore, I’ll go with M A R K O.

Next: “RATIO” – contains I and T, A in position 3 (valid), R in position 1 (valid), O in position 5 (valid).  
This satisfies all constraints:
- Uses A, R, O in new positions.
- Adds two new letters T and I.

Therefore, “RATIO” is a good next guess.

From all feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word:
- A (now confirmed in position 2)
- R (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 2, 3, or 1 from Guess 3)
- O (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 2 or 3 from earlier)

Letters known NOT in the word:
- S, E, C, L, T, I

So the word has:
- A fixed in position 2
- R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5
- O somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but not overlapping with R)

We need two more letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the banned ones). Remaining common consonants: D, G, H, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc. Vowels left: U (since A is used, and E, I, O are considered).

We need a valid 5-letter word with:
- _ A _ _ _
- R in 3,4, or 5
- O in 1,4, or 5 (but not same position as R)
- Two new letters from allowed set

Let’s list possibilities:

1. O A R _ _ → but R would be in position 3 (allowed), but we need two new letters. Example: OAR... but need 5 letters. OAR is 3 letters.

2. _ A O _ _ → O in position 3 (invalid, O cannot be in 3)
3. _ A _ O _ → O in position 4 (allowed)
4. _ A _ _ O → O in position 5 (allowed)

Let’s try _ A _ _ O:
Need R in 3 or 4, and two new letters.

Option: _ A R _ O → need two new letters in 1 and 4.
Example: D A R E O – but E is banned.
B A R G O – B and G are allowed.
B A R G O is valid (means “barge” or “barrow” in some dialects, but is it in Wordle list? Probably not. Let me think of common words.)

Better: M A R K O – M, K allowed? K is not banned, but let’s check: M, A, R, K, O – all allowed letters. This is a valid word (means “marble” or “marrow”).

But let me check R in position 4: _ A _ R O → need two new letters in 1 and 3.
Example: D A M R O – not a word.
H A N R O – not a word.
P A N R O – not a word.

Best seems M A R K O.

But let me verify:
M – allowed
A – fixed in position 2
R – allowed in position 3
K – allowed (not banned)
O – allowed in position 5

This seems valid.

Another candidate: P A R G O – but G and O in positions 4 and 5, but PARGO is not a standard word.

M A R K O seems the best.

But let me think of _ A _ _ O with R in 4: _ A _ R O
Example: D A M R O – not a word.
H A N R O – not a word.
B A N R O – not a word.

Another angle: _ A _ _ O with R in 3: _ A R _ O
Example: B A R G O – but G is allowed, and B is allowed. BARGO is in Wordle list (variant spelling of “barge”).

But BARGO might not be valid. Let me think of common words.

Actually, common words with A in position 2, R in position 3, O in position 5: _ A R _ O
Example: D A R E O – E banned.
F A R M O – F, M allowed. FARM is 4 letters, FARM O is 5 letters – FARM O is not a word.
H A R V O – H, V allowed. HARVO is not a word.

Best seems M A R K O.

But let me check M A R K O: is it a valid Wordle word? Yes, “M A R K O” is valid (means “marble” or “marrow”).

Therefore, I’ll go with M A R K O.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", etc.

Looking at these options:
- AROSE has 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S)
- SLATE has 2 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (S, L, T)
- CRANE has 2 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (C, R, N)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words. This should give us good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-)  – A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all

So we know:
- Letters present somewhere: A, R, O
- Letters not present: S, E
- Positions 1, 2, 3 for A, R, O are all wrong.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, R, O
- Does NOT contain S or E
- Places A, R, O in positions other than 1, 2, 3 respectively.

A good candidate is “RAINY”:
- R in position 1 (was position 2 before, so new position is fine)
- A in position 2 (was position 1 before, so new position is fine)
- O is not used here, but we can still test new letters
Wait, we need to include A, R, O. Let’s pick “ROAST” but it contains S (invalid).  
Next candidate: “CAROT” – but it’s not a valid English word.  
“CRAVO” – not a valid word.  
“CROAK” – contains K, but let’s check: C, R, O, A, K.  
- C: new letter  
- R in position 2 (was position 2 before, so this is invalid because feedback said R is not in position 2).  

Let’s try “CORAL”:
- C, O, R, A, L  
- O in position 2 (was position 3 before, so new position is fine)  
- R in position 3 (was position 2 before, so new position is fine)  
- A in position 4 (was position 1 before, so new position is fine)  
- L: new letter  
This seems valid.

Another candidate is “CORGI” but it’s less common.  
“CROAK” was invalid because R would be in position 2 again.  
“CRAVE” – contains E (invalid).  
“CRANE” – contains E (invalid).  
“GRAFT” – contains T, but let’s see: G, R, A, F, T.  
- R in position 2 (invalid, same as before).  

Best valid candidate: “CORAL”.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word (but not yet in the right positions):
- A (not in positions 1, 2, 4)
- R (not in positions 2, 3)
- O (not in positions 2, 3)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- S, E, C, L

So the secret word must contain A, R, O, and two new letters (from the remaining alphabet).  
The remaining unused common consonants are D, G, H, M, N, P, T, etc., and the only vowel left is I or U.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A, R, O exactly once each.
2. Uses two new letters from the allowed set.
3. Places A, R, O in positions they have not been tried in yet:
   - A can now be in positions 3 or 5 (was in 1,2,4)
   - R can now be in positions 1, 4, 5 (was in 2,3)
   - O can now be in positions 1, 4, 5 (was in 2,3)

A good candidate is “GROAN”:
- G and N are new letters.
- R in position 2 was already tried (and failed) in Guess 1, so that’s invalid.

Next candidate: “ROUND”:
- R in position 1 (new position for R)
- O in position 2 (tried in Guess 2, position 2 – invalid)

Next: “MORPH” – contains H and P, but R is in position 2 again (invalid).

Next: “FORGO” – contains F and G, but O is in position 5 (valid), R in position 3 (invalid, was position 3 in Guess 2).

Next: “DRAIN” – contains D and N, A in position 3 (valid), R in position 2 (invalid).

Next: “GRAIN” – G and N, A in position 3 (valid), R in position 2 (invalid).

Next: “PROUD” – P and D, R in position 2 (invalid).

Next: “TROOP” – repeats O, invalid.

Next: “RATIO” – contains I and T, A in position 3 (valid), R in position 1 (valid), O in position 5 (valid).  
This satisfies all constraints:
- Uses A, R, O in new positions.
- Adds two new letters T and I.

Therefore, “RATIO” is a good next guess.

From all feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word:
- A (now confirmed in position 2)
- R (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 2, 3, or 1 from Guess 3)
- O (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 2 or 3 from earlier)

Letters known NOT in the word:
- S, E, C, L, T, I

So the word has:
- A fixed in position 2
- R somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5
- O somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but not overlapping with R)

We need two more letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the banned ones). Remaining common consonants: D, G, H, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc. Vowels left: U (since A is used, and E, I, O are considered).

We need a valid 5-letter word with:
- _ A _ _ _
- R in 3,4, or 5
- O in 1,4, or 5 (but not same position as R)
- Two new letters from allowed set

Let’s list possibilities:

1. O A R _ _ → but R would be in position 3 (allowed), but we need two new letters. Example: OAR... but need 5 letters. OAR is 3 letters.

2. _ A O _ _ → O in position 3 (invalid, O cannot be in 3)
3. _ A _ O _ → O in position 4 (allowed)
4. _ A _ _ O → O in position 5 (allowed)

Let’s try _ A _ _ O:
Need R in 3 or 4, and two new letters.

Option: _ A R _ O → need two new letters in 1 and 4.
Example: D A R E O – but E is banned.
B A R G O – B and G are allowed.
B A R G O is valid (means “barge” or “barrow” in some dialects, but is it in Wordle list? Probably not. Let me think of common words.)

Better: M A R K O – M, K allowed? K is not banned, but let’s check: M, A, R, K, O – all allowed letters. This is a valid word (means “marble” or “marrow”).

But let me check R in position 4: _ A _ R O → need two new letters in 1 and 3.
Example: D A M R O – not a word.
H A N R O – not a word.
P A N R O – not a word.

Best seems M A R K O.

But let me verify:
M – allowed
A – fixed in position 2
R – allowed in position 3
K – allowed (not banned)
O – allowed in position 5

This seems valid.

Another candidate: P A R G O – but G and O in positions 4 and 5, but PARGO is not a standard word.

M A R K O seems the best.

But let me think of _ A _ _ O with R in 4: _ A _ R O
Example: D A M R O – not a word.
H A N R O – not a word.
B A N R O – not a word.

Another angle: _ A _ _ O with R in 3: _ A R _ O
Example: B A R G O – but G is allowed, and B is allowed. BARGO is in Wordle list (variant spelling of “barge”).

But BARGO might not be valid. Let me think of common words.

Actually, common words with A in position 2, R in position 3, O in position 5: _ A R _ O
Example: D A R E O – E banned.
F A R M O – F, M allowed. FARM is 4 letters, FARM O is 5 letters – FARM O is not a word.
H A R V O – H, V allowed. HARVO is not a word.

Best seems M A R K O.

But let me check M A R K O: is it a valid Wordle word? Yes, “M A R K O” is valid (means “marble” or “marrow”).

Therefore, I’ll go with M A R K O.

From Guess 4 (MARCO) we now have:

- M ✓ (position 1)
- A ✓ (position 2)
- R – (in word but not position 3)
- C x (not in word)
- O – (in word but not position 5)

Combining all information so far:

Fixed letters:
- M _ _ _ _
- A _ _ _ _

Letters in word but wrong positions:
- R (cannot be in positions 2, 3, 1)
- O (cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5)

Letters not in word:
- S, E, C, L, T, I, C

So:
- R must be in position 4 or 5
- O must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (but not same as R)

We need one more letter (since we have M, A, R, O accounted for). Remaining allowed letters (not yet ruled out) include: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form:
M A _ _ _
with R and O placed in remaining spots, plus one new letter.

Possible patterns:
1. M A O _ R  (O in 3 – invalid, O cannot be in 3)
2. M A _ O R  (O in 4, R in 5)
3. M A _ R O  (O in 5, R in 4)

Check each:

Pattern 2: M A _ O R
Need one new letter in position 3. Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, N, P, U, V, W, Y
Example: M A B O R – not a word
M A D O R – not a word
M A G O R – not a word
M A H O R – not a word
M A N O R – not a word
M A P O R – not a word
M A G O R – not a word
M A B O R – not a word

Pattern 3: M A _ R O
Need one new letter in position 3. Same set of letters.
Example: M A B R O – not a word
M A D R O – not a word
M A G R O – not a word
M A N R O – not a word
M A P R O – not a word
M A G R O – not a word
M A B R O – not a word

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me think of actual words.

Looking at pattern 2: M A _ O R
Possible word: M A J O R – MAJOR is a valid word (means “chief” or “important”).

Check constraints:
- M ✓ (1)
- A ✓ (2)
- J – new letter (allowed)
- O – in word but not 5 (here it is 4 – ok)
- R – in word but not 3 (here it is 5 – ok)

MAJOR fits all constraints.

Therefore, next guess is MAJOR.
