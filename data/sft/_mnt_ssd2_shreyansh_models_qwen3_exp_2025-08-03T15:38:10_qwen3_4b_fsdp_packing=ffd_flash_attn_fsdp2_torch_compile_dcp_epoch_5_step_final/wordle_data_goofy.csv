### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common vowel

This should give me good information about which of these common letters are present in the secret word.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means the secret word contains none of those letters.  
To maximize information, I should now pick a word that uses entirely different letters, especially common ones that weren’t in SLATE.  
Good candidates are words like “CRANE”, “ADIEU”, or “MOUND”.  
I’ll choose “CRANE” because C, R, N, E, and A weren’t in SLATE (except E and A, which we already know are out).  
Wait—actually, A and E were in SLATE and marked as absent, so they’re excluded.

From the feedback so far:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, M, U, N, D
- Letters known to be in the word and in the correct position: O in position 2

So the secret word looks like: _ O _ _ _

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 2nd position.
2. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (no S, L, A, T, E, M, U, N, D).

Remaining common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I (since A, E, U are out)

I’ll try to pick a word with common remaining letters to maximize information. Good candidates:
- B, C, F, G, H, K, P, R, W, Y

Let’s try “PROXY” – but X and Y are less common, and P, R, O, X, Y: O is already in position 2, and P, R, X, Y are still possible.  
Another option is “CORGI” – but C, R, G, I are possible, and O is in position 2.  
But “CORGI” has G and I, which are possible.  
However, “CORGI” is a valid word.

But let me think of simpler words.  
“FORGE” – but E is out.  
“POKER” – but E is out.  
“BROOK” – but O is already in position 2, and we don’t know if there’s another O.  
“CROAK” – but A is out.  
“GROIN” – but N is out.  
“HORSE” – but S, E are out.  
“JOKER” – but E is out.  
“KROON” – but N is out.  
“PRIMO” – but M is out.  
“PROXY” seems the best remaining option with common letters.

But let me check: P, R, O, X, Y – none of these were in the previous guesses except O.  
So “PROXY” is valid.

But actually, “PROXY” is a bit obscure.  
A better choice might be “CRIER” – but E is out.  
“CRIER” is invalid.  
“CROON” – but N is out.  
“CROWN” – but N is out.  
“CRIER” is invalid.  
“CRIER” is invalid.  
“CRIER” is invalid.

I need a word with O in position 2 and letters not ruled out.  
Possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z, and I for vowel.

Let’s try “CHIRP” – but C, H, I, R, P.  
O is in position 2, but this word doesn’t have O.  
I need O in position 2.  
So structure: _ O _ _ _

Possible words:
- B O _ _ _ : B O X E D – but E is out.  
- C O _ _ _ : C O R N – but N is out.  
- F O _ _ _ : F O G S – but S is out.

- K O _ _ _ : K O N N Y – but N is out.  
- P O _ _ _ : P O K E – but E is out.  
- Q O _ _ _ : Q U I K – but U is out.  
- R O _ _ _ : R O U S E – but U, S, E are out.  
- V O _ _ _ : V O G U E – but U, E are out.  
- W O _ _ _ : W O R L D – but L, D are out.  
- X O _ _ _ : X O N – too short.  
- Y O _ _ _ : Y O K E – but E is out.  
- Z O _ _ _ : Z O N – too short.

Hmm, many options are limited.

“BOXER” is invalid.  
“COYPU” – but U is out.  
“COYPU” is invalid.  
“FOCAL” – but A, L are out.  
“FOCAL” is invalid.  
“GONER” – but E is out.  
“GONER” is invalid.  
“HONOR” – but N is out.  
“HONOR” is invalid.  
“JOKER” – but E is out.

“KNOCK” – but N, C, K. N is out.  
“KNOCK” is invalid.  
“POLYP” – but L is out.  
“POLYP” is invalid.  
“PORGY” – but Y is possible, but G, R, P, O, Y.  
“PORGY” is a valid word (a type of fly).

“PORGY” has:
- P, O, R, G, Y – none of these were in the previous guesses except O, and O is in the correct position.  
This seems like a good next guess.

Another option is “PROXY” but “PORGY” is more common.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel

- E: most common vowel

This should give me good information about which of these common letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means the secret word contains none of those letters.  
To maximize information, I should now pick a word that uses entirely different letters, especially common ones that weren’t in SLATE.  
Good candidates are words like “CRANE”, “ADIEU”, or “MOUND”.  
I’ll choose “CRANE” because C, R, N, E, and A weren’t in SLATE (except E and A, which we already know are out).  
Wait—actually, A and E were in SLATE and marked as absent, so they’re excluded.  
I need a word with completely new letters.  
Better choices: “MOUND” (M, O, U, N, D) or “HOUSE” (H, O, U, S, E).  
But S and E are already out.  
So “MOUND” is safer.  
Let me go with “MOUND”.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MOUND -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, M, U, N, D
- Letters known to be in the word and in the correct position: O in position 2

So the secret word looks like: _ O _ _ _

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 2nd position.
2. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (no S, L, A, T, E, M, U, N, D).

Remaining common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I (since A, E, U are out)

I’ll try to pick a word with common remaining letters to maximize information. Good candidates:
- B, C, F, G, H, K, P, R, W, Y

Let’s try “PROXY” – but X and Y are less common, and P, R, O, X, Y: O is already in position 2, and P, R, X, Y are still possible.  
Another option is “CORGI” – but C, R, G, I are possible, and O is in position 2.  
But “CORGI” has G and I, which are possible.  
However, “CORGI” is a valid word.

But let me think of simpler words.  
“FORGE” – but E is out.  
“POKER” – but E is out.  
“BROOK” – but O is already in position 2, and we don’t know if there’s another O.  
“CROAK” – but A is out.  
“GROIN” – but N is out.  
“HORSE” – but S, E are out.  
“JOKER” – but E is out.  
“KROON” – but N is out.  
“PRIMO” – but M is out.  
“PROXY” seems the best remaining option with common letters.

But let me check: P, R, O, X, Y – none of these were in the previous guesses except O.  
So “PROXY” is valid.

But actually, “PROXY” is a bit obscure.  
A better choice might be “CRIER” – but E is out.  
“CRIER” is invalid.  
“CROON” – but N is out.  
“CROWN” – but N is out.  
“CRIER” is invalid.  
“CRIER” is invalid.  
“CRIER” is invalid.  
Wait, let me think differently.  
I need a word with O in position 2 and letters not ruled out.  
Possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z, and I for vowel.

Let’s try “CHIRP” – but C, H, I, R, P.  
O is in position 2, but this word doesn’t have O.  
I need O in position 2.  
So structure: _ O _ _ _

Possible words:
- B O _ _ _ : B O X E D – but E is out.  
- C O _ _ _ : C O R N – but N is out.  
- F O _ _ _ : F O G S – but S is out.  
- G O _ _ _ : G O L F – but L is out.  
- H O _ _ _ : H O R S E – but S, E are out.  
- J O _ _ _ : J O K E R – but E is out.  
- K O _ _ _ : K O N N Y – but N is out.  
- P O _ _ _ : P O K E – but E is out.  
- Q O _ _ _ : Q U I K – but U is out.  
- R O _ _ _ : R O U S E – but U, S, E are out.  
- V O _ _ _ : V O G U E – but U, E are out.  
- W O _ _ _ : W O R L D – but L, D are out.  
- X O _ _ _ : X O N – too short.  
- Y O _ _ _ : Y O K E – but E is out.  
- Z O _ _ _ : Z O N – too short.

Hmm, many options are limited.  
Let me try “BOXER” – but X, E, R. E is out.  
“BOXER” is invalid.  
“COYPU” – but U is out.  
“COYPU” is invalid.  
“FOCAL” – but A, L are out.  
“FOCAL” is invalid.  
“GONER” – but E is out.  
“GONER” is invalid.  
“HONOR” – but N is out.  
“HONOR” is invalid.  
“JOKER” – but E is out.  
“JOKER” is invalid.  
“KNOCK” – but N, C, K. N is out.  
“KNOCK” is invalid.  
“POLYP” – but L is out.  
“POLYP” is invalid.  
“PORGY” – but Y is possible, but G, R, P, O, Y.  
“PORGY” is a valid word (a type of fly).

“PORGY” has:
- P, O, R, G, Y – none of these were in the previous guesses except O, and O is in the correct position.  
This seems like a good next guess.

Another option is “PROXY” but “PORGY” is more common.

So I’ll go with “PORGY”.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, T, E, M, U, N, D, P, R

Letters known to be in the word and their positions:
- O is in position 2 (fixed)
- Y is in position 5 (fixed)
- G is in the word but NOT in position 4

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y
And G must appear in position 1 or 3.

Remaining possible letters (not yet ruled out):  
B, C, F, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus G which must be used.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 2 and Y in position 5.
2. Contains G exactly once, in either position 1 or 3.
3. Uses only the remaining letters.

Possible structures:
- G O _ _ Y  (G in position 1)
- _ O G _ Y  (G in position 3)

Let’s list valid English words fitting these patterns:

G O _ _ Y:
- GOBBY – invalid (B twice, but B is allowed, but GOBBY is uncommon)
- GOLLY – L is already ruled out
- GUMMY – M, M, Y – M is out
- GOOFY – F is allowed, but O is already used in position 2
- GOODY – D is out
- GOUGE – E is out
- GOOFY – already considered
- GOOFY is invalid because F is allowed but the word structure is G O O F Y which repeats O in position 3 (but we don’t know if O repeats)
Actually, GOOFY is G O O F Y – but O is already in position 2, and we don’t have info on repeats. But the word must be valid 5-letter word.

Better to check dictionary:

Valid words:
- GOLLY – L is out
- GOBBY – B is allowed, but GOBBY is obscure
- GOOFY – valid word, but has double O
- GUMMY – M is out
- GONNY – N is out
- GOSHY – S is out
- GOODY – D is out
- GOUGE – E is out

No common words starting with G O _ _ Y seem valid.

Next structure: _ O G _ Y

Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4 from remaining: B, C, F, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

Looking for valid 5-letter words:

B O G _ Y – BOG _ Y: BOGIE, BOGUS, BOGGY, BOGMY (invalid), BOGSEY (invalid) – none fit
C O G _ Y – COG _ Y: COGIE, COGGY – Coggy is valid
F O G _ Y – FOGLY – FOG is allowed, but FOGLY is not standard
H O G _ Y – HOG _ Y: HOGAN (N out), HOGIE, HOGMY (invalid), HOGSEY (invalid) – HOGIE is obscure
J O G _ Y – JOKPY (invalid)
K O G _ Y – KOG _ Y: KOGIY (invalid)
V O G _ Y – VOG _ Y: VOGUE – E is out
W O G _ Y – WOG _ Y: WOGIE (obscure)
X O G _ Y – XOG _ Y: none
Z O G _ Y – ZOG _ Y: ZOGGY (double G invalid)

The only valid common word fitting _ O G _ Y is COGGY (C O G G Y), but it has double G which is allowed since we only know G is in the word but not in position 4. However, CoggY is a valid word (British slang for ""cog"" + ""gy"").

But let me check if C O G G Y is valid – yes, it is in some dictionaries.

Another candidate: BOGIE – but B O G I E, but E is out.

Another: FOGLY – not standard.

Another: HOGIE – H O G I E – E is out.

Another: VOGUE – E is out.

Another: WOGIE – obscure.

Thus, C O G G Y seems the best fit, but let me see if there's a better word.

Wait, let me think differently – maybe G is in position 3 and the word is _ O G _ Y.

Looking for valid words:

B O G _ Y – BOG _ Y: BOGIE (E out), BOGMY (invalid), BOGGY (G twice, but Y is fixed), but BOGGY is B O G G Y – G appears twice, but we don't know if letters can repeat. The rules don't forbid repeats, so BOGGY is possible.

But BOGGY is B O G G Y – G is in position 3 and 4, but feedback says G is in the word but not in position 4 (from PORGY feedback: G(-) means G is in word but not in position 4). So G could be in position 3.

B O G G Y – G is in position 3 and 4. This is allowed since we don't have info against it.

Another: C O G G Y – same issue.

Another: F O G G Y – F O G G Y – valid word? No, ""foggy"" is F O G G Y – yes, that's a valid word.

F O G G Y:
- F: allowed
- O: position 2 (correct)
- G: appears in position 3 and 4, but feedback only said G is not in position 4 (from PORGY: G(-) means not in position 4). So G could be in 3.
- G: also in 4 – but feedback didn't say anything about second G, so it's possible.

But we need to check if FOGGY is valid – yes, it's a common word.

Between BOGGY and FOGGY, both are valid. FOGGY is more common.

Thus, my next guess is FOGGY.

But let me check if there's any other.

Another: J O G G Y – J O G G Y – JOGGY is valid (British slang for ""jolly"").

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common vowel

This should give me good information about which of these common letters are present in the secret word.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means the secret word contains none of those letters.  
To maximize information, I should now pick a word that uses entirely different letters, especially common ones that weren’t in SLATE.  
Good candidates are words like “CRANE”, “ADIEU”, or “MOUND”.  
I’ll choose “CRANE” because C, R, N, E, and A weren’t in SLATE (except E and A, which we already know are out).  
Wait—actually, A and E were in SLATE and marked as absent, so they’re excluded.  
I need a word with completely new letters.  
Better choices: “MOUND” (M, O, U, N, D) or “HOUSE” (H, O, U, S, E).  
But S and E are already out.  
So “MOUND” is safer.  
Let me go with “MOUND”.

From the feedback so far:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, M, U, N, D
- Letters known to be in the word and in the correct position: O in position 2

So the secret word looks like: _ O _ _ _

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 2nd position.
2. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (no S, L, A, T, E, M, U, N, D).

Remaining common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I (since A, E, U are out)

I’ll try to pick a word with common remaining letters to maximize information. Good candidates:
- B, C, F, G, H, K, P, R, W, Y

Let’s try “PROXY” – but X and Y are less common, and P, R, O, X, Y: O is already in position 2, and P, R, X, Y are still possible.  
Another option is “CORGI” – but C, R, G, I are possible, and O is in position 2.  
But “CORGI” has G and I, which are possible.  
However, “CORGI” is a valid word.

But let me think of simpler words.  
“FORGE” – but E is out.  
“POKER” – but E is out.  
“BROOK” – but O is already in position 2, and we don’t know if there’s another O.  
“CROAK” – but A is out.  
“GROIN” – but N is out.  
“HORSE” – but S, E are out.  
“JOKER” – but E is out.  
“KROON” – but N is out.  
“PRIMO” – but M is out.  
“PROXY” seems the best remaining option with common letters.

But let me check: P, R, O, X, Y – none of these were in the previous guesses except O.  
So “PROXY” is valid.

But actually, “PROXY” is a bit obscure.  
A better choice might be “CRIER” – but E is out.  
“CRIER” is invalid.  
“CROON” – but N is out.  
“CROWN” – but N is out.  
“CRIER” is invalid.  
“CRIER” is invalid.  
“CRIER” is invalid.  
Wait, let me think differently.  
I need a word with O in position 2 and letters not ruled out.  
Possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z, and I for vowel.

Let’s try “CHIRP” – but C, H, I, R, P.  
O is in position 2, but this word doesn’t have O.  
I need O in position 2.  
So structure: _ O _ _ _

Possible words:
- B O _ _ _ : B O X E D – but E is out.  
- C O _ _ _ : C O R N – but N is out.  
- F O _ _ _ : F O G S – but S is out.  
- G O _ _ _ : G O L F – but L is out.  
- H O _ _ _ : H O R S E – but S, E are out.  
- J O _ _ _ : J O K E R – but E is out.  
- K O _ _ _ : K O N N Y – but N is out.  
- P O _ _ _ : P O K E – but E is out.  
- Q O _ _ _ : Q U I K – but U is out.  
- R O _ _ _ : R O U S E – but U, S, E are out.  
- V O _ _ _ : V O G U E – but U, E are out.  
- W O _ _ _ : W O R L D – but L, D are out.  
- X O _ _ _ : X O N – too short.  
- Y O _ _ _ : Y O K E – but E is out.  
- Z O _ _ _ : Z O N – too short.

Hmm, many options are limited.  
Let me try “BOXER” – but X, E, R. E is out.  
“BOXER” is invalid.  
“COYPU” – but U is out.  
“COYPU” is invalid.  
“FOCAL” – but A, L are out.  
“FOCAL” is invalid.  
“GONER” – but E is out.  
“GONER” is invalid.  
“HONOR” – but N is out.  
“HONOR” is invalid.  
“JOKER” – but E is out.  
“JOKER” is invalid.  
“KNOCK” – but N, C, K. N is out.  
“KNOCK” is invalid.  
“POLYP” – but L is out.  
“POLYP” is invalid.  
“PORGY” – but Y is possible, but G, R, P, O, Y.  
“PORGY” is a valid word (a type of fly).

“PORGY” has:
- P, O, R, G, Y – none of these were in the previous guesses except O, and O is in the correct position.  
This seems like a good next guess.

Another option is “PROXY” but “PORGY” is more common.

So I’ll go with “PORGY”.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, T, E, M, U, N, D, P, R

Letters known to be in the word and their positions:
- O is in position 2 (fixed)
- Y is in position 5 (fixed)
- G is in the word but NOT in position 4

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ Y
And G must appear in position 1 or 3.

Remaining possible letters (not yet ruled out):  
B, C, F, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z, plus G which must be used.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 2 and Y in position 5.
2. Contains G exactly once, in either position 1 or 3.
3. Uses only the remaining letters.

Possible structures:
- G O _ _ Y  (G in position 1)
- _ O G _ Y  (G in position 3)

Let’s list valid English words fitting these patterns:

G O _ _ Y:
- GOBBY – invalid (B twice, but B is allowed, but GOBBY is uncommon)
- GOLLY – L is already ruled out
- GUMMY – M, M, Y – M is out
- GOOFY – F is allowed, but O is already used in position 2
- GOODY – D is out
- GOUGE – E is out
- GOOFY – already considered
- GOOFY is invalid because F is allowed but the word structure is G O O F Y which repeats O in position 3 (but we don’t know if O repeats)
Actually, GOOFY is G O O F Y – but O is already in position 2, and we don’t have info on repeats. But the word must be valid 5-letter word.

Better to check dictionary:

Valid words:
- GOLLY – L is out
- GOBBY – B is allowed, but GOBBY is obscure
- GOOFY – valid word, but has double O
- GUMMY – M is out
- GONNY – N is out
- GOSHY – S is out
- GOODY – D is out
- GOUGE – E is out

No common words starting with G O _ _ Y seem valid.

Next structure: _ O G _ Y

Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4 from remaining: B, C, F, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

Looking for valid 5-letter words:

B O G _ Y – BOG _ Y: BOGIE, BOGUS, BOGGY, BOGMY (invalid), BOGSEY (invalid) – none fit
C O G _ Y – COG _ Y: COGIE, COGGY – Coggy is valid
F O G _ Y – FOGLY – FOG is allowed, but FOGLY is not standard
H O G _ Y – HOG _ Y: HOGAN (N out), HOGIE, HOGMY (invalid), HOGSEY (invalid) – HOGIE is obscure
J O G _ Y – JOKPY (invalid)
K O G _ Y – KOG _ Y: KOGIY (invalid)
V O G _ Y – VOG _ Y: VOGUE – E is out
W O G _ Y – WOG _ Y: WOGIE (obscure)
X O G _ Y – XOG _ Y: none
Z O G _ Y – ZOG _ Y: ZOGGY (double G invalid)

The only valid common word fitting _ O G _ Y is COGGY (C O G G Y), but it has double G which is allowed since we only know G is in the word but not in position 4. However, CoggY is a valid word (British slang for ""cog"" + ""gy"").

But let me check if C O G G Y is valid – yes, it is in some dictionaries.

Another candidate: BOGIE – but B O G I E, but E is out.

Another: FOGLY – not standard.

Another: HOGIE – H O G I E – E is out.

Another: VOGUE – E is out.

Another: WOGIE – obscure.

Thus, C O G G Y seems the best fit, but let me see if there's a better word.

Wait, let me think differently – maybe G is in position 3 and the word is _ O G _ Y.

Looking for valid words:

B O G _ Y – BOG _ Y: BOGIE (E out), BOGMY (invalid), BOGGY (G twice, but Y is fixed), but BOGGY is B O G G Y – G appears twice, but we don't know if letters can repeat. The rules don't forbid repeats, so BOGGY is possible.

But BOGGY is B O G G Y – G is in position 3 and 4, but feedback says G is in the word but not in position 4 (from PORGY feedback: G(-) means G is in word but not in position 4). So G could be in position 3.

B O G G Y – G is in position 3 and 4. This is allowed since we don't have info against it.

Another: C O G G Y – same issue.

Another: F O G G Y – F O G G Y – valid word? No, ""foggy"" is F O G G Y – yes, that's a valid word.

F O G G Y:
- F: allowed
- O: position 2 (correct)
- G: appears in position 3 and 4, but feedback only said G is not in position 4 (from PORGY: G(-) means not in position 4). So G could be in 3.
- G: also in 4 – but feedback didn't say anything about second G, so it's possible.

But we need to check if FOGGY is valid – yes, it's a common word.

Between BOGGY and FOGGY, both are valid. FOGGY is more common.

Thus, my next guess is FOGGY.

But let me check if there's any other.

Another: H O G G Y – H O G G Y – HOGGY is valid (British slang for ""hairy"", but uncommon).

Another: J O G G Y – J O G G Y – JOGGY is valid (British slang for ""jolly"").

Among these, FOGGY is the most common.

Therefore, my guess is FOGGY.Based on the feedback:
- O is locked in position 2.
- Y is locked in position 5.
- G must appear somewhere in the word (but not in position 4).
- Many letters have been ruled out.

The only viable structure is _ O _ _ Y with G in position 1 or 3.  
The most common valid word fitting _ O G _ Y is **FOGGY** (F O G G Y).

Let's parse the new feedback:

FOGGY → F(-) O(✓) G(-) G(-) Y(✓)

- O is still correct in position 2.
- Y is still correct in position 5.
- F is in the word but not in position 1.
- The first G is in the word but not in position 3.
- The second G is in the word but not in position 4.

This implies:
- The word has the pattern _ O _ _ Y.
- It contains F and G exactly once each (since we only have one F and two G's in the guess, but feedback shows G is in word but not in positions 3 or 4).
- G cannot be in positions 3 or 4, so G must be in position 1.
- F must be in position 4 (since it can't be in position 1 and positions 2 and 5 are taken by O and Y).

Thus the pattern is:
G O _ F Y

We need a valid 5-letter word matching G O _ F Y. The missing letter must be from the remaining unused letters (not yet ruled out). Ruled-out letters so far include S, L, A, T, E, M, U, N, D, P, R, B, C, H, I, J, K, V, W, X, Z (from previous guesses). The only remaining consonants are Q (but Q usually needs a U which is out) and no vowels left except possibly I or U, but both are out. 

Looking at the pattern G O _ F Y, the third letter must be a consonant that hasn't been ruled out. The only common consonant left is Q, but that would make G O Q F Y, which isn't a valid word. 

This suggests we might have made an error in assuming G appears only once. Let's reconsider:

From PORGY: G(-) means G is in the word but not in position 4.
From FOGGY: the first G is (-) so not in position 3, and the second G is (-) so not in position 4. This implies G must appear at least twice, but we've only used G once in PORGY and once in FOGGY. This seems contradictory unless the word has two G's. 

But the word can't have two G's because we've only seen one G in feedback. This suggests the word likely has only one G, and our earlier deduction that G must be in position 1 is correct. 

Given that, the only possible word fitting G O _ F Y is G O N F Y (but N is out), G O B F Y (B is allowed but B O B F Y isn't a word), etc. 

However, there's a valid word: G O L F Y – but L is out. 

Wait, let me check the remaining letters again. Actually, the remaining letters include B, C, F, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z. 

Looking at G O _ F Y, the only possible valid word is G O L F Y, but L is ruled out. 

This suggests the word must have two G's. Let's try G O G F Y – but this isn't a valid word. 

Another possibility: G O _ F Y with a different letter. The only valid word seems to be G O L F Y, but L is out. 

This indicates we might have missed a valid word earlier. Let me re-examine possible _ O G _ Y words:

Looking at _ O G _ Y, the valid word is actually ""COGMY"" (invalid), ""BOGMY"" (invalid), but ""COGIE"" (E out), ""COGGY"" (G twice, but Y is fixed). 

But ""COGGY"" is C O G G Y – this fits the pattern with two G's. 

However, from PORGY feedback, G is in word but not in position 4. In C OG G Y, G is in positions 3 and 4. This would mean the first G (position 3) is (-) which matches, and the second G (position 4) is (-) which also matches. 

Thus, the word could be C O G G Y. 

But let me check if there's another word. 

Another possibility is ""BOGGY"" (B O G G Y), but B is allowed. 

Between C and B, both are possible. 

The most common word is likely ""BOGGY"". 

Thus, the next guess is B O G G Y.

But wait, from FOGGY feedback, F is (-) meaning F is in word but not in position 1. This implies F must be in position 4, making the pattern G O _ F Y. 

This seems to be the only consistent pattern. 

The only valid word fitting G O _ F Y is G O L F Y (L out), G O B F Y (invalid), etc. 

This suggests the word must have two G's and the pattern is G O G _ Y, but this isn't valid. 

Re-evaluating: the feedback indicates F is in the word but not in position 1, and G is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4. This implies:

- Pattern: _ O _ _ Y
- G must be in position 1 (only remaining spot)
- F must be in position 4 (only remaining spot not ruled out)
- Position 3 must be a letter not yet ruled out.

Ruled-out letters include: S, L, A, T, E, M, U, N, D, P, R, B, C, H, I, J, K, V, W, X, Z (from previous guesses). 

The only remaining consonant is Q, but G O Q F Y isn't a word. 

This indicates an inconsistency, meaning our assumption might be wrong. 

Upon closer inspection, the word must be G O L F Y, but L is ruled out. 

This suggests the word is actually G O N F Y (N is out), indicating no perfect fit. 

Rechecking: the only valid word fitting all constraints appears to be G O L F Y, but L is out. 

This implies the word must be ""GOOFY"" (G O O F Y), but O is already in position 2 and we don't know about repeats. 

However, ""GOOFY"" has O in position 2 and 3, which might be acceptable. 

But from PORGY, G is (-) meaning not in position 4, and in GOOFY, G is in position 1, which is allowed. 

Thus, ""GOOFY"" fits all constraints:

- G in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 2 (correct)
- F in position 4 (allowed)
- O in position 3 (possible repeat)
- Y in position 5 (correct)

Therefore, the next guess is GOOFY.

Based on the latest feedback:
- O is locked in position 2.
- Y is locked in position 5.
- G must be in position 1 (only remaining spot not ruled out).
- F must be in position 4 (only remaining spot not ruled out).
- Position 3 must be a letter not yet ruled out.

The only valid 5-letter word fitting G O _ F Y is **GOOFY** (G O O F Y).
