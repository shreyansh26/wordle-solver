### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a broad range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback.

A good starting word should:
1. Use common letters (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I)
2. Include both vowels and consonants
3. Avoid repeating letters to test more unique letters

One of the most common and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of letters to work with.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A somewhere (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
2. Does NOT have S, L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, B, D, G, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: O, I, U (since A is confirmed and E is out).

Let’s try a word that places A in a new position and introduces several new consonants. ""CRANK"" is a strong choice because:
- A is in position 4 (new position).
- C, R, N, K are all common and untested.

From the two guesses so far:

Guess 1: SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
Guess 2: CRANK → C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) K(x)

What we know:
- The letter **R** is in the word and in the **correct position 2**.
- The letter **A** is in the word but **not** in positions 3 or 4 (from SLATE and CRANK).
- The letters **S, L, T, E, C, N, K** are **not** in the word.

So the pattern so far:  
_ R _ _ _  
and A must appear in position 1, 5, or (if it can be in 3 or 4) but we already know it’s not in 3 or 4.

Therefore A must be in position 1 or 5.

Remaining common letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Keeps R in position 2.
- Puts A in position 1 (to test that slot).
- Introduces new consonants and possibly the vowel I or O.

A good candidate is **ARBOR**:
- A in position 1.
- R in position 2 (confirmed).
- B, O in new positions.
- R in position 5.

This tests A in position 1 and introduces B, O.
