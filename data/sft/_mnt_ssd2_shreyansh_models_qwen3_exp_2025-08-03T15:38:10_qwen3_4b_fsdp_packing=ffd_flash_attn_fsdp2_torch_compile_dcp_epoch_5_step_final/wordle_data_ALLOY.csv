### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which will give us good coverage for the first guess.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
2. ADOBO → A(✓) D(x) O(-) B(x) O(-)
3. AFOUL → A(✓) F(x) O(-) U(x) L(-)

What we know:
- The word starts with A (position 1 fixed).
- The letter O appears at least once, but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from ADOBO and AFOUL).
- The letter L is in the word but NOT in position 5 (from AFOUL).
- Forbidden letters so far: R, S, E, D, B, F, U.
- We still need to place O somewhere (positions 1 is A, so O must be in 4).
- We also need to place L somewhere (positions 2, 3, or 4, but 4 is O, so positions 2 or 3).

So the pattern is: A _ _ O _ with L in position 2 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- A L _ O _
- A _ L O _

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit these patterns and avoid all forbidden letters.

Pattern A L _ O _:
- ALONE – but E is forbidden.
- ALLOY – has Y, which is allowed, but double L might be okay.
- ALGOL – G is allowed, but this seems technical.
- ALKOO – not a valid word.
- ALMON – not a valid word.

Pattern A _ L O _:
- A B L O – invalid.
- A C L O – invalid.
- A G L O – invalid.
- A K L O – invalid.
- A M L O – invalid.
- A P L O – invalid.
- A V L O – invalid.
- A W L O – invalid.
- A Y L O – invalid.

Wait, let's think of common words:
- A _ L O _ : ""AMPLE"" – but E is forbidden.
- ""AMPLE"" – E is forbidden.
- ""AMPLE"" – E is forbidden.
- ""AMPLE"" – E is forbidden.

Hmm, maybe ""AMPLE"" is invalid due to E. Let's think differently.

Actually, ""AMPLE"" is invalid because E is forbidden. Let's think of other words.

Looking at pattern A _ _ O _ with L in position 2 or 3:
- A L _ O _ : ""ALLOY"" – valid word, Y is allowed, no forbidden letters.
- A _ L O _ : ""AMPLE"" – invalid due to E.

""ALLOY"" seems valid:
- A ✓
- L in position 2 (allowed)
- L in position 3 (allowed)
- O in position 4 (allowed)
- Y is allowed (not forbidden)

Let me check if there's any other word. ""ALLOY"" seems the best fit.
