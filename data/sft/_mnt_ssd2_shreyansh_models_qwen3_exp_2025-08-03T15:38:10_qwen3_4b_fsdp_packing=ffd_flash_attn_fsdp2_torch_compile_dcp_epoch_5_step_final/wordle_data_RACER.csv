### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives me maximum information about the vowels and two very common consonants right away.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and E which are very common. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

  – R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.
  – E is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 5.

We still need to place A, R, E into valid positions and fill the remaining two slots with letters we haven’t ruled out yet.

Remaining unused consonants that are still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z  
Vowels still possible: I, U (A and E are already confirmed, O is ruled out)

We want a word that:
1. Has A in position 2.
2. Uses R and E in positions that haven’t been ruled out for them.
3. Adds two new consonants that haven’t been tested.

A good candidate is “BREAD”:
- A is in position 2 ✓
- R is in position 3 → was ruled out for position 3 in round 2, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: “CARET”
- A in position 2 ✓
- R in position 3 → again ruled out.

Next: “TARDE” – but E in position 5 was ruled out.

Next: “REACT”
- A in position 2 ✓
- R in position 1 (allowed, since R was only ruled out of positions 2 and 3)
- E in position 4 (allowed, since E was only ruled out of positions 1 and 5)
- C and T are new letters.

This seems valid.

Another quick check: “CREAM”
- A in position 2 ✓
- R in position 3 → ruled out.

“DREAD” – R in 3 again.

“PRAET” – not a valid English word.

“TREAD”:
- A in position 2 ✓
- R in position 3 → ruled out.

“GRAPE”:
- A in position 2 ✓
- R in position 3 → ruled out.

“HAREM”:
- A in position 2 ✓
- R in position 3 → ruled out.

“BREAD” already failed.

“WATER”:
- A in position 2 ✓
- R in position 4 (allowed)
- E in position 5 → ruled out.

“CATER”:
- A in position 2 ✓
- R in position 4 (allowed)
- E in position 3 (allowed)
- C and T new.

This seems good.

Between “REACT” and “CATER”, “CATER” uses more common letters and is a valid English word.

So I’ll go with CATER.

From the new feedback on CATER:

C(-) → C is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).  
A(✓) → A is correctly in position 2.  
T(x) → T is NOT in the word.  
E(✓) → E is correctly in position 4.  
R(✓) → R is correctly in position 5.

So the secret word has the pattern: _ A _ E R

Letters we know are in the word: A, E, R, C  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, S, L, Y, T

We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters that:
- have not been ruled out (so not O, S, L, Y, T)  
- have not been placed yet (C is already in the word but not in position 1, so C could still be in position 3)

Possible consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Possible vowels left: I, U (A and E are already used, O is ruled out)

Let’s look for a valid 5-letter word that fits _ A _ E R and uses C somewhere (since C is in the word but not in position 1).

Candidate words:
- BACER – invalid (not a common word)  
- DACHER – invalid (6 letters)  
- FACER – valid word, uses C in position 3

- All letters are allowed and fit the pattern.

Therefore, FACER is the logical next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives me maximum information about the vowels and two very common consonants right away.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and E which are very common. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd).
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but in the wrong position (not 5th).

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, and E (but not in positions 1, 2, and 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain O or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A, R, E in different positions.
2. Avoids O and S entirely.
3. Uses two new consonants to test more letters.

A good candidate is ""EARLY"":
- E is now in position 1 (was 5th, so this is new).
- A is now in position 2 (was 1st, so this is new).
- R is now in position 3 (was 2nd, so this is new).
- L and Y are new letters to test.

This should give me information about the new positions of A, R, E and test L and Y.

Round 1: A R O S E  
Feedback: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)

Round 2: E A R L Y  
Feedback: E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)

What we now know:
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, R, E  
- Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S, L, Y  
- Known positions:
  – A is in position 2 (from round 2).
  – R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.
  – E is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 5.

We still need to place A, R, E into valid positions and fill the remaining two slots with letters we haven’t ruled out yet.

Remaining unused consonants that are still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z  
Vowels still possible: I, U (A and E are already confirmed, O is ruled out)

We want a word that:
1. Has A in position 2.
2. Uses R and E in positions that haven’t been ruled out for them.
3. Adds two new consonants that haven’t been tested.

A good candidate is “BREAD”:
- A is in position 2 ✓
- R is in position 3 → was ruled out for position 3 in round 2, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: “CARET”
- A in position 2 ✓
- R in position 3 → again ruled out.

Next: “TARDE” – but E in position 5 was ruled out.

Next: “REACT”
- A in position 2 ✓
- R in position 1 (allowed, since R was only ruled out of positions 2 and 3)
- E in position 4 (allowed, since E was only ruled out of positions 1 and 5)
- C and T are new letters.

This seems valid.

Another quick check: “CREAM”
- A in position 2 ✓
- R in position 3 → ruled out.

“DREAD” – R in 3 again.

“PRAET” – not a valid English word.

“TREAD”:
- A in position 2 ✓
- R in position 3 → ruled out.

“GRAPE”:
- A in position 2 ✓
- R in position 3 → ruled out.

“HAREM”:
- A in position 2 ✓
- R in position 3 → ruled out.

“BREAD” already failed.

“WATER”:
- A in position 2 ✓
- R in position 4 (allowed)
- E in position 5 → ruled out.

“CATER”:
- A in position 2 ✓
- R in position 4 (allowed)
- E in position 3 (allowed)
- C and T new.

This seems good.

Between “REACT” and “CATER”, “CATER” uses more common letters and is a valid English word.

So I’ll go with CATER.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with multiple vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives me maximum information about the vowels and two very common consonants right away.

Another good option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and E which are very common. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd).
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but in the wrong position (not 5th).

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, and E (but not in positions 1, 2, and 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain O or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A, R, E in different positions.
2. Avoids O and S entirely.
3. Uses two new consonants to test more letters.

A good candidate is ""EARLY"":
- E is now in position 1 (was 5th, so this is new).
- A is now in position 2 (was 1st, so this is new).
- R is now in position 3 (was 2nd, so this is new).
- L and Y are new letters to test.

This should give me information about the new positions of A, R, E and test L and Y.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: A R O S E  
Feedback: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)

Round 2: E A R L Y  
Feedback: E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)

What we now know:
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, R, E  
- Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S, L, Y  
- Known positions:
  – A is in position 2 (from round 2).
  – R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.
  – E is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 5.

We still need to place A, R, E into valid positions and fill the remaining two slots with letters we haven’t ruled out yet.

Remaining unused consonants that are still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z  
Vowels still possible: I, U (A and E are already confirmed, O is ruled out)

We want a word that:
1. Has A in position 2.
2. Uses R and E in positions that haven’t been ruled out for them.
3. Adds two new consonants that haven’t been tested.

A good candidate is “BREAD”:
- A is in position 2 ✓
- R is in position 3 → was ruled out for position 3 in round 2, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: “CARET”
- A in position 2 ✓
- R in position 3 → again ruled out.

Next: “TARDE” – but E in position 5 was ruled out.

Next: “REACT”
- A in position 2 ✓
- R in position 1 (allowed, since R was only ruled out of positions 2 and 3)
- E in position 4 (allowed, since E was only ruled out of positions 1 and 5)
- C and T are new letters.

This seems valid.

Another quick check: “CREAM”
- A in position 2 ✓
- R in position 3 → ruled out.

“DREAD” – R in 3 again.

“PRAET” – not a valid English word.

“TREAD”:
- A in position 2 ✓
- R in position 3 → ruled out.

“GRAPE”:
- A in position 2 ✓
- R in position 3 → ruled out.

“HAREM”:
- A in position 2 ✓
- R in position 3 → ruled out.

“BREAD” already failed.

“WATER”:
- A in position 2 ✓
- R in position 4 (allowed)
- E in position 5 → ruled out.

“CATER”:
- A in position 2 ✓
- R in position 4 (allowed)
- E in position 3 (allowed)
- C and T new.

This seems good.

Between “REACT” and “CATER”, “CATER” uses more common letters and is a valid English word.

So I’ll go with CATER.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: CATER -> FEEDBACK: C(-) A(✓) T(x) E(✓) R(✓)

From the new feedback on CATER:

C(-) → C is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).  
A(✓) → A is correctly in position 2.  
T(x) → T is NOT in the word.  
E(✓) → E is correctly in position 4.  
R(✓) → R is correctly in position 5.

So the secret word has the pattern: _ A _ E R

Letters we know are in the word: A, E, R, C  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, S, L, Y, T

We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters that:
- have not been ruled out (so not O, S, L, Y, T)  
- have not been placed yet (C is already in the word but not in position 1, so C could still be in position 3)

Possible consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Possible vowels left: I, U (A and E are already used, O is ruled out)

Let’s look for a valid 5-letter word that fits _ A _ E R and uses C somewhere (since C is in the word but not in position 1).

Candidate words:
- BACER – invalid (not a common word)  
- DACHER – invalid (6 letters)  
- FACER – valid word, uses C in position 3  
- HACER – valid in Spanish but not English  
- MACER – valid (a type of processor)  
- PACHER – invalid  
- WACER – invalid  
- FACER is the clearest English word.

Let me check FACER:
- F A C E R  
- C is in position 3 (allowed, since C was only marked wrong for position 1)  
- All letters are allowed and fit the pattern.

Therefore, FACER is the logical next guess.

The only remaining common word is **WACER** (a variant spelling of “wacer” meaning a water sprite), but it’s quite obscure.  
However, **HACER** is a valid English word (used in phrases like “to hacer a point”).  
Among the more common ones, **MACER** is the closest (short for macerator).

But let’s check **HACER** first since it’s more recognizable.
