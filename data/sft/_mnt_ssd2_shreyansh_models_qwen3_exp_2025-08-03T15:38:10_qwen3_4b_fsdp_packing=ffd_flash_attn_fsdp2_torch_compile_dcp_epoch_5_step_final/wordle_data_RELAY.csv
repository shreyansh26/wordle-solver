### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use several of these.

Looking at common starting words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a high chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but ""AROSE"" covers more vowels. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides better vowel coverage for the first guess.

- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x): O is NOT in the word
- S(x): S is NOT in the word

- Letters that must appear: A, R, E (each somewhere other than their original spots)
- Letters that cannot appear: O, S
- We still need two more distinct letters (from the remaining common ones: T, L, N, I, C, etc.)

Good next step: place A, R, E in new positions while introducing fresh common letters.  
A word like ""REACT"" would use R, E, A plus C and T, but C and T are both common.  
But let’s try ""REACT"":
- R would be in position 1 (originally position 2 – allowed)
- E in position 2 (originally 5 – allowed)

- C and T are new letters.

A good starting word should use several of these.\n\nLooking at common starting words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a high chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word.\n\nAnother strong candidate is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but ""AROSE"" covers more vowels. I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides better vowel coverage for the first guess.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1\n- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2\n- O(x): O is NOT in the word\n- S(x): S is NOT in the word\n- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5\n\nSo we know:\n- Letters that must appear: A, R, E (each somewhere other than their original spots)\n- Letters that cannot appear: O, S\n- We still need two more distinct letters (from the remaining common ones: T, L, N, I, C, etc.)\n\nGood next step: place A, R, E in new positions while introducing fresh common letters.  \nA word like ""REACT"" would use R, E, A plus C and T, but C and T are both common.  \nBut let’s try ""REACT"":\n- R would be in position 1 (originally position 2 – allowed)\n- E in position 2 (originally 5 – allowed)\n- A in position 3 (originally 1 – allowed)\n- C and T are new letters.\n\nThis seems like a strong second guess to narrow down possibilities.\n\n<guess>REACT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: REACT -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) A(-) C(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback on REACT:\n- R(✓) – R is in position 1 and is correct.\n- E(✓) – E is in position 2 and is correct.\n- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.\n- C(x) – C is not in the word.\n- T(x) – T is not in the word.\n\nSo we now know:\n- The word starts with “RE”.\n- It must contain A, but A cannot be in position 3.\n- It cannot contain O, S, C, or T.\n\nLetters still available for positions 3, 4, 5: common ones left include I, N, L, D, G, B, M, etc.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that begins with “RE”, contains an A not in position 3, and uses none of the eliminated letters.\n\nPossible candidates:\n- REBID (but B and D are okay, and A is in position 3 – invalid)\n- REFIN (but N is okay, A is in position 3 – invalid)\n- REGAL (but G and L are okay, A is in position 4 – valid)\n- RELAX (but X is uncommon, but valid; A is in position 4 – valid)\n- REMIX (but M and X; A is in position 3 – invalid)\n- REPAY (but P and Y; A is in position 4 – valid)\n\n“REGAL” seems good: starts with RE, has A in position 4, and uses G and L which haven’t been eliminated.\n\n<guess>REGAL</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: REACT -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) A(-) C(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: REGAL -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) E(✓) G(x) A(✓) L(-)\n'}]","<think>
Current confirmed information:
1. Word pattern: R E _ A _
2. Letters known to be in the word: R, E, A, and L (since L got “-” in position 5, it is in the word but not in position 5).
3. Letters ruled out: O, S, C, T, G.
4. L must be in position 3 or 4 (since it can’t be in position 5).
5. Position 4 is already taken by A (confirmed ✓), so L must be in position 3.
6. Therefore the pattern is: R E L A _
7. Only position 5 remains. We need a letter that has not been used or ruled out yet and makes a valid 5-letter word starting with “RELA”.
   – Common unused letters: D, N, M, B, F, H, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
   – Valid words: RELAX, RELAP, RELAY, RELIC (but I and C are okay? Wait C is ruled out), RELAM, RELIN, RELIC (C is ruled out), RELUM, RELAX, RELAY.
   – From these, RELAX and RELAY are the most common.
   – Between them, RELAY is more common and uses Y which hasn’t been ruled out.

Let’s test RELAY.
