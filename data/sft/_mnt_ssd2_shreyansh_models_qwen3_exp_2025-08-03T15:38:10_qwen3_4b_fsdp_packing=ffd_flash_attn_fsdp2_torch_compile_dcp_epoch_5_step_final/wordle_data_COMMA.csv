For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters, including at least one vowel.

Looking at common starting words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This gives us maximum coverage of frequently used letters in English 5-letter words.

Another strong option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and E, which are very common. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a good balance of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.  
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.  
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.  
- S(x): S is not in the word.  
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and O, but not R, S, or E.  
- A is not in position 1, O is not in position 3.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A and O.  
- Does not contain R, S, or E.  
- Places A somewhere other than position 1, and O somewhere other than position 3.

Good consonants to try next are T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.  
Let’s pick a word that places A and O in new positions and introduces new common consonants.

A word like “TAO” plus two consonants: “TAO” is 3 letters.  
Try “TAOON” – but that repeats O.  
Better: “TANGO” – but G is less common.  
“PAINT” – but E is excluded, and we don’t know about I or N yet.  
“PLAID” – but D is less common.  
“CLOAK” – but C and L are good, but K is less common.  
“GLOAT” – but G is less common.  
“MODEL” – but E is excluded.  
“PLANK” – but K is less common.  
“ALLOY” – but Y is less common.  
“ABOUT” – but U is a new vowel we haven’t tested.  
“ABOUT” has A in position 2, O in position 3 (but O cannot be in position 3), so that’s invalid.

Alternative: “COAST” – but S is excluded.  
“COBIA” – but B and I are less common.  
“COG” is too short.  
“COVET” – E is excluded.  
“COVET” is invalid.  
“COYPU” – too obscure.  
“COBOL” – but O is in position 3, which is invalid.

Better to focus on common words.  
Try “PAINT” – but E is excluded, and we don’t know about I or N yet.  
“PAINT” has A in position 2, O is not present – so invalid.  
We must have O somewhere.

Try “PLAID” – but D is less common.  
“PLAID” has A in position 3, which is allowed (O is in position 2).  
But we need to check if any letters are excluded.  
R, S, E are excluded.  
“PLAID” has P, L, A, I, D – none of R, S, E.  
A is in position 3 (allowed), O is not present – so invalid.  
We must have O.

Try “PAINT” – but no O.  
Try “COINS” – S excluded.  
“COINS” invalid.  
“COINS” has no O.

Try “CLOAK” – no O.  
“CLOAK” has C, L, O, A, K – O is in position 3 (invalid).  
So “CLOAK” invalid.

Try “COBOL” – O in position 3 (invalid).  
Try “COBIA” – no O.  
Try “COG” – too short.

Alternative approach: list 5-letter words with A and O, excluding R, S, E, with A not in 1 and O not in 3.

Let’s try “ABOUT” – but O in position 3 invalid.  
“ADOPT” – O in position 3 invalid.  
“ADOBE” – E excluded.  
“ADOPT” invalid.  
“ALOHA” – H is less common, but A is in position 4 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed).  
“ALOHA” has A in 4, O in 2, no R, S, E.  
That seems valid.

“ALOHA” is a valid 5-letter word, contains A and O, no R/S/E, A not in 1, O not in 3.  
So “ALOHA” is a good next guess.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters, including at least one vowel.

Looking at common starting words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This gives us maximum coverage of frequently used letters in English 5-letter words.

Another strong option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and E, which are very common. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a good balance of vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.  
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.  
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.  
- S(x): S is not in the word.  
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and O, but not R, S, or E.  
- A is not in position 1, O is not in position 3.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A and O.  
- Does not contain R, S, or E.  
- Places A somewhere other than position 1, and O somewhere other than position 3.

Good consonants to try next are T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.  
Let’s pick a word that places A and O in new positions and introduces new common consonants.

A word like “TAO” plus two consonants: “TAO” is 3 letters.  
Try “TAOON” – but that repeats O.  
Better: “TANGO” – but G is less common.  
“PAINT” – but E is excluded, and we don’t know about I or N yet.  
“PLAID” – but D is less common.  
“CLOAK” – but C and L are good, but K is less common.  
“GLOAT” – but G is less common.  
“MODEL” – but E is excluded.  
“PLANK” – but K is less common.  
“ALLOY” – but Y is less common.  
“ABOUT” – but U is a new vowel we haven’t tested.  
“ABOUT” has A in position 2, O in position 3 (but O cannot be in position 3), so that’s invalid.

Alternative: “COAST” – but S is excluded.  
“COBIA” – but B and I are less common.  
“COG” is too short.  
“COVET” – E is excluded.  
“COVET” is invalid.  
“COYPU” – too obscure.  
“COBOL” – but O is in position 3, which is invalid.

Better to focus on common words.  
Try “PAINT” – but E is excluded, and we don’t know about I or N yet.  
“PAINT” has A in position 2, O is not present – so invalid.  
We must have O somewhere.

Try “PLAID” – but D is less common.  
“PLAID” has A in position 3, which is allowed (O is in position 2).  
But we need to check if any letters are excluded.  
R, S, E are excluded.  
“PLAID” has P, L, A, I, D – none of R, S, E.  
A is in position 3 (allowed), O is not present – so invalid.  
We must have O.

Try “PAINT” – but no O.  
Try “COINS” – S excluded.  
“COINS” invalid.  
“COINS” has no O.

Try “CLOAK” – no O.  
“CLOAK” has C, L, O, A, K – O is in position 3 (invalid).  
So “CLOAK” invalid.

Try “COBOL” – O in position 3 (invalid).  
Try “COBIA” – no O.  
Try “COG” – too short.

Alternative approach: list 5-letter words with A and O, excluding R, S, E, with A not in 1 and O not in 3.

Let’s try “ABOUT” – but O in position 3 invalid.  
“ADOPT” – O in position 3 invalid.  
“ADOBE” – E excluded.  
“ADOPT” invalid.  
“ALOHA” – H is less common, but A is in position 4 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed).  
“ALOHA” has A in 4, O in 2, no R, S, E.  
That seems valid.

“ALOHA” is a valid 5-letter word, contains A and O, no R/S/E, A not in 1, O not in 3.  
So “ALOHA” is a good next guess.

Possible letters for position 3: from the remaining alphabet (excluding the banned letters). The remaining common consonants include D, F, G, K, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s list valid words fitting C O _ O A:

- COCOA – but C is already used in position 1, and we don’t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, C is already confirmed in position 1, so this might be possible, but let’s check others first.

- COG OA – not valid.
- COM OA – not valid.
- COP OA – not valid.
- COT OA – not valid.
- COU OA – not valid.
- COY OA – not valid.

Looking at valid English words: the only common word that fits C O _ O A is COCOA, but that would reuse C in position 1 and 4, which might not be allowed since letters in Wordle can repeat unless ruled out by feedback. However, in our case, the feedback only tells us about the positions of C, O, B, I, A. Since B and I are excluded, and C, O, A are confirmed in positions 1, 4, 5, the only remaining possibility is COCOA.

But let me double-check: is there any other word? COG OA, etc., are not valid. So COCOA seems to be the only valid word left.

However, COCOA is a valid 5-letter word (a type of drink), and it fits the pattern C O C O A. The letters used are C, O, C, O, A – none of which are excluded except possibly C and O being already confirmed. Since duplicates are allowed in Wordle, COCOA is a valid guess.

But wait – the feedback for guess 3 (cobia) showed:
C(✓) O(✓) B(x) I(x) A(✓)

This means:
- C is correct in position 1.
- O is correct in position 2.
- B is not in the word.
- I is not in the word.
- A is correct in position 5.

So the pattern is actually:
C O _ _ A

And we know from guess 2 (aloha) that O is in the word but NOT in position 3. From guess 3, we see that O is in position 2, so the third position is unknown but not O.

Also, from guess 1 and 2, we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, L, H, B, I.
- So the third and fourth positions must be filled from the remaining letters: D, F, G, K, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words C O _ _ A with no B, I, R, S, E, L, H:

Possible words:

Is CONGA a valid word? Yes, it means to stomp or beat with boots, and it's in standard word lists.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters, including at least one vowel.

Looking at common starting words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This gives us maximum coverage of frequently used letters in English 5-letter words.

Another strong option would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O and E, which are very common. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a good balance of vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.  
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.  
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.  
- S(x): S is not in the word.  
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and O, but not R, S, or E.  
- A is not in position 1, O is not in position 3.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A and O.  
- Does not contain R, S, or E.  
- Places A somewhere other than position 1, and O somewhere other than position 3.

Good consonants to try next are T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.  
Let’s pick a word that places A and O in new positions and introduces new common consonants.

A word like “TAO” plus two consonants: “TAO” is 3 letters.  
Try “TAOON” – but that repeats O.  
Better: “TANGO” – but G is less common.  
“PAINT” – but E is excluded, and we don’t know about I or N yet.  
“PLAID” – but D is less common.  
“CLOAK” – but C and L are good, but K is less common.  
“GLOAT” – but G is less common.  
“MODEL” – but E is excluded.  
“PLANK” – but K is less common.  
“ALLOY” – but Y is less common.  
“ABOUT” – but U is a new vowel we haven’t tested.  
“ABOUT” has A in position 2, O in position 3 (but O cannot be in position 3), so that’s invalid.

Alternative: “COAST” – but S is excluded.  
“COBIA” – but B and I are less common.  
“COG” is too short.  
“COVET” – E is excluded.  
“COVET” is invalid.  
“COYPU” – too obscure.  
“COBOL” – but O is in position 3, which is invalid.

Better to focus on common words.  
Try “PAINT” – but E is excluded, and we don’t know about I or N yet.  
“PAINT” has A in position 2, O is not present – so invalid.  
We must have O somewhere.

Try “PLAID” – but D is less common.  
“PLAID” has A in position 3, which is allowed (O is in position 2).  
But we need to check if any letters are excluded.  
R, S, E are excluded.  
“PLAID” has P, L, A, I, D – none of R, S, E.  
A is in position 3 (allowed), O is not present – so invalid.  
We must have O.

Try “PAINT” – but no O.  
Try “COINS” – S excluded.  
“COINS” invalid.  
“COINS” has no O.

Try “CLOAK” – no O.  
“CLOAK” has C, L, O, A, K – O is in position 3 (invalid).  
So “CLOAK” invalid.

Try “COBOL” – O in position 3 (invalid).  
Try “COBIA” – no O.  
Try “COG” – too short.

Alternative approach: list 5-letter words with A and O, excluding R, S, E, with A not in 1 and O not in 3.

Let’s try “ABOUT” – but O in position 3 invalid.  
“ADOPT” – O in position 3 invalid.  
“ADOBE” – E excluded.  
“ADOPT” invalid.  
“ALOHA” – H is less common, but A is in position 4 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed).  
“ALOHA” has A in 4, O in 2, no R, S, E.  
That seems valid.

“ALOHA” is a valid 5-letter word, contains A and O, no R/S/E, A not in 1, O not in 3.  
So “ALOHA” is a good next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - R, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. aloha → A(-) L(x) O(-) H(x) A(✓)
   - The first A is in the word but NOT in position 1 (already known).
   - L and H are NOT in the word.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (already known).
   - The last A is in position 5 and is CORRECT.

So the secret word:
- Ends with A (position 5 = A).
- Contains O but NOT in position 3.
- Does NOT contain R, S, E, L, H.

Letters still possible: A, B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Positions:
- Position 5 = A.
- Position 3 ≠ O.

We need a word with:
- A in position 5.
- O somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- No R, S, E, L, H.

Let’s list possible patterns:
- O _ _ _ A (O in 1)
- _ O _ _ A (O in 2)
- _ _ _ O A (O in 4)  ← O cannot be in 3.

Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, K, M, N, P, T, W, Y.

Let’s think of words fitting these patterns.

Pattern _ O _ _ A:
- Could be ""BOGSA"" – but S is excluded.
- ""DOGMA"" – but M is allowed, D, O, G, M, A – no excluded letters.  But ""DOGMA"" is obscure.
- ""FOCAL"" – C, A, L – L excluded.
- ""TONAL"" – L excluded.
- ""MONAL"" – L excluded.
- ""CONGA"" – C, O, N, G, A – no excluded letters.  O is in position 2 (allowed), ends with A.  C, N, G are allowed.

""CONGA"" seems valid:
- C O N G A
- Ends with A.
- O in position 2 (allowed).
- No R, S, E, L, H.

Let’s check if there’s a better common word.
- ""TONCA"" – not a valid word.
- ""PONGA"" – not valid.
- ""VOGUE"" – ends with E (excluded).
- ""COBIA"" – ends with A, O in 2, no excluded letters: C O B I A.  But I is allowed, B is allowed.  ""COBIA"" is valid.

Between ""CONGA"" and ""COBIA"", ""COBIA"" is slightly more common.

But let me think of another pattern: _ _ _ O A.
- Could be ""DOWNA"" – but W, N allowed, D allowed.  D O W N A – but O is in 4, A in 5.  No excluded letters.  Seems valid.
- ""MOUND"" – ends with D, not A.
- ""TWANG"" – ends with G, not A.
- ""BOGUS"" – ends with S (excluded).
- ""GONAD"" – ends with D.
- ""CLOAK"" – ends with K, but O in 3 (invalid).

""DOWNA"" seems valid:
- D O W N A
- Ends with A.
- O in position 2 (allowed).
- No excluded letters.

But ""DOWNA"" is less common.  ""COBIA"" is better.

Another: ""TONCA"" – invalid.
""BOGSA"" – S excluded.
""FOCAL"" – L excluded.

""COBIA"" seems the best available.

But wait – ""COBIA"" has I in position 4.  Is I allowed?  Yes, I is not excluded.

So my next guess is ""COBIA"".

Looking at valid English words: the only common word that fits C O _ O A is COCOA, but that would reuse C in position 1 and 4, which might not be allowed since letters in Wordle can repeat unless ruled out by feedback. However, in our case, the feedback only tells us about the positions of C, O, B, I, A. Since B and I are excluded, and C, O, A are confirmed in positions 1, 4, 5, the only remaining possibility is COCOA.

But let me double-check: is there any other word? COG OA, etc., are not valid. So COCOA seems to be the only valid word left.

However, COCOA is a valid 5-letter word (a type of drink), and it fits the pattern C O C O A. The letters used are C, O, C, O, A – none of which are excluded except possibly C and O being already confirmed. Since duplicates are allowed in Wordle, COCOA is a valid guess.

But wait – the feedback for guess 3 (cobia) showed:
C(✓) O(✓) B(x) I(x) A(✓)

This means:
- C is correct in position 1.
- O is correct in position 2.
- B is not in the word.
- I is not in the word.
- A is correct in position 5.

So the pattern is actually:
C O _ _ A

And we know from guess 2 (aloha) that O is in the word but NOT in position 3. From guess 3, we see that O is in position 2, so the third position is unknown but not O.

Also, from guess 1 and 2, we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, L, H, B, I.
- So the third and fourth positions must be filled from the remaining letters: D, F, G, K, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words C O _ _ A with no B, I, R, S, E, L, H:

Possible words:
- COGNA – not valid.
- CONGA – ends with A, but O is in position 2, so C O N G A – but we need to check if G and N are allowed. Yes, they are not excluded.
- CONGA fits: C O N G A – letters are C, O, N, G, A. None of the excluded letters (R, S, E, L, H, B, I) are present. This seems valid.

Is CONGA a valid word? Yes, it means to stomp or beat with boots, and it's in standard word lists.

Let me check if there's any other word. COY OA – invalid. COG OA – invalid. CONGA seems to be the only valid common word.

Therefore, the next guess should be CONGA.
