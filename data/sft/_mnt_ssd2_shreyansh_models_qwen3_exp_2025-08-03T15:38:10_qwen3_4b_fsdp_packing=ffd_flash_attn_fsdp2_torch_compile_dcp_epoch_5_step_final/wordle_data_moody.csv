1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess should have a mix of these letters to help identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 5 unique letters (A, R, O, S, E) which are all very common.
2. These letters cover vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S).
3. This will give us information about 5 different letters right away, which is optimal for the first guess.

This strategic choice should provide us with good feedback to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- O is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).
- A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ _ O _.
- We must avoid A, R, S, E entirely.
- We still need to test other common letters like T, N, I, L, C, D, etc.

A good next guess would test several new common consonants and vowels while maintaining the known O in the 4th position. ""TUNCO"" is a strong candidate because:
- It keeps O in the 4th spot.
- It introduces T, U, N, C (all common and none are excluded yet).
- It avoids the excluded letters A, R, S, E.

This maximizes information gain while respecting the constraints.

- O was - in tunco → O is in the word but not in position 4 (already satisfied since we have O fixed at 3).  

So the word has the pattern:

Remaining common letters not yet tested: D, F, G, H, I, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:

2. Contains M somewhere (positions 1, 2, or 4).  
3. Uses only letters not ruled out.

- HOMER (but E, R already ruled out)  
- WOMAN (but A, N ruled out)

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

A good first guess should have a mix of these letters to help identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 5 unique letters (A, R, O, S, E) which are all very common.
2. These letters cover vowels (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S).
3. This will give us information about 5 different letters right away, which is optimal for the first guess.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- O is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).
- A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ _ O _.
- We must avoid A, R, S, E entirely.
- We still need to test other common letters like T, N, I, L, C, D, etc.

A good next guess would test several new common consonants and vowels while maintaining the known O in the 4th position. ""TUNCO"" is a strong candidate because:
- It keeps O in the 4th spot.
- It introduces T, U, N, C (all common and none are excluded yet).
- It avoids the excluded letters A, R, S, E.

This maximizes information gain while respecting the constraints.

From the new feedback on ""tunco"":
- O is now marked as “-” (in the word but wrong position).  
  That means O is somewhere in the word, but NOT in the 4th position.  
- T, U, N, C are all absent.

So we now know:
- O is in the word, but not in position 4.  
- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, S, E, T, U, N, C.  
- We still need to test common letters like D, L, I, G, H, M, P, B, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Include O in a different position (1, 2, 3, or 5).  
2. Use only fresh letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
3. Be a common, valid 5-letter word.

“DOING” satisfies all of these:
- D, I, N, G are new letters (N was already ruled out, so scratch this).  
Let’s pick “BLOOM” instead:  
- B, L, M are new letters.  
- O appears twice, once in position 3 and once in position 5, testing two placements of O.

That gives us maximum new information.

Let’s summarize everything we know after the four guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):  
A, R, S, E, T, U, N, C, B, L, H

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or -):
- O is in position 2 (from hommy: O(✓) at position 2).  
- M is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from hommy: M(-) at 3 and 4).  
- Y is in the word and in position 5 (from hommy: Y(✓) at 5).

So the pattern is:
_ O _ _ Y

and the word must contain M exactly once, placed in position 1 or 2.  
But position 2 is already O, so M must be in position 1.

Therefore the word is:
M O _ _ Y

Remaining unused common letters (not yet ruled out):  
D, F, G, I, K, P, V, W, etc.

We need two letters for positions 3 and 4 from the allowed set.  
A common word that fits is “MODEL” but L is ruled out.  
“MOFFY” uses F twice and F is allowed.  
“MOKEY” uses K and E (E is ruled out).  
“MOGYD” is not a valid English word.  
“MOXIE” uses X and I, but E is ruled out.  
“MOVIE” uses V and I, but E is ruled out.  
“MOPPY” uses P twice and is valid.  
“MOXYY” is invalid.  

The simplest valid word is “MOFFY” (though F is repeated).  
Another valid option is “MOPPY”.  
Between these, “MOPPY” uses two new letters P and Y (Y already known at 5, but P is new).  

Let’s pick “MOPPY” as it introduces P and another O, but note O is already placed.

Wait, pattern is M O _ _ Y, so “M O P P Y” would fit.  
But P is new and valid.

Actually, let’s check “MOFFY” (M O F F Y) – F is new and valid.

Both are acceptable, but “MOFFY” is more common.  
So we’ll guess MOFFY.

- We still need to test common letters like D, L, I, G, H, M, P, B, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Include O in a different position (1, 2, 3, or 5).  
2. Use only fresh letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
3. Be a common, valid 5-letter word.

“DOING” satisfies all of these:
- D, I, N, G are new letters (N was already ruled out, so scratch this).  
Let’s pick “BLOOM” instead:  
- B, L, M are new letters.  
- O appears twice, once in position 3 and once in position 5, testing two placements of O.

That gives us maximum new information.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

From all feedback so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):  
A, R, S, E, T, U, N, C, B, L

Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown):  
O, M

Position clues:
- O was ✓ in position 3 in bloom → O is in the word and in position 3.  
- M was - in bloom → M is in the word but not in position 5.  
- O was - in tunco → O is in the word but not in position 4 (already satisfied since we have O fixed at 3).  

So the word has the pattern:
_ _ O _ _

and must also contain M somewhere other than position 5.

Remaining common letters not yet tested: D, F, G, H, I, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 3.  
2. Contains M somewhere (positions 1, 2, or 4).  
3. Uses only letters not ruled out.

Possible candidates:
- MOMMY (but Y is untested, and M is repeated)  
- HOMER (but E, R already ruled out)  
- WOMAN (but A, N ruled out)  
- FOCUS (but C, U, S ruled out)  

A clean choice is “HOMMY”:
- H, M, Y are new letters.  
- O is fixed at position 3.  
- M appears at position 4 (allowed, since M was only excluded from 5).  

This tests H and Y while satisfying all constraints.

Let’s summarize everything we know after the four guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):  
A, R, S, E, T, U, N, C, B, L, H

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or -):
- O is in position 2 (from hommy: O(✓) at position 2).  
- M is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from hommy: M(-) at 3 and 4).  
- Y is in the word and in position 5 (from hommy: Y(✓) at 5).

So the pattern is:
_ O _ _ Y

and the word must contain M exactly once, placed in position 1 or 2.  
But position 2 is already O, so M must be in position 1.

Therefore the word is:
M O _ _ Y

Remaining unused common letters (not yet ruled out):  
D, F, G, I, K, P, V, W, etc.

We need two letters for positions 3 and 4 from the allowed set.  
A common word that fits is “MODEL” but L is ruled out.  
“MOFFY” uses F twice and F is allowed.  
“MOKEY” uses K and E (E is ruled out).  
“MOGYD” is not a valid English word.  
“MOXIE” uses X and I, but E is ruled out.  
“MOVIE” uses V and I, but E is ruled out.  
“MOPPY” uses P twice and is valid.  
“MOXYY” is invalid.  

The simplest valid word is “MOFFY” (though F is repeated).  
Another valid option is “MOPPY”.  
Between these, “MOPPY” uses two new letters P and Y (Y already known at 5, but P is new).  

Let’s pick “MOPPY” as it introduces P and another O, but note O is already placed.

Wait, pattern is M O _ _ Y, so “M O P P Y” would fit.  
But P is new and valid.

Actually, let’s check “MOFFY” (M O F F Y) – F is new and valid.

Both are acceptable, but “MOFFY” is more common.  
So we’ll guess MOFFY.

From the feedback on mofty:
- M is correct in position 1 (✓)
- O is correct in position 2 (✓)
- Y is correct in position 5 (✓)
- F and T are not in the word (x)

So the pattern is now:
M O _ _ Y

Letters already ruled out (x): A, R, S, E, T, U, N, C, B, L, H, F

Remaining common letters for positions 3 and 4: D, G, I, K, P, V, W

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form M O ? ? Y.

Possible candidates:
- M O D D Y (invalid, D repeated)
- M O G G Y (invalid, G repeated)
- M O P P Y (invalid, P repeated)
- M O W W Y (invalid, W repeated)
- M O D G Y (valid word: MODGY? Not standard)
- M O G I Y (invalid)
- M O V I Y (invalid)
- M O D I Y (invalid)
- M O P I Y (invalid)
- M O V I Y (invalid)

Looking through standard words, the only valid word fitting M O _ _ Y with remaining letters is ""MOODY"" (M O D D Y), but it repeats D. However, ""MOODY"" is a valid English word.

Another possibility is ""MOXIE"" but X is allowed and I is allowed, but E is ruled out. 

Wait, let's check ""MOXYY"" - invalid. 

Actually, the valid word is ""MOODY"" even with the double D.

So we'll guess MOODY.
