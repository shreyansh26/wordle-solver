For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 common vowels and common consonants to maximize information gain. 

After considering options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S).
2. These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words.
3. It can quickly help identify which vowels are present and their positions.
4. The letters R and S are among the most common consonants in English.

This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
- DOES contain S, but NOT in position 4.
- We still need to test other common letters and positions.

Good next letters to test (since A, R, O, E are out) include T, L, N, I, C, U, D, H, etc. I want a word that:
1. Uses S in a different position (1, 2, 3, or 5).
2. Tests several new common consonants and vowels.
3. Avoids any already-eliminated letters.

""STUNT"" is a strong candidate:
- S is moved to position 1.
- T, U, N are all new common letters.
- It tests 3 new vowels (U) and 2 new consonants (T, N) while re-using S in a new spot.

From the new feedback on STUNT:
- S is now in the correct first position (✓).
- T appears in the correct third position (✓).
- T also appears in the correct fifth position (✓).
- U and N are NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
- The word starts with S and has T in positions 3 and 5.
- The letters A, R, O, E, U, N are out.
- We still need to test consonants and vowels for positions 2 and 4.

Letters left to test (common ones): I, C, L, D, H, M, P, Y, etc.

I want a word that:
1. Keeps S _ T _ T (positions 1, 3, 5 are locked).
2. Tests a vowel for position 2 (possible: I, Y).
3. Tests a consonant for position 4 (possible: C, L, D, H, M, P).

Possible candidates:
- SITTY (but Y might be too similar to T)
- SPLIT (but P and L are good, but we already know T is correct)
- SCOOT (but O is out)
- SHIRT (but H is good, R is out)
- SLIT (but needs 5 letters)
- SIGHT (but H is good, G is untested)

""SPLIT"" seems good:
- S P L I T
- Tests P (position 2), L (position 4), and I (position 2).
- But T is already confirmed at position 5, so this would test P and L.

Wait, let me think better: the word structure is S _ T _ T. So position 4 is the only unknown between the two Ts.

So we need a word like S _ T _ T. Possible words:
- SITTT (invalid)
- SPLIT (P L I T - but this would be S P L I T, which is S _ T _ T with T at 5)
- SCATT (but double T might not be the case)
- SHIRT (H I R T - but R is out)
- SKITT (K is possible, but not common)
- SLITT (double L is possible but rare)
- SWITT (W is possible)

""SPLIT"" seems the most common word fitting S _ T _ T, testing P and L.

But let me check if SPLIT is valid: yes, it's a word (a type of crack).

However, another valid word is ""SITTY"" but Y is less likely between Ts.

Another option is ""SKITT"" but K is less common.

""SHIRT"" is invalid because R is out.

""SLIT"" is 4 letters.

""SWIFT"" has I and F, but F is less common.

""STILT"" has I and L, but T is already at 5.

Actually, ""STILT"" is S T I L T - but T is already at position 3, so this would conflict.

Wait, the structure is S _ T _ T, so positions: S (1), _ (2), T (3), _ (4), T (5).

So possible words:
- SITTT (invalid)
- SPLIT (S P L I T - but this would be S P L I T, which is S _ T _ T with T at 5)
- SCATT (S C A T T - but A is out)
- SHATT (H is possible, but A is out)
- SKITT (K is possible)
- SLATT (L is possible)
- SWATT (W is possible)

""SPLIT"" seems the best among these, testing P and L.

But let me think of another word: ""STILT"" is actually S T I L T, which would be S T I L T - but this has T at 3 and 5, which matches our feedback (T at 3 and 5 are correct).

But ""STILT"" is a valid word meaning a small bridge or a type of dance.

This seems better because it tests I and L in positions 2 and 4.

So ""STILT"" is S T I L T, which fits S _ T _ T.

But wait, in STUNT the T at position 3 was correct, and the T at position 5 was correct, so the word has T at positions 3 and 5. So the word is S _ T _ T.

Possible words:
- STILT (S T I L T)
- STINT (but N is out)
- STILT seems the only common word left.

But let me check if there are others:
- SPLIT (S P L I T) - but this would be S P L I T, which is S _ T _ T with T at 5, but L is at 4 and I at 2.

Actually, ""SPLIT"" is S P L I T - positions: S(1), P(2), L(3), I(4), T(5). But this would have T at 5, but L at 3, which contradicts our feedback that T is at 3 and 5. So SPLIT is invalid because T must be at 3 and 5, so the word must be S _ T _ T.

Thus, possible words:
- STILT (S T I L T)
- STINT (N is out)
- STILT is the only valid word left.

But let me think if there are others:
- SATTY (but A and Y issues)
- SKITT (K is possible)
- SWIFT (but F is possible)

Actually, ""STILT"" is the most plausible word fitting S _ T _ T, testing I and L.

But let me verify:
- STILT: S(1) T(2) I(3) L(4) T(5)
- From STUNT feedback: T is correct at positions 3 and 5, so T must be at 3 and 5. Thus, the word must be S _ T _ T.

So the word is S _ T _ T, with T at 3 and 5. Possible letters for position 2 and 4: excluding A, R, O, E, U, N.

Possible letters for position 2: I, Y, C, L, D, H, M, P, etc.
Possible letters for position 4: same list.

Possible words:
- SITTT (invalid)
- SPLIT (but L is at 3, which must be T)
- Actually, the word must be S _ T _ T, so:
  - S I T _ T: possible words: SITCT, SITDT, SITFT, SITGT, SITH T, SITLT, etc. None common.
  - S _ T I T: possible words: S C T I T (invalid), S P T I T (invalid), S H T I T (invalid), etc.
  - S _ T _ T with other letters: S C T C T (invalid), S P T C T (invalid), etc.

Wait, let me think differently: the word has T at positions 3 and 5, so it's S _ T _ T. The only common word I can think of is ""STILT"" (S T I L T), which has T at 2 and 5, but this contradicts our feedback that T is at 3 and 5.

Actually, the feedback from STUNT shows:
- S(✓) at position 1
- T(✓) at position 2
- U(x) at position 3
- N(x) at position 4
- T(✓) at position 5

Wait, this changes things! The feedback for STUNT is:
- Position 1: S(✓) - correct
- Position 2: T(✓) - correct
- Position 3: U(x) - not in word
- Position 4: N(x) - not in word
- Position 5: T(✓) - correct

So the word is S T _ _ T (positions 1, 2, 5 are locked as S, T, T respectively), and positions 3 and 4 are unknown, with letters not in {A, R, O, E, U, N}.

Letters left to test for positions 3 and 4: common ones include I, C, L, D, H, M, P, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- S T I L T (STILT)
- S T I C T (STICT - invalid)
- S T I D T (STIDT - invalid)
- S T I M T (STIMT - invalid)
- S T I P T (STIPT - invalid)
- S T I Y T (STIYT - invalid)
- S T C L T (STCLT - invalid)
- S T C I T (STCIT - invalid)
- S T L I T (STLIT - invalid)
- S T L C T (STLCT - invalid)
- S T L D T (STLDT - invalid)
- S T L I T (STLIT - invalid)
- S T L P T (STLPT - invalid)
- S T L Y T (STLYT - invalid)
- S T P I T (STPI T - invalid)
- S T P L T (STPLT - invalid)

- S T Y C T (STYCT - invalid)
- S T Y L T (STYLT - invalid)
- S T Y P T (STYPT - invalid)
- S T Y M T (STYMT - invalid)

The only valid English word fitting S T _ _ T is ""STILT"" (S T I L T), which uses I and L in positions 3 and 4.

Thus, the next guess should be STILT.

From the feedback:
- S is correct in position 1.
- T is correct in position 2 and position 5.
- Positions 3 and 4 are unknown, and letters A, R, O, E, U, N are out.

- SPLIT (P L I T - but this would be S P L I T, which is S _ T _ T with T at 5)
- SCATT (but double T might not be the case)
- SHIRT (H I R T - but R is out)
- SKITT (K is possible, but not common)
- SLITT (double L is possible but rare)
- SWITT (W is possible)

""SPLIT"" seems the most common word fitting S _ T _ T, testing P and L.

But let me check if SPLIT is valid: yes, it's a word (a type of crack).

However, another valid word is ""SITTY"" but Y is less likely between Ts.

Another option is ""SKITT"" but K is less common.

""SHIRT"" is invalid because R is out.

""SLIT"" is 4 letters.

""SWIFT"" has I and F, but F is less common.

""STILT"" has I and L, but T is already at 5.

Actually, ""STILT"" is S T I L T - but T is already at position 3, so this would conflict.

Wait, the structure is S _ T _ T, so positions: S (1), _ (2), T (3), _ (4), T (5).

So possible words:
- SITTT (invalid)
- SPLIT (S P L I T - but this would be S P L I T, which is S _ T _ T with T at 5)
- SCATT (S C A T T - but A is out)
- SHATT (H is possible, but A is out)
- SKITT (K is possible)
- SLATT (L is possible)
- SWATT (W is possible)

""SPLIT"" seems the best among these, testing P and L.

But let me think of another word: ""STILT"" is actually S T I L T, which would be S T I L T - but this has T at 3 and 5, which matches our feedback (T at 3 and 5 are correct).

But ""STILT"" is a valid word meaning a small bridge or a type of dance.

This seems better because it tests I and L in positions 2 and 4.

So ""STILT"" is S T I L T, which fits S _ T _ T.

But wait, in STUNT the T at position 3 was correct, and the T at position 5 was correct, so the word has T at positions 3 and 5. So the word is S _ T _ T.

Possible words:
- STILT (S T I L T)
- STINT (but N is out)
- STILT seems the only common word left.

But let me check if there are others:
- SPLIT (S P L I T) - but this would be S P L I T, which is S _ T _ T with T at 5, but L is at 4 and I at 2.

Actually, ""SPLIT"" is S P L I T - positions: S(1), P(2), L(3), I(4), T(5). But this would have T at 5, but L at 3, which contradicts our feedback that T is at 3 and 5. So SPLIT is invalid because T must be at 3 and 5, so the word must be S _ T _ T.

Thus, possible words:
- STILT (S T I L T)
- STINT (N is out)
- STILT is the only valid word left.

But let me think if there are others:
- SATTY (but A and Y issues)
- SKITT (K is possible)
- SWIFT (but F is possible)

Actually, ""STILT"" is the most plausible word fitting S _ T _ T, testing I and L.

But let me verify:
- STILT: S(1) T(2) I(3) L(4) T(5)
- From STUNT feedback: T is correct at positions 3 and 5, so T must be at 3 and 5. Thus, the word must be S _ T _ T.

So the word is S _ T _ T, with T at 3 and 5. Possible letters for position 2 and 4: excluding A, R, O, E, U, N.

Possible letters for position 2: I, Y, C, L, D, H, M, P, etc.
Possible letters for position 4: same list.

Possible words:
- SITTT (invalid)
- SPLIT (but L is at 3, which must be T)
- Actually, the word must be S _ T _ T, so:
  - S I T _ T: possible words: SITCT, SITDT, SITFT, SITGT, SITH T, SITLT, etc. None common.
  - S _ T I T: possible words: S C T I T (invalid), S P T I T (invalid), S H T I T (invalid), etc.
  - S _ T _ T with other letters: S C T C T (invalid), S P T C T (invalid), etc.

Wait, let me think differently: the word has T at positions 3 and 5, so it's S _ T _ T. The only common word I can think of is ""STILT"" (S T I L T), which has T at 2 and 5, but this contradicts our feedback that T is at 3 and 5.

Actually, the feedback from STUNT shows:
- S(✓) at position 1
- T(✓) at position 2
- U(x) at position 3
- N(x) at position 4
- T(✓) at position 5

Wait, this changes things! The feedback for STUNT is:
- Position 1: S(✓) - correct
- Position 2: T(✓) - correct
- Position 3: U(x) - not in word
- Position 4: N(x) - not in word
- Position 5: T(✓) - correct

So the word is S T _ _ T (positions 1, 2, 5 are locked as S, T, T respectively), and positions 3 and 4 are unknown, with letters not in {A, R, O, E, U, N}.

Letters left to test for positions 3 and 4: common ones include I, C, L, D, H, M, P, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- S T I L T (STILT)
- S T I C T (STICT - invalid)
- S T I D T (STIDT - invalid)
- S T I M T (STIMT - invalid)
- S T I P T (STIPT - invalid)
- S T I Y T (STIYT - invalid)
- S T C L T (STCLT - invalid)
- S T C I T (STCIT - invalid)
- S T L I T (STLIT - invalid)
- S T L C T (STLCT - invalid)
- S T L D T (STLDT - invalid)
- S T L I T (STLIT - invalid)
- S T L P T (STLPT - invalid)
- S T L Y T (STLYT - invalid)
- S T P I T (STPI T - invalid)
- S T P L T (STPLT - invalid)
- S T P C T (STPCT - invalid)
- S T D I T (STDIT - invalid)
- S T D L T (STDLT - invalid)
- S T D C T (STDCT - invalid)
- S T D P T (STDPT - invalid)
- S T D Y T (STDYT - invalid)
- S T M I T (STMIT - invalid)
- S T M C T (STMCT - invalid)
- S T M L T (STMLT - invalid)
- S T M P T (STMPT - invalid)
- S T M Y T (STMYT - invalid)
- S T Y I T (STYIT - invalid)
- S T Y C T (STYCT - invalid)
- S T Y L T (STYLT - invalid)
- S T Y P T (STYPT - invalid)
- S T Y M T (STYMT - invalid)

The only valid English word fitting S T _ _ T is ""STILT"" (S T I L T), which uses I and L in positions 3 and 4.

Thus, the next guess should be STILT.From the feedback:
- S is correct in position 1.
- T is correct in position 2 and position 5.
- Positions 3 and 4 are unknown, and letters A, R, O, E, U, N are out.
- The word must be S T _ _ T.

The only valid 5-letter English word fitting this pattern is:",Guess 3: STILT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) I(✓) L(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
