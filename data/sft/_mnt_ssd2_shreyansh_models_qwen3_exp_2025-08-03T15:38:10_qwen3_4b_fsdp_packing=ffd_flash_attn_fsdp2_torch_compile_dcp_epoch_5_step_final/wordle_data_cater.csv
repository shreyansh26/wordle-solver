Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words
2. Contains a good mix of vowels and consonants
3. Avoids repeating letters to maximize information gain

Common starting words often include letters like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc. After considering these, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it:
- Contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels quickly
- Uses very common consonants (R, S)
- Has no repeating letters
- Is a valid English word

This should give me good coverage of common letters and positions to narrow down possibilities effectively.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- Doesn’t place A in position 1, R in position 2, or E in position 5

- E in position 1 (new position)
- A in position 2 (new position)
- R in position 3 (new position)
- L and Y as new letters

This seems like a strong next guess to gather more positional information.

- E can be in 3, 4, or 5 (but not 1 or 5 → 3 or 4)
- R can be in 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2 or 3)

Let’s try placing E in 3 and R in 5: _ A E _ R
We need two consonants for positions 1 and 4. Common choices: T, N, D, C, etc.

“TAPER” comes to mind:
- T (new consonant)
- A (fixed in position 2)
- E (position 3)
- P (new consonant)
- R (position 5)

Check constraints:
- Contains A, E, R exactly once each.
- No O, S, L, Y.
- A is in position 2 (✓).
- E is in position 3 (allowed).
- R is in position 5 (allowed).
- T and P are new letters.

This seems like a good next guess.

From the new feedback on TAPER:

- T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 1
- A(✓) → A is confirmed in position 2
- P(x) → P is not in the word
- E(✓) → E is confirmed in position 4
- R(✓) → R is confirmed in position 5

So the pattern is now: _ A _ E R

Letters we know are in the word: A, E, R, T  
Letters ruled out: O, S, L, Y, P

Positions fixed:
- Position 2 = A
- Position 4 = E
- Position 5 = R

T must appear somewhere, but not in position 1 (from T(-)). The only remaining spot for T is position 3.  
Therefore the word must be: _ A T E R

The only common 5-letter word that fits this pattern is “MATER” (short for material), but “MATER” is valid. However, let’s check if there’s a more common word. Actually, “HATER” is also valid, but “MATER” is more likely.

But wait—let’s verify:
- MATER: M, A, T, E, R → fits _ A T E R pattern
- HATER: H, A, T, E, R → also fits

Between these, “MATER” is more common in word lists. However, let me double-check if there are any others. “FATER” isn’t a word, “WATER” isn’t valid (double A), etc. So “MATER” is the best fit.

But actually, “MATER” is valid, but let me reconsider: the word must be _ A T E R. The only common English word fitting this is “MATER” (as in materiel) or “HATER”. Between these, “MATER” is more likely.

However, I just realized that “MATER” is actually a valid word (plural of mater), but let me check a word list—“MATER” is listed. But let me think if there’s a more common word. Actually, “MATER” is correct.

But wait—let me re-examine: the word must be _ A T E R. The only common English word is “MATER”. However, let me check another possibility: “CATER” comes to mind, but C is not yet tested. But we know the pattern is _ A T E R, so “CATER” would fit, but we haven’t tested C yet. However, the pattern is fixed as _ A T E R, so the first letter must be a new consonant.

Looking at the pattern _ A T E R, the first letter must be a consonant not yet used. Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Common words fitting _ A T E R:
- CATER
- HATER
- MATER

Among these, “CATER” is the most common. Let me verify:
- CATER: C, A, T, E, R → fits all constraints
- C is new, not yet tested
- No ruled-out letters

Therefore, “CATER” is the best next guess.

The feedback from TAPER tells us:
- A is fixed in position 2
- E is fixed in position 4
- R is fixed in position 5
- T must be in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in position 3
- P is not in the word
- Letters ruled out: O, S, L, Y, P

This leaves the pattern: _ A T E R
