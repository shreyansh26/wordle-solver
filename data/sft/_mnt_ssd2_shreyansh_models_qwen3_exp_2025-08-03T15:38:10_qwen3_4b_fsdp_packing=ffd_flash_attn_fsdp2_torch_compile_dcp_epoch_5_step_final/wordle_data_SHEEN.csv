### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should use some of these letters to quickly identify which are in the word and their positions.

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", etc., I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage across different positions. This should help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

- Contains S and E, but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

We need a 5-letter word that includes S and E, avoids A, R, O, and has S not in position 4 and E not in position 5.

From the new feedback on STEIN:
- S is now known to be in position 1 (✓).
- E is now known to be in position 3 (✓).
- N is now known to be in position 5 (✓).
- T and I are NOT in the word (x).

So the secret word looks like: S _ E _ N

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I.

We still need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters that haven't been ruled out. Available letters (excluding A, R, O, T, I) include: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit S _ E _ N:
- S C E N ? – but we need 5 letters, so SCEN_ doesn’t fit.
- S H E E N – but E is already in position 3, so double E isn’t helpful.
- S L E E N – same issue.
- S P E E N – same.
- S C E N T – but T is out.
- S H E N ? – need 5 letters.
- S L E N ? – need 5 letters.

Wait, let me list possible combinations:
- Position 2: possible letters B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 4: same list

Possible words:
- S C E N ? – SCEN_ – no valid word.
- S H E N ? – SHE_N – but N is already at 5, so SHE_N doesn’t fit.
- S L E N ? – SLEN_ – no.
- S P E N ? – SPEN_ – no.
- S C E N T – but T is out.
- S H E E N – but E is already at 3, and we can’t have E at 4.
- S C E N D – SCEND – but D is allowed.
- S C E N D – SCEND is a valid word (archaic past tense of ""succeed"", but acceptable in word lists).

But let me think of more common words:
- S C E N T – T is out.
- S H E N D – HEND? No.
- S P E C N – no.
- S C E N D – SCEND is valid.
- S L E D N – no.
- S P E L N – no.

Another approach: look for words like S _ E _ N with common letters.
- S C E N D – SCEND
- S H E N ? – no valid word.
- S L E N ? – no.
- S P E N ? – no.
- S W E N ? – no.

Wait, let me check ""SLEPT"" but T is out.
""SPEEN"" – but E is already at 3, and we can't have E at 4.

Actually, ""S C E N D"" seems to be the only valid word fitting S _ E _ N with allowed letters.

But let me think again: maybe ""S C E N D"" is acceptable even if archaic.

Alternatively, ""S C E N D"" is valid in many word lists.

So the guess is: SCEND

But let me check if there's a more common word: ""S C E N D"" is actually valid (archaic past of ""succeed"").

However, to maximize common letters, maybe ""S C E N D"" is the best fit.

But let me think of ""S C E N D"" as a valid guess.

Alternatively, ""S C E N D"" is acceptable.

So the next guess is SCEND.

Based on the feedback:
- S is fixed in position 1
- E is fixed in position 3
- N is fixed in position 5
- T and I are not in the word
- A, R, O were already ruled out

The word structure is S _ E _ N. The missing letters (positions 2 and 4) must come from the remaining alphabet (excluding A, R, O, T, I).

A valid word that fits this pattern is ""SCEND"" (archaic past tense of ""succeed"").

- T and I are NOT in the word (x).

So the secret word looks like: S _ E _ N

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I.

We still need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters that haven't been ruled out. Available letters (excluding A, R, O, T, I) include: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit S _ E _ N:
- S C E N ? – but we need 5 letters, so SCEN_ doesn’t fit.
- S H E E N – but E is already in position 3, so double E isn’t helpful.
- S L E E N – same issue.
- S P E E N – same.
- S C E N T – but T is out.
- S H E N ? – need 5 letters.
- S L E N ? – need 5 letters.

Wait, let me list possible combinations:
- Position 2: possible letters B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 4: same list

Possible words:
- S C E N ? – SCEN_ – no valid word.
- S H E N ? – SHE_N – but N is already at 5, so SHE_N doesn’t fit.
- S L E N ? – SLEN_ – no.
- S P E N ? – SPEN_ – no.
- S C E N T – but T is out.
- S H E E N – but E is already at 3, and we can’t have E at 4.
- S C E N D – SCEND – but D is allowed.
- S C E N D – SCEND is a valid word (archaic past tense of ""succeed"", but acceptable in word lists).

But let me think of more common words:
- S C E N T – T is out.
- S H E N D – HEND? No.
- S P E C N – no.
- S C E N D – SCEND is valid.
- S L E D N – no.
- S P E L N – no.

Another approach: look for words like S _ E _ N with common letters.
- S C E N D – SCEND
- S H E N ? – no valid word.
- S L E N ? – no.
- S P E N ? – no.
- S W E N ? – no.

Wait, let me check ""SLEPT"" but T is out.
""SPEEN"" – but E is already at 3, and we can't have E at 4.

Actually, ""S C E N D"" seems to be the only valid word fitting S _ E _ N with allowed letters.

But let me think again: maybe ""S C E N D"" is acceptable even if archaic.

Alternatively, ""S C E N D"" is valid in many word lists.

So the guess is: SCEND

But let me check if there's a more common word: ""S C E N D"" is actually valid (archaic past of ""succeed"").

However, to maximize common letters, maybe ""S C E N D"" is the best fit.

But let me think of ""S C E N D"" as a valid guess.

Alternatively, ""S C E N D"" is acceptable.

So the next guess is SCEND.Based on the feedback:
- S is fixed in position 1
- E is fixed in position 3
- N is fixed in position 5
- T and I are not in the word
- A, R, O were already ruled out

The word structure is S _ E _ N. The missing letters (positions 2 and 4) must come from the remaining alphabet (excluding A, R, O, T, I).

A valid word that fits this pattern is ""SCEND"" (archaic past tense of ""succeed"").

From the latest feedback on SCEND:
- S is still correct in position 1 (✓)
- E is still correct in position 3 (✓)
- N is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-) — so N must be in position 2 or 4
- C and D are NOT in the word (x)

Current known pattern: S _ E _ _  (with N somewhere in the last two positions)

Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, T, I, C, D

Therefore the word must be S N E _ _ or S _ E N _

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit:
- S N E _ _ : “SNEER” (but R is out), “SNEAK” (A is out), “SNEED” (D is out) — no valid options.
- S _ E N _ : “SPEEN” (double E not helpful), “SHEEN” (H is allowed), “SLEEN” (L is allowed), “SWEEP” (W and P are allowed), “SLEPT” (T is out), “SPEEN” (P is allowed).

The most promising valid word that fits all constraints is “SHEEN”:
- S(✓) H(?) E(✓) E(?) N(✓) — positions 1,3,5 are correct; position 2 and 4 are new letters (H and E) that haven’t been ruled out.

Let’s verify:
- H is not ruled out (not in any previous x list)
- Second E is allowed (no restriction on duplicate letters)

Thus, “SHEEN” is a valid next guess.
