### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE"" are popular choices for this reason. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the two previous guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
2. TREND → T(x) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(-)

What we now know for sure:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, N
- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): R, E, D
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from AROSE and TREND)
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (from AROSE and TREND)
- D is in the word but NOT in position 5 (from TREND)

So the secret word contains R, E, D and none of A, O, S, T, N.

We need to place R, E, D in positions 1-5, ensuring:
- R is not in 2 or 3
- E is not in 4 or 5
- D is not in 5

Remaining common letters we haven't used yet: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

Let's try to construct a word that uses R, E, D plus two new letters while respecting the positional constraints.

One promising pattern is to place D in position 1 (since it can't be in 5), R in 4 or 5 (but can't be in 3), and E must go in 1 or 2 or 3 (but can't be in 4 or 5).

Let's try:
- D in 1
- E in 2
- R in 4
That leaves positions 3 and 5 to fill with new letters.

A common word that fits is ""D E _ R _"". Let's think of common letters for positions 3 and 5. Let's try L and C: ""DE LRC"" - but that's not a word. How about ""DECRY""? But that has C and Y, and R is in position 4 which is allowed, E in 2 which is allowed, D in 1 which is allowed. Let's check:
- D in 1: allowed
- E in 2: allowed
- R in 4: allowed
- C and Y are new letters not yet tested
- ""DECRY"" is a valid 5-letter word

This seems like a good next guess.

From the three previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, N, C, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word (positions still unknown): R, E, D  
Exact position exclusions:
- R cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from AROSE, TREND, DECRY)  
- E cannot be in positions 4, 5, or 2 (from AROSE, TREND, DECRY)  
- D cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (from TREND, DECRY)

So:
- R must be in position 1 or 5
- E must be in position 1, 3, or 4
- D must be in position 2, 3, or 4

We need a 5-letter word that uses exactly the letters R, E, D plus two new letters (from the remaining alphabet: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z).

Let’s try to place the known letters first:

Option 1: R in position 1  
Then E must go in 3 or 4, and D must go in 2, 3, or 4 (but not conflicting with E).

Sub-option 1: R _ _ _ _  
   - E in 3: R _ E _ _  
     D must be in 2 or 4.  
     - D in 2: R D E _ _ → need two new letters for positions 4,5  
     - D in 4: R E D _ _ → need two new letters for positions 2,5  

Sub-option 2: R _ _ _ _  
   - E in 4: R _ _ E _  
     D must be in 2 or 3.

Let’s look for real words:

- R D E _ _ : “RDE__” – no common words  
- R _ E _ _ : “R_E__” – e.g., “RIBLE” (not valid), “RIPER” (but P and second R already used)  
- R _ _ E _ : “R__E_” – e.g., “RIGEL” (but G and L are new) – check if valid: “RIGEL” is a valid word (a star name)

Wait, let’s verify:
- R I G E L: letters are R, I, G, E, L  
   - R in 1: allowed (positions 1 or 5)  
   - E in 4: allowed (positions 1,3,4)  
   - D is missing – we need D somewhere. So this is invalid.

We must include D, R, E.

Try:
R _ _ _ _ with D in 2 and E in 3: R D E _ _ – no valid word  
R _ _ _ _ with D in 4 and E in 3: R _ E D _ – need letter in 2 and 5  
   - R I E D _ – “RIED_” – “RIEDS” (but S is out), “RIEDH” (invalid)  
No valid word.

Option 2: R in position 5  
Then:
- E must be in 1, 3, or 4  
- D must be in 2, 3, or 4  

Sub-option 1: _ _ _ _ R  
   - E in 1: E _ _ _ R  
     D must be in 2, 3, or 4  
     - D in 2: E D _ _ R – need two new letters for 3,4  
     - D in 3: E _ D _ R – need two new letters for 2,4  
     - D in 4: E _ _ D R – need two new letters for 2,3  

Sub-option 2: _ _ _ _ R  
   - E in 3: _ _ E _ R  
     D must be in 2 or 4  
Sub-option 3: _ _ _ _ R  
   - E in 4: _ _ _ E R  
     D must be in 2 or 3  

Let’s look for valid words:

- E D _ _ R: “EDD__” – no  
- E _ D _ R: “E D _ _ R” – “EIDER” (but I and second D are new) – check letters: E, I, D, E, R – uses D, E, R and new I, but has double E. The word “EIDER” is valid (a type of duck).  
  - E(1): allowed  
  - I(2): new letter  
  - D(3): allowed  
  - E(4): allowed  
  - R(5): allowed  

This seems valid and uses all required letters.

Another candidate:  
E _ _ D R – “E _ _ D R” – “EJECT” (but J and C are new, but C is out) – invalid.  
“EJECT” has C which is out.  
“ELEDR” – invalid.  

“EIDER” seems the best fit.

Let me double-check constraints:
- Letters used: E, I, D, E, R – all allowed, no forbidden letters (A,O,S,T,N,C,Y)  
- R is in 5: allowed (positions 1 or 5)  
- E is in 1 and 4: allowed (positions 1,3,4)  
- D is in 3: allowed (positions 2,3,4)  

This satisfies every constraint.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE"" are popular choices for this reason. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains R and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A, O, S
- Must be 5 letters

I need a word that uses R and E, avoids A, O, S, and places R and E in different spots than before. Good letters to try next might be T, N, L, C, H, etc.

A good candidate is ""TREND"":
- Uses R and E
- Avoids A, O, S
- R is in position 3 (not 2)
- E is in position 4 (not 5)
- Adds T, N, D which are common and haven't been tested

Guess 2: TREND -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
2. TREND → T(x) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(-)

What we now know for sure:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, N
- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): R, E, D
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from AROSE and TREND)
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (from AROSE and TREND)
- D is in the word but NOT in position 5 (from TREND)

So the secret word contains R, E, D and none of A, O, S, T, N.

We need to place R, E, D in positions 1-5, ensuring:
- R is not in 2 or 3
- E is not in 4 or 5
- D is not in 5

Remaining common letters we haven't used yet: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

Let's try to construct a word that uses R, E, D plus two new letters while respecting the positional constraints.

One promising pattern is to place D in position 1 (since it can't be in 5), R in 4 or 5 (but can't be in 3), and E must go in 1 or 2 or 3 (but can't be in 4 or 5).

Let's try:
- D in 1
- E in 2
- R in 4
That leaves positions 3 and 5 to fill with new letters.

A common word that fits is ""D E _ R _"". Let's think of common letters for positions 3 and 5. Let's try L and C: ""DE LRC"" - but that's not a word. How about ""DECRY""? But that has C and Y, and R is in position 4 which is allowed, E in 2 which is allowed, D in 1 which is allowed. Let's check:
- D in 1: allowed
- E in 2: allowed
- R in 4: allowed
- C and Y are new letters not yet tested
- ""DECRY"" is a valid 5-letter word

This seems like a good next guess.

- E cannot be in positions 4, 5, or 2 (from AROSE, TREND, DECRY)  
- D cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (from TREND, DECRY)

So:
- R must be in position 1 or 5
- E must be in position 1, 3, or 4
- D must be in position 2, 3, or 4

We need a 5-letter word that uses exactly the letters R, E, D plus two new letters (from the remaining alphabet: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z).

Let’s try to place the known letters first:

Option 1: R in position 1  
Then E must go in 3 or 4, and D must go in 2, 3, or 4 (but not conflicting with E).

Sub-option 2: R _ _ _ _  
   - E in 4: R _ _ E _

- R D E _ _ : “RDE__” – no common words  
- R _ E _ _ : “R_E__” – e.g., “RIBLE” (not valid), “RIPER” (but P and second R already used)  
- R _ _ E _ : “R__E_” – e.g., “RIGEL” (but G and L are new) – check if valid: “RIGEL” is a valid word (a star name)

Wait, let’s verify:
- R I G E L: letters are R, I, G, E, L  
   - R in 1: allowed (positions 1 or 5)  
   - E in 4: allowed (positions 1,3,4)  
   - D is missing – we need D somewhere. So this is invalid.

We must include D, R, E.

Try:
R _ _ _ _ with D in 2 and E in 3: R D E _ _ – no valid word  
R _ _ _ _ with D in 4 and E in 3: R _ E D _ – need letter in 2 and 5  
   - R I E D _ – “RIED_” – “RIEDS” (but S is out), “RIEDH” (invalid)  
No valid word.

Option 2: R in position 5  
Then:
- E must be in 1, 3, or 4  
- D must be in 2, 3, or 4  

Sub-option 1: _ _ _ _ R  
   - E in 1: E _ _ _ R  
     D must be in 2, 3, or 4  
     - D in 2: E D _ _ R – need two new letters for 3,4  
     - D in 3: E _ D _ R – need two new letters for 2,4  
     - D in 4: E _ _ D R – need two new letters for 2,3  

Sub-option 2: _ _ _ _ R  
   - E in 3: _ _ E _ R  
     D must be in 2 or 4  
Sub-option 3: _ _ _ _ R  
   - E in 4: _ _ _ E R  
     D must be in 2 or 3  

Let’s look for valid words:

- E D _ _ R: “EDD__” – no  
- E _ D _ R: “E D _ _ R” – “EIDER” (but I and second D are new) – check letters: E, I, D, E, R – uses D, E, R and new I, but has double E. The word “EIDER” is valid (a type of duck).  
  - E(1): allowed  
  - I(2): new letter  
  - D(3): allowed  
  - E(4): allowed  
  - R(5): allowed  

This seems valid and uses all required letters.

Another candidate:  
E _ _ D R – “E _ _ D R” – “EJECT” (but J and C are new, but C is out) – invalid.  
“EJECT” has C which is out.  
“ELEDR” – invalid.  

“EIDER” seems the best fit.

Let me double-check constraints:
- Letters used: E, I, D, E, R – all allowed, no forbidden letters (A,O,S,T,N,C,Y)  
- R is in 5: allowed (positions 1 or 5)  
- E is in 1 and 4: allowed (positions 1,3,4)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE"" are popular choices for this reason. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains R and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A, O, S
- Must be 5 letters

I need a word that uses R and E, avoids A, O, S, and places R and E in different spots than before. Good letters to try next might be T, N, L, C, H, etc.

A good candidate is ""TREND"":
- Uses R and E
- Avoids A, O, S
- R is in position 3 (not 2)
- E is in position 4 (not 5)
- Adds T, N, D which are common and haven't been tested

Guess 2: TREND -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
2. TREND → T(x) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(-)

What we now know for sure:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, N
- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): R, E, D
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from AROSE and TREND)
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (from AROSE and TREND)
- D is in the word but NOT in position 5 (from TREND)

So the secret word contains R, E, D and none of A, O, S, T, N.

We need to place R, E, D in positions 1-5, ensuring:
- R is not in 2 or 3
- E is not in 4 or 5
- D is not in 5

Remaining common letters we haven't used yet: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

Let's try to construct a word that uses R, E, D plus two new letters while respecting the positional constraints.

One promising pattern is to place D in position 1 (since it can't be in 5), R in 4 or 5 (but can't be in 3), and E must go in 1 or 2 or 3 (but can't be in 4 or 5).

Let's try:
- D in 1
- E in 2
- R in 4
That leaves positions 3 and 5 to fill with new letters.

A common word that fits is ""D E _ R _"". Let's think of common letters for positions 3 and 5. Let's try L and C: ""DE LRC"" - but that's not a word. How about ""DECRY""? But that has C and Y, and R is in position 4 which is allowed, E in 2 which is allowed, D in 1 which is allowed. Let's check:
- D in 1: allowed
- E in 2: allowed
- R in 4: allowed
- C and Y are new letters not yet tested
- ""DECRY"" is a valid 5-letter word

This seems like a good next guess.

From the three previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, N, C, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word (positions still unknown): R, E, D  
Exact position exclusions:
- R cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from AROSE, TREND, DECRY)  
- E cannot be in positions 4, 5, or 2 (from AROSE, TREND, DECRY)  
- D cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (from TREND, DECRY)

So:
- R must be in position 1 or 5
- E must be in position 1, 3, or 4
- D must be in position 2, 3, or 4

We need a 5-letter word that uses exactly the letters R, E, D plus two new letters (from the remaining alphabet: B, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z).

Let’s try to place the known letters first:

Option 1: R in position 1  
Then E must go in 3 or 4, and D must go in 2, 3, or 4 (but not conflicting with E).

Sub-option 1: R _ _ _ _  
   - E in 3: R _ E _ _  
     D must be in 2 or 4.  
     - D in 2: R D E _ _ → need two new letters for positions 4,5  
     - D in 4: R E D _ _ → need two new letters for positions 2,5  

Sub-option 2: R _ _ _ _  
   - E in 4: R _ _ E _  
     D must be in 2 or 3.

Let’s look for real words:

- R D E _ _ : “RDE__” – no common words  
- R _ E _ _ : “R_E__” – e.g., “RIBLE” (not valid), “RIPER” (but P and second R already used)  
- R _ _ E _ : “R__E_” – e.g., “RIGEL” (but G and L are new) – check if valid: “RIGEL” is a valid word (a star name)

Wait, let’s verify:
- R I G E L: letters are R, I, G, E, L  
   - R in 1: allowed (positions 1 or 5)  
   - E in 4: allowed (positions 1,3,4)  
   - D is missing – we need D somewhere. So this is invalid.

We must include D, R, E.

Try:
R _ _ _ _ with D in 2 and E in 3: R D E _ _ – no valid word  
R _ _ _ _ with D in 4 and E in 3: R _ E D _ – need letter in 2 and 5  
   - R I E D _ – “RIED_” – “RIEDS” (but S is out), “RIEDH” (invalid)  
No valid word.

Option 2: R in position 5  
Then:
- E must be in 1, 3, or 4  
- D must be in 2, 3, or 4  

Sub-option 1: _ _ _ _ R  
   - E in 1: E _ _ _ R  
     D must be in 2, 3, or 4  
     - D in 2: E D _ _ R – need two new letters for 3,4  
     - D in 3: E _ D _ R – need two new letters for 2,4  
     - D in 4: E _ _ D R – need two new letters for 2,3  

Sub-option 2: _ _ _ _ R  
   - E in 3: _ _ E _ R  
     D must be in 2 or 4  
Sub-option 3: _ _ _ _ R  
   - E in 4: _ _ _ E R  
     D must be in 2 or 3  

Let’s look for valid words:

- E D _ _ R: “EDD__” – no  
- E _ D _ R: “E D _ _ R” – “EIDER” (but I and second D are new) – check letters: E, I, D, E, R – uses D, E, R and new I, but has double E. The word “EIDER” is valid (a type of duck).  
  - E(1): allowed  
  - I(2): new letter  
  - D(3): allowed  
  - E(4): allowed  
  - R(5): allowed  

This seems valid and uses all required letters.

Another candidate:  
E _ _ D R – “E _ _ D R” – “EJECT” (but J and C are new, but C is out) – invalid.  
“EJECT” has C which is out.  
“ELEDR” – invalid.  

“EIDER” seems the best fit.

Let me double-check constraints:
- Letters used: E, I, D, E, R – all allowed, no forbidden letters (A,O,S,T,N,C,Y)  
- R is in 5: allowed (positions 1 or 5)  
- E is in 1 and 4: allowed (positions 1,3,4)  
- D is in 3: allowed (positions 2,3,4)  

This satisfies every constraint.

and we also know the following letters are NOT in the word at all:
A, O, S, T, N, C, Y, I

The only letter left to determine is the second character (position 2).  
Available letters (not yet ruled out) include: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

The only common 5-letter English word that matches E _ D E R is:

E X D E R   →   “EXDER”  (not a valid word)  
E L D E R   →   “ELDER”  (valid word)

“ELDER” uses L in position 2, which has not been tested yet and is not on the banned list.

Therefore, the secret word must be ELDER.
