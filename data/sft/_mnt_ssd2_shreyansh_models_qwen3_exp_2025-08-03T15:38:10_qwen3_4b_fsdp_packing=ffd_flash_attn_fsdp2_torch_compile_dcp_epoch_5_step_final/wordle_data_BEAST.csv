For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

Looking at these letters, a word like ""AROSE"" comes to mind - it has A, R, O, S, E which are all very common. This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions.

Another good option might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers a nice spread of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 1).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 5).

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ S _  
Letters known to be in the word: A, S, E  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, O  

Since A is in the word but not in position 1, it must be in positions 2, 3, or 5.  
Since E is in the word but not in position 5, it must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.  But position 4 is already S, so E must be in position 2 or 3.

A good next guess should place S in position 4 and try to place A and E in possible remaining positions, while introducing new common consonants.  
Possible candidates:  
- LEASE (but E is already in the word and we don’t know if L is valid)  
- PEASE (P not yet tested)  
- TEASE (T not yet tested)  
- MEASE (M not yet tested)  

""LEASE"" seems good because it:
- Keeps S in position 4.  
- Puts E in position 2 (a new spot for E).  
- Puts A in position 3 (a new spot for A).  
- Introduces L, which is a common consonant.  

Let’s go with ""LEASE"".

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. \n\nSome of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I\'ll try to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.\n\nLooking at these letters, a word like ""AROSE"" comes to mind - it has A, R, O, S, E which are all very common. This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions.\n\nAnother good option might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but I\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers a nice spread of vowels and consonants.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 1).\n- R is not in the word at all.\n- O is not in the word at all.\n- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).\n- E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 5).\n\nSo the secret word looks like: _ _ _ S _  \nLetters known to be in the word: A, S, E  \nLetters known NOT to be in the word: R, O  \n\nSince A is in the word but not in position 1, it must be in positions 2, 3, or 5.  \nSince E is in the word but not in position 5, it must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.  But position 4 is already S, so E must be in position 2 or 3.\n\nA good next guess should place S in position 4 and try to place A and E in possible remaining positions, while introducing new common consonants.  \nPossible candidates:  \n- LEASE (but E is already in the word and we don’t know if L is valid)  \n- PEASE (P not yet tested)  \n- TEASE (T not yet tested)  \n- MEASE (M not yet tested)  \n\n""LEASE"" seems good because it:\n- Keeps S in position 4.  \n- Puts E in position 2 (a new spot for E).  \n- Puts A in position 3 (a new spot for A).  \n- Introduces L, which is a common consonant.  \n\nLet’s go with ""LEASE"".\n\n<guess>LEASE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)\nGuess 2: LEASE -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) S(✓) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two rounds of feedback we now know:\n\n1.
