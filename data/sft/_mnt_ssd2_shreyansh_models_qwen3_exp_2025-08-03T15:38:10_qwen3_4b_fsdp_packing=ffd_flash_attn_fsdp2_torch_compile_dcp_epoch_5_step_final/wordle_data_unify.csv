For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The best starting words often include vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""ADIEU,"" or ""RAISE."" 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - covers common letters and vowels
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - similar idea
- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels
- RAISE: R, A, I, S, E - good mix

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's widely considered one of the best starting words due to its combination of common consonants and vowels.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That immediately eliminates every word that contains any of those five letters.

To maximize information in the second guess, I should choose a word that:
1. Uses none of S, L, A, T, E.
2. Includes other very common letters to test new possibilities.

Common consonants not yet tested: R, N, C, H, D, M, P, B, G, F, K, etc.  
Common vowels not yet tested: I, O, U.

A good strategy is to pick a word with several high-frequency consonants plus a vowel.  
One such word is “CRIMP” (C, R, I, M, P) – it tests three new consonants (C, R, M, P) and the vowel I.  
Another is “ROUND” (R, O, U, N, D).

I’ll choose “ROUND” because it tests three vowels (O, U) and two very common consonants (R, N, D), giving broad coverage.

- Letters completely ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, D
- Letters confirmed to be in the word but not in the positions tried so far: U (not in position 3) and N (not in position 4)

We need a word that:
1. Contains both U and N (since they’re confirmed in the word).
2. Does NOT contain any of the ruled-out letters (S, L, A, T, E, R, O, D).
3. Places U somewhere other than position 3 and N somewhere other than position 4.

- U is in position 3, but we already know U is in the word and can be in position 3 (the feedback only said it wasn’t in position 3 in ROUND, but that doesn’t preclude it elsewhere).  
- N is in position 4, but ROUND had N in position 4 marked “-”, so N cannot be in position 4. Therefore CHUNK is invalid because N would be in position 4.

From all feedback so far:

Letters ruled out (x):  
S, L, A, T, E, R, O, D, G

Letters confirmed to be in the word but not in the positions tried yet:  
U (not in 3, not in 2)  
N (not in 4, not in 3)  
F (not in 1)  
I (not in 5)

So the word must contain {F, U, N, I} and one more letter that is not yet ruled out.  
Available letters (not ruled out): B, C, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to place F, U, N, I plus one extra consonant in positions 1-5 while respecting the positional bans.

Let’s list the positional bans again:
- F cannot be in position 1
- U cannot be in positions 2 or 3
- N cannot be in positions 3 or 4
- I cannot be in position 5

Let’s try to construct a valid word:

One good candidate is “FUNKY”:
- Letters: F, U, N, K, Y – all allowed.
- Positions:
  - F is in position 1 → but F is banned from position 1 → invalid.

Next, “FUNGI” already tried.

Try “HUNKY”:
- H, U, N, K, Y – all allowed.
- U is in position 2 → banned → invalid.

Try “PUCKY”:
- P, U, C, K, Y – but we need to include F, N, I → no F → invalid.

Wait, the word must contain F, U, N, I plus one more letter.  
So the word must be a permutation of {F, U, N, I, X} where X is an extra allowed letter.

Let’s list possible extra letters: B, C, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z.

Try “FUNKY” – already invalid due to F in 1.

Try “PUFFY” – no N, I → invalid.

Try “FUNNY” – has N twice, but we already have N once confirmed, and we need to include F, U, I.  
But “FUNNY” has F, U, N, N, Y – but we only know one N exists → might not work.

Try “FUNKY” again – invalid.

Try “FUMIC” – but G is ruled out, C is allowed.  
Letters: F, U, M, I, C – all allowed.  
Positions:
- F in 1 → banned → invalid.

Try “FUMPY” – same issue.

Try “FUNKY” – same.

Try “PUNIF” – but F is in 5, which is allowed for F (only 1 banned).  
Letters: P, U, N, I, F – all allowed.  
Positions:
- P: allowed in 1  
- U: position 2 → banned → invalid.

Try “UNIFY”:
- U, N, I, F, Y – all allowed.  
Positions:
- U in 1 → allowed  
- N in 2 → allowed  
- I in 3 → allowed  
- F in 4 → allowed  
- Y in 5 → allowed  
This seems valid.

Check against bans:
- F not in 1 → OK (F is in 4)  
- U not in 2 or 3 → OK (U is in 1)  
- N not in 3 or 4 → OK (N is in 2)  
- I not in 5 → OK (I is in 3)  

So “UNIFY” is a valid candidate.

Another candidate: “INUFF” – but double F and U, and F in 5 is allowed, but we need to check positions.  
But “INUFF” has I in 1, N in 2, U in 3 → U in 3 is banned → invalid.

Thus, “UNIFY” seems the best.

Let me verify:  
UNIFY  
U (1) – allowed  
N (2) – allowed  
I (3) – allowed  
F (4) – allowed  
Y (5) – allowed  

No conflicts.

So the next guess is UNIFY.
