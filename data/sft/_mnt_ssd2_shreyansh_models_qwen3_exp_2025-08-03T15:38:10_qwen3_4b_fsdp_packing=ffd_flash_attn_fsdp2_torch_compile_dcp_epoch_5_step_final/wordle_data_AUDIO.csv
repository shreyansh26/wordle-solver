### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc. After considering options, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (S, L, T)
2. These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words
3. It helps eliminate many possibilities by testing multiple letters at once

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we need:
1. A letter A somewhere in the word, but not in position 3.
2. No S, L, T, E in any position.
3. Still test other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good consonants left to test: R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A is confirmed and E is out).

A strong second guess would include A in a different position and test new common letters. ""CRANK"" uses:
- A in position 4 (not 3, so it fits the feedback)
- C, R, N, K which are common and haven't been tested
- No S, L, T, E

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)

   - S, L, T, E are not in the word at all.

2. CRANK → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) K(x)
   - A is again marked as “in word but wrong spot,” and now we know it’s NOT in position 3 or 4.
   - C, R, N, K are all absent.

So far:
- Letters confirmed absent: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K
- Letter confirmed present: A (must be in position 1, 2, or 5)
- Remaining common letters not yet tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a word that:
- Uses A exactly once, in position 1, 2, or 5.
- Uses only the still-available letters.
- Still covers several new consonants and possibly a new vowel.

A good candidate is “MADAM”:
- Uses A twice (but we know the word has only one A, so this is invalid).
Next, “PAINT” – but T is out.
“GAMMA” – A twice again.
“HABIT” – T is out.
“VAPID” – uses A in position 2, and tests V, P, I, D.
“VAPID” is valid and meets all constraints.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):

- A (must be in position 2 or 5, since it was “-” in positions 3 and 4)
- I (✓ in position 4)
- D (must be in the word but NOT in position 5)

So the word looks like: _ A _ I _   (with D somewhere except position 5)

Possible positions for D: 1 or 3.

Remaining unused common letters: B, F, G, H, J, M, O, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
- Has A in position 2 or 5
- Has I in position 4
- Has D in position 1 or 3

Let’s test D in position 1:

Valid word: D A M I O → “DAMIO” (not a recognized English word)
D A B I _ → “DABIN” (invalid)

G A D I _ → “GADIS” (invalid)
H A D I _ → “HADIS” (invalid)
M A D I _ → “MADIS” (invalid)
F A D I _ → “FADIS” (invalid)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include letters like A, E, T, R, S, N, L, etc. After considering options, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (S, L, T)
2. These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words
3. It helps eliminate many possibilities by testing multiple letters at once

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we need:
1. A letter A somewhere in the word, but not in position 3.
2. No S, L, T, E in any position.
3. Still test other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good consonants left to test: R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A is confirmed and E is out).

A strong second guess would include A in a different position and test new common letters. ""CRANK"" uses:
- A in position 4 (not 3, so it fits the feedback)
- C, R, N, K which are common and haven't been tested
- No S, L, T, E

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - S, L, T, E are not in the word at all.

2. CRANK → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) K(x)
   - A is again marked as “in word but wrong spot,” and now we know it’s NOT in position 3 or 4.
   - C, R, N, K are all absent.

So far:
- Letters confirmed absent: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K
- Letter confirmed present: A (must be in position 1, 2, or 5)
- Remaining common letters not yet tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y

We need a word that:
- Uses A exactly once, in position 1, 2, or 5.
- Uses only the still-available letters.
- Still covers several new consonants and possibly a new vowel.

A good candidate is “MADAM”:
- Uses A twice (but we know the word has only one A, so this is invalid).
Next, “PAINT” – but T is out.
“GAMMA” – A twice again.
“HABIT” – T is out.
“VAPID” – uses A in position 2, and tests V, P, I, D.
“VAPID” is valid and meets all constraints.

Let’s go with “VAPID”.

Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:

- I is in position 4 (✓)
- D is in the word but NOT in position 1 or 5 (because it was “-” in positions 1 and 5 so far)
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (it was “-” in positions 2, 3, 4 and we just saw “-” in 5).  
  Therefore A must be in position 1.

So the word must be: A U _ I _

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
F, G, H, J, M, O, Q, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter English word of the form A U _ I _ using only these letters.

Possible consonants for position 3: F, G, H, J, M, O, Q, W, X, Y, Z  
Possible consonants for position 5: F, G, H, J, M, O, Q, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s list valid English words fitting A U _ I _:

- A U G I F – not valid
- A U G I M – not valid
- A U G I Y – not valid
- A U F I Y – not valid
- A U G I Y – not valid
- A U M I Y – not valid
- A U G I F – not valid

Check letters: A, U, D, I, O  
- A is allowed in position 1  
- U is allowed in position 2  
- D is allowed in position 3 (never tested there)  
- I is allowed in position 4  
- O is allowed in position 5  

All letters are from the still-allowed set, and “AUDIO” is a valid 5-letter word.

Therefore, the next guess should be AUDIO.
