### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good starting word should have:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information gain

Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc. I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:

- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct

Summary of what we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word at all: A, S, E, N, D  
2. Letters that ARE in the word:  
   - R is in position 1 (✓)  
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)  
   - U is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)  

So the pattern so far:  
R _ _ _ _  
with O and U somewhere in positions 2–5, but NOT in their previous spots.

Remaining common letters to test: T, L, I, C, K, M, P, etc.

We need a word that:
- Starts with R  
- Contains both O and U  
- Avoids A, S, E, N, D  
- Uses new positions for O and U (O≠2, U≠3)

Possible candidates:
- RATIO – but A is out  
- RUTTY – but T is repeated and Y is uncommon  
- RUMBO – but B is uncommon and O is in position 5 (allowed)  
- RUKUS – S is out  
- RIVET – E is out  

A good choice is RUMBO:
- R in position 1 (✓)  
- U in position 2 (new spot)  
- M, B, O in positions 3,4,5 (B is less common but acceptable)  
- Avoids all excluded letters  

Another strong candidate is RUKUS, but S is excluded so that’s fine. However, RUKUS uses S indirectly (UKUS), but S is already excluded. So RUMBO is better.

Wait, RUMBO uses B which we haven’t tested yet. Let’s go with that.

But let me double-check:  
RUMBO: R(1) U(2) M(3) B(4) O(5)  
- R is correct in position 1  
- O is in position 5 (allowed, since it was only excluded from position 2)  
- U is in position 2 (allowed, since it was only excluded from position 3)  
- Uses new letters M, B  

This seems optimal.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- RUKUS – S is out  
- RIVET – E is out  

A good choice is RUMBO:
- R in position 1 (✓)  
- U in position 2 (new spot)  
- M, B, O in positions 3,4,5 (B is less common but acceptable)  
- Avoids all excluded letters  

Another strong candidate is RUKUS, but S is excluded so that’s fine. However, RUKUS uses S indirectly (UKUS), but S is already excluded. So RUMBO is better.

Wait, RUMBO uses B which we haven’t tested yet. Let’s go with that.

But let me double-check:  
RUMBO: R(1) U(2) M(3) B(4) O(5)  
- R is correct in position 1  
- O is in position 5 (allowed, since it was only excluded from position 2)  
- U is in position 2 (allowed, since it was only excluded from position 3)  
- Uses new letters M, B  

This seems optimal.

Current confirmed facts:
1. Pattern so far: R U M _ _
2. Letters known to be in the word: R, U, M, O
3. Letters known NOT in the word: A, S, E, N, D, B
4. Position constraints:
   - O must appear somewhere, but NOT in position 5 (because in RUMBO, O in position 5 got “-” feedback, meaning it’s in the word but wrong position).

So the word looks like: R U M _ O

We need a 5-letter English word that starts with RUM and ends with O, using only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible endings for RUM _ O:
- RUMBO – already tried, B is out
- RUMBO is invalid because B is excluded
- RUMPO – P is still allowed
- RUMHO – H is allowed
- RUMGO – G is allowed
- RUMKO – K is allowed
- RUMLO – L is allowed

The only common English word that fits is RUMPO, but checking its validity:
- RUMPO is a valid word (a unit of weight for gems).

However, let’s verify if any other common word fits:
- RUMBO is invalid (B out)
- RUMHO, RUMGO, etc., are not standard words.

Thus, the only plausible word left is RUMPO.

But wait, let me double-check:
- RUMPO: R(1) U(2) M(3) P(4) O(5)
- B is excluded, P is new
- O in position 5 was previously marked “-”, meaning O is in the word but not in position 5. This is a contradiction because RUMPO places O in position 5.

This tells me O cannot be in position 5, so the pattern must be R U M _ _ with O somewhere in positions 4 or 5 (but not 5), so position 4.

Thus, the word must be R U M O _.

Now we need a letter for position 5 that is not yet excluded and forms a valid word.

Letters still allowed: C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, S, E, N, D, B).

Possible endings for RUMO _:
- RUMOR – R is already used in position 1, but R is allowed to repeat? The rules don’t forbid repeats, but we have no evidence R repeats. Also, O is in position 4 here, which is allowed.
- RUMPS – S is excluded
- RUMPH – H is allowed
- RUMPO – P is allowed
- RUMPS, RUMPO, RUMPH, RUMOR are possibilities.

RUMOR is a common word and fits:
- R U M O R
- R in position 5 would be a repeat, but the rules don’t forbid it.
- O in position 4 is allowed (was only excluded from 5)
- All letters used are either confirmed or allowed.

Therefore, RUMOR is the best next guess.
