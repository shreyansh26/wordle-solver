For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Let's digest the new feedback from TRAIN:

- T(x) → T is not in the word  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2  
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3  
- I(-) → I is in the word but not in position 4  
- N(x) → N is not in the word  

Summary so far:
- Must contain: A, R, I  
- Must NOT contain: O, S, E, T, N  
- A ≠ position 1, R ≠ position 2, A ≠ position 3, I ≠ position 4  

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, R, I and two new letters (from the remaining alphabet excluding the forbidden ones). Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: only U is left (since A and I are already confirmed; E is out).

A promising pattern is to place A and I in positions where they haven't been tried yet and to introduce two new consonants.  
Let’s try “FRAIL”:

- F and L are new letters  
- R in position 1 (allowed since R is only forbidden in position 2)  
- A in position 2 (allowed since A is only forbidden in positions 1 and 3)  
- I in position 3 (allowed since I is only forbidden in position 4)  
- L is new  

This tests F and L while respecting all constraints.

Let's update the constraints from all feedback so far:

Letters we KNOW are in the word: A, R, I  
Letters we KNOW are NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, N, F, L  

Position restrictions:
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3
- R cannot be in position 2
- I cannot be in position 4

We still need two more letters (since the word is 5 letters long).  
Available letters (excluding the banned ones and the known A, R, I):  
B, C, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want to pick two new letters that are common enough to give good information.  
Good candidates: B, C, D, G, H, M, P, U, Y

Let’s try to construct a word that:
1. Uses A, R, I in allowed positions
2. Adds two new letters from the available pool
3. Keeps the word valid (i.e., exists in English)

One systematic way is to list possible positions for A, R, I and fill the rest with new letters.

Possible positions:
- A can be in 2, 4, or 5
- R can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)
- I can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4)

Let’s try placing A in position 2, R in position 3, and I in position 1:

Possible positions:
A: 2, 4, 5

Try ""VIRGA"":

Check if ""VIRGA"" is valid – yes, it's a valid English word (a type of plant).  

Let’s verify constraints:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, E are not in the word at all

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R, but not O, S, E
- A is not in position 1
- R is not in position 2

I want a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R in different positions than before
2. Avoids O, S, E
3. Introduces new common letters to maximize information gain

Good candidate letters to try next: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

A strong choice is ""TRAIN"":
- Uses A (not in position 1) and R (not in position 2)
- Introduces T, I, N
- Avoids O, S, E

Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) I(-) N(x)

Let's digest the new feedback from TRAIN:

- T(x) → T is not in the word  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2  
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3  
- I(-) → I is in the word but not in position 4  
- N(x) → N is not in the word  

Summary so far:
- Must contain: A, R, I  
- Must NOT contain: O, S, E, T, N  
- A ≠ position 1, R ≠ position 2, A ≠ position 3, I ≠ position 4  

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, R, I and two new letters (from the remaining alphabet excluding the forbidden ones). Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: only U is left (since A and I are already confirmed; E is out).

A promising pattern is to place A and I in positions where they haven't been tried yet and to introduce two new consonants.  
Let’s try “FRAIL”:

- F and L are new letters  
- R in position 1 (allowed since R is only forbidden in position 2)  
- A in position 2 (allowed since A is only forbidden in positions 1 and 3)  
- I in position 3 (allowed since I is only forbidden in position 4)  
- L is new  

This tests F and L while respecting all constraints.

Let's update everything we now know after the fourth guess.

Letters we KNOW are in the word:
- V (✓) – position 1
- I (✓) – position 2
- R – somewhere, but not position 3 (from VIRGA feedback: R(-))
- A – somewhere, but not position 4 (from VIRGA feedback: A(-))

Letters we KNOW are NOT in the word:
O, S, E, T, N, F, L, G

So the pattern so far is:
V I _ _ _

R and A must appear somewhere in positions 3, 4, 5, but:
- R cannot be in position 3
- A cannot be in position 4

Therefore:
- R must be in position 4 or 5
- A must be in position 3 or 5

But positions 3, 4, 5 must contain both R and A exactly once each.

Possible arrangements for positions 3-5:
1. A R _ – but R cannot be in position 3 (it would be position 2 here, which is already I)
2. _ A R – R would be position 3 (invalid)
3. R A _ – R in position 1 (already V), so this is invalid
4. _ R A – R in position 2 (already I), so invalid
5. A _ R – R in position 3 (invalid)
6. R _ A – R in position 1 (invalid)

Wait, let's systematically list the possible positions for R and A:

Possible positions for R: 4, 5
Possible positions for A: 3, 5

And they must be in different positions.

So:
- If R is in 4, then A must be in 3 or 5
  - A in 3: V I A R _
  - A in 5: V I _ R A

- If R is in 5, then A must be in 3 or 4
  - A in 3: V I A _ R
  - A in 4: V I _ A R (but A cannot be in 4 from VIRGA feedback)

So the valid patterns are:
1. V I A R _
2. V I _ R A
3. V I A _ R

Now we need to pick a fifth letter that:
- is not any of the banned letters (O, S, E, T, N, F, L, G)
- is not V, I, R, A (they are already used)

Available letters: B, C, D, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

Let's try to find valid words for each pattern.

Pattern 1: V I A R _
Need a letter for position 5. Possible letters: B, C, D, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z
Looking for valid words:
- V I A R B – ""VIA RB"" – invalid
- V I A R C – ""VIA RC"" – invalid
- V I A R D – ""VIA RD"" – invalid
- V I A R H – ""VIA RH"" – invalid
- V I A R M – ""VIA RM"" – invalid
- V I A R Y – ""VIA RY"" – invalid
- V I A R K – ""VIA RK"" – invalid

- V I A R M – already checked
- V I A R Y – already checked
- V I A R K – already checked
- V I A R P – already checked
- V I A R U – already checked

Hmm, seems like none of these combinations form valid English words. Let's move to the next pattern.

Pattern 2: V I _ R A
Need a letter for position 3. Possible letters: B, C, D, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z
Looking for valid words:
- V I B R A – ""VIBRA"" – valid English word (a vibration)
- V I C R A – ""VICRA"" – invalid
- V I D R A – ""VIDRA"" – invalid
- V I H R A – ""VIHRA"" – invalid
- V I K R A – ""VIKRA"" – invalid
- V I M R A – ""VIMRA"" – invalid
- V I P R A – ""VIPRA"" – invalid

- V I U R A – ""VIURA"" – invalid
- V I W R A – ""VIWRA"" – invalid
- V I X R A – ""VIXRA"" – invalid
- V I Y R A – ""VIYRA"" – invalid
- V I Z R A – ""VIZRA"" – invalid

""VIBRA"" seems to be the only valid word here.

Pattern 3: V I A _ R
Need a letter for position 4. Possible letters: B, C, D, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z
Looking for valid words:
- V I A B R – ""VIA BR"" – invalid
- V I A C R – ""VIA CR"" – invalid
- V I A D R – ""VIA DR"" – invalid
- V I A H R – ""VIA HR"" – invalid
- V I A K R – ""VIA KR"" – invalid

- V I A P R – ""VIA PR"" – invalid

- V I A W R – ""VIA WR"" – invalid
- V I A X R – ""VIA XR"" – invalid
- V I A Y R – ""VIA YR"" – invalid
- V I A Z R – ""VIA ZR"" – invalid

None of these seem to form valid English words.

Therefore, the only valid word left is ""VIBRA"" from pattern 2.
</think>

<guess>VIBRA</guess>",VIBRA,"Let's update everything we now know after the fourth guess.

Letters we KNOW are in the word:
- V (✓) – position 1
- I (✓) – position 2
- R – somewhere, but not position 3 (from VIRGA feedback: R(-))
- A – somewhere, but not position 4 (from VIRGA feedback: A(-))

Letters we KNOW are NOT in the word:
O, S, E, T, N, F, L, G

So the pattern so far is:
V I _ _ _

R and A must appear somewhere in positions 3, 4, 5, but:
- R cannot be in position 3
- A cannot be in position 4

Therefore:
- R must be in position 4 or 5
- A must be in position 3 or 5

But positions 3, 4, 5 must contain both R and A exactly once each.

Possible arrangements for positions 3-5:
1. A R _ – but R cannot be in position 3 (it would be position 2 here, which is already I)
2. _ A R – R would be position 3 (invalid)
3. R A _ – R in position 1 (already V), so this is invalid
4. _ R A – R in position 2 (already I), so invalid
5. A _ R – R in position 3 (invalid)
6. R _ A – R in position 1 (invalid)

Wait, let's systematically list the possible positions for R and A:

Possible positions for R: 4, 5
Possible positions for A: 3, 5

And they must be in different positions.

So:
- If R is in 4, then A must be in 3 or 5
  - A in 3: V I A R _
  - A in 5: V I _ R A

- If R is in 5, then A must be in 3 or 4
  - A in 3: V I A _ R
  - A in 4: V I _ A R (but A cannot be in 4 from VIRGA feedback)

So the valid patterns are:
1. V I A R _
2. V I _ R A
3. V I A _ R

Now we need to pick a fifth letter that:
- is not any of the banned letters (O, S, E, T, N, F, L, G)
- is not V, I, R, A (they are already used)

Available letters: B, C, D, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

Let's try to find valid words for each pattern.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The best starting words typically include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, E are not in the word at all

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R, but not O, S, E
- A is not in position 1
- R is not in position 2

I want a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R in different positions than before
2. Avoids O, S, E
3. Introduces new common letters to maximize information gain

Good candidate letters to try next: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

A strong choice is ""TRAIN"":
- Uses A (not in position 1) and R (not in position 2)
- Introduces T, I, N
- Avoids O, S, E

Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) I(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's digest the new feedback from TRAIN:

- T(x) → T is not in the word  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2  
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3  
- I(-) → I is in the word but not in position 4  
- N(x) → N is not in the word  

Summary so far:
- Must contain: A, R, I  
- Must NOT contain: O, S, E, T, N  
- A ≠ position 1, R ≠ position 2, A ≠ position 3, I ≠ position 4  

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, R, I and two new letters (from the remaining alphabet excluding the forbidden ones). Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: only U is left (since A and I are already confirmed; E is out).

A promising pattern is to place A and I in positions where they haven't been tried yet and to introduce two new consonants.  
Let’s try “FRAIL”:

- F and L are new letters  
- R in position 1 (allowed since R is only forbidden in position 2)  
- A in position 2 (allowed since A is only forbidden in positions 1 and 3)  
- I in position 3 (allowed since I is only forbidden in position 4)  
- L is new  

This tests F and L while respecting all constraints.

Let's update the constraints from all feedback so far:

Letters we KNOW are in the word: A, R, I  
Letters we KNOW are NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, N, F, L  

Position restrictions:
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3
- R cannot be in position 2
- I cannot be in position 4

We still need two more letters (since the word is 5 letters long).  
Available letters (excluding the banned ones and the known A, R, I):  
B, C, D, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want to pick two new letters that are common enough to give good information.  
Good candidates: B, C, D, G, H, M, P, U, Y

Let’s try to construct a word that:
1. Uses A, R, I in allowed positions
2. Adds two new letters from the available pool
3. Keeps the word valid (i.e., exists in English)

One systematic way is to list possible positions for A, R, I and fill the rest with new letters.

Possible positions:
- A can be in 2, 4, or 5
- R can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not 2)
- I can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4)

Let’s try placing A in position 2, R in position 3, and I in position 1:
I _ R A _

We need two more letters. Let’s pick common ones like B and D:  
I B R A D → ""IBRAD"" – not a valid word  
I B R A C → ""IBRAC"" – not valid  
I M R A C → ""IMRAC"" – not valid  

Try A in position 4, R in position 1, I in position 2:

R I D D A – invalid

Wait, ""RICH A"" is actually 4 letters. We need 5.  

Try R I C H A – but that's 5 letters: R I C H A → ""RICH A"" is actually 5 letters (R-I-C-H-A).  
Is ""RICH A"" a valid word? No, it's not.  

Try R I C A B – ""RICA B"" – no.  

Try A in position 5, R in position 1, I in position 2:

Need two more letters. Let’s pick common ones:  
B I A M R – ""BIAMR"" – invalid  
C I A M R – ""CIAMR"" – invalid  

This is tricky. Let’s try a different approach: list valid 5-letter words containing A, R, I, avoiding banned letters and respecting position restrictions.

Known letters: A, R, I  
Banned letters: O, S, E, T, N, F, L  

Possible positions:
A: 2, 4, 5  
R: 1, 3, 4, 5  
I: 1, 2, 3, 5  

Let’s try ""CRIAR"":
- C: new letter  
- R: position 2 – but R is banned in position 2 – invalid  

Try ""DRIAR"":
- D: new letter  
- R: position 2 – banned – invalid  

Try ""PRIAR"":
- P: new letter  
- R: position 2 – banned – invalid  

Try ""VIRGA"":
- V: new letter  
- I: position 1 – allowed  
- R: position 3 – allowed  
- G: new letter  
- A: position 5 – allowed  

Check if ""VIRGA"" is valid – yes, it's a valid English word (a type of plant).  

Let’s verify constraints:
- Contains A, R, I – yes  
- Does NOT contain O, S, E, T, N, F, L – yes  
- A is in position 5 (allowed)  
- R is in position 3 (allowed)  
- I is in position 1 (allowed)  

This seems perfect.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) I(-) N(x)
Guess 3: FRAIL -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(-) A(-) I(-) L(x)
Guess 4: VIRGA -> FEEDBACK: V(✓) I(✓) R(-) G(x) A(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's update everything we now know after the fourth guess.

Letters we KNOW are in the word:
- V (✓) – position 1
- I (✓) – position 2
- R – somewhere, but not position 3 (from VIRGA feedback: R(-))
- A – somewhere, but not position 4 (from VIRGA feedback: A(-))

Letters we KNOW are NOT in the word:
O, S, E, T, N, F, L, G

So the pattern so far is:
V I _ _ _

R and A must appear somewhere in positions 3, 4, 5, but:
- R cannot be in position 3
- A cannot be in position 4

Therefore:
- R must be in position 4 or 5
- A must be in position 3 or 5

But positions 3, 4, 5 must contain both R and A exactly once each.

Possible arrangements for positions 3-5:
1. A R _ – but R cannot be in position 3 (it would be position 2 here, which is already I)
2. _ A R – R would be position 3 (invalid)
3. R A _ – R in position 1 (already V), so this is invalid
4. _ R A – R in position 2 (already I), so invalid
5. A _ R – R in position 3 (invalid)
6. R _ A – R in position 1 (invalid)

Wait, let's systematically list the possible positions for R and A:

Possible positions for R: 4, 5
Possible positions for A: 3, 5

And they must be in different positions.

So:
- If R is in 4, then A must be in 3 or 5
  - A in 3: V I A R _
  - A in 5: V I _ R A

- If R is in 5, then A must be in 3 or 4
  - A in 3: V I A _ R
  - A in 4: V I _ A R (but A cannot be in 4 from VIRGA feedback)

So the valid patterns are:
1. V I A R _
2. V I _ R A
3. V I A _ R

Now we need to pick a fifth letter that:
- is not any of the banned letters (O, S, E, T, N, F, L, G)
- is not V, I, R, A (they are already used)

Available letters: B, C, D, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

Let's try to find valid words for each pattern.

Pattern 1: V I A R _
Need a letter for position 5. Possible letters: B, C, D, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z
Looking for valid words:
- V I A R B – ""VIA RB"" – invalid
- V I A R C – ""VIA RC"" – invalid
- V I A R D – ""VIA RD"" – invalid
- V I A R H – ""VIA RH"" – invalid
- V I A R M – ""VIA RM"" – invalid
- V I A R Y – ""VIA RY"" – invalid
- V I A R K – ""VIA RK"" – invalid
- V I A R P – ""VIA RP"" – invalid
- V I A R U – ""VIA RU"" – invalid
- V I A R D – already checked
- V I A R C – already checked
- V I A R B – already checked
- V I A R M – already checked
- V I A R Y – already checked
- V I A R K – already checked
- V I A R P – already checked
- V I A R U – already checked
- V I A R D – already checked
- V I A R C – already checked
- V I A R B – already checked
- V I A R M – already checked
- V I A R Y – already checked
- V I A R K – already checked
- V I A R P – already checked
- V I A R U – already checked

Hmm, seems like none of these combinations form valid English words. Let's move to the next pattern.

Pattern 2: V I _ R A
Need a letter for position 3. Possible letters: B, C, D, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z
Looking for valid words:
- V I B R A – ""VIBRA"" – valid English word (a vibration)
- V I C R A – ""VICRA"" – invalid
- V I D R A – ""VIDRA"" – invalid
- V I H R A – ""VIHRA"" – invalid
- V I K R A – ""VIKRA"" – invalid
- V I M R A – ""VIMRA"" – invalid
- V I P R A – ""VIPRA"" – invalid
- V I Q R A – ""VIQRA"" – invalid
- V I U R A – ""VIURA"" – invalid
- V I W R A – ""VIWRA"" – invalid
- V I X R A – ""VIXRA"" – invalid
- V I Y R A – ""VIYRA"" – invalid
- V I Z R A – ""VIZRA"" – invalid

""VIBRA"" seems to be the only valid word here.

Pattern 3: V I A _ R
Need a letter for position 4. Possible letters: B, C, D, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z
Looking for valid words:
- V I A B R – ""VIA BR"" – invalid
- V I A C R – ""VIA CR"" – invalid
- V I A D R – ""VIA DR"" – invalid
- V I A H R – ""VIA HR"" – invalid
- V I A K R – ""VIA KR"" – invalid
- V I A M R – ""VIA MR"" – invalid
- V I A P R – ""VIA PR"" – invalid
- V I A Q R – ""VIA QR"" – invalid
- V I A U R – ""VIA UR"" – invalid
- V I A W R – ""VIA WR"" – invalid
- V I A X R – ""VIA XR"" – invalid
- V I A Y R – ""VIA YR"" – invalid
- V I A Z R – ""VIA ZR"" – invalid

None of these seem to form valid English words.

Therefore, the only valid word left is ""VIBRA"" from pattern 2.

Let's consolidate everything we now know after five guesses.

Known letters in the word (and their positions):
- V is in position 1 (✓)
- I is in position 2 (✓)

Known letters that must appear somewhere in the remaining three slots (positions 3-5):
- R (from VIRGA: R(-) and VIBRA: R(-)) – but R cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (position 2 is already I, position 3 was rejected by VIRGA, position 4 was rejected by VIBRA). So R must be in position 5.

- A (from VIRGA: A(-) and VIBRA: A(-)) – but A cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (position 2 is I, position 3 and 4 were rejected). So A must be in position 3.

So the pattern is now:
V I A _ R

We need a single letter for position 4 that:
- is NOT any of the banned letters (O, S, E, T, N, F, L, G, B)
- is NOT any of the already-used letters (V, I, A, R)

Available letters for position 4: C, D, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for valid English 5-letter words that fit V I A _ R:

- V I A C R – invalid
- V I A D R – invalid
- V I A H R – invalid
- V I A K R – invalid
- V I A M R – invalid
- V I A P R – invalid
- V I A Q R – invalid
- V I A U R – invalid
- V I A W R – invalid
- V I A X R – invalid
- V I A Y R – invalid
- V I A Z R – invalid

The only remaining valid English word that fits is ""VIAGR"" – but that's not a recognized word. 

Wait, let's double-check: is there any other word? 

Looking at the pattern V I A _ R, the only common English word is ""VIAGR"" which is not valid. 

But there's another possibility: maybe I missed a letter. Let me re-examine available letters.

Looking back at the banned list: O, S, E, T, N, F, L, G, B  
Used letters: V, I, A, R  
Available: C, D, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

Looking through these, the only one that forms a valid word is ""VIA"" plus ""CR"" or ""DR"" etc., but none are valid.

However, there's one more: ""VIARD"" – but that's 5 letters: V I A R D, but R is already in position 5.

Wait, the pattern is V I A _ R, so position 4 must be a single letter between A and R.

Looking again, the only valid English word that fits is ""VIAGR"" – but that's not valid. 

But ""VIARD"" is 5 letters: V I A R D, but that would be V I A R D, which is V I A R D – but R is in position 4, which was rejected by VIBRA.

This suggests I might have made an error in deducing positions.

Let me re-examine:

From VIRGA: V(✓) I(✓) R(-) G(x) A(-)
- R is in the word but not in position 3
- A is in the word but not in position 5

From VIBRA: V(✓) I(✓) B(x) R(-) A(-)
- R is in the word but not in position 4
- A is in the word but not in position 5

So R cannot be in positions 3 or 4, and A cannot be in position 5.

But positions 3-5 must contain both R and A exactly once each, and position 5 cannot be A (from VIBRA). So A must be in position 3 or 4, and R must be in position 5 (since it can't be 3 or 4).

So pattern is:
V I _ _ R with A in position 3 or 4.

Case 1: A in position 3 → V I A _ R
Need a letter for position 4 from available letters: C, D, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z
But none of these form valid words.

Case 2: A in position 4 → V I _ A R
Need a letter for position 3 from available letters: C, D, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z
Looking for valid words:
- V I C A R – ""VICAR"" – valid English word (short for vicarage or vicar's)
- V I D A R – ""VIDAR"" – invalid
- V I H A R – ""VIHAR"" – invalid
- V I K A R – ""VIKAR"" – invalid
- V I M A R – ""VIMAR"" – invalid
- V I P A R – ""VIPAR"" – invalid
- V I Q A R – ""VIQAR"" – invalid
- V I U A R – ""VIUAR"" – invalid
- V I W A R – ""VIWAR"" – invalid
- V I X A R – ""VIXAR"" – invalid
- V I Y A R – ""VIYAR"" – invalid
- V I Z A R – ""VIZAR"" – invalid

""VICAR"" is the only valid word here.

Let me verify:
- V(✓) position 1
- I(✓) position 2
- C new letter
- A in position 4 (allowed, since A cannot be in 5)
- R in position 5 (allowed, since R cannot be in 3 or 4)

This fits all constraints.

<guess>VICAR</guess>",VICAR,"Let's consolidate everything we now know after five guesses.

Known letters in the word (and their positions):
- V is in position 1 (✓)
- I is in position 2 (✓)

Known letters that must appear somewhere in the remaining three slots (positions 3-5):
- R (from VIRGA: R(-) and VIBRA: R(-)) – but R cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (position 2 is already I, position 3 was rejected by VIRGA, position 4 was rejected by VIBRA). So R must be in position 5.

- A (from VIRGA: A(-) and VIBRA: A(-)) – but A cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (position 2 is I, position 3 and 4 were rejected). So A must be in position 3.

So the pattern is now:
V I A _ R

We need a single letter for position 4 that:
- is NOT any of the banned letters (O, S, E, T, N, F, L, G, B)
- is NOT any of the already-used letters (V, I, A, R)

Available letters for position 4: C, D, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for valid English 5-letter words that fit V I A _ R:

- V I A C R – invalid
- V I A D R – invalid
- V I A H R – invalid
- V I A K R – invalid
- V I A M R – invalid
- V I A P R – invalid
- V I A Q R – invalid
- V I A U R – invalid
- V I A W R – invalid
- V I A X R – invalid
- V I A Y R – invalid
- V I A Z R – invalid

The only remaining valid English word that fits is ""VIAGR"" – but that's not a recognized word. 

Wait, let's double-check: is there any other word? 

Looking at the pattern V I A _ R, the only common English word is ""VIAGR"" which is not valid. 

But there's another possibility: maybe I missed a letter. Let me re-examine available letters.

Looking back at the banned list: O, S, E, T, N, F, L, G, B  
Used letters: V, I, A, R  
Available: C, D, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

Looking through these, the only one that forms a valid word is ""VIA"" plus ""CR"" or ""DR"" etc., but none are valid.

However, there's one more: ""VIARD"" – but that's 5 letters: V I A R D, but R is already in position 5.

Wait, the pattern is V I A _ R, so position 4 must be a single letter between A and R.

Looking again, the only valid English word that fits is ""VIAGR"" – but that's not valid. 

But ""VIARD"" is 5 letters: V I A R D, but that would be V I A R D, which is V I A R D – but R is in position 4, which was rejected by VIBRA.

This suggests I might have made an error in deducing positions.

Let me re-examine:

From VIRGA: V(✓) I(✓) R(-) G(x) A(-)
- R is in the word but not in position 3
- A is in the word but not in position 5

From VIBRA: V(✓) I(✓) B(x) R(-) A(-)
- R is in the word but not in position 4
- A is in the word but not in position 5

So R cannot be in positions 3 or 4, and A cannot be in position 5.

But positions 3-5 must contain both R and A exactly once each, and position 5 cannot be A (from VIBRA). So A must be in position 3 or 4, and R must be in position 5 (since it can't be 3 or 4).

So pattern is:
V I _ _ R with A in position 3 or 4.

Case 1: A in position 3 → V I A _ R
Need a letter for position 4 from available letters: C, D, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z
But none of these form valid words.

Case 2: A in position 4 → V I _ A R
Need a letter for position 3 from available letters: C, D, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z
Looking for valid words:
- V I C A R – ""VICAR"" – valid English word (short for vicarage or vicar's)
- V I D A R – ""VIDAR"" – invalid
- V I H A R – ""VIHAR"" – invalid
- V I K A R – ""VIKAR"" – invalid
- V I M A R – ""VIMAR"" – invalid
- V I P A R – ""VIPAR"" – invalid
- V I Q A R – ""VIQAR"" – invalid
- V I U A R – ""VIUAR"" – invalid
- V I W A R – ""VIWAR"" – invalid
- V I X A R – ""VIXAR"" – invalid
- V I Y A R – ""VIYAR"" – invalid
- V I Z A R – ""VIZAR"" – invalid

""VICAR"" is the only valid word here.

Let me verify:
- V(✓) position 1
- I(✓) position 2
- C new letter
- A in position 4 (allowed, since A cannot be in 5)
- R in position 5 (allowed, since R cannot be in 3 or 4)

This fits all constraints.",Guess 6: VICAR -> FEEDBACK: V(✓) I(✓) C(✓) A(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
