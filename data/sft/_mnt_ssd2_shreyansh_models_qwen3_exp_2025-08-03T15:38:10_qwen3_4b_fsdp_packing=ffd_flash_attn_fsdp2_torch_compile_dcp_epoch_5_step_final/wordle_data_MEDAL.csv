Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should have frequently used letters in English like A, E, T, R, S, O, L, N, etc.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to maximize information gain from the feedback.

- E is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- R is NOT in the word.
- L is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the secret word:

- L cannot be in positions 2 or 4.
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- E cannot be in positions 1 or 5.

Good remaining consonants to test: N, D, C, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: O, I, U (since A and E are already confirmed).

Let’s try to place L, A, E in new positions and fill the remaining two spots with fresh common letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 5
Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 2, 3, 4

Let’s construct a word:
- Put L in position 1 (new spot for L).
- Put A in position 4 (new spot for A).
- Put E in position 2 (new spot for E).
- Need two more letters that are NOT S, T, R, Y. Let’s pick common ones like N and D.

Candidate word: L E A N D → “LEAND” (not a valid English word).
Try swapping: L E A N _ → “LEANE” (invalid).
Try “LEMON” – contains M, O (both fresh), positions:
- L in 1 (allowed)
- E in 2 (allowed)
- M in 3 (new letter)
- O in 4 (new letter)
- N in 5 (new letter)

Let’s tabulate everything we know so far.

Letters we are certain are in the word: L, A, E  
Letters we are certain are NOT in the word: S, T, R, Y, O, N, M

Positions ruled out for each of the three known letters:

- L: not in 2, 4, 1 (from SLATE, EARLY, LEMON)  
  ⇒ L can only be in position 3 or 5.

- A: not in 3, 2 (from SLATE, EARLY)  
  ⇒ A can be in 1, 4, 5.

- E: not in 5, 1, 2 (from SLATE, EARLY, LEMON)  
  ⇒ E can be in 3 or 4.

Also, the word must contain exactly the letters L, A, E plus two fresh letters that are not among the forbidden set {S,T,R,Y,O,N,M}.  
Common unused consonants: D, G, H, K, P, B, C, F, etc.  
Unused vowels: I, U.

We need a valid 5-letter word that uses L, A, E in permissible positions and two new letters.

Let’s try to build a candidate:

Place E in position 3 (allowed).  
Place L in position 5 (allowed).  
Place A in position 4 (allowed).  
We now have: _ _ E A L

We need two new letters for positions 1 and 2.  
Pick common ones: D and I.

Candidate: D I E A L → “DIEAL” (invalid).  
Swap to “DIALE” (invalid).  
Swap to “IELD A” (invalid).  
Try “DEIAL” (invalid).

Instead, let’s place E in position 4 and L in position 3:

Place A in position 1 or 5 (but 5 is open).

P(2) – new letter, allowed  
E(3) – allowed  
E(4) – E can be in 3 or 4 – 4 is allowed

“APEEL” is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

Let me double-check:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should have frequently used letters in English like A, E, T, R, S, O, L, N, etc.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to maximize information gain from the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S (x) – not in the word at all  
- L (-) – in the word, but not in position 2  
- A (-) – in the word, but not in position 3  
- T (x) – not in the word  
- E (-) – in the word, but not in position 5  

So the secret word:
- contains L, A, E  
- does NOT contain S or T  
- L is not in position 2, A is not in position 3, E is not in position 5  

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- uses L, A, E (in different positions)  
- avoids S and T  
- places L, A, E in positions they haven’t been tried in yet  

Good candidate letters to test next: R, N, I, C, O, D, etc.  
Let’s try a word that shifts L, A, E to new positions and adds new common letters.  
“REAL” is only 4 letters, so we need a 5-letter word.  
“EARLY” has E in position 1 (new), A in 2 (new), R (new), L in 4 (new), Y (new).  
But we already know L is in the word (from feedback), so “EARLY” is valid because it contains L, A, E.  

However, “EARLY” has L in position 4, which hasn’t been tested yet, and shifts A to position 2 and E to position 1.  
This seems like a good next guess to gather more information.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (SLATE):
- S, T are NOT in the word.
- L, A, E ARE in the word, but each in the wrong positions (positions 2, 3, 5 respectively).

From Guess 2 (EARLY):
- E is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- R is NOT in the word.
- L is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- Y is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains exactly the letters L, A, E (and three other letters that are NOT S, T, R, Y).
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 4.
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- E cannot be in positions 1 or 5.

Good remaining consonants to test: N, D, C, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: O, I, U (since A and E are already confirmed).

Let’s try to place L, A, E in new positions and fill the remaining two spots with fresh common letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 5
Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 2, 3, 4

Let’s construct a word:
- Put L in position 1 (new spot for L).
- Put A in position 4 (new spot for A).
- Put E in position 2 (new spot for E).
- Need two more letters that are NOT S, T, R, Y. Let’s pick common ones like N and D.

Candidate word: L E A N D → “LEAND” (not a valid English word).
Try swapping: L E A N _ → “LEANE” (invalid).
Try “LEMON” – contains M, O (both fresh), positions:
- L in 1 (allowed)
- E in 2 (allowed)
- M in 3 (new letter)
- O in 4 (new letter)
- N in 5 (new letter)

Let’s gather every constraint we have so far.

Letters we know are in the word: L, A, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, T, R, Y, O, N, M, P

Position constraints:

- L:  
  – NOT in 2 (from SLATE)  
  – NOT in 4 (from EARLY)  
  – NOT in 1 (from LEMON)  
  – NOT in 5 (from APEEL)  
  ⇒ L must be in position 3.

- A:  
  – NOT in 3 (from SLATE)  
  – NOT in 2 (from EARLY)  
  – NOT in 1 (from APEEL)  
  ⇒ A can be in 4 or 5.

- E:  
  – NOT in 5 (from SLATE)  
  – NOT in 1 (from EARLY)  
  – NOT in 2 (from LEMON)  
  – NOT in 3 (from APEEL)  
  ⇒ E must be in position 4.

So the word skeleton is: _ _ L E _

We need one more letter (in position 1 or 2) that is:
- NOT any of the forbidden letters (S,T,R,Y,O,N,M,P)  
- NOT any of L,A,E (already used)  
- Must be a valid English word.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word matching the pattern _ _ L E _.

Let’s list possibilities:

- B:  B I L E ?  – no valid word  
- C:  C H I L E  – valid word “CHILE”  
- D:  D I L E ?  – no valid word  
- F:  F I L E ?  – no valid word  
- G:  G I L E ?  – no valid word  
- H:  H I L E ?  – no valid word  
- I:  I _ L E _  – “I” in position 1 or 2  
- K:  K I L E ?  – no valid word  
- U:  U _ L E _  – no valid word  
- V:  V I L E ?  – no valid word  
- W:  W I L E ?  – no valid word  
- X:  X I L E ?  – no valid word  
- Z:  Z I L E ?  – no valid word  

The only valid word fitting the pattern is “CHILE”:
- C and H are new letters, not forbidden.  
- Positions: C(1), H(2), L(3), E(4), I(5) – but wait, our skeleton is _ _ L E _ (positions 3 and 4 fixed as L and E). So “CHILE” would be C H I L E, which fits _ _ L E _.

Let me check:
- C: new, allowed  
- H: new, allowed  
- I: new, allowed (but we only need two new letters total, and we already have C and H)  
- L: must be in 3 – correct  
- E: must be in 4 – correct  

“CHILE” is a valid 5-letter word and satisfies every constraint.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should have frequently used letters in English like A, E, T, R, S, O, L, N, etc.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to maximize information gain from the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S (x) – not in the word at all  
- L (-) – in the word, but not in position 2  
- A (-) – in the word, but not in position 3  
- T (x) – not in the word  
- E (-) – in the word, but not in position 5  

So the secret word:
- contains L, A, E  
- does NOT contain S or T  
- L is not in position 2, A is not in position 3, E is not in position 5  

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- uses L, A, E (in different positions)  
- avoids S and T  
- places L, A, E in positions they haven’t been tried in yet  

Good candidate letters to test next: R, N, I, C, O, D, etc.  
Let’s try a word that shifts L, A, E to new positions and adds new common letters.  
“REAL” is only 4 letters, so we need a 5-letter word.  
“EARLY” has E in position 1 (new), A in 2 (new), R (new), L in 4 (new), Y (new).  
But we already know L is in the word (from feedback), so “EARLY” is valid because it contains L, A, E.  

However, “EARLY” has L in position 4, which hasn’t been tested yet, and shifts A to position 2 and E to position 1.  
This seems like a good next guess to gather more information.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (SLATE):
- S, T are NOT in the word.
- L, A, E ARE in the word, but each in the wrong positions (positions 2, 3, 5 respectively).

From Guess 2 (EARLY):
- E is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- R is NOT in the word.
- L is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- Y is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains exactly the letters L, A, E (and three other letters that are NOT S, T, R, Y).
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 4.
- A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
- E cannot be in positions 1 or 5.

Good remaining consonants to test: N, D, C, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: O, I, U (since A and E are already confirmed).

Let’s try to place L, A, E in new positions and fill the remaining two spots with fresh common letters that haven’t been ruled out.

Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 5
Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 2, 3, 4

Let’s construct a word:
- Put L in position 1 (new spot for L).
- Put A in position 4 (new spot for A).
- Put E in position 2 (new spot for E).
- Need two more letters that are NOT S, T, R, Y. Let’s pick common ones like N and D.

Candidate word: L E A N D → “LEAND” (not a valid English word).
Try swapping: L E A N _ → “LEANE” (invalid).
Try “LEMON” – contains M, O (both fresh), positions:
- L in 1 (allowed)
- E in 2 (allowed)
- M in 3 (new letter)
- O in 4 (new letter)
- N in 5 (new letter)

“LEMON” is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.

Let’s tabulate everything we know so far.

Letters we are certain are in the word: L, A, E  
Letters we are certain are NOT in the word: S, T, R, Y, O, N, M

Positions ruled out for each of the three known letters:

- L: not in 2, 4, 1 (from SLATE, EARLY, LEMON)  
  ⇒ L can only be in position 3 or 5.

- A: not in 3, 2 (from SLATE, EARLY)  
  ⇒ A can be in 1, 4, 5.

- E: not in 5, 1, 2 (from SLATE, EARLY, LEMON)  
  ⇒ E can be in 3 or 4.

Also, the word must contain exactly the letters L, A, E plus two fresh letters that are not among the forbidden set {S,T,R,Y,O,N,M}.  
Common unused consonants: D, G, H, K, P, B, C, F, etc.  
Unused vowels: I, U.

We need a valid 5-letter word that uses L, A, E in permissible positions and two new letters.

Let’s try to build a candidate:

Place E in position 3 (allowed).  
Place L in position 5 (allowed).  
Place A in position 4 (allowed).  
We now have: _ _ E A L

We need two new letters for positions 1 and 2.  
Pick common ones: D and I.

Candidate: D I E A L → “DIEAL” (invalid).  
Swap to “DIALE” (invalid).  
Swap to “IELD A” (invalid).  
Try “DEIAL” (invalid).

Instead, let’s place E in position 4 and L in position 3:

Word skeleton: _ _ L E _

Place A in position 1 or 5 (but 5 is open).  
Let’s try A in position 1: A _ L E _

We need a valid word.  
“ALLEY” contains L, E, Y – but Y is forbidden.  
“ALLEY” is invalid.

Try “ALLEG” – G is allowed, but “ALLEG” is not a word.

Try “ALLEP” – not a word.

Try “ALLEB” – not a word.

Try “ALLEK” – not a word.

Try “ALLEF” – not a word.

Try “ALLEH” – not a word.

Try “ALLEI” – not a word.

Try “ALLEK” – not a word.

Let’s try E in position 3 and L in position 5 again:

_ _ E _ L

Place A in position 1: A _ E _ L  
Need a valid word: “AHELP” – not a word.  
“APEEL” – contains P, E, E, L.  
Check positions:  
A(1) – allowed  
P(2) – new letter, allowed  
E(3) – allowed  
E(4) – E can be in 3 or 4 – 4 is allowed  
L(5) – allowed  

“APEEL” is a valid English word and fits all constraints.

Let me double-check:
- Letters used: A, P, E, E, L  
  – Contains L, A, E (required).  
  – P is new and allowed.  
  – No forbidden letters.  
  – Positions:  
      A(1) – allowed (positions for A: 1,4,5)  
      P(2) – new letter  
      E(3) – allowed (positions for E: 3,4)  
      E(4) – allowed

Let’s gather every constraint we have so far.

Letters we know are in the word: L, A, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, T, R, Y, O, N, M, P

Position constraints:

- L:  
  – NOT in 2 (from SLATE)  
  – NOT in 4 (from EARLY)  
  – NOT in 1 (from LEMON)  
  – NOT in 5 (from APEEL)  
  ⇒ L must be in position 3.

- A:  
  – NOT in 3 (from SLATE)  
  – NOT in 2 (from EARLY)  
  – NOT in 1 (from APEEL)  
  ⇒ A can be in 4 or 5.

- E:  
  – NOT in 5 (from SLATE)  
  – NOT in 1 (from EARLY)  
  – NOT in 2 (from LEMON)  
  – NOT in 3 (from APEEL)  
  ⇒ E must be in position 4.

So the word skeleton is: _ _ L E _

We need one more letter (in position 1 or 2) that is:
- NOT any of the forbidden letters (S,T,R,Y,O,N,M,P)  
- NOT any of L,A,E (already used)  
- Must be a valid English word.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word matching the pattern _ _ L E _.

Let’s list possibilities:

- B:  B I L E ?  – no valid word  
- C:  C H I L E  – valid word “CHILE”  
- D:  D I L E ?  – no valid word  
- F:  F I L E ?  – no valid word  
- G:  G I L E ?  – no valid word  
- H:  H I L E ?  – no valid word  
- I:  I _ L E _  – “I” in position 1 or 2  
- K:  K I L E ?  – no valid word  
- U:  U _ L E _  – no valid word  
- V:  V I L E ?  – no valid word  
- W:  W I L E ?  – no valid word  
- X:  X I L E ?  – no valid word  
- Z:  Z I L E ?  – no valid word  

The only valid word fitting the pattern is “CHILE”:
- C and H are new letters, not forbidden.  
- Positions: C(1), H(2), L(3), E(4), I(5) – but wait, our skeleton is _ _ L E _ (positions 3 and 4 fixed as L and E). So “CHILE” would be C H I L E, which fits _ _ L E _.

Let me check:
- C: new, allowed  
- H: new, allowed  
- I: new, allowed (but we only need two new letters total, and we already have C and H)  
- L: must be in 3 – correct  
- E: must be in 4 – correct  

“CHILE” is a valid 5-letter word and satisfies every constraint.

Let’s update the constraints after the fifth guess.

Letters we know are in the word: L, A, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, T, R, Y, O, N, M, P, C, H, I

Position constraints:

- L:  
  – NOT in 2, 4, 1, 5 (from SLATE, EARLY, LEMON, APEEL, CHILE)  
  ⇒ L has no permissible positions left. This is impossible.

Wait, let’s recheck the position feedback carefully:

Guess 5: CHILE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(x) L(-) E(-)

- L is in the word but NOT in position 4 (the “-” in position 4 means it’s in the word but wrong position).  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (the “-” in position 5 means it’s in the word but wrong position).

So the constraints are:

- L: NOT in 2, 4, 1, 5 (from SLATE, EARLY, LEMON, APEEL, CHILE)  
  ⇒ L must be in position 3.

- E: NOT in 5, 1, 2, 5 (from SLATE, EARLY, LEMON, APEEL, CHILE)  
  ⇒ E must be in position 4.

- A: NOT in 3, 2, 1 (from SLATE, EARLY, APEEL)  
  ⇒ A can be in 5.

So the skeleton is: _ _ L E A

We need two new letters for positions 1 and 2 that are not among the forbidden set (S,T,R,Y,O,N,M,P,C,H,I).

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form _ _ L E A.

Let’s list possibilities:

- B:  B U L E A – invalid  
- B:  B O L E A – O forbidden  
- D:  D U L E A – invalid  
- F:  F U L E A – invalid  
- G:  G U L E A – invalid  
- J:  J U L E A – invalid  
- K:  K U L E A – invalid  
- Q:  Q U L E A – invalid  
- U:  U B L E A – invalid  
- V:  V I L E A – I forbidden  
- W:  W I L E A – I forbidden  
- X:  X I L E A – I forbidden  
- Z:  Z I L E A – I forbidden  

Wait, let’s try real words:

- “BULLE” – no  
- “GUELA” – no  
- “VILLA” – no  
- “JULEA” – no  
- “DULEA” – no  

The only valid English word matching _ _ L E A is “FUGLE” (a type of bird), but that contains U, G, L, E – but we need two new letters for positions 1 and 2.

Actually, the valid word is “FUGLE” – but let’s check:

F U G L E – positions: 1=F, 2=U, 3=G, 4=L, 5=E. Doesn’t fit _ _ L E A.

Let’s try “JULEA” – J U L E A: positions 1=J, 2=U, 3=L, 4=E, 5=A. This fits the skeleton _ _ L E A and uses new letters J and U.

“JULEA” is a valid 5-letter word (though uncommon, it’s recognized in some dictionaries).

Let’s verify constraints:

- Letters used: J, U, L, E, A  
  – Contains L, A, E (required)  
  – J and U are new, not forbidden  
  – No forbidden letters  

- Positions:  
  – L is in 3 (required)  
  – E is in 4 (required)  
  – A is in 5 (allowed)  

“JULEA” satisfies all constraints.

Letters we know are in the word: L, A, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, T, R, Y, O, N, M, P, C, H, I

Position constraints:

- L:

Wait, let’s recheck the position feedback carefully:

Guess 5: CHILE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(x) L(-) E(-)

- L is in the word but NOT in position 4 (the “-” in position 4 means it’s in the word but wrong position).  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (the “-” in position 5 means it’s in the word but wrong position).

So the constraints are:

- L: NOT in 2, 4, 1, 5 (from SLATE, EARLY, LEMON, APEEL, CHILE)  
  ⇒ L must be in position 3.

- E: NOT in 5, 1, 2, 5 (from SLATE, EARLY, LEMON, APEEL, CHILE)  
  ⇒ E must be in position 4.

- A: NOT in 3, 2, 1 (from SLATE, EARLY, APEEL)  
  ⇒ A can be in 5.

So the skeleton is: _ _ L E A

We need two new letters for positions 1 and 2 that are not among the forbidden set (S,T,R,Y,O,N,M,P,C,H,I).

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form _ _ L E A.

Let’s list possibilities:

- B:  B U L E A – invalid
