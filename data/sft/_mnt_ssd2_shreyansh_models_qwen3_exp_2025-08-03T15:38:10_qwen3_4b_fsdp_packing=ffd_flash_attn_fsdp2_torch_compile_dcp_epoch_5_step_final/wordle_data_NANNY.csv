For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers as many vowels and consonants as possible to maximize information gain. A good starting word often contains common vowels like A, E, I and common consonants like R, T, N, S. 

Some popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

Among these, ""ARISE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Let me go with ""ARISE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on ARISE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is somewhere in the secret word, but not in position 1)
- R, I, S, E are not in the word at all.

That tells us:
1. The secret word contains an A, but not in slot 1.
2. The remaining four letters are chosen from the other 21 letters of the alphabet (excluding R, I, S, E).

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes A (but not in position 1)
- Does NOT include R, I, S, E
- Uses letters that haven’t been ruled out yet.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels left: O, U (since A is already known and E, I are out).

Let’s aim for a word that places A in a different slot and uses new consonants and possibly O or U.

A word like “PLAID” would use P, L, A, I, D – but I is already ruled out.
“COULD” uses C, O, U, L, D – no A, but covers new letters.
“MOUNT” uses M, O, U, N, T – again no A.
“CLOUD” uses C, L, O, U, D – no A.
“ABOUT” uses A, B, O, U, T – includes A and new letters.

“ABOUT” has A in position 2, and uses B, O, U, T – none of which have been ruled out. This seems like a good second guess to gather more information.

- PLAIN (P, L, A, I, N) – I is ruled out.
- GLEAN (G, L, E, A, N) – E is ruled out.
- FLANK (F, L, A, N, K) – F and K are acceptable.
- GLAND (G, L, A, N, D) – all letters are still possible.

Another check: A is allowed in position 3 (it was only marked “-” in positions 1 and 2 in previous guesses, so positions 3-5 are still open).

“GLAND” seems good: it places A in position 3, uses common letters G, L, N, D, and none of the ruled-out letters.

Another check: A is allowed in position 3 (it was only marked “-” in positions 1 and 2 in previous guesses, so positions 3-5 are still open).

So, “GLAND” is a strong next guess.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers as many vowels and consonants as possible to maximize information gain. A good starting word often contains common vowels like A, E, I and common consonants like R, T, N, S. 

Some popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

Among these, ""ARISE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Let me go with ""ARISE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is somewhere in the secret word, but not in position 1)
- R, I, S, E are not in the word at all.

That tells us:
1. The secret word contains an A, but not in slot 1.
2. The remaining four letters are chosen from the other 21 letters of the alphabet (excluding R, I, S, E).

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes A (but not in position 1)
- Does NOT include R, I, S, E
- Uses letters that haven’t been ruled out yet.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels left: O, U (since A is already known and E, I are out).

Let’s aim for a word that places A in a different slot and uses new consonants and possibly O or U.

A word like “PLAID” would use P, L, A, I, D – but I is already ruled out.
“COULD” uses C, O, U, L, D – no A, but covers new letters.
“MOUNT” uses M, O, U, N, T – again no A.
“CLOUD” uses C, L, O, U, D – no A.
“ABOUT” uses A, B, O, U, T – includes A and new letters.

“ABOUT” has A in position 2, and uses B, O, U, T – none of which have been ruled out. This seems like a good second guess to gather more information.

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S, E, B, O, U, T  
Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): A  
Remaining unused common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining unused vowels: none except A (since O, U, E, I are out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains the letter A (but not in position 1 or 2, since A appeared “-” in both guesses at positions 1 and 2).
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no R, I, S, E, B, O, U, T).

Possible placements for A: positions 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s try to pick a word that places A in position 3 and uses common remaining letters like N, L, C, D, M, P, G, H.

Some candidates:
- CHALK (C, H, A, L, K) – but K is less common.
- PLAIN (P, L, A, I, N) – I is ruled out.
- GLEAN (G, L, E, A, N) – E is ruled out.
- FLANK (F, L, A, N, K) – F and K are acceptable.
- GLAND (G, L, A, N, D) – all letters are still possible.

“GLAND” seems good: it places A in position 3, uses common letters G, L, N, D, and none of the ruled-out letters.

Another check: A is allowed in position 3 (it was only marked “-” in positions 1 and 2 in previous guesses, so positions 3-5 are still open).

So, “GLAND” is a strong next guess.

   - A appears in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (it was “-” in 1, then “✓” in 2, “✓” in 3, “✓” in 4, and “-” in 5).  
     Therefore A is in the word and must be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since it was “-” in 1 and “-” in 5).  
   - N appears in positions 3, 4, or 5 (it was “-” in 3, “✓” in 4, and “✓” in 5).  
     Therefore N is in the word and must be in positions 4 or 5 (since it was “✓” in 4 and “✓” in 5).

3. Current pattern constraints:
   - A must be in position 2, 3, or 4.  
   - N must be in position 4 or 5.  
   - No repeated letters are forced yet, but we can look for common patterns.

4. Remaining possible letters (not yet ruled out):
   C, F, H, J, K, P, V, W, Y, plus A and N which we know are present.

5. Let’s test possible positions:
   - If A is in position 2: word pattern is _ A _ _ _  
     Then N must be in 4 or 5: _ A _ N _ or _ A _ _ N  
     Possible words: CANNY (but Y is allowed), FANNY, HANNY, PANNY, etc.  
     CANNY is a valid word.

   - If A is in position 3: word pattern is _ _ A _ _  
     Then N must be in 4 or 5: _ _ A N _ or _ _ A _ N  
     Possible words: CAVAN (not valid), FAVAN (not valid), HAVAN (not valid), etc.  
     None obvious.

   - If A is in position 4: word pattern is _ _ _ A _  
     Then N must be in 5: _ _ _ A N  
     Possible words: CAFAN (not valid), FAFAN (not valid), HAFAN (not valid), etc.  
     None obvious.

6. The only valid word fitting the constraints is CANNY (pattern _ A _ N _ with N in 4 and A in 2).

Let’s verify:
- CANNY: C, A, N, N, Y  
  - Letters used: C, A, N, N, Y – none are in the banned list.  
  - A is in position 2 (allowed).  
  - N is in positions 3 and 4 – but we know N must be in 4 or 5, so this fits.  
  - Y is a new letter we haven’t tested yet, which is fine.

Therefore CANNY is the best next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers as many vowels and consonants as possible to maximize information gain. A good starting word often contains common vowels like A, E, I and common consonants like R, T, N, S. 

Some popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

Among these, ""ARISE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Let me go with ""ARISE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is somewhere in the secret word, but not in position 1)
- R, I, S, E are not in the word at all.

That tells us:
1. The secret word contains an A, but not in slot 1.
2. The remaining four letters are chosen from the other 21 letters of the alphabet (excluding R, I, S, E).

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes A (but not in position 1)
- Does NOT include R, I, S, E
- Uses letters that haven’t been ruled out yet.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good vowels left: O, U (since A is already known and E, I are out).

Let’s aim for a word that places A in a different slot and uses new consonants and possibly O or U.

A word like “PLAID” would use P, L, A, I, D – but I is already ruled out.
“COULD” uses C, O, U, L, D – no A, but covers new letters.
“MOUNT” uses M, O, U, N, T – again no A.
“CLOUD” uses C, L, O, U, D – no A.
“ABOUT” uses A, B, O, U, T – includes A and new letters.

“ABOUT” has A in position 2, and uses B, O, U, T – none of which have been ruled out. This seems like a good second guess to gather more information.

Guess 2: ABOUT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(x)

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S, E, B, O, U, T  
Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): A  
Remaining unused common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining unused vowels: none except A (since O, U, E, I are out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains the letter A (but not in position 1 or 2, since A appeared “-” in both guesses at positions 1 and 2).
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool (no R, I, S, E, B, O, U, T).

Possible placements for A: positions 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s try to pick a word that places A in position 3 and uses common remaining letters like N, L, C, D, M, P, G, H.

Some candidates:
- CHALK (C, H, A, L, K) – but K is less common.
- PLAIN (P, L, A, I, N) – I is ruled out.
- GLEAN (G, L, E, A, N) – E is ruled out.
- FLANK (F, L, A, N, K) – F and K are acceptable.
- GLAND (G, L, A, N, D) – all letters are still possible.

“GLAND” seems good: it places A in position 3, uses common letters G, L, N, D, and none of the ruled-out letters.

Another check: A is allowed in position 3 (it was only marked “-” in positions 1 and 2 in previous guesses, so positions 3-5 are still open).

So, “GLAND” is a strong next guess.

Current facts:
1. Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S, E, B, O, U, T, G, L, D  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: A, N  
   - A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (it was “-” in positions 1, 2, and now 3).  
   - N is in the word AND is in position 4 (feedback “✓” in GLAND at position 4).  
3. Remaining possible letters (common ones): C, F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
4. Word pattern so far: _ _ _ N _  
   - A must appear somewhere in positions 4 or 5, but position 4 is already N.  
   - Therefore A must be in position 5.  
   - So the word ends in A N.  

Pattern: _ _ _ N A  
We need a 5-letter word that ends in “-NA” and uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates:
- CHINA – but I is ruled out.  
- PHANA – not a valid English word.  
- WHANA – not valid.  
- HAKNA – not valid.  
- KANNA – not valid.  
- MANNA – uses M, A, N, N, A. A and N are allowed, but double N may or may not be the case.  
- CANNA – uses C, A, N, N, A. Also possible.  

Between MANNA and CANNA, both fit the pattern and constraints.  
MANNAs are valid English plural nouns (short for “mankind” or “man”).  
CANNAs are slang for cannabis, but not standard dictionary words.  

Thus MANNA is safer.

Let’s verify:
- Letters: M, A, N, N, A  
- None of R, I, S, E, B, O, U, T, G, L, D appear.  
- A is in position 5 (allowed).  
- N is in position 4 (matches ✓).  

Therefore MANNA is a valid next guess.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after four guesses.

1. Letters NOT in the word (x feedback):
   R, I, S, E, B, O, U, T, G, L, D, M

2. Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or – feedback):
   - A appears in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (it was “-” in 1, then “✓” in 2, “✓” in 3, “✓” in 4, and “-” in 5).  
     Therefore A is in the word and must be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since it was “-” in 1 and “-” in 5).  
   - N appears in positions 3, 4, or 5 (it was “-” in 3, “✓” in 4, and “✓” in 5).  
     Therefore N is in the word and must be in positions 4 or 5 (since it was “✓” in 4 and “✓” in 5).

3. Current pattern constraints:
   - A must be in position 2, 3, or 4.  
   - N must be in position 4 or 5.  
   - No repeated letters are forced yet, but we can look for common patterns.

4. Remaining possible letters (not yet ruled out):
   C, F, H, J, K, P, V, W, Y, plus A and N which we know are present.

5. Let’s test possible positions:
   - If A is in position 2: word pattern is _ A _ _ _  
     Then N must be in 4 or 5: _ A _ N _ or _ A _ _ N  
     Possible words: CANNY (but Y is allowed), FANNY, HANNY, PANNY, etc.  
     CANNY is a valid word.

   - If A is in position 3: word pattern is _ _ A _ _  
     Then N must be in 4 or 5: _ _ A N _ or _ _ A _ N  
     Possible words: CAVAN (not valid), FAVAN (not valid), HAVAN (not valid), etc.  
     None obvious.

   - If A is in position 4: word pattern is _ _ _ A _  
     Then N must be in 5: _ _ _ A N  
     Possible words: CAFAN (not valid), FAFAN (not valid), HAFAN (not valid), etc.  
     None obvious.

6. The only valid word fitting the constraints is CANNY (pattern _ A _ N _ with N in 4 and A in 2).

Let’s verify:
- CANNY: C, A, N, N, Y  
  - Letters used: C, A, N, N, Y – none are in the banned list.  
  - A is in position 2 (allowed).  
  - N is in positions 3 and 4 – but we know N must be in 4 or 5, so this fits.  
  - Y is a new letter we haven’t tested yet, which is fine.

Therefore CANNY is the best next guess.

Let’s test possible positions:\n   - If A is in position 2: word pattern is _ A _ _ _  \n     Then N must be in 4 or 5: _ A _ N _ or _ A _ _ N  \n     Possible words: CANNY (but Y is allowed), FANNY, HANNY, PANNY, etc.  \n     CANNY is a valid word.\n\n   - If A is in position 3: word pattern is _ _ A _ _  \n     Then N must be in 4 or 5: _ _ A N _ or _ _ A _ N  \n     Possible words: CAVAN (not valid), FAVAN (not valid), HAVAN (not valid), etc.  \n     None obvious.\n\n   - If A is in position 4: word pattern is _ _ _ A _  \n     Then N must be in 5: _ _ _ A N  \n     Possible words: CAFAN (not valid), FAFAN (not valid), HAFAN (not valid), etc.  \n     None obvious.\n\n6. The only valid word fitting the constraints is CANNY (pattern _ A _ N _ with N in 4 and A in 2).\n\nLet’s verify:\n- CANNY: C, A, N, N, Y  \n  - Letters used: C, A, N, N, Y – none are in the banned list.  \n  - A is in position 2 (allowed).  \n  - N is in positions 3 and 4 – but we know N must be in 4 or 5, so this fits.  \n  - Y is a new letter we haven’t tested yet, which is fine.\n\nTherefore CANNY is the best next guess.\n\n<guess>CANNY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ABOUT -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(x) O(x) U(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: GLAND -> FEEDBACK: G(x) L(x) A(-) N(✓) D(x)\nGuess 4: MANNA -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) N(✓) N(✓) A(-)\nGuess 5: CANNY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) N(✓) N(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the five rounds we now have:

Letters NOT in the word:  
R, I, S, E, B, O, U, T, G, L, D, M, C

Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
- A is in position 2 (✓ in CANNY)
- N is in position 3 (✓ in CANNY)
- N is also in position 4 (✓ in CANNY)
- Y is in position 5 (✓ in CANNY)

This implies the word has the pattern:  
_ A N N Y

The only letter missing is the first one.  
From remaining unused letters (F, H, J, K, P, V, W), the only common 5-letter word that fits is:

F A N N Y → FANNY

All letters are allowed and the pattern matches.
