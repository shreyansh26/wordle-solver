### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common letters to test multiple possibilities at once.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, maximizing information gain

This will give us good coverage of common letters and positions to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

Since S and E are in the word, I need a new word that contains both S and E, but not in the positions they occupied in AROSE (S in 4th, E in 5th). Also, I should avoid A, R, O entirely.

A good next step is to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are I and U, and common consonants include T, N, L, D, etc. I’ll look for a word that places S and E in new positions and introduces other frequent letters.

One strong candidate is ""STILE"":
- S moves to 1st position (new position).
- E moves to 4th position (new position).
- Introduces T, I, L — all common letters not yet tested.
- Avoids A, R, O as required.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common letters to test multiple possibilities at once.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, maximizing information gain

This will give us good coverage of common letters and positions to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

Since S and E are in the word, I need a new word that contains both S and E, but not in the positions they occupied in AROSE (S in 4th, E in 5th). Also, I should avoid A, R, O entirely.

A good next step is to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining vowels are I and U, and common consonants include T, N, L, D, etc. I’ll look for a word that places S and E in new positions and introduces other frequent letters.

One strong candidate is ""STILE"":

- Starts with S (✓).
- Contains E in 3rd position (new position).
- Uses C and N, both common and not ruled out.
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, T, I, L).

Let’s try SCENE.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: stile -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) I(x) L(x) E(-)
Guess 3: scene -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(-) E(✓) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's digest the latest feedback:

1. S is locked in the 1st position (✓).
2. E is in the word and is already correctly placed at 3rd position (✓).  
   So the word looks like: S _ E _ _
3. C is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
4. N is NOT in the word (x).
5. Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, T, I, L, N.

We still need to place:
- C somewhere other than 2nd position (since it was in 2nd in scene and marked wrong position).
- We know nothing about the 4th and 5th letters yet.

Remaining common letters to test: D, U, M, P, G, H, B, F, K, Y, etc.

Possible patterns:
- S _ E _ _
- C must appear in 4th or 5th position (since 2nd is excluded).

Let's try to form valid words:
- S C E _ _ → SCE__ – no common 5-letter words start with SCE.
- S _ E C _ → S E C _ – ""SECK_"" – no.
- S _ E _ C → S _ E _ C – possible words: S U E D C? No. S H E L C? No.
- S _ E C _ – ""S P E C _"" → SPECK? But K is allowed and P is common. Let's check:
   SPECK:
   - S ✓, P ?, E ✓, C in 4th (new position), K ?.
   - Uses P and K which are still allowed.
   - No forbidden letters.

Another candidate: SHELC? No, L is forbidden.
Another: S P E C K – SPECK is valid.

Let's go with SPECK.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: stile -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) I(x) L(x) E(-)
Guess 3: scene -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(-) E(✓) N(x) E(-)
Guess 4: speak -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(✓) E(✓) A(x) K(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback on SPEAK:
- S(✓) – correct in 1st position.
- P(✓) – correct in 2nd position.
- E(✓) – correct in 3rd position.
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- K(✓) – correct in 5th position.

So the word pattern is now fully determined:
S P E _ K

We only need to find the 4th letter.  
Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, T, I, L, N.  
Allowed letters for the 4th position: any letter not in that forbidden set and not already used (P, S, E, K are already used).

Common remaining consonants: D, U, M, G, H, B, F, C, Y, etc.

Valid 5-letter words matching S P E _ K:
- SPECK (but C was already ruled out when it appeared in 2nd position in scene, yet we haven’t seen evidence against C yet)
- SPEIK? Not a valid word.
- SPEUK? Not valid.
- SPEHK? Not valid.
- SPEBK? Not valid.
- SPEFK? Not valid.
- SPECK is the only common word left, and C hasn’t been proven wrong yet.

However, in scene, C was in 2nd position and marked wrong position (-), but that doesn’t preclude it from 4th position.  
Let’s check SPECK against all feedback:
- arose: A(x), R(x), O(x), S(-), E(-) – OK, S and E are in word but wrong positions.
- stile: S(✓), T(x), I(x), L(x), E(-) – OK, S locked, E in word but wrong positions.
- scene: S(✓), C(-), E(✓), N(x), E(-) – OK, C is in word but wrong position (now it’s 3rd, which is correct, so this would contradict).
Wait, in scene, C was in 2nd position and marked (-), meaning C is in word but not 2nd. If in SPECK, C is 4th, that’s allowed. The feedback for scene would still hold.

But let’s look for any other possible letters.  
Another valid word: SPEIK? Not a word.  
SPECK seems to be the only common valid word fitting S P E _ K.

Therefore, the word must be SPECK.
