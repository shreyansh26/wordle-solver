### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, S, L). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, maximizing information gain

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the two guesses so far:

- Letters known to be in the word and in the correct positions:  
  – I in position 4  
  – L in position 5  

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ I L

Letters still allowed (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the vowels we’ve already ruled out, so only remaining vowels are none (all vowels except I have been ruled out).  
We need three more consonants to fill positions 1, 2, 3.

A good next word would use common consonants in these positions while avoiding all the eliminated letters.  
Let’s try “DITCH”:

- D, I, T, C, H  
- I is in position 4 (✓)  
- L is in position 5 (✓)  
- D, C, H are new letters and not eliminated.  
- T was already eliminated in Guess 2, so “DITCH” is invalid because it contains T.

Next try “MILCH”:

- I in 4, L in 5 (✓)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, S, L). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, maximizing information gain

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

All five letters in ""arose"" (A, R, O, S, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means the secret word contains none of those letters.  
To maximize information, I should now pick a word that avoids all of them and still uses common letters.  
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are ruled out).

A strong second guess is “UNTIL” because it:
- Uses two new vowels (U, I)  
- Uses three common consonants (N, T, L)  
- Avoids all letters already eliminated (A, R, O, S, E)  
- Has no repeated letters

From the two guesses so far:

- Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T  
- Letters known to be in the word and in the correct positions:  
  – I in position 4  
  – L in position 5  

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ I L

Letters still allowed (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the vowels we’ve already ruled out, so only remaining vowels are none (all vowels except I have been ruled out).  
We need three more consonants to fill positions 1, 2, 3.

A good next word would use common consonants in these positions while avoiding all the eliminated letters.  
Let’s try “DITCH”:

- D, I, T, C, H  
- I is in position 4 (✓)  
- L is in position 5 (✓)  
- D, C, H are new letters and not eliminated.  
- T was already eliminated in Guess 2, so “DITCH” is invalid because it contains T.

Next try “MILCH”:

- M, I, L, C, H  
- I in 4, L in 5 (✓)  
- M, C, H are new and allowed.  
- No eliminated letters.  
- It fits the pattern _ _ _ I L.

Let’s go with “MILCH”.

B, D, G, J, P, V, W, plus any vowels except A, O, E (but all vowels except I have been ruled out), so no other vowels left.

We need three more consonants (positions 1, 2, 5) with L in one of 1, 2, 3.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns:

1. L _ _ I _  
   - L B I D ? – no common word  
   - L I is not possible (I is in 4)  
   - L _ _ I _ : “LIVID” – V, D allowed, but I is already in 4, so no second I.  
   - “LUMPY” – M, P, Y ruled out.  
   - “LIVOR” – O, R ruled out.  
   - “LIGAN” – A, N ruled out.  
   - No obvious common word here.

2. _ L _ I _  
   - “BLIND” – N ruled out.  
   - “PLUMB” – M ruled out.  
   - “GLIB” – too short.  
   - “VALID” – A ruled out.  
   - “WILDS” – S ruled out.  
   - “WIELD” – E ruled out.  
   - “WILLY” – Y ruled out.  
   - “BULLI” – not a word.  
   - “GULLI” – not a word.  
   - “PILCH” – C, H ruled out.  
   - “DILLY” – D, Y allowed, but second L would be in 3, I in 4, so “DILLY” is D I L L Y – but L appears twice, once in 3 (allowed) and once in 5 (disallowed), so invalid.  
   - “DILLY” is invalid because L cannot be in 5.

3. _ _ L I _  
   - “BILLI” – not a word.  
   - “GILTI” – not a word.  
   - “WILDS” – S ruled out.  
   - “VILLA” – A, L twice, but A ruled out.  
   - “WILLY” – Y ruled out.  
   - “DILLY” already considered.  
   - “PILCH” – C, H ruled out.  
   - “FILMY” – F, M, Y ruled out.  
   - “GILLY” – G, Y allowed, but second L in 3 and Y in 5, so “GILLY” is G I L L Y – L in 3 is allowed, but Y in 5 is allowed, and no banned letters.  
   - Check “GILLY”: G, I, L, L, Y – all letters are allowed (none in the banned list), L appears in 3 (allowed), I in 4 (correct), and it’s a valid word.

Therefore, “GILLY” is the best next guess.",Guess 5: gilly -> FEEDBACK: G(-) I(✓) L(-) L(-) Y(x),FAIL

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, S, L). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, maximizing information gain

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

All five letters in ""arose"" (A, R, O, S, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means the secret word contains none of those letters.  
To maximize information, I should now pick a word that avoids all of them and still uses common letters.  
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O, E are ruled out).

A strong second guess is “UNTIL” because it:
- Uses two new vowels (U, I)  
- Uses three common consonants (N, T, L)  
- Avoids all letters already eliminated (A, R, O, S, E)  
- Has no repeated letters

From the two guesses so far:

- Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T  
- Letters known to be in the word and in the correct positions:  
  – I in position 4  
  – L in position 5  

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ I L

Letters still allowed (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the vowels we’ve already ruled out, so only remaining vowels are none (all vowels except I have been ruled out).  
We need three more consonants to fill positions 1, 2, 3.

A good next word would use common consonants in these positions while avoiding all the eliminated letters.  
Let’s try “DITCH”:

- D, I, T, C, H  
- I is in position 4 (✓)  
- L is in position 5 (✓)  
- D, C, H are new letters and not eliminated.  
- T was already eliminated in Guess 2, so “DITCH” is invalid because it contains T.

Next try “MILCH”:

- M, I, L, C, H  
- I in 4, L in 5 (✓)  
- M, C, H are new and allowed.  
- No eliminated letters.  
- It fits the pattern _ _ _ I L.

Let’s go with “MILCH”.

From the three guesses so far:

- Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, M, C, H  
- Letters known to be in the word:  
  – I in position 4 (✓)  
  – L in the word but NOT in position 5 (from Guess 3: L(-))  

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ I _ and L must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Letters still allowed (common ones): B, D, F, G, J, K, P, V, W, Y, plus any vowels except A, O, E (since I is already placed at 4 and U is ruled out). All vowels except I have been eliminated, so no more vowels to place.

We need three letters for positions 1, 2, 3, with L somewhere in those three positions, and I already fixed at 4.

Possible structure: L _ _ I _ or _ L _ I _ or _ _ L I _

Let’s look for common 5-letter words that fit _ _ _ I _ with L in positions 1, 2, or 3, using only allowed letters.

One candidate: “FILLY” – but Y is allowed, but L is in position 5 which we know is wrong.  
Another: “WILLY” – same issue.  
“BILLI” – not a valid word.  
“GILLI” – not valid.  
“FILMS” – S is eliminated.  
“PILCH” – C and H are eliminated.  
“DILLY” – D, I, L, L, Y – L appears twice, but second L would be in position 4 which is I, so invalid.  
“WIMPY” – M is eliminated.  
“VIRIL” – not common.  
“FILMY” – M is eliminated.  
“DILLY” already considered.  
“GILDO” – O is eliminated.  
“FILKY” – K is allowed, Y is allowed.  
Check “FILKY”: F, I, L, K, Y – all letters are allowed (none in the banned list), L is in position 3 (which is allowed since L must be in 1,2, or 3), I in 4 (correct), and it’s a valid word.

Let’s verify:
- F: new, allowed  
- I: position 4 (✓)  
- L: in word, position 3 (allowed)  
- K: new, allowed  
- Y: new, allowed  

No banned letters are used.  
So “FILKY” is a good next guess.

From all four guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, M, C, H, F, K, Y

Letters confirmed to be in the word:  
- I in position 4  
- L somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3 (because it was marked “-” in positions 3 and 5, so it cannot be in 3 or 5, and from guess 2 it was in 5, so L must be in 1, 2, or 3)

So the pattern is:  
[?] [?] L I [?]  or  [?] L [?] I [?]  or  L [?] [?] I [?]

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):  
B, D, G, J, P, V, W, plus any vowels except A, O, E (but all vowels except I have been ruled out), so no other vowels left.

We need three more consonants (positions 1, 2, 5) with L in one of 1, 2, 3.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns:

1. L _ _ I _  
   - L B I D ? – no common word  
   - L I is not possible (I is in 4)  
   - L _ _ I _ : “LIVID” – V, D allowed, but I is already in 4, so no second I.

   - No obvious common word here.

2. _ L _ I _  
   - “BLIND” – N ruled out.  
   - “PLUMB” – M ruled out.  
   - “GLIB” – too short.  
   - “VALID” – A ruled out.  
   - “WILDS” – S ruled out.  
   - “WIELD” – E ruled out.  
   - “WILLY” – Y ruled out.  
   - “BULLI” – not a word.  
   - “GULLI” – not a word.  
   - “PILCH” – C, H ruled out.  
   - “DILLY” – D, Y allowed, but second L would be in 3, I in 4, so “DILLY” is D I L L Y – but L appears twice, once in 3 (allowed) and once in 5 (disallowed), so invalid.  
   - “DILLY” is invalid because L cannot be in 5.

3. _ _ L I _  
   - “BILLI” – not a word.  
   - “GILTI” – not a word.  
   - “WILDS” – S ruled out.  
   - “VILLA” – A, L twice, but A ruled out.  
   - “WILLY” – Y ruled out.  
   - “DILLY” already considered.  
   - “PILCH” – C, H ruled out.  
   - “FILMY” – F, M, Y ruled out.  
   - “GILLY” – G, Y allowed, but second L in 3 and Y in 5, so “GILLY” is G I L L Y – L in 3 is allowed, but Y in 5 is allowed, and no banned letters.  
   - Check “GILLY”: G, I, L, L, Y – all letters are allowed (none in the banned list), L appears in 3 (allowed), I in 4 (correct), and it’s a valid word.

Therefore, “GILLY” is the best next guess.

From the five guesses we now have:

Letters NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, M, C, H, F, K, Y

Letters confirmed to be in the word:  
- I in position 4 (✓)  
- L must appear somewhere, but it has been marked “-” in positions 3, 5, and 2 (from guesses 3, 5, 2 respectively).  
  Therefore L cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5.  
  From guess 2 (until) we also know L was not in position 5 (it was marked ✓), so L must be in position 1.

So the pattern is:  
L _ _ I _

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):  
B, D, G, J, P, V, W, plus any vowels except A, O, E (but all vowels except I have been ruled out), so no other vowels left.

We need two more consonants for positions 2 and 5, chosen from the allowed list.

Possible valid 5-letter words fitting L _ _ I _:

- L I is fixed in positions 1 and 4.  
- Position 2 and 5 must be filled with allowed consonants.

Looking at common words:
- L I D I ? – no common word.  
- L I G I ? – no.  
- L I V I ? – no.  
- L I P I ? – no.  
- L I B I ? – no.  
- L I V I D – 5 letters, but ends in D, and positions are L I V I D – but this has I in 4 and D in 5, which fits: L I V I D.

Check letters: L, I, V, I, D – all allowed (none in banned list), and positions:
- L in 1 (required)  
- I in 4 (correct)  
- V in 2  
- I in 3 (but we already have I in 4; this is allowed because the word can have multiple I’s)  
- D in 5  

However, the word “LIVED” is L I V E D, but E is banned.  
The word “LIVID” is L I V I D – this is actually a valid English word meaning “showing no emotion or interest.”  
All letters L, I, V, I, D are allowed by our constraints.

Therefore, “LIVID” is the logical next guess.

<guess>lived</guess>",lived,"From the five guesses we now have:

Letters NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, M, C, H, F, K, Y

Letters confirmed to be in the word:  
- I in position 4 (✓)  
- L must appear somewhere, but it has been marked “-” in positions 3, 5, and 2 (from guesses 3, 5, 2 respectively).  
  Therefore L cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5.  
  From guess 2 (until) we also know L was not in position 5 (it was marked ✓), so L must be in position 1.

So the pattern is:  
L _ _ I _

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):  
B, D, G, J, P, V, W, plus any vowels except A, O, E (but all vowels except I have been ruled out), so no other vowels left.

We need two more consonants for positions 2 and 5, chosen from the allowed list.

Possible valid 5-letter words fitting L _ _ I _:

- L I is fixed in positions 1 and 4.  
- Position 2 and 5 must be filled with allowed consonants.

Looking at common words:
- L I D I ? – no common word.  
- L I G I ? – no.  
- L I V I ? – no.  
- L I P I ? – no.  
- L I B I ? – no.  
- L I V I D – 5 letters, but ends in D, and positions are L I V I D – but this has I in 4 and D in 5, which fits: L I V I D.

Check letters: L, I, V, I, D – all allowed (none in banned list), and positions:
- L in 1 (required)  
- I in 4 (correct)  
- V in 2  
- I in 3 (but we already have I in 4; this is allowed because the word can have multiple I’s)  
- D in 5  

However, the word “LIVED” is L I V E D, but E is banned.  
The word “LIVID” is L I V I D – this is actually a valid English word meaning “showing no emotion or interest.”  
All letters L, I, V, I, D are allowed by our constraints.

Therefore, “LIVID” is the logical next guess.",Guess 6: lived -> FEEDBACK: L(-) I(✓) V(-) E(x) D(x),FAIL
