For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"" are popular choices for this reason. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. 

""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common)
- O (common)
- S (common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This should give us good information about which of these common letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R is not in the word (x).
- O is not in the word (x).
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — so the 4th letter is S.
- E is not in the word (x).

So far we know:
- 4th letter is S.
- The word contains A but not in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with S in position 4, and A somewhere except position 1. We also want to avoid R, O, E.

Possible letters to use: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we should stick to common ones).

Let’s look for common patterns with S in position 4:
- _ _ _ S _
- A must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Good candidates:
- ""HASTY"" – but Y is less common.
- ""LASTS"" – but S is already in position 4, and we don’t know if S repeats.
- ""BASS_"" – but we don’t know about repeats.
- ""MASS_"" – same issue.
- ""PASTA"" – A is in position 5, which is allowed (since A is in the word but not in position 1). Also avoids R, O, E.

""PASTA"" uses:
- P (new letter)
- A (known to be in word, position 5 is fine)
- S (correct position 4)
- T (new letter)
- A (repeats A, but we don’t know if repeats are possible)

This seems like a good test to confirm A in position 5 and check P and T.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after both guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- R, O, E are NOT in the word.
- S is in the word and is in position 4 (✓ on 4th letter).

From Guess 2 (PASTA):
- P is NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2, 3, 4, or 5 (all four A’s in PASTA got “-”).
  – This means A must be in position 1, but Guess 1 already told us A is NOT in position 1.
  – Therefore A cannot be in any position, which contradicts the earlier “A is in the word”.
  – The only resolution is that the A in position 3 of PASTA is actually in the correct position 3 (i.e., the feedback for the third letter should be ✓, not -).
  – So we must have mis-read the feedback: the third letter in PASTA (S) was marked ✓, not -.
  – Let me re-parse the feedback carefully:

P A S T A
x - ✓ - -

So:
- P: not in word (x)
- A (pos 1): wrong position (-)
- S (pos 2): correct position (✓) → S is in position 2
- T (pos 3): wrong position (-)
- A (pos 4): wrong position (-)

From this, the correct information is:
- S is in position 2 (✓ on 2nd letter in PASTA)
- A is in the word but not in positions 1, 4, or 5
- T is in the word but not in position 3
- P and R, O, E are not in the word

So positions are:
1: ?
2: S
3: ?
4: ?
5: ?

A must be in position 3 or 4 (since it can’t be 1,4,5).  
T must be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (can’t be 3, and 2 is already S).

Let’s build a word:
- Position 2 = S
- Try A in position 3: _ S A _ _
- Put T in position 1 or 5: T S A _ _ or _ S A _ T

Common 5-letter words that fit:
- T S A _ _ → “TS… ” not common.
- _ S A _ T → “USAPT” not a word.
- “M S A C T” not valid.
- “B S A C T” invalid.
- “F S A C T” invalid.
- “L S A C T” invalid.

Let’s try A in position 4: _ S _ A _
Then T must go in position 1 or 5:
- T S _ A _ → “T S _ A _” → “TS…A… ” possible words: “TSAFA” (invalid), “TSALA” (invalid), “TSAKA” (invalid), “TSAMA” (invalid), “TSAVA” (invalid), “TSAZA” (invalid).
- _ S _ A T → “_ S _ A T” → “USAT” is 4 letters, “BSAT” invalid, “DSAT” invalid, “FSAT” invalid, “GSAT” invalid, “HSAT” invalid, “ISAT” invalid, “KSAT” invalid, “MSAT” invalid, “PSAT” invalid (P already excluded), “QSAT” invalid, “RSAT” invalid (R excluded), “SSAT” invalid (S already in position 2), “TSAT” invalid (T already in position 1 or 5), “USAT” invalid, “VSAT” invalid, “WSAT” invalid, “XSAT” invalid, “YSAT” invalid, “ZSAT” invalid.

Hmm, none of these seem to work. Let me reconsider the placement.

Wait, the feedback for PASTA was:
P(x) A(-) S(-) T(-) A(-)
But I mis-read the positions. Let me re-index:

P A S T A
1 2 3 4 5

Feedback:
1: P(x) – P not in word
2: A(-) – A is in word but not in position 2
3: S(-) – S is in word but not in position 3
4: T(-) – T is in word but not in position 4
5: A(-) – A is in word but not in position 5

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- S is in position 4 (✓ on 4th letter) → so position 4 = S

From Guess 2 (PASTA):
- S is in word but not in position 3 (from feedback S(-) in position 3) – but we already know S is in position 4, so this is consistent.
- A is in word but not in positions 2 or 5 (from feedback A(-) in positions 2 and 5)
- T is in word but not in position 4 (from feedback T(-) in position 4) – but position 4 is S, so this is consistent.
- P, R, O, E are not in word.

So current constraints:
- Position 4 = S
- A is in word, positions 1, 3 possible (since it can’t be 2,4,5)
- T is in word, positions 1,2,3,5 possible (can’t be 4)

Let’s list possible positions:
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Letters:   ? ? ? S ?

A must be in 1 or 3.
T must be in 1,2,3,5.

Case 1: A in position 1
Word form: A _ _ S _
T must be in 2, 3, or 5 (since 1 is A, 4 is S)
Possible:
A T _ S _ → “AT…S… ” possible words: “ATLAS” (but L and A in 3), “ATMAN” (N not confirmed), “ATLAS” fits: A T L A S
Check letters:
- A in 1: allowed (feedback said A not in 2 or 5, so 1 is fine)
- T in 2: allowed (feedback said T not in 4, so 2 is fine)
- L: new letter, not excluded
- A in 3: allowed (feedback only said A not in 2 or 5)
- S in 4: correct

“ATLAS” seems valid and fits all constraints.

Case 2: A in position 3
Word form: _ _ A S _
T must be in 1,2, or 5
Possible:
T _ A S _ → “T _ A S _” → “T M A S T” (invalid), “T O A S T” (O excluded), “T I A S T” (invalid), “T U A S T” (invalid)
_ T A S _ → “U T A S H” (invalid), “I T A S H” (invalid), “D T A S H” (invalid)
_ _ A S T → “B A A S T” (invalid), “C A A S T” (invalid), “F A A S T” (invalid), “G A A S T” (invalid), “H A A S T” (invalid), “J A A S T” (invalid), “K A A S T” (invalid), “M A A S T” (invalid), “N A A S T” (invalid), “P A A S T” (P excluded), “Q A A S T” (invalid), “R A A S T” (R excluded), “S A A S T” (S already in 4), “V A A S T” (invalid), “W A A S T” (invalid), “X A A S T” (invalid), “Y A A S T” (invalid), “Z A A S T” (invalid)

No valid words found in Case 2.

Thus, the only valid word fitting all constraints is “ATLAS”.

</think>

Based on the feedback:
- S is confirmed in position 4.
- A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5, so it must be in position 1 or 3.
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (already S), so possible positions 1,2,3,5.
- P, R, O, E are excluded.

The only valid word fitting these constraints is:

- A is in the word but NOT in position 2, 3, 4, or 5 (all four A’s in PASTA got “-”).
  – This means A must be in position 1, but Guess 1 already told us A is NOT in position 1.
  – Therefore A cannot be in any position, which contradicts the earlier “A is in the word”.
  – The only resolution is that the A in position 3 of PASTA is actually in the correct position 3 (i.e., the feedback for the third letter should be ✓, not -).
  – So we must have mis-read the feedback: the third letter in PASTA (S) was marked ✓, not -.
  – Let me re-parse the feedback carefully:

P A S T A
x - ✓ - -

So:
- P: not in word (x)
- A (pos 1): wrong position (-)
- S (pos 2): correct position (✓) → S is in position 2
- T (pos 3): wrong position (-)
- A (pos 4): wrong position (-)

From this, the correct information is:
- S is in position 2 (✓ on 2nd letter in PASTA)
- A is in the word but not in positions 1, 4, or 5
- T is in the word but not in position 3
- P and R, O, E are not in the word

So positions are:
1: ?
2: S
3: ?
4: ?
5: ?

A must be in position 3 or 4 (since it can’t be 1,4,5).  
T must be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (can’t be 3, and 2 is already S).

Let’s build a word:
- Position 2 = S
- Try A in position 3: _ S A _ _
- Put T in position 1 or 5: T S A _ _ or _ S A _ T

Common 5-letter words that fit:
- T S A _ _ → “TS… ” not common.
- _ S A _ T → “USAPT” not a word.
- “M S A C T” not valid.
- “B S A C T” invalid.
- “F S A C T” invalid.
- “L S A C T” invalid.

Let’s try A in position 4: _ S _ A _
Then T must go in position 1 or 5:
- T S _ A _ → “T S _ A _” → “TS…A… ” possible words: “TSAFA” (invalid), “TSALA” (invalid), “TSAKA” (invalid), “TSAMA” (invalid), “TSAVA” (invalid), “TSAZA” (invalid).
- _ S _ A T → “_ S _ A T” → “USAT” is 4 letters, “BSAT” invalid, “DSAT” invalid, “FSAT” invalid, “GSAT” invalid, “HSAT” invalid, “ISAT” invalid, “KSAT” invalid, “MSAT” invalid, “PSAT” invalid (P already excluded), “QSAT” invalid, “RSAT” invalid (R excluded), “SSAT” invalid (S already in position 2), “TSAT” invalid (T already in position 1 or 5), “USAT” invalid, “VSAT” invalid, “WSAT” invalid, “XSAT” invalid, “YSAT” invalid, “ZSAT” invalid.

Hmm, none of these seem to work. Let me reconsider the placement.

Wait, the feedback for PASTA was:
P(x) A(-) S(-) T(-) A(-)
But I mis-read the positions. Let me re-index:

P A S T A
1 2 3 4 5

Feedback:
1: P(x) – P not in word
2: A(-) – A is in word but not in position 2
3: S(-) – S is in word but not in position 3
4: T(-) – T is in word but not in position 4
5: A(-) – A is in word but not in position 5

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- S is in position 4 (✓ on 4th letter) → so position 4 = S

From Guess 2 (PASTA):
- S is in word but not in position 3 (from feedback S(-) in position 3) – but we already know S is in position 4, so this is consistent.
- A is in word but not in positions 2 or 5 (from feedback A(-) in positions 2 and 5)
- T is in word but not in position 4 (from feedback T(-) in position 4) – but position 4 is S, so this is consistent.
- P, R, O, E are not in word.

So current constraints:
- Position 4 = S
- A is in word, positions 1, 3 possible (since it can’t be 2,4,5)
- T is in word, positions 1,2,3,5 possible (can’t be 4)

Let’s list possible positions:
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Letters:   ? ? ? S ?

A must be in 1 or 3.
T must be in 1,2,3,5.

Case 1: A in position 1
Word form: A _ _ S _
T must be in 2, 3, or 5 (since 1 is A, 4 is S)
Possible:
A T _ S _ → “AT…S… ” possible words: “ATLAS” (but L and A in 3), “ATMAN” (N not confirmed), “ATLAS” fits: A T L A S
Check letters:
- A in 1: allowed (feedback said A not in 2 or 5, so 1 is fine)
- T in 2: allowed (feedback said T not in 4, so 2 is fine)
- L: new letter, not excluded
- A in 3: allowed (feedback only said A not in 2 or 5)
- S in 4: correct

“ATLAS” seems valid and fits all constraints.

Case 2: A in position 3
Word form: _ _ A S _
T must be in 1,2, or 5
Possible:
T _ A S _ → “T _ A S _” → “T M A S T” (invalid), “T O A S T” (O excluded), “T I A S T” (invalid), “T U A S T” (invalid)
_ T A S _ → “U T A S H” (invalid), “I T A S H” (invalid), “D T A S H” (invalid)
_ _ A S T → “B A A S T” (invalid), “C A A S T” (invalid), “F A A S T” (invalid), “G A A S T” (invalid), “H A A S T” (invalid), “J A A S T” (invalid), “K A A S T” (invalid), “M A A S T” (invalid), “N A A S T” (invalid), “P A A S T” (P excluded), “Q A A S T” (invalid), “R A A S T” (R excluded), “S A A S T” (S already in 4), “V A A S T” (invalid), “W A A S T” (invalid), “X A A S T” (invalid), “Y A A S T” (invalid), “Z A A S T” (invalid)

No valid words found in Case 2.

Thus, the only valid word fitting all constraints is “ATLAS”.Based on the feedback:
- S is confirmed in position 4.
- A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5, so it must be in position 1 or 3.
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (already S), so possible positions 1,2,3,5.
- P, R, O, E are excluded.

The only valid word fitting these constraints is:",Guess 3: ATLAS -> FEEDBACK: A(-) T(✓) L(x) A(-) S(-),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ADIEU"" are popular choices for this reason. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that incorporates several of these. 

""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common)
- O (common)
- S (common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This should give us good information about which of these common letters are in the word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R is not in the word (x).
- O is not in the word (x).
- S is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — so the 4th letter is S.
- E is not in the word (x).

So far we know:
- 4th letter is S.
- The word contains A but not in position 1.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with S in position 4, and A somewhere except position 1. We also want to avoid R, O, E.

Possible letters to use: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we should stick to common ones).

Let’s look for common patterns with S in position 4:
- _ _ _ S _
- A must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.

Good candidates:
- ""HASTY"" – but Y is less common.
- ""LASTS"" – but S is already in position 4, and we don’t know if S repeats.
- ""BASS_"" – but we don’t know about repeats.
- ""MASS_"" – same issue.
- ""PASTA"" – A is in position 5, which is allowed (since A is in the word but not in position 1). Also avoids R, O, E.

""PASTA"" uses:
- P (new letter)
- A (known to be in word, position 5 is fine)
- S (correct position 4)
- T (new letter)
- A (repeats A, but we don’t know if repeats are possible)

This seems like a good test to confirm A in position 5 and check P and T.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after both guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- R, O, E are NOT in the word.
- S is in the word and is in position 4 (✓ on 4th letter).

From Guess 2 (PASTA):
- P is NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2, 3, 4, or 5 (all four A’s in PASTA got “-”).
  – This means A must be in position 1, but Guess 1 already told us A is NOT in position 1.
  – Therefore A cannot be in any position, which contradicts the earlier “A is in the word”.
  – The only resolution is that the A in position 3 of PASTA is actually in the correct position 3 (i.e., the feedback for the third letter should be ✓, not -).
  – So we must have mis-read the feedback: the third letter in PASTA (S) was marked ✓, not -.
  – Let me re-parse the feedback carefully:

P A S T A
x - ✓ - -

So:
- P: not in word (x)
- A (pos 1): wrong position (-)
- S (pos 2): correct position (✓) → S is in position 2
- T (pos 3): wrong position (-)
- A (pos 4): wrong position (-)

From this, the correct information is:
- S is in position 2 (✓ on 2nd letter in PASTA)
- A is in the word but not in positions 1, 4, or 5
- T is in the word but not in position 3
- P and R, O, E are not in the word

So positions are:
1: ?
2: S
3: ?
4: ?
5: ?

A must be in position 3 or 4 (since it can’t be 1,4,5).  
T must be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (can’t be 3, and 2 is already S).

Let’s build a word:
- Position 2 = S
- Try A in position 3: _ S A _ _
- Put T in position 1 or 5: T S A _ _ or _ S A _ T

Common 5-letter words that fit:
- T S A _ _ → “TS… ” not common.
- _ S A _ T → “USAPT” not a word.
- “M S A C T” not valid.
- “B S A C T” invalid.
- “F S A C T” invalid.
- “L S A C T” invalid.

Let’s try A in position 4: _ S _ A _
Then T must go in position 1 or 5:
- T S _ A _ → “T S _ A _” → “TS…A… ” possible words: “TSAFA” (invalid), “TSALA” (invalid), “TSAKA” (invalid), “TSAMA” (invalid), “TSAVA” (invalid), “TSAZA” (invalid).
- _ S _ A T → “_ S _ A T” → “USAT” is 4 letters, “BSAT” invalid, “DSAT” invalid, “FSAT” invalid, “GSAT” invalid, “HSAT” invalid, “ISAT” invalid, “KSAT” invalid, “MSAT” invalid, “PSAT” invalid (P already excluded), “QSAT” invalid, “RSAT” invalid (R excluded), “SSAT” invalid (S already in position 2), “TSAT” invalid (T already in position 1 or 5), “USAT” invalid, “VSAT” invalid, “WSAT” invalid, “XSAT” invalid, “YSAT” invalid, “ZSAT” invalid.

Hmm, none of these seem to work. Let me reconsider the placement.

Wait, the feedback for PASTA was:
P(x) A(-) S(-) T(-) A(-)
But I mis-read the positions. Let me re-index:

P A S T A
1 2 3 4 5

Feedback:
1: P(x) – P not in word
2: A(-) – A is in word but not in position 2
3: S(-) – S is in word but not in position 3
4: T(-) – T is in word but not in position 4
5: A(-) – A is in word but not in position 5

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- S is in position 4 (✓ on 4th letter) → so position 4 = S

From Guess 2 (PASTA):
- S is in word but not in position 3 (from feedback S(-) in position 3) – but we already know S is in position 4, so this is consistent.
- A is in word but not in positions 2 or 5 (from feedback A(-) in positions 2 and 5)
- T is in word but not in position 4 (from feedback T(-) in position 4) – but position 4 is S, so this is consistent.
- P, R, O, E are not in word.

So current constraints:
- Position 4 = S
- A is in word, positions 1, 3 possible (since it can’t be 2,4,5)
- T is in word, positions 1,2,3,5 possible (can’t be 4)

Let’s list possible positions:
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Letters:   ? ? ? S ?

A must be in 1 or 3.
T must be in 1,2,3,5.

Case 1: A in position 1
Word form: A _ _ S _
T must be in 2, 3, or 5 (since 1 is A, 4 is S)
Possible:
A T _ S _ → “AT…S… ” possible words: “ATLAS” (but L and A in 3), “ATMAN” (N not confirmed), “ATLAS” fits: A T L A S
Check letters:
- A in 1: allowed (feedback said A not in 2 or 5, so 1 is fine)
- T in 2: allowed (feedback said T not in 4, so 2 is fine)
- L: new letter, not excluded
- A in 3: allowed (feedback only said A not in 2 or 5)
- S in 4: correct

“ATLAS” seems valid and fits all constraints.

Case 2: A in position 3
Word form: _ _ A S _
T must be in 1,2, or 5
Possible:
T _ A S _ → “T _ A S _” → “T M A S T” (invalid), “T O A S T” (O excluded), “T I A S T” (invalid), “T U A S T” (invalid)
_ T A S _ → “U T A S H” (invalid), “I T A S H” (invalid), “D T A S H” (invalid)
_ _ A S T → “B A A S T” (invalid), “C A A S T” (invalid), “F A A S T” (invalid), “G A A S T” (invalid), “H A A S T” (invalid), “J A A S T” (invalid), “K A A S T” (invalid), “M A A S T” (invalid), “N A A S T” (invalid), “P A A S T” (P excluded), “Q A A S T” (invalid), “R A A S T” (R excluded), “S A A S T” (S already in 4), “V A A S T” (invalid), “W A A S T” (invalid), “X A A S T” (invalid), “Y A A S T” (invalid), “Z A A S T” (invalid)

No valid words found in Case 2.

Thus, the only valid word fitting all constraints is “ATLAS”.Based on the feedback:
- S is confirmed in position 4.
- A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5, so it must be in position 1 or 3.
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (already S), so possible positions 1,2,3,5.
- P, R, O, E are excluded.

The only valid word fitting these constraints is:

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the three guesses.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
- A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- R, O, E are NOT in the word.
- S is in position 4 (✓ on 4th letter).

Guess 2: PASTA → P(x) A(-) S(-) T(-) A(-)
- P is NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from S(-) in position 3) — but we already know S is in position 4, so this is consistent.
- T is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from T(-) in position 4) — but position 4 is S, so this is also consistent.
- R, O, E are already excluded.

Guess 3: ATLAS → A(-) T(✓) L(x) A(-) S(-)
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 3 (from the two A(-)’s in positions 1 and 4).
- T is in position 2 (✓ on 2nd letter).
- L is NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but NOT in position 5 (from S(-) in position 5) — but we already know S is in position 4, so this is consistent.

Current constraints:
- Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
- Letters:   ? T ? S ?
- A is in the word and must be in position 2 or 4. But position 2 is T, position 4 is S, so A cannot be placed. This implies our earlier conclusion that A must be in position 1 or 3 must be re-examined.

Wait, let’s re-examine the A feedback carefully:
- Guess 1 AROSE: A(-) — A is in word, not in position 1.
- Guess 2 PASTA: A(-) in position 2 and A(-) in position 5 — A is in word, not in positions 2 or 5.
- Guess 3 ATLAS: A(-) in position 1 and A(-) in position 4 — A is in word, not in positions 1 or 4.

So A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5. The only remaining position is 3.

Thus:
- Position 3 = A
- Position 2 = T (from ATLAS feedback)
- Position 4 = S (from AROSE feedback)

So the word must be: _ T A S _

Now we need to determine positions 1 and 5.

Letters already excluded: R, O, E, P, L.
Letters still possible: A (used), B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need common 5-letter words fitting _ T A S _. Possible candidates:
- B T A S ? — no common word
- C T A S ? — no
- D T A S ? — no
- F T A S ? — no
- G T A S ? — no
- H T A S ? — no
- I T A S ? — no
- J T A S ? — no
- K T A S ? — no
- M T A S ? — no
- N T A S ? — no
- U T A S ? — no
- V T A S ? — no
- W T A S ? — no
- Y T A S ? — no

Wait, let me think differently: maybe the word is ""STASH"" but that doesn’t fit _ T A S _.

Actually, the pattern _ T A S _ with common letters:
- ""UTASE"" — no
- ""VTAS"" — no
- ""XTAS"" — no

Hmm, perhaps I missed something. Let me list valid English 5-letter words matching _ T A S _:

Looking through a dictionary:
- ""UTASE"" — not a word
- ""VTAS"" — no
- ""XTAS"" — no
- ""ATLAS"" — already tried
- ""STASH"" — S T A S H — fits _ T A S _ with H in position 5.

""STASH"" fits all constraints:
- S T A S H
- Position 1: S (not excluded)
- Position 2: T (matches ✓ from ATLAS)
- Position 3: A (only remaining possible position for A)
- Position 4: S (matches ✓ from AROSE)
- Position 5: H (new letter, not excluded)

Let me verify feedback implications:
- A is in position 3 — allowed by all feedback
- T is in position 2 — matches ✓
- S is in positions 1 and 4 — allowed since S is confirmed in position 4 and there’s no restriction on repeats
- H is new letter, not excluded

Thus, the logical next guess is ""STASH"".
