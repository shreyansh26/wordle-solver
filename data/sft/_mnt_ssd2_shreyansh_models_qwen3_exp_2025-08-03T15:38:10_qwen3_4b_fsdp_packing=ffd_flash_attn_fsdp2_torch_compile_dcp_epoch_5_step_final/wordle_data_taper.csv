### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters in different positions to quickly narrow down possibilities.

A good strategy is to use a word with distinct letters that appear frequently. ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(-) : A is in the word, but not in position 1.  
- R(-) : R is in the word, but not in position 2.  
- O(x) : O is **not** in the word.  
- S(x) : S is **not** in the word.  
- E(-) : E is in the word, but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, E (but each in a different position than shown).  
- Does **not** contain O or S.

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, R, E in positions other than 1, 2, 5 respectively, and avoids O and S.

Let’s try a word that shifts A, R, E to new positions and adds two new consonants that are common and haven’t been ruled out. A good candidate is “REACT”:

- R moves to position 1 (allowed, since R was only ruled out of position 2).  
- E moves to position 2 (allowed, since E was only ruled out of position 5).  
- A moves to position 3 (allowed, since A was only ruled out of position 1).  
- C and T are new letters that haven’t been tested yet and are common.

This should help us narrow down the correct positions for A, R, E and test C and T.

Let's consolidate what we now know from the two guesses:

Letters that are in the word (but we still don’t know their exact positions):
- A – not in positions 1, 3  
- R – not in positions 2, 1  
- E – not in positions 5, 2  
- T – not in position 5  

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
- O, S, C  

So the word contains A, R, E, T and one more letter that we have not yet tested.  
We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, R, E, T exactly once each  
- Uses one new letter (not O, S, C)  
- Places A, R, E, T in positions they have not yet been ruled out for  

Let’s list the allowable positions for each of the four known letters:
- A: allowed in positions 2, 4, 5  
- R: allowed in positions 3, 4, 5  
- E: allowed in positions 1, 3, 4  
- T: allowed in positions 1, 2, 3, 4  

A good next word should place these letters in new positions while introducing a fresh consonant.  
Trying “TREAD”:
- T in position 1 (allowed)  
- R in position 2 – but R was already ruled out of position 2 in guess 1.  
So “TREAD” is invalid.

Trying “REACT” again shows C is invalid, so we need a new letter.  
Let’s try “TAPER”:
- T in position 1 (allowed)  
- A in position 2 (allowed)  
- P is a new letter (not yet tested)  
- E in position 3 (allowed)  
- R in position 5 (allowed)  

This satisfies all constraints.
