### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-3 consonants to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is excellent because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This will help me quickly identify which vowels are present and their positions, as well as whether R or S are in the word.

3. Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, O, S, T, D.

So far:
- Position 2 = R
- Position 3 ≠ E (because E was marked ✓ but not in position 3, which is impossible—so the ✓ must mean it is in position 3, which contradicts the feedback. Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.

Looking back at Guess 2: trend -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) E(✓) N(-) D(x)
- R(✓) means R is in the correct position (position 2).

So the pattern is now: _ R E _ _

- N is somewhere in the word, but not in position 4.
- Letters to avoid: A, O, S, T, D.

Possible positions for N: 1, 5 (since 2 and 3 are R and E, and 4 is open but N can't be there).

Let's try a word that:
- Keeps R in position 2 and E in position 3.
- Places N in position 1 or 5.
- Uses new letters to test possibilities.

A good candidate is ""NRE"" plus two new consonants, but we need a valid 5-letter word. ""NRE"" isn't a prefix. Let's think of words fitting _ R E _ _ with N somewhere.

Possible words:
- ""N"" + ""R"" + ""E"" + ... but N can't be first because then it would be N R E _ _, but we need to check if that's valid.
- ""B"" R E ""N"" _ → ""BRENT"" but T is excluded.
- ""C"" R E ""N"" _ → ""CREn_"" but we need a valid word.
- ""F"" R E ""N"" _ → ""FREND"" but D is excluded.
- ""G"" R E ""N"" _ → ""GREN_"" not valid.
- ""P"" R E ""N"" _ → ""PREN_"" not valid.
- ""N"" in position 5: _ R E _ N
   - Possible first letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y
   - Second letter is R, third is E, fifth is N.
   - Valid words: ""B R E E N"" (but E is already in position 3), ""F R E E N"" (invalid), ""C R E P N"" (invalid), ""P R E E N"" (invalid), ""W R E E N"" (invalid), ""Y R E E N"" (invalid), ""V R E E N"" (invalid), ""M R E E N"" (invalid), ""K R E E N"" (invalid), ""L R E E N"" (invalid), ""H R E E N"" (invalid), ""G R E E N"" → ""GREEN"" is valid!

""GREEN"" fits:

- ""C"" R E ""N"" _ → ""CREn_"" but we need a valid word.
- ""F"" R E ""N"" _ → ""FREND"" but D is excluded.
- ""G"" R E ""N"" _ → ""GREN_"" not valid.
- ""P"" R E ""N"" _ → ""PREN_"" not valid.
- ""N"" in position 5: _ R E _ N
   - Possible first letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y
   - Second letter is R, third is E, fifth is N.
   - Valid words: ""B R E E N"" (but E is already in position 3), ""F R E E N"" (invalid), ""C R E P N"" (invalid), ""P R E E N"" (invalid), ""W R E E N"" (invalid), ""Y R E E N"" (invalid), ""V R E E N"" (invalid), ""M R E E N"" (invalid), ""K R E E N"" (invalid), ""L R E E N"" (invalid), ""H R E E N"" (invalid), ""G R E E N"" → ""GREEN"" is valid!

""GREEN"" fits:
- G (new letter)
- R (correct position 2)
- E (correct position 3)
- E (new position 4)
- N (correct position 5, and N wasn't excluded from position 5)

This seems like the best next guess.

Current confirmed information:
- Pattern: _ R E E N (positions 2-5 are R, E, E, N)
- Letters to avoid: A, O, S, T, D, G
- We still need the first letter.

Possible first letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with one of these letters and follows the pattern _ R E E N.

Looking at common words ending in ""REEN"":
- ""BREEN"" – not a standard English word.
- ""CREEN"" – not standard.
- ""FREEN"" – not standard.
- ""PREEN"" – this is a valid word (to inspect closely or fling something).
- ""TREEN"" – but T is excluded.
- ""WREEN"" – not standard.
- ""YREEN"" – not standard.

""PREEN"" fits all constraints:
- Starts with P (not excluded).
- Follows _ R E E N pattern.
- All letters P, R, E, E, N are allowed based on previous feedback.

Let's verify:
- P: new letter, not excluded.
- R: confirmed position 2.
- E: confirmed positions 3 and 4.
- E: same.
- N: confirmed position 5.

This should be the correct word.
