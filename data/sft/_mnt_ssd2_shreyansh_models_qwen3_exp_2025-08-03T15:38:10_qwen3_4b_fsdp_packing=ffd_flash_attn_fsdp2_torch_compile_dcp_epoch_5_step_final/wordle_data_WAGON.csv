For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should ideally include several of these.

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good chance to identify or eliminate several letters in the secret word right away. Other good options might be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong with its mix of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on “arose”:

- O(-) → O is in the word but in the wrong position (not 3rd).

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and O somewhere other than positions 1 and 3.
2. Avoids R, S, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants to maximize information.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.

A strong candidate is “COATL” (but that’s not a common English word). Instead, let’s pick “PLAID”:
- P: new consonant
- L: new consonant
- A: in position 3 (was 1st before, now testing 3rd)
- I: new vowel
- D: new consonant

This tests several new letters while placing A in a new spot and avoiding all eliminated letters (R,S,E).

From all feedback so far:

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
R, S, E, P, L, I, D, C, T

Letters we know ARE in the word:
- A is in the word and is in position 2 (✓ at position 2 in canto)
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (from arose) and not in position 4 (from canto) → O can be in positions 1, 2, or 5. But position 2 is already A, so O can be in 1 or 5.
- N is in the word but not in position 3 (from canto) → N can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5. Position 2 is A, so N can be in 1, 4, or 5.

So the word looks like: _ A _ _ _ with remaining letters to place: O and N, plus two more consonants from the still-allowed set: B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible positions:
- O can be in 1 or 5
- N can be in 1, 4, or 5
- We need two more consonants (not yet eliminated)

Let’s list possible patterns:

1. O A N _ _ → but then N is in position 3, which is invalid (from canto)
2. O A _ N _ → N in position 4, O in 1
3. O A _ _ N → N in 5, O in 1
4. N A O _ _ → N in 1, O in 3 (invalid)
5. N A _ O _ → N in 1, O in 4 (invalid)
6. N A _ _ O → N in 1, O in 5

Similarly:
- _ A O N _ → O in 3 (invalid)
- _ A N O _ → N in 3 (invalid)
- _ A _ O N → O in 4 (invalid)

So valid patterns are:
- O A _ N _
- O A _ _ N
- N A _ _ O

We need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try O A _ N _:
Need two consonants in positions 3 and 5. Allowed consonants: B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y
Possible words:
- O A B N _ → need a consonant in 5: OABN_ → OABNK? Not a word
- O A G N _ → OAGN_ → OAGNY? Not a word
- O A H N _ → OAHN_ → OAHNB? Not a word
- O A M N _ → OAMN_ → OAMNB? Not a word
- O A K N _ → OAKN_ → OAKNY? Not a word
- O A V N _ → OAVN_ → OAVNB? Not a word

Next pattern: O A _ _ N

Hmm, none of these are valid. Let’s think differently: maybe the word has more than two consonants, but we have only O and N confirmed so far. Wait, the word must contain A, O, N (since we know O and N are in the word). So the word is a permutation of A, O, N plus two other consonants, with A fixed at position 2.

Let’s list possible words with A at position 2 and containing O and N, avoiding eliminated letters.

Possible consonants left: B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y

Let’s try:

Let me check NACHO:
- N: allowed (not eliminated)
- A: position 2 (matches ✓)
- C: allowed (not eliminated)
- H: allowed (not eliminated)
- O: position 5 (allowed, since O can be in 1 or 5)

This fits all constraints:
- Contains A (position 2), O (position 5), N (position 1)
- Uses only allowed letters: N, A, C, H, O
- No eliminated letters used
- Positions:
  - A is in position 2 (correct)
  - O is in position 5 (allowed)
  - N is in position 1 (allowed)

Therefore, NACHO is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should ideally include several of these.

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good chance to identify or eliminate several letters in the secret word right away. Other good options might be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong with its mix of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but in the wrong position (not 3rd).
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and O (but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively).
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and O somewhere other than positions 1 and 3.
2. Avoids R, S, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants to maximize information.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.

A strong candidate is “COATL” (but that’s not a common English word). Instead, let’s pick “PLAID”:
- P: new consonant
- L: new consonant
- A: in position 3 (was 1st before, now testing 3rd)
- I: new vowel
- D: new consonant

This tests several new letters while placing A in a new spot and avoiding all eliminated letters (R,S,E).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: plaid -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
R, S, E, P, L, I, D

Letters we know ARE in the word (but positions still unknown):
A, O

So the secret word must contain both A and O, and may not contain any of the eliminated letters.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A and O (each at least once)
- Does NOT use R, S, E, P, L, I, D
- Has A not in position 1 (from arose) and not in position 3 (from plaid)
- Has O not in position 3 (from arose)

Remaining common consonants we can still use: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, T, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that places A and O in new positions and uses fresh consonants.  
A good candidate is “COBRA”:
- C, B are new letters
- O in position 2 (new position)
- A in position 4 (new position)
- R is already eliminated, so this word is invalid.

Next candidate: “MANGO”
- M, N, G fresh
- A in position 2 (new)
- O in position 3 (but O cannot be in position 3 from arose feedback) → invalid.

Next: “COBIA”
- C, B, I fresh? I is already eliminated → invalid.

Next: “TONAL”
- T, N, A, L fresh? L is eliminated → invalid.

Next: “COYPU”
- C, Y, P, U fresh? P is eliminated → invalid.

Next: “CANTO”
- C, N, T fresh
- A in position 2 (new)
- O in position 4 (new)
- No eliminated letters used
- Meets all constraints

Let’s choose “CANTO”.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
R, S, E, P, L, I, D, C, T

Letters we know ARE in the word:
- A is in the word and is in position 2 (✓ at position 2 in canto)
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (from arose) and not in position 4 (from canto) → O can be in positions 1, 2, or 5. But position 2 is already A, so O can be in 1 or 5.
- N is in the word but not in position 3 (from canto) → N can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5. Position 2 is A, so N can be in 1, 4, or 5.

So the word looks like: _ A _ _ _ with remaining letters to place: O and N, plus two more consonants from the still-allowed set: B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible positions:
- O can be in 1 or 5
- N can be in 1, 4, or 5
- We need two more consonants (not yet eliminated)

Let’s list possible patterns:

1. O A N _ _ → but then N is in position 3, which is invalid (from canto)
2. O A _ N _ → N in position 4, O in 1
3. O A _ _ N → N in 5, O in 1
4. N A O _ _ → N in 1, O in 3 (invalid)
5. N A _ O _ → N in 1, O in 4 (invalid)
6. N A _ _ O → N in 1, O in 5

Similarly:
- _ A O N _ → O in 3 (invalid)
- _ A N O _ → N in 3 (invalid)
- _ A _ O N → O in 4 (invalid)

So valid patterns are:
- O A _ N _
- O A _ _ N
- N A _ _ O

We need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try O A _ N _:
Need two consonants in positions 3 and 5. Allowed consonants: B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y
Possible words:
- O A B N _ → need a consonant in 5: OABN_ → OABNK? Not a word
- O A G N _ → OAGN_ → OAGNY? Not a word
- O A H N _ → OAHN_ → OAHNB? Not a word
- O A M N _ → OAMN_ → OAMNB? Not a word
- O A K N _ → OAKN_ → OAKNY? Not a word
- O A V N _ → OAVN_ → OAVNB? Not a word

Next pattern: O A _ _ N
Positions 3 and 4: need two consonants
Possible words:
- O A B C N → OABCN? Not a word
- O A B D N → D eliminated
- O A B F N → OABFN? Not a word
- O A B G N → OABGN? Not a word
- O A B H N → OABHN? Not a word
- O A B K N → OABKN? Not a word
- O A B M N → OABMN? Not a word
- O A B V N → OABVN? Not a word
- O A B W N → OABWN? Not a word
- O A B Y N → OABYN? Not a word

This seems difficult. Let’s try N A _ _ O:
Positions 3 and 4: need two consonants
Possible words:
- N A B C O → NABCO? Not a word
- N A B D O → D eliminated
- N A B F O → NABFO? Not a word
- N A B G O → NABGO? Not a word
- N A B H O → NABHO? Not a word
- N A B K O → NABKO? Not a word
- N A B M O → NABMO? Not a word
- N A B V O → NABVO? Not a word
- N A B W O → NABWO? Not a word
- N A B Y O → NABYO? Not a word

Hmm, none of these are valid. Let’s think differently: maybe the word has more than two consonants, but we have only O and N confirmed so far. Wait, the word must contain A, O, N (since we know O and N are in the word). So the word is a permutation of A, O, N plus two other consonants, with A fixed at position 2.

Let’s list possible words with A at position 2 and containing O and N, avoiding eliminated letters.

Possible consonants left: B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y

Let’s try:
- O A N _ _ → N in position 3 is invalid (from canto)
- O A _ N _ → need a consonant in 3 and 5
- O A _ _ N → need consonants in 3 and 4
- N A _ _ O → need consonants in 3 and 4

Let’s try O A _ N _ with consonants:
- O A B N K → OABNK? Not a word
- O A B N M → OABNM? Not a word
- O A B N V → OABNV? Not a word
- O A B N W → OABNW? Not a word
- O A B N Y → OABNY? Not a word

- O A G N B → OAGNB? Not a word
- O A G N K → OAGNK? Not a word
- O A G N M → OAGNM? Not a word
- O A G N V → OAGNV? Not a word
- O A G N W → OAGNW? Not a word
- O A G N Y → OAGNY? Not a word

- O A H N B → OAHNB? Not a word
- O A H N K → OAHNK? Not a word
- O A H N M → OAHNM? Not a word
- O A H N V → OAHNV? Not a word
- O A H N W → OAHNW? Not a word
- O A H N Y → OAHNY? Not a word

- O A K N B → OAKNB? Not a word
- O A K N G → OAKNG? Not a word
- O A K N H → OAKNH? Not a word

- O A V N K → OAVNK? Not a word

- O A V N Y → OAVNY? Not a word

- O A W N B → OAWN B → OAWNB? Not a word
- O A W N G → OAWNG? Not a word
- O A W N H → OAWNH? Not a word
- O A W N K → OAWNK? Not a word
- O A W N M → OAWNM? Not a word
- O A W N V → OAWNV? Not a word
- O A W N Y → OAWNY? Not a word

- O A Y N B → OAYNB? Not a word
- O A Y N G → OAYNG? Not a word
- O A Y N H → OAYNH? Not a word
- O A Y N K → OAYNK? Not a word
- O A Y N M → OAYNM? Not a word
- O A Y N V → OAYNV? Not a word
- O A Y N W → OAYNW? Not a word

This seems impossible. Let’s try the other pattern: O A _ _ N with consonants in 3 and 4.

Possible words:
- O A B C N → OABCN? Not a word
- O A B F N → OABFN? Not a word
- O A B G N → OABGN? Not a word
- O A B H N → OABHN? Not a word
- O A B K N → OABKN? Not a word
- O A B M N → OABMN? Not a word
- O A B V N → OABVN? Not a word
- O A B W N → OABWN? Not a word
- O A B Y N → OABYN? Not a word

- O A F C N → OAFCN? Not a word
- O A F B N → OAFBN? Not a word
- O A F G N → OAFGN? Not a word
- O A F H N → OAFHN? Not a word
- O A F K N → OAFKN? Not a word
- O A F M N → OAFMN? Not a word
- O A F V N → OAFVN? Not a word
- O A F W N → OAFWN? Not a word
- O A F Y N → OAFYN? Not a word

- O A G B N → OAGBN? Not a word
- O A G C N → OAGCN? Not a word
- O A G F N → OAGFN? Not a word
- O A G H N → OAGHN? Not a word
- O A G K N → OAGKN? Not a word
- O A G M N → OAGMN? Not a word
- O A G V N → OAGVN? Not a word
- O A G W N → OAGWN? Not a word
- O A G Y N → OAGYN? Not a word

This is also not working. Let’s try N A _ _ O with consonants in 3 and 4.

Possible words:
- N A B C O → NABCO? Not a word
- N A B F O → NABFO? Not a word
- N A B G O → NABGO? Not a word
- N A B H O → NABHO? Not a word
- N A B K O → NABKO? Not a word
- N A B M O → NABMO? Not a word
- N A B V O → NABVO? Not a word
- N A B W O → NABWO? Not a word
- N A B Y O → NABYO? Not a word

- N A C B O → NACBO? Not a word
- N A C F O → NACFO? Not a word
- N A C G O → NACGO? Not a word
- N A C H O → NACHO → This is a valid word!

Let me check NACHO:
- N: allowed (not eliminated)
- A: position 2 (matches ✓)
- C: allowed (not eliminated)
- H: allowed (not eliminated)
- O: position 5 (allowed, since O can be in 1 or 5)

This fits all constraints:
- Contains A (position 2), O (position 5), N (position 1)
- Uses only allowed letters: N, A, C, H, O
- No eliminated letters used
- Positions:
  - A is in position 2 (correct)
  - O is in position 5 (allowed)
  - N is in position 1 (allowed)

Therefore, NACHO is a valid next guess.

From the four rounds of feedback:

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
R, S, E, P, L, I, D, C, T, H

Letters we know ARE in the word:
- A is in position 2 (✓ at position 2 in canto and nacho)
- N is in the word but not in positions 1 or 3 (from canto and nacho)
- O is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5 (from arose and nacho)

So the word looks like: _ A _ _ _ with remaining letters to place: N and O, plus two more consonants from the still-allowed set: B, F, G, K, M, V, W, Y.

Positions:
- N cannot be in 1 or 3 → possible positions 4 or 5
- O cannot be in 3 or 5 → possible positions 1 or 4
- But position 2 is A, so O could also be in 2, but 2 is A → so O must be in 1 or 4
- N could be in 4 or 5

Let's list possible patterns:

1. O A N _ _ → N in 3 is invalid
2. O A _ N _ → N in 4, O in 1
3. O A _ _ N → N in 5, O in 1
4. _ A O N _ → O in 3 is invalid
5. _ A _ O N → O in 4, N in 5
6. _ A N _ O → O in 5 is invalid
7. N A _ O _ → N in 1 is invalid
8. N A _ _ O → N in 1, O in 5 is invalid

So valid patterns are:
- O A _ N _
- O A _ _ N
- _ A _ O N

We need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only allowed letters.

Let's try O A _ N _ with consonants in positions 3 and 5.

This fits all constraints.

Therefore, WAGON is the next guess.
