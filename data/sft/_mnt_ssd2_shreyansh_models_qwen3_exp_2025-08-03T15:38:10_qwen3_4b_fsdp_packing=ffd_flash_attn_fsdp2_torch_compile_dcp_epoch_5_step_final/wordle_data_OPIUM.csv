For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should include several of these, especially vowels like A and E, and common consonants like R and S.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English

This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, S, E.
- Letter O is present, but not in position 3.
- We still need to test common consonants and vowels.

A good next guess should:
1. Include the known letter O in a different position.
2. Use other common letters not yet tested (T, N, L, I, C, etc.).
3. Avoid A, R, S, E.

A strong candidate is “POINT”:
- P, N, T are common consonants not yet tested.
- O is moved to position 2.
- I is a common vowel not yet tested.
This should help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the new feedback on “point”:

- P(-) → P is in the word but not in position 1.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 2 (and we already knew it’s not in position 3).
- I(✓) → I is in the word and is in position 3.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.
- T(x) → T is not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word has the pattern: _ _ I _ _  (I is locked in position 3).
- The letters O and P are in the word but not in positions 2 or 1 respectively.
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, S, E, N, T.

We still need to test common consonants like L, C, D, M, G, B, and vowels U (since A, E, O are either ruled out or in the word). We should place O and P in new positions to confirm their locations.

A good next guess would place:
- O in position 4 or 5 (since it can’t be 2 or 3)
- P in position 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is already I), so position 2, 4, or 5
- Use new common letters like L, C, D, etc.

A word that satisfies these constraints and uses new common letters is “COULD”:
- C, L, D are new common letters.
- O is in position 2 (but we know O can’t be in position 2 from arose feedback). Oops, conflict.

Another candidate: “BLOOM” – but O is in position 2 again, which is invalid.

Next: “GLOOM” – same issue with O in position 2.

Try “CLOUD”:
- C, L, D new.
- O in position 2 – again invalid.

Try “MOPPY” – but P is repeated and Y is less common.

Try “DOING” – N is already ruled out.

Try “PILOT” – T is ruled out.

Try “COPED” – E is ruled out.

Try “BOPPY” – same as MOPPY with B.

Try “COPED” – E ruled out.

Try “GLOBE” – E ruled out.

Try “COBOL” – B and L new, O in position 2 invalid.

Try “POLYP” – P in position 1 is invalid (from point feedback P is not in position 1), and O in position 2 invalid.

Try “PODGY” – P in position 1 invalid.

Try “COULD” – O in position 2 invalid.

Try “FOULS” – S ruled out.

Try “COULD” again – same issue.

Let me think differently: since I is fixed in position 3, and O and P must be in the word, and O can’t be 2 or 3, and P can’t be 1, possible positions:
- O can be 4 or 5
- P can be 2, 4, or 5 (but can’t overlap with O)

Let’s try placing O in 4 and P in 2: _ P I O _ 
We need two more letters. Common ones: C, L, D, M, G, B, etc.

A word: “BPIOL” – not valid.

“CPIOL” – not valid.

“DPIOL” – not valid.

“GPIOL” – not valid.

“MPIOL” – not valid.

“YPIOL” – not valid.

Try O in 5 and P in 2: _ P I _ O
Word: “CPILO” – not valid.

“BPILO” – not valid.

Try O in 4 and P in 5: _ _ I O P
Word: “CLIOP” – not valid.

“DIROP” – not valid.

“GIROP” – not valid.

“LIROP” – not valid.

“MIROP” – not valid.

Try O in 4 and P in 2: “BPIOL” invalid.

Try O in 5 and P in 4: _ _ I P O
Word: “CLIPO” – not valid.

“DLIPO” – not valid.

“GLIPO” – not valid.

“HLIPO” – not valid.

“LIPOD” – not valid.

“MIPOD” – not valid.

This is tricky. Maybe use less common letters but still valid words.

Wait, let me list valid 5-letter words with I in position 3, containing O and P, avoiding banned letters (A, R, S, E, N, T).

Possible words:
- “PILOT” – T banned.
- “PODGY” – P in 1 invalid.
- “POLYP” – P in 1 invalid, O in 2 invalid.
- “COPED” – E banned.
- “BOPPY” – P in 1 invalid.
- “COBOL” – O in 2 invalid.
- “COULD” – O in 2 invalid.
- “FOULS” – S banned.
- “GLOBE” – E banned.
- “GOLLY” – L, Y new, O in 2 invalid.
- “GUMMY” – no P.
- “PIGGY” – G, Y new, P in 1 invalid.
- “PIKUP” – K, U new, P in 1 invalid.
- “PILOT” – T banned.
- “PIPIT” – T banned.
- “PIPPA” – A banned.
- “PIPPY” – P in 1 invalid.
- “PIQUE” – E banned.
- “PIRRE” – R, E banned.
- “PIRRO” – R banned.
- “PISSY” – S banned.
- “PITHY” – H, Y new, I in 3, P in 1 invalid.
- “PLIAR” – R banned.
- “PLIOC” – not a word.
- “PLIQU” – not a word.
- “PLUSH” – S banned.
- “PLYER” – R banned.
- “POKED” – E banned.
- “POLIS” – S banned.
- “POLIO” – O in 2 invalid.
- “PORCH” – R banned, H new.
- “PORCY” – R banned.
- “POSSE” – S, E banned.
- “POSSY” – S banned.
- “POUCH” – U, C, H new, O in 2 invalid.
- “POVET” – T banned.
- “POXED” – E banned.
- “POXIE” – E banned.
- “PRIMO” – R banned.
- “PRION” – R, N banned.
- “PRIZE” – R, Z, E banned.
- “PSALM” – S banned.
- “PSYCH” – S banned.
- “PUCKO” – C, K, O new, P in 1 invalid.
- “PUDDY” – D, Y new, no O.
- “PUDGY” – D, Y new, no O.
- “PUFFY” – no O.
- “PULPY” – no O.
- “PUPPY” – no O.
- “PURSY” – R banned, S banned.
- “PURTY” – R banned.
- “PUSKY” – S banned.
- “PUSSY” – S banned.
- “PUVXY” – not a word.

Hmm, many words with I in 3 are either invalid or use banned letters. Maybe “PIKUP” is the closest but P is in 1 which is invalid. 

Alternative approach: maybe O is in 4 or 5 and P is in 2, 4, or 5, and use new letters.

Let’s try “CPIOL” – invalid.

“MULCH” – no O.

Try “MULCT” – T banned.

Try “MULDO” – O in 5, D, L, C new, M new.

“MULDO” – valid word? Yes, “muldo” is a Scottish word for mottle, but might not be in Wordle list.

“MULDO” – questionable.

Try “MULCH” – no O.

Try “MULCT” – T banned.

Try “MULDO” – as above.

Try “MULDO” – let’s use it despite being Scottish.

But let’s think of more common words.

Wait, “MULCH” has no O.

Try “MULCT” – T banned.

Try “MULDO” – questionable.

Try “MULDO” – let’s use it.

But perhaps the word is “MULDO”.

However, “MULDO” might not be in Wordle’s list.

Let me try another approach: use O in 5 and P in 2 or 4.

Pattern: _ P I _ O or _ _ I P O

Word: “CPILO” – invalid.

But let me think of “PIKUP” – P in 1 invalid.

Word: “CLIOP” – invalid.

“GCLIOP” – invalid.

“MCLIOP” – invalid.

“YCLIOP” – invalid.

Try “BCLIOP” – invalid.

Try “FCLIOP” – invalid.

This seems impossible. Maybe the word is “MULDO”.

But let me try “MULDO”.

However, “MULDO” is not a standard word. Let me think of “MULCH” – no O.

This is very limiting. Perhaps the word is “PIKUP” despite P in 1, but feedback says P is not in 1.

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback:

From point feedback:
- P(-) → P is in the word but not in position 1.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(✓) → I is in position 3.
- N(x) → N not in word.
- T(x) → T not in word.

So P must be in positions 2,3,4, or 5. But position 3 is I, so P must be in 2,4, or 5.

O must be in positions 1,4, or 5 (since it can't be 2 or 3).

I is fixed at 3.

So possible patterns:
- P in 2: _ P I _ _
- P in 4: _ _ I P _
- P in 5: _ _ I _ P
And O must be in 1,4, or 5 accordingly.

Let me try P in 2 and O in 1: O P I _ _

Try P in 4 and O in 1: O _ I P _
Word: “OPIUM” – U, M new, I in 3, P in 4, O in 1. But O is not in 2, so this is valid.

“OPIUM” – valid word.

Check letters:
- O: in word, position 1 (ok, not 2 or 3)
- P: in word, position 4 (ok, not 1)
- I: position 3 (matches)
- U, M: new letters to test
- No banned letters (A, R, S, E, N, T)

This seems valid.

<guess>opium</guess>
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- I is locked in position 3.
- O and P are in the word but not in positions 2 or 1 respectively.
- We need to test new common letters (U, M) while placing O and P in valid positions.

A valid placement is O in position 1 and P in position 4, giving the word ""opium"".

<guess>opium</guess>",opium,"From the new feedback on “point”:

- P(-) → P is in the word but not in position 1.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 2 (and we already knew it’s not in position 3).
- I(✓) → I is in the word and is in position 3.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.
- T(x) → T is not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word has the pattern: _ _ I _ _  (I is locked in position 3).
- The letters O and P are in the word but not in positions 2 or 1 respectively.
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, S, E, N, T.

We still need to test common consonants like L, C, D, M, G, B, and vowels U (since A, E, O are either ruled out or in the word). We should place O and P in new positions to confirm their locations.

A good next guess would place:
- O in position 4 or 5 (since it can’t be 2 or 3)
- P in position 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is already I), so position 2, 4, or 5
- Use new common letters like L, C, D, etc.

A word that satisfies these constraints and uses new common letters is “COULD”:
- C, L, D are new common letters.
- O is in position 2 (but we know O can’t be in position 2 from arose feedback). Oops, conflict.

Another candidate: “BLOOM” – but O is in position 2 again, which is invalid.

Next: “GLOOM” – same issue with O in position 2.

Try “CLOUD”:
- C, L, D new.
- O in position 2 – again invalid.

Try “MOPPY” – but P is repeated and Y is less common.

Try “DOING” – N is already ruled out.

Try “PILOT” – T is ruled out.

Try “COPED” – E is ruled out.

Try “BOPPY” – same as MOPPY with B.

Try “COPED” – E ruled out.

Try “GLOBE” – E ruled out.

Try “COBOL” – B and L new, O in position 2 invalid.

Try “POLYP” – P in position 1 is invalid (from point feedback P is not in position 1), and O in position 2 invalid.

Try “PODGY” – P in position 1 invalid.

Try “COULD” – O in position 2 invalid.

Try “FOULS” – S ruled out.

Try “COULD” again – same issue.

Let me think differently: since I is fixed in position 3, and O and P must be in the word, and O can’t be 2 or 3, and P can’t be 1, possible positions:
- O can be 4 or 5
- P can be 2, 4, or 5 (but can’t overlap with O)

Let’s try placing O in 4 and P in 2: _ P I O _ 
We need two more letters. Common ones: C, L, D, M, G, B, etc.

A word: “BPIOL” – not valid.

“HLIPO” – not valid.

This is tricky. Maybe use less common letters but still valid words.

Hmm, many words with I in 3 are either invalid or use banned letters. Maybe “PIKUP” is the closest but P is in 1 which is invalid. 

Alternative approach: maybe O is in 4 or 5 and P is in 2, 4, or 5, and use new letters.

This seems impossible. Maybe the word is “MULDO”.

But let me try “MULDO”.

However, “MULDO” is not a standard word. Let me think of “MULCH” – no O.

This is very limiting. Perhaps the word is “PIKUP” despite P in 1, but feedback says P is not in 1.

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback:

From point feedback:
- P(-) → P is in the word but not in position 1.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(✓) → I is in position 3.
- N(x) → N not in word.
- T(x) → T not in word.

So P must be in positions 2,3,4, or 5. But position 3 is I, so P must be in 2,4, or 5.

O must be in positions 1,4, or 5 (since it can't be 2 or 3).

I is fixed at 3.

So possible patterns:
- P in 2: _ P I _ _
- P in 4: _ _ I P _
- P in 5: _ _ I _ P
And O must be in 1,4, or 5 accordingly.

Let me try P in 2 and O in 1: O P I _ _
Word: “OPINE” – E banned.

“OPINE” – E banned.

“OPINE” – E banned.

“OPINE” – E banned.

“OPINE” – E banned.

Try P in 2 and O in 4: _ P I O _
Word: “BPIOL” – invalid.

“CPIOL” – invalid.

“DPIOL” – invalid.

“GPIOL” – invalid.

“MPIOL” – invalid.

“YPIOL” – invalid.

Try P in 2 and O in 5: _ P I _ O
Word: “CPILO” – invalid.

“DPILO” – invalid.

“GPILO” – invalid.

“MPILO” – invalid.

“YPILO” – invalid.

Try P in 4 and O in 1: O _ I P _
Word: “OPIUM” – U, M new, I in 3, P in 4, O in 1. But O is not in 2, so this is valid.

“OPIUM” – valid word.

Check letters:
- O: in word, position 1 (ok, not 2 or 3)
- P: in word, position 4 (ok, not 1)
- I: position 3 (matches)
- U, M: new letters to test
- No banned letters (A, R, S, E, N, T)

This seems valid.

<guess>opium</guess>Based on the feedback:
- I is locked in position 3.
- O and P are in the word but not in positions 2 or 1 respectively.
- We need to test new common letters (U, M) while placing O and P in valid positions.

A valid placement is O in position 1 and P in position 4, giving the word ""opium"".",Guess 3: opium -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) P(✓) I(✓) U(✓) M(✓),SUCCESS
