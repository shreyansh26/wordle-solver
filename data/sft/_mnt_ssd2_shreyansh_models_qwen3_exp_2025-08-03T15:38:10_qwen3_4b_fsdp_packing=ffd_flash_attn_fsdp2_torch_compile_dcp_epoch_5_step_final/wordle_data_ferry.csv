For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage of frequent letters in English words.

Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out, and E is already known)

- R (position 3, but we know R must be in position 4 – oops, conflict!)

Let’s try “BERGY”:
- B (new letter)
- E (position 2)
- R (position 3 – again conflict with R needing to be in 4)

Let’s try “FERGY”:
- F (new letter)
- E (position 2)
- R (position 3 – still conflict)

Let’s try “VERGE”:
- V (new letter)
- E (position 2)

Let’s try “PERKY” again but adjust: we need R in 4, Y in 5, E somewhere else.  
Try “EPIRY”:
- E (position 1 – but E cannot be in 1)
- P (new)
- I (new)
- R (position 4 – correct)
- Y (position 5 – correct)

But E is in position 1 which is invalid.  
Try “PIERY”:
- P
- I
- E (position 3)
- R (position 4)
- Y (position 5)

This works:
- R is in position 4 (✓)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)
- E is in position 3 (allowed, since it’s not in 1 or 5)
- No A, O, S, N, T
- Uses new letters P, I

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

Letters definitely present:
- R in position 4
- Y in position 5
- E somewhere, but NOT in positions 1, 3, or 5 (from “arose” and “piery” feedback)

Letters definitely absent:
A, O, S, N, T, P, I

So the word has the pattern: _ _ _ R Y  
and must contain E in position 2 or 4.  
But position 4 is already R, so E must be in position 2.

Thus the pattern is: _ E _ R Y

We need a 5-letter word fitting this pattern, using only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible consonants left (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, etc.
Possible vowels left: U (since A, O, I are out and E is used)

Let’s try to fill position 1 and 3 with allowed letters.

Option 1: position 1 = B, position 3 = U → B E U R Y → “beury” – not a valid word.
Option 2: position 1 = C, position 3 = U → C E U R Y → “ceury” – not valid.
Option 3: position 1 = D, position 3 = U → D E U R Y → “deury” – not valid.
Option 4: position 1 = F, position 3 = U → F E U R Y → “feury” – not valid.
Option 5: position 1 = G, position 3 = U → G E U R Y → “geury” – not valid.
Option 6: position 1 = H, position 3 = U → H E U R Y → “heury” – not valid.
Option 7: position 1 = K, position 3 = U → K E U R Y → “keury” – not valid.
Option 8: position 1 = L, position 3 = U → L E U R Y → “leury” – not valid.
Option 9: position 1 = M, position 3 = U → M E U R Y → “meury” – not valid.
Option 10: position 1 = V, position 3 = U → V E U R Y → “veury” – not valid.

Let’s try position 3 = another consonant (no U needed since we’ve used vowels).  
We need a valid English word _ E _ R Y.

Valid words fitting _ E _ R Y:
- BEERY – but B is allowed and E is in 2, R in 4, Y in 5.  
  Check letters: B, E, E, R, Y – all allowed (no A, O, S, N, T, P, I).  
  This seems valid.

Another candidate: FEERY – but F is allowed, but “feery” is less common.  
Another: HEERY – H is allowed, but again less common.  
BEERY is the most straightforward valid word.

Let’s go with BEERY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage of frequent letters in English words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(x) → A is not in the word at all.
- R(-) → R is in the word, but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word, but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S
- Letters definitely present: R, E
- Positions to avoid for R: position 2
- Positions to avoid for E: position 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both R and E
- Does not contain A, O, S
- R is not in position 2
- E is not in position 5

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out, and E is already known)

Let’s try a word that uses R and E in new positions and introduces new common letters.  
“ENTRY” fits:
- Contains R (position 3) and E (position 2)
- Uses new letters N, T, Y
- Avoids A, O, S
- R is not in position 2 (✓), E is not in position 5 (✓)

This should give us more information about N, T, Y, and confirm positions for R and E.

- Has Y in position 5
- Contains E but not in position 1 or 5

Remaining common consonants to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out, and E is already known)

Let’s try to place E in position 2 or 3.  
A good candidate is “PERKY”:
- P (new letter)
- E (in position 2, which is allowed)
- R (position 3, but we know R must be in position 4 – oops, conflict!)

From the latest feedback on “beery”:

- B(x) → B is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 2.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 3 (we already know it’s in position 2, so this confirms no second E).
- R(✓) → R is in the word and in position 4.
- Y(✓) → Y is in the word and in position 5.

So the word has the fixed pattern: _ E _ R Y  
and we have ruled out these letters entirely: A, O, S, N, T, P, I, B.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that matches the pattern _ E _ R Y using only letters not yet excluded.

Remaining common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, V, W, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (only one vowel left to place).

The third letter must be a consonant (since we’ve used E, R, Y and only U is left as vowel).  
So the word is of the form: ? E ? R Y where ? is any allowed consonant.

Valid English words fitting this pattern:
- C E U R Y → “ceury” – not valid.
- C E D R Y → “cedry” – not valid.
- C E L R Y → “celry” – not valid.
- F E U R Y → “feury” – not valid.
- F E D R Y → “fedry” – not valid.
- F E L R Y → “felry” – not valid.
- H E U R Y → “heury” – not valid.
- H E D R Y → “hedry” – not valid.
- H E L R Y → “helry” – not valid.
- K E U R Y → “keury” – not valid.
- K E D R Y → “kedry” – not valid.
- K E L R Y → “keldry” – too long.
- L E U R Y → “leury” – not valid.
- L E D R Y → “ledry” – not valid.
- L E F R Y → “lefr y” – not valid.
- M E U R Y → “meury” – not valid.
- M E D R Y → “medry” – not valid.
- M E L R Y → “melry” – not valid.
- V E U R Y → “veury” – not valid.
- V E D R Y → “vedry” – not valid.
- V E L R Y → “velry” – not valid.
- W E U R Y → “weury” – not valid.
- W E D R Y → “wedry” – not valid.
- W E L R Y → “welry” – not valid.

Wait, let me think differently: maybe the third letter is a consonant and we don’t need U.  
Looking for common _ E _ R Y words:

- F E R R Y – but we already have R in position 4 and Y in 5, so “ferry” would be F E R R Y – but that has R twice, which is allowed, but we’ve already ruled out T, N, P, I, A, O, S, B.  
  Letters in “ferry”: F, E, R, R, Y – all allowed (F not ruled out).  
  Pattern: _ E _ R Y → F E R R Y fits (positions 2=E, 4=R, 5=Y).  
  But we have R already in position 4; a second R is allowed.

Is “ferry” a valid guess? Yes, it’s a common word.

Let me check if there are any other options.  
Another possibility: “derry” – but D is allowed, but we have Y in position 5, so D E R R Y – but that would have R in 3 and 4, which is possible, but “derry” is usually D E R R Y – but we have Y in 5, so that would be D E R R Y – but we already have Y in 5, so this would be D E R R Y – but our pattern is _ E _ R Y, so D E R R Y would be D(1) E(2) R(3) R(4) Y(5) – but we know R must be in 4, so this would be D E R R Y – but R is in 3 and 4, which is allowed.  
But we have not ruled out D yet.

Between “ferry” and “derry”, both are valid, but “ferry” is more common.

I’ll go with “ferry”.
