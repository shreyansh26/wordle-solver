For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first word should use several of these. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This gives us maximum coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters, which should provide good feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

Other good alternatives might be ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""RAISE,"" but ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong with its combination of vowels and common consonants.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x)
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:

We need a 5-letter word that:

Good letters to try next: common consonants and vowels we haven't ruled out. Remaining vowels: I, U. Common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A strong next guess would use new common letters while respecting the constraints. ""STEIN"" uses S and E but places them in new positions (S in 1st, E in 3rd) and introduces T, I, N. However, ""STEIN"" has E in 3rd which is allowed (only 5th was ruled out). 

Another option is ""STILE"" but that has E in 5th which is ruled out. ""STEED"" has E in 4th and 5th, which might be too many E's. ""STEIN"" seems best.

But let's check: S is in 1st (allowed), E is in 3rd (allowed), T, I, N are new letters. This should give good information.

From the latest feedback on ""suede"":

- The second E in position 5 is now in the word but in the wrong position (same as first feedback)

So the pattern is:
S _ E _ _

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N, U, D

Letters we know ARE in the word: S (position 1), E (position 3)

We still need two more distinct letters for positions 2 and 5, chosen from the remaining alphabet (excluding the forbidden ones).

Remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: none (only E is allowed, and it's already placed)

We need two different consonants for positions 2 and 5.

Possible combinations:
- Position 2: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
- Position 5: same list, excluding the one used in position 2

Let's think of common 5-letter words that fit S _ E _ _:

- SMEER: but R is forbidden  
- SPEER: R forbidden  
- SKEET: T forbidden  
- SHEER: R forbidden  
- SLEET: T forbidden

- SUEER: U forbidden  
- SPEEK: K is allowed  
- SMEER: R forbidden  
- SPEEL: already considered  
- SKEEK: K is allowed  

""SPEEK"" uses S, P, E, E, K. However, it has two E's, and we already have E in position 3. The second E would be in position 5, but feedback says E is in position 3 and now appears in position 5 as ""in word but wrong position"", so double E might not be valid (words typically don't have double letters unless allowed).

Another candidate: ""SPEEL"" — but it has double E as well.

""SMEEL"" — M and L are allowed, but double E.

""SKEEK"" — K is allowed, but double E.

""SKELL"" — L is allowed, but double E.

""SKENE"" — N is forbidden.

""SKELP"" — P is allowed, but double E.

""SKELT"" — T forbidden.

""SKELY"" — Y is allowed, but double E.

""SKELP"" — no double E, but has P.

Wait, ""SKELP"" is S-K-E-L-P, which fits S _ E _ _ with K and L and P. But we need two new letters for positions 2 and 5. Here positions 2 and 5 are K and P, which are new.

But ""SKELP"" is a valid word (though uncommon).

Another option: ""SPELK"" — but K is allowed, L is allowed.

But let's think of more common words: ""SHELF"" — F is allowed, H is allowed, but F is in position 5, H in position 2. That gives S H E L F — fits S _ E _ _, uses H and L and F.

Let's verify: S(✓) H(new) E(✓) L(new) F(new). No forbidden letters.

Yes, ""SHELF"" seems perfect.

Alternative checks:
- S H E L F: letters are S, H, E, L, F. None are in the forbidden list (A,R,O,T,I,N,U,D). E is in position 3, which matches the ✓, and S is in position 1 ✓. H and L are new letters to test, as well as F.

This seems optimal.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first word should use several of these. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This gives us maximum coverage of the alphabet's most frequent letters, which should provide good feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

Other good alternatives might be ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""RAISE,"" but ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong with its combination of vowels and common consonants.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x)
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O
- S is not in position 4, and E is not in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S and E
- No A, R, or O
- S not in 4th spot, E not in 5th spot

Good letters to try next: common consonants and vowels we haven't ruled out. Remaining vowels: I, U. Common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A strong next guess would use new common letters while respecting the constraints. ""STEIN"" uses S and E but places them in new positions (S in 1st, E in 3rd) and introduces T, I, N. However, ""STEIN"" has E in 3rd which is allowed (only 5th was ruled out). 

Another option is ""STILE"" but that has E in 5th which is ruled out. ""STEED"" has E in 4th and 5th, which might be too many E's. ""STEIN"" seems best.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing E (not in position 3), and using only allowed letters. Let's think of possibilities:

- S _ _ E _ : but E can't be in position 3, so this is allowed if E is in 4th
- S _ E _ _ : E in 3rd is disallowed
- S _ _ _ E : E in 5th is allowed

Possible words:

- SCENE: C and N, but N is disallowed
- SPEKE: P and K are allowed, E in 4th is allowed
- SKELE: K and L are allowed, E in 4th is allowed

Current constraints:

1. Pattern: S _ E L _
2. Letters known to be absent: A, R, O, T, I, N, U, D, H, F
3. Letters still allowed for position 2 and 5: B, C, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E is already placed in position 3, S in 1, L in 4)

We need two distinct consonants for positions 2 and 5.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit S _ E L _:

- S C E L L – but double L is possible and “SCELL” is a real word (though rare)
- S P E L L – double L, P allowed
- S W E L L – W and L, L is already in position 4, so double L would be position 5
- S K E L L – K and L, double L
- S M E L L – M and L, double L

The most common among these is “SPELL” (S-P-E-L-L), which uses P and L. Since L is already confirmed in position 4, the second L in position 5 would be consistent with the feedback (E was marked as “in word but wrong position” in position 5 previously, but that was before E was locked into position 3; now E is fixed in position 3, so the second letter in position 5 can be any allowed consonant).

However, “SPELL” has double L, which is acceptable.

Another candidate: “SHELL” – but H is forbidden.

“SWELL” – uses W and L, both allowed.

Between “SPELL” and “SWELL”, both fit perfectly. “SWELL” is slightly more common.

Let’s choose “SWELL”.
