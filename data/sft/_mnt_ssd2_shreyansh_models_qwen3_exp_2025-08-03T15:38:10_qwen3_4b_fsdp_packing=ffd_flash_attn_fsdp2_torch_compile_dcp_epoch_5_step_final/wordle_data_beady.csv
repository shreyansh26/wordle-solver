For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should ideally include several of these. 

Looking at combinations, ""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has no repeating letters, which helps test multiple possibilities. 

Another good option might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly effective due to the inclusion of O and S. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

4. We need to test remaining common letters that haven’t been ruled out: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:

- Introduce as many new, common, untested letters as possible in the remaining slots (positions 1, 4, 5).
- Avoid any already ruled-out letters (R, O, S, L, N, T).

Let’s pick a word that fits: “MEDIA” would use D, I, but A is already used and E is fixed.  
“HEADY” uses H, D, Y – all new letters.  
“CHAFF” uses C, H, F, F – but repeats F.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in the 1st position.

- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, S.
- Letters that ARE in the word but in unknown positions: A, E.
- We still need to test other common letters (T, L, N, I, C, etc.).

A good next guess would place A and E in new positions while introducing new common letters. Let’s try ""LEANT"":
- L: new letter, common.
- E: in word, now in 2nd position.
- A: in word, now in 3rd position.
- N: new letter, common.
- T: new letter, common.

This tests new positions for A and E and introduces L, N, T.

Let's update what we now know after four guesses.

1. Letters definitely NOT in the word:
   R, O, S, L, N, T, P, C, H, M, I

2. Letters that ARE in the word and already locked:
   - E is in position 2 (✓)
   - A is in position 3 (✓)

3. Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
   - D is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-)
   - A is already locked in position 3
   - E is already locked in position 2

4. Remaining untested common letters (alphabetically):
   B, F, G, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to fill positions 1, 4, 5 with letters from the remaining pool, ensuring:
- No duplicates
- No letters already ruled out
- D must appear somewhere (positions 1 or 5, since position 4 is excluded)

A good next guess should use D plus two new common letters. The simplest choice is:

D _ _ _ _  (but we need 5 letters total, and D is in position 1)

But we need to keep E in position 2 and A in position 3. So the pattern is:

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
?   E   A   ?   ?

We know D is in the word but not in position 4, so D must be in position 1 or 5.

Let's try D in position 1:

D E A _ _ 

Now we need two new letters for positions 4 and 5. From the remaining pool, common choices are B, F, G, K, U, V, W, Y.

Let's pick two new ones: B and K.

Possible word: DEABK (invalid - not a word)
DEAFK (invalid)
DEAGB (invalid)
DEAGK (invalid)
DEAGY (invalid)
DEAFY (invalid)

Better to pick real words. Let's try:

D E A B _ : need one more letter - DEAB_ - no valid word
D E A _ B : need one more letter - DE_A_B - possible words: DEAFB (invalid), DEAGB (invalid)

Actually, let's think of real words that fit DEA _ _:

DEAFY (but Y is allowed, F is allowed)
DEAFS (but S is ruled out)
DEAGY (but G is allowed, Y is allowed)

""DEAGY"" is not a common word. ""DEAFY"" is a valid word (meaning showing signs of being deaf).

But let's check if DEAFY uses any ruled-out letters:
D - allowed
E - locked in position 2
A - locked in position 3
F - allowed
Y - allowed

This seems valid.

Alternative: D E A K _ - DEAK_ - no common word
D E A V _ - DEAV_ - no common word
D E A G _ - DEAG_ - DEAGY is obscure

""DEAFY"" seems the best option.

But let me verify if D is allowed in position 1 - yes, D is not ruled out anywhere.

So the guess is DEAFY.

   - E in position 2.
   - A in position 3.
3. We still need to place A and E correctly (but they’re already locked in positions 2 and 3).
4. We need to test remaining common letters that haven’t been ruled out: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Keep E in position 2 and A in position 3.
- Introduce as many new, common, untested letters as possible in the remaining slots (positions 1, 4, 5).
- Avoid any already ruled-out letters (R, O, S, L, N, T).

Let’s pick a word that fits: “MEDIA” would use D, I, but A is already used and E is fixed.  
“HEADY” uses H, D, Y – all new letters.  
“CHAFF” uses C, H, F, F – but repeats F.  
“MEGA” is only 4 letters.  
“PEACH” uses P, C, H – all new, and keeps E and A in place.

“PEACH” is a valid 5-letter word that meets all constraints.

From the three rounds we have:

1. Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, S, L, N, T, P, C, H.
2. Letters that ARE in the word and already locked:
   - E in position 2
   - A in position 3
3. Remaining untested common letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.
4. We need to fill positions 1, 4, 5 with letters from the remaining pool, ensuring no duplicates and maximizing information.

A good next guess should:
- Keep E and A in their correct spots.
- Use three new, common letters for the other positions.
- Avoid any ruled-out letters.

Let’s try “MEDIA”:
- M, D, I are all new and common.
- E and A are already correct in positions 2 and 3.

This seems optimal.

Let's update what we now know after four guesses.

1. Letters definitely NOT in the word:
   R, O, S, L, N, T, P, C, H, M, I

2. Letters that ARE in the word and already locked:
   - E is in position 2 (✓)
   - A is in position 3 (✓)

3. Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
   - D is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-)
   - A is already locked in position 3
   - E is already locked in position 2

4. Remaining untested common letters (alphabetically):
   B, F, G, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to fill positions 1, 4, 5 with letters from the remaining pool, ensuring:
- No duplicates
- No letters already ruled out
- D must appear somewhere (positions 1 or 5, since position 4 is excluded)

A good next guess should use D plus two new common letters. The simplest choice is:

D _ _ _ _  (but we need 5 letters total, and D is in position 1)

But we need to keep E in position 2 and A in position 3. So the pattern is:

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
?   E   A   ?   ?

We know D is in the word but not in position 4, so D must be in position 1 or 5.

Let's try D in position 1:

D E A _ _ 

Now we need two new letters for positions 4 and 5. From the remaining pool, common choices are B, F, G, K, U, V, W, Y.

Let's pick two new ones: B and K.

Possible word: DEABK (invalid - not a word)
DEAFK (invalid)
DEAGB (invalid)
DEAGK (invalid)
DEAGY (invalid)
DEAFY (invalid)

Better to pick real words. Let's try:

D E A B _ : need one more letter - DEAB_ - no valid word
D E A _ B : need one more letter - DE_A_B - possible words: DEAFB (invalid), DEAGB (invalid)

Actually, let's think of real words that fit DEA _ _:

DEAFY (but Y is allowed, F is allowed)
DEAFS (but S is ruled out)
DEAGY (but G is allowed, Y is allowed)

""DEAGY"" is not a common word. ""DEAFY"" is a valid word (meaning showing signs of being deaf).

But let's check if DEAFY uses any ruled-out letters:
D - allowed
E - locked in position 2
A - locked in position 3
F - allowed
Y - allowed

This seems valid.

Alternative: D E A K _ - DEAK_ - no common word
D E A V _ - DEAV_ - no common word
D E A G _ - DEAG_ - DEAGY is obscure

""DEAFY"" seems the best option.

But let me verify if D is allowed in position 1 - yes, D is not ruled out anywhere.

So the guess is DEAFY.

The pattern so far is:

We know D must appear somewhere, and it cannot be in positions 1 or 4. The only remaining positions are 3 or 4, but 3 is already A. So D must be in position 4.

Wait, but position 4 is currently unknown. Let me check:
- Position 4 cannot be D because D is marked (-) in position 4 (from MEDIA feedback: D(-) means D is in the word but not in position 4).

So D cannot be in positions 1 or 4, and position 3 is A. The only remaining position for D is position 1.

But from DEAFY feedback, D(-) means D is in the word but not in position 1. So D cannot be in position 1 either.

This is a contradiction. Let me re-examine:

From MEDIA: D(-) means D is in the word but NOT in position 4.
From DEAFY: D(-) means D is in the word but NOT in position 1.

So D must be in the word, but positions 1 and 4 are excluded. The only remaining positions are 3, but position 3 is A. This suggests D cannot be placed, which means my earlier assumption might be wrong.

Wait, no - the letters in the word are E, A, Y, and D must appear once more. The word must contain D, E, A, Y plus one more letter.

But we have only 5 positions, and positions 2,3,5 are locked as E, A, Y. So the word must be:
[1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
D   E   A   ?   Y   (but D cannot be in position 1 from DEAFY feedback)

This seems impossible. Let me check the feedback again carefully:

DEAFY feedback: D(-) E(✓) A(✓) F(x) Y(✓)

The (-) on D means D is in the word but not in position 1. So D must be in position 4.
