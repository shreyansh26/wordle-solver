### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language. This helps maximize the chance of getting some feedback that can guide future guesses.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should include several of these. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes 5 of the most common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and common consonants.

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
   - R is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - A, I, S are absent.

2. TREND → T(x) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)
   - T, N, D are absent.
   - R is still in the word but not in position 2 (it was position 2 in TREND, so now it can’t be 1 or 2).
   - E is still in the word but not in position 3 (it was position 3 in TREND, so now it can’t be 1,3,5).

So the secret word:
- Must contain R and E.
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- E cannot be in positions 1,3,5.
- Cannot contain A, I, S, T, N, D.

Remaining common letters to try: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses only allowed letters.
- Places R in 3,4, or 5.
- Places E in 2 or 4 (since 1,3,5 are excluded for E).

Let’s try to place R in position 3 and E in position 2: _ E R _ _

Using common consonants and vowels we haven’t ruled out:
- O is still possible (it wasn’t in RAISE or TREND).
- L is still possible.
- M is still possible.

A word that fits: “COVER”
- C, O, V are new letters.

- R not in 1 or 2 – satisfies.

- No A, I, S, T, N, D – satisfies.

Let's consolidate everything we now know after the three guesses.

Letters we have tried so far:
R, A, I, S, E, T, N, D, C, O, V.

Letters that are NOT in the secret word (x feedback):
A, I, S, T, N, D, C, O, V.

Letters that ARE in the secret word (– feedback):
R and E.

Exact position constraints:
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 (from RAISE, TREND, COVER respectively).
  Therefore R must be in position 4 or 5.
- E cannot be in positions 1, 3, 5 (from RAISE, TREND, COVER respectively).
  Therefore E must be in position 2 or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both R and E.
2. R is in position 4 or 5.
3. E is in position 2 or 4 (and must coincide with R's position if both are in 4).
4. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.

Possible remaining letters (not yet tested and not ruled out):
B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's list valid placements:

Case 1: R in position 4
   Then E must be in position 2 (since 4 is taken by R and 5 is invalid for E).
   Pattern: _ E _ R _

Case 2: R in position 5
   Then E must be in position 2 or 4.
   Pattern: _ E _ _ R   or   _ _ E _ R

We need to fill the blanks with allowed letters.

Looking at case 1 (_ E _ R _):
Possible middle letters (positions 3 and 5) from remaining letters.
Let's try common consonants: B, F, G, H, L, M, P, etc.

Example: B E G R _  → but we need a valid word.
Looking for real words:
- BERET (but T is ruled out)
- BERRY (Y is allowed, but double R may not help)
- FEROC (C ruled out)
- GERMS (S ruled out)
- MERGE (G, M, E)
   MERGE: M, E, R, G, E.  Contains E twice, R once.  Letters are allowed:
   M (new), E (known), R (known), G (new), second E (allowed even though E is only required once, but double letters are possible).

But MERGE has E in position 2 and 4, which is fine because we know E must be in 2 or 4.

Check constraints:
- Contains R (position 3) and E (position 2) – but wait, in MERGE R is in position 3, which is allowed (R can be in 3,4,5 but we thought R must be in 4 or 5).  Actually MERGE has R in position 3, which was ruled out by RAISE (R cannot be in position 1), but position 3 is allowed.  Our earlier conclusion was R cannot be in 1,2,3 because:
   - RAISE: R not in 1
   - TREND: R not in 2
   - COVER: R not in 3
   So R must be in 4 or 5.  Therefore MERGE is invalid because R is in 3.

Let me re-examine:
From RAISE: R not in 1
From TREND: R not in 2
From COVER: R not in 3
Therefore R must be in 4 or 5.

So case 1 (_ E _ R _) is invalid because R must be in 4 or 5, and in this pattern R is in 4, which is allowed.  Wait, in MERGE R is in 3, which is invalid.  Let me think of a valid word with R in 4 or 5.

Case 1: R in 4, E in 2 → _ E _ R _
Looking for words:
- BEGUM (but U is allowed, M is allowed) → BEGUM: B, E, G, U, M.  But this lacks R.
- FEIGN (I is ruled out)
- HEWED (D is ruled out)
- LEVER (V is ruled out)
- MERIT (I, T ruled out)
- PERKY (Y allowed, but K is allowed) → PERKY: P, E, R, K, Y.  R is in 3, invalid.
- SERFS (S ruled out)
- WIDER (I, D ruled out)

Case 2: R in 5
   Then E must be in 2 or 4.
   Subcase 2a: E in 2 → _ E _ _ R
   Subcase 2b: E in 4 → _ _ E _ R

Subcase 2a: _ E _ _ R
Possible letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z
Looking for words:
- BELAR (not a valid word)
- BEGAR (not valid)
- BERG (too short)
- FEWER (W is allowed, but E is in 2, R in 5)
   FEWER: F, E, W, E, R.  Contains E twice, but this is allowed.  Check letters:
   F, E, W, E, R.  All letters are allowed (F, W not ruled out).  Pattern: F E W E R → E is in 2, R in 5.  This fits all constraints:
   - Contains R (5) and E (2)
   - R not in 1,2,3 (it's in 5) ✓
   - E not in 1,3,5 (it's in 2) ✓
   - No ruled-out letters ✓

Subcase 2b: _ _ E _ R
Looking for words:
- BEMER (not valid)
- FEMUR (U is allowed, M is allowed) → FEMUR: F, E, M, U, R.  Check:
   R is in 5 (allowed), E is in 3 (but E cannot be in 3) → invalid.
- GEMER (not valid)
- JERKY (Y allowed, K allowed) → JERKY: J, E, R, K, Y.  R is in 3 (invalid)
- MERGE (already saw R in 3 is invalid)
- PERKY (R in 3 invalid)

Thus the only valid candidate is FEWER.

But let me double-check FEWER:
Letters: F, E, W, E, R
- F: new, allowed
- E: known, in position 2 (allowed)
- W: new, allowed
- E: allowed even though E is only required once
- R: known, in position 5 (allowed)

This seems correct.

Another candidate could be:
- BERG (too short)
- BERGM (not a word)
- BERGAMOT (too long)
- BERGERS (too long)
- BERGON (not a word)
- BERGO (not a word)
- BERGAM (not a word)
- BERGAS (S ruled out)
- BERGONNE (too long)
- BERGOT (T ruled out)
- BERGOUD (too long)
- BERGOV (not a word)
- BERGON (not a word)
- BERGONDE (too long)
- BERGONDI (not a word)
- BERGONNE (too long)
- BERGONNE (too long)
- BERGONNE (too long)

No valid 5-letter words seem to fit _ E _ _ R except FEWER.

Thus, FEWER is the best next guess.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- R must be in position 4 or 5 (cannot be 1,2,3)
- E must be in position 2 or 4 (cannot be 1,3,5)
- Letters not allowed: A, I, S, T, N, D, C, O, V
- Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

The only valid placement that fits is:
- R in position 5
- E in position 2
- Pattern: _ E _ _ R

A valid word that fits this pattern is ""FEWER"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language. This helps maximize the chance of getting some feedback that can guide future guesses.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should include several of these. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes 5 of the most common letters (R, A, I, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and common consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 1).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 5).
- A, I, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains R and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- Does not contain A, I, or S.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has R somewhere (but not in position 1).
2. Has E somewhere (but not in position 5).
3. Does not contain A, I, or S.

Possible positions for R: 2,3,4,5  
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4  

Let's try a word that places R in position 2 and E in position 3, using other common letters.  
A good candidate is ""TREND"":
- T (new letter)
- R in position 2 (allowed)
- E in position 3 (allowed)
- N (common)
- D (common)

This avoids A, I, S and places R and E in new positions.

Guess 2: TREND -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
   - R is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - A, I, S are absent.

2. TREND → T(x) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)
   - T, N, D are absent.
   - R is still in the word but not in position 2 (it was position 2 in TREND, so now it can’t be 1 or 2).
   - E is still in the word but not in position 3 (it was position 3 in TREND, so now it can’t be 1,3,5).

So the secret word:
- Must contain R and E.
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.
- E cannot be in positions 1,3,5.
- Cannot contain A, I, S, T, N, D.

Remaining common letters to try: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses only allowed letters.
- Places R in 3,4, or 5.
- Places E in 2 or 4 (since 1,3,5 are excluded for E).

Let’s try to place R in position 3 and E in position 2: _ E R _ _

Using common consonants and vowels we haven’t ruled out:
- O is still possible (it wasn’t in RAISE or TREND).
- L is still possible.
- M is still possible.

A word that fits: “COVER”
- C, O, V are new letters.
- E in position 2, R in position 3.

Check constraints:
- Contains R (position 3) and E (position 2) – good.
- R not in 1 or 2 – satisfies.
- E not in 1,3,5 – satisfies.
- No A, I, S, T, N, D – satisfies.

This seems like a solid next guess.

B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's list valid placements:

Case 1: R in position 4
   Then E must be in position 2 (since 4 is taken by R and 5 is invalid for E).
   Pattern: _ E _ R _

Case 2: R in position 5
   Then E must be in position 2 or 4.
   Pattern: _ E _ _ R   or   _ _ E _ R

We need to fill the blanks with allowed letters.

Looking at case 1 (_ E _ R _):
Possible middle letters (positions 3 and 5) from remaining letters.
Let's try common consonants: B, F, G, H, L, M, P, etc.

Example: B E G R _  → but we need a valid word.
Looking for real words:
- BERET (but T is ruled out)
- BERRY (Y is allowed, but double R may not help)
- FEROC (C ruled out)
- GERMS (S ruled out)
- MERGE (G, M, E)
   MERGE: M, E, R, G, E.  Contains E twice, R once.  Letters are allowed:
   M (new), E (known), R (known), G (new), second E (allowed even though E is only required once, but double letters are possible).

But MERGE has E in position 2 and 4, which is fine because we know E must be in 2 or 4.

Check constraints:
- Contains R (position 3) and E (position 2) – but wait, in MERGE R is in position 3, which is allowed (R can be in 3,4,5 but we thought R must be in 4 or 5).  Actually MERGE has R in position 3, which was ruled out by RAISE (R cannot be in position 1), but position 3 is allowed.  Our earlier conclusion was R cannot be in 1,2,3 because:
   - RAISE: R not in 1
   - TREND: R not in 2
   - COVER: R not in 3
   So R must be in 4 or 5.  Therefore MERGE is invalid because R is in 3.

Let me re-examine:
From RAISE: R not in 1
From TREND: R not in 2
From COVER: R not in 3
Therefore R must be in 4 or 5.

So case 1 (_ E _ R _) is invalid because R must be in 4 or 5, and in this pattern R is in 4, which is allowed.  Wait, in MERGE R is in 3, which is invalid.  Let me think of a valid word with R in 4 or 5.

Case 1: R in 4, E in 2 → _ E _ R _
Looking for words:
- BEGUM (but U is allowed, M is allowed) → BEGUM: B, E, G, U, M.  But this lacks R.
- FEIGN (I is ruled out)
- HEWED (D is ruled out)
- LEVER (V is ruled out)
- MERIT (I, T ruled out)
- PERKY (Y allowed, but K is allowed) → PERKY: P, E, R, K, Y.  R is in 3, invalid.
- SERFS (S ruled out)
- WIDER (I, D ruled out)

Case 2: R in 5
   Then E must be in 2 or 4.
   Subcase 2a: E in 2 → _ E _ _ R
   Subcase 2b: E in 4 → _ _ E _ R

Subcase 2a: _ E _ _ R
Possible letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z
Looking for words:
- BELAR (not a valid word)
- BEGAR (not valid)
- BERG (too short)
- FEWER (W is allowed, but E is in 2, R in 5)
   FEWER: F, E, W, E, R.  Contains E twice, but this is allowed.  Check letters:
   F, E, W, E, R.  All letters are allowed (F, W not ruled out).  Pattern: F E W E R → E is in 2, R in 5.  This fits all constraints:
   - Contains R (5) and E (2)
   - R not in 1,2,3 (it's in 5) ✓
   - E not in 1,3,5 (it's in 2) ✓
   - No ruled-out letters ✓

Subcase 2b: _ _ E _ R
Looking for words:
- BEMER (not valid)
- FEMUR (U is allowed, M is allowed) → FEMUR: F, E, M, U, R.  Check:
   R is in 5 (allowed), E is in 3 (but E cannot be in 3) → invalid.
- GEMER (not valid)
- JERKY (Y allowed, K allowed) → JERKY: J, E, R, K, Y.  R is in 3 (invalid)
- MERGE (already saw R in 3 is invalid)
- PERKY (R in 3 invalid)

Thus the only valid candidate is FEWER.

But let me double-check FEWER:
Letters: F, E, W, E, R
- F: new, allowed
- E: known, in position 2 (allowed)
- W: new, allowed
- E: allowed even though E is only required once
- R: known, in position 5 (allowed)

This seems correct.

Another candidate could be:
- BERG (too short)
- BERGM (not a word)
- BERGAMOT (too long)
- BERGERS (too long)
- BERGON (not a word)
- BERGO (not a word)
- BERGAM (not a word)
- BERGAS (S ruled out)
- BERGONNE (too long)
- BERGOT (T ruled out)
- BERGOUD (too long)
- BERGOV (not a word)
- BERGON (not a word)
- BERGONDE (too long)
- BERGONDI (not a word)
- BERGONNE (too long)
- BERGONNE (too long)
- BERGONNE (too long)

No valid 5-letter words seem to fit _ E _ _ R except FEWER.

Thus, FEWER is the best next guess.Based on the feedback:
- R must be in position 4 or 5 (cannot be 1,2,3)
- E must be in position 2 or 4 (cannot be 1,3,5)
- Letters not allowed: A, I, S, T, N, D, C, O, V
- Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

The only valid placement that fits is:
- R in position 5
- E in position 2
- Pattern: _ E _ _ R

A valid word that fits this pattern is ""FEWER"".

Let’s tabulate everything we now know after four guesses.

Letters tried so far: R, A, I, S, E, T, N, D, C, O, V, F, W  
Letters that are NOT in the secret word (x feedback):  
A, I, S, T, N, D, C, O, V, F, W

Letters that ARE in the secret word (– or ✓ feedback):  
R, E  
Exact positional info from Guess 4 (FEWER):  
- E in position 2 is correct (✓).  
- R is in the word but NOT in position 5 (–).  
- E in positions 3 & 4 is wrong (–).  

So the secret word looks like:  
_ E _ _ _  
with R somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (since it can’t be 2 or 5).

Remaining unused letters (not yet ruled out):  
B, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 2.  
2. Contains R in position 1, 3, or 4.  
3. Uses only the still-allowed letters above.

Enumerate possible patterns:

Pattern 1: R E _ _ _  (R in 1)  
Possible letters for 3,4,5 from B, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, X, Y, Z  
Real words: REGMA (not common), REGXY (not a word), etc. – nothing obvious.

Pattern 2: _ E R _ _  (R in 3)  
Need a valid word:  
B E R G Y → “BERGY” (not a word)  
G E R M Y → “GERMY” (slang, but valid)  
H E R M Y → “HERMY” (not a word)  
L E R N Y → “LERNY” (not a word)

L E R K Y → “LERKY” (not a word)  
M E R K Y → “MERKY” (slang, but valid)  
P E R K Y → “PERKY” (valid word!)

Check PERKY:  
P (allowed), E (position 2, correct), R (position 3, allowed), K (allowed), Y (allowed).  
R is in position 3 (allowed, since R can’t be 2 or 5).  
All letters are still allowed.  
This is a valid candidate.

Pattern 3: _ E _ R _  (R in 4)  
Need a valid word:  
B E G R Y → “BEGRY” (not a word)  
B E M R Y → “BEMRY” (not a word)  
G E M R Y → “GEMRY” (not a word)  
H E M R Y → “Hemry” (not a word)  
L E M R Y → “LEMRY” (not a word)

L E K R Y → “LEKRY” (not a word)  
M E K R Y → “MEKRY” (not a word)  
P E K R Y → “PEKRY” (not a word)  

No valid words found in this pattern.

Pattern 4: _ E _ _ R  (R in 5)  
But feedback says R is NOT in position 5 (from FEWER: R(-)), so this is impossible.

Thus, the only valid candidate is PERKY.

Verify PERKY:
P (allowed), E (position 2, correct), R (position 3, allowed), K (allowed), Y (allowed).  
R is in position 3 (allowed).  
All constraints satisfied.

G E R K Y → “GERKY” (not a word)  
H E R K Y → “HERKY” (not a word)  
L E R K Y → “LERKY” (not a word)  
M E R K Y → “MERKY” (slang, but valid)  
P E R K Y → “PERKY” (valid word!)

Check PERKY:  
P (allowed), E (position 2, correct), R (position 3, allowed), K (allowed), Y (allowed).  
R is in position 3 (allowed, since R can’t be 2 or 5).  
All letters are still allowed.  
This is a valid candidate.

Pattern 3: _ E _ R _  (R in 4)  
Need a valid word:  
B E G R Y → “BEGRY” (not a word)  
B E M R Y → “BEMRY” (not a word)  
G E M R Y → “GEMRY” (not a word)  
H E M R Y → “Hemry” (not a word)  
L E M R Y → “LEMRY” (not a word)  
M E G R Y → “MEGRY” (not a word)  
P E G R Y → “PEGRY” (not a word)  
B E L R Y → “BELRY” (not a word)  
G E L R Y → “GELRY” (not a word)  
H E L R Y → “HELRY” (not a word)  
L E G R Y → “LEGRY” (not a word)  
M E L R Y → “MELRY” (not a word)  
P E L R Y → “PELRY” (not a word)  
B E H R Y → “BEHRY” (not a word)  
G E H R Y → “GEHRY” (not a word)  
L E H R Y → “LEHRY” (not a word)  
M E H R Y → “MEHRY” (not a word)  
P E H R Y → “PEHRY” (not a word)  
B E K R Y → “BEKRY” (not a word)  
G E K R Y → “GEKRY” (not a word)  
L E K R Y → “LEKRY” (not a word)  
M E K R Y → “MEKRY” (not a word)  
P E K R Y → “PEKRY” (not a word)  

No valid words found in this pattern.

Pattern 4: _ E _ _ R  (R in 5)  
But feedback says R is NOT in position 5 (from FEWER: R(-)), so this is impossible.

Thus, the only valid candidate is PERKY.

Verify PERKY:
P (allowed), E (position 2, correct), R (position 3, allowed), K (allowed), Y (allowed).  
R is in position 3 (allowed).  
All constraints satisfied.",Guess 5: PERKY -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) E(✓) R(✓) K(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
