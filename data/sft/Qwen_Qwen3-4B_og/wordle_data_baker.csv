Okay, let's see. I need to guess a 5-letter word. The user hasn't given any feedback yet, so I have to make an educated guess. Since there's no feedback, maybe I should pick a common 5-letter word that's likely to be the secret word. Words like ""apple"", ""water"", ""stone"", or ""green"" come to mind. But I should consider that the secret word could be anything. Maybe ""crane"" or ""brain""? Wait, but I need to make sure it's a valid 5-letter English word. Let me think of some common ones. ""Apple"" is a good choice because it's common and has letters that might be useful. Alternatively, ""stone"" is another common word. Hmm. Maybe ""crane"" is less common but still valid. Wait, the first guess should be something that can give useful feedback if it's wrong. Let me go with ""apple"" as the first guess. If the feedback comes back with some letters correct, that would help. But if not, maybe I need to adjust. Alternatively, maybe ""brain"" is better. Wait, but I need to pick one. Let me go with ""apple"" as the first guess.

Okay, let me think. The first guess was ""APPLE"" and the feedback was A(-), P(x), P(x), L(x), E(-). So, breaking that down:

- The letter A is in the word but in the wrong position. So A is present but not in the first position.
- P is not in the word at all. So both P's in APPLE are incorrect.
- L is not in the word. So the fourth letter L is wrong.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position. So E is present but not in the fifth position.

So the secret word has A and E, but not P, L. Also, A is not in the first position, and E is not in the fifth. Let me note that down.

Possible letters: A and E are in the word. The other letters must be from the remaining letters, excluding P and L. Let's think about possible 5-letter words that include A and E, and don't have P or L.

Possible letters: Let's consider the positions. The secret word is 5 letters. Let's think about where A and E can be. Since A is in the word but not in position 1 (from the feedback), it could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. But E is in the word but not in position 5, so E must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

So possible letters: Let's think of words that have A and E, and don't have P or L. For example, ""BEAST"" has B, E, A, S, T. But does that fit? Let's check. But wait, the feedback says that E is in the word but not in position 5. In ""BEAST"", E is in position 2, which is allowed. But does that fit with the other letters? Also, A is in position 3. But the feedback said A is in the word but in the wrong position. Wait, the first guess was APPLE, which had A in position 1. The feedback says A is in the word but in the wrong position, so in the secret word, A is not in position 1. So if the secret word is BEAST, then A is in position 3, which is correct. But then, the feedback for A would be (-), which matches. Also, E is in position 2, which is not position 5, so that's okay. But does the secret word have other letters? Let me check if BEAST is a possible candidate. However, the secret word could be another word. Let me think of other possibilities.

Another possibility: ""BRAKE"". Let's see. B, R, A, K, E. But does that fit? The feedback says that P is not in the word, which is true here. L is not in the word, which is also true. A is in position 3, which is not position 1, so that's okay. E is in position 5, but the feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. Wait, that's a problem. So if E is in position 5, that would conflict with the feedback. Therefore, BRAKE is invalid because E would be in position 5, which is not allowed. So that's out.

Another word: ""BEACH"". B, E, A, C, H. Let's check. A is in position 3 (not position 1), which is okay. E is in position 2 (not position 5), which is okay. P and L are not present. So that's possible. But is BEACH a valid word? Yes. Alternatively, ""BEAST"" as mentioned earlier. But let's think of other words. Maybe ""BEAST"" is possible. But let's check the feedback again. The first guess was APPLE, which had A in position 1, which was wrong. So the secret word has A in another position. E is in the word but not in position 5. So possible words could be ""BEAST"", ""BEACH"", ""BRAKE"" (but E in position 5 is invalid), ""BRAVE"" (but P is in the word, which is invalid). Wait, the feedback said P is not in the word. So any word with P is invalid. So ""BRAVE"" is out. So possible words: ""BEAST"", ""BEACH"", ""BASTE"" (but that's not a word), ""BEGET"" (has G, E, T, but A? No, BEGET is B, E, G, E, T. No A. So that's not. So maybe ""BEAST"" is a good candidate. But how to confirm?

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""STAGE"". Let's check. S, T, A, G, E. A is in position 3 (not 1), E is in position 5. But the feedback says E is not in position 5. So that's invalid. So ""STAGE"" is out. Another word: ""STARE"". S, T, A, R, E. E is in position 5, which is invalid. So that's out. How about ""STAGE"" again? No, same problem. What about ""STAGE"" is invalid. So maybe ""BEAST"" is a possibility. But how to choose between BEAST and BEACH? Let's think of other words. Maybe ""BEGAN"" (B, E, G, A, N). A is in position 4, E in position 2. That's okay. But does that fit? Yes. So that's another possibility.

But since I need to make a guess, perhaps ""BEAST"" is a good choice. Alternatively, ""BEACH"" or ""BEGAN"". But I need to pick one. Let me think of another approach. The letters in the secret word are A, E, and three other letters not including P or L. So possible letters could be B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But need to form a 5-letter word. Let's think of words that have A and E. For example, ""BRAKE"" (but E is in position 5, which is invalid). ""BRAVE"" (has P, which is invalid). ""BRAID"" (has A and D, but no E. So no. ""BRAKE"" again. Hmm. ""BEGET"" (no A). ""BEAST"" (has A and E). ""BEACH"" (has A and E). ""BEGET"" (no A). ""BEGET"" is B, E, G, E, T. No A. So not. ""BEAST"" is B, E, A, S, T. That's valid. So maybe that's the word. Alternatively, ""BEACH"" is B, E, A, C, H. Both are possible. But how to choose?

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""STARE"" but that has E in position 5. Which is invalid. So no. So between BEAST and BEACH. Let me think of other possibilities. Maybe ""BASTE"" (but that's not a standard word). ""BASTE"" is a word, meaning to coat with a sauce. So B, A, S, T, E. That's 5 letters. So that's possible. But the feedback for the first guess was A(-), so A is in the word but not in position 1. In BASTE, A is in position 2. Which is allowed. E is in position 5, but the feedback says E is not in position 5. So that's invalid. So BASTE is out. So that's not possible. So BEAST is a better candidate. So maybe the secret word is BEAST. Let me go with that. But I need to make sure that the other letters are not P or L. BEAST has B, E, A, S, T. No P or L. So that's okay.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""BEGET"" but that doesn't have A. So no. So I think BEAST is a good candidate. So my next guess would be BEAST. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, BEAST is a valid 5-letter word. So I'll go with that.

Okay, let me think. The first guess was ""APPLE"" and the feedback was A(-), P(x), P(x), L(x), E(-). So, breaking that down:

- The letter A is in the word but in the wrong position. So A is present but not in the first position.
- P is not in the word at all. So both P's in APPLE are incorrect.
- L is not in the word. So the fourth letter L is wrong.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position. So E is present but not in the fifth position.

So the secret word has A and E, but not P, L. Also, A is not in the first position, and E is not in the fifth. Let me note that down.

Possible letters: A and E are in the word. The other letters must be from the remaining letters, excluding P and L. Let's think about possible 5-letter words that include A and E, and don't have P or L.

Possible letters: Let's consider the positions. The secret word is 5 letters. Let's think about where A and E can be. Since A is in the word but not in position 1 (from the feedback), it could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. But E is in the word but not in position 5, so E must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

So possible letters: Let's think of words that have A and E, and don't have P or L. For example, ""BEAST"" has B, E, A, S, T. But does that fit? Let's check. But wait, the feedback says that E is in the word but not in position 5. In ""BEAST"", E is in position 2, which is allowed. But does that fit with the other letters? Also, A is in position 3. But the feedback said A is in the word but in the wrong position. Wait, the first guess was APPLE, which had A in position 1. The feedback says A is in the word but in the wrong position, so in the secret word, A is not in position 1. So if the secret word is BEAST, then A is in position 3, which is correct. But then, the feedback for A would be (-), which matches. Also, E is in position 2, which is not position 5, so that's okay. But does the secret word have other letters? Let me check if BEAST is a possible candidate. However, the secret word could be another word. Let me think of other possibilities.

Another possibility: ""BRAKE"". Let's see. B, R, A, K, E. But does that fit? The feedback says that P is not in the word, which is true here. L is not in the word, which is also true. A is in position 3, which is not position 1, so that's okay. E is in position 5, but the feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. Wait, that's a problem. So if E is in position 5, that would conflict with the feedback. Therefore, BRAKE is invalid because E would be in position 5, which is not allowed. So that's out.

Another word: ""BEACH"". B, E, A, C, H. Let's check. A is in position 3 (not position 1), which is okay. E is in position 2 (not position 5), which is okay. P and L are not present. So that's possible. But is BEACH a valid word? Yes. Alternatively, ""BEAST"" as mentioned earlier. But let's think of other words. Maybe ""BEAST"" is possible. But let's check the feedback again. The first guess was APPLE, which had A in position 1, which was wrong. So the secret word has A in another position. E is in the word but not in position 5. So possible words could be ""BEAST"", ""BEACH"", ""BRAKE"" (but E in position 5 is invalid), ""BRAVE"" (but P is in the word, which is invalid). Wait, the feedback said P is not in the word. So any word with P is invalid. So ""BRAVE"" is out. So possible words: ""BEAST"", ""BEACH"", ""BASTE"" (but that's not a word), ""BEGET"" (has G, E, T, but A? No, BEGET is B, E, G, E, T. No A. So that's not. So maybe ""BEAST"" is a good candidate. But how to confirm?

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""STAGE"". Let's check. S, T, A, G, E. A is in position 3 (not 1), E is in position 5. But the feedback says E is not in position 5. So that's invalid. So ""STAGE"" is out. Another word: ""STARE"". S, T, A, R, E. E is in position 5, which is invalid. So that's out. How about ""STAGE"" again? No, same problem. What about ""STAGE"" is invalid. So maybe ""BEAST"" is a possibility. But how to choose between BEAST and BEACH? Let's think of other words. Maybe ""BEGAN"" (B, E, G, A, N). A is in position 4, E in position 2. That's okay. But does that fit? Yes. So that's another possibility.

But since I need to make a guess, perhaps ""BEAST"" is a good choice. Alternatively, ""BEACH"" or ""BEGAN"". But I need to pick one. Let me think of another approach. The letters in the secret word are A, E, and three other letters not including P or L. So possible letters could be B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But need to form a 5-letter word. Let's think of words that have A and E. For example, ""BRAKE"" (but E is in position 5, which is invalid). ""BRAVE"" (has P, which is invalid). ""BRAID"" (has A and D, but no E. So no. ""BRAKE"" again. Hmm. ""BEGET"" (no A). ""BEAST"" (has A and E). ""BEACH"" (has A and E). ""BEGET"" (no A). ""BEGET"" is B, E, G, E, T. No A. So not. ""BEAST"" is B, E, A, S, T. That's valid. So maybe that's the word. Alternatively, ""BEACH"" is B, E, A, C, H. Both are possible. But how to choose?

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""STARE"" but that has E in position 5. Which is invalid. So no. So between BEAST and BEACH. Let me think of other possibilities. Maybe ""BASTE"" (but that's not a standard word). ""BASTE"" is a word, meaning to coat with a sauce. So B, A, S, T, E. That's 5 letters. So that's possible. But the feedback for the first guess was A(-), so A is in the word but not in position 1. In BASTE, A is in position 2. Which is allowed. E is in position 5, but the feedback says E is not in position 5. So that's invalid. So BASTE is out. So that's not possible. So BEAST is a better candidate. So maybe the secret word is BEAST. Let me go with that. But I need to make sure that the other letters are not P or L. BEAST has B, E, A, S, T. No P or L. So that's okay.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""BEGET"" but that doesn't have A. So no. So I think BEAST is a good candidate. So my next guess would be BEAST. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, BEAST is a valid 5-letter word. So I'll go with that.

I need to guess a 5-letter word. The user hasn\'t given any feedback yet, so I have to make an educated guess. Since there\'s no feedback, maybe I should pick a common 5-letter word that\'s likely to be the secret word. Words like ""apple"", ""water"", ""stone"", or ""green"" come to mind. But I should consider that the secret word could be anything. Maybe ""crane"" or ""brain""? Wait, but I need to make sure it\'s a valid 5-letter English word. Let me think of some common ones. ""Apple"" is a good choice because it\'s common and has letters that might be useful. Alternatively, ""stone"" is another common word. Hmm. Maybe ""crane"" is less common but still valid. Wait, the first guess should be something that can give useful feedback if it\'s wrong. Let me go with ""apple"" as the first guess. If the feedback comes back with some letters correct, that would help. But if not, maybe I need to adjust. Alternatively, maybe ""brain"" is better. Wait, but I need to pick one.

The first guess was ""APPLE"" and the feedback was A(-), P(x), P(x), L(x), E(-). So, breaking that down:\n\n- The letter A is in the word but in the wrong position. So A is present but not in the first position.\n- P is not in the word at all. So both P\'s in APPLE are incorrect.\n- L is not in the word. So the fourth letter L is wrong.\n- E is in the word but in the wrong position. So E is present but not in the fifth position.\n\nSo the secret word has A and E, but not P, L. Also, A is not in the first position, and E is not in the fifth. Let me note that down.\n\nPossible letters: A and E are in the word. The other letters must be from the remaining letters, excluding P and L. Let\'s think about possible 5-letter words that include A and E, and don\'t have P or L.\n\nPossible letters: Let\'s consider the positions. The secret word is 5 letters. Let\'s think about where A and E can be. Since A is in the word but not in position 1 (from the feedback), it could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. But E is in the word but not in position 5, so E must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nSo possible letters: Let\'s think of words that have A and E, and don\'t have P or L. For example, ""BEAST"" has B, E, A, S, T. But does that fit? Let\'s check. But wait, the feedback says that E is in the word but not in position 5. In ""BEAST"", E is in position 2, which is allowed. But does that fit with the other letters? Also, A is in position 3. But the feedback said A is in the word but in the wrong position. Wait, the first guess was APPLE, which had A in position 1. The feedback says A is in the word but in the wrong position, so in the secret word, A is not in position 1. So if the secret word is BEAST, then A is in position 3, which is correct. But then, the feedback for A would be (-), which matches. Also, E is in position 2, which is not position 5, so that\'s okay. But does the secret word have other letters? Let me check if BEAST is a possible candidate. However, the secret word could be another word. Let me think of other possibilities.\n\nAnother possibility: ""BRAKE"". Let\'s see. B, R, A, K, E. But does that fit? The feedback says that P is not in the word, which is true here. L is not in the word, which is also true. A is in position 3, which is not position 1, so that\'s okay. E is in position 5, but the feedback says E is in the word but not in position 5. Wait, that\'s a problem. So if E is in position 5, that would conflict with the feedback. Therefore, BRAKE is invalid because E would be in position 5, which is not allowed. So that\'s out.\n\nAnother word: ""BEACH"". B, E, A, C, H. Let\'s check. A is in position 3 (not position 1), which is okay. E is in position 2 (not position 5), which is okay. P and L are not present. So that\'s possible. But is BEACH a valid word? Yes. Alternatively, ""BEAST"" as mentioned earlier. But let\'s think of other words. Maybe ""BEAST"" is possible. But let\'s check the feedback again.

Okay, let's see. The user has given feedback for two guesses. The first guess was APPLE, which had A(-), P(x), P(x), L(x), E(-). So, A is in the word but not in position 1, P is not in the word at all, L is not in the word, and E is in the word but not in position 5.

Then the second guess was BEAST, and the feedback was B(✓), E(-), A(-), S(x), T(x). So, B is correct in the first position (✓), E is in the word but not in position 2 (since the feedback for E is -), A is in the word but not in position 3 (since the feedback for A is -), S is not in the word (x), and T is not in the word (x).

So from the second guess, we know that B is correct in position 1. The secret word starts with B. Also, E is in the word but not in position 2. A is in the word but not in position 3. S and T are not in the word. Also, from the first guess, we know that P and L are not in the word. So the letters we can exclude are P, L, S, T. So the secret word has B as the first letter, and includes A and E (from the first feedback). Also, E is not in position 2, so E must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 1 is B, so E can't be there. So E must be in positions 3, 4, or 5. Also, A is in the word but not in position 3 (from the second guess feedback), so A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5. But wait, the first feedback said A is in the word but not in position 1. The second guess's feedback says A is in the word but not in position 3. So A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5. But since the secret word starts with B, positions 2, 3, 4, 5 are left. So A can be in 2, 4, or 5. Also, E is in the word but not in position 2, so E can be in 3, 4, or 5.

So the secret word is B _ _ _ _, with letters A and E in positions 2, 4, 5 (for A) and 3, 4, 5 (for E). Also, the letters not in the word are P, L, S, T. So possible letters for the remaining positions (positions 2, 3, 4, 5) are from the letters that are not P, L, S, T. Let's think of possible letters. The letters allowed are A, E, and others except P, L, S, T. So possible letters could be C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But the word must be 5 letters starting with B, and include A and E.

So possible words could be:

- B _ A _ E (positions 2, 3, 4, 5)
- B _ E _ A
- B E A _ _
- B _ _ E A
- etc.

But need to make sure that the letters are valid. Let's think of possible words. For example:

- ""BEACH"" (B, E, A, C, H). But in this case, E is in position 2, which is invalid because the feedback for E in the second guess was -, meaning E is not in position 2. So BEACH would have E in position 2, which is invalid. So that's out.

Another possibility: ""BEGET"" (B, E, G, E, T). But T is not allowed (from feedback), so that's out.

How about ""BEGET"" is invalid because of T. What about ""BEGET"" without T? No, that's not possible. Let's think of ""BEGET"" is B, E, G, E, T. T is in the word, but the feedback says T is not in the word. So that's invalid.

Another possibility: ""BEGET"" is out. How about ""BEAST""? Wait, the second guess was BEAST, which had feedback B(✓), E(-), A(-), S(x), T(x). So S and T are not in the word. So BEAST is invalid because S and T are in the word, but the feedback says they are not. So that's not possible.

So the secret word is B _ _ _ _, with A and E in the word. Let's think of words that start with B, have A and E, and don't have S, T, P, L.

Possible words:

- ""BAGEL"" (B, A, G, E, L). But L is not allowed (from first feedback), so invalid.
- ""BAGGY"" (B, A, G, G, Y). No E, so invalid.
- ""BEGET"" (has T, which is invalid).
- ""BEGET"" is out. How about ""BEGET"" without T? Not possible. What about ""BEGAN"" (B, E, G, A, N). That has E in position 2, which is invalid. So that's out.
- ""BEGAN"" is invalid because E is in position 2.
- ""BEGET"" is invalid. ""BEGET"" is out. What about ""BEGAN"" again? No. How about ""BEGAN"" is invalid. What about ""BEGAN"" is B, E, G, A, N. E is in position 2, which is invalid. So that's not allowed.

Hmm, maybe ""BEGAN"" is not allowed. Let's think of other words. How about ""BEGAN"" is invalid. What about ""BEGAN"" is not allowed. What about ""BEGAN"" is invalid. Maybe ""BEGAN"" is not the answer. What about ""BEGAN"" is not allowed. Let's think of other possibilities.

Another approach: Since the secret word starts with B, and includes A and E, and doesn't have S, T, P, L. Let's think of words like ""BAGEL"" (but L is invalid), ""BAGGY"" (no E), ""BEGET"" (T is invalid), ""BEGET"" is out. How about ""BEGAN"" (E in position 2, invalid). What about ""BEGET"" is invalid. Maybe ""BEGET"" is not allowed. What about ""BEGET"" is invalid. What about ""BEGET"" is invalid. Maybe ""BEGET"" is not allowed. What about ""BEGET"" is not allowed. Maybe I'm missing something here. Let's think again.

Wait, the secret word has A and E. From the first feedback, E is in the word but not in position 5. From the second guess, E is in the word but not in position 2. So E can be in position 3 or 4. Also, A is in the word but not in position 3 (from the second guess feedback). So A can be in position 2, 4, or 5. Let's try to construct the word.

Possible positions:

Position 1: B (confirmed)
Position 2: ?
Position 3: ?
Position 4: ?
Position 5: ?

We need to have A and E in the word. Let's try to place them.

Option 1: A in position 2, E in position 3. So the word would be B A E _ _. But what letters are allowed? The remaining letters can't be S, T, P, L. So possible letters for positions 4 and 5 could be C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Let's think of a word. For example, ""BAE"" as the first three letters. But that's not a valid word. Maybe ""BAKER"" (B, A, K, E, R). But K is allowed? Yes. But the secret word would be B A K E R. Let's check if that fits. But the feedback from the second guess (BEAST) had E in position 2 as -, so E can't be in position 2. In this case, E is in position 4, which is allowed. Also, A is in position 2, which is allowed (since the feedback said A is not in position 3, but position 2 is okay). So BAKER is a possibility. But is BAKER a valid word? Yes. But let's check if that's possible. However, the secret word might not be BAKER. Alternatively, maybe ""BAKER"" is the answer.

Another option: A in position 4, E in position 3. So the word would be B _ E A _. For example, ""BEGAN"" (B, E, G, A, N). But E is in position 2, which is invalid. So that's not allowed. Alternatively, ""BEGAN"" is invalid. What about ""BEGAN"" is invalid. How about ""BEGET"" is invalid. Another possibility: B _ E _ A. For example, ""BEGET"" is invalid because of T. What about ""BEGET"" is invalid. Maybe ""BEGET"" is not allowed. How about ""BEGET"" is invalid. Maybe ""BEGET"" is not allowed.

Alternatively, A in position 5 and E in position 3. So the word would be B _ E _ A. For example, ""BEGET"" is invalid. How about ""BEGET"" is invalid. Maybe ""BEGAN"" is invalid. Another possibility: ""BEGAN"" is invalid. What about ""BEGET"" is invalid. Hmm.

Alternatively, A in position 4 and E in position 5. But the feedback says E is not in position 5. So that's invalid. So E can't be in position 5. So E must be in position 3 or 4.

Another possibility: A in position 2 and E in position 4. So the word is B A _ E _. For example, ""BAKER"" (B, A, K, E, R). That's valid. Let's check if that fits. The letters are B, A, K, E, R. No S, T, P, L. That's allowed. So that's a possibility. But is BAKER the secret word? Or maybe another word.

Alternatively, ""BAGEL"" is invalid because of L. ""BAGGY"" is invalid because no E. ""BAKER"" is possible. Let's try that. So the next guess would be BAKER. Let's check if that's a valid word. Yes, BAKER is a valid 5-letter word. But I need to make sure that the letters are allowed. Since the secret word can't have S, T, P, L, and BAKER has K, A, E, R, which are allowed. So that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe ""BEGET"" is invalid, but ""BAKER"" is a good candidate. So I'll go with BAKER as the next guess.
</think>

<guess>BAKER</guess>",BAKER,"Okay, let's see. The user has given feedback for two guesses. The first guess was APPLE, which had A(-), P(x), P(x), L(x), E(-). So, A is in the word but not in position 1, P is not in the word at all, L is not in the word, and E is in the word but not in position 5.

Then the second guess was BEAST, and the feedback was B(✓), E(-), A(-), S(x), T(x). So, B is correct in the first position (✓), E is in the word but not in position 2 (since the feedback for E is -), A is in the word but not in position 3 (since the feedback for A is -), S is not in the word (x), and T is not in the word (x).

So from the second guess, we know that B is correct in position 1. The secret word starts with B. Also, E is in the word but not in position 2. A is in the word but not in position 3. S and T are not in the word. Also, from the first guess, we know that P and L are not in the word. So the letters we can exclude are P, L, S, T. So the secret word has B as the first letter, and includes A and E (from the first feedback). Also, E is not in position 2, so E must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 1 is B, so E can't be there. So E must be in positions 3, 4, or 5. Also, A is in the word but not in position 3 (from the second guess feedback), so A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5. But wait, the first feedback said A is in the word but not in position 1. The second guess's feedback says A is in the word but not in position 3. So A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5. But since the secret word starts with B, positions 2, 3, 4, 5 are left. So A can be in 2, 4, or 5. Also, E is in the word but not in position 2, so E can be in 3, 4, or 5.

So the secret word is B _ _ _ _, with letters A and E in positions 2, 4, 5 (for A) and 3, 4, 5 (for E). Also, the letters not in the word are P, L, S, T. So possible letters for the remaining positions (positions 2, 3, 4, 5) are from the letters that are not P, L, S, T. Let's think of possible letters. The letters allowed are A, E, and others except P, L, S, T. So possible letters could be C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But the word must be 5 letters starting with B, and include A and E.

So possible words could be:

- B _ A _ E (positions 2, 3, 4, 5)
- B _ E _ A
- B E A _ _
- B _ _ E A
- etc.

But need to make sure that the letters are valid. Let's think of possible words. For example:

- ""BEACH"" (B, E, A, C, H). But in this case, E is in position 2, which is invalid because the feedback for E in the second guess was -, meaning E is not in position 2. So BEACH would have E in position 2, which is invalid. So that's out.

Another possibility: ""BEGET"" (B, E, G, E, T). But T is not allowed (from feedback), so that's out.

How about ""BEGET"" is invalid because of T. What about ""BEGET"" without T? No, that's not possible. Let's think of ""BEGET"" is B, E, G, E, T. T is in the word, but the feedback says T is not in the word. So that's invalid.

Another possibility: ""BEGET"" is out. How about ""BEAST""? Wait, the second guess was BEAST, which had feedback B(✓), E(-), A(-), S(x), T(x). So S and T are not in the word. So BEAST is invalid because S and T are in the word, but the feedback says they are not. So that's not possible.

So the secret word is B _ _ _ _, with A and E in the word. Let's think of words that start with B, have A and E, and don't have S, T, P, L.

Possible words:

- ""BAGEL"" (B, A, G, E, L). But L is not allowed (from first feedback), so invalid.
- ""BAGGY"" (B, A, G, G, Y). No E, so invalid.
- ""BEGET"" (has T, which is invalid).
- ""BEGET"" is out. How about ""BEGET"" without T? Not possible. What about ""BEGAN"" (B, E, G, A, N). That has E in position 2, which is invalid. So that's out.
- ""BEGAN"" is invalid because E is in position 2.
- ""BEGET"" is invalid. ""BEGET"" is out. What about ""BEGAN"" again? No. How about ""BEGAN"" is invalid. What about ""BEGAN"" is B, E, G, A, N. E is in position 2, which is invalid. So that's not allowed.

Hmm, maybe ""BEGAN"" is not allowed. Let's think of other words. How about ""BEGAN"" is invalid. What about ""BEGAN"" is not allowed. What about ""BEGAN"" is invalid. Maybe ""BEGAN"" is not the answer. What about ""BEGAN"" is not allowed. Let's think of other possibilities.

Maybe ""BEGET"" is not allowed. What about ""BEGET"" is invalid. What about ""BEGET"" is invalid. Maybe ""BEGET"" is not allowed. What about ""BEGET"" is not allowed. Maybe I'm missing something here. Let's think again.

Wait, the secret word has A and E. From the first feedback, E is in the word but not in position 5. From the second guess, E is in the word but not in position 2. So E can be in position 3 or 4. Also, A is in the word but not in position 3 (from the second guess feedback). So A can be in position 2, 4, or 5. Let's try to construct the word.

Possible positions:

Position 1: B (confirmed)
Position 2: ?
Position 3: ?
Position 4: ?
Position 5: ?

We need to have A and E in the word. Let's try to place them.

Option 1: A in position 2, E in position 3. So the word would be B A E _ _. But what letters are allowed? The remaining letters can't be S, T, P, L. So possible letters for positions 4 and 5 could be C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Let's think of a word. For example, ""BAE"" as the first three letters. But that's not a valid word. Maybe ""BAKER"" (B, A, K, E, R). But K is allowed? Yes. But the secret word would be B A K E R. Let's check if that fits. But the feedback from the second guess (BEAST) had E in position 2 as -, so E can't be in position 2. In this case, E is in position 4, which is allowed. Also, A is in position 2, which is allowed (since the feedback said A is not in position 3, but position 2 is okay). So BAKER is a possibility. But is BAKER a valid word? Yes. But let's check if that's possible. However, the secret word might not be BAKER. Alternatively, maybe ""BAKER"" is the answer.

Another option: A in position 4, E in position 3. So the word would be B _ E A _. For example, ""BEGAN"" (B, E, G, A, N). But E is in position 2, which is invalid. So that's not allowed. Alternatively, ""BEGAN"" is invalid. What about ""BEGAN"" is invalid. How about ""BEGET"" is invalid. Another possibility: B _ E _ A. For example, ""BEGET"" is invalid because of T. What about ""BEGET"" is invalid. Maybe ""BEGET"" is not allowed. How about ""BEGET"" is invalid. Maybe ""BEGET"" is not allowed.

Alternatively, A in position 5 and E in position 3. So the word would be B _ E _ A. For example, ""BEGET"" is invalid. How about ""BEGET"" is invalid. Maybe ""BEGAN"" is invalid. Another possibility: ""BEGAN"" is invalid. What about ""BEGET"" is invalid. Hmm.

Alternatively, A in position 4 and E in position 5. But the feedback says E is not in position 5. So that's invalid. So E can't be in position 5. So E must be in position 3 or 4.

Another possibility: A in position 2 and E in position 4. So the word is B A _ E _. For example, ""BAKER"" (B, A, K, E, R). That's valid. Let's check if that fits. The letters are B, A, K, E, R. No S, T, P, L. That's allowed. So that's a possibility. But is BAKER the secret word? Or maybe another word.

Alternatively, ""BAGEL"" is invalid because of L. ""BAGGY"" is invalid because no E. ""BAKER"" is possible. Let's try that. So the next guess would be BAKER. Let's check if that's a valid word. Yes, BAKER is a valid 5-letter word. But I need to make sure that the letters are allowed. Since the secret word can't have S, T, P, L, and BAKER has K, A, E, R, which are allowed. So that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe ""BEGET"" is invalid, but ""BAKER"" is a good candidate. So I'll go with BAKER as the next guess.",Guess 3: BAKER -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) A(✓) K(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
