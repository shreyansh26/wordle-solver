Okay, I need to guess a 5-letter word. Let me think. Since I don't have any feedback yet, I should pick a common or versatile word that might have letters that could be in the secret word. Maybe something like ""CRANE"" because it's a common word and has different letters that might be useful. Alternatively, ""BRAIN"" is another common word. Wait, but maybe ""CRANE"" is better because it has a mix of vowels and consonants. Let me go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess. If the feedback comes back, I can adjust based on the symbols. But since I don't have any feedback yet, I just need to make an educated guess. Let's say the secret word is something like ""CRANE"" itself. But I'm not sure. Maybe ""CRANE"" is a good starting point.

Okay, let's see. The first guess was CRANE, and the feedback was C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓). So that means the letters C and E are in the word, but in the correct positions. Wait, no—wait, the feedback symbols: ✓ is correct position, - is wrong position, x is not in the word. So for CRANE, the feedback is C(✓), which means the first letter is correct. Then R(x) means R is not in the word. A(x) means A is not in the word. N(x) means N is not in the word. E(✓) means the fifth letter is correct. So the secret word has C as the first letter and E as the fifth letter. So the word is C _ _ _ E.

So now, I need to figure out the letters in between. Let's think. The secret word starts with C and ends with E. Let's think of 5-letter words that fit that pattern. Possible letters in the middle. Let's think of words like ""CARES"" but that ends with S. Wait, no. Wait, the fifth letter is E. So maybe ""CRIES""? But that's C R I E S. No, fifth letter is S. Not E. Hmm. Wait, maybe ""CONEY""? That's C O N E Y. No, fifth letter is Y. Not E. Wait, maybe ""CROSE""? Is that a word? Not sure. Or ""CRESS""? That's C R E S S. Ends with S. Not E. Wait, maybe ""CONEE""? But that's not a standard word. Or ""COPEN""? No, that's not a word. Wait, maybe ""CZECH""? No, ends with H. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the middle letters are something else. Let's think of words that start with C and end with E. Like ""CAMEO"" but that's 5 letters. C A M E O. Ends with O. Not E. Wait, ""COPEN"" is not a word. ""CROWN"" ends with N. ""CRANE"" was the first guess, but that had R and A and N which were marked as x. So R and A and N are not in the word. So the secret word is C _ _ _ E, with the second, third, and fourth letters not being R, A, N. Also, the letters in the middle can't be R, A, or N. So possible letters for the second, third, fourth positions.

Let me think of words that fit. Maybe ""COTER""? Not sure if that's a word. Or ""COEUR""? That's French for heart, but maybe not allowed. Or ""COPSE""? That's a word. C O P S E. Yes, that's a 5-letter word. COPSE means a small group of trees. So that would fit C _ _ _ E. Let me check if that's possible. But I need to make sure that the letters in the middle are not R, A, N. So in COPSE, the letters are C, O, P, S, E. So the second letter is O, third is P, fourth is S. None of those are R, A, or N. So that's possible. So maybe COPSE is a candidate. Alternatively, ""COEVE""? Not sure. Or ""CRESS""? No, ends with S. Wait, ""CRESS"" is C R E S S. But R is not allowed. So that's out. 

Alternatively, ""COPEN"" is not a word. Maybe ""CROSE""? Not sure. Or ""CENSE""? That's C E N S E. But N is not allowed. So that's out. Hmm. Another approach: think of words that end with E and start with C. Like ""CONE"" is 4 letters. ""CONES"" is 5 letters. But that's C O N E S. Ends with S. Not E. So that's not. Wait, ""CONEE"" is not a word. Maybe ""COTER""? Not sure. Alternatively, ""COPSE"" seems like a valid word. Let me check if that's a valid 5-letter word. Yes, COPSE is a word. So maybe that's the secret word. But I need to make sure that the letters in the middle are not R, A, N. So COPSE has O, P, S. None of those are R, A, or N. So that's possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CERES"". C E R E S. But that ends with S. Not E. Wait, ""CERES"" is 5 letters. No. Wait, ""CERES"" is C E R E S. Ends with S. Not E. So that's not. Wait, maybe ""CERES"" is not the right one. Alternatively, ""CEREB"" is not a word. Hmm. Maybe ""CENSE"" is C E N S E. But N is not allowed. So that's out. 

Alternatively, ""COBSE""? Not a word. ""COBSE"" is not valid. Maybe ""COEVE""? Not sure. Alternatively, ""COPSE"" seems like the best bet. So my next guess would be COPSE. Let's try that. If the feedback comes back, I can adjust. But since I don't have feedback yet, I need to make an educated guess. So I'll go with COPSE as the second guess.

So the secret word is C _ _ _ E, with the second, third, and fourth letters not being R, A, N. Also, the letters in the middle can\'t be R, A, or N. So possible letters for the second, third, fourth positions.\n\nLet me think of words that fit. Maybe ""COTER""? Not sure if that\'s a word. Or ""COEUR""? That\'s French for heart, but maybe not allowed. Or ""COPSE""? That\'s a word. C O P S E. Yes, that\'s a 5-letter word. COPSE means a small group of trees. So that would fit C _ _ _ E. Let me check if that\'s possible. But I need to make sure that the letters in the middle are not R, A, N. So in COPSE, the letters are C, O, P, S, E. So the second letter is O, third is P, fourth is S. None of those are R, A, or N. So that\'s possible. So maybe COPSE is a candidate. Alternatively, ""COEVE""? Not sure. Or ""CRESS""? No, ends with S. Wait, ""CRESS"" is C R E S S. But R is not allowed. So that\'s out. \n\nAlternatively, ""COPEN"" is not a word. Maybe ""CROSE""? Not sure. Or ""CENSE""? That\'s C E N S E. But N is not allowed. So that\'s out. Hmm. Another approach: think of words that end with E and start with C. Like ""CONE"" is 4 letters. ""CONES"" is 5 letters. But that\'s C O N E S. Ends with S. Not E. So that\'s not. Wait, ""CONEE"" is not a word. Maybe ""COTER""? Not sure. Alternatively, ""COPSE"" seems like a valid word. Let me check if that\'s a valid 5-letter word. Yes, COPSE is a word. So maybe that\'s the secret word. But I need to make sure that the letters in the middle are not R, A, N. So COPSE has O, P, S. None of those are R, A, or N. So that\'s possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CERES"". C E R E S. But that ends with S. Not E. Wait, ""CERES"" is 5 letters. No. Wait, ""CERES"" is C E R E S. Ends with S. Not E. So that\'s not. Wait, maybe ""CERES"" is not the right one. Alternatively, ""CEREB"" is not a word. Hmm. Maybe ""CENSE"" is C E N S E. But N is not allowed. So that\'s out. \n\nAlternatively, ""COBSE""? Not a word. ""COBSE"" is not valid. Maybe ""COEVE""? Not sure. Alternatively, ""COPSE"" seems like the best bet. So my next guess would be COPSE. Let\'s try that. If the feedback comes back, I can adjust. But since I don\'t have feedback yet, I need to make an educated guess. So I\'ll go with COPSE as the second guess.\n\n<guess>COPSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: COPSE -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(-) P(x) S(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
Okay, let's see. The previous guesses were CRANE and COPSE. The feedback for CRANE was C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓), so the secret word starts with C and ends with E. Then, for COPSE, the feedback was C(✓) O(-) P(x) S(x) E(✓). So that means the first letter is correct (C), the fifth is correct (E), the second letter O is in the word but in the wrong position (so O is present but not in the second position), the third letter P is not in the word, and the fourth letter S is not in the word.

So now, the secret word is C _ _ _ E. We know that O is present but not in the second position. Also, P and S are not in the word. So the letters we can use are other letters. Let's think about possible letters for positions 2, 3, 4.

We know that O is in the word but not in position 2. So O could be in position 3 or 4. Also, the letters in positions 2, 3, 4 can't be P or S. Also, from the first guess, R, A, N are not in the word. So possible letters for positions 2, 3, 4 are letters other than R, A, N, P, S. Also, O is allowed, but not in position 2.

So possible letters for position 2: maybe letters like T, L, M, etc. Let's think of words that fit C _ _ _ E with O in the word but not in position 2. For example, maybe ""COATE""? But that's C O A T E. Wait, but A is not allowed because in the first guess, A was marked as x. So A is not in the word. So COATE would have A, which is invalid. So that's out.

Another possibility: ""COTE"" is 4 letters. Maybe ""COTER""? But that's not a standard word. Alternatively, ""COEVE""? Not sure. Or ""COTED""? That's C O T E D, but ends with D, not E. Wait, the secret word ends with E. So maybe ""COEVE""? But that's C O E V E. Wait, that's 5 letters. Let me check: C O E V E. But the third letter is E. But the secret word's third letter is unknown. However, the feedback for COPSE indicated that O is in the word but not in position 2. So O could be in position 3 or 4. Let's think of words where O is in position 3 or 4.

Another approach: Let's think of words that start with C, end with E, have O somewhere else, and don't have P, S, A, R, N. Let's try ""COBRE""? No, that's Spanish. ""COBRE"" is not English. ""COBSE""? Not a word. ""COEVE""? Maybe. Or ""COEVE"" is a word? Not sure. Alternatively, ""COTLE""? That's a word, like a fish. C O T L E. But that's 5 letters. Let's check: C O T L E. The letters are C, O, T, L, E. So O is in position 2, but the feedback for COPSE said O is in the word but not in position 2. So that would be a problem. So if the secret word is COTLE, then O is in position 2, which contradicts the feedback from COPSE. Therefore, that's not possible.

Wait, the feedback for COPSE was O(-), meaning O is in the word but in the wrong position. So O can't be in position 2. So O must be in position 3 or 4. So let's try a word where O is in position 3. For example, ""CROSE""? But that's C R O S E. But R is not allowed (from first guess). So that's out. Alternatively, ""COOEE""? Not a word. ""COEVE"" as before. Maybe ""COEVE"" is a valid word? Not sure. Alternatively, ""COEVE"" might not be a standard word. Let's think of other possibilities.

Another idea: Maybe the secret word is ""CONEE""? But that's not a standard word. Or ""CONE"" plus an E? Not sure. Alternatively, ""COEVE"" might be a variant, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, think of words with O in position 3 or 4. For example, ""COTER"" is not a word. ""COTER"" might not be valid. ""COTER"" is a term in some contexts, but maybe not. Alternatively, ""COTLE"" is a word (a type of fish), but as mentioned, that would have O in position 2, which is not allowed.

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""CROSE""? But that has R, which is not allowed. So that's out. Alternatively, ""COEVE"" is possible. Let's try that. If I guess COEVE, but I need to check if that's a valid word. Alternatively, maybe ""COTSE""? Not sure. Alternatively, ""COTSE"" is not a word. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CERES""? But that ends with S. No. Wait, the secret word ends with E. So ""CERES"" is C E R E S, which ends with S. Not E. So that's out. Alternatively, ""CERES"" is not the right one.

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""COEVE"". Let me think. If the secret word is COEVE, then the letters are C, O, E, V, E. But that would mean the third letter is E, and the fourth is V. But in the feedback for COPSE, the third letter was P (which was marked as x), so P is not in the word. So that's okay. But is COEVE a valid word? I'm not sure. Maybe it's a variant or a less common word. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""COVEE""? But that's not a standard word. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""COTSE""? Not sure. Alternatively, think of ""COTSE"" as a possible word. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""COEVE"". If that's the case, then the letters would be C, O, E, V, E. But the feedback for COPSE said that O is present but not in position 2. In COEVE, O is in position 2, which would contradict the feedback. So that's not possible. Therefore, O must be in position 3 or 4.

So, let's think of a word where O is in position 3 or 4. Let's try ""COEVE"" again. Wait, O is in position 2. That's not allowed. So maybe ""COEVE"" is not the right one. How about ""COEVE"" is not possible. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the secret word is ""COTLE"", but that has O in position 2. Which is not allowed. So that's out. Alternatively, maybe ""COEVE"" is not correct. 

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""COTSE"". Let me check if that's a word. ""Cotse"" is a place name, but not a standard English word. Alternatively, ""COTSE"" might not be valid. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""COEVE"" but with O in position 3. Wait, that would be C _ O _ E. For example, ""COOEE""? Not a word. Or ""COOED""? That's C O O E D. Ends with D. Not E. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""COEVE"" but with O in position 3. So the word would be C _ O _ E. For example, ""CLOVE"". Wait, CLOVE is C L O V E. That's 5 letters. Let's check: C (correct), L (unknown), O (position 3), V (position 4), E (correct). But in the feedback for COPSE, the third letter was P (marked as x), so P is not in the word. But in CLOVE, the third letter is O, which is allowed. Also, the fourth letter is V, which is not in the word (from COPSE feedback, S is not in the word, but V is not mentioned). Wait, the feedback for COPSE was S(x), meaning S is not in the word. So V is allowed. So CLOVE would be a possible word. Let's check: CLOVE is a valid 5-letter word. So that's C L O V E. Let's check the feedback. 

If the secret word is CLOVE, then for the second guess COPSE, the feedback would be: C(✓) O(-) P(x) S(x) E(✓). Because O is in the word (position 3), but in the second guess, O was in position 2, so it's a wrong position. P is not in the word (correct), S is not in the word (correct). So that fits. Then, the third guess would be CLOVE. But wait, the user hasn't provided feedback for the third guess yet. So if I guess CLOVE, and if that's the secret word, then the feedback would be all ✓ for C and E, and the other letters would be correct. But since I don't have feedback yet, I need to make a guess. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CLOVE"". Let me think. So the third guess would be CLOVE. Let's try that. If that's the case, then the feedback would be C(✓), L(-), O(✓), V(-), E(✓). But I need to check if that's possible. Wait, the feedback for the second guess was O(-), meaning O is in the word but not in position 2. In CLOVE, O is in position 3, so that's correct. So that would fit. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CLOVE"". So my next guess would be CLOVE. Let's go with that.
</think>

<guess>CLOVE</guess>",CLOVE,"Okay, let's see. The previous guesses were CRANE and COPSE. The feedback for CRANE was C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓), so the secret word starts with C and ends with E. Then, for COPSE, the feedback was C(✓) O(-) P(x) S(x) E(✓). So that means the first letter is correct (C), the fifth is correct (E), the second letter O is in the word but in the wrong position (so O is present but not in the second position), the third letter P is not in the word, and the fourth letter S is not in the word.

So now, the secret word is C _ _ _ E. We know that O is present but not in the second position. Also, P and S are not in the word. So the letters we can use are other letters. Let's think about possible letters for positions 2, 3, 4.

We know that O is in the word but not in position 2. So O could be in position 3 or 4. Also, the letters in positions 2, 3, 4 can't be P or S. Also, from the first guess, R, A, N are not in the word. So possible letters for positions 2, 3, 4 are letters other than R, A, N, P, S. Also, O is allowed, but not in position 2.

So possible letters for position 2: maybe letters like T, L, M, etc. Let's think of words that fit C _ _ _ E with O in the word but not in position 2. For example, maybe ""COATE""? But that's C O A T E. Wait, but A is not allowed because in the first guess, A was marked as x. So A is not in the word. So COATE would have A, which is invalid. So that's out.

Another possibility: ""COTE"" is 4 letters. Maybe ""COTER""? But that's not a standard word. Alternatively, ""COEVE""? Not sure. Or ""COTED""? That's C O T E D, but ends with D, not E. Wait, the secret word ends with E. So maybe ""COEVE""? But that's C O E V E. Wait, that's 5 letters. Let me check: C O E V E. But the third letter is E. But the secret word's third letter is unknown. However, the feedback for COPSE indicated that O is in the word but not in position 2. So O could be in position 3 or 4. Let's think of words where O is in position 3 or 4.

The letters are C, O, T, L, E. So O is in position 2, but the feedback for COPSE said O is in the word but not in position 2. So that would be a problem. So if the secret word is COTLE, then O is in position 2, which contradicts the feedback from COPSE. Therefore, that's not possible.

Wait, the feedback for COPSE was O(-), meaning O is in the word but in the wrong position. So O can't be in position 2. So O must be in position 3 or 4. So let's try a word where O is in position 3. For example, ""CROSE""? But that's C R O S E. But R is not allowed (from first guess). So that's out. Alternatively, ""COOEE""? Not a word. ""COEVE"" as before. Maybe ""COEVE"" is a valid word? Not sure. Alternatively, ""COEVE"" might not be a standard word. Let's think of other possibilities.

Another idea: Maybe the secret word is ""CONEE""? But that's not a standard word. Or ""CONE"" plus an E? Not sure. Alternatively, ""COEVE"" might be a variant, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, think of words with O in position 3 or 4. For example, ""COTER"" is not a word. ""COTER"" might not be valid. ""COTER"" is a term in some contexts, but maybe not. Alternatively, ""COTLE"" is a word (a type of fish), but as mentioned, that would have O in position 2, which is not allowed.

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""CROSE""? But that has R, which is not allowed. So that's out. Alternatively, ""COEVE"" is possible. Let's try that. If I guess COEVE, but I need to check if that's a valid word. Alternatively, maybe ""COTSE""? Not sure. Alternatively, ""COTSE"" is not a word. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CERES""? But that ends with S. No. Wait, the secret word ends with E. So ""CERES"" is C E R E S, which ends with S. Not E. So that's out. Alternatively, ""CERES"" is not the right one.

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""COEVE"". Let me think. If the secret word is COEVE, then the letters are C, O, E, V, E. But that would mean the third letter is E, and the fourth is V. But in the feedback for COPSE, the third letter was P (which was marked as x), so P is not in the word. So that's okay. But is COEVE a valid word? I'm not sure. Maybe it's a variant or a less common word. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""COVEE""? But that's not a standard word. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""COTSE""? Not sure. Alternatively, think of ""COTSE"" as a possible word. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""COEVE"". If that's the case, then the letters would be C, O, E, V, E. But the feedback for COPSE said that O is present but not in position 2. In COEVE, O is in position 2, which would contradict the feedback. So that's not possible. Therefore, O must be in position 3 or 4.

So, let's think of a word where O is in position 3 or 4. Let's try ""COEVE"" again. Wait, O is in position 2. That's not allowed. So maybe ""COEVE"" is not the right one. How about ""COEVE"" is not possible. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the secret word is ""COTLE"", but that has O in position 2. Which is not allowed. So that's out. Alternatively, maybe ""COEVE"" is not correct. 

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""COTSE"". Let me check if that's a word. ""Cotse"" is a place name, but not a standard English word. Alternatively, ""COTSE"" might not be valid. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""COEVE"" but with O in position 3. Wait, that would be C _ O _ E. For example, ""COOEE""? Not a word. Or ""COOED""? That's C O O E D. Ends with D. Not E. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""COEVE"" but with O in position 3. So the word would be C _ O _ E. For example, ""CLOVE"". Wait, CLOVE is C L O V E. That's 5 letters. Let's check: C (correct), L (unknown), O (position 3), V (position 4), E (correct). But in the feedback for COPSE, the third letter was P (marked as x), so P is not in the word. But in CLOVE, the third letter is O, which is allowed. Also, the fourth letter is V, which is not in the word (from COPSE feedback, S is not in the word, but V is not mentioned). Wait, the feedback for COPSE was S(x), meaning S is not in the word. So V is allowed. So CLOVE would be a possible word. Let's check: CLOVE is a valid 5-letter word. So that's C L O V E. Let's check the feedback. 

If the secret word is CLOVE, then for the second guess COPSE, the feedback would be: C(✓) O(-) P(x) S(x) E(✓). Because O is in the word (position 3), but in the second guess, O was in position 2, so it's a wrong position. P is not in the word (correct), S is not in the word (correct). So that fits. Then, the third guess would be CLOVE. But wait, the user hasn't provided feedback for the third guess yet. So if I guess CLOVE, and if that's the secret word, then the feedback would be all ✓ for C and E, and the other letters would be correct. But since I don't have feedback yet, I need to make a guess. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CLOVE"". Let me think. So the third guess would be CLOVE. Let's try that. If that's the case, then the feedback would be C(✓), L(-), O(✓), V(-), E(✓). But I need to check if that's possible. Wait, the feedback for the second guess was O(-), meaning O is in the word but not in position 2. In CLOVE, O is in position 3, so that's correct. So that would fit. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CLOVE"". So my next guess would be CLOVE. Let's go with that.",Guess 3: CLOVE -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(✓) O(✓) V(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
