Okay, let's see. I need to guess a 5-letter word. The user hasn't given any feedback yet, so I have to pick a word that's common and maybe has some letters that are likely to be in the secret word. Let me think of some common 5-letter words. Maybe ""CRANE""? Or ""BRAVE""? Wait, ""BRAVE"" might be a good first guess because it has letters that are common in many words. Alternatively, ""STARS"" or ""PLANT""? Hmm. Wait, the example used ""BRISK"" as the secret word. But since I don't know the secret word, I need to pick a word that's likely to have some letters in common.

Alternatively, maybe ""CRANE"" is a good first guess. Let me check. Or maybe ""TEACH""? Or ""TRUCK""? Wait, but I should pick a word that's common enough. Let me think of words that have a mix of vowels and consonants. Maybe ""AUDIO""? Or ""WATER""? Wait, but I don't know. Let me just pick ""BRAVE"" as the first guess. It's a common word with letters B, R, A, V, E. If the secret word has some of these letters, that might help. Alternatively, maybe ""CRANE"" is better. But I need to make sure it's a valid 5-letter word. Let me confirm. Yes, ""BRAVE"" is a valid 5-letter word. So I'll go with that as the first guess.

Okay, let's see. The first guess was BRAVE, and the feedback was B(x), R(x), A(x), V(x), E(-). So that means none of the letters B, R, A, V are in the secret word, but E is present but in the wrong position. Wait, no—the feedback says E(-), which means E is in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word has an E, but not in the first position. So E is somewhere else in the word.

So the secret word has E, but not in position 1. Let me think of other 5-letter words that include E. Also, since B, R, A, V are not in the word, I can eliminate those letters. So the secret word can't have B, R, A, V. So possible letters are other letters. Let me think of words that have E and don't include those letters.

Possible letters: Let's think of words with E. Maybe ""TEACH""? But that has A, which is excluded. Wait, no, the feedback says A(x), so A is not in the word. So TEACH is out. How about ""TEPEE""? But that has two Es. Wait, but the secret word is 5 letters. Let me think. Maybe ""LEMON""? L, E, M, O, N. That has E. But let me check if any of the letters in LEMON are in the first guess. The first guess was BRAVE, so L, E, M, O, N. None of those letters are in BRAVE except E. But E is in the secret word, but in the wrong position. So LEMON could be a possibility. Wait, but the secret word's E is in the wrong position. So if the secret word is LEMON, then E is in position 2. But in the first guess, E was in position 5. So the feedback would be E(-), which matches. So that's possible.

Alternatively, ""MELEE"" but that has two Es. But maybe ""MELEE"" is a word. But the secret word is 5 letters. Let me think of other words. Maybe ""MELON""? That has E in position 2. So if the secret word is MELON, then the first guess BRAVE would have E in position 5, which is wrong, so E(-). That fits. So MELON is a possibility.

Alternatively, ""HEART"" but that has A, which is excluded. So no. ""HEXED""? That has E. But H, X, E, D. Wait, but the secret word can't have A, R, V, B. So maybe ""HEXED"" is possible. But let me check. The secret word is 5 letters. Let me think of other words. Maybe ""STEEP""? But that has E and S, T, E, E, P. But the secret word can't have A, R, V, B. So that's possible. Wait, but the first guess was BRAVE, and the feedback says E is present but in the wrong position. So if the secret word is STEEP, then E is in position 2 and 4. But in the first guess, E is in position 5. So the feedback for E would be -, which matches. So that's possible.

Alternatively, ""STEEP"" is a valid word. But maybe ""STEEP"" is a good guess. Wait, but I need to pick a word that has E and doesn't include B, R, A, V. Let me think of other words. ""LEMON"", ""MELON"", ""STEEP"", ""HEXED"", ""TEPEE"", ""TEEME"" (but that's not a word). ""TEEM"" is 4 letters. Hmm.

Alternatively, ""MELEE"" is a word. So maybe ""MELEE"" is a possible guess. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, MELEE is a word. So the second guess could be MELEE. But maybe I should pick a word that's more likely. Alternatively, ""MELON"" is a common word. Let me go with MELON as the second guess. So the second guess is MELON. Let's see. If the secret word is MELON, then the feedback would be M(-), E(✓), L(✓), O(✓), N(✓). Wait, but the secret word is MELON. Let me check. The first guess was BRAVE. The secret word is MELON. So letters in BRAVE are B, R, A, V, E. The secret word has E, but in position 2. So in the first guess, E is in position 5. So the feedback for E is -, which matches. The other letters B, R, A, V are not in the secret word, so they are x. So the feedback for the first guess would be B(x), R(x), A(x), V(x), E(-). That's correct.

Now, for the second guess, MELON. The letters are M, E, L, O, N. The secret word is MELON. So in the second guess, M is in position 1. If the secret word has M in position 1, then that would be a ✓. But the secret word is MELON, so M is in position 1. So the feedback for M would be ✓. E is in position 2, which is correct. So E would be ✓. L is in position 3, which is correct. O is in position 4, correct. N is in position 5, correct. So the feedback would be all ✓. But that's if the secret word is MELON. However, if the secret word is different, like STEEP, then the feedback would be different.

But since I don't know the secret word, I need to pick a word that has E and other letters that are not in the first guess. So maybe ""MELON"" is a good choice. Alternatively, ""STEEP"". Let me think. ""STEEP"" has E in position 2 and 4. So if the secret word is STEEP, then the second guess would have S, T, E, E, P. The letters in the secret word are S, T, E, E, P. So in the second guess, S is in position 1. If the secret word has S in position 1, then it's ✓. T is in position 2. If the secret word has T in position 2, then it's ✓. E is in position 3, which is correct. But in the first guess, E was in position 5. So the feedback for E would be -, which matches. So the second guess would have S, T, E, E, P. The secret word is STEEP. Then the feedback would be S(✓), T(✓), E(✓), E(✓), P(✓). But that's if the secret word is STEEP. However, the secret word could be something else.

Alternatively, maybe ""LEMON"" is better. Let me think. So the second guess is MELON. But I need to pick a word that's valid. So I'll go with MELON as the second guess.

So letters in BRAVE are B, R, A, V, E. The secret word has E, but in position 2. So in the first guess, E is in position 5. So the feedback for E is -, which matches. The other letters B, R, A, V are not in the secret word, so they are x. So the feedback for the first guess would be B(x), R(x), A(x), V(x), E(-). That's correct.

Now, for the second guess, MELON. The letters are M, E, L, O, N. The secret word is MELON. So in the second guess, M is in position 1. If the secret word has M in position 1, then that would be a ✓. But the secret word is MELON, so M is in position 1. So the feedback for M would be ✓. E is in position 2, which is correct. So E would be ✓. L is in position 3, which is correct. O is in position 4, correct. N is in position 5, correct. So the feedback would be all ✓. But that's if the secret word is MELON. However, if the secret word is different, like STEEP, then the feedback would be different.

But since I don't know the secret word, I need to pick a word that has E and other letters that are not in the first guess. So maybe ""MELON"" is a good choice. Alternatively, ""STEEP"". Let me think. ""STEEP"" has E in position 2 and 4. So if the secret word is STEEP, then the second guess would have S, T, E, E, P. The letters in the secret word are S, T, E, E, P. So in the second guess, S is in position 1. If the secret word has S in position 1, then it's ✓. T is in position 2. If the secret word has T in position 2, then it's ✓. E is in position 3, which is correct. But in the first guess, E was in position 5. So the feedback for E would be -, which matches. So the second guess would have S, T, E, E, P. The secret word is STEEP. Then the feedback would be S(✓), T(✓), E(✓), E(✓), P(✓). But that's if the secret word is STEEP. However, the secret word could be something else.

Alternatively, maybe ""LEMON"" is better. Let me think. So the second guess is MELON. But I need to pick a word that's valid. So I'll go with MELON as the second guess.

Okay, let's see. The user has given feedback for the first two guesses. Let me process that.

First guess was BRAVE, and the feedback was B(x), R(x), A(x), V(x), E(-). So none of B, R, A, V are in the secret word. But E is present but in the wrong position. So E is in the word, but not in position 5 (since in BRAVE, E was in position 5 and got a -).

Second guess was MELON, and the feedback was M(x), E(-), L(x), O(x), N(✓). So M is not in the word. E is in the word but in the wrong position (since in MELON, E is in position 2, and the feedback is -, meaning it's in the word but not in position 2). L is not in the word. O is not in the word. N is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, since in MELON, N is in position 5 and got a ✓). So N is definitely in the secret word and in position 5.

So from the second guess, we know that N is in position 5. Also, E is in the word but not in position 2. Also, since E was in the first guess (position 5) and got a -, and in the second guess (position 2) got a -, so E must be in another position. But since the secret word is 5 letters, and N is in position 5, E can't be in position 5. So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Also, from the first guess, B, R, A, V are excluded. From the second guess, M, L, O are excluded. So the secret word can't have B, R, A, V, M, L, O. So the possible letters are C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Y, Z. But since E and N are in the word, and N is in position 5.

So the secret word has E and N, with N in position 5. So the word is _ _ _ _ N, with E in one of positions 1, 3, or 4.

Also, from the second guess, the E in position 2 was wrong, so E is not in position 2. So E must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Now, let's think of possible words. The secret word is 5 letters, ends with N, has E in positions 1, 3, or 4, and doesn't include B, R, A, V, M, L, O.

Possible letters for the other positions: Let's think of words that end with N and have E in the first, third, or fourth position.

For example:

- E _ _ _ N: Like ""EATER"" but A is excluded. So no. ""EELER"" but that has two Es and R is excluded. ""EENIE"" but that's not a word. ""ELEEN"" (a name, but maybe not acceptable). ""ENNEA"" (no, not a word). ""ENNUI"" (but ends with I). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe E in position 3: _ _ E _ N. Let's think. Words like ""SHEEN"" (but S, H, E, E, N. But E is in position 3. However, S is allowed. Let's check if S is allowed. The secret word can't have B, R, A, V, M, L, O. So S is allowed. So SHEEN is a possible word. But does that fit? Let's check the feedback.

But wait, the second guess was MELON, which had E in position 2. The feedback for E was -, so E is in the word but not in position 2. So if the secret word is SHEEN, then E is in position 3. That would be correct. But let's check if SHEEN is a valid word. Yes, SHEEN is a word meaning a sheen or a shine.

Alternatively, maybe ""SEEN"" but that's 4 letters. ""SEEN"" plus N? No. ""SENNY""? Not a word. ""SHEEN"" seems possible.

Another possibility: E in position 4. So _ _ _ E N. Words like ""BEEEN"" (no, B is excluded). ""DEEEN"" (no). ""PEEN"" is 4 letters. ""PEEN"" plus something? ""PEEN"" is a word, but adding a letter. Maybe ""PEEN"" is part of a longer word. Wait, ""PEEN"" is a noun, but maybe ""PEEN"" plus something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, ""TENET"" but that ends with T. Not N. ""TENON"" is a word. TENON is a 5-letter word meaning a joint. Let's check: T, E, N, O, N. But O is excluded (from the second guess feedback, O was x, so O is not in the word). So TENON has O, which is excluded. So that's invalid.

Another possibility: ""SEEN"" plus N? Not possible. ""SEEN"" is 4 letters. How about ""SENNY""? Not a word. ""SHEEN"" seems better.

Alternatively, ""TENET"" is not ending with N. ""TENON"" is invalid. ""TENNY"" (a name, but maybe not acceptable). ""TENNY"" is a surname, but not sure if it's allowed.

Alternatively, ""EENIE"" is a word (a term from ""Eenie Meenie Miney Moe""), but that's 5 letters. E, E, N, I, E. But that has two Es and an I. But the secret word has E and N. Let's check if that's possible. But the secret word would be EENIE. However, the feedback for the second guess MELON had E in position 2 as -, which would be correct if E is in position 1, 3, or 4. In EENIE, E is in positions 1, 2, 3, 5. But in the second guess, E was in position 2, which was -, so that's okay. But EENIE has E in position 2, which would be a problem. Wait, no. The secret word is EENIE. In the second guess, MELON, the E is in position 2. The feedback for E is -, meaning E is in the word but not in position 2. So if the secret word is EENIE, then E is in position 2, which would conflict. Therefore, EENIE is invalid because the feedback for E in position 2 would be a ✓, but the feedback was -, so E can't be in position 2. Therefore, EENIE is out.

So back to SHEEN. If the secret word is SHEEN, then the letters are S, H, E, E, N. Let's check the feedback. The first guess was BRAVE, which has no S, H, E (but E is in the word, but in position 5 of BRAVE, which was -, so that's correct. Then the second guess was MELON, which has M, E, L, O, N. The secret word has E in position 3, so in MELON, E is in position 2, which is wrong, so feedback is -, which matches. N is in position 5, which is correct. So that would fit.

So SHEEN is a possible word. But is there another possibility? Let's think. Another word could be ""SEEN"" plus a letter. But that's not possible. Alternatively, ""SHEEN"" is a good candidate.

Alternatively, ""SHEEN"" is the word. So the third guess could be SHEEN. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, SHEEN is a valid 5-letter word. So the third guess is SHEEN.

But let me make sure that the letters in SHEEN don't include any of the excluded letters. The excluded letters are B, R, A, V, M, L, O. SHEEN has S, H, E, E, N. None of those letters are excluded. So that's okay.

Alternatively, maybe another word. Let's think of other words. ""SEEN"" is 4 letters. ""SEEN"" plus N? No. ""SENNY"" is not a word. ""SHEEN"" seems the best option.

So the third guess is SHEEN. Let's proceed with that.
