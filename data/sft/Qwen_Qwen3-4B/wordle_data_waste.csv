### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Okay, let's see. I need to guess a 5-letter word, and I have 6 tries. The feedback after each guess will tell me which letters are correct, wrong position, or not in the word at all. So, my first guess should be a word that's common and might have some letters that could be in the secret word. Maybe something like ""CRANE"" because it's a common word and has a mix of letters that could be useful. Let me think... Alternatively, ""BRAIN"" is also a common word. Wait, but maybe I should pick a word that has vowels and consonants that are common. Let me go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess. If that's not right, the feedback will help me narrow down the letters. Let me check if ""CRANE"" is a valid 5-letter English word. Yes, it is. So I'll go with that.

Okay, let's see. The first guess was CRANE, and the feedback was C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(✓). So that means the letters C, R, and N are not in the word. The letter A is present but in the wrong position, and E is correct and in the right position. Wait, E is in the fifth position of the guess CRANE, so the secret word has E in the fifth position. So the fifth letter is E.

So the secret word is _ _ _ _ E. Now, the letters A is in the word but not in the third position (since in CRANE, A is in the third position, and the feedback was A(-), meaning it's in the word but wrong position). So A must be in one of the first four positions but not third.

Also, the letters C, R, N are excluded. So the secret word can't have those letters. So possible letters for the first four positions are other letters. Let's think of possible words that end with E and have A in one of the first four positions, not third.

Possible words: Maybe ""STARE""? Let's check. S, T, A, R, E. But wait, the feedback for CRANE had R(x), so R is not in the word. So STARE has R, which is excluded. So that's not possible. How about ""STAGE""? S, T, A, G, E. That ends with E. A is in third position, but the feedback said A is in the word but wrong position. So if the secret word has A in third position, that would be a problem. Wait, in CRANE, A was in third position and got a -, meaning it's in the word but wrong position. So the secret word's A is not in third position. So in STAGE, A is third, which would be wrong. So that's not allowed. So maybe ""STARE"" is out because of R. How about ""BRAKE""? B, R, A, K, E. But R is excluded. So no. ""BRAKE"" has R, which is not allowed. ""BAKER""? B, A, K, E, R. Again R is there. Not allowed. ""BAKER"" has R in fifth position, but the secret word's fifth is E. So no. Hmm.

Wait, the fifth letter is E. So the word is _ _ _ _ E. Let's think of words ending with E. Maybe ""WASTE""? W, A, S, T, E. That's a valid word. Let's check letters. A is in second position here. In the first guess, A was in third position and got a -, so if the secret word has A in second position, that's okay. Also, W, S, T are not excluded. The letters C, R, N are excluded. So WASTE is possible. Let's check if that's a valid word. Yes. So maybe ""WASTE"" is a good guess. Alternatively, ""STAGE"" but R is excluded. ""STAGE"" has R, which is not allowed. So ""WASTE"" is a possibility.

Another option: ""SLATE"". S, L, A, T, E. A is in third position. But in the first guess, A was in third position and got a -, so that would mean A is in the word but not in third position. So if the secret word has A in third position, that would be a problem. So SLATE would have A in third, which is not allowed. So that's out. How about ""STALE""? S, T, A, L, E. A is in third position again. Same problem. So that's not allowed. ""STALE"" would have A in third, which is wrong. So not allowed.

What about ""WASTE""? A is in second position. That's okay. So WASTE is a possibility. Let's go with that. So the next guess is WASTE. Let's see what feedback we get. If that's correct, then we have the word. If not, we can adjust based on the feedback.
