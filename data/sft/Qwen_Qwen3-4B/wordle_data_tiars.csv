Okay, let's see. I need to guess a 5-letter word. The secret word is somewhere in the list of possible 5-letter English words. Since I don't have any feedback yet, my first guess should be a word that's common and might have letters that are likely to be in the secret word. Maybe something like ""CRANE"" because it's a common word and has vowels that might be useful. Alternatively, ""STARS"" or ""BRAVE"" could be good. Wait, but I should pick a word that's versatile. Let me think. ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E. Those letters are common in many words. Alternatively, ""BLADE"" might be another option. Hmm. Maybe ""CRANE"" is better because it's a common word and has a mix of letters. Let me go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess. If the feedback comes back, I can adjust based on the symbols. But since I don't have any feedback yet, I just need to make an educated guess. I think ""CRANE"" is a solid starting point.

Okay, let's see. The first guess was CRANE, and the feedback was C(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x). So that means the letters C and N are not in the word. R is in the word but in the wrong position. A is correct and in the right position. E is not in the word. So the secret word has A in the third position. Since A is correct and in the right spot, that's a key clue. The letters C and N are out. R is present but not in the second position. So maybe R is in another position. Let me think of words that have A in the third position. For example, ""STARK"" has A in the third position. But wait, the feedback for R was -, so R is in the word but not in the second position. So maybe R is in the first, third, fourth, or fifth position. But the third position is already A. So R could be in first, fourth, or fifth. Let me think of possible words. Maybe ""STARK"" (S, T, A, R, K). But then R is in the fourth position. That would fit. Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" has A in the third position. But then R is in the first position. Wait, but the feedback for R was -, so if R is in the first position, that would be a problem because the feedback for R in the first position of CRANE was -, but if the secret word has R in the first position, then the feedback for R would be a ✓ if it's correct. But in the first guess, the R was in the second position, which was wrong. So if the secret word has R in the first position, then the feedback for R would be a ✓ in the first position. But the feedback was R(-), meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position. So R is in the word but not in the second position. So possible positions for R are 1, 3, 4, or 5. But the third position is A, so R can't be there. So R is in 1, 4, or 5. Let me think of words with A in third position and R in another position. Let's try ""STARK"". If that's the secret word, then the feedback for CRANE would be C(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x). That fits. So maybe STARK is the word. But I need to make a guess. Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" has A in third position. Let's try ""TRAIL"". But wait, the secret word might be something else. Alternatively, ""BLAST"" has A in third position. But then R is not in the word. But the feedback said R is in the word. So that's not possible. So the secret word must have R. Let me think of other words. ""STARK"", ""TRAIL"", ""CRATE"" (but that has A in third position? No, CRATE is C-R-A-T-E. Wait, third letter is A. So that's possible. But then R is in second position. But in the first guess, the R was in second position, which was marked as -, so that would mean R is in the word but not in second position.

But if the secret word has R in second position, then the feedback for R in the first guess (which was in second position) would be a ✓, not a -. Therefore, CRATE can't be the word. So the secret word must have R in a different position. So maybe ""STARK"" (S-T-A-R-K). Then R is in fourth position. That would fit. So the feedback for R in the first guess (second position) is -, which is correct because R is in the fourth position. So that's possible. Alternatively, ""TARAN"" (but that's not a word). Or ""TAROT"" (but that has O, not R in the right position). Alternatively, ""STARE"" (S-T-A-R-E). But then E is in the fifth position. But the feedback for E in the first guess was E(x), meaning E is not in the word. So that would conflict. So STARE can't be the word. So maybe ""STARK"" is the word. Let me try that. So the next guess could be ""STARK"". Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" (T-R-A-I-L). But then R is in second position, which would conflict with the feedback. So that's not possible. So the next guess should be a word with A in third position and R in another position. Let's try ""STARK"". So the guess is STARK. If that's correct, then the feedback would be S(✓?), T(-?), A(✓), R(✓?), K(?)... Wait, but the secret word is STARK. Then the first guess was CRANE. So letters C, R, A, N, E. The secret word is S-T-A-R-K. So in the first guess, C is not in the word (x), R is in the word but in the wrong position (second position in guess, but in secret word it's fourth, so that's a -). A is correct and in the right position (third). N is not in the word (x). E is not in the word (x). So that's correct. Then the next guess would be STARK. If that's the secret word, then the feedback would be S(-) T(-) A(✓) R(✓) K(✓). But wait, in the first guess, the R was in the second position, which was wrong. In the second guess, if the word is STARK, then the R is in the fourth position. So the feedback for R would be ✓ in the fourth position.

I need to guess a 5-letter word. The secret word is somewhere in the list of possible 5-letter English words. Since I don\'t have any feedback yet, my first guess should be a word that\'s common and might have letters that are likely to be in the secret word. Maybe something like ""CRANE"" because it\'s a common word and has vowels that might be useful. Alternatively, ""STARS"" or ""BRAVE"" could be good. Wait, but I should pick a word that\'s versatile. Let me think. ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E. Those letters are common in many words. Alternatively, ""BLADE"" might be another option. Hmm. Maybe ""CRANE"" is better because it\'s a common word and has a mix of letters. Let me go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess. If the feedback comes back, I can adjust based on the symbols. But since I don\'t have any feedback yet, I just need to make an educated guess.

The first guess was CRANE, and the feedback was C(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x). So that means the letters C and N are not in the word. R is in the word but in the wrong position. A is correct and in the right position. E is not in the word. So the secret word has A in the third position. Since A is correct and in the right spot, that\'s a key clue. The letters C and N are out. R is present but not in the second position. So maybe R is in another position. Let me think of words that have A in the third position. For example, ""STARK"" has A in the third position. But wait, the feedback for R was -, so R is in the word but not in the second position. So maybe R is in the first, third, fourth, or fifth position. But the third position is already A. So R could be in first, fourth, or fifth. Let me think of possible words. Maybe ""STARK"" (S, T, A, R, K). But then R is in the fourth position. That would fit. Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" has A in the third position. But then R is in the first position. Wait, but the feedback for R was -, so if R is in the first position, that would be a problem because the feedback for R in the first position of CRANE was -, but if the secret word has R in the first position, then the feedback for R would be a ✓ if it\'s correct. But in the first guess, the R was in the second position, which was wrong. So if the secret word has R in the first position, then the feedback for R would be a ✓ in the first position. But the feedback was R(-), meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position. So R is in the word but not in the second position. So possible positions for R are 1, 3, 4, or 5. But the third position is A, so R can\'t be there. So R is in 1, 4, or 5. Let me think of words with A in third position and R in another position. Let\'s try ""STARK"". If that\'s the secret word, then the feedback for CRANE would be C(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x). That fits. So maybe STARK is the word. But I need to make a guess. Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" has A in third position. Let\'s try ""TRAIL"". But wait, the secret word might be something else. Alternatively, ""BLAST"" has A in third position. But then R is not in the word. But the feedback said R is in the word. So that\'s not possible. So the secret word must have R. Let me think of other words. ""STARK"", ""TRAIL"", ""CRATE"" (but that has A in third position? No, CRATE is C-R-A-T-E. Wait, third letter is A. So that\'s possible. But then R is in second position. But in the first guess, the R was in second position, which was marked as -, so that would mean R is in the word but not in second position. So if the secret word is CRATE, then the R is in second position, which would be a problem because the feedback for R in the first guess was -, meaning R is in the word but in the wrong position. But if the secret word has R in second position, then the feedback for R in the first guess (which was in second position) would be a ✓, not a -. Therefore, CRATE can\'t be the word. So the secret word must have R in a different position. So maybe ""STARK"" (S-T-A-R-K). Then R is in fourth position. That would fit. So the feedback for R in the first guess (second position) is -, which is correct because R is in the fourth position. So that\'s possible. Alternatively, ""TARAN"" (but that\'s not a word). Or ""TAROT"" (but that has O, not R in the right position). Alternatively, ""STARE"" (S-T-A-R-E). But then E is in the fifth position. But the feedback for E in the first guess was E(x), meaning E is not in the word. So that would conflict. So STARE can\'t be the word. So maybe ""STARK"" is the word. Let me try that. So the next guess could be ""STARK"". Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" (T-R-A-I-L). But then R is in second position, which would conflict with the feedback. So that\'s not possible. So the next guess should be a word with A in third position and R in another position. Let\'s try ""STARK"". So the guess is STARK. If that\'s correct, then the feedback would be S(✓?), T(-?), A(✓), R(✓?), K(?)... Wait, but the secret word is STARK. Then the first guess was CRANE. So letters C, R, A, N, E. The secret word is S-T-A-R-K. So in the first guess, C is not in the word (x), R is in the word but in the wrong position (second position in guess, but in secret word it\'s fourth, so that\'s a -). A is correct and in the right position (third). N is not in the word (x). E is not in the word (x). So that\'s correct. Then the next guess would be STARK.

Okay, let's see. The previous guesses were CRANE and STARK. The feedback for CRANE was C(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x). So A is correct in the third position, R is in the word but not in the second position, and C, N, E are not in the word. Then, for STARK, the feedback was S(-), T(-), A(✓), R(✓), K(x). So A is still correct in third position, R is correct but in the fourth position (since in the guess STARK, R is in the fourth position, and the feedback says R(✓), meaning it's in the word and correct position. Wait, but in the first guess, R was in the second position and got a -, meaning it's in the word but wrong position. Now in the second guess, R is in the fourth position and got a ✓, so that must be the correct position. So R is in the fourth position. So the secret word has A in third position, R in fourth position. Also, from the first feedback, C, N, E are not in the word. So the letters we know so far are A (position 3), R (position 4). The other letters are positions 1, 2, 5. Let's think about possible letters.

So the secret word is _ _ A R _. We need to figure out the first, second, and fifth letters. Also, the letters that are not in the word are C, N, E. So possible letters for positions 1, 2, 5 could be other letters. Let's check the feedback for the second guess, STARK. The letters S, T, A, R, K. The feedback was S(-), T(-), A(✓), R(✓), K(x). So S and T are in the word but in the wrong positions? Wait, no. The feedback for S is -, meaning S is in the word but in the wrong position. Similarly for T. But wait, the secret word has A in third and R in fourth. So if S is in the word but in the wrong position, that means S is present but not in the first position (since in the guess STARK, S is first). Similarly, T is in the word but not in the second position (since in the guess, T is second). So the secret word has S and T somewhere else. But the secret word is _ _ A R _. So S and T must be in positions 1, 2, or 5. But since the secret word has A in third and R in fourth, let's think.

So possible letters for positions 1, 2, 5: S, T, and maybe others. Also, the fifth letter can't be K because K was marked as x in the second guess. So K is not in the word. So the fifth letter is not K. Let's think of possible words. Let's consider that the secret word is _ _ A R _. Let's think of words that fit. For example, ""STAR"" plus a letter. Wait, but it's five letters. So maybe ""STARS"" but that has S in first and R in fourth, but then the fifth letter is S. But the secret word would be S T A R S. But then the fifth letter is S. However, the second guess was STARK, which had K in fifth position, which was marked as x, so K is not in the word. So S could be in fifth position. But then the secret word would be S T A R S. But let's check if that's possible. However, the feedback for the second guess (STARK) had S(-), meaning S is in the word but in the wrong position. If the secret word is S T A R S, then in the second guess, S is in first position, but in the secret word, S is in first and fifth. So the feedback for S would be -, meaning S is in the word but not in the first position? Wait, no. If the secret word has S in first position, then in the second guess, S is in first position, so it should be a ✓. But the feedback was S(-), which means S is in the word but in the wrong position. Therefore, the secret word cannot have S in first position. Therefore, S must be in another position. So S could be in second or fifth. Similarly for T. Let's think. The secret word has S and T in it. So possible letters for positions 1, 2, 5. Let's think of words that have A in third, R in fourth, and include S and T. For example, ""STARS"" (S T A R S) but that would have S in first and fifth. But the feedback for S in the second guess (STARK) was -, so S is in the word but not in first position. So if the secret word is S T A R S, then S is in first and fifth. But in the second guess, S is in first position, so the feedback for S would be a ✓, not a -, which contradicts. Therefore, S cannot be in first position. Therefore, S must be in second or fifth. Similarly, T is in the word but not in second position (since in the second guess, T was in second position and got a -). Therefore, T must be in first or fifth position. So possible positions:

Position 1: T or S (but S can't be in first because of the feedback)
Wait, if S is in second position, then position 1 could be T. So the word would be T S A R ?. Then the fifth letter would be something else. Alternatively, position 1 is S, but that's not allowed. So maybe position 1 is T, position 2 is S, and fifth is something else. Let's think of words. For example, ""T S A R ?"". Maybe ""T S A R E""? But E is not allowed (from first feedback, E is x). So E can't be in fifth. So maybe ""T S A R D""? But D is a possible letter. But is that a word? ""TSARD""? No, that's not a word. Alternatively, ""T S A R T""? That's ""TSART"", which is not a word. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the fifth letter is another letter. Let's think of other possibilities. What if the secret word is ""STARS""? But that's S T A R S. But as discussed, that would conflict with the feedback for S. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""TARAS""? But that's T A R A S, which has A in second and fourth positions, but the secret word needs A in third. So that's not possible. Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" but that has A in third, R in fourth, but then the fifth letter is L. But then the secret word would be T R A R L? No, that's not correct. Wait, the secret word is _ _ A R _. So the fourth letter is R. So maybe ""TRAIL"" is T R A I L. But that would have I in fourth position, not R. So that's not correct. Alternatively, ""TARAN"" but that's not a word. Hmm. Maybe the fifth letter is something else. Let's think of possible letters. The fifth letter can't be K, E, C, N. So possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But R is already in fourth position. So fifth letter can't be R. So possible letters. Let's think of words that fit _ _ A R _ with S and T in the word. Let's try ""STARS"" again. If the secret word is S T A R S, but then the feedback for S in the second guess (STARK) would be S(-), which means S is in the word but not in first position. But in the secret word, S is in first and fifth. So in the second guess, S is in first position, so the feedback should be S(✓), but it's S(-). Therefore, that's a contradiction. Therefore, S cannot be in first position. Therefore, S must be in fifth position. So the word would be _ _ A R S. Then, the first two letters would be T and something else. But T is in the word. Since in the second guess, T was in second position and got a -, meaning T is in the word but not in second position. So T must be in first or fifth. But fifth is S, so T must be in first. So the word would be T _ A R S. Then the second letter is something else. Let's think of words. For example, ""T R A R S"" but that's not a word. Or ""T A A R S"" but that's not a word. Alternatively, ""T E A R S"" but E is not allowed. Or ""T I A R S"" (Tiar s? Tiar is a word, but Tiar s would be ""TIARS"", which is a word. So ""TIARS"" would be T I A R S. Let's check if that fits. The secret word is TIARS. Then, the letters would be T (position 1), I (position 2), A (position 3), R (position 4), S (position 5). Now, checking the feedback for the second guess, STARK. The letters in STARK are S, T, A, R, K. The feedback was S(-), T(-), A(✓), R(✓), K(x). So in the secret word TIARS, S is present (position 5), so S is in the word but not in first position (where it was in the guess), so that's correct (S(-)). T is present in position 1, but in the guess, T was in position 2, so that's correct (T(-)). A is in third position (✓). R is in fourth position (✓). K is not in the word (x). So that fits. Therefore, the secret word could be TIARS. But is TIARS a valid word? Let me check. Yes, ""tiar"" is a word, and ""tiars"" is the plural, so that's valid. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""TASAR"" but that's not a word. Or ""TARAS"" (a name, but maybe not a common word). Alternatively, ""TARAS"" is a name, but not sure if it's considered a valid English word. However, ""TIARS"" is a valid plural of ""tiar"". So maybe that's the word. But I need to make a guess. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""STARS"" but that conflicts with the feedback. So given the feedback, the next guess should be a word that has T in first position, S in fifth, and A in third, R in fourth. So the word would be T _ A R S. The second letter could be I, as in TIARS. So the next guess is TIARS. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes. So I'll go with TIARS as the third guess.

<guess>TIARS</guess>",TIARS,"Okay, let's see. The previous guesses were CRANE and STARK. The feedback for CRANE was C(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x). So A is correct in the third position, R is in the word but not in the second position, and C, N, E are not in the word. Then, for STARK, the feedback was S(-), T(-), A(✓), R(✓), K(x). So A is still correct in third position, R is correct but in the fourth position (since in the guess STARK, R is in the fourth position, and the feedback says R(✓), meaning it's in the word and correct position. Wait, but in the first guess, R was in the second position and got a -, meaning it's in the word but wrong position. Now in the second guess, R is in the fourth position and got a ✓, so that must be the correct position. So R is in the fourth position. So the secret word has A in third position, R in fourth position. Also, from the first feedback, C, N, E are not in the word. So the letters we know so far are A (position 3), R (position 4). The other letters are positions 1, 2, 5. Let's think about possible letters.

So the secret word is _ _ A R _. We need to figure out the first, second, and fifth letters. Also, the letters that are not in the word are C, N, E. So possible letters for positions 1, 2, 5 could be other letters. Let's check the feedback for the second guess, STARK. The letters S, T, A, R, K. The feedback was S(-), T(-), A(✓), R(✓), K(x). So S and T are in the word but in the wrong positions? Wait, no. The feedback for S is -, meaning S is in the word but in the wrong position. Similarly for T. But wait, the secret word has A in third and R in fourth. So if S is in the word but in the wrong position, that means S is present but not in the first position (since in the guess STARK, S is first). Similarly, T is in the word but not in the second position (since in the guess, T is second). So the secret word has S and T somewhere else. But the secret word is _ _ A R _. So S and T must be in positions 1, 2, or 5. But since the secret word has A in third and R in fourth, let's think.

So possible letters for positions 1, 2, 5: S, T, and maybe others. Also, the fifth letter can't be K because K was marked as x in the second guess. So K is not in the word. So the fifth letter is not K. Let's think of possible words. Let's consider that the secret word is _ _ A R _. Let's think of words that fit. For example, ""STAR"" plus a letter. Wait, but it's five letters. So maybe ""STARS"" but that has S in first and R in fourth, but then the fifth letter is S. But the secret word would be S T A R S. But then the fifth letter is S. However, the second guess was STARK, which had K in fifth position, which was marked as x, so K is not in the word. So S could be in fifth position. But then the secret word would be S T A R S. But let's check if that's possible. However, the feedback for the second guess (STARK) had S(-), meaning S is in the word but in the wrong position. If the secret word is S T A R S, then in the second guess, S is in first position, but in the secret word, S is in first and fifth. So the feedback for S would be -, meaning S is in the word but not in the first position? Wait, no. If the secret word has S in first position, then in the second guess, S is in first position, so it should be a ✓. But the feedback was S(-), which means S is in the word but in the wrong position. Therefore, the secret word cannot have S in first position. Therefore, S must be in another position. So S could be in second or fifth. Similarly for T. Let's think. The secret word has S and T in it. So possible letters for positions 1, 2, 5. Let's think of words that have A in third, R in fourth, and include S and T. For example, ""STARS"" (S T A R S) but that would have S in first and fifth. But the feedback for S in the second guess (STARK) was -, so S is in the word but not in first position. So if the secret word is S T A R S, then S is in first and fifth. But in the second guess, S is in first position, so the feedback for S would be a ✓, not a -, which contradicts. Therefore, S cannot be in first position. Therefore, S must be in second or fifth. Similarly, T is in the word but not in second position (since in the second guess, T was in second position and got a -). Therefore, T must be in first or fifth position. So possible positions:

Position 1: T or S (but S can't be in first because of the feedback)
Wait, if S is in second position, then position 1 could be T. So the word would be T S A R ?. Then the fifth letter would be something else. Alternatively, position 1 is S, but that's not allowed. So maybe position 1 is T, position 2 is S, and fifth is something else. Let's think of words. For example, ""T S A R ?"". Maybe ""T S A R E""? But E is not allowed (from first feedback, E is x). So E can't be in fifth. So maybe ""T S A R D""? But D is a possible letter. But is that a word? ""TSARD""? No, that's not a word. Alternatively, ""T S A R T""? That's ""TSART"", which is not a word. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the fifth letter is another letter. Let's think of other possibilities. What if the secret word is ""STARS""? But that's S T A R S. But as discussed, that would conflict with the feedback for S. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""TARAS""? But that's T A R A S, which has A in second and fourth positions, but the secret word needs A in third. So that's not possible. Alternatively, ""TRAIL"" but that has A in third, R in fourth, but then the fifth letter is L. But then the secret word would be T R A R L? No, that's not correct. Wait, the secret word is _ _ A R _. So the fourth letter is R. So maybe ""TRAIL"" is T R A I L. But that would have I in fourth position, not R. So that's not correct. Alternatively, ""TARAN"" but that's not a word. Hmm. Maybe the fifth letter is something else. Let's think of possible letters. The fifth letter can't be K, E, C, N. So possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But R is already in fourth position. So fifth letter can't be R. So possible letters. Let's think of words that fit _ _ A R _ with S and T in the word. Let's try ""STARS"" again. If the secret word is S T A R S, but then the feedback for S in the second guess (STARK) would be S(-), which means S is in the word but not in first position. But in the secret word, S is in first and fifth. So in the second guess, S is in first position, so the feedback should be S(✓), but it's S(-). Therefore, that's a contradiction. Therefore, S cannot be in first position. Therefore, S must be in fifth position. So the word would be _ _ A R S. Then, the first two letters would be T and something else. But T is in the word. Since in the second guess, T was in second position and got a -, meaning T is in the word but not in second position. So T must be in first or fifth. But fifth is S, so T must be in first. So the word would be T _ A R S. Then the second letter is something else. Let's think of words. For example, ""T R A R S"" but that's not a word. Or ""T A A R S"" but that's not a word. Alternatively, ""T E A R S"" but E is not allowed. Or ""T I A R S"" (Tiar s? Tiar is a word, but Tiar s would be ""TIARS"", which is a word. So ""TIARS"" would be T I A R S. Let's check if that fits. The secret word is TIARS. Then, the letters would be T (position 1), I (position 2), A (position 3), R (position 4), S (position 5). Now, checking the feedback for the second guess, STARK. The letters in STARK are S, T, A, R, K. The feedback was S(-), T(-), A(✓), R(✓), K(x). So in the secret word TIARS, S is present (position 5), so S is in the word but not in first position (where it was in the guess), so that's correct (S(-)). T is present in position 1, but in the guess, T was in position 2, so that's correct (T(-)). A is in third position (✓). R is in fourth position (✓). K is not in the word (x). So that fits. Therefore, the secret word could be TIARS. But is TIARS a valid word? Let me check. Yes, ""tiar"" is a word, and ""tiars"" is the plural, so that's valid. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""TASAR"" but that's not a word. Or ""TARAS"" (a name, but maybe not a common word). Alternatively, ""TARAS"" is a name, but not sure if it's considered a valid English word. However, ""TIARS"" is a valid plural of ""tiar"". So maybe that's the word. But I need to make a guess. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""STARS"" but that conflicts with the feedback. So given the feedback, the next guess should be a word that has T in first position, S in fifth, and A in third, R in fourth. So the word would be T _ A R S. The second letter could be I, as in TIARS. So the next guess is TIARS. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes. So I'll go with TIARS as the third guess.",Guess 3: TIARS -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) I(✓) A(✓) R(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
