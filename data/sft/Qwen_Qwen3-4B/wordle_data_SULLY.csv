Okay, let's see. I need to guess a 5-letter word. The secret word is somewhere in the list of possible 5-letter English words. Since I don't have any feedback yet, my first guess should be a common or versatile word that might have letters that could be part of many words. Maybe something like ""crane"" because it's a common word and has a mix of letters. Alternatively, ""apple"" is another common word. Wait, but maybe ""crane"" has letters that are more likely to be in other words. Let me think. Or maybe ""stone"" since it's a common word with multiple letters. Hmm. Alternatively, ""water"" is also a common word. But I need to pick one. Let me go with ""crane"" as my first guess. If that's not right, the feedback will help me adjust. But since I don't have any feedback yet, I just need to pick a word that's common and has a good chance of overlapping with the secret word. So, I'll go with ""crane"".

Okay, so my first guess was ""CRANE"" and all the letters were marked with x, meaning none of the letters are in the secret word. That's interesting. So the secret word doesn't have C, R, A, N, or E. So I need to think of a 5-letter word that doesn't include any of those letters.

Let me think. The letters that are excluded are C, R, A, N, E. So the secret word can't have any of those. So possible letters could be B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But since it's a 5-letter word, I need to pick letters from these.

Let me think of some 5-letter words that don't include those letters. Maybe ""BRAVE"" but that has A and E, which are excluded. Wait, no, the feedback said all letters in CRANE are x, so the secret word doesn't have any of those letters. So ""BRAVE"" is out because it has A and E. Hmm.

What about ""BOWLS""? Let's check: B, O, W, L, S. None of those letters are in CRANE. So that's possible. Or ""BOWEL"" but that has E, which is excluded. No. ""BOWLS"" seems okay. Alternatively, ""BLAST"" has letters B, L, A, S, T. Wait, A is excluded. So that's out. ""BLAST"" has A, which is not allowed. So no.

How about ""BLOOM""? B, L, O, O, M. No A or E. That's possible. But maybe ""BLOOM"" is a good guess. Alternatively, ""BLAZE"" has A, which is excluded. No. ""BLOOM"" is okay. Or ""BLUSH"" has U, but that's allowed. Wait, ""BLUSH"" is B, L, U, S, H. None of those letters are in CRANE. So that's possible.

Alternatively, ""BUTTS"" is B, U, T, T, S. That's allowed. But maybe ""BUTTS"" is a bit common. Alternatively, ""BUTTS"" is a valid word. But maybe ""BUTTS"" is more of a slang term. Hmm.

Alternatively, ""BOWEL"" is out because of E. ""BOWLS"" is a good candidate. Let me think. Another option is ""BOWLS"". Let me check again. B, O, W, L, S. None of those letters are in CRANE. So that's possible. So maybe ""BOWLS"" is a good guess. Alternatively, ""BUTTS"" or ""BLUSH"". But since I need to pick one, maybe ""BOWLS"" is a good choice. Let me go with that.

Wait, but maybe ""BUTTS"" is better. Let me think again. The secret word is 5 letters, no C, R, A, N, E. So possible letters are B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But maybe I should pick a word that's more common. ""BUTTS"" is a bit more common than ""BLUSH"" or ""BLOOM"". But maybe ""BUTTS"" is not the best. Alternatively, ""BOWLS"" is a common word.

So, that means the letter L is in the secret word and in the correct position (since it's a ✓), and S is present but in the wrong position (so S is in the word but not in the 5th position). The letters B, O, W are not in the secret word.

So, the secret word has L in the 4th position (since the feedback for BOWLS shows L(✓), which is the 4th letter in BOWLS). Also, S is present but not in the 5th position. So S must be in one of the other positions. Also, the secret word can't have any of the letters from CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) or B, O, W (from the second guess's feedback). Wait, no. Wait, the feedback for BOWLS shows that B, O, W are x, meaning they are not in the secret word. So the secret word can't have B, O, W. But the secret word can have letters that are not in CRANE (so not C, R, A, N, E) and also not B, O, W. Wait, but the first feedback said that CRANE's letters are all x, so the secret word doesn't have C, R, A, N, E. Then, the second guess's feedback says that B, O, W are x, so the secret word doesn't have those either. So the letters allowed are those not in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) and not in BOWLS (B, O, W). So the allowed letters are: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z. Wait, but the secret word has L (from the second guess's feedback), and S (since S is in the word but in the wrong position). So the secret word must include L and S. Also, the letters in the secret word can't be C, R, A, N, E, B, O, W. So possible letters are D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z. 

Now, the secret word is 5 letters. We know that the 4th letter is L. Also, S is present but not in the 5th position. So S must be in one of the first four positions. Also, the secret word can't have any of the letters C, R, A, N, E, B, O, W. So possible letters for the other positions are D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z. 

So the secret word has L in the 4th position. Let's think of possible words. Let's consider that the 4th letter is L. Let's think of words where the 4th letter is L. For example, ""STALK"" (S-T-A-L-K), but A is excluded. ""STALK"" has A, which is not allowed. ""STOLE"" has O, which is excluded. ""STILL"" has I, L, L. But the secret word has L in the 4th position. Wait, ""STILL"" is S-T-I-L-L. But the secret word has 5 letters. Let me think. Another possibility is ""SILKY"" (S-I-L-K-Y), but that has K and Y. But that's allowed. Wait, but the secret word has S in it, but not in the 5th position. So S could be in position 1, 2, or 3. Let's think of possible words.

Alternatively, ""SILLY"" (S-I-L-L-Y). That has two Ls. But the secret word has L in the 4th position. So that's possible. But the letters would be S, I, L, L, Y. But the secret word can't have any of the letters from CRANE or BOWLS. So S is allowed, I is allowed, L is allowed, Y is allowed. So that's possible. But the feedback for the second guess (BOWLS) shows that S is in the word but not in the 5th position. So S could be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Another possibility is ""SLIME"" (S-L-I-M-E), but E is excluded. So that's out. ""SLIME"" has E, which is not allowed. ""SLASH"" has A, which is excluded. ""SLATE"" has A, which is excluded. ""SLASH"" is out. ""SLICE"" has I, C, but C is excluded. So that's out. ""SLIME"" is out. ""SLOTH"" has O, which is excluded. ""SLASH"" is out. ""SLIME"" is out. ""SILKY"" is possible. Let's check: S, I, L, K, Y. All letters are allowed. The 4th letter is L, which matches the feedback. S is in the first position, so that's okay. So ""SILKY"" could be a candidate. But is that a valid word? Yes, SILKY is a 5-letter word.

Alternatively, ""SLIME"" is out because of E. ""SILKY"" is a good candidate. But maybe there's another word. Let's think of ""SILLY"" (S-I-L-L-Y). That's also possible. The 4th letter is L, and S is in the first position. So that's allowed. But the secret word could be ""SILLY"". However, the feedback for the second guess (BOWLS) says that S is in the word but not in the 5th position. So in ""SILLY"", S is in the first position, which is correct. So that's possible.

Another possibility is ""SILKS"" (S-I-L-K-S). But that has two S's. However, the secret word would have S in position 1 and 5. But the feedback for BOWLS says that S is in the word but not in the 5th position. So if the secret word is ""SILKS"", then S is in position 5, which would contradict the feedback. Therefore, that's not possible. So S must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Another option is ""SILLY"" (S-I-L-L-Y). That's valid. Or ""SILKY"" (S-I-L-K-Y). Both have L in the 4th position. Let's check if there's another possibility. What about ""SILLY""? That's a valid word. Let's see. The letters would be S, I, L, L, Y. All allowed. The 4th letter is L, which matches the feedback. S is in the first position, which is allowed. So that's possible.

Alternatively, ""SILLY"" is a good candidate. But maybe there's another word. Let's think of ""SLIME"" again. No, E is excluded. ""SLASH"" is out. ""SLIME"" is out. ""SILKY"" is another option. So between ""SILLY"" and ""SILKY"", which is more likely? Well, the feedback for the second guess (BOWLS) says that S is in the word but not in the 5th position. So S could be in position 1, 2, or 3. Let's think of another word. Maybe ""SLUSH"" (S-L-U-S-H). But that has two S's. However, the secret word has S in the word, but not in the 5th position. So if the secret word is ""SLUSH"", then S is in position 1 and 4. But the 4th letter is L (from the feedback), so that's conflicting. So ""SLUSH"" can't be right. Because the 4th letter is L, so the 4th letter in the secret word is L. So ""SLUSH"" would have S in position 1 and 4, but the 4th letter is L, so that's not possible. Therefore, ""SLUSH"" is out.

Another possibility: ""SILLY"". Let's check again. The letters are S, I, L, L, Y. The 4th letter is L (correct), and S is in the first position. That's allowed. So that's a possible candidate. Alternatively, ""SILKY"" is S, I, L, K, Y. The 4th letter is L (correct), and S is in the first position. That's also allowed. So either could be possible.

But how do I choose between them? Well, maybe I can think of other words. Let's see. What about ""SILKY""? That's a valid word. Or ""SILLY"". Both are valid. Alternatively, ""SILKS"" is out because of the 5th position. ""SILLY"" is more likely. But I need to make a guess. Let's go with ""SILLY"" as the third guess. Wait, but the secret word could be ""SILLY"" or ""SILKY"". Alternatively, maybe ""SILLY"" is more likely. But I need to make a guess. Let's pick ""SILLY"". But wait, the feedback for the second guess (BOWLS) says that S is in the word but not in the 5th position. So if the secret word is ""SILLY"", then S is in position 1, which is correct. So that's allowed. So I'll guess ""SILLY"".

But wait, the secret word is 5 letters. Let me check again. ""SILLY"" is 5 letters. Yes. So that's a valid guess. Alternatively, maybe ""SILKY"" is better. But I need to choose one. Let's go with ""SILLY"" as the third guess. But wait, the feedback for the second guess (BOWLS) says that S is in the word but not in the 5th position. So if the secret word is ""SILLY"", then S is in position 1, which is allowed. So that's correct. So I think ""SILLY"" is a good guess. But maybe I should check for other possibilities. Another word could be ""SILKY"". Let's think. If the secret word is ""SILKY"", then the letters are S, I, L, K, Y. The 4th letter is L (correct), and S is in the first position. That's allowed. So that's also possible.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""SILLY"". But I need to pick one. Let's go with ""SILLY"". But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe ""SILKY"" is better. Let me think again. The secret word has L in the 4th position. So the 4th letter is L. The other letters are S, and others. So maybe ""SILLY"" is more likely. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""SILLY"". Let me proceed with that.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

Okay, let's see. I need to guess a 5-letter word. The secret word is somewhere in the list of possible 5-letter English words. Since I don't have any feedback yet, my first guess should be a common or versatile word that might have letters that could be part of many words. Maybe something like ""crane"" because it's a common word and has a mix of letters. Alternatively, ""apple"" is another common word. Wait, but maybe ""crane"" has letters that are more likely to be in other words. Let me think. Or maybe ""stone"" since it's a common word with multiple letters. Hmm. Alternatively, ""water"" is also a common word. But I need to pick one. Let me go with ""crane"" as my first guess. If that's not right, the feedback will help me adjust. But since I don't have any feedback yet, I just need to pick a word that's common and has a good chance of overlapping with the secret word. So, I'll go with ""crane"".

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Okay, so my first guess was ""CRANE"" and all the letters were marked with x, meaning none of the letters are in the secret word. That's interesting. So the secret word doesn't have C, R, A, N, or E. So I need to think of a 5-letter word that doesn't include any of those letters.

Let me think. The letters that are excluded are C, R, A, N, E. So the secret word can't have any of those. So possible letters could be B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But since it's a 5-letter word, I need to pick letters from these.

Let me think of some 5-letter words that don't include those letters. Maybe ""BRAVE"" but that has A and E, which are excluded. Wait, no, the feedback said all letters in CRANE are x, so the secret word doesn't have any of those letters. So ""BRAVE"" is out because it has A and E. Hmm.

What about ""BOWLS""? Let's check: B, O, W, L, S. None of those letters are in CRANE. So that's possible. Or ""BOWEL"" but that has E, which is excluded. No. ""BOWLS"" seems okay. Alternatively, ""BLAST"" has letters B, L, A, S, T. Wait, A is excluded. So that's out. ""BLAST"" has A, which is not allowed. So no.

How about ""BLOOM""? B, L, O, O, M. No A or E. That's possible. But maybe ""BLOOM"" is a good guess. Alternatively, ""BLAZE"" has A, which is excluded. No. ""BLOOM"" is okay. Or ""BLUSH"" has U, but that's allowed. Wait, ""BLUSH"" is B, L, U, S, H. None of those letters are in CRANE. So that's possible.

Alternatively, ""BUTTS"" is B, U, T, T, S. That's allowed. But maybe ""BUTTS"" is a bit common. Alternatively, ""BUTTS"" is a valid word. But maybe ""BUTTS"" is more of a slang term. Hmm.

Alternatively, ""BOWEL"" is out because of E. ""BOWLS"" is a good candidate. Let me think. Another option is ""BOWLS"". Let me check again. B, O, W, L, S. None of those letters are in CRANE. So that's possible. So maybe ""BOWLS"" is a good guess. Alternatively, ""BUTTS"" or ""BLUSH"". But since I need to pick one, maybe ""BOWLS"" is a good choice. Let me go with that.

Wait, but maybe ""BUTTS"" is better. Let me think again. The secret word is 5 letters, no C, R, A, N, E. So possible letters are B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. So ""BUTTS"" is B, U, T, T, S. All allowed. ""BUTTS"" is a valid word. Alternatively, ""BLAST"" is out because of A. ""BLUSH"" is B, L, U, S, H. All allowed. So ""BLUSH"" is another option. Maybe ""BLUSH"" is better. Let me check. BLUSH is a valid word. So perhaps that's a better guess. Alternatively, ""BLOOM"" is B, L, O, O, M. Also allowed.

But maybe I should pick a word that's more common. ""BUTTS"" is a bit more common than ""BLUSH"" or ""BLOOM"". But maybe ""BUTTS"" is not the best. Alternatively, ""BOWLS"" is a common word. So I think I'll go with ""BOWLS"" as my second guess. Let me check again. B, O, W, L, S. None of those letters are in CRANE. So that's safe. So I'll guess ""BOWLS"".

Okay, let's see. The user has given me two guesses so far. The first guess was CRANE, which had all letters marked as x, meaning none of those letters are in the secret word. Then, the second guess was BOWLS, and the feedback was B(x), O(x), W(x), L(✓), S(-). So, that means the letter L is in the secret word and in the correct position (since it's a ✓), and S is present but in the wrong position (so S is in the word but not in the 5th position). The letters B, O, W are not in the secret word.

So, the secret word has L in the 4th position (since the feedback for BOWLS shows L(✓), which is the 4th letter in BOWLS). Also, S is present but not in the 5th position. So S must be in one of the other positions. Also, the secret word can't have any of the letters from CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) or B, O, W (from the second guess's feedback). Wait, no. Wait, the feedback for BOWLS shows that B, O, W are x, meaning they are not in the secret word. So the secret word can't have B, O, W. But the secret word can have letters that are not in CRANE (so not C, R, A, N, E) and also not B, O, W. Wait, but the first feedback said that CRANE's letters are all x, so the secret word doesn't have C, R, A, N, E. Then, the second guess's feedback says that B, O, W are x, so the secret word doesn't have those either. So the letters allowed are those not in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) and not in BOWLS (B, O, W). So the allowed letters are: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z. Wait, but the secret word has L (from the second guess's feedback), and S (since S is in the word but in the wrong position). So the secret word must include L and S. Also, the letters in the secret word can't be C, R, A, N, E, B, O, W. So possible letters are D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z. 

Now, the secret word is 5 letters. We know that the 4th letter is L. Also, S is present but not in the 5th position. So S must be in one of the first four positions. Also, the secret word can't have any of the letters C, R, A, N, E, B, O, W. So possible letters for the other positions are D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z. 

So the secret word has L in the 4th position. Let's think of possible words. Let's consider that the 4th letter is L. Let's think of words where the 4th letter is L. For example, ""STALK"" (S-T-A-L-K), but A is excluded. ""STALK"" has A, which is not allowed. ""STOLE"" has O, which is excluded. ""STILL"" has I, L, L. But the secret word has L in the 4th position. Wait, ""STILL"" is S-T-I-L-L. But the secret word has 5 letters. Let me think. Another possibility is ""SILKY"" (S-I-L-K-Y), but that has K and Y. But that's allowed. Wait, but the secret word has S in it, but not in the 5th position. So S could be in position 1, 2, or 3. Let's think of possible words.

Alternatively, ""SILLY"" (S-I-L-L-Y). That has two Ls. But the secret word has L in the 4th position. So that's possible. But the letters would be S, I, L, L, Y. But the secret word can't have any of the letters from CRANE or BOWLS. So S is allowed, I is allowed, L is allowed, Y is allowed. So that's possible. But the feedback for the second guess (BOWLS) shows that S is in the word but not in the 5th position. So S could be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Another possibility is ""SLIME"" (S-L-I-M-E), but E is excluded. So that's out. ""SLIME"" has E, which is not allowed. ""SLASH"" has A, which is excluded. ""SLATE"" has A, which is excluded. ""SLASH"" is out. ""SLICE"" has I, C, but C is excluded. So that's out. ""SLIME"" is out. ""SLOTH"" has O, which is excluded. ""SLASH"" is out. ""SLIME"" is out. ""SILKY"" is possible. Let's check: S, I, L, K, Y. All letters are allowed. The 4th letter is L, which matches the feedback. S is in the first position, so that's okay. So ""SILKY"" could be a candidate. But is that a valid word? Yes, SILKY is a 5-letter word.

Alternatively, ""SLIME"" is out because of E. ""SILKY"" is a good candidate. But maybe there's another word. Let's think of ""SILLY"" (S-I-L-L-Y). That's also possible. The 4th letter is L, and S is in the first position. So that's allowed. But the secret word could be ""SILLY"". However, the feedback for the second guess (BOWLS) says that S is in the word but not in the 5th position. So in ""SILLY"", S is in the first position, which is correct. So that's possible.

Another possibility is ""SILKS"" (S-I-L-K-S). But that has two S's. However, the secret word would have S in position 1 and 5. But the feedback for BOWLS says that S is in the word but not in the 5th position. So if the secret word is ""SILKS"", then S is in position 5, which would contradict the feedback. Therefore, that's not possible. So S must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Another option is ""SILLY"" (S-I-L-L-Y). That's valid. Or ""SILKY"" (S-I-L-K-Y). Both have L in the 4th position. Let's check if there's another possibility. What about ""SILLY""? That's a valid word. Let's see. The letters would be S, I, L, L, Y. All allowed. The 4th letter is L, which matches the feedback. S is in the first position, which is allowed. So that's possible.

Alternatively, ""SILLY"" is a good candidate. But maybe there's another word. Let's think of ""SLIME"" again. No, E is excluded. ""SLASH"" is out. ""SLIME"" is out. ""SILKY"" is another option. So between ""SILLY"" and ""SILKY"", which is more likely? Well, the feedback for the second guess (BOWLS) says that S is in the word but not in the 5th position. So S could be in position 1, 2, or 3. Let's think of another word. Maybe ""SLUSH"" (S-L-U-S-H). But that has two S's. However, the secret word has S in the word, but not in the 5th position. So if the secret word is ""SLUSH"", then S is in position 1 and 4. But the 4th letter is L (from the feedback), so that's conflicting. So ""SLUSH"" can't be right. Because the 4th letter is L, so the 4th letter in the secret word is L. So ""SLUSH"" would have S in position 1 and 4, but the 4th letter is L, so that's not possible. Therefore, ""SLUSH"" is out.

Another possibility: ""SILLY"". Let's check again. The letters are S, I, L, L, Y. The 4th letter is L (correct), and S is in the first position. That's allowed. So that's a possible candidate. Alternatively, ""SILKY"" is S, I, L, K, Y. The 4th letter is L (correct), and S is in the first position. That's also allowed. So either could be possible.

But how do I choose between them? Well, maybe I can think of other words. Let's see. What about ""SILKY""? That's a valid word. Or ""SILLY"". Both are valid. Alternatively, ""SILKS"" is out because of the 5th position. ""SILLY"" is more likely. But I need to make a guess. Let's go with ""SILLY"" as the third guess. Wait, but the secret word could be ""SILLY"" or ""SILKY"". Alternatively, maybe ""SILLY"" is more likely. But I need to make a guess. Let's pick ""SILLY"". But wait, the feedback for the second guess (BOWLS) says that S is in the word but not in the 5th position. So if the secret word is ""SILLY"", then S is in position 1, which is correct. So that's allowed. So I'll guess ""SILLY"".

But wait, the secret word is 5 letters. Let me check again. ""SILLY"" is 5 letters. Yes. So that's a valid guess. Alternatively, maybe ""SILKY"" is better. But I need to choose one. Let's go with ""SILLY"" as the third guess. But wait, the feedback for the second guess (BOWLS) says that S is in the word but not in the 5th position. So if the secret word is ""SILLY"", then S is in position 1, which is allowed. So that's correct. So I think ""SILLY"" is a good guess. But maybe I should check for other possibilities. Another word could be ""SILKY"". Let's think. If the secret word is ""SILKY"", then the letters are S, I, L, K, Y. The 4th letter is L (correct), and S is in the first position. That's allowed. So that's also possible.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""SILLY"". But I need to pick one. Let's go with ""SILLY"". But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe ""SILKY"" is better. Let me think again. The secret word has L in the 4th position. So the 4th letter is L. The other letters are S, and others. So maybe ""SILLY"" is more likely. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""SILLY"". Let me proceed with that.

The user has given me two guesses so far. The first guess was CRANE, which had all letters marked as x, meaning none of those letters are in the secret word. Then, the second guess was BOWLS, and the feedback was B(x), O(x), W(x), L(✓), S(-). So, that means the letter L is in the secret word and in the correct position (since it\'s a ✓), and S is present but in the wrong position (so S is in the word but not in the 5th position). The letters B, O, W are not in the secret word.\n\nSo, the secret word has L in the 4th position (since the feedback for BOWLS shows L(✓), which is the 4th letter in BOWLS). Also, S is present but not in the 5th position. So S must be in one of the other positions. Also, the secret word can\'t have any of the letters from CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) or B, O, W (from the second guess\'s feedback). Wait, no. Wait, the feedback for BOWLS shows that B, O, W are x, meaning they are not in the secret word. So the secret word can\'t have B, O, W. But the secret word can have letters that are not in CRANE (so not C, R, A, N, E) and also not B, O, W. Wait, but the first feedback said that CRANE\'s letters are all x, so the secret word doesn\'t have C, R, A, N, E. Then, the second guess\'s feedback says that B, O, W are x, so the secret word doesn\'t have those either. So the letters allowed are those not in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) and not in BOWLS (B, O, W). So the allowed letters are: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z. Wait, but the secret word has L (from the second guess\'s feedback), and S (since S is in the word but in the wrong position). So the secret word must include L and S.

We know that the 4th letter is L. Also, S is present but not in the 5th position. So S must be in one of the first four positions.

So possible letters for the other positions are D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z. \n\nSo the secret word has L in the 4th position. Let\'s think of possible words. Let\'s consider that the 4th letter is L. Let\'s think of words where the 4th letter is L. For example, ""STALK"" (S-T-A-L-K), but A is excluded. ""STALK"" has A, which is not allowed. ""STOLE"" has O, which is excluded. ""STILL"" has I, L, L. But the secret word has L in the 4th position. Wait, ""STILL"" is S-T-I-L-L. But the secret word has 5 letters. Let me think. Another possibility is ""SILKY"" (S-I-L-K-Y), but that has K and Y. But that\'s allowed. Wait, but the secret word has S in it, but not in the 5th position. So S could be in position 1, 2, or 3. Let\'s think of possible words.\n\nAlternatively, ""SILLY"" (S-I-L-L-Y). That has two Ls. But the secret word has L in the 4th position. So that\'s possible. But the letters would be S, I, L, L, Y. But the secret word can\'t have any of the letters from CRANE or BOWLS. So S is allowed, I is allowed, L is allowed, Y is allowed. So that\'s possible. But the feedback for the second guess (BOWLS) shows that S is in the word but not in the 5th position. So S could be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nAnother possibility is ""SLIME"" (S-L-I-M-E), but E is excluded. So that\'s out. ""SLIME"" has E, which is not allowed. ""SLASH"" has A, which is excluded. ""SLATE"" has A, which is excluded. ""SLASH"" is out. ""SLICE"" has I, C, but C is excluded. So that\'s out. ""SLIME"" is out. ""SLOTH"" has O, which is excluded. ""SLASH"" is out. ""SLIME"" is out. ""SILKY"" is possible. Let\'s check: S, I, L, K, Y. All letters are allowed. The 4th letter is L, which matches the feedback. S is in the first position, so that\'s okay. So ""SILKY"" could be a candidate. But is that a valid word? Yes, SILKY is a 5-letter word.\n\nAlternatively, ""SLIME"" is out because of E. ""SILKY"" is a good candidate. But maybe there\'s another word. Let\'s think of ""SILLY"" (S-I-L-L-Y). That\'s also possible. The 4th letter is L, and S is in the first position. So that\'s allowed. But the secret word could be ""SILLY"". However, the feedback for the second guess (BOWLS) says that S is in the word but not in the 5th position. So in ""SILLY"", S is in the first position, which is correct. So that\'s possible.\n\nAnother possibility is ""SILKS"" (S-I-L-K-S). But that has two S\'s. However, the secret word would have S in position 1 and 5. But the feedback for BOWLS says that S is in the word but not in the 5th position. So if the secret word is ""SILKS"", then S is in position 5, which would contradict the feedback. Therefore, that\'s not possible. So S must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.\n\nAnother option is ""SILLY"" (S-I-L-L-Y). That\'s valid. Or ""SILKY"" (S-I-L-K-Y). Both have L in the 4th position. Let\'s check if there\'s another possibility. What about ""SILLY""? That\'s a valid word. Let\'s see. The letters would be S, I, L, L, Y. All allowed. The 4th letter is L, which matches the feedback.

Maybe ""SLUSH"" (S-L-U-S-H). But that has two S\'s. However, the secret word has S in the word, but not in the 5th position. So if the secret word is ""SLUSH"", then S is in position 1 and 4. But the 4th letter is L (from the feedback), so that\'s conflicting. So ""SLUSH"" can\'t be right. Because the 4th letter is L, so the 4th letter in the secret word is L. So ""SLUSH"" would have S in position 1 and 4, but the 4th letter is L, so that\'s not possible. Therefore, ""SLUSH"" is out.\n\nAnother possibility: ""SILLY"". Let\'s check again. The letters are S, I, L, L, Y. The 4th letter is L (correct), and S is in the first position. That\'s allowed. So that\'s a possible candidate. Alternatively, ""SILKY"" is S, I, L, K, Y. The 4th letter is L (correct), and S is in the first position. That\'s also allowed. So either could be possible.\n\nBut how do I choose between them? Well, maybe I can think of other words. Let\'s see. What about ""SILKY""? That\'s a valid word. Or ""SILLY"". Both are valid. Alternatively, ""SILKS"" is out because of the 5th position. ""SILLY"" is more likely. But I need to make a guess. Let\'s go with ""SILLY"" as the third guess. Wait, but the secret word could be ""SILLY"" or ""SILKY"". Alternatively, maybe ""SILLY"" is more likely. But I need to make a guess. Let\'s pick ""SILLY"". But wait, the feedback for the second guess (BOWLS) says that S is in the word but not in the 5th position. So if the secret word is ""SILLY"", then S is in position 1, which is correct. So that\'s allowed. So I\'ll guess ""SILLY"".\n\nBut wait, the secret word is 5 letters. Let me check again.

But wait, the feedback for the second guess (BOWLS) says that S is in the word but not in the 5th position. So if the secret word is ""SILLY"", then S is in position 1, which is allowed. So that\'s correct. So I think ""SILLY"" is a good guess. But maybe I should check for other possibilities. Another word could be ""SILKY"". Let\'s think. If the secret word is ""SILKY"", then the letters are S, I, L, K, Y. The 4th letter is L (correct), and S is in the first position. That\'s allowed. So that\'s also possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the secret word is ""SILLY"". But I need to pick one. Let\'s go with ""SILLY"". But I\'m not sure. Alternatively, maybe ""SILKY"" is better.

Okay, let's break down the feedback step by step. 

First, the secret word is a 5-letter word. The first guess was CRANE, which had all letters marked as x, meaning none of C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word. Then, the second guess was BOWLS, with feedback B(x), O(x), W(x), L(✓), S(-). So, L is in the correct position (4th letter), and S is present but in the wrong position. 

Third guess was SILLY, which gave feedback S(✓), I(x), L(✓), L(✓), Y(✓). Wait, that's interesting. Let me parse that. The letters in SILLY are S, I, L, L, Y. The feedback says S is correct (✓), so S is in the word and in the correct position (1st letter). Then I is wrong (x), so I is not in the word. The two Ls are both correct (✓), so the 3rd and 4th letters are L. And Y is correct (✓), so Y is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter). Wait, but the secret word has L in the 4th position (from the second guess's feedback), and the third guess's feedback shows that the 3rd and 4th letters are L. But the secret word is 5 letters. Wait, the third guess is SILLY, which is S-I-L-L-Y. The feedback for SILLY is S(✓), I(x), L(✓), L(✓), Y(✓). So that means:

- S is in the correct position (1st letter).
- I is not in the word.
- The 3rd and 4th letters are L (so the secret word has L in positions 3 and 4? But wait, the second guess's feedback said that L is in the correct position (4th letter). So that would mean the 4th letter is L. But the third guess's feedback says that the 3rd and 4th letters are L. So that would mean the secret word has L in both 3rd and 4th positions? But that's possible. Wait, but the secret word is 5 letters. Let me think again.

Wait, the feedback for the third guess (SILLY) is S(✓), I(x), L(✓), L(✓), Y(✓). So that means:

- S is in the correct position (1st letter).
- I is not in the word.
- The 3rd letter is L (correct position).
- The 4th letter is L (correct position).
- Y is in the correct position (5th letter).

But that would mean the secret word is S _ L L Y. However, the second guess's feedback said that L is in the correct position (4th letter). So that's consistent. So the secret word has L in the 4th position, and the third guess's feedback shows that the 3rd letter is also L. So the secret word has L in both 3rd and 4th positions. That's possible. So the secret word is S _ L L Y. But the second letter is unknown. Also, the feedback from the third guess says that Y is in the correct position (5th letter), so the secret word ends with Y. 

But wait, the third guess's feedback says that Y is correct (✓), so Y is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter). So the secret word is S _ L L Y. The second letter is unknown. Also, the secret word can't have any of the letters from CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) or BOWLS (B, O, W). So the second letter can't be any of those. Also, the letters in the secret word are S, L, L, Y, and one more letter in the second position. 

But wait, the third guess's feedback says that S is in the correct position (1st letter), so S is definitely in the secret word. Also, Y is in the 5th position. The letters L are in positions 3 and 4. So the secret word is S _ L L Y. The second letter is unknown, but it can't be any of the letters that were excluded (C, R, A, N, E, B, O, W). So possible letters for the second position are D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z. But S is already in the first position, and Y is in the fifth. Also, the secret word can't have I (since in the third guess's feedback, I was marked as x, meaning it's not in the word). So the second letter can't be I. So possible letters are D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z.

So the secret word is S _ L L Y, with the second letter being one of those. Now, the next guess should be a word that fits this pattern. Let's think of possible words. The second letter could be D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z. So possible words could be:

- S D L L Y → ""SDLLY"" (not a word)
- S F L L Y → ""SFLLY"" (not a word)
- S G L L Y → ""SGLLY"" (not a word)
- S H L L Y → ""SHLLY"" (not a word)
- S J L L Y → ""SJLLY"" (not a word)
- S K L L Y → ""SKLLY"" (not a word)
- S M L L Y → ""SMLLY"" (not a word)
- S P L L Y → ""SPLLY"" (not a word)
- S Q L L Y → ""SQLLY"" (not a word)
- S T L L Y → ""STLLY"" (not a word)
- S U L L Y → ""SULLY"" (which is a valid word, meaning a person who is a bully or a surname)
- S V L L Y → ""SVLLY"" (not a word)
- S X L L Y → ""SXLLY"" (not a word)
- S Z L L Y → ""SZLLY"" (not a word)

So the only possible valid word here is ""SULLY"". Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, ""sully"" is a word meaning to soil or defile. But wait, the secret word is S _ L L Y. So ""SULLY"" would be S-U-L-L-Y. That fits. But the second letter is U. But according to the third guess's feedback, the second letter is not I, but U is allowed. So ""SULLY"" is a possible candidate. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another word. Let me think. ""SILLY"" was the third guess, but that's already been tried. The secret word is S _ L L Y. Another possibility is ""SILLY"", but that would have I in the second position, which was marked as x in the third guess, so that's not allowed. Therefore, ""SULLY"" is the only valid word that fits the pattern. 

So the next guess should be ""SULLY"". Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, ""sully"" is a valid 5-letter word. So I'll go with that as the fourth guess.

<guess>SULLY</guess>",SULLY,"Okay, let's break down the feedback step by step. 

First, the secret word is a 5-letter word. The first guess was CRANE, which had all letters marked as x, meaning none of C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word. Then, the second guess was BOWLS, with feedback B(x), O(x), W(x), L(✓), S(-). So, L is in the correct position (4th letter), and S is present but in the wrong position. 

Third guess was SILLY, which gave feedback S(✓), I(x), L(✓), L(✓), Y(✓). Wait, that's interesting. Let me parse that. The letters in SILLY are S, I, L, L, Y. The feedback says S is correct (✓), so S is in the word and in the correct position (1st letter). Then I is wrong (x), so I is not in the word. The two Ls are both correct (✓), so the 3rd and 4th letters are L. And Y is correct (✓), so Y is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter). Wait, but the secret word has L in the 4th position (from the second guess's feedback), and the third guess's feedback shows that the 3rd and 4th letters are L. But the secret word is 5 letters. Wait, the third guess is SILLY, which is S-I-L-L-Y. The feedback for SILLY is S(✓), I(x), L(✓), L(✓), Y(✓). So that means:

- S is in the correct position (1st letter).
- I is not in the word.
- The 3rd and 4th letters are L (so the secret word has L in positions 3 and 4? But wait, the second guess's feedback said that L is in the correct position (4th letter). So that would mean the 4th letter is L. But the third guess's feedback says that the 3rd and 4th letters are L. So that would mean the secret word has L in both 3rd and 4th positions? But that's possible. Wait, but the secret word is 5 letters. Let me think again.

Wait, the feedback for the third guess (SILLY) is S(✓), I(x), L(✓), L(✓), Y(✓). So that means:

- S is in the correct position (1st letter).
- I is not in the word.
- The 3rd letter is L (correct position).
- The 4th letter is L (correct position).
- Y is in the correct position (5th letter).

But that would mean the secret word is S _ L L Y. However, the second guess's feedback said that L is in the correct position (4th letter). So that's consistent. So the secret word has L in the 4th position, and the third guess's feedback shows that the 3rd letter is also L. So the secret word has L in both 3rd and 4th positions. That's possible. So the secret word is S _ L L Y. But the second letter is unknown. Also, the feedback from the third guess says that Y is in the correct position (5th letter), so the secret word ends with Y. 

But wait, the third guess's feedback says that Y is correct (✓), so Y is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter). So the secret word is S _ L L Y. The second letter is unknown. Also, the secret word can't have any of the letters from CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) or BOWLS (B, O, W). So the second letter can't be any of those. Also, the letters in the secret word are S, L, L, Y, and one more letter in the second position. 

But wait, the third guess's feedback says that S is in the correct position (1st letter), so S is definitely in the secret word. Also, Y is in the 5th position. The letters L are in positions 3 and 4. So the secret word is S _ L L Y. The second letter is unknown, but it can't be any of the letters that were excluded (C, R, A, N, E, B, O, W). So possible letters for the second position are D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z. But S is already in the first position, and Y is in the fifth. Also, the secret word can't have I (since in the third guess's feedback, I was marked as x, meaning it's not in the word). So the second letter can't be I. So possible letters are D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z.

So the secret word is S _ L L Y, with the second letter being one of those. Now, the next guess should be a word that fits this pattern. Let's think of possible words. The second letter could be D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Z. So possible words could be:

- S D L L Y → ""SDLLY"" (not a word)
- S F L L Y → ""SFLLY"" (not a word)
- S G L L Y → ""SGLLY"" (not a word)
- S H L L Y → ""SHLLY"" (not a word)
- S J L L Y → ""SJLLY"" (not a word)
- S K L L Y → ""SKLLY"" (not a word)
- S M L L Y → ""SMLLY"" (not a word)
- S P L L Y → ""SPLLY"" (not a word)
- S Q L L Y → ""SQLLY"" (not a word)
- S T L L Y → ""STLLY"" (not a word)
- S U L L Y → ""SULLY"" (which is a valid word, meaning a person who is a bully or a surname)
- S V L L Y → ""SVLLY"" (not a word)
- S X L L Y → ""SXLLY"" (not a word)
- S Z L L Y → ""SZLLY"" (not a word)

So the only possible valid word here is ""SULLY"". Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, ""sully"" is a word meaning to soil or defile. But wait, the secret word is S _ L L Y. So ""SULLY"" would be S-U-L-L-Y. That fits. But the second letter is U. But according to the third guess's feedback, the second letter is not I, but U is allowed. So ""SULLY"" is a possible candidate. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another word. Let me think. ""SILLY"" was the third guess, but that's already been tried. The secret word is S _ L L Y. Another possibility is ""SILLY"", but that would have I in the second position, which was marked as x in the third guess, so that's not allowed. Therefore, ""SULLY"" is the only valid word that fits the pattern. 

So the next guess should be ""SULLY"". Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, ""sully"" is a valid 5-letter word. So I'll go with that as the fourth guess.",Guess 4: SULLY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) U(✓) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
