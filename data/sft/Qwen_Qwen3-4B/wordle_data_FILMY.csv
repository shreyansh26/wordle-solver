Okay, let's see. I need to guess a 5-letter word. The user hasn't given any feedback yet, so I have to choose a word that's common and might have some letters that could be in the secret word. Maybe start with a word that has common letters. Let me think... Words like ""CRANE"" or ""STARS"" come to mind. Wait, but maybe ""CRANE"" is too specific. Alternatively, ""BRAVE"" is a good one because it has letters that are common in many words. Or maybe ""RADIO""? Hmm. Wait, the example used ""BRISK"" as the secret word. But since I don't know the secret word, I need to pick a word that's likely. Let me go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess. It's a 5-letter word with letters that are common. Alternatively, ""STARS"" is another option. But maybe ""CRANE"" is better. Wait, but I should pick a word that's more common. Maybe ""CRANE"" is okay. Let me check if it's a valid 5-letter word. Yes, it is. So I'll go with CRANE as my first guess.

Okay, let's see. The user has given me feedback for my first two guesses. The first guess was CRANE, and all letters were x, meaning none of them are in the secret word. Then, my second guess was FLUSH, and the feedback was F(✓), L(-), U(x), S(x), H(x). So that means the letter F is in the secret word and is in the correct position (since it's a ✓). The letter L is present but in the wrong position (-). U, S, H are not in the word (x).

So now, I need to figure out the secret word. Let's note down what we know so far.

Secret word is 5 letters. From the first guess, it doesn't contain C, R, A, N, E. From the second guess, F is present and in the first position (since it's a ✓). The letter L is in the word but not in the second position (since it's a -). The letters U, S, H are not in the word.

So the secret word has F as the first letter. The other letters can't be C, R, A, N, E, U, S, H. Wait, no, the letters that are excluded are C, R, A, N, E from the first guess. But from the second guess, U, S, H are also excluded. So the secret word can't have any of C, R, A, N, E, U, S, H. Wait, but the second guess's feedback says that L is present but in the wrong position. So L is in the word, but not in position 2. So the secret word has L somewhere else. Also, F is in position 1.

So the letters allowed are: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. Wait, but the secret word has F as the first letter, and L is present. Also, the secret word is 5 letters. Let's think about possible letters.

So the secret word starts with F. The second letter can't be L (since in the second guess, L was in position 2 and it's a -), so L must be in position 3, 4, or 5. Also, the secret word can't have any of the letters C, R, A, N, E, U, S, H. So letters allowed are B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. But F is already in position 1. So the remaining letters are positions 2, 3, 4, 5. Let's think of possible letters.

We know that L is in the word. So one of the positions 2,3,4,5 is L. Also, the secret word can't have any of the letters that were excluded. Let's try to think of words starting with F, containing L, and not having the excluded letters.

Possible words: F...L...? Let's think. Maybe ""FLAME"" but A is excluded. ""FLUSH"" was the previous guess, but S is excluded. ""FLUID"" has I, D, U (U is excluded). No. ""FLINT"" has I, N (N is excluded). No. ""FLAME"" is out. ""FLUSH"" is out. ""FLEET"" has E (excluded). ""FLAME"" is out. ""FLINT"" has N. ""FLUSH"" is out. ""FLAKE"" has A. Hmm. Maybe ""FLEET"" is out. Wait, maybe ""FLYER"" but E is excluded. ""FLYER"" is F, L, Y, E, R. E and R are excluded. No. ""FLYER"" is out. ""FLUSH"" is out. ""FLINT"" is out. ""FLEET"" is out. Hmm. Maybe the secret word is ""FLOPS""? But S is excluded. No. ""FLOPS"" has S. ""FLUSH"" has S. ""FLUSH"" is out. ""FLAME"" is out. ""FLINT"" is out. ""FLUSH"" is out. Wait, maybe the secret word is ""FLUID""? But U is excluded. ""FLUID"" has U. No. ""FLUID"" is out. ""FLYER"" is out. ""FLUSH"" is out. Hmm. Maybe the secret word is ""FLOCK""? Let's check. F, L, O, C, K. C is excluded. No. ""FLOCK"" is out. ""FLYER"" is out. ""FLUSH"" is out. ""FLINT"" is out. ""FLAME"" is out. ""FLUID"" is out. ""FLUSH"" is out. ""FLYER"" is out. ""FLAME"" is out. ""FLUSH"" is out. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The secret word starts with F, has L, and the other letters can't be in the excluded list. Let's think of possible letters. Maybe the secret word is ""FLEET""? But E is excluded. No. ""FLEET"" is out. ""FLUSH"" is out. ""FLINT"" is out. ""FLAME"" is out. ""FLUSH"" is out. Wait, maybe the secret word is ""FLUKE""? But E is excluded. No. ""FLUKE"" is out. ""FLUSH"" is out. ""FLUID"" is out. ""FLOPS"" is out. ""FLOCK"" is out. Hmm. Maybe the secret word is ""FLUKE"" but E is excluded. No. Wait, maybe the secret word is ""FLEET"" but E is excluded. Hmm. Maybe I need to think of other possibilities. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FLUSH"" but S is excluded. Wait, but in the second guess, the feedback for S was x, so S is not in the word. So ""FLUSH"" is out. So maybe the secret word is ""FLINT"" but N is excluded. No. Hmm. Maybe the secret word is ""FLUSH"" but S is excluded. Wait, but the secret word can't have S. So that's not possible. Maybe the secret word is ""FLEET"" but E is excluded. So that's not possible. Hmm. Maybe I need to think of a different approach. Let's think of words that start with F, have L, and don't have any of the excluded letters. Let's think of possible letters for the other positions. The second letter can't be L (since in the second guess, L was in position 2 and it's a -). So the L must be in position 3, 4, or 5. Let's try to think of words where F is first, and L is in another position. For example, ""FOLKS"" but S is excluded. ""FOLKS"" is out. ""FOLLY"" has L, but Y is allowed. Wait, ""FOLLY"" is F, O, L, L, Y. But O is allowed. But the secret word can't have any of the excluded letters. Wait, the secret word can't have C, R, A, N, E, U, S, H. So O is allowed. So ""FOLLY"" would be F, O, L, L, Y. But the secret word is 5 letters. However, in the second guess, the feedback for L was -, meaning that L is in the word but not in position 2. So if the secret word is ""FOLLY"", then L is in position 3 and 4. But the feedback for the second guess (FLUSH) had L in position 2 as -, so that's correct. But the secret word could be ""FOLLY"". However, ""FOLLY"" has O and Y, which are allowed. But is ""FOLLY"" a valid word? Yes. But wait, the secret word is 5 letters. Let me check. F, O, L, L, Y. That's 5 letters. But the secret word could be that. However, the feedback for the second guess (FLUSH) had F(✓), L(-), U(x), S(x), H(x). So in the second guess, the L was in position 2, which is a -, meaning that L is in the word but not in position 2. So if the secret word is ""FOLLY"", then L is in positions 3 and 4. That would fit. But then, in the second guess, the L was in position 2, which is not the correct position, so the feedback is -, which matches. So that's possible. But is ""FOLLY"" a valid word? Yes. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FLOPS"", but S is excluded. No. ""FLOPS"" is out. ""FLOES"" has S. No. ""FLOES"" is out. ""FLOPS"" is out. ""FLUKE"" is out. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FLUSH"" but that's out because S is excluded. Wait, but the secret word can't have S. So that's not possible. So maybe ""FOLLY"" is the secret word. But let me think again. Another possibility: ""FLOCK"" is out because C is excluded. ""FLINT"" is out because N is excluded. ""FLUSH"" is out because S is excluded. ""FLAME"" is out because A is excluded. ""FLUID"" is out because U is excluded. ""FLYER"" is out because E and R are excluded. So maybe ""FOLLY"" is the secret word. But let's check if that's possible. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FLUSH"" but that's not allowed. Wait, but the secret word can't have S. So that's not possible. So maybe ""FOLLY"" is the answer. But I need to check if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FLUSH"" but that's not possible. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FLEET"" but E is excluded. No. ""FLEET"" is out. Hmm. Maybe I need to think of other words. Let's think of words starting with F, containing L, and not having any of the excluded letters. Let's try ""FLEET"" again. No. ""FLEET"" has E. ""FLEET"" is out. ""FLEET"" is out. ""FLEET"" is out. Hmm. Maybe ""FLEET"" is not possible. So perhaps the secret word is ""FOLLY"". Let me check. F, O, L, L, Y. All letters are allowed. The secret word is 5 letters. So that's possible. So my next guess could be ""FOLLY"". But I need to make sure that the letters in my guess don't include any of the excluded letters. Let me check: F is allowed, O is allowed, L is allowed, L is allowed, Y is allowed. Yes. So ""FOLLY"" is a valid guess. But wait, the secret word could be ""FOLLY"". But I need to make sure that the feedback from the third guess would be correct. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FLOPS"" but S is excluded. No. So maybe ""FOLLY"" is the correct guess. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FLUSH"" but that's not allowed. So I think ""FOLLY"" is the best guess now. Let me go with that.

<guess>FOLLY</guess>",FOLLY,"Okay, let's see. The user has given me feedback for my first two guesses. The first guess was CRANE, and all letters were x, meaning none of them are in the secret word. Then, my second guess was FLUSH, and the feedback was F(✓), L(-), U(x), S(x), H(x). So that means the letter F is in the secret word and is in the correct position (since it's a ✓). The letter L is present but in the wrong position (-). U, S, H are not in the word (x).

So now, I need to figure out the secret word. Let's note down what we know so far.

Okay, let's see. I need to guess a 5-letter word. The user hasn't given any feedback yet, so I have to choose a word that's common and might have some letters that could be in the secret word. Maybe start with a word that has common letters. Let me think... Words like ""CRANE"" or ""STARS"" come to mind. Wait, but maybe ""CRANE"" is too specific. Alternatively, ""BRAVE"" is a good one because it has letters that are common in many words. Or maybe ""RADIO""? Hmm. Wait, the example used ""BRISK"" as the secret word. But since I don't know the secret word, I need to pick a word that's likely. Let me go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess. It's a 5-letter word with letters that are common. Alternatively, ""STARS"" is another option. But maybe ""CRANE"" is better. Wait, but I should pick a word that's more common. Maybe ""CRANE"" is okay. Let me check if it's a valid 5-letter word. Yes, it is. So I'll go with CRANE as my first guess.

Okay, so my first guess was CRANE, and all the letters are x, meaning none of them are in the secret word. That's helpful. So the secret word doesn't have C, R, A, N, or E. So I need to think of a 5-letter word that doesn't include any of those letters. Let me think. The letters allowed can't be C, R, A, N, E. So possible letters are B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Wait, but the secret word is 5 letters. Let me think of words that don't have those letters. Maybe words with letters like B, D, F, G, etc. Let's see. Words like ""BRAVE"" have A and E, which are excluded. So not that. Maybe ""BLOGS""? Wait, but that has O, which is allowed. Wait, but let me check. The secret word can't have C, R, A, N, E. So letters allowed are B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. So possible letters. Let me think of a 5-letter word. Maybe ""BLOGS""? But that has O and S. Wait, but the secret word could be something like ""BLOGS""? But I need to check if that's allowed. Alternatively, ""FLUKE"" has F, L, U, K, E. Oh, E is excluded. So no. ""FLUKE"" has E, which is invalid. How about ""FLUSH""? F, L, U, S, H. All allowed letters. But is ""FLUSH"" a valid word? Yes. But maybe the secret word is something else. Alternatively, ""STUMP"" has S, T, U, M, P. All allowed letters. Wait, but the secret word is 5 letters. Let me think again. Maybe ""STUMP"" is a good candidate. But I need to make sure that none of the letters in my guess are in the secret word. Wait, no, the feedback is for the letters in my guess. Since my first guess was CRANE, all letters are x, meaning the secret word doesn't have any of those letters. So my next guess should be a word that doesn't have any of those letters. Wait, but my next guess could have letters that are in the secret word, but the feedback will tell me. So maybe I should pick a word that has letters that are more likely. Let's think of words that don't have C, R, A, N, E. Let me try ""BLOGS"". B, L, O, G, S. None of those letters are in CRANE. So that's allowed. But maybe ""BLOGS"" is a good guess. Alternatively, ""STUMP"" is another option. Let me check if ""STUMP"" is valid. Yes. So maybe ""STUMP"" is a better guess. Let me go with STUMP. Alternatively, ""BLAST"" has A, which is excluded. So no. ""BLAST"" is out. ""FLUSH"" is allowed. Let me think. Maybe ""FLUSH"" is a good guess. But I need to pick one. Let me go with ""STUMP"" as the second guess. Wait, but maybe ""FLUSH"" is better. Hmm. Alternatively, ""BLAST"" is out because of A. So maybe ""FLUSH"" is better. Let me check again. The secret word can't have C, R, A, N, E. So ""FLUSH"" has F, L, U, S, H. All allowed. So that's a valid guess. So I'll go with FLUSH as my second guess.

Okay, let's see. The user has given me feedback for my first two guesses. The first guess was CRANE, and all letters were x, meaning none of them are in the secret word.

The letter L is present but in the wrong position (-). U, S, H are not in the word (x).

So now, I need to figure out the secret word. Let's note down what we know so far.

Secret word is 5 letters. From the first guess, it doesn't contain C, R, A, N, E. From the second guess, F is present and in the first position (since it's a ✓). The letter L is in the word but not in the second position (since it's a -). The letters U, S, H are not in the word.

So the secret word starts with F. The second letter can't be L (since in the second guess, L was in position 2 and it's a -), so L must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

So the remaining letters are positions 2, 3, 4, 5. Let's think of possible letters.

We know that L is in the word. So one of the positions 2,3,4,5 is L. Also, the secret word can't have any of the letters that were excluded. Let's try to think of words starting with F, containing L, and not having the excluded letters.

Maybe the secret word is ""FLUSH"" but S is excluded. Wait, but the secret word can't have S. So that's not possible. Maybe the secret word is ""FLEET"" but E is excluded. So that's not possible. Hmm. Maybe I need to think of a different approach. Let's think of words that start with F, have L, and don't have any of the excluded letters. Let's think of possible letters for the other positions. The second letter can't be L (since in the second guess, L was in position 2 and it's a -). So the L must be in position 3, 4, or 5. Let's try to think of words where F is first, and L is in another position. For example, ""FOLKS"" but S is excluded. ""FOLKS"" is out. ""FOLLY"" has L, but Y is allowed. Wait, ""FOLLY"" is F, O, L, L, Y. But O is allowed. But the secret word can't have any of the excluded letters. Wait, the secret word can't have C, R, A, N, E, U, S, H. So O is allowed. So ""FOLLY"" would be F, O, L, L, Y. But the secret word is 5 letters. However, in the second guess, the feedback for L was -, meaning that L is in the word but not in position 2. So if the secret word is ""FOLLY"", then L is in position 3 and 4. But the feedback for the second guess (FLUSH) had L in position 2 as -, so that's correct. But the secret word could be ""FOLLY"". However, ""FOLLY"" has O and Y, which are allowed. But is ""FOLLY"" a valid word? Yes. But wait, the secret word is 5 letters. Let me check. F, O, L, L, Y. That's 5 letters. But the secret word could be that. However, the feedback for the second guess (FLUSH) had F(✓), L(-), U(x), S(x), H(x). So in the second guess, the L was in position 2, which is a -, meaning that L is in the word but not in position 2. So if the secret word is ""FOLLY"", then L is in positions 3 and 4. That would fit. But then, in the second guess, the L was in position 2, which is not the correct position, so the feedback is -, which matches. So that's possible. But is ""FOLLY"" a valid word? Yes. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FLOPS"", but S is excluded. No. ""FLOPS"" is out. ""FLOES"" has S. No. ""FLOES"" is out. ""FLOPS"" is out. ""FLUKE"" is out. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FLUSH"" but that's out because S is excluded. Wait, but the secret word can't have S. So that's not possible. So maybe ""FOLLY"" is the secret word. But let me think again. Another possibility: ""FLOCK"" is out because C is excluded. ""FLINT"" is out because N is excluded. ""FLUSH"" is out because S is excluded. ""FLAME"" is out because A is excluded. ""FLUID"" is out because U is excluded. ""FLYER"" is out because E and R are excluded. So maybe ""FOLLY"" is the secret word. But let's check if that's possible. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FLUSH"" but that's not allowed. Wait, but the secret word can't have S. So that's not possible. So maybe ""FOLLY"" is the answer. But I need to check if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FLUSH"" but that's not possible. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FLEET"" but E is excluded. No. ""FLEET"" is out. Hmm. Maybe I need to think of other words. Let's think of words starting with F, containing L, and not having any of the excluded letters. Let's try ""FLEET"" again. No. ""FLEET"" has E. ""FLEET"" is out. ""FLEET"" is out. ""FLEET"" is out. Hmm. Maybe ""FLEET"" is not possible. So perhaps the secret word is ""FOLLY"". Let me check. F, O, L, L, Y. All letters are allowed. The secret word is 5 letters. So that's possible. So my next guess could be ""FOLLY"". But I need to make sure that the letters in my guess don't include any of the excluded letters. Let me check: F is allowed, O is allowed, L is allowed, L is allowed, Y is allowed. Yes. So ""FOLLY"" is a valid guess. But wait, the secret word could be ""FOLLY"". But I need to make sure that the feedback from the third guess would be correct. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FLOPS"" but S is excluded. No. So maybe ""FOLLY"" is the correct guess. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FLUSH"" but that's not allowed. So I think ""FOLLY"" is the best guess now. Let me go with that.

Okay, let's break down the feedback step by step. 

First, the secret word is 5 letters. From the first guess, CRANE, all letters were x, meaning none of C, R, A, N, E are in the word. Then, the second guess was FLUSH, which gave F(✓), L(-), U(x), S(x), H(x). So F is in the correct position (first letter), L is present but not in the second position, and U, S, H are not in the word. 

Third guess was FOLLY, which resulted in F(✓), O(x), L(✓), L(-), Y(✓). So F is correct (first letter), O is not in the word, L is present but not in the third position (since the third letter in FOLLY is L, but the feedback says L(-)), and Y is in the word. Wait, the feedback for FOLLY is F(✓) O(x) L(✓) L(-) Y(✓). Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me parse it again. 

The third guess is FOLLY. The feedback is F(✓) O(x) L(✓) L(-) Y(✓). So:

- F is correct (position 1).
- O is not in the word.
- The second L (position 3) is in the word but in the wrong position? Wait, the third letter in FOLLY is L, and the feedback says L(✓) for position 3? Wait, no, the feedback is for each letter in the guess. Let me check again. 

Wait, the third guess is FOLLY. The letters are F, O, L, L, Y. The feedback is F(✓), O(x), L(✓), L(-), Y(✓). So:

- F is correct (position 1).
- O is not in the word.
- The third letter is L, which is in the word but in the wrong position (so that's a -? Or is it a ✓? Wait, the feedback says L(✓) for the third position? Wait, the third letter in the guess is L, and the feedback says L(✓), but then the fourth letter is L with a (-). That seems confusing. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the feedback. Let me re-examine the feedback format.

The feedback for each letter in the guess is:

For guess 3: FOLLY -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) O(x) L(✓) L(-) Y(✓)

So:

- First letter F: ✓ (correct position)
- Second letter O: x (not in the word)
- Third letter L: ✓ (in the word but in the correct position? But that would mean the third letter is correct. But the secret word's third letter is L? But in the second guess, FLUSH had L in position 2, which was a -, meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. Now, in the third guess, the third letter is L, which is a ✓, meaning that L is in the correct position (third position). But that would mean that the secret word has L in position 3. However, in the second guess, the L was in position 2, which was a -, so L is in the word but not in position 2. So if in the third guess, the L is in position 3 and is a ✓, that would mean that the secret word has L in position 3. So that's possible. Then, the fourth letter in the guess is L, which is a -, meaning that L is in the word but not in position 4. But since the third letter is already L (✓), that would mean that there's only one L in the word. Wait, but the third guess has two Ls. So maybe the secret word has one L in position 3. The fourth letter in the guess is L, which is a -, meaning that the secret word has L but not in position 4. So that's possible. Then, the fifth letter Y is a ✓, meaning Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So putting it all together, the secret word starts with F (position 1), has L in position 3, and Y in position 5. Also, the secret word does not contain O (from the third guess's O(x)), and does not contain U, S, H (from the second guess). Also, from the first guess, no C, R, A, N, E. 

So the secret word is F _ L _ Y. The letters in positions 2 and 4 need to be determined. The letters allowed are B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. But O is excluded (from the third guess's O(x)), so O is out. Also, the secret word can't have any of C, R, A, N, E, U, S, H. So possible letters for position 2 and 4 are B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. But F is already in position 1, and L is in position 3. Y is in position 5. So positions 2 and 4 can be filled with other letters. 

So the secret word is F _ L _ Y. Let's think of possible letters for position 2 and 4. 

Possible letters for position 2: B, D, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z. 

Possible letters for position 4: same as above. 

Let me think of words that fit this pattern. For example, ""FILLY"" but that has two Ls. Wait, but the secret word has L in position 3. So maybe ""FILLY"" is possible. But ""FILLY"" has F, I, L, L, Y. But the third letter is L (✓), and the fourth letter is L (but in the third guess, the fourth letter was L with a -, which would mean that the secret word has L but not in position 4. So ""FILLY"" would have two Ls, one in position 3 and one in position 4. But the feedback for the third guess's fourth letter is L(-), meaning that the secret word has L but not in position 4. Therefore, ""FILLY"" would have L in position 4, which would conflict with the feedback. So that's not possible. Therefore, the secret word can't have L in position 4. So the secret word has L in position 3 only. 

So the secret word is F _ L _ Y. Let's think of possible words. 

Possible options: ""FILLY"" is out because of the second L. ""FILLY"" is F, I, L, L, Y. But the fourth letter is L, which would be a - in the third guess, which is not allowed. So that's not possible. 

Another option: ""FILLY"" is out. What about ""FILMY""? F, I, L, M, Y. That's 5 letters. Let's check if that's possible. The letters would be F (position 1), I (position 2), L (position 3), M (position 4), Y (position 5). 

Check if this fits the feedback. 

From the third guess (FOLLY), the feedback was F(✓), O(x), L(✓), L(-), Y(✓). So the secret word has F, L, Y. The third letter is L (✓), so that's correct. The fourth letter in the guess is L, which is a -, meaning that the secret word has L but not in position 4. So if the secret word is FILMY, then the fourth letter is M, which is allowed. So that's possible. 

Another possibility: ""FILMY"" is a valid word. Let's check if that fits. 

Alternatively, ""FILMY"" has F, I, L, M, Y. All letters are allowed (no C, R, A, N, E, U, S, H, O). 

So that's a possibility. 

Another option: ""FILLY"" is out. ""FILMY"" is possible. 

Alternatively, ""FILLY"" is not allowed because of the second L. 

Another possibility: ""FILMY"". 

So my next guess could be FILMY. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, ""FILMY"" is a 5-letter word. 

Alternatively, ""FILLY"" is not allowed. 

Another option: ""FILMY"". 

So I think ""FILMY"" is the correct guess. Let me check the letters again. 

Secret word: F (1), I (2), L (3), M (4), Y (5). 

Check if this fits all the feedback. 

From the first guess (CRANE), none of the letters are in the secret word. Correct, since the secret word has F, I, L, M, Y. 

From the second guess (FLUSH): F is in position 1 (✓), L is in the word but not in position 2 (since in the guess, L is in position 2, which is a -, so that's correct. The secret word has L in position 3. 

From the third guess (FOLLY): F is in position 1 (✓), O is not in the word (x), L is in position 3 (✓), but the fourth letter in the guess is L (position 4), which is a -, meaning that the secret word has L but not in position 4. Since the secret word has L in position 3, that's correct. The fifth letter Y is in the word (✓). 

So FILMY would fit all the feedback. 

Therefore, my next guess is FILMY. 

But wait, the secret word is FILMY? Let me check if that's possible. 

Yes. So the answer would be FILMY. 

But let me make sure there's no other possible word. Another possibility could be ""FILLY"", but that's not allowed. ""FILMY"" seems correct. 

So the next guess is FILMY.
</think>

<guess>FILMY</guess>",FILMY,"Okay, let's break down the feedback step by step. 

First, the secret word is 5 letters. From the first guess, CRANE, all letters were x, meaning none of C, R, A, N, E are in the word. Then, the second guess was FLUSH, which gave F(✓), L(-), U(x), S(x), H(x). So F is in the correct position (first letter), L is present but not in the second position, and U, S, H are not in the word. 

Third guess was FOLLY, which resulted in F(✓), O(x), L(✓), L(-), Y(✓). So F is correct (first letter), O is not in the word, L is present but not in the third position (since the third letter in FOLLY is L, but the feedback says L(-)), and Y is in the word. Wait, the feedback for FOLLY is F(✓) O(x) L(✓) L(-) Y(✓). Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me parse it again. 

The third guess is FOLLY. The feedback is F(✓) O(x) L(✓) L(-) Y(✓). So:

- F is correct (position 1).
- O is not in the word.
- The second L (position 3) is in the word but in the wrong position? Wait, the third letter in FOLLY is L, and the feedback says L(✓) for position 3? Wait, no, the feedback is for each letter in the guess. Let me check again. 

Wait, the third guess is FOLLY. The letters are F, O, L, L, Y. The feedback is F(✓), O(x), L(✓), L(-), Y(✓). So:

- F is correct (position 1).
- O is not in the word.
- The third letter is L, which is in the word but in the wrong position (so that's a -? Or is it a ✓? Wait, the feedback says L(✓) for the third position? Wait, the third letter in the guess is L, and the feedback says L(✓), but then the fourth letter is L with a (-). That seems confusing. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the feedback. Let me re-examine the feedback format.

The feedback for each letter in the guess is:

For guess 3: FOLLY -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) O(x) L(✓) L(-) Y(✓)

So:

- First letter F: ✓ (correct position)
- Second letter O: x (not in the word)
- Third letter L: ✓ (in the word but in the correct position? But that would mean the third letter is correct. But the secret word's third letter is L? But in the second guess, FLUSH had L in position 2, which was a -, meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. Now, in the third guess, the third letter is L, which is a ✓, meaning that L is in the correct position (third position). But that would mean that the secret word has L in position 3. However, in the second guess, the L was in position 2, which was a -, so L is in the word but not in position 2. So if in the third guess, the L is in position 3 and is a ✓, that would mean that the secret word has L in position 3. So that's possible. Then, the fourth letter in the guess is L, which is a -, meaning that L is in the word but not in position 4. But since the third letter is already L (✓), that would mean that there's only one L in the word. Wait, but the third guess has two Ls. So maybe the secret word has one L in position 3. The fourth letter in the guess is L, which is a -, meaning that the secret word has L but not in position 4. So that's possible. Then, the fifth letter Y is a ✓, meaning Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So putting it all together, the secret word starts with F (position 1), has L in position 3, and Y in position 5. Also, the secret word does not contain O (from the third guess's O(x)), and does not contain U, S, H (from the second guess). Also, from the first guess, no C, R, A, N, E. 

So the secret word is F _ L _ Y. The letters in positions 2 and 4 need to be determined. The letters allowed are B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. But O is excluded (from the third guess's O(x)), so O is out. Also, the secret word can't have any of C, R, A, N, E, U, S, H. So possible letters for position 2 and 4 are B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. But F is already in position 1, and L is in position 3. Y is in position 5. So positions 2 and 4 can be filled with other letters. 

So the secret word is F _ L _ Y. Let's think of possible letters for position 2 and 4. 

Possible letters for position 2: B, D, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z. 

Possible letters for position 4: same as above. 

Let me think of words that fit this pattern. For example, ""FILLY"" but that has two Ls. Wait, but the secret word has L in position 3. So maybe ""FILLY"" is possible. But ""FILLY"" has F, I, L, L, Y. But the third letter is L (✓), and the fourth letter is L (but in the third guess, the fourth letter was L with a -, which would mean that the secret word has L but not in position 4. So ""FILLY"" would have two Ls, one in position 3 and one in position 4. But the feedback for the third guess's fourth letter is L(-), meaning that the secret word has L but not in position 4. Therefore, ""FILLY"" would have L in position 4, which would conflict with the feedback. So that's not possible. Therefore, the secret word can't have L in position 4. So the secret word has L in position 3 only. 

So the secret word is F _ L _ Y. Let's think of possible words. 

Possible options: ""FILLY"" is out because of the second L. ""FILLY"" is F, I, L, L, Y. But the fourth letter is L, which would be a - in the third guess, which is not allowed. So that's not possible. 

Another option: ""FILLY"" is out. What about ""FILMY""? F, I, L, M, Y. That's 5 letters. Let's check if that's possible. The letters would be F (position 1), I (position 2), L (position 3), M (position 4), Y (position 5). 

Check if this fits the feedback. 

From the third guess (FOLLY), the feedback was F(✓), O(x), L(✓), L(-), Y(✓). So the secret word has F, L, Y. The third letter is L (✓), so that's correct. The fourth letter in the guess is L, which is a -, meaning that the secret word has L but not in position 4. So if the secret word is FILMY, then the fourth letter is M, which is allowed. So that's possible. 

Another possibility: ""FILMY"" is a valid word. Let's check if that fits. 

Alternatively, ""FILMY"" has F, I, L, M, Y. All letters are allowed (no C, R, A, N, E, U, S, H, O). 

So that's a possibility. 

Another option: ""FILLY"" is out. ""FILMY"" is possible. 

Alternatively, ""FILLY"" is not allowed because of the second L. 

Another possibility: ""FILMY"". 

So my next guess could be FILMY. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, ""FILMY"" is a 5-letter word. 

Alternatively, ""FILLY"" is not allowed. 

Another option: ""FILMY"". 

So I think ""FILMY"" is the correct guess. Let me check the letters again. 

Secret word: F (1), I (2), L (3), M (4), Y (5). 

Check if this fits all the feedback. 

From the first guess (CRANE), none of the letters are in the secret word. Correct, since the secret word has F, I, L, M, Y. 

From the second guess (FLUSH): F is in position 1 (✓), L is in the word but not in position 2 (since in the guess, L is in position 2, which is a -, so that's correct. The secret word has L in position 3. 

From the third guess (FOLLY): F is in position 1 (✓), O is not in the word (x), L is in position 3 (✓), but the fourth letter in the guess is L (position 4), which is a -, meaning that the secret word has L but not in position 4. Since the secret word has L in position 3, that's correct. The fifth letter Y is in the word (✓). 

So FILMY would fit all the feedback. 

Therefore, my next guess is FILMY. 

But wait, the secret word is FILMY? Let me check if that's possible. 

Yes. So the answer would be FILMY. 

But let me make sure there's no other possible word. Another possibility could be ""FILLY"", but that's not allowed. ""FILMY"" seems correct. 

So the next guess is FILMY.",Guess 4: FILMY -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) I(✓) L(✓) M(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
