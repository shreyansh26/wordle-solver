Okay, let's see. I need to guess a 5-letter word. The secret word is somewhere in the list of possible 5-letter English words. Since I don't have any feedback yet, my first guess should be a word that's common and might have letters that could be in the secret word. Maybe something like ""CRANE"" because it's a common word and has a mix of letters. Wait, but maybe ""CRANE"" is too specific. Alternatively, ""STARS"" is another common word. Or maybe ""BRAVE"" since it's a common word with multiple letters that could be in the secret word. Hmm. Let me think. Since the example used ""BRISK"" and the feedback for ""BRAVE"" had two correct letters, maybe a word with vowels and consonants that are common. Maybe ""CRANE"" is a good first guess. Or ""STARS"" because it's a common word. Alternatively, ""TRUST"" is another possibility. Wait, but I should pick a word that's likely to have letters that are in the secret word. Let me go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess. If that's not right, the feedback will help me adjust. Alternatively, maybe ""BRAVE"" is better because it has letters that are common in many words. Let me check. Wait, the example had ""BRISK"" as the secret word, and ""BRAVE"" had two correct letters. So maybe ""BRAVE"" is a good first guess. But I need to make sure it's a valid 5-letter word.

Okay, let's see. The first guess was BRAVE, and the feedback was B(✓), which means the letter B is in the correct position. The other letters R, A, V, E are not in the word. So the secret word has B in the first position. Wait, no, the feedback says B(✓), so that means the B is in the correct position. So the first letter is B. The other letters in BRAVE (R, A, V, E) are not in the word. So the secret word starts with B, and the other letters are not R, A, V, or E.

So now, I need to think of a 5-letter word starting with B, and not containing R, A, V, or E. Let's think. Possible letters for the other positions. Let's consider possible words. Let's think of words starting with B, and without R, A, V, E. So letters allowed in the other positions could be C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Y, Z. But the secret word is a 5-letter English word.

So possible words: B... Let's think. Maybe ""BROWN""? Wait, but that has an O and W, but the secret word might have those. Wait, but the feedback for the first guess didn't indicate any of those letters. Wait, the first guess was BRAVE, and the feedback was B(✓) and the rest x. So the secret word does not have R, A, V, or E. So the secret word can't have those letters. So the other letters in the secret word must be from the remaining letters. So, for example, if the secret word is BROWN, but that has O and W, which are allowed. But wait, the first guess was BRAVE, and the secret word doesn't have A, E, R, V. So the secret word can have O, W, etc. So possible words starting with B, and not containing A, E, R, V.

So possible words: BROWN, BUTTS, BAGEL (but that has A, which is excluded), BONDS, BONSAI (too long), BONDS, BOLTS, BONDS, BONDS. Wait, BONDS is 5 letters. B-O-N-D-S. Let me check if that's valid. Yes, BONDS is a valid word. But the secret word could be BONDS. Alternatively, BROWN. Let's think of other possibilities. Maybe ""BLAST""? But that has A, which is excluded. No. ""BLACK"" has A. No. ""BLOOM"" has O and M. Wait, but the secret word can have O. So maybe ""BLOOM"" is possible. But the first letter is B, and the rest letters are O, L, O, M. But the secret word can't have A, E, R, V. So that's allowed. But the feedback from the first guess doesn't indicate anything about O, L, M. So maybe the secret word is BLOOM. But how to choose between possible options.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""BONDS"". Let's think. Let me try to pick a word that's common and starts with B, and doesn't have A, E, R, V. So BROWN, BONDS, BOLTS, BOLTS. Let me think of ""BOLTS"". B-O-L-T-S. That's a valid word. So maybe that's a good guess. Alternatively, ""BONDS"" or ""BROWN"".

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""BUTTS"". B-U-T-T-S. That's a valid word. But I need to make sure that the letters in the guess don't include any of the excluded letters. So the guess should be a 5-letter word starting with B, and not containing A, E, R, V. So ""BUTTS"" is allowed. So maybe that's a good guess.

Alternatively, ""BAGEL"" is invalid because it has A. ""BONDS"" is valid. So perhaps the next guess is BONDS. Let me check. If the secret word is BONDS, then the feedback for BONDS would be B(✓) and then O, N, D, S. But since the secret word is BONDS, the letters O, N, D, S would be in the correct positions? Wait, no. The secret word is BONDS, so the letters are B, O, N, D, S. So if I guess BONDS, then the feedback would be B(✓), O(✓), N(✓), D(✓), S(✓). But if the secret word is something else, like BROWN, then the feedback would be B(✓), O(✓), W(✓), R(✗), N(✓). Wait, but the first guess was BRAVE, and the secret word doesn't have R, A, V, E. So the secret word can have O, W, N, etc.

So the next guess should be a word that starts with B and doesn't include A, E, R, V. Let's pick BONDS as the second guess. Let's say the secret word is BONDS. Then the feedback would be all correct. But if it's BROWN, then the feedback would be B(✓), O(✓), W(✓), R(x), N(✓). Wait, but R is excluded. So the secret word can't have R. So if the secret word is BROWN, then the letters are B, R, O, W, N. But R is excluded, so that's not possible. Wait, the secret word can't have R, because in the first guess, R was marked as x. So the secret word can't have R. Therefore, BROWN is invalid because it has R. So the secret word can't have R. Therefore, the secret word can't have R, A, E, V. So the secret word is B followed by letters that are not A, E, R, V.

So possible words: BROWN is invalid because of R. So the secret word can't have R. So possible words: BONDS, BOLTS, BAGEL (invalid due to A), BROWN (invalid due to R), BUTTS, BONDS, BONDS, BOLTS, BONDS, etc.

So the next guess could be BONDS. Let's try that. If the secret word is BONDS, then the feedback would be all correct. If it's BOLTS, then the feedback would be B(✓), O(✓), L(✓), T(✓), S(✓). But if the secret word is something else, like BAGEL, but that has A, which is excluded. So no. So the next guess is BONDS. Alternatively, maybe BOLTS. Let me think. Let's pick BONDS as the second guess.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""BONDS"". Let's think. Let me try to pick a word that's common and starts with B, and doesn't have A, E, R, V. So BROWN, BONDS, BOLTS, BOLTS. Let me think of ""BOLTS"". B-O-L-T-S. That's a valid word. So maybe that's a good guess. Alternatively, ""BONDS"" or ""BROWN"".

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""BUTTS"". B-U-T-T-S. That's a valid word. But I need to make sure that the letters in the guess don't include any of the excluded letters. So the guess should be a 5-letter word starting with B, and not containing A, E, R, V. So ""BUTTS"" is allowed. So maybe that's a good guess.

Alternatively, ""BAGEL"" is invalid because it has A. ""BONDS"" is valid. So perhaps the next guess is BONDS. Let me check. If the secret word is BONDS, then the feedback for BONDS would be B(✓) and then O, N, D, S. But since the secret word is BONDS, the letters O, N, D, S would be in the correct positions? Wait, no. The secret word is BONDS, so the letters are B, O, N, D, S. So if I guess BONDS, then the feedback would be B(✓), O(✓), N(✓), D(✓), S(✓). But if the secret word is something else, like BROWN, then the feedback would be B(✓), O(✓), W(✓), R(✗), N(✓). Wait, but the first guess was BRAVE, and the secret word doesn't have R, A, V, E. So the secret word can have O, W, N, etc.

So the next guess should be a word that starts with B and doesn't include A, E, R, V. Let's pick BONDS as the second guess. Let's say the secret word is BONDS. Then the feedback would be all correct. But if it's BROWN, then the feedback would be B(✓), O(✓), W(✓), R(x), N(✓). Wait, but R is excluded. So the secret word can't have R. So if the secret word is BROWN, then the letters are B, R, O, W, N. But R is excluded, so that's not possible. Wait, the secret word can't have R, because in the first guess, R was marked as x. So the secret word can't have R. Therefore, BROWN is invalid because it has R. So the secret word can't have R. Therefore, the secret word can't have R, A, E, V. So the secret word is B followed by letters that are not A, E, R, V.

So possible words: BROWN is invalid because of R. So the secret word can't have R. So possible words: BONDS, BOLTS, BAGEL (invalid due to A), BROWN (invalid due to R), BUTTS, BONDS, BONDS, BOLTS, BONDS, etc.

So the next guess could be BONDS. Let's try that. If the secret word is BONDS, then the feedback would be all correct. If it's BOLTS, then the feedback would be B(✓), O(✓), L(✓), T(✓), S(✓). But if the secret word is something else, like BAGEL, but that has A, which is excluded. So no. So the next guess is BONDS. Alternatively, maybe BOLTS. Let me think. Let's pick BONDS as the second guess.

Okay, let's see. The first guess was BRAVE, and the feedback was B(✓), meaning the first letter is correct. The other letters R, A, V, E are not in the word. Then the second guess was BONDS, and the feedback was B(✓), but the other letters O, N, D, S are all x, meaning they're not in the word. So now I know that the secret word starts with B, and the other letters are not R, A, V, E, O, N, D, or S. So the secret word starts with B, and the remaining letters must be from the letters not in the first guess (excluding R, A, V, E) and not in the second guess (excluding O, N, D, S). So the allowed letters for positions 2-5 are letters that are not in {A, E, R, V, O, N, D, S}. Let's list the possible letters.

Letters in the English alphabet are 26 letters. Excluding A, E, R, V, O, N, D, S. So the remaining letters are B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z. But since the secret word is 5 letters and starts with B, the other letters can't be B again? Wait, no, the secret word can have B in other positions? Wait, the first letter is B, but the other letters could include B again? Wait, but the first guess was BRAVE, which had B in the first position. The feedback for the first guess only indicated that B was correct. So the secret word could have B in other positions as well. But the second guess was BONDS, which had B in the first position, and the feedback for the second guess showed that the other letters (O, N, D, S) were not in the word. So the secret word can't have O, N, D, S. So the remaining letters for positions 2-5 are letters not in {A, E, R, V, O, N, D, S}. So possible letters for positions 2-5: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z. But the secret word is 5 letters, starting with B. So the second letter could be any of those letters, but the third, fourth, fifth letters as well.

So possible words could be B followed by letters from that list. Let's think of possible 5-letter words starting with B and not containing A, E, R, V, O, N, D, S. Let's try to think of such words. For example:

- BCGHI? No, that's not a word.
- BILLY? But that has L, I, Y. Wait, BILLY is 5 letters. Let's check: B-I-L-L-Y. But the letters I, L, Y are allowed. But the secret word can't have O, N, D, S, etc. So BILLY is allowed. But is that a valid word? Yes, BILLY is a name, but maybe the secret word is a common noun. Alternatively, maybe ""BILLY"" is possible. But maybe there's a better word.

Another possibility: ""BILLY"" is a valid word. Alternatively, ""BUTTS"" is invalid because it has T and S, but S is excluded. Wait, S is excluded because in the second guess, S was marked as x. So S can't be in the secret word. So ""BUTTS"" is invalid. How about ""BILLY""? Let's check. The letters in BILLY are B, I, L, L, Y. None of the excluded letters (A, E, R, V, O, N, D, S) are present. So that's allowed. So BILLY is a possible guess. But is there another word?

Alternatively, ""BILGE"" is a word, but it has E, which is excluded. No. ""BILLY"" is possible. Another option: ""BILLY"" or ""BILLY"". Alternatively, ""BILLY"" is the only one that comes to mind. Alternatively, ""BILLY"" might be the secret word. But maybe there's another word. Let's think of ""BILLY"" or ""BILLY"".

Alternatively, ""BILLY"" is a good guess. Let's try that. So the third guess is BILLY. If the secret word is BILLY, then the feedback would be B(✓), I(✓), L(✓), L(✓), Y(✓). But if the secret word is different, say, ""BLAST"" but that has A, which is excluded. So no. Alternatively, maybe ""BILLY"" is the correct word. So I'll go with BILLY as the third guess.

Wait, but maybe there's another word. Let's think again. What about ""BILLY""? Yes. Alternatively, ""BILLY"" is a valid word. So I think that's the best guess here. So the third guess is BILLY.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: BRAVE -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) R(x) A(x) V(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Okay, let's see. The first guess was BRAVE, and the feedback was B(✓), which means the letter B is in the correct position. The other letters R, A, V, E are not in the word. So the secret word has B in the first position. Wait, no, the feedback says B(✓), so that means the B is in the correct position. So the first letter is B. The other letters in BRAVE (R, A, V, E) are not in the word. So the secret word starts with B, and the other letters are not R, A, V, or E.

So now, I need to think of a 5-letter word starting with B, and not containing R, A, V, or E. Let's think. Possible letters for the other positions. Let's consider possible words. Let's think of words starting with B, and without R, A, V, E. So letters allowed in the other positions could be C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Y, Z. But the secret word is a 5-letter English word.

So possible words: B... Let's think. Maybe ""BROWN""? Wait, but that has an O and W, but the secret word might have those. Wait, but the feedback for the first guess didn't indicate any of those letters. Wait, the first guess was BRAVE, and the feedback was B(✓) and the rest x. So the secret word does not have R, A, V, or E. So the secret word can't have those letters. So the other letters in the secret word must be from the remaining letters. So, for example, if the secret word is BROWN, but that has O and W, which are allowed. But wait, the first guess was BRAVE, and the secret word doesn't have A, E, R, V. So the secret word can have O, W, etc. So possible words starting with B, and not containing A, E, R, V.

So possible words: BROWN, BUTTS, BAGEL (but that has A, which is excluded), BONDS, BONSAI (too long), BONDS, BOLTS, BONDS, BONDS. Wait, BONDS is 5 letters. B-O-N-D-S. Let me check if that's valid. Yes, BONDS is a valid word. But the secret word could be BONDS. Alternatively, BROWN. Let's think of other possibilities. Maybe ""BLAST""? But that has A, which is excluded. No. ""BLACK"" has A. No. ""BLOOM"" has O and M. Wait, but the secret word can have O. So maybe ""BLOOM"" is possible. But the first letter is B, and the rest letters are O, L, O, M. But the secret word can't have A, E, R, V. So that's allowed. But the feedback from the first guess doesn't indicate anything about O, L, M. So maybe the secret word is BLOOM. But how to choose between possible options.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""BONDS"". Let's think. Let me try to pick a word that's common and starts with B, and doesn't have A, E, R, V. So BROWN, BONDS, BOLTS, BOLTS. Let me think of ""BOLTS"". B-O-L-T-S. That's a valid word. So maybe that's a good guess. Alternatively, ""BONDS"" or ""BROWN"".

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""BUTTS"". B-U-T-T-S. That's a valid word. But I need to make sure that the letters in the guess don't include any of the excluded letters. So the guess should be a 5-letter word starting with B, and not containing A, E, R, V. So ""BUTTS"" is allowed. So maybe that's a good guess.

Alternatively, ""BAGEL"" is invalid because it has A. ""BONDS"" is valid. So perhaps the next guess is BONDS. Let me check. If the secret word is BONDS, then the feedback for BONDS would be B(✓) and then O, N, D, S. But since the secret word is BONDS, the letters O, N, D, S would be in the correct positions? Wait, no. The secret word is BONDS, so the letters are B, O, N, D, S. So if I guess BONDS, then the feedback would be B(✓), O(✓), N(✓), D(✓), S(✓). But if the secret word is something else, like BROWN, then the feedback would be B(✓), O(✓), W(✓), R(✗), N(✓). Wait, but the first guess was BRAVE, and the secret word doesn't have R, A, V, E. So the secret word can have O, W, N, etc.

So the next guess should be a word that starts with B and doesn't include A, E, R, V. Let's pick BONDS as the second guess. Let's say the secret word is BONDS. Then the feedback would be all correct. But if it's BROWN, then the feedback would be B(✓), O(✓), W(✓), R(x), N(✓). Wait, but R is excluded. So the secret word can't have R. So if the secret word is BROWN, then the letters are B, R, O, W, N. But R is excluded, so that's not possible. Wait, the secret word can't have R, because in the first guess, R was marked as x. So the secret word can't have R. Therefore, BROWN is invalid because it has R. So the secret word can't have R. Therefore, the secret word can't have R, A, E, V. So the secret word is B followed by letters that are not A, E, R, V.

So possible words: BROWN is invalid because of R. So the secret word can't have R. So possible words: BONDS, BOLTS, BAGEL (invalid due to A), BROWN (invalid due to R), BUTTS, BONDS, BONDS, BOLTS, BONDS, etc.

So the next guess could be BONDS. Let's try that. If the secret word is BONDS, then the feedback would be all correct. If it's BOLTS, then the feedback would be B(✓), O(✓), L(✓), T(✓), S(✓). But if the secret word is something else, like BAGEL, but that has A, which is excluded. So no. So the next guess is BONDS. Alternatively, maybe BOLTS. Let me think. Let's pick BONDS as the second guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Okay, let's see. The first guess was BRAVE, and the feedback was B(✓), meaning the first letter is correct. The other letters R, A, V, E are not in the word. Then the second guess was BONDS, and the feedback was B(✓), but the other letters O, N, D, S are all x, meaning they're not in the word. So now I know that the secret word starts with B, and the other letters are not R, A, V, E, O, N, D, or S. So the secret word starts with B, and the remaining letters must be from the letters not in the first guess (excluding R, A, V, E) and not in the second guess (excluding O, N, D, S). So the allowed letters for positions 2-5 are letters that are not in {A, E, R, V, O, N, D, S}. Let's list the possible letters.

Letters in the English alphabet are 26 letters. Excluding A, E, R, V, O, N, D, S. So the remaining letters are B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z. But since the secret word is 5 letters and starts with B, the other letters can't be B again? Wait, no, the secret word can have B in other positions? Wait, the first letter is B, but the other letters could include B again? Wait, but the first guess was BRAVE, which had B in the first position. The feedback for the first guess only indicated that B was correct. So the secret word could have B in other positions as well. But the second guess was BONDS, which had B in the first position, and the feedback for the second guess showed that the other letters (O, N, D, S) were not in the word. So the secret word can't have O, N, D, S. So the remaining letters for positions 2-5 are letters not in {A, E, R, V, O, N, D, S}. So possible letters for positions 2-5: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z. But the secret word is 5 letters, starting with B. So the second letter could be any of those letters, but the third, fourth, fifth letters as well.

So possible words could be B followed by letters from that list. Let's think of possible 5-letter words starting with B and not containing A, E, R, V, O, N, D, S. Let's try to think of such words. For example:

- BCGHI? No, that's not a word.
- BILLY? But that has L, I, Y. Wait, BILLY is 5 letters. Let's check: B-I-L-L-Y. But the letters I, L, Y are allowed. But the secret word can't have O, N, D, S, etc. So BILLY is allowed. But is that a valid word? Yes, BILLY is a name, but maybe the secret word is a common noun. Alternatively, maybe ""BILLY"" is possible. But maybe there's a better word.

Another possibility: ""BILLY"" is a valid word. Alternatively, ""BUTTS"" is invalid because it has T and S, but S is excluded. Wait, S is excluded because in the second guess, S was marked as x. So S can't be in the secret word. So ""BUTTS"" is invalid. How about ""BILLY""? Let's check. The letters in BILLY are B, I, L, L, Y. None of the excluded letters (A, E, R, V, O, N, D, S) are present. So that's allowed. So BILLY is a possible guess. But is there another word?

Alternatively, ""BILGE"" is a word, but it has E, which is excluded. No. ""BILLY"" is possible. Another option: ""BILLY"" or ""BILLY"". Alternatively, ""BILLY"" is the only one that comes to mind. Alternatively, ""BILLY"" might be the secret word. But maybe there's another word. Let's think of ""BILLY"" or ""BILLY"".

Alternatively, ""BILLY"" is a good guess. Let's try that. So the third guess is BILLY. If the secret word is BILLY, then the feedback would be B(✓), I(✓), L(✓), L(✓), Y(✓). But if the secret word is different, say, ""BLAST"" but that has A, which is excluded. So no. Alternatively, maybe ""BILLY"" is the correct word. So I'll go with BILLY as the third guess.

Wait, but maybe there's another word. Let's think again. What about ""BILLY""? Yes. Alternatively, ""BILLY"" is a valid word. So I think that's the best guess here. So the third guess is BILLY.

The other letters in BRAVE (R, A, V, E) are not in the word. So the secret word starts with B, and the other letters are not R, A, V, or E.\n\nSo now, I need to think of a 5-letter word starting with B, and not containing R, A, V, or E. Let\'s think. Possible letters for the other positions. Let\'s consider possible words. Let\'s think of words starting with B, and without R, A, V, E.

So the secret word can have O, W, etc. So possible words starting with B, and not containing A, E, R, V.\n\nSo possible words: BROWN, BUTTS, BAGEL (but that has A, which is excluded), BONDS, BONSAI (too long), BONDS, BOLTS, BONDS, BONDS.

But how to choose between possible options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the secret word is ""BONDS"". Let\'s think. Let me try to pick a word that\'s common and starts with B, and doesn\'t have A, E, R, V. So BROWN, BONDS, BOLTS, BOLTS. Let me think of ""BOLTS"". B-O-L-T-S. That\'s a valid word.

The secret word is BONDS, so the letters are B, O, N, D, S. So if I guess BONDS, then the feedback would be B(✓), O(✓), N(✓), D(✓), S(✓). But if the secret word is something else, like BROWN, then the feedback would be B(✓), O(✓), W(✓), R(✗), N(✓). Wait, but the first guess was BRAVE, and the secret word doesn\'t have R, A, V, E.

Okay, let's see. The user has given me three guesses so far with their feedback. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the secret word is a 5-letter word. The first guess was BRAVE, and the feedback was B(✓), meaning the first letter is correct. The other letters R, A, V, E are not in the word. So the secret word starts with B and doesn't have R, A, V, or E.

The second guess was BONDS, which gave feedback B(✓) and the rest O, N, D, S all x. So the secret word starts with B, and the letters O, N, D, S are not in the word. So now, the secret word can't have R, A, V, E, O, N, D, S. So the remaining letters allowed for positions 2-5 are letters not in {A, E, R, V, O, N, D, S}. That leaves letters like B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Third guess was BILLY, with feedback B(✓), I(x), L(✓), L(✓), Y(✓). Wait, that's confusing. The feedback for BILLY shows B(✓), which is correct. Then I(x) means I is not in the word. But L(✓) and Y(✓) mean that L and Y are in the word. Wait, but the third guess is BILLY. Let me check the feedback again. The user says: B(✓) I(x) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓). So the letters in BILLY are B, I, L, L, Y. The feedback says B is correct, I is not, but L and Y are correct. Wait, that's conflicting. Because if the secret word has L and Y, but the third guess is BILLY, then the L's and Y are in the word. But the feedback says I is not in the word. So the secret word has B, L, Y, and maybe another L? But the secret word is 5 letters. Wait, maybe the secret word is B_L_L_Y? But the third guess is BILLY, which has I in the second position. The feedback says I is not in the word, so the secret word doesn't have I. But the third guess has two L's and a Y. The feedback shows that L and Y are correct. So the secret word must have L and Y, but not I. So the secret word starts with B, has L and Y in positions 3 and 5, maybe? Let me think.

So from the third guess, we know that B is correct (position 1), L is correct (positions 3 or 4?), and Y is correct (position 5). But the feedback for the third guess is B(✓) I(x) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓). Wait, that's a bit confusing. The third guess is BILLY, which is B-I-L-L-Y. The feedback for each letter is:

B: ✓ (correct position)
I: x (not in the word)
L: ✓ (correct position)
L: ✓ (correct position)
Y: ✓ (correct position)

Wait, that would mean that the secret word has B in position 1, L in positions 3 and 4, and Y in position 5. But that's impossible because the secret word is 5 letters. Let me check again. The third guess is BILLY. The letters are B (1), I (2), L (3), L (4), Y (5). The feedback says:

- B is correct (position 1)
- I is not in the word
- L is correct (so at least one L is in the word)
- L is correct again (so another L)
- Y is correct (position 5)

So the secret word has B in position 1, Y in position 5, and at least two L's. But since the secret word is 5 letters, maybe the L's are in positions 3 and 4. So the secret word could be B_L_L_Y. But the second letter is not I, so maybe it's B followed by some other letter, then two L's, then Y. But the second letter can't be I. So the secret word is B _ L L Y. The second letter must be a letter that's not in the excluded set (A, E, R, V, O, N, D, S, I). Wait, because the third guess's I is not in the word, so the secret word doesn't have I. So the second letter can't be I. So the second letter must be from the allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z. But the secret word is B _ L L Y. So the second letter is one of those letters. Let's think of possible words. For example, ""BULLY"" is a word. B-U-L-L-Y. But the second letter is U, which is allowed. But the secret word would be BULLY. Let me check if that's possible. The letters in BULLY are B, U, L, L, Y. The excluded letters are A, E, R, V, O, N, D, S, I. So U is allowed. So BULLY is a valid word. But the third guess was BILLY, which has I in the second position, which is not in the secret word. So the secret word can't have I, but can have U. So BULLY would be a possible secret word. Let's check the feedback for BULLY. If the secret word is BULLY, then the third guess BILLY would have:

B (correct), I (not in the word), L (correct), L (correct), Y (correct). So the feedback would be B(✓) I(x) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓). Which matches the user's feedback. So that makes sense. Therefore, the secret word is BULLY. But wait, the user hasn't given the feedback for the third guess yet. Wait, the user provided the feedback for the third guess as B(✓) I(x) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓). So that's correct. So the secret word is BULLY. Therefore, the next guess would be BULLY. But the user hasn't guessed that yet. Wait, but the user is asking for the next guess. So after the third guess, the feedback indicates that the secret word has B, L, L, Y. So the next guess should be BULLY. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, BULLY is a 5-letter word. So the fourth guess would be BULLY. But wait, the user has three guesses so far. The user is allowed six tries. So the next guess is the fourth one. So the fourth guess would be BULLY. Let me check if that's correct. If the secret word is BULLY, then the feedback would be all correct. But if it's a different word, like BALLY (but that has A, which is excluded), so no. Or BALLY is invalid. So BULLY is the best guess here. Therefore, the fourth guess is BULLY.

First, the secret word is a 5-letter word. The first guess was BRAVE, and the feedback was B(✓), meaning the first letter is correct. The other letters R, A, V, E are not in the word. So the secret word starts with B and doesn't have R, A, V, or E.

The second guess was BONDS, which gave feedback B(✓) and the rest O, N, D, S all x. So the secret word starts with B, and the letters O, N, D, S are not in the word. So now, the secret word can't have R, A, V, E, O, N, D, S. So the remaining letters allowed for positions 2-5 are letters not in {A, E, R, V, O, N, D, S}. That leaves letters like B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Third guess was BILLY, with feedback B(✓), I(x), L(✓), L(✓), Y(✓). Wait, that's confusing. The feedback for BILLY shows B(✓), which is correct. Then I(x) means I is not in the word. But L(✓) and Y(✓) mean that L and Y are in the word. Wait, but the third guess is BILLY. Let me check the feedback again. The user says: B(✓) I(x) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓). So the letters in BILLY are B, I, L, L, Y. The feedback says B is correct, I is not, but L and Y are correct. Wait, that's conflicting. Because if the secret word has L and Y, but the third guess is BILLY, then the L's and Y are in the word. But the feedback says I is not in the word. So the secret word has B, L, Y, and maybe another L? But the secret word is 5 letters. Wait, maybe the secret word is B_L_L_Y? But the third guess is BILLY, which has I in the second position. The feedback says I is not in the word, so the secret word doesn't have I. But the third guess has two L's and a Y. The feedback shows that L and Y are correct. So the secret word must have L and Y, but not I. So the secret word starts with B, has L and Y in positions 3 and 5, maybe? Let me think.

So from the third guess, we know that B is correct (position 1), L is correct (positions 3 or 4?), and Y is correct (position 5). But the feedback for the third guess is B(✓) I(x) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓). Wait, that's a bit confusing. The third guess is BILLY, which is B-I-L-L-Y. The feedback for each letter is:

B: ✓ (correct position)
I: x (not in the word)
L: ✓ (correct position)
L: ✓ (correct position)
Y: ✓ (correct position)

Wait, that would mean that the secret word has B in position 1, L in positions 3 and 4, and Y in position 5. But that's impossible because the secret word is 5 letters. Let me check again. The third guess is BILLY. The letters are B (1), I (2), L (3), L (4), Y (5). The feedback says:

- B is correct (position 1)
- I is not in the word
- L is correct (so at least one L is in the word)
- L is correct again (so another L)
- Y is correct (position 5)

So the secret word has B in position 1, Y in position 5, and at least two L's. But since the secret word is 5 letters, maybe the L's are in positions 3 and 4. So the secret word could be B_L_L_Y. But the second letter is not I, so maybe it's B followed by some other letter, then two L's, then Y. But the second letter can't be I. So the secret word is B _ L L Y. The second letter must be a letter that's not in the excluded set (A, E, R, V, O, N, D, S, I). Wait, because the third guess's I is not in the word, so the secret word doesn't have I. So the second letter can't be I. So the second letter must be from the allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z. But the secret word is B _ L L Y. So the second letter is one of those letters. Let's think of possible words. For example, ""BULLY"" is a word. B-U-L-L-Y. But the second letter is U, which is allowed. But the secret word would be BULLY. Let me check if that's possible. The letters in BULLY are B, U, L, L, Y. The excluded letters are A, E, R, V, O, N, D, S, I. So U is allowed. So BULLY is a valid word. But the third guess was BILLY, which has I in the second position, which is not in the secret word. So the secret word can't have I, but can have U. So BULLY would be a possible secret word. Let's check the feedback for BULLY. If the secret word is BULLY, then the third guess BILLY would have:

B (correct), I (not in the word), L (correct), L (correct), Y (correct). So the feedback would be B(✓) I(x) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓). Which matches the user's feedback. So that makes sense. Therefore, the secret word is BULLY. But wait, the user hasn't given the feedback for the third guess yet. Wait, the user provided the feedback for the third guess as B(✓) I(x) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓). So that's correct. So the secret word is BULLY. Therefore, the next guess would be BULLY. But the user hasn't guessed that yet. Wait, but the user is asking for the next guess. So after the third guess, the feedback indicates that the secret word has B, L, L, Y. So the next guess should be BULLY. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, BULLY is a 5-letter word. So the fourth guess would be BULLY. But wait, the user has three guesses so far. The user is allowed six tries. So the next guess is the fourth one. So the fourth guess would be BULLY. Let me check if that's correct. If the secret word is BULLY, then the feedback would be all correct. But if it's a different word, like BALLY (but that has A, which is excluded), so no. Or BALLY is invalid. So BULLY is the best guess here. Therefore, the fourth guess is BULLY.",Guess 4: BULLY -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) U(✓) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
