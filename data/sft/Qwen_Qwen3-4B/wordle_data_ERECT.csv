Okay, I need to guess a 5-letter word. Let me think. Since I don't have any feedback yet, I should pick a common word that has a good chance of being the secret word. Maybe something like ""CRANE"" or ""TRUST""? Wait, but I should consider that the feedback will help me narrow down. Let me go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess. It's a common word and has letters that might be useful. If the feedback comes back, I can adjust based on the symbols. Let's see... If any letters are correct, that gives me a clue. But since I don't have any info yet, just picking a common word makes sense. Alright, I'll go with CRANE.

Okay, let's see. The first guess was CRANE, and the feedback was C(-), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(-). So that means the letter R is in the correct position (second letter), but the other letters C, A, N, E are not in the word or in the wrong positions. Wait, no—the feedback symbols are for each letter. So C is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's a -), R is correct (✓), A is not in the word (x), N is not in the word (x), E is in the word but wrong position (since it's a -). Wait, no—wait the feedback for each letter is:

C(-): So C is in the word but in the wrong position.

R(✓): R is correct.

A(x): A is not in the word.

N(x): N is not in the word.

E(-): E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So the secret word has R in the second position. Also, it has E somewhere else, but not in the fifth position (since E was in the fifth position in the guess and got a -). Also, C is present but not in the first position. So the secret word has R as the second letter, and E somewhere else. Also, the letters A and N are not in the word.

So possible letters: The secret word has R in position 2. So the word is _ R _ _ _. Also, E is present but not in position 5. So E could be in position 1, 3, or 4. Also, C is in the word but not in position 1. So C could be in position 3, 4, or 5. But wait, the feedback for E was -, meaning E is in the word but in the wrong position. Since in the first guess, E was in position 5, so the secret word's E is not in position 5. So E is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. But position 2 is R, so E is in 1, 3, or 4.

So possible letters: The word has R in position 2. Also, E is present. Also, C is present but not in position 1. So maybe the word has C in position 3, 4, or 5. Let's think of possible words.

Possible words: Let's think of 5-letter words with R in the second position. For example, ""BRAVE"" but that has A which is excluded. Wait, the first guess had A, which was x, so A is not in the word. So the secret word doesn't have A or N. So letters allowed: The secret word has R, E, and C (since C is in the word but not in position 1). Also, other letters? Let's think.

So possible letters: The secret word has R, E, C. Also, maybe other letters. But since the first guess had C, which is in the word but not in position 1, so C is in the word. So the secret word has C, R, E. Let's think of words that fit.

Possible words: Let's think of words with R in position 2. For example:

- ""CREST"": C R E S T. But that has S and T. But we don't know if those letters are in the word. However, the secret word could have those letters. But we need to check if the letters are allowed. Wait, the secret word has R, E, and C. So maybe ""CREST"" is possible. But let's check the feedback for the first guess. The first guess was CRANE, which had C, R, A, N, E. The feedback said A and N are not in the word. So the secret word doesn't have A or N. So ""CREST"" would have C, R, E, S, T. But S and T are not in the first guess's feedback, so they could be in the secret word. However, the secret word could have other letters. But since we have to guess a 5-letter word, maybe ""CREST"" is a possibility. But let's think of other possibilities.

Another possibility: ""CREAM"" but that has A, which is excluded. So no. ""CREST"" is possible. Alternatively, ""CRANE"" was the first guess, but that had A and N, which are excluded. So the secret word can't have A or N. So maybe ""CRIME""? But that has I and M. But the secret word could have those. Wait, but the secret word has R in position 2. Let's think of words with R in position 2 and E and C. For example, ""CREST"" (C R E S T), ""CREAM"" (but A is excluded), ""CRESS"" (but that has two S's). Alternatively, ""CRESS"" is not valid because it has two S's. Wait, but the secret word is 5 letters. Let me think of other words.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRATE"". But that has A, which is excluded. So no. ""CRATE"" is out. How about ""CRANE"" was the first guess, but that had A and N. So no. So maybe ""CREST"" is possible. But let's think of other options. Let's think of words with R in position 2, E in position 3 or 4, and C in position 1, 3, or 4. Wait, the first guess had C in position 1, but the feedback said C is in the word but in the wrong position. So C is not in position 1. So C must be in position 3, 4, or 5. So possible words:

- C R E S T (CREST)
- C R E A T (CREAT) but A is excluded.
- C R E D E (CREDE) but that's not a word.
- C R E W S (CREWS) but that has W and S. But the secret word could have those letters. But we need to check if the letters are allowed. Since the first guess had E in position 5, which was a -, so E is in the word but not in position 5. So E could be in position 1, 3, or 4. Let's think of ""CREWS"" (C R E W S). That has E in position 3. So that's possible. But is ""CREWS"" a valid word? Yes. Alternatively, ""CREST"" is also valid.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRANE"" but that's excluded because A and N are not in the word. So no. So possible options are CREST, CREWS, etc. But how to choose?

Alternatively, maybe the secret word has E in position 1. For example, ""ERECT"". Let's check: E R E C T. But that has E in position 1 and 3. But the secret word has R in position 2. So that's possible. But the first guess had E in position 5, which was a -, so E is in the word but not in position 5. So E could be in position 1, 3, or 4. So ""ERECT"" would have E in 1 and 3. But the secret word could be that. However, the first guess had C in position 1, which was a -, so C is in the word but not in position 1. So in ""ERECT"", C is in position 4. That's allowed. So ""ERECT"" is a possibility.

But I need to make a guess. Let's think of possible words that fit the criteria. Since the secret word has R in position 2, and E somewhere else, and C in another position. Let's think of ""CREST"" as a possible guess. Alternatively, ""CREAM"" is invalid because of A. So maybe ""CREST"" is a good choice. Let me check if ""CREST"" is a valid word. Yes, it is. So I'll go with CREST as the second guess. But wait, the feedback from the first guess said that E is in the word but in the wrong position. In CREST, E is in position 3. The first guess had E in position 5, so that's a different position, so that's acceptable. Also, C is in position 1 in the first guess, but the secret word's C is in position 1? Wait no, the feedback said that C is in the word but in the wrong position. So in the first guess, C was in position 1, but the secret word's C is not in position 1. So in CREST, C is in position 1. That would mean that the secret word has C in position 1, but the feedback said that C is in the word but in the wrong position. Wait, that's a contradiction. Because if the secret word had C in position 1, then in the first guess, C was in position 1, which would be a ✓, but the feedback said C(-). So that's not possible. Therefore, C cannot be in position 1. Therefore, in the second guess, C can't be in position 1. So ""CREST"" would have C in position 1, which would be wrong. Therefore, that's invalid. So I need to choose a word where C is not in position 1.

So, let's think again. The secret word has R in position 2. C is in the word but not in position 1. So C must be in position 3, 4, or 5. Also, E is in the word but not in position 5. So possible words:

- ""CRESS"" (but has two S's, maybe not valid)
- ""CREST"" (but C is in position 1, which is not allowed)
- ""CREAM"" (invalid due to A)
- ""CREED"" (but that has D and E in position 3 and 5. Wait, but E can't be in position 5. So ""CREED"" has E in position 5, which would be invalid. So no.
- ""CRIES"" (C R I E S). But that has I and S. But the secret word could have those letters. However, the secret word has E in position 4. But the first guess had E in position 5, which is a -, so E is in the word but not in 5. So E could be in 4. So ""CRIES"" would have E in position 4. That's acceptable. Also, C is in position 1, which is not allowed. So that's invalid. So that's no good.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let's think of other words. Maybe ""CROON"" but that has O and N. N is excluded. So no. ""CROAK"" has A, which is excluded. ""CROWN"" has O and W, but N is excluded. ""CROWN"" has N in position 5, which is excluded. So no. ""CROPS"" has O and S. But that's possible. But the secret word has R in position 2. So C R O P S. But that would have O and P. But the secret word could have those letters. However, the first guess had E in position 5, which was a -, so E is in the word but not in position 5. So E is in the word, but in this case, the word is CROPS, which doesn't have E. So that's not possible. So that's invalid.

Wait, the secret word must have E. Because in the first guess, E was in position 5, and the feedback was -, meaning E is in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word must have E. So the word must have E. So ""CROPS"" is out. So back to the drawing board.

So the secret word has R in position 2, E in position 1, 3, or 4, and C in position 3, 4, or 5. Let's think of words where C is not in position 1. For example, ""ERECT"" (E R E C T). But that has E in position 1 and 3. C is in position 4. That's allowed. So E is in position 1, which is different from the first guess's position 5, so that's okay. So ""ERECT"" is a possibility. Let's check: E R E C T. That's 5 letters. Yes. So that's a valid word. So that could be the secret word. Alternatively, ""ERECT"" is a good candidate. Let's try that. So the second guess would be ""ERECT"". Let's see if that works.

But wait, the secret word could also be ""CREST"" but with C in position 3. Wait, no. Because in ""CREST"", C is in position 1. Which is not allowed. So that's invalid. So ""ERECT"" is a better choice. So I'll go with ""ERECT"" as the second guess. But I need to check if that's a valid word. Yes, ERECT is a valid 5-letter word. So that's my next guess.

<guess>ERECT</guess>",ERECT,"Okay, let's see. The first guess was CRANE, and the feedback was C(-), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(-). So that means the letter R is in the correct position (second letter), but the other letters C, A, N, E are not in the word or in the wrong positions. Wait, no—the feedback symbols are for each letter. So C is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's a -), R is correct (✓), A is not in the word (x), N is not in the word (x), E is in the word but wrong position (since it's a -). Wait, no—wait the feedback for each letter is:

C(-): So C is in the word but in the wrong position.

R(✓): R is correct.

A(x): A is not in the word.

N(x): N is not in the word.

E(-): E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So the secret word has R in the second position. Also, it has E somewhere else, but not in the fifth position (since E was in the fifth position in the guess and got a -). Also, C is present but not in the first position. So the secret word has R as the second letter, and E somewhere else. Also, the letters A and N are not in the word.

So possible letters: The secret word has R in position 2. So the word is _ R _ _ _. Also, E is present but not in position 5. So E could be in position 1, 3, or 4. Also, C is in the word but not in position 1. So C could be in position 3, 4, or 5. But wait, the feedback for E was -, meaning E is in the word but in the wrong position. Since in the first guess, E was in position 5, so the secret word's E is not in position 5. So E is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. But position 2 is R, so E is in 1, 3, or 4.

So possible letters: The word has R in position 2. Also, E is present. Also, C is present but not in position 1. So maybe the word has C in position 3, 4, or 5. Let's think of possible words.

Possible words: Let's think of 5-letter words with R in the second position. For example, ""BRAVE"" but that has A which is excluded. Wait, the first guess had A, which was x, so A is not in the word. So the secret word doesn't have A or N. So letters allowed: The secret word has R, E, and C (since C is in the word but not in position 1). Also, other letters? Let's think.

So possible letters: The secret word has R, E, C. Also, maybe other letters. But since the first guess had C, which is in the word but not in position 1, so C is in the word. So the secret word has C, R, E. Let's think of words that fit.

Possible words: Let's think of words with R in position 2. For example:

- ""CREST"": C R E S T. But that has S and T. But we don't know if those letters are in the word. However, the secret word could have those letters. But we need to check if the letters are allowed. Wait, the secret word has R, E, and C. So maybe ""CREST"" is possible. But let's check the feedback for the first guess. The first guess was CRANE, which had C, R, A, N, E. The feedback said A and N are not in the word. So the secret word doesn't have A or N. So ""CREST"" would have C, R, E, S, T.

But since we have to guess a 5-letter word, maybe ""CREST"" is a possibility. But let's think of other possibilities.

Another possibility: ""CREAM"" but that has A, which is excluded. So no. ""CREST"" is possible. Alternatively, ""CRANE"" was the first guess, but that had A and N, which are excluded. So the secret word can't have A or N. So maybe ""CRIME""? But that has I and M. But the secret word could have those. Wait, but the secret word has R in position 2. Let's think of words with R in position 2 and E and C. For example, ""CREST"" (C R E S T), ""CREAM"" (but A is excluded), ""CRESS"" (but that has two S's). Alternatively, ""CRESS"" is not valid because it has two S's. Wait, but the secret word is 5 letters. Let me think of other words.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRATE"". But that has A, which is excluded. So no. ""CRATE"" is out. How about ""CRANE"" was the first guess, but that had A and N. So no. So maybe ""CREST"" is possible. But let's think of other options. Let's think of words with R in position 2, E in position 3 or 4, and C in position 1, 3, or 4. Wait, the first guess had C in position 1, but the feedback said C is in the word but in the wrong position. So C is not in position 1. So C must be in position 3, 4, or 5. So possible words:

- C R E S T (CREST)
- C R E A T (CREAT) but A is excluded.
- C R E D E (CREDE) but that's not a word.
- C R E W S (CREWS) but that has W and S. But the secret word could have those letters. But we need to check if the letters are allowed. Since the first guess had E in position 5, which was a -, so E is in the word but not in position 5. So E could be in position 1, 3, or 4. Let's think of ""CREWS"" (C R E W S). That has E in position 3. So that's possible. But is ""CREWS"" a valid word? Yes. Alternatively, ""CREST"" is also valid.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRANE"" but that's excluded because A and N are not in the word. So no. So possible options are CREST, CREWS, etc. But how to choose?

Alternatively, maybe the secret word has E in position 1. For example, ""ERECT"". Let's check: E R E C T. But that has E in position 1 and 3. But the secret word has R in position 2. So that's possible. But the first guess had E in position 5, which was a -, so E is in the word but not in position 5. So E could be in position 1, 3, or 4. So ""ERECT"" would have E in 1 and 3. But the secret word could be that. However, the first guess had C in position 1, which was a -, so C is in the word but not in position 1. So in ""ERECT"", C is in position 4. That's allowed. So ""ERECT"" is a possibility.

But I need to make a guess. Let's think of possible words that fit the criteria. Since the secret word has R in position 2, and E somewhere else, and C in another position.

The first guess had E in position 5, so that's a different position, so that's acceptable. Also, C is in position 1 in the first guess, but the secret word's C is in position 1? Wait no, the feedback said that C is in the word but in the wrong position. So in the first guess, C was in position 1, but the secret word's C is not in position 1. So in CREST, C is in position 1. That would mean that the secret word has C in position 1, but the feedback said that C is in the word but in the wrong position. Wait, that's a contradiction. Because if the secret word had C in position 1, then in the first guess, C was in position 1, which would be a ✓, but the feedback said C(-). So that's not possible. Therefore, C cannot be in position 1. Therefore, in the second guess, C can't be in position 1. So ""CREST"" would have C in position 1, which would be wrong. Therefore, that's invalid. So I need to choose a word where C is not in position 1.

So, let's think again. The secret word has R in position 2. C is in the word but not in position 1. So C must be in position 3, 4, or 5. Also, E is in the word but not in position 5. So possible words:

- ""CREST"" (but C is in position 1, which is not allowed)
- ""CREAM"" (invalid due to A)
- ""CREED"" (but that has D and E in position 3 and 5. Wait, but E can't be in position 5. So ""CREED"" has E in position 5, which would be invalid. So no.
- ""CRIES"" (C R I E S). But that has I and S. But the secret word could have those letters. However, the secret word has E in position 4. But the first guess had E in position 5, which is a -, so E is in the word but not in 5. So E could be in 4. So ""CRIES"" would have E in position 4. That's acceptable. Also, C is in position 1, which is not allowed. So that's invalid. So that's no good.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let's think of other words. Maybe ""CROON"" but that has O and N. N is excluded. So no. ""CROAK"" has A, which is excluded. ""CROWN"" has O and W, but N is excluded.

So E is in the word, but in this case, the word is CROPS, which doesn't have E. So that's not possible. So that's invalid.

Wait, the secret word must have E. Because in the first guess, E was in position 5, and the feedback was -, meaning E is in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word must have E. So the word must have E. So ""CROPS"" is out. So back to the drawing board.

So the secret word has R in position 2, E in position 1, 3, or 4, and C in position 3, 4, or 5. Let's think of words where C is not in position 1. For example, ""ERECT"" (E R E C T). But that has E in position 1 and 3. C is in position 4. That's allowed. So E is in position 1, which is different from the first guess's position 5, so that's okay. So ""ERECT"" is a possibility. Let's check: E R E C T. That's 5 letters. Yes. So that's a valid word. So that could be the secret word. Alternatively, ""ERECT"" is a good candidate. Let's try that. So the second guess would be ""ERECT"". Let's see if that works.

But wait, the secret word could also be ""CREST"" but with C in position 3. Wait, no. Because in ""CREST"", C is in position 1. Which is not allowed. So that's invalid. So ""ERECT"" is a better choice. So I'll go with ""ERECT"" as the second guess. But I need to check if that's a valid word. Yes, ERECT is a valid 5-letter word. So that's my next guess.",Guess 2: ERECT -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) R(✓) E(✓) C(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
