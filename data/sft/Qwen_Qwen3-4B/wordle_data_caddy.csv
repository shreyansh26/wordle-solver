Okay, let's see. I need to guess a 5-letter word. The secret word is somewhere in the list of possible 5-letter English words. Since I have six tries, I should start with a word that's common or has letters that might be common in many words. Maybe something like ""CRANE"" or ""BRAVE""? Wait, but I don't have any feedback yet. Let me think of a word that's versatile. Maybe ""STARS""? Or ""CRANE""? Or ""BLANK""? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe ""RADIO""? Wait, but I need to pick a word that's likely to have some letters that could be in the secret word. Let me go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess. It's a common word with letters C, R, A, N, E. If that's the first guess, maybe I can get some feedback. Alternatively, ""BRAVE"" might be good because it has B, R, A, V, E. But I'm not sure. Maybe ""STARS"" is better? Or ""TANKS""? Wait, but I need to pick one. Let me go with ""STARS"" as the first guess. Wait, but maybe ""CRANE"" is better. Let me think again. Since the example had BRISK, maybe the secret word is something with common letters. Alternatively, maybe ""BRAVE"" is a good first guess because it has multiple letters that could be in the word. Let me go with ""BRAVE"" as my first guess. That way, if the feedback shows some letters are correct, I can adjust. Alternatively, maybe ""CRANE"" is better. Hmm. I think I'll go with ""CRANE"" first. Wait, but maybe ""BRAVE"" is more likely to have letters that are common. Let me check. Well, I need to make a choice. Let's pick ""BRAVE"" as the first guess.

Okay, let's see. The first guess was BRAVE, and the feedback was B(x), R(x), A(-), V(x), E(x). So that means none of the letters B, R, V, or E are in the word, but A is present but in the wrong position. Wait, no—the feedback says A(-), which means A is in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word has an A, but not in the third position (since BRAVE's A is in the third position). So the A must be in one of the other positions.

So the secret word has an A, but not in position 3. Also, B, R, V, E are not in the word. So we can eliminate those letters. Let's think of 5-letter words that include A, and don't have B, R, V, or E. Let's see. Possible letters could be C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Y, Z. But the word must be 5 letters. Let's think of words with A and avoiding the letters B, R, V, E. Maybe ""CABIN""? But that has B, which is excluded. Wait, no, the feedback said B(x), so B is not in the word. So CABIN is out. How about ""CANDY""? But that has Y and D, N, A. Wait, but the secret word has A. Let me think. Let's try ""CANDY""—but does that have any of the letters B, R, V, E? No. Wait, CANDY has C, A, N, D, Y. So A is present. But the feedback for BRAVE's A was in the wrong position. So in the secret word, A is in a different position than in BRAVE. Since BRAVE's A was in position 3, the secret word's A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

So possible words could be ""CANDY"" (A in position 2), ""CABIN"" (but has B, which is invalid), ""CRAZY"" (has R, which is invalid), ""CAMEL"" (has E, which is invalid). Wait, E is excluded. So ""CAMEL"" is out. How about ""CABIN"" is out because of B. ""CANDLE"" is 6 letters. ""CABIN"" is 5 letters but has B. ""CABIN"" is invalid. ""CABAL"" has B? No, CABAL is C, A, B, A, L. Oh, B is there. So that's invalid. So maybe ""CANDY"" is a possibility. Let me check. If the secret word is CANDY, then the letters are C, A, N, D, Y. The A is in position 2, which is different from BRAVE's position 3. So that would fit. But how do I know? Alternatively, maybe ""CANDY"" is not the word. Let me think of other words. ""CABIN"" is out. ""CABAL"" is out. ""CAMEL"" is out. ""CANDY"" is possible. Alternatively, ""CANDY"" is a good candidate. Let me try that. But maybe another word. Let's think of words with A and other letters not in B, R, V, E. Maybe ""CAMEL"" is out because of E. How about ""CABIN"" is out. ""CABIN"" is invalid. ""CABAL"" is invalid. ""CABIN"" is invalid. ""CABIN"" has B. So maybe ""CANDY"" is the best bet. Let me try ""CANDY"" as the next guess. Alternatively, maybe ""CANDY"" is not the right word. Let me think of another word. Maybe ""CABIN"" is out. What about ""CABIN"" is invalid. Maybe ""CABIN"" is not allowed. Let me think of ""CABIN"" again. No, B is excluded. So maybe ""CANDY"" is the next guess.

The first guess was BRAVE, and the feedback was B(x), R(x), A(-), V(x), E(x). So that means none of the letters B, R, V, or E are in the word, but A is present but in the wrong position. Wait, no—the feedback says A(-), which means A is in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word has an A, but not in the third position (since BRAVE\'s A is in the third position). So the A must be in one of the other positions.\n\nSo the secret word has an A, but not in position 3. Also, B, R, V, E are not in the word. So we can eliminate those letters. Let\'s think of 5-letter words that include A, and don\'t have B, R, V, or E. Let\'s see. Possible letters could be C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Y, Z. But the word must be 5 letters. Let\'s think of words with A and avoiding the letters B, R, V, E. Maybe ""CABIN""? But that has B, which is excluded. Wait, no, the feedback said B(x), so B is not in the word. So CABIN is out. How about ""CANDY""? But that has Y and D, N, A. Wait, but the secret word has A. Let me think. Let\'s try ""CANDY""—but does that have any of the letters B, R, V, E? No. Wait, CANDY has C, A, N, D, Y. So A is present. But the feedback for BRAVE\'s A was in the wrong position. So in the secret word, A is in a different position than in BRAVE. Since BRAVE\'s A was in position 3, the secret word\'s A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nSo possible words could be ""CANDY"" (A in position 2), ""CABIN"" (but has B, which is invalid), ""CRAZY"" (has R, which is invalid), ""CAMEL"" (has E, which is invalid). Wait, E is excluded. So ""CAMEL"" is out. How about ""CABIN"" is out because of B. ""CANDLE"" is 6 letters. ""CABIN"" is 5 letters but has B. ""CABIN"" is invalid. ""CABAL"" has B? No, CABAL is C, A, B, A, L. Oh, B is there. So that\'s invalid. So maybe ""CANDY"" is a possibility. Let me check. If the secret word is CANDY, then the letters are C, A, N, D, Y. The A is in position 2, which is different from BRAVE\'s position 3. So that would fit. But how do I know? Alternatively, maybe ""CANDY"" is not the word. Let me think of other words. ""CABIN"" is out. ""CABAL"" is out. ""CAMEL"" is out. ""CANDY"" is possible. Alternatively, ""CANDY"" is a good candidate. Let me try that. But maybe another word. Let\'s think of words with A and other letters not in B, R, V, E. Maybe ""CAMEL"" is out because of E. How about ""CABIN"" is out. ""CABIN"" is invalid. ""CABAL"" is invalid. ""CABIN"" is invalid. ""CABIN"" has B. So maybe ""CANDY"" is the best bet. Let me try ""CANDY"" as the next guess. Alternatively, maybe ""CANDY"" is not the right word. Let me think of another word. Maybe ""CABIN"" is out. What about ""CABIN"" is invalid. Maybe ""CABIN"" is not allowed. Let me think of ""CABIN"" again. No, B is excluded. So maybe ""CANDY"" is the next guess.

Okay, let's break down the feedback from the previous guesses. 

First guess was BRAVE, which gave feedback: B(x), R(x), A(-), V(x), E(x). So, B, R, V, E are not in the word. But A is present but in the wrong position. 

Second guess was CANDY, which gave feedback: C(✓), A(✓), N(x), D(✓), Y(✓). Wait, that's interesting. So C, A, D, Y are in the word, but N is not. But A is in the word, but in the second guess, A is in position 2 (CANDY: C-A-N-D-Y). The feedback says A(✓), which means A is in the word and in the correct position? Wait, no. Wait, the feedback symbols are: ✓ for correct position, - for wrong position, x for not in the word. 

Wait, the second guess was CANDY. The feedback is C(✓), A(✓), N(x), D(✓), Y(✓). So that means:

- C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- N is not in the word.
- D is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

Wait, but that would mean the secret word is C A _ D Y. But the feedback for A is ✓, which would mean that in the second guess, A was in the correct position. But the first feedback said that A was in the wrong position. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me check again.

Wait, the first feedback for BRAVE was A(-), meaning A is in the word but in the wrong position. But in the second guess, CANDY, the A is in position 2. If the feedback for A is ✓, that would mean that in the secret word, A is in position 2. But that contradicts the first feedback where A was in the wrong position. So there's a problem here. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the feedback. Let me re-examine the feedback.

Wait, the first guess was BRAVE, and the feedback was B(x), R(x), A(-), V(x), E(x). So A is in the word but in the wrong position. That means in the secret word, A is present, but not in position 3 (since in BRAVE, A is in position 3). 

Then, the second guess was CANDY, and the feedback is C(✓), A(✓), N(x), D(✓), Y(✓). So according to this, A is in the correct position (position 2). But that would mean that in the secret word, A is in position 2. But according to the first feedback, A was in the wrong position (position 3 in BRAVE). So if the secret word has A in position 2, that's possible. Wait, maybe the first feedback's A(-) means that in the first guess, A was in the wrong position, but in the second guess, A is in the correct position. So that would mean that the secret word has A in position 2. So that's okay. Because the first feedback says that A is in the word but in the wrong position (position 3 in BRAVE), but in the second guess, A is in position 2, which is correct. Therefore, the secret word has A in position 2. 

So the secret word has letters C, A, D, Y, and the third letter is not N (since N(x) in the second guess). So the secret word is C A _ D Y. The third letter is not N. So possible letters for position 3 could be anything except N. Also, from the first feedback, we know that B, R, V, E are not in the word. So the letters in the secret word are C, A, D, Y, and one more letter (position 3), which is not N. 

So possible letters for position 3: could be letters like F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, W, X, Z. But the word must be a valid 5-letter English word. 

So the secret word is C A _ D Y. Let's think of words that fit this pattern. For example, ""CADY"" is a word? Wait, no, that's 4 letters. ""CADY"" is a name, but maybe not a valid word. ""CADY"" is not a standard English word. How about ""CABDY""? No, that's not a word. ""CADDY""? Wait, CADDY is a word. But that would be C A D D Y. But in the second guess, the feedback for D was ✓, which would mean that D is in the correct position (position 4). But in CADDY, D is in position 3 and 4. Wait, the second guess was CANDY, which has D in position 4. If the secret word is CADDY, then in the second guess, D is in position 4 (correct), so that would be ✓. But the secret word would have two Ds. However, the feedback for the second guess's D is ✓, so that's okay. But the secret word could be CADDY. But the third letter in CADDY is D, which is allowed because the feedback for N was x. So that's possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CAYDY""? No, that's not a word. ""CAYLY""? No. ""CAYLY"" is not a word. ""CAYLY"" is not valid. 

Alternatively, ""CAYDO""? No. Maybe ""CAYLY"" is not valid. 

Wait, maybe the third letter is something else. Let's think of words that start with C, have A as the second letter, then a letter, then D, then Y. For example, ""CABDY"" is not a word. ""CADY"" is not a word. ""CADDY"" is a word. So maybe the secret word is CADDY. Let's check if that fits. 

If the secret word is CADDY, then:

- C is in position 1 (correct, as per feedback from CANDY's C(✓))
- A is in position 2 (correct, as per feedback from CANDY's A(✓))
- D is in position 4 (correct, as per feedback from CANDY's D(✓))
- Y is in position 5 (correct, as per feedback from CANDY's Y(✓))
- The third letter is D, which is not N (so N(x) is correct)

So that fits. But is CADDY a valid word? Yes, CADDY is a noun, a person who carries golf clubs. So that's a valid word. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CAYLY""? No, that's not a word. ""CAYLY"" is not valid. 

Alternatively, maybe ""CAYDO""? No. 

Alternatively, maybe the third letter is another letter. Let's think of other possibilities. For example, ""CABDY"" is not a word. ""CABDY"" is not valid. ""CABDY"" is not a word. 

Alternatively, ""CABDY"" is not valid. So maybe the secret word is CADDY. 

But wait, the feedback from the second guess was C(✓), A(✓), N(x), D(✓), Y(✓). So that means that the secret word has C, A, D, Y, and the third letter is not N. So if the secret word is CADDY, then that would fit. 

So the next guess would be to check if the third letter is D. But since the third letter is not N, maybe the third letter is D. So the word would be CADDY. 

Alternatively, maybe the third letter is something else. Let's think of other words. For example, ""CAYDY"" is not a word. ""CAYLY"" is not a word. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CADY"" plus another letter. Wait, but it's 5 letters. So maybe ""CADDY"" is the correct word. 

So the next guess would be to try CADDY. But since we have three tries left (since we used two guesses already), let's check. Wait, the user has 6 tries. So after two guesses, we have 4 tries left. Wait, but the user's first guess was BRAVE, second was CANDY, and now we need to make a third guess. 

But the feedback from the second guess shows that the secret word has C, A, D, Y. So the third letter is not N. So the third letter could be D (as in CADDY), or another letter. So the next guess should be a word that fits C A _ D Y. 

So possible words: CADDY, CAYDY (invalid), CADY (invalid), etc. 

Alternatively, maybe the third letter is something else. Let's think of words like ""CABBY"" but that has B, which is excluded. So no. ""CABBY"" is invalid. 

Alternatively, ""CABBY"" is invalid. ""CABBY"" has B, which is not allowed. 

So the only valid word that fits is CADDY. So the third guess would be CADDY. 

But wait, the secret word could be CADDY. Let's check if that's possible. 

So the third guess is CADDY. If that's the secret word, then the feedback would be all ✓. But if not, then we need to adjust. 

Alternatively, maybe the third letter is something else. For example, ""CAYLY"" is not a word. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CAYLY"" but that's not valid. 

Alternatively, maybe the third letter is ""O"", making the word ""CAODY""? Is that a word? CAODY is not a standard English word. 

Alternatively, ""CAYDY"" is not a word. 

So the most plausible word is CADDY. 

Therefore, the third guess is CADDY. 

But wait, let's check if CADDY is a valid word. Yes, it's a valid 5-letter word. 

So the third guess is CADDY. If that's the secret word, then the feedback would be all ✓. If not, then we need to adjust. 

But given the feedback from the second guess, which shows that the secret word has C, A, D, Y, and the third letter is not N, then CADDY is the best candidate. 

So I'll proceed with that.
