Okay, let's see. I need to guess a 5-letter word. The user hasn't given any feedback yet, so I have to make an educated guess. Since there's no feedback, I should pick a common or versatile 5-letter word that might be part of many words. Words like ""crane"", ""stone"", ""water"", or ""apple"" come to mind. But maybe something more common? Wait, maybe ""crane"" is a good choice because it's a common word and has letters that might be useful. Alternatively, ""earth"" is another common word. Hmm. Or maybe ""green""? Wait, but I need to make sure it's a valid 5-letter English word. Let me think. ""Crane"" is 5 letters. Yes. So I'll go with ""crane"" as the first guess. That's a safe bet. If the feedback comes back, I can adjust based on the symbols. But since there's no feedback yet, I just need to make the first guess. Alright, I'll pick ""crane"".

Okay, let's see. The first guess was CRANE, and the feedback was C(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(✓). So that means the secret word has R in the second position, A in the third, and E in the fifth. The letters C and N are not in the word. So the letters we know are R, A, E in positions 2, 3, 5. The other two positions (1 and 4) need to be determined. The letters that are not in the word are C and N. So possible letters for positions 1 and 4 could be other letters. Let's think about possible words. The word is 5 letters, with R in position 2, A in 3, E in 5. So the structure is _ R A _ E. The first and fourth letters need to be filled. Let's think of words that fit this pattern. Maybe ""BRAKE""? Let's check: B R A K E. Yes, that fits. But wait, does that fit the feedback? Let me check. The first guess was CRANE, and the feedback was R(✓), A(✓), E(✓). So if the secret word is BRAKE, then the letters B, R, A, K, E. The feedback for CRANE would have R in position 2 (correct), A in 3 (correct), E in 5 (correct). The other letters C and N are not in the word. So BRAKE would fit. But let me think if there are other possibilities. Another word could be ""GRAPE"" but that would have G in position 1, R in 2, A in 3, P in 4, E in 5. But the feedback for CRANE would have R(✓), A(✓), E(✓). So that's possible. But the fourth letter in GRAPE is P, which is not in the first guess. But the feedback for CRANE would have N(x), so N is not in the word. But P is allowed. However, the secret word could be BRAKE or GRAPE. Wait, but the feedback for CRANE is C(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(✓). So the secret word has R, A, E. So the other letters could be any except C and N. So possible letters for positions 1 and 4. Let's think of words that fit _ R A _ E. Maybe ""BRAKE"" is a good guess. Alternatively, ""DRAKE"" (D R A K E). That's another possibility. Or ""FRAKE""? Not sure if that's a word. Let me check. ""BRAKE"" is a valid word. So maybe BRAKE is the secret word. But I need to make sure. Alternatively, ""GRAPE"" is also a valid word. But the feedback for CRANE would have E in position 5, which is correct. So maybe the secret word is BRAKE. Let me check if BRAKE is a possible answer. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""GRAPE"". But then the fourth letter is P. Let me think. Since the first guess was CRANE, and the feedback shows that R, A, E are correct. So the secret word has those letters. So the next guess could be BRAKE. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, BRAKE is a valid 5-letter word. So I'll go with BRAKE as the second guess.

Okay, let's see. The previous guesses were CRANE and BRAKE. The feedback for CRANE was C(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(✓). So the secret word has R in position 2, A in 3, and E in 5. The letters C and N are not in the word. Then, for BRAKE, the feedback was B(x), R(✓), A(✓), K(x), E(✓). So the secret word has R, A, E again. But now, the letters B and K are not in the word. So the letters that are definitely in the word are R, A, E. The letters that are not in the word are C, N, B, K. So the remaining letters to determine are positions 1 and 4. The secret word is structured as _ R A _ E. The first letter can't be C, N, B, K. The fourth letter can't be C, N, B, K. So possible letters for position 1: D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Similarly for position 4. Let's think of words that fit this structure. The first letter could be D, making the word DRAKE. Let's check if DRAKE is a valid word. Yes, DRAKE is a noun meaning a male dragon. Alternatively, maybe ""DRAKE"" is the secret word. But let's check the feedback. If the secret word is DRAKE, then the letters D, R, A, K, E. But in the second guess, BRAKE, the feedback for K was (x), which would be correct because K is not in the secret word. Wait, but if the secret word is DRAKE, then K is not in it. So that's consistent. But the feedback for BRAKE would have K(x), which matches. So DRAKE would fit. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""DRAKE"". Let me check if there's another possibility. Another word could be ""GRAPE"", but that would have G in position 1 and P in 4. But the feedback for BRAKE shows that K is not in the word, but P is allowed. However, the secret word could be GRAPE. But then the first letter is G, which is not in the first guess CRANE (so that's allowed), and the fourth letter is P. But the feedback for BRAKE would have K(x), which is correct because K is not in the secret word. So GRAPE is possible. But how to choose between DRAKE and GRAPE? Let's think of other possibilities. Another word could be ""FRAKE"" but that's not a standard word. ""DRAKE"" is valid. Alternatively, ""DRAKE"" is a good candidate. Let me check if there's any other letters that could fit. The first letter could be D, so DRAKE. Let me go with DRAKE as the next guess. But wait, the fourth letter in DRAKE is K, which was in the second guess and marked as (x), so that's correct. So if the secret word is DRAKE, then the fourth letter is K, but the feedback for BRAKE would have K(x), which is correct. So that's consistent. Therefore, the next guess could be DRAKE. Alternatively, maybe ""GRAPE"" is the secret word. But I need to pick a word that fits the structure. Let me think of other words. ""DRAKE"" seems plausible. So I'll go with DRAKE as the third guess.

<guess>DRAKE</guess>",DRAKE,"Okay, let's see. The previous guesses were CRANE and BRAKE. The feedback for CRANE was C(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(✓). So the secret word has R in position 2, A in 3, and E in 5. The letters C and N are not in the word. Then, for BRAKE, the feedback was B(x), R(✓), A(✓), K(x), E(✓). So the secret word has R, A, E again. But now, the letters B and K are not in the word. So the letters that are definitely in the word are R, A, E. The letters that are not in the word are C, N, B, K. So the remaining letters to determine are positions 1 and 4. The secret word is structured as _ R A _ E. The first letter can't be C, N, B, K. The fourth letter can't be C, N, B, K. So possible letters for position 1: D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Similarly for position 4. Let's think of words that fit this structure. The first letter could be D, making the word DRAKE. Let's check if DRAKE is a valid word. Yes, DRAKE is a noun meaning a male dragon. Alternatively, maybe ""DRAKE"" is the secret word. But let's check the feedback. If the secret word is DRAKE, then the letters D, R, A, K, E. But in the second guess, BRAKE, the feedback for K was (x), which would be correct because K is not in the secret word. Wait, but if the secret word is DRAKE, then K is not in it. So that's consistent. But the feedback for BRAKE would have K(x), which matches. So DRAKE would fit. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""DRAKE"". Let me check if there's another possibility. Another word could be ""GRAPE"", but that would have G in position 1 and P in 4. But the feedback for BRAKE shows that K is not in the word, but P is allowed. However, the secret word could be GRAPE. But then the first letter is G, which is not in the first guess CRANE (so that's allowed), and the fourth letter is P. But the feedback for BRAKE would have K(x), which is correct because K is not in the secret word. So GRAPE is possible. But how to choose between DRAKE and GRAPE? Let's think of other possibilities. Another word could be ""FRAKE"" but that's not a standard word. ""DRAKE"" is valid. Alternatively, ""DRAKE"" is a good candidate. Let me check if there's any other letters that could fit. The first letter could be D, so DRAKE. Let me go with DRAKE as the next guess. But wait, the fourth letter in DRAKE is K, which was in the second guess and marked as (x), so that's correct. So if the secret word is DRAKE, then the fourth letter is K, but the feedback for BRAKE would have K(x), which is correct. So that's consistent. Therefore, the next guess could be DRAKE.

Since there's no feedback, I should pick a common or versatile 5-letter word that might be part of many words. Words like ""crane"", ""stone"", ""water"", or ""apple"" come to mind. But maybe something more common? Wait, maybe ""crane"" is a good choice because it's a common word and has letters that might be useful. Alternatively, ""earth"" is another common word. Hmm.

Okay, let's see. The first guess was CRANE, and the feedback was C(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(✓). So that means the secret word has R in the second position, A in the third, and E in the fifth. The letters C and N are not in the word. So the letters we know are R, A, E in positions 2, 3, 5. The other two positions (1 and 4) need to be determined. The letters that are not in the word are C and N. So possible letters for positions 1 and 4 could be other letters. Let's think about possible words. The word is 5 letters, with R in position 2, A in 3, E in 5. So the structure is _ R A _ E. The first and fourth letters need to be filled. Let's think of words that fit this pattern. Maybe ""BRAKE""? Let's check: B R A K E. Yes, that fits. But wait, does that fit the feedback? Let me check. The first guess was CRANE, and the feedback was R(✓), A(✓), E(✓). So if the secret word is BRAKE, then the letters B, R, A, K, E. The feedback for CRANE would have R in position 2 (correct), A in 3 (correct), E in 5 (correct). The other letters C and N are not in the word. So BRAKE would fit. But let me think if there are other possibilities. Another word could be ""GRAPE"" but that would have G in position 1, R in 2, A in 3, P in 4, E in 5. But the feedback for CRANE would have R(✓), A(✓), E(✓). So that's possible. But the fourth letter in GRAPE is P, which is not in the first guess. But the feedback for CRANE would have N(x), so N is not in the word. But P is allowed. However, the secret word could be BRAKE or GRAPE. Wait, but the feedback for CRANE is C(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(✓). So the secret word has R, A, E. So the other letters could be any except C and N. So possible letters for positions 1 and 4. Let's think of words that fit _ R A _ E. Maybe ""BRAKE"" is a good guess. Alternatively, ""DRAKE"" (D R A K E). That's another possibility. Or ""FRAKE""? Not sure if that's a word. Let me check. ""BRAKE"" is a valid word. So maybe BRAKE is the secret word. But I need to make sure. Alternatively, ""GRAPE"" is also a valid word. But the feedback for CRANE would have E in position 5, which is correct. So maybe the secret word is BRAKE. Let me check if BRAKE is a possible answer. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""GRAPE"". But then the fourth letter is P. Let me think. Since the first guess was CRANE, and the feedback shows that R, A, E are correct. So the secret word has those letters. So the next guess could be BRAKE. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, BRAKE is a valid 5-letter word. So I'll go with BRAKE as the second guess.

Maybe ""BRAKE""? Let's check: B R A K E. Yes, that fits. But wait, does that fit the feedback? Let me check. The first guess was CRANE, and the feedback was R(✓), A(✓), E(✓). So if the secret word is BRAKE, then the letters B, R, A, K, E. The feedback for CRANE would have R in position 2 (correct), A in 3 (correct), E in 5 (correct). The other letters C and N are not in the word. So BRAKE would fit. But let me think if there are other possibilities. Another word could be ""GRAPE"" but that would have G in position 1, R in 2, A in 3, P in 4, E in 5. But the feedback for CRANE would have R(✓), A(✓), E(✓). So that's possible. But the fourth letter in GRAPE is P, which is not in the first guess. But the feedback for CRANE would have N(x), so N is not in the word. But P is allowed. However, the secret word could be BRAKE or GRAPE. Wait, but the feedback for CRANE is C(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(✓). So the secret word has R, A, E. So the other letters could be any except C and N. So possible letters for positions 1 and 4. Let's think of words that fit _ R A _ E. Maybe ""BRAKE"" is a good guess. Alternatively, ""DRAKE"" (D R A K E). That's another possibility. Or ""FRAKE""? Not sure if that's a word. Let me check. ""BRAKE"" is a valid word. So maybe BRAKE is the secret word. But I need to make sure. Alternatively, ""GRAPE"" is also a valid word. But the feedback for CRANE would have E in position 5, which is correct. So maybe the secret word is BRAKE. Let me check if BRAKE is a possible answer. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""GRAPE"". But then the fourth letter is P. Let me think. Since the first guess was CRANE, and the feedback shows that R, A, E are correct. So the secret word has those letters. So the next guess could be BRAKE. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, BRAKE is a valid 5-letter word. So I'll go with BRAKE as the second guess.

Okay, let's see. The previous guesses were CRANE and BRAKE. The feedback for CRANE was C(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(✓). So the secret word has R in position 2, A in 3, and E in 5. The letters C and N are not in the word. Then, for BRAKE, the feedback was B(x), R(✓), A(✓), K(x), E(✓). So the secret word has R, A, E again. But now, the letters B and K are not in the word. So the letters that are definitely in the word are R, A, E. The letters that are not in the word are C, N, B, K. So the remaining letters to determine are positions 1 and 4. The secret word is structured as _ R A _ E. The first letter can't be C, N, B, K. The fourth letter can't be C, N, B, K. So possible letters for position 1: D, F, G, H, J, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Similarly for position 4. Let's think of words that fit this structure. The first letter could be D, making the word DRAKE. Let's check if DRAKE is a valid word. Yes, DRAKE is a noun meaning a male dragon. Alternatively, maybe ""DRAKE"" is the secret word. But let's check the feedback. If the secret word is DRAKE, then the letters D, R, A, K, E. But in the second guess, BRAKE, the feedback for K was (x), which would be correct because K is not in the secret word. Wait, but if the secret word is DRAKE, then K is not in it. So that's consistent. But the feedback for BRAKE would have K(x), which matches. So DRAKE would fit. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""DRAKE"". Let me check if there's another possibility. Another word could be ""GRAPE"", but that would have G in position 1 and P in 4. But the feedback for BRAKE shows that K is not in the word, but P is allowed. However, the secret word could be GRAPE. But then the first letter is G, which is not in the first guess CRANE (so that's allowed), and the fourth letter is P. But the feedback for BRAKE would have K(x), which is correct because K is not in the secret word. So GRAPE is possible. But how to choose between DRAKE and GRAPE? Let's think of other possibilities. Another word could be ""FRAKE"" but that's not a standard word. ""DRAKE"" is valid. Alternatively, ""DRAKE"" is a good candidate. Let me check if there's any other letters that could fit. The first letter could be D, so DRAKE. Let me go with DRAKE as the next guess. But wait, the fourth letter in DRAKE is K, which was in the second guess and marked as (x), so that's correct. So if the secret word is DRAKE, then the fourth letter is K, but the feedback for BRAKE would have K(x), which is correct. So that's consistent. Therefore, the next guess could be DRAKE. Alternatively, maybe ""GRAPE"" is the secret word. But I need to pick a word that fits the structure. Let me think of other words. ""DRAKE"" seems plausible. So I'll go with DRAKE as the third guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: BRAKE -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) A(✓) K(x) E(✓)

Okay, let's see. The previous guesses were CRANE, BRAKE, and DRAKE. The feedback for each is as follows:

- CRANE: C(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(x), E(✓)
- BRAKE: B(x), R(✓), A(✓), K(x), E(✓)
- DRAKE: D(x), R(✓), A(✓), K(x), E(✓)

So, from this, the letters R, A, E are definitely in the word and in the correct positions (2nd, 3rd, and 5th letters). The letters C, N, B, K, D are not in the word. So the secret word is structured as _ R A _ E. The first and fourth letters are not among the excluded letters (C, N, B, K, D). So possible letters for the first position could be F, G, H, J, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Similarly for the fourth position.

Now, the next guess needs to be a 5-letter word that fits this structure. Let's think of possible words. The first letter could be F, making the word FRAPE? Wait, but that's not a valid word. Or maybe ""FRAKE""? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe ""GRAPE"" (G R A P E). Let's check if that's possible. The first letter is G, which is allowed (not in the excluded letters). The fourth letter is P, which is allowed. So GRAPE would fit the structure. But wait, in the previous guess DRAKE, the fourth letter was K, which was marked as (x), so K is not in the word. So P is allowed. So GRAPE could be the secret word. Alternatively, maybe ""GRAPE"" is the answer. Let me check if there's another possibility. Another word could be ""FRAPE"" but that's not a real word. ""GRAPE"" is valid. Let me check if there are other words. ""DRAKE"" was tried, but D is excluded. ""GRAPE"" seems like a good candidate. So the next guess would be GRAPE. Let me confirm that all letters are allowed. G is not in the excluded list (C, N, B, K, D), so yes. P is allowed. So GRAPE is a valid guess. Let's go with that.

Okay, let's break this down. The secret word is a 5-letter word. From the previous guesses and feedback, I know the following:

- The second letter is R (✓).
- The third letter is A (✓).
- The fifth letter is E (✓).
- The letters C, N, B, K, D are not in the word (all marked as x in previous guesses).
- The first letter: In guess 4 (GRAPE), the first letter G was marked as ✓. So G is in the word and in the correct position (position 1). So the first letter is G.
- The fourth letter: In guess 4 (GRAPE), the fourth letter P was marked as x, meaning P is not in the word. So the fourth letter can't be P.

So the structure of the word is now G R A _ E. The fourth letter is not P, and it can't be any of the excluded letters (C, N, B, K, D). So possible letters for the fourth position are F, H, J, L, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we need a valid 5-letter word.

Let me think of words that fit G R A _ E. The fourth letter needs to be a letter that's not in the excluded list and makes a valid word. Let's consider possible letters:

- If the fourth letter is T, then the word would be GRA TE? Wait, that's G R A T E. ""GRA TE"" isn't a word. But ""GRATE"" is a valid word. Wait, GRA TE is ""grate"" spelled correctly. Yes, ""grate"" is a 5-letter word. Let me check: G (1), R (2), A (3), T (4), E (5). That fits the structure. And since in the previous guess, GRAPE had P as the fourth letter, which was marked as x, so T is allowed. So ""grate"" would be the correct word. Let me confirm if there are any other possibilities. Another option could be ""GRAPE"" but P was excluded. So ""grate"" seems to fit. Therefore, the secret word is GRATE.

But wait, let me check the feedback for GRAPE. The feedback was G(✓), R(✓), A(✓), P(x), E(✓). So that means G, R, A, E are correct, and P is not. So the fourth letter is not P. So the correct word must have G, R, A, and E, with the fourth letter being something else. So ""grate"" is the correct answer. Therefore, the next guess should be GRATE.

But wait, the user hasn't given any feedback yet for this guess. So I need to make the next guess. Since the previous guess was GRAPE, and the feedback shows that the fourth letter is not P, the next guess should be GRATE. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, ""grate"" is a valid 5-letter word. So I'll go with that.

<guess>GRATE</guess>

<guess>GRATE</guess>",GRATE,"Okay, let's break this down. The secret word is a 5-letter word. From the previous guesses and feedback, I know the following:

- The second letter is R (✓).
- The third letter is A (✓).
- The fifth letter is E (✓).
- The letters C, N, B, K, D are not in the word (all marked as x in previous guesses).
- The first letter: In guess 4 (GRAPE), the first letter G was marked as ✓. So G is in the word and in the correct position (position 1). So the first letter is G.
- The fourth letter: In guess 4 (GRAPE), the fourth letter P was marked as x, meaning P is not in the word. So the fourth letter can't be P.

So the structure of the word is now G R A _ E. The fourth letter is not P, and it can't be any of the excluded letters (C, N, B, K, D). So possible letters for the fourth position are F, H, J, L, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we need a valid 5-letter word.

Let me think of words that fit G R A _ E. The fourth letter needs to be a letter that's not in the excluded list and makes a valid word. Let's consider possible letters:

- If the fourth letter is T, then the word would be GRA TE? Wait, that's G R A T E. ""GRA TE"" isn't a word. But ""GRATE"" is a valid word. Wait, GRA TE is ""grate"" spelled correctly. Yes, ""grate"" is a 5-letter word. Let me check: G (1), R (2), A (3), T (4), E (5). That fits the structure. And since in the previous guess, GRAPE had P as the fourth letter, which was marked as x, so T is allowed. So ""grate"" would be the correct word. Let me confirm if there are any other possibilities. Another option could be ""GRAPE"" but P was excluded. So ""grate"" seems to fit. Therefore, the secret word is GRATE.

But wait, let me check the feedback for GRAPE. The feedback was G(✓), R(✓), A(✓), P(x), E(✓). So that means G, R, A, E are correct, and P is not. So the fourth letter is not P. So the correct word must have G, R, A, and E, with the fourth letter being something else. So ""grate"" is the correct answer. Therefore, the next guess should be GRATE.

But wait, the user hasn't given any feedback yet for this guess. So I need to make the next guess. Since the previous guess was GRAPE, and the feedback shows that the fourth letter is not P, the next guess should be GRATE. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, ""grate"" is a valid 5-letter word. So I'll go with that.
