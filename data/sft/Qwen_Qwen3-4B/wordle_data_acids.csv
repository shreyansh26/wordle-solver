Okay, I need to guess a 5-letter word. Let me think. Since I don't have any feedback yet, I should choose a common or versatile word that might have letters that are likely to be in the secret word. Maybe something like ""CRANE"" because it's a common word and has different letters that could be useful. Alternatively, ""BRAVE"" is another option, but maybe ""CRANE"" is better. Wait, but I should pick a word that's easy to adjust based on feedback. Let me go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess. If the feedback comes back, I can adjust based on the symbols. Let's see.

Okay, let me process the feedback from the first guess. The secret word is a 5-letter word, and my first guess was ""CRANE"". The feedback was C(-), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x). So, let's break down each letter:

- C is in the word but in the wrong position (-). So C is present but not in the first position.
- R is not in the word (x). So R is excluded.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-). So A is present but not in the third position.
- N is not in the word (x). So N is excluded.
- E is not in the word (x). So E is excluded.

So from this, the letters we know are C, A. But their positions are not correct. Also, R, N, E are not in the word. So the secret word has C and A, but not in the positions they were in the first guess. Let's think about possible letters. The word is 5 letters, so we need three more letters. Let's consider letters that are common and not excluded. The excluded letters are R, N, E. So possible letters could be B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we know that C and A are in the word.

So possible letters. Let me think of words that include C and A, and don't have R, N, E. Let's think of words like ""CABIN"" but N is excluded. Wait, N is excluded, so that's out. How about ""CABAL""? But that has an L. Wait, but the secret word is 5 letters. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word has C and A in different positions. Let me think of possible words. Let's try ""CABIN"" but N is excluded. So no. ""CABAL"" has A and C. Let me check if that's possible. But the feedback for the first guess had A in the wrong position. So if the secret word is CABAL, then A is in position 2 (third letter in CABAL is A?), wait. Wait, CABAL is C-A-B-A-L. So the first guess was CRANE: positions 1=C, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=E. The secret word's A is in position 3 (third letter) in the first guess, but the feedback says A is in the wrong position. So if the secret word has A in position 3, but in the first guess, A was in position 3, but the feedback was A(-), meaning it's in the word but wrong position. Wait, that's a contradiction. Wait, no. Wait, the feedback for A was (-), which means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. So if the secret word has A in position 3, but in the first guess, A was in position 3, then that would be a ✓, not a -. So that suggests that the secret word's A is not in position 3. Therefore, the A must be in a different position. So the secret word has A in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5. But in the first guess, the A was in position 3, which is wrong. So the secret word's A is in another position.

So possible letters: C and A are in the word. Let's think of words that have C and A, and don't have R, N, E. Let's think of words like ""CABIN"" but N is excluded. ""CABAL"" is possible. Let's check. CABAL: C-A-B-A-L. So letters are C, A, B, A, L. So that has two A's. But the feedback for the first guess had A(-), meaning that A is present but in the wrong position. So if the secret word is CABAL, then in the first guess, A was in position 3, but in the secret word, A is in position 2 and 4. So the first guess's A in position 3 would be wrong, so that's correct. So CABAL could be a possibility.

But I need to think of another word. Alternatively, maybe ""CABIN"" is not possible because of N. How about ""CABIN"" is out. What about ""CABAD""? Not a real word. ""CABAL"" is a valid word. So maybe CABAL is the secret word. But I need to check if that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CABIN"" but with N excluded. Wait, N is excluded, so that's not possible. So CABAL is a possible candidate. But I need to think of another word. Let's try ""CABIN"" again, but N is excluded, so no. How about ""CABIN"" is not possible. What about ""CABAL"" as a possible word. So if the secret word is CABAL, then my next guess could be CABAL. But I need to make sure that the letters are correct.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CABIN"" but without N. Wait, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CABIN"" but with N replaced by another letter. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CABIN"" but that's not possible. Let me think of other words. How about ""CABIN"" is out. What about ""CABAL""? Let me try that. If I guess CABAL, then let's see the feedback. But I need to think of another approach. Since the secret word has C and A, and not R, N, E. Let's think of other letters. Maybe the third letter is B, as in CABAL. So maybe the secret word is CABAL. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CABIN"" but with N replaced by another letter. Wait, but N is excluded, so that's not possible. So maybe the secret word is CABAL. Let's try that. But I need to make sure that the letters are correct. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CABIN"" but that's not possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CABIN"" but since N is excluded, that's not possible. So maybe the secret word is ""CABAL"". So my next guess could be CABAL. Let's check. But I need to make sure that the letters are correct. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CABIN"" but that's not possible. So maybe CABAL is the right word. Let me try that. So my next guess would be CABAL. But I need to check if that's a valid word. Yes, CABAL is a valid 5-letter word. So I'll go with that. But I need to make sure that the letters are correct. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CABIN"" but that's not possible. So I'll proceed with CABAL as the next guess.

The secret word is a 5-letter word, and my first guess was ""CRANE"". The feedback was C(-), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x). So, let\'s break down each letter:\n\n- C is in the word but in the wrong position (-). So C is present but not in the first position.\n- R is not in the word (x). So R is excluded.\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-). So A is present but not in the third position.\n- N is not in the word (x). So N is excluded.\n- E is not in the word (x). So E is excluded.\n\nSo from this, the letters we know are C, A. But their positions are not correct. Also, R, N, E are not in the word. So the secret word has C and A, but not in the positions they were in the first guess. Let\'s think about possible letters. The word is 5 letters, so we need three more letters. Let\'s consider letters that are common and not excluded. The excluded letters are R, N, E. So possible letters could be B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we know that C and A are in the word.\n\nSo possible letters. Let me think of words that include C and A, and don\'t have R, N, E. Let\'s think of words like ""CABIN"" but N is excluded. Wait, N is excluded, so that\'s out. How about ""CABAL""? But that has an L. Wait, but the secret word is 5 letters. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the secret word has C and A in different positions. Let me think of possible words. Let\'s try ""CABIN"" but N is excluded. So no. ""CABAL"" has A and C. Let me check if that\'s possible. But the feedback for the first guess had A in the wrong position. So if the secret word is CABAL, then A is in position 2 (third letter in CABAL is A?), wait. Wait, CABAL is C-A-B-A-L. So the first guess was CRANE: positions 1=C, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=E. The secret word\'s A is in position 3 (third letter) in the first guess, but the feedback says A is in the wrong position. So if the secret word has A in position 3, but in the first guess, A was in position 3, but the feedback was A(-), meaning it\'s in the word but wrong position. Wait, that\'s a contradiction. Wait, no. Wait, the feedback for A was (-), which means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. So if the secret word has A in position 3, but in the first guess, A was in position 3, then that would be a ✓, not a -. So that suggests that the secret word\'s A is not in position 3. Therefore, the A must be in a different position. So the secret word has A in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5. But in the first guess, the A was in position 3, which is wrong. So the secret word\'s A is in another position.\n\nSo possible letters: C and A are in the word. Let\'s think of words that have C and A, and don\'t have R, N, E. Let\'s think of words like ""CABIN"" but N is excluded. ""CABAL"" is possible. Let\'s check. CABAL: C-A-B-A-L. So letters are C, A, B, A, L. So that has two A\'s. But the feedback for the first guess had A(-), meaning that A is present but in the wrong position. So if the secret word is CABAL, then in the first guess, A was in position 3, but in the secret word, A is in position 2 and 4. So the first guess\'s A in position 3 would be wrong, so that\'s correct. So CABAL could be a possibility.\n\nBut I need to think of another word. Alternatively, maybe ""CABIN"" is not possible because of N. How about ""CABIN"" is out. What about ""CABAD""? Not a real word. ""CABAL"" is a valid word. So maybe CABAL is the secret word. But I need to check if that\'s possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CABIN"" but with N excluded. Wait, N is excluded, so that\'s not possible. So CABAL is a possible candidate. But I need to think of another word. Let\'s try ""CABIN"" again, but N is excluded, so no. How about ""CABIN"" is not possible. What about ""CABAL"" as a possible word. So if the secret word is CABAL, then my next guess could be CABAL. But I need to make sure that the letters are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CABIN"" but without N.

Okay, let me try to figure out the secret word based on the feedback from the first two guesses. 

First guess was CRANE, and the feedback was C(-), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x). That means C is in the word but not in position 1, R is not in the word, A is in the word but not in position 3, N is not in the word, and E is not in the word. 

Second guess was CABAL, and the feedback was C(-), A(-), B(x), A(-), L(x). So C is still in the word but not in position 1 (since the first letter of CABAL is C, which got a -). A is in the word but not in position 2 (since in CABAL, A is in position 2, but the feedback says A(-)), and position 4 (since in CABAL, A is in position 4, but the feedback says A(-) again). Wait, but the feedback for CABAL is C(-), A(-), B(x), A(-), L(x). So the letters in CABAL are C, A, B, A, L. The feedback indicates that C is in the word but not in position 1 (so C is present but not in first position), A is in the word but in wrong positions (so A is present but not in positions 2 or 4?), B is not in the word, and L is not in the word. 

So from the first feedback, we know that the secret word has C and A. From the second feedback, we know that B and L are not in the word. Also, since in CABAL, the A's are in positions 2 and 4, but the feedback says A(-) for both, that means the secret word has A but not in those positions. So A must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But in the first guess, A was in position 3 and got a -, so that's not possible. Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 5. 

Also, from the first feedback, C is in the word but not in position 1. So C must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. But in the second guess, C was in position 1 again, which got a -, so C is not in position 1. So C must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. 

So far, the letters we know are C and A. The letters B and L are excluded. Also, R, N, E are excluded from the first guess. So the secret word can't have R, N, E, B, L. So possible letters are C, A, and others like D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. 

Now, the secret word has C and A. Let's think of possible words. Let's consider that A is in position 1 or 5. Let's try to find a word that includes C and A, and doesn't have B, L, R, N, E. 

Possible words: 

- ""ACCOM"" – but that's not a valid word. 
- ""ACID"" is 4 letters. 
- ""ACUTE"" – but E is excluded. 
- ""ACID"" is too short. 
- ""ACRID"" – but R is excluded. 
- ""ACCOM"" – not valid. 
- ""ACARS"" – but S is allowed. Wait, ACARS is a word? Maybe not. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CABIN"" but N is excluded. So that's not possible. 

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""CABIN"" but without N. But that's not possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CABIN"" but with N replaced by another letter. But N is excluded. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CABIN"" but that's not possible. 

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""CABIN"" but with N excluded. So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CABIN"" but that's not possible. 

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think again. The letters allowed are C, A, and others not in the excluded list. Let's think of words that have C and A. 

What about ""CABIN"" – but N is excluded. 

What about ""CABAD"" – not a valid word. 

What about ""CABIN"" – no. 

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""CABIN"" but with N replaced by another letter. But N is excluded. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CABIN"" but that's not possible.

This is getting me stuck. Let me try to think of other possibilities.

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""CABIN"" but that's not possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CABIN"" but that's not possible. 

Wait, perhaps the secret word is ""CABIN"" but that's not possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CABIN"" but that's not possible. 

Hmm. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let's look at the letters we know. The secret word has C and A. The letters B and L are excluded. Also, R, N, E are excluded. So possible letters are C, A, and others not in the excluded list. 

Let me think of words that start with A. For example, ""ACADE"" – but that's not a valid word. ""ACIDS"" – but S is allowed. Wait, ""ACIDS"" is 5 letters. But the secret word has C and A. Let me check: A, C, I, D, S. But the letters I, D, S are allowed. However, the secret word may not have I, D, S. But that's possible. However, the feedback from the first guess didn't mention I, D, S. So maybe that's possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""ACIDS"" but that's a possibility. Let me check if that fits. 

But the feedback from the first guess was that C is in the word but not in position 1. If the secret word is ""ACIDS"", then C is in position 3. That would fit the feedback for C(-) (since in the first guess, C was in position 1, which is wrong). Also, A is in position 1, which would be correct if the secret word has A in position 1. But in the first guess, A was in position 3, which got a -, meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. So if the secret word is ""ACIDS"", then A is in position 1, which is correct. That would fit. 

But let's check the feedback for the second guess, which was CABAL. The feedback was C(-), A(-), B(x), A(-), L(x). So in CABAL, the letters are C, A, B, A, L. The secret word has C and A, but not B or L. So if the secret word is ""ACIDS"", then B and L are not present, which fits. 

So ""ACIDS"" is a possible candidate. But is that a valid word? Yes, ""acids"" is a valid 5-letter word. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""ACIDS"". Let me check if that fits all the feedback. 

First guess: CRANE. Secret word is ACIDS. 

C is in position 3 (secret word), but in the first guess, C is in position 1. So feedback for C is -, which matches. 

R is not in the word (secret word has no R), so R(x). 

A is in position 1 (secret word), but in the first guess, A is in position 3. So the feedback for A is -, which matches. 

N is not in the word (secret word has no N), so N(x). 

E is not in the word (secret word has no E), so E(x). 

Second guess: CABAL. Secret word is ACIDS. 

C is in position 3 (secret word), but in the guess, C is in position 1. So feedback for C is -, which matches. 

A is in position 1 (secret word), but in the guess, A is in position 2. So the feedback for A is -, which matches. 

B is not in the word (secret word has no B), so B(x). 

A is in position 4 (guess), but in the secret word, A is in position 1. So feedback for A is -, which matches. 

L is not in the word (secret word has no L), so L(x). 

So all feedbacks match. Therefore, the secret word could be ""ACIDS"". 

But wait, the secret word is 5 letters. ""ACIDS"" is 5 letters. So that's possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""ACIDS"". But I need to make sure that there are no other possible words. 

Another possibility: ""ACIDS"" or ""ACID"" but that's 4 letters. 

Alternatively, ""ACID"" is 4 letters. 

Alternatively, ""ACIDS"" is the correct word. 

So my next guess could be ""ACIDS"". Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, ""acids"" is a valid 5-letter word. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""ACIDS"". 

So I'll go with that as my next guess.
