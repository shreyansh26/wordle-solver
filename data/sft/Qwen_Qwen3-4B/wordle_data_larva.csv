Okay, let's see. I need to guess a 5-letter word. The secret word is somewhere in the list of possible 5-letter English words. Since I don't have any feedback yet, my first guess should be a word that's common and might have letters that are likely to be in the secret word. Maybe something like ""CRANE"" because it's a common word and has vowels that might be useful. Alternatively, ""STARS"" could be a good choice because it's common and has multiple letters that might be in the secret word. Wait, but I should pick a word that's more likely to have letters that are common in other words. Let me think. Maybe ""CRANE"" is better because it's a common word and has a mix of letters. Let me go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess. If the feedback comes back, I can adjust based on the symbols. But since I don't have any feedback yet, I just need to pick a word that's valid. Alternatively, maybe ""BRAVE"" is a good first guess because it's a common word with multiple letters that could be in the secret word. Hmm. But I need to make sure it's a valid 5-letter word. Both are valid. Let me pick ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

Okay, let's see. The first guess was CRANE, and the feedback was C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x). So that means none of the letters C, N, or E are in the secret word. Wait, no—wait, the feedback symbols: x means the letter is not in the word. So C is not in the word, R is in the word but in the wrong position, A is in the word but wrong position, N is not in the word, E is not in the word. Wait, no. Wait, the feedback for each letter is:

C(x): So C is not in the word.

R(-): R is in the word but in the wrong position.

A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position.

N(x): N is not in the word.

E(x): E is not in the word.

So from this, the secret word has R and A, but not in the positions they were in CRANE. Also, letters C, N, E are excluded.

So the secret word has R and A, but not in positions 1 and 3 (since in CRANE, R was in position 2 and A in position 3). So R is in the word but not in position 2, and A is in the word but not in position 3.

So possible letters: R and A are present. Also, the secret word is 5 letters, so we need three more letters. Also, letters C, N, E are excluded. So possible letters could be other letters.

So next guess needs to include R and A, but in different positions. Also, avoid C, N, E.

Let me think of words that have R and A. For example, ""RARES"" but that has two R's. Or ""ARISE"" but that has an S and I. Wait, but the secret word could have other letters. Let me think of possible words. Maybe ""RABID"" but that has a D and I. Or ""RALLY"" but that has two L's. Alternatively, ""RANCH"" but N is excluded. Wait, N is excluded, so N can't be in the word. So ""RANCH"" is out because of N. So maybe ""RABID"" is possible. But let me check letters. R, A, B, I, D. But the secret word has R and A. So that's possible. Alternatively, ""RABAT"" but that's not a common word. Or ""RABID"". Alternatively, ""RADIO"" but that has O. Wait, but the secret word could have other letters. Let me think of a word that includes R and A, and doesn't have C, N, E. Let me try ""RABID"". But maybe ""RABAT"" is not a valid word. Alternatively, ""RALLY"" but that has L and Y. Alternatively, ""RASPY"" but that has P and Y. Hmm. Maybe ""RASPS"" but that has S and P. Alternatively, ""RASPS"" is a word. But I need to make sure that the letters are allowed. Since the secret word has R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3. So maybe the next guess could be ""RASPS"". Let's see. But I need to make sure that the letters are allowed. Alternatively, ""RABID"" is a valid word. Let me check: R, A, B, I, D. So that's a 5-letter word. But I need to make sure that the letters are allowed. Since the secret word has R and A, but not C, N, E. So maybe ""RABID"" is a possible guess. Alternatively, ""RABAT"" is not a valid word. Alternatively, ""RABID"" is better. Let me go with ""RABID"" as the next guess. But wait, maybe there's a better word. Alternatively, ""RASPY"" but that has P and Y. Let me think. Another approach: since the secret word has R and A, maybe the word is something like ""RADIO"" but that has O. But the secret word could have O. Let me check if O is allowed. Since in the first guess, O wasn't in CRANE, so O is allowed. So ""RADIO"" is a possible word. But that has R, A, D, I, O. So that's possible. But maybe ""RADIO"" is a better guess. Alternatively, ""RABID"" is also possible. Let me pick ""RADIO"" as the next guess. Wait, but the secret word could have other letters. Alternatively, maybe ""RALLY"" but that has two L's. Hmm. Let me think again. The secret word must have R and A. So the next guess should include R and A, but in different positions. Let's try ""RALLY"". Wait, in ""RALLY"", R is in position 1, A is in position 3. But in the first guess, A was in position 3 (CRANE) and the feedback was A(-), meaning A is in the word but wrong position. So if in the next guess, A is in position 3 again, that would be wrong. So maybe the secret word has A in position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5. Similarly for R. So maybe ""RALLY"" would have R in position 1 (which is different from the first guess's position 2) and A in position 3 (same as first guess, which was wrong). So that would be a problem. So maybe ""RALLY"" is not a good choice. Alternatively, ""RABID"" has R in position 1 and A in position 2. That could be possible. Let me check if ""RABID"" is a valid word. Yes, it is. So maybe ""RABID"" is a good guess. Let me go with that.

Let me go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess. If the feedback comes back, I can adjust based on the symbols. But since I don\'t have any feedback yet, I just need to pick a word that\'s valid. Alternatively, maybe ""BRAVE"" is a good first guess because it\'s a common word with multiple letters that could be in the secret word. Hmm. But I need to make sure it\'s a valid 5-letter word. Both are valid. Let me pick ""CRANE"" as the first guess.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Okay, let\'s see.

So C is not in the word, R is in the word but in the wrong position, A is in the word but wrong position, N is not in the word, E is not in the word. Wait, no.

Alternatively, ""RANCH"" but N is excluded. Wait, N is excluded, so N can\'t be in the word. So ""RANCH"" is out because of N. So maybe ""RABID"" is possible. But let me check letters. R, A, B, I, D. But the secret word has R and A. So that\'s possible. Alternatively, ""RABAT"" but that\'s not a common word. Or ""RABID"". Alternatively, ""RADIO"" but that has O. Wait, but the secret word could have other letters. Let me think of a word that includes R and A, and doesn\'t have C, N, E. Let me try ""RABID"". But maybe ""RABAT"" is not a valid word. Alternatively, ""RALLY"" but that has L and Y. Alternatively, ""RASPY"" but that has P and Y. Hmm. Maybe ""RASPS"" but that has S and P. Alternatively, ""RASPS"" is a word. But I need to make sure that the letters are allowed. Since the secret word has R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3. So maybe the next guess could be ""RASPS"". Let\'s see. But I need to make sure that the letters are allowed. Alternatively, ""RABID"" is a valid word. Let me check: R, A, B, I, D. So that\'s a 5-letter word. But I need to make sure that the letters are allowed. Since the secret word has R and A, but not C, N, E. So maybe ""RABID"" is a possible guess. Alternatively, ""RABAT"" is not a valid word. Alternatively, ""RABID"" is better. Let me go with ""RABID"" as the next guess. But wait, maybe there\'s a better word. Alternatively, ""RASPY"" but that has P and Y. Let me think. Another approach: since the secret word has R and A, maybe the word is something like ""RADIO"" but that has O. But the secret word could have O. Let me check if O is allowed. Since in the first guess, O wasn\'t in CRANE, so O is allowed. So ""RADIO"" is a possible word. But that has R, A, D, I, O. So that\'s possible. But maybe ""RADIO"" is a better guess. Alternatively, ""RABID"" is also possible. Let me pick ""RADIO"" as the next guess. Wait, but the secret word could have other letters. Alternatively, maybe ""RALLY"" but that has two L\'s. Hmm. Let me think again. The secret word must have R and A. So the next guess should include R and A, but in different positions. Let\'s try ""RALLY"". Wait, in ""RALLY"", R is in position 1, A is in position 3. But in the first guess, A was in position 3 (CRANE) and the feedback was A(-), meaning A is in the word but wrong position. So if in the next guess, A is in position 3 again, that would be wrong. So maybe the secret word has A in position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5. Similarly for R. So maybe ""RALLY"" would have R in position 1 (which is different from the first guess\'s position 2) and A in position 3 (same as first guess, which was wrong). So that would be a problem. So maybe ""RALLY"" is not a good choice. Alternatively, ""RABID"" has R in position 1 and A in position 2. That could be possible. Let me check if ""RABID"" is a valid word. Yes, it is.

Okay, let's see. The previous guesses were CRANE and RABID. The feedback for CRANE was C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x). So that means R is in the word but not in position 2, A is in the word but not in position 3, and C, N, E are not in the word. Then, for RABID, the feedback was R(-), A(✓), B(x), I(x), D(x). So R is in the word but not in position 1 (since in RABID, R was in position 1, and the feedback is R(-)), meaning R is in the word but not in position 1. A is in the correct position? Wait, no. Wait, the feedback for A in RABID was A(✓). Wait, in the guess RABID, the letters are R, A, B, I, D. The feedback for A was ✓, which means A is in the word and in the correct position. Wait, but in the first feedback for CRANE, A was in position 3 (CRANE's third letter is A) and the feedback was A(-), meaning A is in the word but wrong position. Now, in the second guess, RABID, the A is in position 2. The feedback for A is ✓, which means A is in the correct position. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, no. Wait, the feedback for the second guess RABID: R(-) A(✓) B(x) I(x) D(x). So for the first letter R, it's R(-): R is in the word but wrong position. Wait, but in the first guess, CRANE had R in position 2, and the feedback was R(-), meaning R is in the word but wrong position. Now, in the second guess, R is in position 1, and the feedback is R(-), which again means R is in the word but not in position 1. So that's consistent. Then, for A in the second guess, it's A(✓), which means A is in the word and in the correct position. Wait, but in the first guess, A was in position 3 (CRANE) and the feedback was A(-), meaning A is in the word but wrong position. Now, in the second guess, A is in position 2, and the feedback is A(✓), meaning A is in the correct position. That would mean that the secret word has A in position 2. But that contradicts the first feedback, which said A was in the word but wrong position. Wait, that can't be. There must be a mistake here. Wait, no. Let me re-examine the feedback. 

First guess: CRANE. Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x). So for each letter:

C: not in word.

R: in word but wrong position (so R is in the word, but not in position 2).

A: in word but wrong position (so A is in the word, but not in position 3).

N: not in word.

E: not in word.

Second guess: RABID. Feedback: R(-) A(✓) B(x) I(x) D(x).

So for each letter:

R: in word but wrong position (so R is in the word, but not in position 1, since in RABID, R is in position 1. So the correct position for R is not 1. But from the first feedback, R is in the word but not in position 2. So R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But the second feedback says R is in the word but not in position 1. So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

A: in the word and correct position (position 2). So A is in position 2.

So that means the secret word has A in position 2, and R in positions 3, 4, or 5. Also, from the first feedback, A was in position 3 (CRANE) but wrong position, so A is in the word but not in position 3. Now, in the second guess, A is in position 2, and the feedback is ✓, meaning correct position. So that's correct. So the secret word has A in position 2.

So now, the secret word has A in position 2, and R in positions 3, 4, or 5. Also, the letters C, N, E are excluded. Also, B, I, D are excluded (from the second guess feedback: B(x), I(x), D(x)), so they are not in the word.

So the secret word is 5 letters, with A in position 2. The letters allowed are not C, N, E, B, I, D. So possible letters are F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But R is in the word, so R is allowed.

So the secret word has A in position 2, and R in positions 3, 4, or 5. Let's think of possible words. For example:

- R in position 3: So the word would be _ A R _ _. For example, ""STARS"" but that has S, T, A, R, S. But S is allowed. Wait, but in the second guess, the feedback for R was R(-), meaning R is in the word but not in position 1. So if R is in position 3, that's okay. But in the second guess, R was in position 1, which was wrong. So the secret word could have R in position 3. Let's think of words like ""STARs"" (but that's 5 letters). Wait, ""STARS"" is S-T-A-R-S. But that has R in position 4. Wait, no. S-T-A-R-S is positions 1-5: S (1), T (2), A (3), R (4), S (5). So A is in position 3, which conflicts with the feedback from the first guess. Wait, but in the first guess, A was in position 3 (CRANE) and the feedback was A(-), meaning A is in the word but wrong position. So if the secret word has A in position 3, that would be a problem. But from the second guess, we have A in position 2 (correct), so the secret word has A in position 2. So the secret word can't have A in position 3. So words like ""STARS"" would have A in position 3, which is invalid. So that's not possible. So the secret word must have A in position 2, and R in positions 3, 4, or 5.

So possible words could be:

- ""RASPS"": R-A-S-P-S. But that has R in position 1, which is not allowed (since R is in the word but not in position 1). Wait, no. Wait, the secret word has R in positions 3, 4, or 5. So ""RASPS"" would have R in position 1, which is not allowed. So that's invalid.

Another possibility: ""RASPY"" (R-A-S-P-Y). R is in position 1, which is invalid. So no. How about ""RASPS"" is invalid. What about ""RASPS"" is not allowed. Let's think of a word where R is in position 3. For example, ""SARAS"" (but that's not a word). Or ""SARAS"" is not valid. Maybe ""SARAS"" is not a word. Alternatively, ""SARAH"" but that has H. Wait, but the secret word can't have B, I, D, etc. So maybe ""SARAH"" is allowed. Let me check. S-A-R-A-H. But that has two A's. But the secret word has A in position 2, so that's okay. But the secret word can have other A's. However, the feedback from the first guess indicated that A is in the word but not in position 3. So if the secret word has A in position 2 and another A in position 4, that's allowed. But I'm not sure. Let me think of other words.

Another possibility: ""RASPS"" is invalid because R is in position 1. How about ""RASPS"" is not allowed. Maybe ""RASPS"" is not the right direction. Let's think of words with A in position 2 and R in position 3. For example, ""TARPS"" (T-A-R-P-S). But that has R in position 3. Let's check if that's possible. T-A-R-P-S. So letters are T, A, R, P, S. Are these letters allowed? T is allowed, A is in position 2, R is in position 3. The letters C, N, E, B, I, D are excluded. So T, A, R, P, S are all allowed. So ""TARPS"" is a possible word. Let's check if that's a valid word. Yes, ""tarps"" is a valid word. So that could be a candidate.

Alternatively, ""TRAPS"" (T-R-A-P-S). But that would have A in position 3, which is not allowed. Because the secret word has A in position 2. So ""TRAPS"" is invalid. So ""TARPS"" is better.

Another option: ""RASPS"" is invalid. What about ""RASPS"" is not allowed. How about ""RASPS"" is not. Maybe ""RASPS"" is not the right word. Alternatively, ""RASPS"" is invalid. Let me think of another word. ""RASPS"" is R-A-S-P-S. R is in position 1, which is invalid. So no.

What about ""RASPS"" is not allowed. How about ""RASPS"" is not. Maybe ""RASPS"" is not. Let me think of another word. ""RASPS"" is not. Maybe ""RASPS"" is not. Alternatively, ""RASPS"" is not. Maybe ""RASPS"" is not. Wait, maybe ""RASPS"" is not the right direction. Let me think of a word where R is in position 4. For example, ""SARAS"" (but not a word). Or ""SARAH"" (S-A-R-A-H). That's a valid word. So S-A-R-A-H. Letters are S, A, R, A, H. So A is in position 2 and 4. R is in position 3. That's allowed. So that's possible. But the secret word could be ""SARAH"". But I'm not sure. Alternatively, ""SARAH"" is a valid word. But I need to check if that's possible.

Alternatively, ""RASPS"" is not allowed. Maybe ""RASPS"" is not. So maybe ""TARPS"" is a better guess. Let's try that. So the next guess would be ""TARPS"". Let's see. The letters are T, A, R, P, S. Since A is in position 2 (correct), R is in position 3 (which is allowed, since the feedback for R in the second guess was R(-), meaning not in position 1. So R in position 3 is allowed. Then, the letters T, P, S are allowed. So that's a possible guess. Let me go with ""TARPS"" as the next guess.

But wait, the secret word could be ""RASPS"" but that's invalid. Alternatively, ""TARPS"" is a valid word. Let's check the feedback. If the secret word is ""TARPS"", then the feedback for ""TARPS"" would be:

T: is T in the secret word? If the secret word is TARPS, then T is in position 1. But in the first guess, T wasn't in CRANE. So T is allowed. The feedback for T would be: since T is in the secret word but in the guess TARPS, T is in position 1. If the secret word has T in position 1, then T would be correct. But the secret word could have T in position 1. However, from the first feedback, we don't know about T. So the feedback for T in the guess TARPS would be T(✓) if it's in the correct position, or T(-) if it's in the wrong position. But since we don't know, the guess is ""TARPS"". Let me proceed with that.

So R is in the word but not in position 1 (since in RABID, R was in position 1, and the feedback is R(-)), meaning R is in the word but not in position 1. A is in the correct position? Wait, no.

C: not in word.

R: in word but wrong position (so R is in the word, but not in position 2).

A: in word but wrong position (so A is in the word, but not in position 3).

N: not in word.

E: not in word.

Second guess: RABID. Feedback: R(-) A(✓) B(x) I(x) D(x).

So for each letter:

R: in word but wrong position (so R is in the word, but not in position 1, since in RABID, R is in position 1. So the correct position for R is not 1. But from the first feedback, R is in the word but not in position 2. So R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But the second feedback says R is in the word but not in position 1. So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

A: in the word and correct position (position 2). So A is in position 2.

So that means the secret word has A in position 2, and R in positions 3, 4, or 5. Also, from the first feedback, A was in position 3 (CRANE) but wrong position, so A is in the word but not in position 3. Now, in the second guess, A is in position 2, and the feedback is ✓, meaning correct position. So that's correct. So the secret word has A in position 2.

So now, the secret word has A in position 2, and R in positions 3, 4, or 5. Also, the letters C, N, E are excluded. Also, B, I, D are excluded (from the second guess feedback: B(x), I(x), D(x)), so they are not in the word.

So the secret word is 5 letters, with A in position 2. The letters allowed are not C, N, E, B, I, D. So possible letters are F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But R is in the word, so R is allowed.

But that has R in position 4. Wait, no. S-T-A-R-S is positions 1-5: S (1), T (2), A (3), R (4), S (5). So A is in position 3, which conflicts with the feedback from the first guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

Okay, let's see. I need to guess a 5-letter word. The secret word is somewhere in the list of possible 5-letter English words. Since I don't have any feedback yet, my first guess should be a word that's common and might have letters that are likely to be in the secret word. Maybe something like ""CRANE"" because it's a common word and has vowels that might be useful. Alternatively, ""STARS"" could be a good choice because it's common and has multiple letters that might be in the secret word. Wait, but I should pick a word that's more likely to have letters that are common in other words. Let me think. Maybe ""CRANE"" is better because it's a common word and has a mix of letters. Let me go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess. If the feedback comes back, I can adjust based on the symbols. But since I don't have any feedback yet, I just need to pick a word that's valid. Alternatively, maybe ""BRAVE"" is a good first guess because it's a common word with multiple letters that could be in the secret word. Hmm. But I need to make sure it's a valid 5-letter word. Both are valid. Let me pick ""CRANE"" as the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Okay, let's see. The first guess was CRANE, and the feedback was C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x). So that means none of the letters C, N, or E are in the secret word. Wait, no—wait, the feedback symbols: x means the letter is not in the word. So C is not in the word, R is in the word but in the wrong position, A is in the word but wrong position, N is not in the word, E is not in the word. Wait, no. Wait, the feedback for each letter is:

C(x): So C is not in the word.

R(-): R is in the word but in the wrong position.

A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position.

N(x): N is not in the word.

E(x): E is not in the word.

So from this, the secret word has R and A, but not in the positions they were in CRANE. Also, letters C, N, E are excluded.

So the secret word has R and A, but not in positions 1 and 3 (since in CRANE, R was in position 2 and A in position 3). So R is in the word but not in position 2, and A is in the word but not in position 3.

So possible letters: R and A are present. Also, the secret word is 5 letters, so we need three more letters. Also, letters C, N, E are excluded. So possible letters could be other letters.

So next guess needs to include R and A, but in different positions. Also, avoid C, N, E.

Let me think of words that have R and A. For example, ""RARES"" but that has two R's. Or ""ARISE"" but that has an S and I. Wait, but the secret word could have other letters. Let me think of possible words. Maybe ""RABID"" but that has a D and I. Or ""RALLY"" but that has two L's. Alternatively, ""RANCH"" but N is excluded. Wait, N is excluded, so N can't be in the word. So ""RANCH"" is out because of N. So maybe ""RABID"" is possible. But let me check letters. R, A, B, I, D. But the secret word has R and A. So that's possible. Alternatively, ""RABAT"" but that's not a common word. Or ""RABID"". Alternatively, ""RADIO"" but that has O. Wait, but the secret word could have other letters. Let me think of a word that includes R and A, and doesn't have C, N, E. Let me try ""RABID"". But maybe ""RABAT"" is not a valid word. Alternatively, ""RALLY"" but that has L and Y. Alternatively, ""RASPY"" but that has P and Y. Hmm. Maybe ""RASPS"" but that has S and P. Alternatively, ""RASPS"" is a word. But I need to make sure that the letters are allowed. Since the secret word has R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3. So maybe the next guess could be ""RASPS"". Let's see. But I need to make sure that the letters are allowed. Alternatively, ""RABID"" is a valid word. Let me check: R, A, B, I, D. So that's a 5-letter word. But I need to make sure that the letters are allowed. Since the secret word has R and A, but not C, N, E. So maybe ""RABID"" is a possible guess. Alternatively, ""RABAT"" is not a valid word. Alternatively, ""RABID"" is better. Let me go with ""RABID"" as the next guess. But wait, maybe there's a better word. Alternatively, ""RASPY"" but that has P and Y. Let me think. Another approach: since the secret word has R and A, maybe the word is something like ""RADIO"" but that has O. But the secret word could have O. Let me check if O is allowed. Since in the first guess, O wasn't in CRANE, so O is allowed. So ""RADIO"" is a possible word. But that has R, A, D, I, O. So that's possible. But maybe ""RADIO"" is a better guess. Alternatively, ""RABID"" is also possible. Let me pick ""RADIO"" as the next guess. Wait, but the secret word could have other letters. Alternatively, maybe ""RALLY"" but that has two L's. Hmm. Let me think again. The secret word must have R and A. So the next guess should include R and A, but in different positions. Let's try ""RALLY"". Wait, in ""RALLY"", R is in position 1, A is in position 3. But in the first guess, A was in position 3 (CRANE) and the feedback was A(-), meaning A is in the word but wrong position. So if in the next guess, A is in position 3 again, that would be wrong. So maybe the secret word has A in position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5. Similarly for R. So maybe ""RALLY"" would have R in position 1 (which is different from the first guess's position 2) and A in position 3 (same as first guess, which was wrong). So that would be a problem. So maybe ""RALLY"" is not a good choice. Alternatively, ""RABID"" has R in position 1 and A in position 2. That could be possible. Let me check if ""RABID"" is a valid word. Yes, it is. So maybe ""RABID"" is a good guess. Let me go with that.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RABID -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) B(x) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Okay, let's see. The previous guesses were CRANE and RABID. The feedback for CRANE was C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x). So that means R is in the word but not in position 2, A is in the word but not in position 3, and C, N, E are not in the word. Then, for RABID, the feedback was R(-), A(✓), B(x), I(x), D(x). So R is in the word but not in position 1 (since in RABID, R was in position 1, and the feedback is R(-)), meaning R is in the word but not in position 1. A is in the correct position? Wait, no. Wait, the feedback for A in RABID was A(✓). Wait, in the guess RABID, the letters are R, A, B, I, D. The feedback for A was ✓, which means A is in the word and in the correct position. Wait, but in the first feedback for CRANE, A was in position 3 (CRANE's third letter is A) and the feedback was A(-), meaning A is in the word but wrong position. Now, in the second guess, RABID, the A is in position 2. The feedback for A is ✓, which means A is in the correct position. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, no. Wait, the feedback for the second guess RABID: R(-) A(✓) B(x) I(x) D(x). So for the first letter R, it's R(-): R is in the word but wrong position. Wait, but in the first guess, CRANE had R in position 2, and the feedback was R(-), meaning R is in the word but wrong position. Now, in the second guess, R is in position 1, and the feedback is R(-), which again means R is in the word but not in position 1. So that's consistent. Then, for A in the second guess, it's A(✓), which means A is in the word and in the correct position. Wait, but in the first guess, A was in position 3 (CRANE) and the feedback was A(-), meaning A is in the word but wrong position. Now, in the second guess, A is in position 2, and the feedback is A(✓), meaning A is in the correct position. That would mean that the secret word has A in position 2. But that contradicts the first feedback, which said A was in the word but wrong position. Wait, that can't be. There must be a mistake here. Wait, no. Let me re-examine the feedback. 

First guess: CRANE. Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x). So for each letter:

C: not in word.

R: in word but wrong position (so R is in the word, but not in position 2).

A: in word but wrong position (so A is in the word, but not in position 3).

N: not in word.

E: not in word.

Second guess: RABID. Feedback: R(-) A(✓) B(x) I(x) D(x).

So for each letter:

R: in word but wrong position (so R is in the word, but not in position 1, since in RABID, R is in position 1. So the correct position for R is not 1. But from the first feedback, R is in the word but not in position 2. So R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. But the second feedback says R is in the word but not in position 1. So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

A: in the word and correct position (position 2). So A is in position 2.

So that means the secret word has A in position 2, and R in positions 3, 4, or 5. Also, from the first feedback, A was in position 3 (CRANE) but wrong position, so A is in the word but not in position 3. Now, in the second guess, A is in position 2, and the feedback is ✓, meaning correct position. So that's correct. So the secret word has A in position 2.

So now, the secret word has A in position 2, and R in positions 3, 4, or 5. Also, the letters C, N, E are excluded. Also, B, I, D are excluded (from the second guess feedback: B(x), I(x), D(x)), so they are not in the word.

So the secret word is 5 letters, with A in position 2. The letters allowed are not C, N, E, B, I, D. So possible letters are F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But R is in the word, so R is allowed.

So the secret word has A in position 2, and R in positions 3, 4, or 5. Let's think of possible words. For example:

- R in position 3: So the word would be _ A R _ _. For example, ""STARS"" but that has S, T, A, R, S. But S is allowed. Wait, but in the second guess, the feedback for R was R(-), meaning R is in the word but not in position 1. So if R is in position 3, that's okay. But in the second guess, R was in position 1, which was wrong. So the secret word could have R in position 3. Let's think of words like ""STARs"" (but that's 5 letters). Wait, ""STARS"" is S-T-A-R-S. But that has R in position 4. Wait, no. S-T-A-R-S is positions 1-5: S (1), T (2), A (3), R (4), S (5). So A is in position 3, which conflicts with the feedback from the first guess. Wait, but in the first guess, A was in position 3 (CRANE) and the feedback was A(-), meaning A is in the word but wrong position. So if the secret word has A in position 3, that would be a problem. But from the second guess, we have A in position 2 (correct), so the secret word has A in position 2. So the secret word can't have A in position 3. So words like ""STARS"" would have A in position 3, which is invalid. So that's not possible. So the secret word must have A in position 2, and R in positions 3, 4, or 5.

So possible words could be:

- ""RASPS"": R-A-S-P-S. But that has R in position 1, which is not allowed (since R is in the word but not in position 1). Wait, no. Wait, the secret word has R in positions 3, 4, or 5. So ""RASPS"" would have R in position 1, which is not allowed. So that's invalid.

Another possibility: ""RASPY"" (R-A-S-P-Y). R is in position 1, which is invalid. So no. How about ""RASPS"" is invalid. What about ""RASPS"" is not allowed. Let's think of a word where R is in position 3. For example, ""SARAS"" (but that's not a word). Or ""SARAS"" is not valid. Maybe ""SARAS"" is not a word. Alternatively, ""SARAH"" but that has H. Wait, but the secret word can't have B, I, D, etc. So maybe ""SARAH"" is allowed. Let me check. S-A-R-A-H. But that has two A's. But the secret word has A in position 2, so that's okay. But the secret word can have other A's. However, the feedback from the first guess indicated that A is in the word but not in position 3. So if the secret word has A in position 2 and another A in position 4, that's allowed. But I'm not sure. Let me think of other words.

Another possibility: ""RASPS"" is invalid because R is in position 1. How about ""RASPS"" is not allowed. Maybe ""RASPS"" is not the right direction. Let's think of words with A in position 2 and R in position 3. For example, ""TARPS"" (T-A-R-P-S). But that has R in position 3. Let's check if that's possible. T-A-R-P-S. So letters are T, A, R, P, S. Are these letters allowed? T is allowed, A is in position 2, R is in position 3. The letters C, N, E, B, I, D are excluded. So T, A, R, P, S are all allowed. So ""TARPS"" is a possible word. Let's check if that's a valid word. Yes, ""tarps"" is a valid word. So that could be a candidate.

Alternatively, ""TRAPS"" (T-R-A-P-S). But that would have A in position 3, which is not allowed. Because the secret word has A in position 2. So ""TRAPS"" is invalid. So ""TARPS"" is better.

Another option: ""RASPS"" is invalid. What about ""RASPS"" is not allowed. How about ""RASPS"" is not. Maybe ""RASPS"" is not the right word. Alternatively, ""RASPS"" is invalid. Let me think of another word. ""RASPS"" is R-A-S-P-S. R is in position 1, which is invalid. So no.

What about ""RASPS"" is not allowed. How about ""RASPS"" is not. Maybe ""RASPS"" is not. Let me think of another word. ""RASPS"" is not. Maybe ""RASPS"" is not. Alternatively, ""RASPS"" is not. Maybe ""RASPS"" is not. Wait, maybe ""RASPS"" is not the right direction. Let me think of a word where R is in position 4. For example, ""SARAS"" (but not a word). Or ""SARAH"" (S-A-R-A-H). That's a valid word. So S-A-R-A-H. Letters are S, A, R, A, H. So A is in position 2 and 4. R is in position 3. That's allowed. So that's possible. But the secret word could be ""SARAH"". But I'm not sure. Alternatively, ""SARAH"" is a valid word. But I need to check if that's possible.

Alternatively, ""RASPS"" is not allowed. Maybe ""RASPS"" is not. So maybe ""TARPS"" is a better guess. Let's try that. So the next guess would be ""TARPS"". Let's see. The letters are T, A, R, P, S. Since A is in position 2 (correct), R is in position 3 (which is allowed, since the feedback for R in the second guess was R(-), meaning not in position 1. So R in position 3 is allowed. Then, the letters T, P, S are allowed. So that's a possible guess. Let me go with ""TARPS"" as the next guess.

But wait, the secret word could be ""RASPS"" but that's invalid. Alternatively, ""TARPS"" is a valid word. Let's check the feedback. If the secret word is ""TARPS"", then the feedback for ""TARPS"" would be:

T: is T in the secret word? If the secret word is TARPS, then T is in position 1. But in the first guess, T wasn't in CRANE. So T is allowed. The feedback for T would be: since T is in the secret word but in the guess TARPS, T is in position 1. If the secret word has T in position 1, then T would be correct. But the secret word could have T in position 1. However, from the first feedback, we don't know about T. So the feedback for T in the guess TARPS would be T(✓) if it's in the correct position, or T(-) if it's in the wrong position. But since we don't know, the guess is ""TARPS"". Let me proceed with that.

But the second feedback says R is in the word but not in position 1. So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n\nA: in the word and correct position (position 2). So A is in position 2.\n\nSo that means the secret word has A in position 2, and R in positions 3, 4, or 5. Also, from the first feedback, A was in position 3 (CRANE) but wrong position, so A is in the word but not in position 3. Now, in the second guess, A is in position 2, and the feedback is ✓, meaning correct position. So that\'s correct. So the secret word has A in position 2.\n\nSo now, the secret word has A in position 2, and R in positions 3, 4, or 5. Also, the letters C, N, E are excluded. Also, B, I, D are excluded (from the second guess feedback: B(x), I(x), D(x)), so they are not in the word.\n\nSo the secret word is 5 letters, with A in position 2.

But R is in the word, so R is allowed.\n\nSo the secret word has A in position 2, and R in positions 3, 4, or 5. Let\'s think of possible words. For example:\n\n- R in position 3: So the word would be _ A R _ _. For example, ""STARS"" but that has S, T, A, R, S. But S is allowed. Wait, but in the second guess, the feedback for R was R(-), meaning R is in the word but not in position 1. So if R is in position 3, that\'s okay. But in the second guess, R was in position 1, which was wrong. So the secret word could have R in position 3. Let\'s think of words like ""STARs"" (but that\'s 5 letters). Wait, ""STARS"" is S-T-A-R-S. But that has R in position 4. Wait, no. S-T-A-R-S is positions 1-5: S (1), T (2), A (3), R (4), S (5). So A is in position 3, which conflicts with the feedback from the first guess. Wait, but in the first guess, A was in position 3 (CRANE) and the feedback was A(-), meaning A is in the word but wrong position. So if the secret word has A in position 3, that would be a problem. But from the second guess, we have A in position 2 (correct), so the secret word has A in position 2. So the secret word can\'t have A in position 3. So words like ""STARS"" would have A in position 3, which is invalid. So that\'s not possible. So the secret word must have A in position 2, and R in positions 3, 4, or 5.\n\nSo possible words could be:\n\n- ""RASPS"": R-A-S-P-S. But that has R in position 1, which is not allowed (since R is in the word but not in position 1). Wait, no. Wait, the secret word has R in positions 3, 4, or 5. So ""RASPS"" would have R in position 1, which is not allowed. So that\'s invalid.\n\nAnother possibility: ""RASPY"" (R-A-S-P-Y). R is in position 1, which is invalid. So no. How about ""RASPS"" is invalid. What about ""RASPS"" is not allowed. Let\'s think of a word where R is in position 3. For example, ""SARAS"" (but that\'s not a word). Or ""SARAS"" is not valid. Maybe ""SARAS"" is not a word. Alternatively, ""SARAH"" but that has H. Wait, but the secret word can\'t have B, I, D, etc. So maybe ""SARAH"" is allowed. Let me check. S-A-R-A-H. But that has two A\'s. But the secret word has A in position 2, so that\'s okay. But the secret word can have other A\'s. However, the feedback from the first guess indicated that A is in the word but not in position 3. So if the secret word has A in position 2 and another A in position 4, that\'s allowed. But I\'m not sure. Let me think of other words.\n\nAnother possibility: ""RASPS"" is invalid because R is in position 1. How about ""RASPS"" is not allowed. Maybe ""RASPS"" is not the right direction. Let\'s think of words with A in position 2 and R in position 3. For example, ""TARPS"" (T-A-R-P-S). But that has R in position 3. Let\'s check if that\'s possible. T-A-R-P-S. So letters are T, A, R, P, S. Are these letters allowed? T is allowed, A is in position 2, R is in position 3. The letters C, N, E, B, I, D are excluded. So T, A, R, P, S are all allowed. So ""TARPS"" is a possible word. Let\'s check if that\'s a valid word. Yes, ""tarps"" is a valid word. So that could be a candidate.\n\nAlternatively, ""TRAPS"" (T-R-A-P-S). But that would have A in position 3, which is not allowed. Because the secret word has A in position 2. So ""TRAPS"" is invalid. So ""TARPS"" is better.\n\nAnother option: ""RASPS"" is invalid. What about ""RASPS"" is not allowed. How about ""RASPS"" is not. Maybe ""RASPS"" is not the right word. Alternatively, ""RASPS"" is invalid. Let me think of another word. ""RASPS"" is R-A-S-P-S. R is in position 1, which is invalid. So no.\n\nWhat about ""RASPS"" is not allowed. How about ""RASPS"" is not. Maybe ""RASPS"" is not. Let me think of another word. ""RASPS"" is not. Maybe ""RASPS"" is not. Alternatively, ""RASPS"" is not. Maybe ""RASPS"" is not. Wait, maybe ""RASPS"" is not the right direction. Let me think of a word where R is in position 4. For example, ""SARAS"" (but not a word). Or ""SARAH"" (S-A-R-A-H). That\'s a valid word. So S-A-R-A-H. Letters are S, A, R, A, H. So A is in position 2 and 4. R is in position 3. That\'s allowed. So that\'s possible. But the secret word could be ""SARAH"". But I\'m not sure. Alternatively, ""SARAH"" is a valid word. But I need to check if that\'s possible.\n\nAlternatively, ""RASPS"" is not allowed. Maybe ""RASPS"" is not. So maybe ""TARPS"" is a better guess. Let\'s try that. So the next guess would be ""TARPS"". Let\'s see. The letters are T, A, R, P, S. Since A is in position 2 (correct), R is in position 3 (which is allowed, since the feedback for R in the second guess was R(-), meaning not in position 1. So R in position 3 is allowed. Then, the letters T, P, S are allowed. So that\'s a possible guess. Let me go with ""TARPS"" as the next guess.\n\nBut wait, the secret word could be ""RASPS"" but that\'s invalid. Alternatively, ""TARPS"" is a valid word. Let\'s check the feedback. If the secret word is ""TARPS"", then the feedback for ""TARPS"" would be:\n\nT: is T in the secret word? If the secret word is TARPS, then T is in position 1. But in the first guess, T wasn\'t in CRANE. So T is allowed. The feedback for T would be: since T is in the secret word but in the guess TARPS, T is in position 1. If the secret word has T in position 1, then T would be correct. But the secret word could have T in position 1. However, from the first feedback, we don\'t know about T. So the feedback for T in the guess TARPS would be T(✓) if it\'s in the correct position, or T(-) if it\'s in the wrong position. But since we don\'t know, the guess is ""TARPS"". Let me proceed with that.\n\n<guess>TARPS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: RABID -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) B(x) I(x) D(x)\nGuess 3: TARPS -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) R(✓) P(x) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the secret word based on the feedback from the previous guesses. Let me start by going through each guess and their feedback step by step.

First, the first guess was CRANE. The feedback was C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x). That means:
- C is not in the word.
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (so R is present, but not in position 2).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is present, but not in position 3).
- N and E are not in the word.

Second guess was RABID. The feedback was R(-), A(✓), B(x), I(x), D(x). So:
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (since in RABID, R was in position 1, and the feedback is R(-), meaning it's not in that position).
- A is in the correct position (position 2).
- B, I, D are not in the word.

Third guess was TARPS. The feedback was T(x), A(✓), R(✓), P(x), S(x). So:
- T is not in the word.
- A is in the correct position (position 2, which matches the previous feedback that A is in position 2).
- R is in the correct position (position 3). Wait, but in the second guess, R was in position 1 and the feedback was R(-), meaning R is in the word but not in position 1. Now, in the third guess, R is in position 3 and the feedback is R(✓), meaning R is in the correct position. So that means R is in position 3. So the secret word has R in position 3.

So putting this together:
- A is in position 2.
- R is in position 3.
- T is not in the word (from third guess feedback).
- P and S are not in the word (from third guess feedback).
- B, I, D are not in the word (from second guess feedback).
- C, N, E are not in the word (from first guess feedback).

So the secret word has letters in positions:
1: ?
2: A
3: R
4: ?
5: ?

Possible letters for positions 1, 4, 5. The letters allowed are those not excluded: letters not in {C, N, E, B, I, D, T, P, S}. So allowed letters are F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But also, the secret word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

So positions 1, 4, 5 need to be filled with letters from the allowed set. Let's think of possible words. Since position 2 is A and position 3 is R, the word structure is _ A R _ _.

Possible words could be:
- ""FARMS"" but S is excluded (from third guess feedback, S(x)), so no.
- ""FARAD"" but D is excluded (from second guess feedback D(x)), so no.
- ""FAROE"" but E is excluded (from first guess feedback E(x)), so no.
- ""FAROW"" but not sure if that's a word.
- ""FARAD"" is invalid because D is excluded.
- ""FARER"" but that's not a valid word.
- ""FARER"" is not valid. Maybe ""FARER"" is a word? Not sure.
- ""FARER"" might not be valid. Let's think of other options.

Another possibility: ""FARMS"" is invalid because S is excluded. How about ""FARMS"" is not allowed. What about ""FARER""? Maybe not. Alternatively, ""FARER"" is not a valid word. Let's think of other letters. Maybe ""FARLY"" but that's not a standard word. ""FARLY"" is not valid. How about ""FARLY"" is not. Maybe ""FARLY"" is not. Alternatively, ""FARLY"" is not. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""FARER""? Let me check if that's a valid word. ""Farer"" is a word meaning someone who travels by far. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe ""FARER"" is not a common word. Alternatively, ""FARER"" might be a valid word. If that's the case, then the word would be F-A-R-E-R. But E is excluded (from first guess feedback E(x)), so E can't be in the word. So that's invalid. So E is excluded.

Another possibility: ""FARLY"" is not valid. What about ""FARER"" is not. Maybe ""FARER"" is not. Let's think of other letters. Maybe ""FARLY"" is not. How about ""FARER"" is not. Let me think of other letters. Maybe ""FARLY"" is not. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FARER"" but with E excluded. Wait, no. E is excluded, so E can't be in the word.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FARER"" but that's not allowed. Let me think again. The allowed letters for positions 1, 4, 5 are F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. So maybe the secret word is ""FARLY"" but that's not valid. Alternatively, ""FARLY"" is not. What about ""FARLY"" is not. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""FARER"" but with E excluded. No, E is excluded, so that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FARER"" but that's not allowed. Let me think of another approach. Since the secret word has A in position 2 and R in position 3, maybe the word is ""SARAS"" but that's not valid. Or ""SARAH"" which is S-A-R-A-H. That would have A in position 2 and 4, R in position 3. But the secret word could have two A's. However, the first guess had A in position 3 (CRANE) and the feedback was A(-), meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. So if the secret word has A in position 4, that's allowed. So ""SARAH"" would be S-A-R-A-H. Let's check if that's a valid word. Yes, ""SARAH"" is a valid name. But is it considered a valid English word? It's a proper noun, but sometimes in word games, proper nouns are allowed. If that's acceptable, then ""SARAH"" could be the secret word. However, I need to check if the letters are allowed. S is allowed (since in the third guess, S(x) means S is not in the word. Wait, third guess was TARPS, and the feedback for S was S(x), meaning S is not in the word. So S can't be in the secret word. Therefore, ""SARAH"" has S in position 1, which is not allowed. So that's invalid.

So that's not possible. So the secret word can't have S. So maybe ""FARER"" is not allowed. Let me think again. The allowed letters for positions 1, 4, 5 are F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Let's think of a word that fits _ A R _ _. For example, ""FARLY"" is not valid. How about ""FARLY"" is not. ""FARLY"" is not a word. What about ""FARLY"" is not. Alternatively, ""FARLY"" is not. Maybe ""FARLY"" is not. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""FARER"" but that's not allowed. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FARER"" but with E excluded. No, E is excluded. So that's not possible. Let me think of other possibilities. Maybe ""FARLY"" is not. What about ""FARLY"" is not. Alternatively, ""FARLY"" is not. Maybe the secret word is ""FARER"" but with E excluded. No. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FARLY"" but that's not valid. This is tricky. Maybe I need to think of other words. Let's think of words that have A in position 2 and R in position 3. For example, ""FARER"" is not valid. How about ""FARER"" is not. Maybe ""FARER"" is not. Alternatively, ""FARER"" is not. Maybe ""FARER"" is not. Wait, what about ""FARER"" is not. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FARER"" but that's not allowed. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FARER"" but that's not valid. Wait, maybe the secret word is ""FARER"" but that's not valid. Let me think of other letters. For example, position 1 could be ""M"", so the word is M A R _ _. Maybe ""MARCH"" but that has C which is excluded. No. ""MARCH"" is invalid. ""MARES"" but that has S which is excluded. No. ""MARES"" is invalid. How about ""MARES"" is invalid. ""MARES"" has S, which is excluded. So no. How about ""MARES"" is invalid. ""MARES"" is not allowed.

Another possibility: position 1 is ""L"", so the word is L A R _ _. Maybe ""LARVA"" but that has V and A in position 5. But the secret word has A in position 2. So ""LARVA"" would be L-A-R-V-A. That has A in position 2 and 5. But the secret word could have A in position 5. However, the first guess's feedback said A is in the word but not in position 3. So A in position 5 is allowed. But the secret word would be LARVA. However, the third guess was TARPS, and the feedback for P was P(x), so P is not in the word. But in LARVA, there's no P, so that's okay. But is ""LARVA"" a valid word? Yes. So that's possible. Let's check the letters: L, A, R, V, A. Are all letters allowed? L is allowed (not excluded), A is allowed, R is allowed, V is allowed (since V is not in the excluded list), and A is allowed. So ""LARVA"" is a valid word. But wait, the secret word has A in position 2 and 5. But the first guess's feedback said A is in the word but not in position 3. So that's allowed. So ""LARVA"" could be the secret word. But the third guess was TARPS, and the feedback for T was T(x), so T is not in the word. In ""LARVA"", there's no T, so that's okay. Also, the third guess's feedback for P was P(x), so P is not in the word. ""LARVA"" has no P, so that's okay. So ""LARVA"" is a possible candidate.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""LARVA"". Let me check if that's the case. But I need to make sure that all the feedbacks are consistent. Let's check:

First guess: CRANE. Secret word is LARVA. So letters in CRANE are C, R, A, N, E. The secret word has R (position 3), A (position 2), and others. So the feedback for CRANE would be C(x), R(-) (since R is in the word but not in position 2), A(-) (since A is in the word but not in position 3), N(x), E(x). Which matches the first feedback.

Second guess: RABID. Secret word is LARVA. Letters in RABID are R, A, B, I, D. The secret word has R (position 3), A (position 2), and no B, I, D. So the feedback would be R(-) (R is in the word but not in position 1), A(✓) (A is in position 2), B(x), I(x), D(x). Which matches the second feedback.

Third guess: TARPS. Secret word is LARVA. Letters in TARPS are T, A, R, P, S. The secret word has A (position 2), R (position 3), but no T, P, S. So the feedback would be T(x), A(✓), R(✓), P(x), S(x). Which matches the third feedback.

So that works. Therefore, the secret word is likely ""LARVA"". But wait, ""LARVA"" is a valid word. However, I need to check if there are other possibilities. Another possible word could be ""FARER"" but that's not valid. Or ""FARLY"" is not. Alternatively, ""LARVA"" is the correct answer. So the next guess should be ""LARVA"". But wait, the user might have a different secret word. Let me think again. Are there other words that fit the criteria?

Another possibility: ""FARER"" is not valid. ""FARER"" is not a standard word. ""FARLY"" is not. ""FARER"" is not. ""FARER"" is not. How about ""FARER"" is not. Alternatively, ""FARER"" is not. Maybe ""FARER"" is not. So ""LARVA"" seems like the best fit. Therefore, the next guess should be ""LARVA"". But wait, the user might have a different secret word. Let me think again. Are there other words that fit the structure _ A R _ _ with the allowed letters?

Another possibility: ""FARER"" is not valid. ""FARER"" is not. How about ""FARLY"" is not. ""FARLY"" is not. ""FARLY"" is not. Maybe ""FARER"" is not. Alternatively, ""FARER"" is not. So ""LARVA"" seems to be the only valid word that fits. Therefore, the next guess should be ""LARVA"".

But wait, the user might have a different word. Let me think of another possibility. What about ""FARER""? If it's allowed, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, ""FARER"" is not. So I think ""LARVA"" is the correct answer.

<guess>LARVA</guess>",LARVA,"Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the secret word based on the feedback from the previous guesses. Let me start by going through each guess and their feedback step by step.

First, the first guess was CRANE. The feedback was C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x). That means:
- C is not in the word.
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (so R is present, but not in position 2).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is present, but not in position 3).
- N and E are not in the word.

Second guess was RABID. The feedback was R(-), A(✓), B(x), I(x), D(x). So:
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (since in RABID, R was in position 1, and the feedback is R(-), meaning it's not in that position).
- A is in the correct position (position 2).
- B, I, D are not in the word.

Third guess was TARPS. The feedback was T(x), A(✓), R(✓), P(x), S(x). So:
- T is not in the word.
- A is in the correct position (position 2, which matches the previous feedback that A is in position 2).
- R is in the correct position (position 3). Wait, but in the second guess, R was in position 1 and the feedback was R(-), meaning R is in the word but not in position 1. Now, in the third guess, R is in position 3 and the feedback is R(✓), meaning R is in the correct position. So that means R is in position 3. So the secret word has R in position 3.

So putting this together:
- A is in position 2.
- R is in position 3.
- T is not in the word (from third guess feedback).
- P and S are not in the word (from third guess feedback).
- B, I, D are not in the word (from second guess feedback).
- C, N, E are not in the word (from first guess feedback).

So the secret word has letters in positions:
1: ?
2: A
3: R
4: ?
5: ?

Possible letters for positions 1, 4, 5. The letters allowed are those not excluded: letters not in {C, N, E, B, I, D, T, P, S}. So allowed letters are F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But also, the secret word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

So positions 1, 4, 5 need to be filled with letters from the allowed set. Let's think of possible words. Since position 2 is A and position 3 is R, the word structure is _ A R _ _.

Possible words could be:
- ""FARMS"" but S is excluded (from third guess feedback, S(x)), so no.
- ""FARAD"" but D is excluded (from second guess feedback D(x)), so no.
- ""FAROE"" but E is excluded (from first guess feedback E(x)), so no.
- ""FAROW"" but not sure if that's a word.
- ""FARAD"" is invalid because D is excluded.
- ""FARER"" but that's not a valid word.
- ""FARER"" is not valid. Maybe ""FARER"" is a word? Not sure.
- ""FARER"" might not be valid. Let's think of other options.

Another possibility: ""FARMS"" is invalid because S is excluded. How about ""FARMS"" is not allowed. What about ""FARER""? Maybe not. Alternatively, ""FARER"" is not a valid word. Let's think of other letters. Maybe ""FARLY"" but that's not a standard word. ""FARLY"" is not valid. How about ""FARLY"" is not. Maybe ""FARLY"" is not. Alternatively, ""FARLY"" is not. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""FARER""? Let me check if that's a valid word. ""Farer"" is a word meaning someone who travels by far. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe ""FARER"" is not a common word. Alternatively, ""FARER"" might be a valid word. If that's the case, then the word would be F-A-R-E-R. But E is excluded (from first guess feedback E(x)), so E can't be in the word. So that's invalid. So E is excluded.

Another possibility: ""FARLY"" is not valid. What about ""FARER"" is not. Maybe ""FARER"" is not. Let's think of other letters. Maybe ""FARLY"" is not. How about ""FARER"" is not. Let me think of other letters. Maybe ""FARLY"" is not. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FARER"" but with E excluded. Wait, no. E is excluded, so E can't be in the word.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FARER"" but that's not allowed. Let me think again. The allowed letters for positions 1, 4, 5 are F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. So maybe the secret word is ""FARLY"" but that's not valid. Alternatively, ""FARLY"" is not. What about ""FARLY"" is not. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""FARER"" but with E excluded. No, E is excluded, so that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FARER"" but that's not allowed. Let me think of another approach. Since the secret word has A in position 2 and R in position 3, maybe the word is ""SARAS"" but that's not valid. Or ""SARAH"" which is S-A-R-A-H. That would have A in position 2 and 4, R in position 3. But the secret word could have two A's. However, the first guess had A in position 3 (CRANE) and the feedback was A(-), meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. So if the secret word has A in position 4, that's allowed. So ""SARAH"" would be S-A-R-A-H. Let's check if that's a valid word. Yes, ""SARAH"" is a valid name. But is it considered a valid English word? It's a proper noun, but sometimes in word games, proper nouns are allowed. If that's acceptable, then ""SARAH"" could be the secret word. However, I need to check if the letters are allowed. S is allowed (since in the third guess, S(x) means S is not in the word. Wait, third guess was TARPS, and the feedback for S was S(x), meaning S is not in the word. So S can't be in the secret word. Therefore, ""SARAH"" has S in position 1, which is not allowed. So that's invalid.

So that's not possible. So the secret word can't have S. So maybe ""FARER"" is not allowed. Let me think again. The allowed letters for positions 1, 4, 5 are F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Let's think of a word that fits _ A R _ _. For example, ""FARLY"" is not valid. How about ""FARLY"" is not. ""FARLY"" is not a word. What about ""FARLY"" is not. Alternatively, ""FARLY"" is not. Maybe ""FARLY"" is not. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""FARER"" but that's not allowed. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FARER"" but with E excluded. No, E is excluded. So that's not possible. Let me think of other possibilities. Maybe ""FARLY"" is not. What about ""FARLY"" is not. Alternatively, ""FARLY"" is not. Maybe the secret word is ""FARER"" but with E excluded. No. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FARLY"" but that's not valid. This is tricky. Maybe I need to think of other words. Let's think of words that have A in position 2 and R in position 3. For example, ""FARER"" is not valid. How about ""FARER"" is not. Maybe ""FARER"" is not. Alternatively, ""FARER"" is not. Maybe ""FARER"" is not. Wait, what about ""FARER"" is not. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FARER"" but that's not allowed. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""FARER"" but that's not valid. Wait, maybe the secret word is ""FARER"" but that's not valid. Let me think of other letters. For example, position 1 could be ""M"", so the word is M A R _ _. Maybe ""MARCH"" but that has C which is excluded. No. ""MARCH"" is invalid. ""MARES"" but that has S which is excluded. No. ""MARES"" is invalid. How about ""MARES"" is invalid. ""MARES"" has S, which is excluded. So no. How about ""MARES"" is invalid. ""MARES"" is not allowed.

Another possibility: position 1 is ""L"", so the word is L A R _ _. Maybe ""LARVA"" but that has V and A in position 5. But the secret word has A in position 2. So ""LARVA"" would be L-A-R-V-A. That has A in position 2 and 5. But the secret word could have A in position 5. However, the first guess's feedback said A is in the word but not in position 3. So A in position 5 is allowed. But the secret word would be LARVA. However, the third guess was TARPS, and the feedback for P was P(x), so P is not in the word. But in LARVA, there's no P, so that's okay. But is ""LARVA"" a valid word? Yes. So that's possible. Let's check the letters: L, A, R, V, A. Are all letters allowed? L is allowed (not excluded), A is allowed, R is allowed, V is allowed (since V is not in the excluded list), and A is allowed. So ""LARVA"" is a valid word. But wait, the secret word has A in position 2 and 5. But the first guess's feedback said A is in the word but not in position 3. So that's allowed. So ""LARVA"" could be the secret word. But the third guess was TARPS, and the feedback for T was T(x), so T is not in the word. In ""LARVA"", there's no T, so that's okay. Also, the third guess's feedback for P was P(x), so P is not in the word. ""LARVA"" has no P, so that's okay. So ""LARVA"" is a possible candidate.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""LARVA"". Let me check if that's the case. But I need to make sure that all the feedbacks are consistent. Let's check:

First guess: CRANE. Secret word is LARVA. So letters in CRANE are C, R, A, N, E. The secret word has R (position 3), A (position 2), and others. So the feedback for CRANE would be C(x), R(-) (since R is in the word but not in position 2), A(-) (since A is in the word but not in position 3), N(x), E(x). Which matches the first feedback.

Second guess: RABID. Secret word is LARVA. Letters in RABID are R, A, B, I, D. The secret word has R (position 3), A (position 2), and no B, I, D. So the feedback would be R(-) (R is in the word but not in position 1), A(✓) (A is in position 2), B(x), I(x), D(x). Which matches the second feedback.

Third guess: TARPS. Secret word is LARVA. Letters in TARPS are T, A, R, P, S. The secret word has A (position 2), R (position 3), but no T, P, S. So the feedback would be T(x), A(✓), R(✓), P(x), S(x). Which matches the third feedback.

So that works. Therefore, the secret word is likely ""LARVA"". But wait, ""LARVA"" is a valid word. However, I need to check if there are other possibilities. Another possible word could be ""FARER"" but that's not valid. Or ""FARLY"" is not. Alternatively, ""LARVA"" is the correct answer. So the next guess should be ""LARVA"". But wait, the user might have a different secret word. Let me think again. Are there other words that fit the criteria?

Another possibility: ""FARER"" is not valid. ""FARER"" is not a standard word. ""FARLY"" is not. ""FARER"" is not. ""FARER"" is not. How about ""FARER"" is not. Alternatively, ""FARER"" is not. Maybe ""FARER"" is not. So ""LARVA"" seems like the best fit. Therefore, the next guess should be ""LARVA"". But wait, the user might have a different secret word. Let me think again. Are there other words that fit the structure _ A R _ _ with the allowed letters?

Another possibility: ""FARER"" is not valid. ""FARER"" is not. How about ""FARLY"" is not. ""FARLY"" is not. ""FARLY"" is not. Maybe ""FARER"" is not. Alternatively, ""FARER"" is not. So ""LARVA"" seems to be the only valid word that fits. Therefore, the next guess should be ""LARVA"".

But wait, the user might have a different word. Let me think of another possibility. What about ""FARER""? If it's allowed, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, ""FARER"" is not. So I think ""LARVA"" is the correct answer.",Guess 4: LARVA -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) A(✓) R(✓) V(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
