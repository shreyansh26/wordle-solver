Okay, let's see. I need to guess a 5-letter word. The user hasn't given any feedback yet, so I have to choose a word that's common and might have some letters that could be in the secret word. Since there's no feedback, I should pick a word that's likely to have some letters that are common in many words. Maybe something like ""CRANE"" or ""STARS""? Wait, but I need to think of a word that's valid. Let me think of a common 5-letter word. ""CRANE"" is a good one. Alternatively, ""APPLE"" is another common word. But maybe ""CRANE"" is better because it has some letters that might be in the secret word. Or maybe ""BRAKE""? Hmm. Wait, the example used BRISK, so maybe the secret word is something with common letters. Let me pick ""CRANE"" as my first guess. That's a valid 5-letter word. Alternatively, ""STARS"" is also a possibility. But I need to choose one. Let me go with ""CRANE"".

Okay, let's see. The user gave feedback after my first guess of ""CRANE"". The feedback shows that C, R, and A are correct and in the right positions, while N and E are incorrect.

Okay, let's see. The user has given feedback for two guesses. The first guess was CRANE, which had C, R, A correct in the right positions, and N and E incorrect. Then the second guess was CRAMP, which also had C, R, A correct, but M and P are incorrect. So now, the secret word starts with CRA, and the fourth and fifth letters are not N, E, M, or P. So the letters in positions 4 and 5 must be letters that are not in {N, E, M, P}. Let's think of possible letters for positions 4 and 5.

Possible letters could be B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But since the secret word is 5 letters, and the first three are C, R, A, the fourth and fifth letters need to be from the remaining letters not in the excluded set.

Let me think of words starting with CRA. For example, ""CRABS"" is C R A B S. But B and S are allowed. However, the feedback for the second guess said M and P are incorrect, so B and S are possible. Another word could be ""CRATE"" but E is excluded. ""CRACK"" has two C's, but the first C is correct. However, the secret word might not have another C. Wait, the feedback for the first guess only indicated that C is correct once. So maybe the secret word has only one C. So ""CRACK"" would have two C's, but that's possible. However, the feedback for the second guess didn't mention anything about C again, so maybe it's allowed. But the secret word might not have another C. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRANE"" but N is excluded. So no. 

Another possibility is ""CRASH"" (C R A S H). S and H are allowed. Or ""CRABS"" (C R A B S). Let me check if those are valid. Both are valid words. Alternatively, ""CRAZE"" is invalid because of E. ""CRAMP"" was invalid because of M and P. So the next guess should be a word that starts with CRA and has letters in positions 4 and 5 that are not N, E, M, P. Let's try ""CRABS"". Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, CRABS is a valid 5-letter word. So if I guess CRABS, the feedback would tell me if B and S are in the word. Alternatively, maybe ""CRASH"" is better. Let me think. If the secret word is ""CRABS"", then the feedback for CRABS would be C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), B(?), S(?). But since the secret word is CRA followed by B and S, then the feedback would have B and S as correct. But I don't know. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRATE"" but E is excluded. So that's not possible. 

Another approach: The secret word has C, R, A in positions 1, 2, 3. The fourth and fifth letters are not N, E, M, P. Let's think of other possibilities. Maybe ""CRANE"" is invalid because of N. ""CRACK"" is possible. Let me try ""CRACK"". But the feedback for the second guess didn't mention anything about C again, so maybe that's allowed. But the secret word could have another C. However, the first guess had C correct once, so maybe it's okay. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRABS"". Let me go with that. So the next guess would be CRABS. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes. So I'll choose CRABS as the third guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Okay, let's see. I need to guess a 5-letter word. The user hasn't given any feedback yet, so I have to choose a word that's common and might have some letters that could be in the secret word. Since there's no feedback, I should pick a word that's likely to have some letters that are common in many words. Maybe something like ""CRANE"" or ""STARS""? Wait, but I need to think of a word that's valid. Let me think of a common 5-letter word. ""CRANE"" is a good one. Alternatively, ""APPLE"" is another common word. But maybe ""CRANE"" is better because it has some letters that might be in the secret word. Or maybe ""BRAKE""? Hmm. Wait, the example used BRISK, so maybe the secret word is something with common letters. Let me pick ""CRANE"" as my first guess. That's a valid 5-letter word. Alternatively, ""STARS"" is also a possibility. But I need to choose one. Let me go with ""CRANE"".

Okay, let's see. The user gave feedback after my first guess of ""CRANE"". The feedback shows that C, R, and A are correct and in the right positions, while N and E are incorrect. So the secret word has C, R, A in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively. But N and E are not in the word. So the secret word is 5 letters, with the first three letters being C, R, A. The fourth and fifth letters are not N or E. Let me think of words that start with CRA. Possible words could be ""CRANE"" but N is incorrect, so that's not it. Maybe ""CRACK""? But that would have two C's. Wait, but the feedback for the first guess had C(✓), so the first letter is C. Then R(✓) second letter, A(✓) third. So the word is CRA _ _. The fourth and fifth letters can't be N or E. Let me think of words starting with CRA. ""CRATE"" is a possibility. Let me check: C R A T E. But the feedback for the first guess had E(x), so E is not in the word. So ""CRATE"" would have E as the fifth letter, which is invalid. So that's out. How about ""CRAMP""? C R A M P. M and P are not in the secret word? Wait, but the secret word's fourth and fifth letters can't be N or E. So maybe ""CRABS""? No, that's 5 letters but the third letter is A, but the secret word's third letter is A. Wait, ""CRABS"" is C R A B S. But the feedback says N and E are not in the word. So B and S could be possible. But I need to check if that's a valid word. Alternatively, ""CRACK"" would be C R A C K. But that has two C's. However, the feedback for the first guess only indicates that C is correct. So maybe the secret word is ""CRACK""? But the first letter is C, second R, third A, then C and K. But the feedback for the first guess says N and E are incorrect, so that's okay. But is ""CRACK"" a valid word? Yes. Alternatively, ""CRAZE"" but E is invalid. So that's out. Wait, the secret word can't have E. So maybe ""CRABS"" is possible. Let me think. Alternatively, ""CRAVE"" but E is invalid. So no. What about ""CRANE"" but N is invalid. So that's out. So maybe ""CRAMP"" is a possibility. Let me check. C R A M P. The fourth letter is M, fifth is P. The feedback says N and E are not in the word, so that's okay. But is ""CRAMP"" a valid word? Yes. Alternatively, ""CRASH"" but S is allowed. Wait, but the secret word's fourth and fifth letters can't be N or E. So ""CRASH"" is C R A S H. That's possible. But I need to check if that's a valid word. Yes. But how to choose between these options. Alternatively, maybe ""CRAVE"" is invalid because of E. So the possible words are CRA followed by letters that are not N or E. Let me think of another word. ""CRAZE"" is invalid. ""CRATE"" is invalid because of E. ""CRAMP"" is possible. ""CRASH"" is possible. ""CRACK"" is possible. Let me think of another approach. The secret word has C, R, A in positions 1, 2, 3. So the fourth and fifth letters are not N or E. So maybe the fourth letter is M, and fifth is P, making ""CRAMP"".

Okay, let's see. The user has given feedback for three guesses. The first three guesses were CRANE, CRAMP, and CRABS. The feedback for each shows that C, R, A are correct in the right positions. The fourth and fifth letters for each guess were incorrect. 

For CRANE, the fourth letter N and fifth E were incorrect. For CRAMP, fourth M and fifth P were wrong. For CRABS, fourth B and fifth S were wrong. So the secret word starts with CRA, and the fourth and fifth letters are not N, E, M, P, B, or S. So the letters in positions 4 and 5 must be from the remaining letters. Let's think of possible letters that are not in the excluded set. The excluded letters are N, E, M, P, B, S. So possible letters could be D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, R, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But since the secret word is 5 letters, and the first three are C, R, A, the fourth and fifth letters need to be from these possibilities.

Now, I need to think of a 5-letter word starting with CRA and having letters in positions 4 and 5 that are not in the excluded set. Let's think of possible words. For example, ""CRATE"" is invalid because of E. ""CRACK"" has two C's, but the first C is correct. However, the secret word might not have another C. ""CRASH"" has S, which is excluded. ""CRABS"" had S excluded. ""CRAZE"" has E excluded. ""CRANE"" has N excluded. ""CRAMP"" has M excluded. ""CRATE"" is out. ""CRAIL""? Not sure if that's a word. ""CRAVE"" has E. ""CRAZE"" again. Maybe ""CRATE"" is not possible. Wait, maybe the secret word is ""CRACK""? Let me check. If the secret word is CRACK, then the fourth letter is C and fifth is K. But the feedback for the first guess only indicated that C is correct once. However, the secret word could have another C. But the feedback for the second guess (CRAMP) had M and P wrong, so that's okay. But if the secret word is CRACK, then the fourth letter is C (which is allowed) and fifth is K. But the feedback for the third guess (CRABS) had B and S wrong, which is okay. So maybe the secret word is CRACK. Alternatively, maybe it's ""CRAKE""? But that's not a standard word. Wait, ""CRAKE"" is a type of bird, but is it a valid word? Maybe. Alternatively, ""CRATE"" is invalid. ""CRASH"" is invalid. ""CRANE"" is invalid. ""CRACK"" seems possible. Let me check if ""CRACK"" is a valid 5-letter word. Yes, it is. So if I guess CRACK, the feedback would show that the fourth letter C is correct (since it's in the secret word) and fifth K is correct. But wait, the feedback for the first guess only indicated that C is correct once. So if the secret word is CRACK, then the first C is correct, and the fourth C is also correct. But the feedback for the first guess only shows C(✓), so maybe that's acceptable. However, the secret word might not have another C. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAKE"". Let me think. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAIL"" (a type of tool?), but that's less common. Alternatively, ""CRAZE"" is invalid. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRATE"" but E is excluded. Wait, the third guess was CRABS, and the feedback said S was wrong. So the secret word's fifth letter is not S. So maybe the secret word is ""CRACK"". Let me go with that. So the next guess would be CRACK. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, it is. So I'll choose CRACK as the fourth guess.

But wait, the feedback for the third guess (CRABS) had B and S as wrong. So the secret word's fourth and fifth letters are not B or S. So if I guess CRACK, the fourth letter is C and fifth is K. That's allowed. So the feedback for CRACK would be C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), C(?), K(?). If the secret word is CRACK, then the fourth letter C is correct, and fifth K is correct. But the feedback would show that. However, if the secret word is CRA followed by another letter, like D, then maybe ""CRADY""? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAZE"" but E is excluded. Hmm. I think CRACK is a possible guess. Let me go with that.

<guess>CRACK</guess>",CRACK,"Okay, let's see. The user has given feedback for three guesses. The first three guesses were CRANE, CRAMP, and CRABS. The feedback for each shows that C, R, A are correct in the right positions. The fourth and fifth letters for each guess were incorrect. 

For CRANE, the fourth letter N and fifth E were incorrect. For CRAMP, fourth M and fifth P were wrong. For CRABS, fourth B and fifth S were wrong. So the secret word starts with CRA, and the fourth and fifth letters are not N, E, M, P, B, or S. So the letters in positions 4 and 5 must be from the remaining letters. Let's think of possible letters that are not in the excluded set. The excluded letters are N, E, M, P, B, S. So possible letters could be D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, R, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But since the secret word is 5 letters, and the first three are C, R, A, the fourth and fifth letters need to be from these possibilities.

Now, I need to think of a 5-letter word starting with CRA and having letters in positions 4 and 5 that are not in the excluded set. Let's think of possible words. For example, ""CRATE"" is invalid because of E. ""CRACK"" has two C's, but the first C is correct. However, the secret word might not have another C. ""CRASH"" has S, which is excluded. ""CRABS"" had S excluded. ""CRAZE"" has E excluded. ""CRANE"" has N excluded. ""CRAMP"" has M excluded. ""CRATE"" is out. ""CRAIL""? Not sure if that's a word. ""CRAVE"" has E. ""CRAZE"" again. Maybe ""CRATE"" is not possible. Wait, maybe the secret word is ""CRACK""? Let me check. If the secret word is CRACK, then the fourth letter is C and fifth is K. But the feedback for the first guess only indicated that C is correct once. However, the secret word could have another C.

So maybe the secret word is ""CRACK"". Let me go with that. So the next guess would be CRACK. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, it is. So I'll choose CRACK as the fourth guess.

But wait, the feedback for the third guess (CRABS) had B and S as wrong. So the secret word's fourth and fifth letters are not B or S. So if I guess CRACK, the fourth letter is C and fifth is K.

Okay, let's see. I need to guess a 5-letter word. The user hasn't given any feedback yet, so I have to choose a word that's common and might have some letters that could be in the secret word. Since there's no feedback, I should pick a word that's likely to have some letters that are common in many words. Maybe something like ""CRANE"" or ""STARS""? Wait, but I need to think of a word that's valid. Let me think of a common 5-letter word. ""CRANE"" is a good one. Alternatively, ""APPLE"" is another common word. But maybe ""CRANE"" is better because it has some letters that might be in the secret word. Or maybe ""BRAKE""? Hmm. Wait, the example used BRISK, so maybe the secret word is something with common letters. Let me pick ""CRANE"" as my first guess. That's a valid 5-letter word. Alternatively, ""STARS"" is also a possibility. But I need to choose one. Let me go with ""CRANE"".

<|im_start|>assistant
Okay, let's see. The user gave feedback after my first guess of ""CRANE"". The feedback shows that C, R, and A are correct and in the right positions, while N and E are incorrect. So the secret word has C, R, A in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively. But N and E are not in the word. So the secret word is 5 letters, with the first three letters being C, R, A. The fourth and fifth letters are not N or E. Let me think of words that start with CRA. Possible words could be ""CRANE"" but N is incorrect, so that's not it. Maybe ""CRACK""? But that would have two C's. Wait, but the feedback for the first guess had C(✓), so the first letter is C. Then R(✓) second letter, A(✓) third. So the word is CRA _ _. The fourth and fifth letters can't be N or E. Let me think of words starting with CRA. ""CRATE"" is a possibility. Let me check: C R A T E. But the feedback for the first guess had E(x), so E is not in the word. So ""CRATE"" would have E as the fifth letter, which is invalid. So that's out. How about ""CRAMP""? C R A M P. M and P are not in the secret word? Wait, but the secret word's fourth and fifth letters can't be N or E. So maybe ""CRABS""? No, that's 5 letters but the third letter is A, but the secret word's third letter is A. Wait, ""CRABS"" is C R A B S. But the feedback says N and E are not in the word. So B and S could be possible. But I need to check if that's a valid word. Alternatively, ""CRACK"" would be C R A C K. But that has two C's. However, the feedback for the first guess only indicates that C is correct. So maybe the secret word is ""CRACK""? But the first letter is C, second R, third A, then C and K. But the feedback for the first guess says N and E are incorrect, so that's okay. But is ""CRACK"" a valid word? Yes. Alternatively, ""CRAZE"" but E is invalid. So that's out. Wait, the secret word can't have E. So maybe ""CRABS"" is possible. Let me think. Alternatively, ""CRAVE"" but E is invalid. So no. What about ""CRANE"" but N is invalid. So that's out. So maybe ""CRAMP"" is a possibility. Let me check. C R A M P. The fourth letter is M, fifth is P. The feedback says N and E are not in the word, so that's okay. But is ""CRAMP"" a valid word? Yes. Alternatively, ""CRASH"" but S is allowed. Wait, but the secret word's fourth and fifth letters can't be N or E. So ""CRASH"" is C R A S H. That's possible. But I need to check if that's a valid word. Yes. But how to choose between these options. Alternatively, maybe ""CRAVE"" is invalid because of E. So the possible words are CRA followed by letters that are not N or E. Let me think of another word. ""CRAZE"" is invalid. ""CRATE"" is invalid because of E. ""CRAMP"" is possible. ""CRASH"" is possible. ""CRACK"" is possible. Let me think of another approach. The secret word has C, R, A in positions 1, 2, 3. So the fourth and fifth letters are not N or E. So maybe the fourth letter is M, and fifth is P, making ""CRAMP"". Alternatively, maybe the fourth is S and fifth is H, making ""CRASH"". Or maybe the fourth is K and fifth is T, making ""CRACK"". But I need to choose a word that's likely. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRANE"" but that's invalid because N is in the word. So no. So the next guess should be a word that starts with CRA and has letters not N or E. Let me pick ""CRAMP"" as the second guess. But wait, the user might have a different word. Alternatively, maybe ""CRATE"" is not possible because of E. So ""CRAMP"" seems like a good choice. Let me go with that.

Okay, let's see. The user has given feedback for two guesses. The first guess was CRANE, which had C, R, A correct in the right positions, and N and E incorrect. Then the second guess was CRAMP, which also had C, R, A correct, but M and P are incorrect. So now, the secret word starts with CRA, and the fourth and fifth letters are not N, E, M, or P. So the letters in positions 4 and 5 must be letters that are not in {N, E, M, P}. Let's think of possible letters for positions 4 and 5.

Possible letters could be B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But since the secret word is 5 letters, and the first three are C, R, A, the fourth and fifth letters need to be from the remaining letters not in the excluded set.

Let me think of words starting with CRA. For example, ""CRABS"" is C R A B S. But B and S are allowed. However, the feedback for the second guess said M and P are incorrect, so B and S are possible. Another word could be ""CRATE"" but E is excluded. ""CRACK"" has two C's, but the first C is correct. However, the secret word might not have another C. Wait, the feedback for the first guess only indicated that C is correct once. So maybe the secret word has only one C. So ""CRACK"" would have two C's, but that's possible. However, the feedback for the second guess didn't mention anything about C again, so maybe it's allowed. But the secret word might not have another C. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRANE"" but N is excluded. So no. 

Another possibility is ""CRASH"" (C R A S H). S and H are allowed. Or ""CRABS"" (C R A B S). Let me check if those are valid. Both are valid words. Alternatively, ""CRAZE"" is invalid because of E. ""CRAMP"" was invalid because of M and P. So the next guess should be a word that starts with CRA and has letters in positions 4 and 5 that are not N, E, M, P. Let's try ""CRABS"". Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, CRABS is a valid 5-letter word. So if I guess CRABS, the feedback would tell me if B and S are in the word. Alternatively, maybe ""CRASH"" is better. Let me think. If the secret word is ""CRABS"", then the feedback for CRABS would be C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), B(?), S(?). But since the secret word is CRA followed by B and S, then the feedback would have B and S as correct. But I don't know. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRATE"" but E is excluded. So that's not possible. 

Another approach: The secret word has C, R, A in positions 1, 2, 3. The fourth and fifth letters are not N, E, M, P. Let's think of other possibilities. Maybe ""CRANE"" is invalid because of N. ""CRACK"" is possible. Let me try ""CRACK"". But the feedback for the second guess didn't mention anything about C again, so maybe that's allowed. But the secret word could have another C. However, the first guess had C correct once, so maybe it's okay. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRABS"". Let me go with that. So the next guess would be CRABS. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes. So I'll choose CRABS as the third guess.

Okay, let's see. The user has given feedback for three guesses. The first three guesses were CRANE, CRAMP, and CRABS. The feedback for each shows that C, R, A are correct in the right positions. The fourth and fifth letters for each guess were incorrect. 

For CRANE, the fourth letter N and fifth E were incorrect. For CRAMP, fourth M and fifth P were wrong. For CRABS, fourth B and fifth S were wrong. So the secret word starts with CRA, and the fourth and fifth letters are not N, E, M, P, B, or S. So the letters in positions 4 and 5 must be from the remaining letters. Let's think of possible letters that are not in the excluded set. The excluded letters are N, E, M, P, B, S. So possible letters could be D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, R, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRATE"" but E is excluded. Wait, the third guess was CRABS, and the feedback said S was wrong. So the secret word's fifth letter is not S. So maybe the secret word is ""CRACK"". Let me go with that. So the next guess would be CRACK. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, it is. So I'll choose CRACK as the fourth guess.

But wait, the feedback for the third guess (CRABS) had B and S as wrong. So the secret word's fourth and fifth letters are not B or S. So if I guess CRACK, the fourth letter is C and fifth is K.

Let\'s think of possible letters for positions 4 and 5.\n\nPossible letters could be B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But since the secret word is 5 letters, and the first three are C, R, A, the fourth and fifth letters need to be from the remaining letters not in the excluded set.\n\nLet me think of words starting with CRA. For example, ""CRABS"" is C R A B S. But B and S are allowed. However, the feedback for the second guess said M and P are incorrect, so B and S are possible. Another word could be ""CRATE"" but E is excluded. ""CRACK"" has two C\'s, but the first C is correct. However, the secret word might not have another C. Wait, the feedback for the first guess only indicated that C is correct once. So maybe the secret word has only one C. So ""CRACK"" would have two C\'s, but that\'s possible. However, the feedback for the second guess didn\'t mention anything about C again, so maybe it\'s allowed. But the secret word might not have another C. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRANE"" but N is excluded. So no. \n\nAnother possibility is ""CRASH"" (C R A S H). S and H are allowed. Or ""CRABS"" (C R A B S). Let me check if those are valid. Both are valid words. Alternatively, ""CRAZE"" is invalid because of E. ""CRAMP"" was invalid because of M and P. So the next guess should be a word that starts with CRA and has letters in positions 4 and 5 that are not N, E, M, P. Let\'s try ""CRABS"". Let me check if that\'s a valid word. Yes, CRABS is a valid 5-letter word. So if I guess CRABS, the feedback would tell me if B and S are in the word. Alternatively, maybe ""CRASH"" is better. Let me think. If the secret word is ""CRABS"", then the feedback for CRABS would be C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), B(?), S(?). But since the secret word is CRA followed by B and S, then the feedback would have B and S as correct. But I don\'t know. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRATE"" but E is excluded. So that\'s not possible. \n\nAnother approach: The secret word has C, R, A in positions 1, 2, 3. The fourth and fifth letters are not N, E, M, P. Let\'s think of other possibilities. Maybe ""CRANE"" is invalid because of N. ""CRACK"" is possible. Let me try ""CRACK"". But the feedback for the second guess didn\'t mention anything about C again, so maybe that\'s allowed. But the secret word could have another C. However, the first guess had C correct once, so maybe it\'s okay. But I\'m not sure. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRABS"". Let me go with that.

Okay, let's see. The user has provided feedback for four guesses. The secret word starts with C, R, A in positions 1, 2, 3. The fourth and fifth letters are being narrowed down.

After the fourth guess, CRACK, the feedback shows that the fourth letter C is in the word but in the wrong position (-), and the fifth letter K is not in the word (x). So, the secret word has C in position 1, R in 2, A in 3. The fourth letter is not C (since it's a -), and the fifth letter is not K (x). Also, from previous guesses, we know that N, E, M, P, B, S are excluded. So the fourth letter can't be any of those, and the fifth can't be K or any of the excluded letters.

So the fourth letter must be a letter that's not in {N, E, M, P, B, S, C (from the fourth position feedback), K (from fifth position feedback)}. Wait, the fourth letter's feedback was C(-), meaning that C is in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word has a C somewhere else, but not in position 4. So the fourth letter is not C. But the secret word has C in position 1, so that's already accounted for. The fourth letter is another letter that's not in the excluded set. The fifth letter is not K.

So possible letters for position 4: D, F, G, H, I, J, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. And position 5: letters not in {N, E, M, P, B, S, K}.

Now, I need to think of a 5-letter word starting with CRA, with the fourth and fifth letters from the allowed sets. Let's think of possible words. For example, ""CRATE"" is invalid because of E. ""CRACK"" was tried, but K is excluded. ""CRASH"" has S, which is excluded. ""CRANE"" has N, excluded. ""CRABS"" has S, excluded. ""CRATE"" is out. ""CRAZE"" has E. ""CRACK"" is out. ""CRAIL""? Not sure. ""CRAKE""? Maybe. ""CRAZE"" again. ""CRAVE"" has E. ""CRAVE"" is out. ""CRAZE"" is out. ""CRAVE"" is out. ""CRATE"" is out. ""CRACK"" is out. ""CRANE"" is out. ""CRAMP"" is out. ""CRABS"" is out. ""CRAIL"" is a possible word? Maybe not. ""CRAZE"" is out. ""CRAVE"" is out. ""CRAVE"" is out. ""CRAKE"" is a word? Maybe. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAKE"". But I'm not sure if that's valid. Alternatively, maybe ""CRAZY"". But Z is allowed. Let me check. ""CRAZY"" is C R A Z Y. The fourth letter is Z, fifth Y. Are Z and Y allowed? Yes, since they are not in the excluded set. So ""CRAZY"" is a valid word. Let me check if that's possible. If the secret word is CRAZY, then the feedback for the next guess would be C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), Z(✓), Y(✓). But the user hasn't given that yet. So if I guess CRAZY, that would be the fifth guess. But I have to make sure that the letters Z and Y are allowed. Since they are not in the excluded set, that's okay. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAVE"" but E is excluded. So no. ""CRAZE"" is out. ""CRAIL"" is not a common word. Maybe ""CRATE"" is out. ""CRAVE"" is out. ""CRAZE"" is out. ""CRAZE"" is out. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAPE"". But P is excluded. So no. ""CRAPE"" is C R A P E. But P and E are excluded. So that's out. ""CRAPE"" is invalid. ""CRAPE"" is not allowed. ""CRAPE"" is invalid. ""CRAVE"" is invalid. ""CRAZE"" is invalid. ""CRAZY"" seems possible. Let me go with that. So the next guess would be CRAZY.

But wait, the user has 6 tries. So this would be the fifth guess. Let me check if that's allowed. Yes. So I'll choose CRAZY as the fifth guess. If that's correct, then the feedback would show all letters correct. If not, then the sixth guess would be needed. But based on the previous feedback, the secret word is likely to have C, R, A in the first three positions, and the fourth and fifth letters are Z and Y. So I'll proceed with that.

<guess>CRAZY</guess>",CRAZY,"Okay, let's see. The user has provided feedback for four guesses. The secret word starts with C, R, A in positions 1, 2, 3. The fourth and fifth letters are being narrowed down.

After the fourth guess, CRACK, the feedback shows that the fourth letter C is in the word but in the wrong position (-), and the fifth letter K is not in the word (x). So, the secret word has C in position 1, R in 2, A in 3. The fourth letter is not C (since it's a -), and the fifth letter is not K (x). Also, from previous guesses, we know that N, E, M, P, B, S are excluded. So the fourth letter can't be any of those, and the fifth can't be K or any of the excluded letters.

So the fourth letter must be a letter that's not in {N, E, M, P, B, S, C (from the fourth position feedback), K (from fifth position feedback)}. Wait, the fourth letter's feedback was C(-), meaning that C is in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word has a C somewhere else, but not in position 4. So the fourth letter is not C. But the secret word has C in position 1, so that's already accounted for. The fourth letter is another letter that's not in the excluded set. The fifth letter is not K.

So possible letters for position 4: D, F, G, H, I, J, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. And position 5: letters not in {N, E, M, P, B, S, K}.

Now, I need to think of a 5-letter word starting with CRA, with the fourth and fifth letters from the allowed sets. Let's think of possible words. For example, ""CRATE"" is invalid because of E. ""CRACK"" was tried, but K is excluded. ""CRASH"" has S, which is excluded. ""CRANE"" has N, excluded. ""CRABS"" has S, excluded. ""CRATE"" is out. ""CRAZE"" has E. ""CRACK"" is out. ""CRAIL""?

""CRABS"" is out. ""CRAIL"" is a possible word? Maybe not. ""CRAZE"" is out. ""CRAVE"" is out. ""CRAVE"" is out. ""CRAKE"" is a word? Maybe. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAKE"". But I'm not sure if that's valid. Alternatively, maybe ""CRAZY"". But Z is allowed. Let me check. ""CRAZY"" is C R A Z Y. The fourth letter is Z, fifth Y. Are Z and Y allowed? Yes, since they are not in the excluded set. So ""CRAZY"" is a valid word. Let me check if that's possible. If the secret word is CRAZY, then the feedback for the next guess would be C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), Z(✓), Y(✓). But the user hasn't given that yet. So if I guess CRAZY, that would be the fifth guess. But I have to make sure that the letters Z and Y are allowed. Since they are not in the excluded set, that's okay. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAVE"" but E is excluded. So no. ""CRAZE"" is out. ""CRAIL"" is not a common word. Maybe ""CRATE"" is out. ""CRAVE"" is out. ""CRAZE"" is out. ""CRAZE"" is out. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAPE"". But P is excluded. So no. ""CRAPE"" is C R A P E. But P and E are excluded. So that's out. ""CRAPE"" is invalid. ""CRAPE"" is not allowed. ""CRAPE"" is invalid. ""CRAVE"" is invalid. ""CRAZE"" is invalid. ""CRAZY"" seems possible. Let me go with that. So the next guess would be CRAZY.

But wait, the user has 6 tries. So this would be the fifth guess. Let me check if that's allowed. Yes. So I'll choose CRAZY as the fifth guess. If that's correct, then the feedback would show all letters correct. If not, then the sixth guess would be needed.

Okay, let's see. I need to guess a 5-letter word. The user hasn't given any feedback yet, so I have to choose a word that's common and might have some letters that could be in the secret word. Since there's no feedback, I should pick a word that's likely to have some letters that are common in many words. Maybe something like ""CRANE"" or ""STARS""? Wait, but I need to think of a word that's valid. Let me think of a common 5-letter word. ""CRANE"" is a good one. Alternatively, ""APPLE"" is another common word. But maybe ""CRANE"" is better because it has some letters that might be in the secret word. Or maybe ""BRAKE""? Hmm. Wait, the example used BRISK, so maybe the secret word is something with common letters. Let me pick ""CRANE"" as my first guess. That's a valid 5-letter word. Alternatively, ""STARS"" is also a possibility. But I need to choose one. Let me go with ""CRANE"".

Okay, let's see. The user gave feedback after my first guess of ""CRANE"". The feedback shows that C, R, and A are correct and in the right positions, while N and E are incorrect. So the secret word has C, R, A in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively. But N and E are not in the word. So the secret word is 5 letters, with the first three letters being C, R, A. The fourth and fifth letters are not N or E. Let me think of words that start with CRA. Possible words could be ""CRANE"" but N is incorrect, so that's not it. Maybe ""CRACK""? But that would have two C's. Wait, but the feedback for the first guess had C(✓), so the first letter is C. Then R(✓) second letter, A(✓) third. So the word is CRA _ _. The fourth and fifth letters can't be N or E. Let me think of words starting with CRA. ""CRATE"" is a possibility. Let me check: C R A T E. But the feedback for the first guess had E(x), so E is not in the word. So ""CRATE"" would have E as the fifth letter, which is invalid. So that's out. How about ""CRAMP""? C R A M P. M and P are not in the secret word? Wait, but the secret word's fourth and fifth letters can't be N or E. So maybe ""CRABS""? No, that's 5 letters but the third letter is A, but the secret word's third letter is A. Wait, ""CRABS"" is C R A B S. But the feedback says N and E are not in the word. So B and S could be possible. But I need to check if that's a valid word. Alternatively, ""CRACK"" would be C R A C K. But that has two C's. However, the feedback for the first guess only indicates that C is correct. So maybe the secret word is ""CRACK""? But the first letter is C, second R, third A, then C and K. But the feedback for the first guess says N and E are incorrect, so that's okay. But is ""CRACK"" a valid word? Yes. Alternatively, ""CRAZE"" but E is invalid. So that's out. Wait, the secret word can't have E. So maybe ""CRABS"" is possible. Let me think. Alternatively, ""CRAVE"" but E is invalid. So no. What about ""CRANE"" but N is invalid. So that's out. So maybe ""CRAMP"" is a possibility. Let me check. C R A M P. The fourth letter is M, fifth is P. The feedback says N and E are not in the word, so that's okay. But is ""CRAMP"" a valid word? Yes. Alternatively, ""CRASH"" but S is allowed. Wait, but the secret word's fourth and fifth letters can't be N or E. So ""CRASH"" is C R A S H. That's possible. But I need to check if that's a valid word. Yes. But how to choose between these options. Alternatively, maybe ""CRAVE"" is invalid because of E. So the possible words are CRA followed by letters that are not N or E. Let me think of another word. ""CRAZE"" is invalid. ""CRATE"" is invalid because of E. ""CRAMP"" is possible. ""CRASH"" is possible. ""CRACK"" is possible. Let me think of another approach. The secret word has C, R, A in positions 1, 2, 3. So the fourth and fifth letters are not N or E. So maybe the fourth letter is M, and fifth is P, making ""CRAMP"". Alternatively, maybe the fourth is S and fifth is H, making ""CRASH"". Or maybe the fourth is K and fifth is T, making ""CRACK"". But I need to choose a word that's likely. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRANE"" but that's invalid because N is in the word. So no. So the next guess should be a word that starts with CRA and has letters not N or E. Let me pick ""CRAMP"" as the second guess. But wait, the user might have a different word. Alternatively, maybe ""CRATE"" is not possible because of E. So ""CRAMP"" seems like a good choice.

Okay, let's see. The user has given feedback for two guesses. The first guess was CRANE, which had C, R, A correct in the right positions, and N and E incorrect. Then the second guess was CRAMP, which also had C, R, A correct, but M and P are incorrect. So now, the secret word starts with CRA, and the fourth and fifth letters are not N, E, M, or P. So the letters in positions 4 and 5 must be letters that are not in {N, E, M, P}. Let's think of possible letters for positions 4 and 5.

Possible letters could be B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But since the secret word is 5 letters, and the first three are C, R, A, the fourth and fifth letters need to be from the remaining letters not in the excluded set.

Let me think of words starting with CRA. For example, ""CRABS"" is C R A B S. But B and S are allowed. However, the feedback for the second guess said M and P are incorrect, so B and S are possible. Another word could be ""CRATE"" but E is excluded. ""CRACK"" has two C's, but the first C is correct. However, the secret word might not have another C. Wait, the feedback for the first guess only indicated that C is correct once. So maybe the secret word has only one C. So ""CRACK"" would have two C's, but that's possible. However, the feedback for the second guess didn't mention anything about C again, so maybe it's allowed. But the secret word might not have another C. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRANE"" but N is excluded. So no. 

Another possibility is ""CRASH"" (C R A S H). S and H are allowed. Or ""CRABS"" (C R A B S). Let me check if those are valid. Both are valid words. Alternatively, ""CRAZE"" is invalid because of E. ""CRAMP"" was invalid because of M and P. So the next guess should be a word that starts with CRA and has letters in positions 4 and 5 that are not N, E, M, P. Let's try ""CRABS"". Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, CRABS is a valid 5-letter word. So if I guess CRABS, the feedback would tell me if B and S are in the word. Alternatively, maybe ""CRASH"" is better. Let me think. If the secret word is ""CRABS"", then the feedback for CRABS would be C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), B(?), S(?). But since the secret word is CRA followed by B and S, then the feedback would have B and S as correct. But I don't know. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRATE"" but E is excluded. So that's not possible. 

Another approach: The secret word has C, R, A in positions 1, 2, 3. The fourth and fifth letters are not N, E, M, P. Let's think of other possibilities. Maybe ""CRANE"" is invalid because of N. ""CRACK"" is possible. Let me try ""CRACK"". But the feedback for the second guess didn't mention anything about C again, so maybe that's allowed. But the secret word could have another C. However, the first guess had C correct once, so maybe it's okay. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRABS"". Let me go with that. So the next guess would be CRABS. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes. So I'll choose CRABS as the third guess.

Okay, let's see. The user has given feedback for three guesses. The first three guesses were CRANE, CRAMP, and CRABS. The feedback for each shows that C, R, A are correct in the right positions. The fourth and fifth letters for each guess were incorrect. 

For CRANE, the fourth letter N and fifth E were incorrect. For CRAMP, fourth M and fifth P were wrong. For CRABS, fourth B and fifth S were wrong. So the secret word starts with CRA, and the fourth and fifth letters are not N, E, M, P, B, or S. So the letters in positions 4 and 5 must be from the remaining letters. Let's think of possible letters that are not in the excluded set. The excluded letters are N, E, M, P, B, S. So possible letters could be D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O, Q, R, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But since the secret word is 5 letters, and the first three are C, R, A, the fourth and fifth letters need to be from these possibilities.

Now, I need to think of a 5-letter word starting with CRA and having letters in positions 4 and 5 that are not in the excluded set. Let's think of possible words. For example, ""CRATE"" is invalid because of E. ""CRACK"" has two C's, but the first C is correct. However, the secret word might not have another C. ""CRASH"" has S, which is excluded. ""CRABS"" had S excluded. ""CRAZE"" has E excluded. ""CRANE"" has N excluded. ""CRAMP"" has M excluded. ""CRATE"" is out. ""CRAIL""? Not sure if that's a word. ""CRAVE"" has E. ""CRAZE"" again. Maybe ""CRATE"" is not possible. Wait, maybe the secret word is ""CRACK""? Let me check. If the secret word is CRACK, then the fourth letter is C and fifth is K. But the feedback for the first guess only indicated that C is correct once. However, the secret word could have another C. But the feedback for the second guess (CRAMP) had M and P wrong, so that's okay. But if the secret word is CRACK, then the fourth letter is C (which is allowed) and fifth is K. But the feedback for the third guess (CRABS) had B and S wrong, which is okay. So maybe the secret word is CRACK. Alternatively, maybe it's ""CRAKE""? But that's not a standard word. Wait, ""CRAKE"" is a type of bird, but is it a valid word? Maybe. Alternatively, ""CRATE"" is invalid. ""CRASH"" is invalid. ""CRANE"" is invalid. ""CRACK"" seems possible. Let me check if ""CRACK"" is a valid 5-letter word. Yes, it is. So if I guess CRACK, the feedback would show that the fourth letter C is correct (since it's in the secret word) and fifth K is correct. But wait, the feedback for the first guess only indicated that C is correct once. So if the secret word is CRACK, then the first C is correct, and the fourth C is also correct. But the feedback for the first guess only shows C(✓), so maybe that's acceptable. However, the secret word might not have another C. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAKE"". Let me think. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAIL"" (a type of tool?), but that's less common. Alternatively, ""CRAZE"" is invalid. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRATE"" but E is excluded. Wait, the third guess was CRABS, and the feedback said S was wrong. So the secret word's fifth letter is not S. So maybe the secret word is ""CRACK"". Let me go with that. So the next guess would be CRACK. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, it is. So I'll choose CRACK as the fourth guess.

But wait, the feedback for the third guess (CRABS) had B and S as wrong. So the secret word's fourth and fifth letters are not B or S. So if I guess CRACK, the fourth letter is C and fifth is K. That's allowed. So the feedback for CRACK would be C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), C(?), K(?). If the secret word is CRACK, then the fourth letter C is correct, and fifth K is correct. But the feedback would show that. However, if the secret word is CRA followed by another letter, like D, then maybe ""CRADY""? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAZE"" but E is excluded. Hmm. I think CRACK is a possible guess. Let me go with that.

Okay, let's see. The user has provided feedback for four guesses. The secret word starts with C, R, A in positions 1, 2, 3. The fourth and fifth letters are being narrowed down.

After the fourth guess, CRACK, the feedback shows that the fourth letter C is in the word but in the wrong position (-), and the fifth letter K is not in the word (x). So, the secret word has C in position 1, R in 2, A in 3. The fourth letter is not C (since it's a -), and the fifth letter is not K (x). Also, from previous guesses, we know that N, E, M, P, B, S are excluded. So the fourth letter can't be any of those, and the fifth can't be K or any of the excluded letters.

So the fourth letter must be a letter that's not in {N, E, M, P, B, S, C (from the fourth position feedback), K (from fifth position feedback)}. Wait, the fourth letter's feedback was C(-), meaning that C is in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word has a C somewhere else, but not in position 4. So the fourth letter is not C. But the secret word has C in position 1, so that's already accounted for. The fourth letter is another letter that's not in the excluded set. The fifth letter is not K.

So possible letters for position 4: D, F, G, H, I, J, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. And position 5: letters not in {N, E, M, P, B, S, K}.

Now, I need to think of a 5-letter word starting with CRA, with the fourth and fifth letters from the allowed sets. Let's think of possible words. For example, ""CRATE"" is invalid because of E. ""CRACK"" was tried, but K is excluded. ""CRASH"" has S, which is excluded. ""CRANE"" has N, excluded. ""CRABS"" has S, excluded. ""CRATE"" is out. ""CRAZE"" has E. ""CRACK"" is out. ""CRAIL""? Not sure. ""CRAKE""? Maybe. ""CRAZE"" again. ""CRAVE"" has E. ""CRAVE"" is out. ""CRAZE"" is out. ""CRAVE"" is out. ""CRATE"" is out. ""CRACK"" is out. ""CRANE"" is out. ""CRAMP"" is out. ""CRABS"" is out. ""CRAIL"" is a possible word? Maybe not. ""CRAZE"" is out. ""CRAVE"" is out. ""CRAVE"" is out. ""CRAKE"" is a word? Maybe. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAKE"". But I'm not sure if that's valid. Alternatively, maybe ""CRAZY"". But Z is allowed. Let me check. ""CRAZY"" is C R A Z Y. The fourth letter is Z, fifth Y. Are Z and Y allowed? Yes, since they are not in the excluded set. So ""CRAZY"" is a valid word. Let me check if that's possible. If the secret word is CRAZY, then the feedback for the next guess would be C(✓), R(✓), A(✓), Z(✓), Y(✓). But the user hasn't given that yet. So if I guess CRAZY, that would be the fifth guess. But I have to make sure that the letters Z and Y are allowed. Since they are not in the excluded set, that's okay. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAVE"" but E is excluded. So no. ""CRAZE"" is out. ""CRAIL"" is not a common word. Maybe ""CRATE"" is out. ""CRAVE"" is out. ""CRAZE"" is out. ""CRAZE"" is out. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAPE"". But P is excluded. So no. ""CRAPE"" is C R A P E. But P and E are excluded. So that's out. ""CRAPE"" is invalid. ""CRAPE"" is not allowed. ""CRAPE"" is invalid. ""CRAVE"" is invalid. ""CRAZE"" is invalid. ""CRAZY"" seems possible. Let me go with that. So the next guess would be CRAZY.

But wait, the user has 6 tries. So this would be the fifth guess. Let me check if that's allowed. Yes. So I'll choose CRAZY as the fifth guess. If that's correct, then the feedback would show all letters correct. If not, then the sixth guess would be needed. But based on the previous feedback, the secret word is likely to have C, R, A in the first three positions, and the fourth and fifth letters are Z and Y. So I'll proceed with that.

Okay, let's see. The user has given feedback for five guesses, and now I need to make the sixth guess. Let me recap the feedback so far.

The secret word starts with C, R, A in positions 1, 2, 3. The fourth and fifth letters have been narrowed down through previous guesses. 

From guess 1 (CRANE), N and E are excluded. Guess 2 (CRAMP) excluded M and P. Guess 3 (CRABS) excluded B and S. Guess 4 (CRACK) had C in the fourth position as a wrong letter (-) and K as excluded (x). Guess 5 (CRAZY) had Z and Y as excluded (x). 

So, the fourth and fifth letters can't be N, E, M, P, B, S, K, Z, Y. The remaining possible letters for positions 4 and 5 are D, F, G, H, I, J, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X. 

But wait, the feedback for guess 4 (CRACK) said that C is in the word but in the wrong position (-). So the secret word has a C somewhere else, but not in position 4. Since position 1 is already C, maybe there's another C in the word. But the secret word is 5 letters, so maybe there's another C in position 4 or 5? Wait, but guess 4's feedback said that the fourth letter C is in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word has a C in position 4 or 5? Wait, no. The feedback for guess 4 (CRACK) was C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) C(-) K(x). The fourth letter in CRACK is C, which is in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word has a C, but not in position 4. So the secret word has a C in position 1 (already confirmed), and another C in position 5? Or maybe in position 3? But position 3 is A. Wait, no. The secret word has C in position 1, R in 2, A in 3. The fourth and fifth letters are not N, E, M, P, B, S, K, Z, Y. Also, from guess 4, the fourth letter C is in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word has a C in position 4 or 5? But position 4 is the fourth letter, and the feedback says that in guess 4 (CRACK), the fourth letter C is in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word has a C, but not in position 4. Therefore, the C must be in position 5. Wait, but position 5 is the fifth letter. So if the secret word has a C in position 5, then the fifth letter is C. But in guess 5 (CRAZY), the fifth letter was Y, which was excluded. So the secret word's fifth letter is C? But that would mean the secret word is CRA followed by something else and then C. But that's not possible because the fifth letter is C. Wait, but the secret word is 5 letters. Let me think again.

The secret word is C (position 1), R (2), A (3), then position 4 and 5. From guess 4 (CRACK), the fourth letter is C, which is in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word has a C in position 4 or 5. But position 4 is the fourth letter. If the secret word has a C in position 4, then the feedback for guess 4 (CRACK) would have C in position 4 as correct, but the feedback says it's a -, meaning it's in the word but in the wrong position. Therefore, the secret word has a C in position 5. Because if the secret word had a C in position 4, then the fourth letter would be correct, but the feedback says it's a -, so it's in the word but in the wrong position. Therefore, the secret word must have a C in position 5. But in guess 5 (CRAZY), the fifth letter was Y, which was excluded. So the secret word's fifth letter is C. Therefore, the secret word is CRA followed by some letter in position 4 and then C in position 5. But the fifth letter is C, which is allowed. Wait, but in guess 5, the fifth letter was Y, which was excluded. So the secret word's fifth letter is C. So the secret word is CRA _ C. The fourth letter is not in the excluded set. Let me check the excluded letters again. From previous guesses, the excluded letters for positions 4 and 5 are N, E, M, P, B, S, K, Z, Y. So the fourth letter can be D, F, G, H, I, J, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X. The fifth letter is C. So the secret word is CRA followed by a letter from the allowed set in position 4 and then C in position 5. 

So possible words could be CRA DC? No, that's not a word. Let me think of valid words. For example, ""CRACK"" is C R A C K. But in guess 4, the fifth letter was K, which was excluded. So that's not possible. Wait, but if the secret word is CRA DC, but that's not a word. Alternatively, ""CRAIC""? Not sure. ""CRAIC"" is a term, but not sure. Alternatively, ""CRATE"" is invalid. ""CRAZE"" is invalid. ""CRAVE"" is invalid. ""CRAVE"" is invalid. ""CRAZE"" is invalid. ""CRAZE"" is invalid. Hmm. Maybe the secret word is ""CRAIC"". But that's not a common word. Alternatively, ""CRAKE"" is a word. But the fourth letter is K, which was excluded in guess 4. Wait, in guess 4, the fourth letter was C, and the feedback said it's in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word has a C in position 5. So the secret word is CRA _ C. Let me think of a word like ""CRACK"" but with the fifth letter as C. Wait, ""CRACK"" is C R A C K. So the fifth letter is K, which was excluded. So that's not possible. So the secret word must be CRA _ C. Let me think of words that fit. For example, ""CRATE"" is invalid. ""CRAKE"" is a word (a type of bird), but the fourth letter is K, which was excluded. So that's not possible. ""CRATE"" is invalid. ""CRACK"" is invalid. ""CRAZE"" is invalid. ""CRAVE"" is invalid. ""CRAZE"" is invalid. ""CRAVE"" is invalid. ""CRAZE"" is invalid. 

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""CRACK"" but the fifth letter is C? That would be C R A C C, but that's not a valid word. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAKE"" but the fourth letter is K. But K was excluded in guess 4. Wait, no. The feedback for guess 4 (CRACK) said that the fourth letter C is in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word has a C in position 5. So the secret word is CRA _ C. Let me think of a word like ""CRAIC"" (a term in some contexts), but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAPE"" but P is excluded. So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAVE"" but E is excluded. So that's not possible. Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I need to consider that the secret word has a C in position 5, and the fourth letter is something else. Let me think of possible words. For example, ""CRADE"" is not a word. ""CRATE"" is invalid. ""CRAZE"" is invalid. ""CRAVE"" is invalid. ""CRAKE"" is a word, but K is excluded. Wait, but the fourth letter in ""CRAKE"" is K, which was excluded in guess 4. So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAIC"". If that's allowed, then the fourth letter is I and fifth is C. So the word would be CRAIC. But I'm not sure if that's a valid word. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAZE"" but E is excluded. No. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the previous steps. Let me check again. The feedback for guess 4 (CRACK) was C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) C(-) K(x). This means that the secret word has a C in the word but not in position 4 (since the fourth letter in CRACK is C, which is in the word but in the wrong position, so the C is in the word but not in position 4). Therefore, the C must be in position 5. So the secret word is C R A _ C. The fourth letter is something else, and the fifth is C. 

So possible words: CRAIC, CRAIC is a word? Maybe not. ""CRAIC"" is a term in some contexts, but not sure. Alternatively, ""CRAKE"" is a word, but the fourth letter is K, which was excluded. But if the secret word is CRAKE, then the fourth letter is K, which was excluded in guess 4. Wait, but in guess 4, the feedback said that the fourth letter C is in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word has a C, but not in position 4. So if the secret word is CRAKE, then the C is in position 1, and the K is in position 4. But the feedback for guess 4 (CRACK) said that the fourth letter C is in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word has a C, which is in position 1, and the fourth letter is K. But that would mean that the secret word has a C in position 1, and the fourth letter is K, which is allowed. But the feedback for guess 4 (CRACK) said that the fourth letter C is in the word but in the wrong position. Wait, that's confusing. If the secret word is CRAKE, then the fourth letter is K, and the fifth is E. But E is excluded. So that's not possible. 

I think I'm missing something here. Let's try to think of a word that starts with CRA and has a C in position 5. The only possible word I can think of is ""CRACK"" but that has K as the fifth letter. But K was excluded in guess 4. So that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRACK"" but the fifth letter is C. That would be C R A C C, which is not a valid word. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRATE"" but with E excluded. No. 

Wait, perhaps the secret word is ""CRAKE"" but the fifth letter is K, which is excluded. No. 

Hmm. Maybe the secret word is ""CRACK"" but the fifth letter is C. But that's not valid. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRATE"" but with E excluded. No. 

I think I need to make a guess based on the remaining possible letters. The fourth letter can be D, F, G, H, I, J, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X. The fifth letter is C. So the word is CRA _ C. Let's try ""CRAIC"" (if that's a word) or ""CRAIC"". Alternatively, maybe ""CRAIC"" is the secret word. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAVE"" but E is excluded. No. 

Given that I have to make a guess, I'll choose ""CRAIC"" as the sixth guess. But I'm not sure if that's a valid word. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRACK"" but with the fifth letter as C. But that's not valid. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRATE"" but with E excluded. No. 

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""CRAZE"" but E is excluded. No. 

I think I'm stuck. Maybe the secret word is ""CRACK"" and the feedback for guess 4 was incorrect. But no, the feedback is given. So I have to go with the information. Given that, the only possible word I can think of is ""CRAIC"". So I'll go with that.

<guess>CRAIC</guess>",CRAIC,"Okay, let's see. The user has given feedback for five guesses, and now I need to make the sixth guess. Let me recap the feedback so far.

The secret word starts with C, R, A in positions 1, 2, 3. The fourth and fifth letters have been narrowed down through previous guesses. 

From guess 1 (CRANE), N and E are excluded. Guess 2 (CRAMP) excluded M and P. Guess 3 (CRABS) excluded B and S. Guess 4 (CRACK) had C in the fourth position as a wrong letter (-) and K as excluded (x). Guess 5 (CRAZY) had Z and Y as excluded (x). 

So, the fourth and fifth letters can't be N, E, M, P, B, S, K, Z, Y. The remaining possible letters for positions 4 and 5 are D, F, G, H, I, J, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X. 

But wait, the feedback for guess 4 (CRACK) said that C is in the word but in the wrong position (-). So the secret word has a C somewhere else, but not in position 4. Since position 1 is already C, maybe there's another C in the word. But the secret word is 5 letters, so maybe there's another C in position 4 or 5? Wait, but guess 4's feedback said that the fourth letter C is in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word has a C in position 4 or 5? Wait, no. The feedback for guess 4 (CRACK) was C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) C(-) K(x). The fourth letter in CRACK is C, which is in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word has a C, but not in position 4. So the secret word has a C in position 1 (already confirmed), and another C in position 5? Or maybe in position 3? But position 3 is A. Wait, no. The secret word has C in position 1, R in 2, A in 3. The fourth and fifth letters are not N, E, M, P, B, S, K, Z, Y. Also, from guess 4, the fourth letter C is in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word has a C in position 4 or 5? But position 4 is the fourth letter, and the feedback says that in guess 4 (CRACK), the fourth letter C is in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word has a C, but not in position 4. Therefore, the C must be in position 5. Wait, but position 5 is the fifth letter. So if the secret word has a C in position 5, then the fifth letter is C. But in guess 5 (CRAZY), the fifth letter was Y, which was excluded. So the secret word's fifth letter is C? But that would mean the secret word is CRA followed by something else and then C. But that's not possible because the fifth letter is C. Wait, but the secret word is 5 letters. Let me think again.

The secret word is C (position 1), R (2), A (3), then position 4 and 5. From guess 4 (CRACK), the fourth letter is C, which is in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word has a C in position 4 or 5. But position 4 is the fourth letter. If the secret word has a C in position 4, then the feedback for guess 4 (CRACK) would have C in position 4 as correct, but the feedback says it's a -, meaning it's in the word but in the wrong position. Therefore, the secret word has a C in position 5. Because if the secret word had a C in position 4, then the fourth letter would be correct, but the feedback says it's a -, so it's in the word but in the wrong position. Therefore, the secret word must have a C in position 5. But in guess 5 (CRAZY), the fifth letter was Y, which was excluded. So the secret word's fifth letter is C. Therefore, the secret word is CRA followed by some letter in position 4 and then C in position 5. But the fifth letter is C, which is allowed. Wait, but in guess 5, the fifth letter was Y, which was excluded. So the secret word's fifth letter is C. So the secret word is CRA _ C. The fourth letter is not in the excluded set. Let me check the excluded letters again. From previous guesses, the excluded letters for positions 4 and 5 are N, E, M, P, B, S, K, Z, Y. So the fourth letter can be D, F, G, H, I, J, L, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X. The fifth letter is C. So the secret word is CRA followed by a letter from the allowed set in position 4 and then C in position 5. 

So possible words could be CRA DC? No, that's not a word. Let me think of valid words. For example, ""CRACK"" is C R A C K. But in guess 4, the fifth letter was K, which was excluded. So that's not possible. Wait, but if the secret word is CRA DC, but that's not a word. Alternatively, ""CRAIC""? Not sure. ""CRAIC"" is a term, but not sure. Alternatively, ""CRATE"" is invalid. ""CRAZE"" is invalid. ""CRAVE"" is invalid. ""CRAVE"" is invalid. ""CRAZE"" is invalid. ""CRAZE"" is invalid. Hmm. Maybe the secret word is ""CRAIC"". But that's not a common word. Alternatively, ""CRAKE"" is a word. But the fourth letter is K, which was excluded in guess 4. Wait, in guess 4, the fourth letter was C, and the feedback said it's in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word has a C in position 5. So the secret word is CRA _ C. Let me think of a word like ""CRACK"" but with the fifth letter as C. Wait, ""CRACK"" is C R A C K. So the fifth letter is K, which was excluded. So that's not possible. So the secret word must be CRA _ C. Let me think of words that fit. For example, ""CRATE"" is invalid. ""CRAKE"" is a word (a type of bird), but the fourth letter is K, which was excluded. So that's not possible. ""CRATE"" is invalid. ""CRACK"" is invalid. ""CRAZE"" is invalid. ""CRAVE"" is invalid. ""CRAZE"" is invalid. ""CRAVE"" is invalid. ""CRAZE"" is invalid. 

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""CRACK"" but the fifth letter is C? That would be C R A C C, but that's not a valid word. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAKE"" but the fourth letter is K. But K was excluded in guess 4. Wait, no. The feedback for guess 4 (CRACK) said that the fourth letter C is in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word has a C in position 5. So the secret word is CRA _ C. Let me think of a word like ""CRAIC"" (a term in some contexts), but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAPE"" but P is excluded. So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAVE"" but E is excluded. So that's not possible. Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I need to consider that the secret word has a C in position 5, and the fourth letter is something else. Let me think of possible words. For example, ""CRADE"" is not a word. ""CRATE"" is invalid. ""CRAZE"" is invalid. ""CRAVE"" is invalid. ""CRAKE"" is a word, but K is excluded. Wait, but the fourth letter in ""CRAKE"" is K, which was excluded in guess 4. So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAIC"". If that's allowed, then the fourth letter is I and fifth is C. So the word would be CRAIC. But I'm not sure if that's a valid word. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""CRAZE"" but E is excluded. No.
