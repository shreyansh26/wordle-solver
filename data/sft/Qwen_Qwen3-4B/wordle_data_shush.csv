Okay, let's see. I need to guess a 5-letter word. The user hasn't given any feedback yet, so this is my first try. I should pick a common 5-letter word that's probably a good starting point. Maybe something like ""CRANE"" or ""BRAIN""? Wait, but maybe ""CRANE"" is too specific. Alternatively, ""STARS"" or ""PLANT""? Hmm. Wait, the example used ""BRISK"" as the secret word. But since I don't know the secret word, I need to choose a word that's common enough to have letters that might be in the secret word.

Alternatively, maybe ""TREES"" or ""WATER""? Let me think. Let's go with ""CRANE"" as the first guess. It's a common word and has a mix of letters that could be in various positions. Or maybe ""BRAIN"" since it's a common word. Wait, but I need to make sure it's a valid 5-letter English word. Both are valid. Let me pick ""BRAIN"" as the first guess. If the feedback comes back, I can adjust based on the symbols. But since there's no feedback yet, I just need to make an educated guess. Alternatively, maybe ""STARS"" is better. Wait, but I need to think of a word that's likely to have letters that could be in the secret word. Maybe ""CRATE""? Or ""RADIO""? Hmm. Let me go with ""CRANE"" as the first guess. I think that's a solid choice.

Okay, so my first guess was ""CRANE"", and the feedback was that none of the letters are correct. That means the secret word doesn't have any of the letters C, R, A, N, or E. So I need to pick a new 5-letter word that doesn't include any of those letters.

Let me think. The letters to avoid are C, R, A, N, E. So the next guess should not have any of these. Let's see. Possible letters could be B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But need to form a 5-letter word.

Maybe ""BRAKE"" but that has A and E, which are excluded. Wait, no. Wait, the feedback said all letters in CRANE are wrong. So the secret word doesn't have C, R, A, N, or E. So any word with those letters is out. So I need to pick a word that's made up of letters not in that set.

Let me think of words that don't include those letters. Maybe ""BRAIN"" is out because it has A and I, but wait, the secret word doesn't have A. Wait, the feedback said A is wrong. So the secret word doesn't have A. So ""BRAIN"" has A, so that's invalid. So I need to avoid words with A, C, R, N, E.

So possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let me think of a 5-letter word. Maybe ""BLAST""? Let's check: B, L, A, S, T. Wait, A is excluded. So no. ""BLAST"" has A, which is wrong. So that's invalid. How about ""BLIMP""? B, L, I, M, P. None of those letters are in the forbidden list. That's a valid word. Or ""BLINK"" but that has K and N? Wait, N is forbidden. So ""BLINK"" has N, which is wrong. So no. ""BLIMP"" is good. Alternatively, ""FLUKE""? F, L, U, K, E. E is forbidden. So no. ""FLUKE"" has E. ""FLUSH""? F, L, U, S, H. All allowed letters. That's a valid word. Or ""FLUSH"".

Alternatively, ""FLOPS""? F, L, O, P, S. All allowed. So maybe ""FLOPS"". Or ""FLUSH"". Let me pick ""FLUSH"" as the next guess. Let's see. If the secret word has any of those letters, the feedback will indicate. But since the first guess had no letters correct, the secret word is made of letters not in CRANE. So ""FLUSH"" is a good candidate. Alternatively, ""BLIMP"" is another option. Let me go with ""FLUSH"".

Okay, let's see. The user has given feedback for two guesses. The first guess was CRANE, which had all letters incorrect. The second guess was FLUSH, and the feedback was F(x), L(x), U(✓), S(✓), H(✓). So that means the secret word has U, S, and H in the correct positions. Wait, no—the feedback symbols indicate whether each letter is correct in position (✓), present but wrong position (-), or not present (x). So for FLUSH, the letters U, S, H are correct in their positions? Wait, no. Wait, the feedback for FLUSH is F(x), L(x), U(✓), S(✓), H(✓). So that means U is in the correct position (third letter?), S is in the correct position (fourth?), and H is in the correct position (fifth?).

Wait, the secret word is 5 letters. Let me check the positions. For FLUSH, the letters are F (1st), L (2nd), U (3rd), S (4th), H (5th). The feedback says U(✓), S(✓), H(✓). So that means the secret word has U in position 3, S in position 4, and H in position 5. So the secret word is _ U S H. Wait, but the third letter is U, fourth is S, fifth is H. So the word so far is _ U S H. The first letter is unknown, and the second letter is unknown. But the secret word must have U, S, H in positions 3,4,5 respectively.

So the secret word is of the form X U S H, where X is the first letter. But wait, the second letter is not in the feedback. Wait, the second letter in FLUSH is L, which got an x, meaning L is not in the word. So the secret word doesn't have L. Also, the first letter F is x, so F is not in the word. So the secret word is a 5-letter word where the third letter is U, fourth is S, fifth is H. The first and second letters are unknown, but they can't be F, L, A, C, R, N, E (from the first feedback) or any letters that are in FLUSH except U, S, H. Wait, but the second feedback says that U, S, H are correct in their positions. So the secret word must have U in position 3, S in 4, H in 5. So the first two letters are unknown, but they can't be any of the letters that were in the first guess (C, R, A, N, E) or in the second guess except U, S, H. Wait, the second guess's letters are F, L, U, S, H. The feedback says U, S, H are correct, so the secret word has those letters. So the first and second letters of the secret word can't be F or L, since they were marked as x. Also, the secret word can't have any of the letters from the first guess (C, R, A, N, E). So the first two letters must be letters not in {C, R, A, N, E, F, L}.

So possible letters for first and second positions: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Wait, but H is already in position 5. Wait, the secret word has H in position 5. So H is allowed. But the first and second letters can be any letters except those in the forbidden set. Let me think of possible letters.

So the secret word is _ _ U S H. The first two letters are unknown. Let's think of possible words. For example, ""BUSHY"" but that has Y. But the fifth letter is H. Wait, ""BUSHY"" is B U S H Y. But the fifth letter here is Y, but the secret word's fifth letter is H. So that's not matching. Wait, the secret word is _ _ U S H. So the fifth letter is H, fourth is S, third is U. So the word is something like ""BUSSH""? No, that's not a word. Or ""DUSHY""? No. Wait, maybe ""DUSHY"" is not a word. Alternatively, ""MUSHY"" is M U S H Y. But that has Y as fifth letter, which conflicts with the H. So that's not right.

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""BUSSH""? But that's not a valid word. Alternatively, ""BUSHY"" is B U S H Y. But the fifth letter is Y, not H. So that's not matching. Wait, the secret word must have H as the fifth letter. So the word is _ _ U S H. Let me think of words that end with U S H. For example, ""BUSH"" is four letters. Maybe ""BUSHY"" but that's five letters. But the fifth letter is Y. Hmm. Alternatively, ""THUSH""? Not a word. ""THUSH"" is slang for a type of drink, but maybe not. Alternatively, ""DUSH"" is a word, but that's four letters. Wait, maybe the secret word is ""BUSSH""? No. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""BUSH"" plus a letter. Wait, maybe ""BUSH"" is part of the word. But the third letter is U, fourth S, fifth H. So the word is _ U S H. So the first two letters are unknown. Let me think of possible words.

Wait, maybe the first letter is T, making ""TUSH"" but that's four letters. Or ""TUSHY""? No. Alternatively, ""DUSH"" is D U S H, but that's four letters. Wait, the secret word is five letters. So maybe ""DUSHY"" but that's D U S H Y. But the fifth letter is Y, not H. So that's not matching. Hmm. Maybe the secret word is ""BUSSH""? Not a valid word. Alternatively, ""MUSHY"" is M U S H Y. But again, the fifth letter is Y. So that's not matching. Wait, maybe the secret word is ""BUSH"" with an extra letter. But the fifth letter must be H. So maybe ""BUSH"" is part of the word, but the fifth letter is H. So the word is _ _ U S H. Let's think of possible words. Maybe ""DUSHY"" is not correct. Alternatively, ""THUSH"" is a word? Maybe not. Alternatively, ""BUSSH"" is not a word. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""BUSH"" with an extra letter. Wait, but the fifth letter is H. So maybe ""BUSH"" is the first four letters, but that's four letters. Wait, the secret word is five letters. So the third letter is U, fourth S, fifth H. So the first two letters are unknown. Let me think of words that have U as the third letter, S as fourth, H as fifth. For example, ""BUCKS"" but that's B U C K S. No, the third letter is C, which is forbidden. Wait, the first guess had A, which is forbidden. So the secret word can't have A. So the third letter is U, fourth S, fifth H. So the word is _ _ U S H. Let me think of possible words. Maybe ""BUSHY"" is B U S H Y. But that's Y as fifth letter. Not H. Alternatively, ""BUSH"" is four letters. Maybe ""BUSH"" plus a letter. But the fifth letter must be H. So maybe ""BUSSH""? Not a valid word. Alternatively, ""DUSH"" is four letters. Maybe ""DUSHY"" is D U S H Y. But again, fifth letter Y. Not H. Hmm. Maybe the secret word is ""BUSSH"" but that's not a valid word. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""BUSH"" with an extra letter. Wait, maybe ""BUSH"" is part of the word, but the fifth letter is H. So the word is _ _ U S H. Let me think of words that end with U S H. For example, ""THUSH"" is a term, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, ""SHUSH"" is S H U S H. But that's S H U S H. But the third letter would be U, fourth S, fifth H. Wait, SHUSH is S H U S H. So the third letter is U, fourth S, fifth H. That fits. But the first two letters are S and H. But the secret word is five letters. Wait, SHUSH is S H U S H. So that's five letters. But the first letter is S, second H, third U, fourth S, fifth H. But in this case, the secret word would be SHUSH. However, the second guess was FLUSH, which had letters F, L, U, S, H. The feedback for FLUSH was F(x), L(x), U(✓), S(✓), H(✓). So that means the secret word has U in position 3, S in position 4, and H in position 5. So SHUSH would have U in position 3, S in position 4, H in position 5. But the first letter is S and second is H. However, the secret word's first letter is S, which is allowed because the first guess had F (x), so S is allowed. But wait, the secret word is SHUSH. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, ""shush"" is a word meaning to silence. But the secret word is five letters. Wait, SHUSH is five letters: S, H, U, S, H. But that's five letters. However, the first guess was CRANE, which had no letters correct. The secret word SHUSH would have letters S, H, U, S, H. But the first guess was CRANE, which has C, R, A, N, E. None of those letters are in SHUSH, so that's okay. Then the second guess was FLUSH (F, L, U, S, H), which has U, S, H in the correct positions. So that matches the feedback. So the secret word is SHUSH. But wait, the user's feedback for the second guess was F(x), L(x), U(✓), S(✓), H(✓). So that's correct. So the secret word is SHUSH. But the user hasn't revealed that yet. So now, the next step is to guess a word that fits the pattern _ _ U S H. So the first two letters are unknown. Let's think of possible words. Maybe ""BUSSH"" is not a word. ""DUSHY"" is not. ""THUSH"" is a word? Maybe. Or ""SHUSH"". But that's SHUSH. However, the first two letters would be S and H. But the second letter is H. But in the second guess, the second letter was L, which was marked as x. So the secret word doesn't have L. But H is allowed. So SHUSH is possible. But how to confirm? Since the secret word is SHUSH, then the third letter is U, fourth S, fifth H. So the first two letters are S and H. So the word is SHUSH. But the user hasn't told us yet. So maybe the next guess should be a word that fits the pattern. Let's think of possible words. For example, ""SHUSH"" is a valid word. But the first two letters are S and H. So if I guess ""SHUSH"", then the feedback would be S(✓), H(✓), U(✓), S(✓), H(✓). But since the secret word is SHUSH, that would be correct. But the user hasn't told us yet. So maybe the next guess is SHUSH. But I need to make sure that the first two letters are not in the forbidden set. The forbidden letters from the first two guesses are C, R, A, N, E, F, L. So S and H are allowed. So SHUSH is a valid guess. But wait, the secret word is SHUSH, so the guess would be correct. But the user might have a different word. Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""BUSSH"", but that's not a valid word. Alternatively, ""DUSHY"" is not. Hmm. So perhaps the next guess is SHUSH. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, SHUSH is a valid 5-letter word. So the next guess would be SHUSH. Let me check the letters. S, H, U, S, H. The third letter is U, fourth S, fifth H. So that fits the feedback from the second guess. So the third guess would be SHUSH. If that's the secret word, then the feedback would be all ✓. But if not, then the feedback would indicate which letters are correct or not. So I think that's the best guess here.

<guess>SHUSH</guess>",SHUSH,"Okay, let's see. The user has given feedback for two guesses. The first guess was CRANE, which had all letters incorrect. The second guess was FLUSH, and the feedback was F(x), L(x), U(✓), S(✓), H(✓). So that means the secret word has U, S, and H in the correct positions. Wait, no—the feedback symbols indicate whether each letter is correct in position (✓), present but wrong position (-), or not present (x). So for FLUSH, the letters U, S, H are correct in their positions? Wait, no. Wait, the feedback for FLUSH is F(x), L(x), U(✓), S(✓), H(✓). So that means U is in the correct position (third letter?), S is in the correct position (fourth?), and H is in the correct position (fifth?).

Wait, the secret word is 5 letters. Let me check the positions. For FLUSH, the letters are F (1st), L (2nd), U (3rd), S (4th), H (5th). The feedback says U(✓), S(✓), H(✓). So that means the secret word has U in position 3, S in position 4, and H in position 5. So the secret word is _ U S H. Wait, but the third letter is U, fourth is S, fifth is H. So the word so far is _ U S H. The first letter is unknown, and the second letter is unknown. But the secret word must have U, S, H in positions 3,4,5 respectively.

So the secret word is of the form X U S H, where X is the first letter. But wait, the second letter is not in the feedback. Wait, the second letter in FLUSH is L, which got an x, meaning L is not in the word. So the secret word doesn't have L. Also, the first letter F is x, so F is not in the word. So the secret word is a 5-letter word where the third letter is U, fourth is S, fifth is H. The first and second letters are unknown, but they can't be F, L, A, C, R, N, E (from the first feedback) or any letters that are in FLUSH except U, S, H. Wait, but the second feedback says that U, S, H are correct in their positions. So the secret word must have U in position 3, S in 4, H in 5. So the first two letters are unknown, but they can't be any of the letters that were in the first guess (C, R, A, N, E) or in the second guess except U, S, H. Wait, the second guess's letters are F, L, U, S, H. The feedback says U, S, H are correct, so the secret word has those letters. So the first and second letters of the secret word can't be F or L, since they were marked as x. Also, the secret word can't have any of the letters from the first guess (C, R, A, N, E). So the first two letters must be letters not in {C, R, A, N, E, F, L}.

So possible letters for first and second positions: B, D, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Wait, but H is already in position 5. Wait, the secret word has H in position 5. So H is allowed. But the first and second letters can be any letters except those in the forbidden set. Let me think of possible letters.

So the secret word is _ _ U S H. The first two letters are unknown. Let's think of possible words. For example, ""BUSHY"" but that has Y. But the fifth letter is H. Wait, ""BUSHY"" is B U S H Y. But the fifth letter here is Y, but the secret word's fifth letter is H. So that's not matching. Wait, the secret word is _ _ U S H. So the fifth letter is H, fourth is S, third is U. So the word is something like ""BUSSH""? No, that's not a word. Or ""DUSHY""? No. Wait, maybe ""DUSHY"" is not a word. Alternatively, ""MUSHY"" is M U S H Y. But that has Y as fifth letter, which conflicts with the H. So that's not right.

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""BUSSH""? But that's not a valid word. Alternatively, ""BUSHY"" is B U S H Y. But the fifth letter is Y, not H. So that's not matching. Wait, the secret word must have H as the fifth letter. So the word is _ _ U S H. Let me think of words that end with U S H. For example, ""BUSH"" is four letters. Maybe ""BUSHY"" but that's five letters. But the fifth letter is Y. Hmm. Alternatively, ""THUSH""? Not a word. ""THUSH"" is slang for a type of drink, but maybe not.

Wait, maybe the first letter is T, making ""TUSH"" but that's four letters. Or ""TUSHY""? No. Alternatively, ""DUSH"" is D U S H, but that's four letters. Wait, the secret word is five letters. So maybe ""DUSHY"" but that's D U S H Y. But the fifth letter is Y, not H. So that's not matching. Hmm. Maybe the secret word is ""BUSSH""? Not a valid word. Alternatively, ""MUSHY"" is M U S H Y.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""BUSH"" with an extra letter. Wait, but the fifth letter is H. So maybe ""BUSH"" is the first four letters, but that's four letters.
