Okay, let's see. I need to guess a 5-letter word. The user hasn't given any feedback yet, so this is my first try. I should pick a common 5-letter word that's probably a good starting point. Maybe something like ""CRANE"" or ""BRAIN""? Wait, but I should think about words that have a good mix of letters that could be in the secret word. Alternatively, maybe ""STARS"" or ""PLANT""? Hmm. Let me think of a word that's common and has letters that are likely to be in the secret word. Maybe ""CRATE""? Or ""TRIUM""? Wait, but I need to make sure it's a valid 5-letter English word. Let me check. ""CRANE"" is valid. ""BRAVE"" is also valid. Maybe ""BRAVE"" is a good first guess because it has letters that are common in many words. Alternatively, ""CRANE"" might be better. Wait, but without any feedback, it's hard to know. Maybe I should go with ""CRANE"" as the first guess. Let me confirm that it's a valid 5-letter word. Yes, CRANE is a 5-letter word.

Okay, let me try to figure out the secret word based on the feedback from my first guess, ""CRANE"". The feedback was C(-), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x). So that means:

- C is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A is not in the word at all.
- N is not in the word at all.
- E is not in the word at all.

So, the secret word doesn't have A, N, or E. It does have C and R, but not in the positions they were in my first guess. Let me note that down.

So the letters we know are: C and R must be in the word, but not in positions 1 or 2 (since in ""CRANE"", C was first and R was second, but the feedback says they are in the wrong position). Therefore, C could be in position 3, 4, or 5, and R could be in position 3, 4, or 5 as well. But since the word is 5 letters, and we have two letters (C and R) that must be present, the other three letters must be different and not A, N, or E.

So possible letters to consider: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But need to pick three more letters that are not A, N, E.

Let me think of words that include C and R, and have three other letters from the allowed set. Let's think of possible words.

For example, ""CRATE"" but that has A, which is excluded. So no. ""CRUMB"" has U, B, M. But does that fit? Wait, the secret word can't have A, N, E. So ""CRUMB"" has C, R, U, B, M. That's possible. But I need to check if that's a valid word. Yes, ""crumb"" is a 5-letter word.

Alternatively, ""CRISP"" has C, R, I, S, P. But that's possible. But I need to check if those letters are allowed. Since the secret word can't have A, N, E, so I, S, P are okay.

Another option: ""CRACK"" but that has two A's, which are excluded. So no.

How about ""CRANE"" was the first guess, but A and N are excluded. So maybe ""CRUMB"", ""CRISP"", ""CROSS"" (but that has two S's and O, which is allowed? Wait, O is allowed. But the secret word can't have A, N, E. So O is okay. But ""CROSS"" has two O's and S, but that's allowed. However, the secret word has to be 5 letters. Wait, ""CROSS"" is 5 letters. But does that fit? Let me check the letters. C, R, O, S, S. But the secret word can't have A, N, E. So that's okay. But the feedback from the first guess says that E is not in the word. So ""CROSS"" is possible. But I need to think of a word that includes C and R, and other letters not in the excluded set.

Alternatively, ""CRATE"" is out because of A. ""CRANE"" is out because of A and N. ""CRUMB"" is possible. ""CRISP"" is possible. ""CROSS"" is possible. ""CRAWL"" has A, which is excluded. So no. ""CRAWL"" is out. ""CRUEL"" has U, E, L. But E is excluded. So no. ""CRUEL"" is out. ""CRUST"" has U, S, T. That's allowed. So ""CRUST"" is possible. Let me think of other words.

Another approach: Since C and R are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2, maybe the word is something like ""R...C..."" or ""C...R..."", but that's not necessarily. Wait, the positions of C and R in the secret word could be anywhere else. For example, maybe C is in position 3 and R in position 4, or R in position 3 and C in position 4, etc.

Let me think of possible words. ""CRUMB"" has C in position 1, but the feedback said C is in the wrong position. Wait, in the first guess, C was in position 1, but the feedback says C is in the word but in the wrong position. So the secret word must have C, but not in position 1. So C can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. Wait, no. Wait, the feedback for C was (-), meaning it's in the word but in the wrong position. So in the first guess, C was in position 1. So the secret word has C, but not in position 1. So C could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. Similarly for R: in the first guess, R was in position 2, but the feedback says R is in the word but in the wrong position. So R is in the secret word but not in position 2. So R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

So possible positions for C and R: C can be in 2,3,4,5; R can be in 1,3,4,5. Let's try to find a word that fits.

Let me think of words that have C and R in different positions. For example, ""RANCH"" has R in position 1 and A, N, C, H. But A and N are excluded, so that's out. ""RANCH"" is invalid. ""RICEY"" has R, but that's 5 letters. Wait, but the secret word can't have E. So ""RICEY"" has E, which is excluded. No. ""RICES"" has E. No. ""RICKS"" has C, R, I, K, S. That's possible. Let's check: R is in position 1, C is in position 3. So that would fit. The letters are R, I, C, K, S. None of A, N, E. So that's allowed. ""RICKS"" is a valid word. So that's a possibility.

Alternatively, ""RICES"" is invalid because of E. ""RICES"" is out. ""RICES"" has E. So no. ""RICES"" is not allowed.

Another word: ""CRICK"" is 5 letters? No, CRICK is 5 letters? C-R-I-C-K. Wait, that's 5 letters. But the secret word can't have A, N, E. So that's allowed. But ""CRICK"" is a word? Maybe. But I'm not sure if that's a valid word. Alternatively, ""CRICK"" might not be a standard word. Maybe ""CRICK"" is a variant, but perhaps ""CRICK"" is not a common word. Let me think of other words.

How about ""CROSS""? C in position 1, but the feedback says C is in the wrong position. Wait, in the first guess, C was in position 1, and the feedback says it's in the wrong position. So the secret word can't have C in position 1. Therefore, ""CROSS"" would have C in position 1, which is invalid. So that's out.

So ""RICKS"" is a possibility. Let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, ""ricks"" is a plural of ""rick"", which is a term for a stack of hay. So that's acceptable.

Alternatively, ""CRISP"" has C and R. Let's see: C is in position 1, but the secret word can't have C in position 1. So that's invalid. So ""CRISP"" is out. So the C must be in positions 2,3,4,5. So if the secret word is ""RICKS"", then C is in position 3, which is allowed.

Alternatively, ""RICKS"" is a possible word. Let me think of other words. ""RICES"" is out. ""RICKS"" is possible. Another option: ""RICES"" is out. ""RICES"" has E. So no. ""RICKS"" is better.

Alternatively, ""RICES"" is invalid. What about ""RICES"" is invalid. Another option: ""RICES"" is not allowed. So ""RICKS"" is a possible guess.

Alternatively, ""RICKS"" is a valid word. So maybe that's the next guess. But I need to make sure that the letters are not in the excluded set. Let me check: R, I, C, K, S. None of A, N, E. So that's okay.

So my next guess would be ""RICKS"". But I need to make sure that it's a valid word. Alternatively, maybe ""CRICK"" is a word. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, ""CRISP"" is invalid because of C in position 1. So maybe ""RICKS"" is better.

Alternatively, ""RICKS"" is a valid word. So I'll go with that as my second guess. Let me check if that's a valid 5-letter word. Yes, ""ricks"" is a valid plural noun.

So the second guess is ""RICKS"".
