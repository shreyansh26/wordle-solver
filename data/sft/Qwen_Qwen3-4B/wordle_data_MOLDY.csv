Okay, let's see. I need to guess a 5-letter word, and I have 6 tries. The feedback will tell me which letters are correct, wrong position, or not in the word at all. My first guess should be a word that's common and maybe has some letters that could be part of the secret word.

Hmm, maybe start with a word that's common and has vowels and consonants that are frequently used. Words like ""crane"" or ""apple"" come to mind. Wait, but maybe something like ""crane"" has letters that are more likely to be in the secret word. Alternatively, ""baker"" or ""stare"" could be good. Let me think. Since I don't have any feedback yet, I need a word that's versatile. Maybe ""crane"" is a good first guess because it has a mix of letters that could be in various positions. Alternatively, ""apple"" is another common word. Wait, but maybe ""crane"" is better because it has a 'c', 'r', 'a', 'n', 'e' which are all common letters. Let me go with ""crane"" as the first guess. If that's not right, the feedback will help me adjust. Alternatively, maybe ""stare"" is better. Hmm. Let me pick ""crane"" as the first guess. I think that's a solid starting point.

Okay, so my first guess was ""CRANE"", and the feedback was all x's. That means none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. So I need to think of a different word that doesn't contain any of those letters.

Let me list out the letters I need to avoid: C, R, A, N, E. So the secret word can't have any of these. So possible letters are B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Wait, but it's a 5-letter word. Let me think of words that don't include those letters.

Maybe start with words that have letters like B, D, F, G, etc. Let's think of some 5-letter words. ""BRAKE"" has an A, which is excluded. ""BLAST"" has an A again. Hmm. ""BRAVE"" has A and E. Not good. ""DRIVE"" has I, V, E. E is excluded. ""DRYER"" has E. No. ""FLYER"" has E. ""FLUSH"" has U, S, H. Wait, but ""FLUSH"" has letters F, L, U, S, H. None of those are in the excluded letters. Wait, the excluded letters are C, R, A, N, E. So F, L, U, S, H are okay. So ""FLUSH"" is a possible candidate. But maybe ""FLUSH"" is too common. Alternatively, ""GLIMP"" isn't a word. ""GLIDE"" has I, D, E. E is excluded. ""GLINT"" has I, N. N is excluded. ""GLIMP"" is not a word. ""GLAZE"" has Z, which is allowed. But ""GLAZE"" is 5 letters. Wait, G, L, A, Z, E. Oh, A and E are excluded. So that's no good. 

Wait, maybe ""BLAST"" is out because of A. ""BLAST"" has A. So no. How about ""BLOOM""? B, L, O, O, M. O is allowed. But the secret word can't have any of the excluded letters. Wait, ""BLOOM"" has O, which is okay. But the secret word is 5 letters. Let me think again. Let's try ""BLOOM"" but check if any letters are excluded. B is allowed, L is allowed, O is allowed, O again, M is allowed. So that's okay. But maybe ""BLOOM"" is a possible guess. But I need to make sure that the letters in the secret word are not in the excluded list. Alternatively, ""BLUSH"" has U, S, H. Let me check: B, L, U, S, H. None of those are in the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E). So ""BLUSH"" is a possible word. 

Alternatively, ""DITCH"" has D, I, T, C, H. Wait, C is excluded. So no. ""DITCH"" has a C, which is bad. ""DITCH"" is out. ""DRAFT"" has A, which is excluded. ""DROOP"" has O, P. Wait, D, R, O, O, P. R is excluded. So no. ""DROOP"" is out. ""DROVE"" has E. Excluded. ""DROWN"" has O, W, N. N is excluded. So no. 

How about ""FILMS""? F, I, L, M, S. None of those letters are in the excluded list. That's a valid word. ""FILMS"" is 5 letters. So that's a possibility. Alternatively, ""FILTH"" has T, H. But F, I, L, T, H. All allowed. So ""FILTH"" is another option. 

Alternatively, ""FUDGE"" has U, D, G, E. E is excluded. So no. ""FUDGE"" is out. ""FLEA"" is too short. ""FLUSH"" as mentioned earlier. 

So possible words could be ""BLUSH"", ""FLUSH"", ""FILMS"", ""FILTH"", ""GLIMM"" (not a word). Wait, ""GLIMM"" isn't a word. Maybe ""GLIMP"" is not valid. Let me think again. ""FLUSH"" is a valid word. Let's go with ""FLUSH"" as the second guess. But wait, let me check if ""FLUSH"" has any letters that are excluded. F, L, U, S, H. None of those letters are in the excluded list (C, R, A, N, E). So that's okay. 

Alternatively, ""BLUSH"" is also valid. So maybe ""BLUSH"" is a better choice. Let me pick ""BLUSH"" as the second guess. But I need to make sure that it's a valid 5-letter word. Yes, ""BLUSH"" is a valid word. So that's my second guess.

""BLAST"" has an A again. Hmm. ""BRAVE"" has A and E. Not good. ""DRIVE"" has I, V, E. E is excluded. ""DRYER"" has E. No. ""FLYER"" has E. ""FLUSH"" has U, S, H. Wait, but ""FLUSH"" has letters F, L, U, S, H. None of those are in the excluded letters. Wait, the excluded letters are C, R, A, N, E. So F, L, U, S, H are okay. So ""FLUSH"" is a possible candidate. But maybe ""FLUSH"" is too common. Alternatively, ""GLIMP"" isn\'t a word. ""GLIDE"" has I, D, E. E is excluded. ""GLINT"" has I, N. N is excluded. ""GLIMP"" is not a word. ""GLAZE"" has Z, which is allowed. But ""GLAZE"" is 5 letters. Wait, G, L, A, Z, E. Oh, A and E are excluded. So that\'s no good. \n\nWait, maybe ""BLAST"" is out because of A. ""BLAST"" has A. So no. How about ""BLOOM""? B, L, O, O, M. O is allowed. But the secret word can\'t have any of the excluded letters. Wait, ""BLOOM"" has O, which is okay. But the secret word is 5 letters. Let me think again. Let\'s try ""BLOOM"" but check if any letters are excluded. B is allowed, L is allowed, O is allowed, O again, M is allowed. So that\'s okay. But maybe ""BLOOM"" is a possible guess. But I need to make sure that the letters in the secret word are not in the excluded list. Alternatively, ""BLUSH"" has U, S, H. Let me check: B, L, U, S, H. None of those are in the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E). So ""BLUSH"" is a possible word. \n\nAlternatively, ""DITCH"" has D, I, T, C, H. Wait, C is excluded. So no. ""DITCH"" has a C, which is bad. ""DITCH"" is out. ""DRAFT"" has A, which is excluded. ""DROOP"" has O, P. Wait, D, R, O, O, P. R is excluded. So no. ""DROOP"" is out. ""DROVE"" has E. Excluded. ""DROWN"" has O, W, N. N is excluded. So no. \n\nHow about ""FILMS""? F, I, L, M, S. None of those letters are in the excluded list. That\'s a valid word. ""FILMS"" is 5 letters. So that\'s a possibility. Alternatively, ""FILTH"" has T, H. But F, I, L, T, H. All allowed. So ""FILTH"" is another option. \n\nAlternatively, ""FUDGE"" has U, D, G, E. E is excluded. So no. ""FUDGE"" is out. ""FLEA"" is too short. ""FLUSH"" as mentioned earlier. \n\nSo possible words could be ""BLUSH"", ""FLUSH"", ""FILMS"", ""FILTH"", ""GLIMM"" (not a word). Wait, ""GLIMM"" isn\'t a word. Maybe ""GLIMP"" is not valid. Let me think again. ""FLUSH"" is a valid word. Let\'s go with ""FLUSH"" as the second guess. But wait, let me check if ""FLUSH"" has any letters that are excluded. F, L, U, S, H. None of those letters are in the excluded list (C, R, A, N, E). So that\'s okay. \n\nAlternatively, ""BLUSH"" is also valid. So maybe ""BLUSH"" is a better choice. Let me pick ""BLUSH"" as the second guess. But I need to make sure that it\'s a valid 5-letter word. Yes, ""BLUSH"" is a valid word.

Okay, let me try to figure out the secret word based on the feedback so far. 

First, the first guess was CRANE, and all letters were x, meaning none of C, R, A, N, E are in the word. Then, the second guess was BLUSH, and the feedback was B(x), L(-), U(x), S(x), H(x). So, B is not in the word, U is not in the word, S is not in the word, H is not in the word. But L has a -, which means L is in the word but in the wrong position. 

So from the second guess, we know that L is present but not in the second position. Also, the secret word doesn't contain B, U, S, H. So the letters we can exclude so far are C, R, A, N, E, B, U, S, H. That leaves possible letters: D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. 

But since the secret word is 5 letters, and we know that L is in the word, but not in position 2. Also, the other letters in the secret word must be from the remaining letters. 

So possible letters include L, and others. Let's think of words that have L and don't include any of the excluded letters. Also, since the secret word is 5 letters, maybe words like ""FLAIL"" but check if any letters are excluded. F, L, A, I, L. A is excluded, so no. ""FLAIL"" is out. ""FLAME"" has A and E, which are excluded. ""FLUSH"" was the previous guess, but U and S are excluded. 

Wait, the second guess was BLUSH, and the feedback was L(-). So L is in the word but not in position 2. So the secret word has L, but not in position 2. So possible positions for L are 1, 3, 4, or 5. 

Now, let's think of possible words that include L and other letters not in the excluded list. Let's try ""DROLL"" but that has two L's and O. Wait, D, R, O, L, L. R is excluded. So no. ""DROLL"" is out. ""DOLLY"" has D, O, L, L, Y. O is allowed. But D, O, L, L, Y. Wait, but R is excluded. So D is allowed, O is allowed, L is allowed, Y is allowed. So ""DOLLY"" is a possible word. But let's check if that's possible. 

Alternatively, ""DOLLY"" has L in position 3. But the secret word's L is not in position 2. So that's okay. But I need to check if the secret word could be DOLLY. But maybe there's another word. 

Another possibility is ""DOLLY"" or ""DOLLS"" but that has two L's. Wait, ""DOLLS"" is D, O, L, L, S. S is excluded, so no. 

Alternatively, ""GLOOM"" has G, L, O, O, M. O is allowed. But that's 5 letters. But G, L, O, O, M. None of the excluded letters. But the secret word could be GLOOM. But the feedback from the second guess was L(-), so L is in the word. So that's possible. 

But let's think of other words. Maybe ""GLOOM"" is a possibility. Alternatively, ""GLOWY"" but that's not a standard word. ""GLOVE"" has V, but that's allowed. Wait, G, L, O, V, E. E is excluded. So no. 

Alternatively, ""GLOAM"" is G, L, O, A, M. A is excluded. No. 

Another thought: ""GLIMP"" isn't a word. ""GLAZE"" has A and E. No. 

Wait, maybe ""GLEAN"" but that has A. Excluded. 

Hmm. Let's think again. The secret word has L, and other letters not in the excluded list. Let's try ""DOLLY"" again. D, O, L, L, Y. That's a valid word. But let's check if that's possible. 

Alternatively, ""DOLLY"" is a good candidate. But maybe there's another word. Let's think of ""DOLLY"" as the third guess. But I need to make sure that the letters are allowed. 

Alternatively, ""DOLLY"" is a possible word. Let me check the letters again. D is allowed, O is allowed, L is allowed, Y is allowed. So yes. 

So my third guess could be ""DOLLY"". Let's try that. If that's not correct, the feedback will tell me which letters are correct. 

Alternatively, maybe ""GLOOM"" is better. Let's see. G, L, O, O, M. All allowed letters. 

But I need to choose a word that's likely. Maybe ""DOLLY"" is more common. 

Alternatively, ""GLOOM"" is also possible. Let me pick ""GLOOM"" as the third guess. 

Wait, but the secret word could be ""GLOOM"" or ""DOLLY"". Let me check the letters again. 

Alternatively, maybe ""GLOOM"" is better. Let's go with ""GLOOM"" as the third guess. 

But wait, the secret word could have other letters. Let me think again. 

Another possibility: ""GLOVE"" is out because of E. ""GLIMP"" is not a word. ""GLINT"" has N, which is excluded. 

Alternatively, ""GLOAM"" has A, which is excluded. 

Hmm. So maybe ""DOLLY"" is the best option. 

So my third guess is ""DOLLY"". Let's proceed with that.

Okay, let's see. I need to guess a 5-letter word, and I have 6 tries. The feedback will tell me which letters are correct, wrong position, or not in the word at all. My first guess should be a word that's common and maybe has some letters that could be part of the secret word.

Hmm, maybe start with a word that's common and has vowels and consonants that are frequently used. Words like ""crane"" or ""apple"" come to mind. Wait, but maybe something like ""crane"" has letters that are more likely to be in the secret word. Alternatively, ""baker"" or ""stare"" could be good. Let me think. Since I don't have any feedback yet, I need a word that's versatile. Maybe ""crane"" is a good first guess because it has a mix of letters that could be in various positions. Alternatively, ""apple"" is another common word. Wait, but maybe ""crane"" is better because it has a 'c', 'r', 'a', 'n', 'e' which are all common letters. Let me go with ""crane"" as the first guess. If that's not right, the feedback will help me adjust. Alternatively, maybe ""stare"" is better. Hmm. Let me pick ""crane"" as the first guess. I think that's a solid starting point.

Okay, so my first guess was ""CRANE"", and the feedback was all x's. That means none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. So I need to think of a different word that doesn't contain any of those letters.

Let me list out the letters I need to avoid: C, R, A, N, E. So the secret word can't have any of these. So possible letters are B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Wait, but it's a 5-letter word. Let me think of words that don't include those letters.

Maybe start with words that have letters like B, D, F, G, etc. Let's think of some 5-letter words. ""BRAKE"" has an A, which is excluded. ""BLAST"" has an A again. Hmm. ""BRAVE"" has A and E. Not good. ""DRIVE"" has I, V, E. E is excluded. ""DRYER"" has E. No. ""FLYER"" has E. ""FLUSH"" has U, S, H. Wait, but ""FLUSH"" has letters F, L, U, S, H. None of those are in the excluded letters. Wait, the excluded letters are C, R, A, N, E. So F, L, U, S, H are okay. So ""FLUSH"" is a possible candidate. But maybe ""FLUSH"" is too common. Alternatively, ""GLIMP"" isn't a word. ""GLIDE"" has I, D, E. E is excluded. ""GLINT"" has I, N. N is excluded. ""GLIMP"" is not a word. ""GLAZE"" has Z, which is allowed. But ""GLAZE"" is 5 letters. Wait, G, L, A, Z, E. Oh, A and E are excluded. So that's no good. 

Wait, maybe ""BLAST"" is out because of A. ""BLAST"" has A. So no. How about ""BLOOM""? B, L, O, O, M. O is allowed. But the secret word can't have any of the excluded letters. Wait, ""BLOOM"" has O, which is okay. But the secret word is 5 letters. Let me think again. Let's try ""BLOOM"" but check if any letters are excluded. B is allowed, L is allowed, O is allowed, O again, M is allowed. So that's okay. But maybe ""BLOOM"" is a possible guess. But I need to make sure that the letters in the secret word are not in the excluded list. Alternatively, ""BLUSH"" has U, S, H. Let me check: B, L, U, S, H. None of those are in the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E). So ""BLUSH"" is a possible word. 

Alternatively, ""DITCH"" has D, I, T, C, H. Wait, C is excluded. So no. ""DITCH"" has a C, which is bad. ""DITCH"" is out. ""DRAFT"" has A, which is excluded. ""DROOP"" has O, P. Wait, D, R, O, O, P. R is excluded. So no. ""DROOP"" is out. ""DROVE"" has E. Excluded. ""DROWN"" has O, W, N. N is excluded. So no. 

How about ""FILMS""? F, I, L, M, S. None of those letters are in the excluded list. That's a valid word. ""FILMS"" is 5 letters. So that's a possibility. Alternatively, ""FILTH"" has T, H. But F, I, L, T, H. All allowed. So ""FILTH"" is another option. 

Alternatively, ""FUDGE"" has U, D, G, E. E is excluded. So no. ""FUDGE"" is out. ""FLEA"" is too short. ""FLUSH"" as mentioned earlier. 

So possible words could be ""BLUSH"", ""FLUSH"", ""FILMS"", ""FILTH"", ""GLIMM"" (not a word). Wait, ""GLIMM"" isn't a word. Maybe ""GLIMP"" is not valid. Let me think again. ""FLUSH"" is a valid word. Let's go with ""FLUSH"" as the second guess. But wait, let me check if ""FLUSH"" has any letters that are excluded. F, L, U, S, H.

Alternatively, ""BLUSH"" is also valid. So maybe ""BLUSH"" is a better choice. Let me pick ""BLUSH"" as the second guess. But I need to make sure that it's a valid 5-letter word. Yes, ""BLUSH"" is a valid word. So that's my second guess.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Okay, let me try to figure out the secret word based on the feedback so far. 

First, the first guess was CRANE, and all letters were x, meaning none of C, R, A, N, E are in the word. Then, the second guess was BLUSH, and the feedback was B(x), L(-), U(x), S(x), H(x). So, B is not in the word, U is not in the word, S is not in the word, H is not in the word. But L has a -, which means L is in the word but in the wrong position. 

So from the second guess, we know that L is present but not in the second position. Also, the secret word doesn't contain B, U, S, H. So the letters we can exclude so far are C, R, A, N, E, B, U, S, H. That leaves possible letters: D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. 

But since the secret word is 5 letters, and we know that L is in the word, but not in position 2. Also, the other letters in the secret word must be from the remaining letters. 

So possible letters include L, and others. Let's think of words that have L and don't include any of the excluded letters. Also, since the secret word is 5 letters, maybe words like ""FLAIL"" but check if any letters are excluded. F, L, A, I, L. A is excluded, so no. ""FLAIL"" is out. ""FLAME"" has A and E, which are excluded. ""FLUSH"" was the previous guess, but U and S are excluded. 

Wait, the second guess was BLUSH, and the feedback was L(-). So L is in the word but not in position 2. So the secret word has L, but not in position 2. So possible positions for L are 1, 3, 4, or 5. 

Now, let's think of possible words that include L and other letters not in the excluded list. Let's try ""DROLL"" but that has two L's and O. Wait, D, R, O, L, L. R is excluded. So no. ""DROLL"" is out. ""DOLLY"" has D, O, L, L, Y. O is allowed. But D, O, L, L, Y. Wait, but R is excluded. So D is allowed, O is allowed, L is allowed, Y is allowed. So ""DOLLY"" is a possible word. But let's check if that's possible. 

Alternatively, ""DOLLY"" has L in position 3. But the secret word's L is not in position 2. So that's okay. But I need to check if the secret word could be DOLLY. But maybe there's another word. 

Another possibility is ""DOLLY"" or ""DOLLS"" but that has two L's. Wait, ""DOLLS"" is D, O, L, L, S. S is excluded, so no. 

Alternatively, ""GLOOM"" has G, L, O, O, M. O is allowed. But that's 5 letters. But G, L, O, O, M. None of the excluded letters. But the secret word could be GLOOM. But the feedback from the second guess was L(-), so L is in the word. So that's possible. 

But let's think of other words. Maybe ""GLOOM"" is a possibility. Alternatively, ""GLOWY"" but that's not a standard word. ""GLOVE"" has V, but that's allowed. Wait, G, L, O, V, E. E is excluded. So no. 

Alternatively, ""GLOAM"" is G, L, O, A, M. A is excluded. No. 

Another thought: ""GLIMP"" isn't a word. ""GLAZE"" has A and E. No. 

Wait, maybe ""GLEAN"" but that has A. Excluded. 

Hmm. Let's think again. The secret word has L, and other letters not in the excluded list. Let's try ""DOLLY"" again. D, O, L, L, Y. That's a valid word. But let's check if that's possible. 

Alternatively, ""DOLLY"" is a good candidate. But maybe there's another word. Let's think of ""DOLLY"" as the third guess. But I need to make sure that the letters are allowed. 

Alternatively, ""DOLLY"" is a possible word. Let me check the letters again. D is allowed, O is allowed, L is allowed, Y is allowed. So yes. 

So my third guess could be ""DOLLY"". Let's try that. If that's not correct, the feedback will tell me which letters are correct. 

Alternatively, maybe ""GLOOM"" is better. Let's see. G, L, O, O, M. All allowed letters. 

But I need to choose a word that's likely. Maybe ""DOLLY"" is more common. 

Alternatively, ""GLOOM"" is also possible. Let me pick ""GLOOM"" as the third guess. 

Wait, but the secret word could be ""GLOOM"" or ""DOLLY"". Let me check the letters again. 

Alternatively, maybe ""GLOOM"" is better. Let's go with ""GLOOM"" as the third guess. 

But wait, the secret word could have other letters. Let me think again. 

Another possibility: ""GLOVE"" is out because of E. ""GLIMP"" is not a word. ""GLINT"" has N, which is excluded. 

Alternatively, ""GLOAM"" has A, which is excluded. 

Hmm. So maybe ""DOLLY"" is the best option. 

So my third guess is ""DOLLY"". Let's proceed with that.

So possible letters are B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Wait, but it\'s a 5-letter word. Let me think of words that don\'t include those letters.\n\nMaybe start with words that have letters like B, D, F, G, etc. Let\'s think of some 5-letter words. ""BRAKE"" has an A, which is excluded.

So ""FLUSH"" is a possible candidate. But maybe ""FLUSH"" is too common. Alternatively, ""GLIMP"" isn\'t a word. ""GLIDE"" has I, D, E. E is excluded. ""GLINT"" has I, N. N is excluded. ""GLIMP"" is not a word. ""GLAZE"" has Z, which is allowed. But ""GLAZE"" is 5 letters. Wait, G, L, A, Z, E. Oh, A and E are excluded. So that\'s no good. \n\nWait, maybe ""BLAST"" is out because of A. ""BLAST"" has A. So no. How about ""BLOOM""? B, L, O, O, M. O is allowed. But the secret word can\'t have any of the excluded letters. Wait, ""BLOOM"" has O, which is okay. But the secret word is 5 letters. Let me think again. Let\'s try ""BLOOM"" but check if any letters are excluded. B is allowed, L is allowed, O is allowed, O again, M is allowed. So that\'s okay. But maybe ""BLOOM"" is a possible guess. But I need to make sure that the letters in the secret word are not in the excluded list. Alternatively, ""BLUSH"" has U, S, H. Let me check: B, L, U, S, H. None of those are in the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E). So ""BLUSH"" is a possible word. \n\nAlternatively, ""DITCH"" has D, I, T, C, H. Wait, C is excluded. So no. ""DITCH"" has a C, which is bad. ""DITCH"" is out. ""DRAFT"" has A, which is excluded. ""DROOP"" has O, P. Wait, D, R, O, O, P. R is excluded. So no. ""DROOP"" is out. ""DROVE"" has E. Excluded. ""DROWN"" has O, W, N. N is excluded. So no. \n\nHow about ""FILMS""? F, I, L, M, S. None of those letters are in the excluded list. That\'s a valid word. ""FILMS"" is 5 letters. So that\'s a possibility. Alternatively, ""FILTH"" has T, H. But F, I, L, T, H. All allowed. So ""FILTH"" is another option. \n\nAlternatively, ""FUDGE"" has U, D, G, E. E is excluded. So no. ""FUDGE"" is out. ""FLEA"" is too short. ""FLUSH"" as mentioned earlier. \n\nSo possible words could be ""BLUSH"", ""FLUSH"", ""FILMS"", ""FILTH"", ""GLIMM"" (not a word). Wait, ""GLIMM"" isn\'t a word. Maybe ""GLIMP"" is not valid. Let me think again. ""FLUSH"" is a valid word. Let\'s go with ""FLUSH"" as the second guess. But wait, let me check if ""FLUSH"" has any letters that are excluded. F, L, U, S, H. None of those letters are in the excluded list (C, R, A, N, E). So that\'s okay. \n\nAlternatively, ""BLUSH"" is also valid. So maybe ""BLUSH"" is a better choice. Let me pick ""BLUSH"" as the second guess. But I need to make sure that it\'s a valid 5-letter word. Yes, ""BLUSH"" is a valid word.

Okay, let's break down the feedback step by step. 

First, the secret word is a 5-letter word. The first guess was CRANE, and all letters were x, meaning none of C, R, A, N, E are in the word. Then, the second guess was BLUSH, which gave feedback: B(x), L(-), U(x), S(x), H(x). So B is out, U, S, H are out, but L is present but in the wrong position. 

Third guess was DOLLY, and the feedback was D(-), O(✓), L(✓), L(-), Y(✓). So D is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's a -), O is correct and in the right position (✓), L is correct but in the wrong position (since the second L is a -), and Y is correct and in the right position (✓). Wait, let me check that again. The feedback for DOLLY is D(-), O(✓), L(✓), L(-), Y(✓). 

So, D is in the word but not in position 1 (since it's a -). O is in the correct position (position 2). L is in the word but not in position 3 (since the third letter is L with a -). Wait, the third letter of DOLLY is L, and the feedback is L(✓) for the third position? Wait, no, the feedback for DOLLY is D(-) O(✓) L(✓) L(-) Y(✓). Wait, that can't be right. Let me parse it again. 

The guess was DOLLY, which is D (1), O (2), L (3), L (4), Y (5). The feedback is D(-), O(✓), L(✓), L(-), Y(✓). So:

- D is in the word but in the wrong position (so D is present but not in position 1).
- O is correct and in the right position (position 2 is O, which is correct).
- L is correct but in the wrong position (position 3 is L, but the feedback is L(✓), which might mean that L is in the word but not in position 3? Wait, the feedback symbols are for each letter in the guess. So for the third letter (L), the feedback is L(✓), meaning that the letter L is in the word and in the correct position. But that contradicts the previous feedback from BLUSH where L was in the word but in the wrong position. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, the feedback for the third guess DOLLY is D(-), O(✓), L(✓), L(-), Y(✓). So:

- D is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's a -).
- O is in the correct position (position 2 is O, so it's correct).
- L is in the correct position (position 3 is L, so it's correct? But that would mean that L is in the correct position. But earlier, from BLUSH, we had L in the word but in the wrong position (position 2). Wait, but BLUSH was the second guess, where the feedback was L(-), meaning that L is in the word but in the wrong position. So if in the third guess, DOLLY, the third letter is L with a ✓, that would mean that L is in the correct position. But that's conflicting with the previous feedback where L was in the wrong position. Wait, that can't be. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the feedback. Let me recheck.

Wait, the feedback for the third guess DOLLY is D(-) O(✓) L(✓) L(-) Y(✓). So:

- D is in the word but in the wrong position (so D is present but not in position 1).
- O is correct and in the right position (position 2 is O, so that's correct).
- L is correct and in the right position (position 3 is L, so that's correct).
- The fourth letter is L with a -, meaning that L is in the word but in the wrong position (so the fourth L is not correct, but the third L is correct? Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe the feedback is that for each letter in the guess, if it's in the correct position, it's ✓, if in the word but wrong position, it's -, and if not in the word, it's x. So for DOLLY:

- D is in the word but not in position 1 (so D is present but in another position).
- O is in the correct position (position 2).
- L is in the correct position (position 3).
- The fourth letter is L, but the feedback is -, meaning that the L in position 4 is in the word but in the wrong position. Wait, but if the third position is L with ✓, that would mean that L is in the correct position. But if the fourth L is -, that would mean that the fourth L is in the word but in the wrong position. That's possible if there are two Ls in the word, but one is in position 3 (correct) and the other is in position 4 (wrong). But that would mean that the secret word has two Ls, one in position 3 and another in position 4. But that's conflicting with the previous feedback where L was in the word but in the wrong position (from BLUSH, where L was in position 2, but the feedback was L(-), meaning that L is in the word but not in position 2. So if the secret word has L in position 3, that's correct, and if there's another L in position 4, that would be wrong. But that's possible. 

But this is getting complicated. Let me try to extract the information:

From the third guess DOLLY, the feedback is:

- D is present but not in position 1.
- O is correct and in position 2.
- L is correct and in position 3.
- The fourth L is present but not in position 4.
- Y is correct and in position 5.

Wait, but that would mean that the secret word has O in position 2, L in position 3, Y in position 5. Also, D is present but not in position 1. And there's another L in the word, but not in position 4. So the secret word has O, L, Y, and D, and another L. But that would make the word have two Ls. Let me think: the secret word is 5 letters. So far, we have O in position 2, L in position 3, Y in position 5. Also, D is present but not in position 1. And another L is present but not in position 4. So possible letters are O, L, Y, D, and another L. So the secret word would be D O L L Y? But that's DOLLY, which was the guess. But the feedback for DOLLY was D(-), O(✓), L(✓), L(-), Y(✓). Wait, that would mean that the secret word is DOLLY, but the feedback for the third guess is D(-) which implies D is in the word but not in position 1. But in DOLLY, D is in position 1. So that's conflicting. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my interpretation. 

Wait, maybe the feedback for DOLLY is D(-), O(✓), L(✓), L(-), Y(✓). So:

- D is in the word but not in position 1 (so D is present but in another position).
- O is correct and in position 2.
- L is correct and in position 3.
- The fourth L is in the word but not in position 4 (so the fourth L is in another position, but the third L is correct).
- Y is correct and in position 5.

So the secret word must have O in position 2, L in position 3, Y in position 5. Also, D is present but not in position 1. And another L is present but not in position 4. So the secret word could be D O L L Y, but the D is in position 1, which contradicts the feedback for D being in the wrong position. Therefore, this suggests that the secret word is not DOLLY, but another word that includes O, L, Y, D, and another L. But that's not possible because DOLLY is the only 5-letter word with those letters. 

This is confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in the feedback interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the secret word is ""DOLLY"", and the feedback for D is a - because D is in the word but not in position 1. But in DOLLY, D is in position 1. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, maybe the feedback is different. 

Alternatively, maybe the feedback for DOLLY is D(-) meaning that D is in the word but not in position 1, which would mean that D is in another position. But if the secret word is DOLLY, then D is in position 1. So that's conflicting. Therefore, perhaps the secret word is not DOLLY, but another word that has O, L, Y, and D, but with the L in a different position. 

Wait, let me think again. From the previous feedback:

- From BLUSH: L is in the word but not in position 2.
- From DOLLY: O is in position 2 (correct), L is in position 3 (correct), Y is in position 5 (correct). Also, D is in the word but not in position 1. 

So the secret word must have O in position 2, L in position 3, Y in position 5. Also, D is present but not in position 1. And there's another L in the word, but not in position 4. 

So the secret word is something like D _ L _ Y. But the second letter is O. So the word is D O L _ Y. The fourth letter is L? But that would make it D O L L Y, which is DOLLY. But the feedback for D in DOLLY is -, which would mean that D is not in position 1. But in DOLLY, D is in position 1. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. 

This suggests that maybe the feedback for DOLLY is incorrect, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the feedback. Let me re-express the feedback for DOLLY:

Guess 3: DOLLY -> FEEDBACK: D(-) O(✓) L(✓) L(-) Y(✓)

So each letter in DOLLY is evaluated:

- D (position 1): - → D is in the word but not in position 1.
- O (position 2): ✓ → O is in the word and in the correct position.
- L (position 3): ✓ → L is in the word and in the correct position.
- L (position 4): - → L is in the word but not in position 4.
- Y (position 5): ✓ → Y is in the word and in the correct position.

So the secret word must have O in position 2, L in position 3, Y in position 5. Also, D is in the word but not in position 1. And there's another L in the word, but not in position 4. 

So the secret word has O, L, Y, D, and another L. But that would make it D O L L Y (DOLLY), but D is in position 1, which contradicts the feedback for D being in the wrong position. Therefore, this suggests that the secret word is not DOLLY. But how?

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""DOLLY"", and the feedback for D is a - because D is in the word but not in position 1. But in DOLLY, D is in position 1. So this is impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in my reasoning. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word has D in position 4, not 1. So the word would be _ O L _ Y, with D in position 4. So the word could be ""D O L D Y""? But that's not a valid word. Or ""D O L L Y"" is DOLLY, but that would have D in position 1. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""DOLL Y"", but that's two words. 

This is confusing. Maybe I need to adjust my approach. Let's list what we know so far:

- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, B, U, S, H.
- Letters that are in the word: O (position 2), L (position 3), Y (position 5), D (not in position 1), and another L (not in position 4).

So the secret word has O, L, Y, D, and another L. But that's 5 letters. So the word would be D O L L Y (DOLLY), but the feedback for D being in position 1 is conflicting. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my interpretation. 

Wait, maybe the feedback for D in DOLLY is a -, meaning that D is in the word but not in position 1. That would mean that D is in another position. So the secret word has D in position 4, for example. So the word would be _ O L D Y. But that would be ""D O L D Y"", which is not a valid word. Alternatively, ""D O L L Y"" is DOLLY, but that has D in position 1. 

This is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the secret word is not DOLLY, but another word that includes O, L, Y, and D, with L in position 3 and another L in position 4, but D not in position 1. 

Wait, but that's impossible because DOLLY is the only 5-letter word with those letters. Therefore, maybe the feedback is different. Perhaps the feedback for D in DOLLY is a -, which means that D is not in the word. But that contradicts the previous feedback where D was in the word. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""DOLLY"", and the feedback for D is a - because the D is in the word but not in position 1. But that's not possible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the feedback. 

Alternatively, perhaps the secret word is ""DOLLY"", and the feedback for D is a -, which means that D is in the word but in a different position. So, for example, D is in position 4. But that would make the word D O L D Y, which is not a valid word. 

This is very confusing. Let me try to think of other possibilities. 

From the feedback, we know that the secret word has O in position 2, L in position 3, Y in position 5. Also, D is in the word but not in position 1. And there's another L in the word but not in position 4. 

So the secret word must have O, L, Y, D, and another L. That's five letters. So the word is D O L L Y. But that's DOLLY. But the feedback for D is -, which would mean that D is not in position 1. But in DOLLY, D is in position 1. Therefore, this is a contradiction. 

This suggests that there's an error in the feedback, but that's unlikely. Therefore, perhaps I need to re-examine the previous steps. 

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""DOLL Y"", but that's two words. Alternatively, ""DOLLY"" is correct, and the feedback for D is a - because D is in the word but not in position 1. That would mean that the secret word has D in position 4. But then the word would be _ O L D Y. So the first letter is something else. Let's say the first letter is not D, but another letter. But the secret word must have O in position 2, L in position 3, Y in position 5, D in position 4. So the word would be _ O L D Y. The first letter could be something else, but it must be a valid 5-letter word. 

For example, ""D O L D Y"" is not valid. ""M O L D Y"" is ""MOLDY"", which is a valid word. Let's check: MOLDY. Letters are M, O, L, D, Y. None of the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E, B, U, S, H) are in MOLDY. So that's possible. 

So the secret word could be MOLDY. Let's check the feedback for DOLLY. If the secret word is MOLDY, then the guess DOLLY would have D in position 1, which is not in the secret word. But the feedback for D is -, which would mean that D is in the word but not in position 1. But in MOLDY, D is in position 4. So the feedback for D in DOLLY would be -, which is correct. 

Wait, but in the guess DOLLY, the D is in position 1. If the secret word is MOLDY, then D is in position 4. So the D in position 1 of the guess is not in the secret word, so the feedback for D should be x. But the feedback says D(-), which means that D is in the word but in the wrong position. But in MOLDY, D is in position 4, so the D in position 1 of the guess is not in the correct position, so it should be -, which is correct. 

Ah, that makes sense. So the secret word is MOLDY. So the feedback for DOLLY is D(-) because D is in the word (position 4) but not in position 1. O is in position 2 (correct), L is in position 3 (correct), the fourth L is in the guess but not in the secret word (since the secret word has D in position 4), so the fourth L is -, and Y is in position 5 (correct). 

So the secret word is MOLDY. 

Therefore, the next step is to guess a word that includes O in position 2, L in position 3, Y in position 5, and D in position 4. So the word is MOLDY. 

But I need to check if that's the case. Let's proceed to the next guess. Since the secret word is MOLDY, the next guess could be MOLDY. But I need to make sure that it's a valid word. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""MOLDY"". So the fourth guess would be MOLDY. Let's try that. 

But I have to make sure that the letters are allowed. M, O, L, D, Y. None of the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E, B, U, S, H) are in MOLDY. So that's valid. 

Therefore, the fourth guess is MOLDY. Let's check the feedback. If that's the secret word, the feedback would be all ✓ for each letter. 

But since I don't know the secret word, I have to proceed with the information I have. 

So based on the previous feedback, the secret word has O in position 2, L in position 3, Y in position 5, and D in position 4. So the word is MOLDY. 

Therefore, my next guess is MOLDY.
</think>

<guess>MOLDY</guess>",MOLDY,"Okay, let's break down the feedback step by step. 

First, the secret word is a 5-letter word. The first guess was CRANE, and all letters were x, meaning none of C, R, A, N, E are in the word. Then, the second guess was BLUSH, which gave feedback: B(x), L(-), U(x), S(x), H(x). So B is out, U, S, H are out, but L is present but in the wrong position. 

Third guess was DOLLY, and the feedback was D(-), O(✓), L(✓), L(-), Y(✓). So D is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's a -), O is correct and in the right position (✓), L is correct but in the wrong position (since the second L is a -), and Y is correct and in the right position (✓). Wait, let me check that again. The feedback for DOLLY is D(-), O(✓), L(✓), L(-), Y(✓). 

So, D is in the word but not in position 1 (since it's a -). O is in the correct position (position 2). L is in the word but not in position 3 (since the third letter is L with a -). Wait, the third letter of DOLLY is L, and the feedback is L(✓) for the third position? Wait, no, the feedback for DOLLY is D(-) O(✓) L(✓) L(-) Y(✓). Wait, that can't be right. Let me parse it again. 

The guess was DOLLY, which is D (1), O (2), L (3), L (4), Y (5). The feedback is D(-), O(✓), L(✓), L(-), Y(✓). So:

- D is in the word but in the wrong position (so D is present but not in position 1).
- O is correct and in the right position (position 2 is O, which is correct).
- L is correct but in the wrong position (position 3 is L, but the feedback is L(✓), which might mean that L is in the word but not in position 3? Wait, the feedback symbols are for each letter in the guess. So for the third letter (L), the feedback is L(✓), meaning that the letter L is in the word and in the correct position. But that contradicts the previous feedback from BLUSH where L was in the word but in the wrong position. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, the feedback for the third guess DOLLY is D(-), O(✓), L(✓), L(-), Y(✓). So:

- D is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's a -).
- O is in the correct position (position 2 is O, so it's correct).
- L is in the correct position (position 3 is L, so it's correct? But that would mean that L is in the correct position. But earlier, from BLUSH, we had L in the word but in the wrong position (position 2). Wait, but BLUSH was the second guess, where the feedback was L(-), meaning that L is in the word but in the wrong position. So if in the third guess, DOLLY, the third letter is L with a ✓, that would mean that L is in the correct position. But that's conflicting with the previous feedback where L was in the wrong position. Wait, that can't be. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the feedback. Let me recheck.

Wait, the feedback for the third guess DOLLY is D(-) O(✓) L(✓) L(-) Y(✓). So:

- D is in the word but in the wrong position (so D is present but not in position 1).
- O is correct and in the right position (position 2 is O, so that's correct).
- L is correct and in the right position (position 3 is L, so that's correct).
- The fourth letter is L with a -, meaning that L is in the word but in the wrong position (so the fourth L is not correct, but the third L is correct? Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe the feedback is that for each letter in the guess, if it's in the correct position, it's ✓, if in the word but wrong position, it's -, and if not in the word, it's x. So for DOLLY:

- D is in the word but not in position 1 (so D is present but in another position).
- O is in the correct position (position 2).
- L is in the correct position (position 3).
- The fourth letter is L, but the feedback is -, meaning that the L in position 4 is in the word but in the wrong position. Wait, but if the third position is L with ✓, that would mean that L is in the correct position. But if the fourth L is -, that would mean that the fourth L is in the word but in the wrong position. That's possible if there are two Ls in the word, but one is in position 3 (correct) and the other is in position 4 (wrong). But that would mean that the secret word has two Ls, one in position 3 and another in position 4. But that's conflicting with the previous feedback where L was in the word but in the wrong position (from BLUSH, where L was in position 2, but the feedback was L(-), meaning that L is in the word but not in position 2. So if the secret word has L in position 3, that's correct, and if there's another L in position 4, that would be wrong. But that's possible. 

But this is getting complicated. Let me try to extract the information:

From the third guess DOLLY, the feedback is:

- D is present but not in position 1.
- O is correct and in position 2.
- L is correct and in position 3.
- The fourth L is present but not in position 4.
- Y is correct and in position 5.

Wait, but that would mean that the secret word has O in position 2, L in position 3, Y in position 5. Also, D is present but not in position 1. And there's another L in the word, but not in position 4. So the secret word has O, L, Y, and D, and another L. But that would make the word have two Ls. Let me think: the secret word is 5 letters. So far, we have O in position 2, L in position 3, Y in position 5. Also, D is present but not in position 1. And another L is present but not in position 4. So possible letters are O, L, Y, D, and another L. So the secret word would be D O L L Y? But that's DOLLY, which was the guess. But the feedback for DOLLY was D(-), O(✓), L(✓), L(-), Y(✓). Wait, that would mean that the secret word is DOLLY, but the feedback for the third guess is D(-) which implies D is in the word but not in position 1. But in DOLLY, D is in position 1. So that's conflicting. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my interpretation. 

Wait, maybe the feedback for DOLLY is D(-), O(✓), L(✓), L(-), Y(✓). So:

- D is in the word but not in position 1 (so D is present but in another position).
- O is correct and in position 2.
- L is correct and in position 3.
- The fourth L is in the word but not in position 4 (so the fourth L is in another position, but the third L is correct).
- Y is correct and in position 5.

So the secret word must have O in position 2, L in position 3, Y in position 5. Also, D is present but not in position 1. And another L is present but not in position 4. So the secret word could be D O L L Y, but the D is in position 1, which contradicts the feedback for D being in the wrong position. Therefore, this suggests that the secret word is not DOLLY, but another word that includes O, L, Y, D, and another L. But that's not possible because DOLLY is the only 5-letter word with those letters. 

This is confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in the feedback interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the secret word is ""DOLLY"", and the feedback for D is a - because D is in the word but not in position 1. But in DOLLY, D is in position 1. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, maybe the feedback is different. 

Alternatively, maybe the feedback for DOLLY is D(-) meaning that D is in the word but not in position 1, which would mean that D is in another position. But if the secret word is DOLLY, then D is in position 1. So that's conflicting. Therefore, perhaps the secret word is not DOLLY, but another word that has O, L, Y, and D, but with the L in a different position. 

Wait, let me think again. From the previous feedback:

- From BLUSH: L is in the word but not in position 2.
- From DOLLY: O is in position 2 (correct), L is in position 3 (correct), Y is in position 5 (correct). Also, D is in the word but not in position 1. 

So the secret word must have O in position 2, L in position 3, Y in position 5. Also, D is present but not in position 1. And there's another L in the word, but not in position 4. 

So the secret word is something like D _ L _ Y. But the second letter is O. So the word is D O L _ Y. The fourth letter is L? But that would make it D O L L Y, which is DOLLY. But the feedback for D in DOLLY is -, which would mean that D is not in position 1. But in DOLLY, D is in position 1. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. 

This suggests that maybe the feedback for DOLLY is incorrect, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the feedback. Let me re-express the feedback for DOLLY:

Guess 3: DOLLY -> FEEDBACK: D(-) O(✓) L(✓) L(-) Y(✓)

So each letter in DOLLY is evaluated:

- D (position 1): - → D is in the word but not in position 1.
- O (position 2): ✓ → O is in the word and in the correct position.
- L (position 3): ✓ → L is in the word and in the correct position.
- L (position 4): - → L is in the word but not in position 4.
- Y (position 5): ✓ → Y is in the word and in the correct position.

So the secret word must have O in position 2, L in position 3, Y in position 5. Also, D is in the word but not in position 1. And there's another L in the word, but not in position 4. 

So the secret word has O, L, Y, D, and another L. But that would make it D O L L Y (DOLLY), but D is in position 1, which contradicts the feedback for D being in the wrong position. Therefore, this suggests that the secret word is not DOLLY. But how?

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""DOLLY"", and the feedback for D is a - because D is in the word but not in position 1. But in DOLLY, D is in position 1. So this is impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in my reasoning. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word has D in position 4, not 1. So the word would be _ O L _ Y, with D in position 4. So the word could be ""D O L D Y""? But that's not a valid word. Or ""D O L L Y"" is DOLLY, but that would have D in position 1. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""DOLL Y"", but that's two words. 

This is confusing. Maybe I need to adjust my approach. Let's list what we know so far:

- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, N, E, B, U, S, H.
- Letters that are in the word: O (position 2), L (position 3), Y (position 5), D (not in position 1), and another L (not in position 4).

So the secret word has O, L, Y, D, and another L. But that's 5 letters. So the word would be D O L L Y (DOLLY), but the feedback for D being in position 1 is conflicting. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my interpretation. 

Wait, maybe the feedback for D in DOLLY is a -, meaning that D is in the word but not in position 1. That would mean that D is in another position. So the secret word has D in position 4, for example. So the word would be _ O L D Y. But that would be ""D O L D Y"", which is not a valid word. Alternatively, ""D O L L Y"" is DOLLY, but that has D in position 1. 

This is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the secret word is not DOLLY, but another word that includes O, L, Y, and D, with L in position 3 and another L in position 4, but D not in position 1. 

Wait, but that's impossible because DOLLY is the only 5-letter word with those letters. Therefore, maybe the feedback is different. Perhaps the feedback for D in DOLLY is a -, which means that D is not in the word. But that contradicts the previous feedback where D was in the word. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""DOLLY"", and the feedback for D is a - because the D is in the word but not in position 1. But that's not possible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the feedback. 

Alternatively, perhaps the secret word is ""DOLLY"", and the feedback for D is a -, which means that D is in the word but in a different position. So, for example, D is in position 4. But that would make the word D O L D Y, which is not a valid word. 

This is very confusing. Let me try to think of other possibilities. 

From the feedback, we know that the secret word has O in position 2, L in position 3, Y in position 5. Also, D is in the word but not in position 1. And there's another L in the word but not in position 4. 

So the secret word must have O, L, Y, D, and another L. That's five letters. So the word is D O L L Y. But that's DOLLY. But the feedback for D is -, which would mean that D is not in position 1. But in DOLLY, D is in position 1. Therefore, this is a contradiction. 

This suggests that there's an error in the feedback, but that's unlikely. Therefore, perhaps I need to re-examine the previous steps. 

Wait, maybe the secret word is ""DOLL Y"", but that's two words. Alternatively, ""DOLLY"" is correct, and the feedback for D is a - because D is in the word but not in position 1. That would mean that the secret word has D in position 4. But then the word would be _ O L D Y. So the first letter is something else. Let's say the first letter is not D, but another letter. But the secret word must have O in position 2, L in position 3, Y in position 5, D in position 4. So the word would be _ O L D Y. The first letter could be something else, but it must be a valid 5-letter word. 

For example, ""D O L D Y"" is not valid. ""M O L D Y"" is ""MOLDY"", which is a valid word. Let's check: MOLDY. Letters are M, O, L, D, Y. None of the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E, B, U, S, H) are in MOLDY. So that's possible. 

So the secret word could be MOLDY. Let's check the feedback for DOLLY. If the secret word is MOLDY, then the guess DOLLY would have D in position 1, which is not in the secret word. But the feedback for D is -, which would mean that D is in the word but not in position 1. But in MOLDY, D is in position 4. So the feedback for D in DOLLY would be -, which is correct. 

Wait, but in the guess DOLLY, the D is in position 1. If the secret word is MOLDY, then D is in position 4. So the D in position 1 of the guess is not in the secret word, so the feedback for D should be x. But the feedback says D(-), which means that D is in the word but in the wrong position. But in MOLDY, D is in position 4, so the D in position 1 of the guess is not in the correct position, so it should be -, which is correct. 

Ah, that makes sense. So the secret word is MOLDY. So the feedback for DOLLY is D(-) because D is in the word (position 4) but not in position 1. O is in position 2 (correct), L is in position 3 (correct), the fourth L is in the guess but not in the secret word (since the secret word has D in position 4), so the fourth L is -, and Y is in position 5 (correct). 

So the secret word is MOLDY. 

Therefore, the next step is to guess a word that includes O in position 2, L in position 3, Y in position 5, and D in position 4. So the word is MOLDY. 

But I need to check if that's the case. Let's proceed to the next guess. Since the secret word is MOLDY, the next guess could be MOLDY. But I need to make sure that it's a valid word. 

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""MOLDY"". So the fourth guess would be MOLDY. Let's try that. 

But I have to make sure that the letters are allowed. M, O, L, D, Y. None of the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E, B, U, S, H) are in MOLDY. So that's valid. 

Therefore, the fourth guess is MOLDY. Let's check the feedback. If that's the secret word, the feedback would be all ✓ for each letter. 

But since I don't know the secret word, I have to proceed with the information I have. 

So based on the previous feedback, the secret word has O in position 2, L in position 3, Y in position 5, and D in position 4. So the word is MOLDY. 

Therefore, my next guess is MOLDY.",Guess 4: MOLDY -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) O(✓) L(✓) D(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
