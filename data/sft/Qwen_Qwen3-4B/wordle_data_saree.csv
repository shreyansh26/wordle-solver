Okay, let's see. I need to guess a 5-letter word. The secret word is somewhere in the list of possible 5-letter English words. Since I don't have any feedback yet, my first guess should be a common or versatile word that might have letters that could be part of many words. Maybe something like ""CRANE"" because it's a common word and has a mix of letters that might be useful. Alternatively, ""STARS"" is another common word. Wait, but maybe ""CRANE"" is better because it has a C, R, A, N, E. Let me think. Alternatively, ""BRAVE"" is a good one because it has B, R, A, V, E. But I'm not sure. Maybe ""CRANE"" is more likely to have letters that could be in the secret word. Let me go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess. If that's not right, I can adjust based on feedback. But since I don't have any feedback yet, I just need to pick a word that's common and has a good chance of overlapping with the secret word. Alternatively, ""STARS"" might be better. Hmm.

Okay, let's see. The first guess was CRANE, and the feedback was C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(✓). So, that means the letters C, A, N are not in the word, but R is present but in the wrong position, and E is correct and in the right position. Wait, no—the feedback symbols are for each letter. Let me parse that again.

The secret word is 5 letters. The feedback for CRANE is:

C(x): So C is not in the word.

R(-): R is in the word but in the wrong position.

A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position.

N(x): N is not in the word.

E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position.

So, from this, we know that E is in the fifth position. Also, R is in the word but not in the second position (since the guess was CRANE, which has R in the second position, but feedback says R is in the wrong position). So R must be in a different position. Similarly, A is in the word but not in the third position (since in CRANE, A is third, but feedback says A is in the wrong position). So A is in the word but not third.

So the secret word has E in the fifth position. Also, R is present but not in position 2. A is present but not in position 3. Also, C, N are not in the word.

So possible letters we know for sure: E is in position 5. R is in the word, but not in position 2. A is in the word, but not in position 3. Also, C and N are excluded.

So let's think about possible letters. The secret word has E in fifth position. So the word is _ _ _ _ E.

We know R is in the word, but not in position 2. So R could be in positions 1, 3, or 4. Also, A is in the word but not in position 3. So A could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5. But position 5 is E, so A can't be there. So A is in 1, 2, or 4.

So possible letters: R and A are in the word, along with other letters. Let's think of possible words that fit.

Let me think of words that end with E. For example, ""RARES"" but that has two R's. Wait, but the secret word has R once? Or could it have multiple letters? The feedback for CRANE only tells us that R is in the word once (since in the guess, R was present once, and feedback says R is in the word but wrong position). So the secret word has R once. Similarly, A is present once (since in the guess, A was present once, and feedback says A is in the word but wrong position). So the secret word has A once and R once, plus E once. So total three letters so far. The other two letters are unknown, but they can't be C or N.

So possible letters: Let's think of words that end with E, have R and A in them, but not in the positions we know. Let's try to think of words.

For example, ""RASES"" but that has two S's. Not sure. Alternatively, ""RASED"" but that's 5 letters. Wait, RASED is R-A-S-E-D. But that's 5 letters. But the fifth letter is D, not E. So that's not. Wait, the fifth letter must be E. So words like ""RARES"" (R-A-R-E-S) but that has two R's. But the secret word might have one R. Alternatively, ""RAISE"" (R-A-I-S-E). That's a valid word. Let's check: R is in position 1, A in position 2, I in 3, S in 4, E in 5. But according to the feedback, A is in the word but not in position 3. In RAISE, A is in position 2, which is allowed. R is in position 1, which is not position 2, so that's okay. So RAISE could be a possibility. But let's check if that fits the feedback.

Alternatively, ""RASPE"" is not a word. ""RASES"" is a word (plural of rase, which is a verb meaning to erase). But that's R-A-S-E-S. But the fifth letter is S, not E. So that's not. So maybe RAISE is a candidate. But let's think of other possibilities.

Another possibility: ""RABAT"" but that ends with T. Not E. ""RABID"" ends with D. ""RABAT"" is not. How about ""RABAT"" is a place, but not sure. Alternatively, ""RABES"" is a word (plural of rabe, which is a type of fish). But that ends with S. Not E. So maybe RAISE is the best fit.

Alternatively, ""RASED"" is R-A-S-E-D. But again, fifth letter is D. Not E. So that's not. So maybe RAISE is the word. But let's think of other possibilities. What about ""RASES""? No, ends with S. ""RASED"" is 5 letters but ends with D. So not. How about ""RAISE"" as the secret word. Let's check the feedback.

If the secret word is RAISE, then the first guess was CRANE. Let's see:

C(x): C is not in the word. Correct.

R(-): R is in the word (position 1), but in the guess, R is in position 2. So in the secret word, R is in position 1, which is different from the guess's position 2. So feedback would be R(-), which matches.

A(-): In the guess, A is in position 3. In the secret word, A is in position 2. So A is present but in the wrong position. So feedback A(-), which matches.

N(x): N is not in the word. Correct.

E(✓): E is in position 5, which matches the guess's position 5. Correct.

So RAISE would fit the feedback. But is there another possible word?

Another possibility: ""RASPE"" is not a valid word. ""RASED"" is not. ""RASES"" is not. How about ""RASED""? No. What about ""RASES""? No. ""RASED"" is not. ""RASED"" is a word? Maybe not. Alternatively, ""RASES"" is a word. But again, fifth letter is S. So not.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""RASED"" but that's not ending with E. Wait, no. So maybe RAISE is the correct word. But let's think of another possibility. What about ""RABAT""? No, ends with T. ""RABES"" ends with S. ""RABAT"" is a place but not sure. ""RABID"" ends with D. So maybe RAISE is the correct word. But I need to check if there are other possibilities.

Alternatively, the secret word could be ""RASPE"" but that's not a valid word. Or ""RASPS"" ends with S. So not. So perhaps RAISE is the correct word. But I need to make sure that there's no other word that fits. Alternatively, maybe ""RASER"" (a person who rases?), but that's not a standard word. Or ""RASER"" is not a valid word. So maybe RAISE is the correct word.

But since I have to make a guess, perhaps I should try a word that fits the known letters. Since the fifth letter is E, and the word has R and A. Let's think of other words. How about ""RAISE"" is the best fit. So my next guess could be ""RAISE"". But let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, RAISE is a valid 5-letter word. So I'll go with that. But wait, the feedback for the first guess was CRANE, and the secret word is RAISE. Then, if I guess RAISE, the feedback would be all correct letters in the right positions. But since I don't know the secret word, I need to make a guess based on the feedback.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""RASER"" but that's not a standard word. So maybe RAISE is the best guess. So my next guess would be RAISE. But I need to make sure that the letters are correct. Let me think again. The secret word has E in position 5, R in the word (not in position 2), A in the word (not in position 3). So possible words could be RAISE, RASSE (but that's not a word), RASES (not ending with E). So RAISE is the best option. So I'll go with RAISE as the next guess.

Okay, let's see. I need to guess a 5-letter word. The secret word is somewhere in the list of possible 5-letter English words. Since I don't have any feedback yet, my first guess should be a common or versatile word that might have letters that could be part of many words. Maybe something like ""CRANE"" because it's a common word and has a mix of letters that might be useful. Alternatively, ""STARS"" is another common word. Wait, but maybe ""CRANE"" is better because it has a C, R, A, N, E. Let me think. Alternatively, ""BRAVE"" is a good one because it has B, R, A, V, E. But I'm not sure. Maybe ""CRANE"" is more likely to have letters that could be in the secret word. Let me go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess. If that's not right, I can adjust based on feedback. But since I don't have any feedback yet, I just need to pick a word that's common and has a good chance of overlapping with the secret word. Alternatively, ""STARS"" might be better. Hmm. Maybe ""CRANE"" is better. Let me go with that.

So R must be in a different position. Similarly, A is in the word but not in the third position (since in CRANE, A is third, but feedback says A is in the wrong position). So A is in the word but not third.

So the secret word has E in the fifth position. Also, R is present but not in position 2. A is present but not in position 3. Also, C, N are not in the word.

So possible letters we know for sure: E is in position 5. R is in the word, but not in position 2. A is in the word, but not in position 3. Also, C and N are excluded.

So let's think about possible letters. The secret word has E in fifth position. So the word is _ _ _ _ E.

We know R is in the word, but not in position 2. So R could be in positions 1, 3, or 4. Also, A is in the word but not in position 3. So A could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5. But position 5 is E, so A can't be there. So A is in 1, 2, or 4.

So possible letters: R and A are in the word, along with other letters. Let's think of possible words that fit.

Let me think of words that end with E. For example, ""RARES"" but that has two R's. Wait, but the secret word has R once? Or could it have multiple letters? The feedback for CRANE only tells us that R is in the word once (since in the guess, R was present once, and feedback says R is in the word but wrong position). So the secret word has R once. Similarly, A is present once (since in the guess, A was present once, and feedback says A is in the word but wrong position). So the secret word has A once and R once, plus E once. So total three letters so far. The other two letters are unknown, but they can't be C or N.

So possible letters: Let's think of words that end with E, have R and A in them, but not in the positions we know. Let's try to think of words.

For example, ""RASES"" but that has two S's. Not sure. Alternatively, ""RASED"" but that's 5 letters. Wait, RASED is R-A-S-E-D. But that's 5 letters. But the fifth letter is D, not E. So that's not. Wait, the fifth letter must be E. So words like ""RARES"" (R-A-R-E-S) but that has two R's. But the secret word might have one R. Alternatively, ""RAISE"" (R-A-I-S-E). That's a valid word. Let's check: R is in position 1, A in position 2, I in 3, S in 4, E in 5. But according to the feedback, A is in the word but not in position 3. In RAISE, A is in position 2, which is allowed. R is in position 1, which is not position 2, so that's okay. So RAISE could be a possibility. But let's check if that fits the feedback.

Alternatively, ""RASPE"" is not a word. ""RASES"" is a word (plural of rase, which is a verb meaning to erase). But that's R-A-S-E-S. But the fifth letter is S, not E. So that's not. So maybe RAISE is a candidate. But let's think of other possibilities.

Another possibility: ""RABAT"" but that ends with T. Not E. ""RABID"" ends with D. ""RABAT"" is not. How about ""RABAT"" is a place, but not sure. Alternatively, ""RABES"" is a word (plural of rabe, which is a type of fish). But that ends with S. Not E. So maybe RAISE is the best fit.

Alternatively, ""RASED"" is R-A-S-E-D. But again, fifth letter is D. Not E. So that's not. So maybe RAISE is the word. But let's think of other possibilities. What about ""RASES""? No, ends with S. ""RASED"" is 5 letters but ends with D. So not. How about ""RAISE"" as the secret word. Let's check the feedback.

If the secret word is RAISE, then the first guess was CRANE. Let's see:

C(x): C is not in the word. Correct.

R(-): R is in the word (position 1), but in the guess, R is in position 2. So in the secret word, R is in position 1, which is different from the guess's position 2. So feedback would be R(-), which matches.

A(-): In the guess, A is in position 3. In the secret word, A is in position 2. So A is present but in the wrong position. So feedback A(-), which matches.

N(x): N is not in the word. Correct.

E(✓): E is in position 5, which matches the guess's position 5. Correct.

So RAISE would fit the feedback. But is there another possible word?

Another possibility: ""RASPE"" is not a valid word. ""RASED"" is not. ""RASES"" is not. How about ""RASED""? No. What about ""RASES""? No. ""RASED"" is not. ""RASED"" is a word? Maybe not. Alternatively, ""RASES"" is a word. But again, fifth letter is S. So not.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""RASED"" but that's not ending with E. Wait, no. So maybe RAISE is the correct word. But let's think of another possibility. What about ""RABAT""? No, ends with T. ""RABES"" ends with S. ""RABAT"" is a place but not sure. ""RABID"" ends with D. So maybe RAISE is the correct word. But I need to check if there are other possibilities.

Alternatively, the secret word could be ""RASPE"" but that's not a valid word. Or ""RASPS"" ends with S. So not. So perhaps RAISE is the correct word. But I need to make sure that there's no other word that fits. Alternatively, maybe ""RASER"" (a person who rases?), but that's not a standard word. Or ""RASER"" is not a valid word. So maybe RAISE is the correct word.

But since I have to make a guess, perhaps I should try a word that fits the known letters. Since the fifth letter is E, and the word has R and A. Let's think of other words. How about ""RAISE"" is the best fit. So my next guess could be ""RAISE"". But let me check if that's a valid word. Yes, RAISE is a valid 5-letter word. So I'll go with that. But wait, the feedback for the first guess was CRANE, and the secret word is RAISE. Then, if I guess RAISE, the feedback would be all correct letters in the right positions. But since I don't know the secret word, I need to make a guess based on the feedback.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""RASER"" but that's not a standard word. So maybe RAISE is the best guess. So my next guess would be RAISE. But I need to make sure that the letters are correct. Let me think again. The secret word has E in position 5, R in the word (not in position 2), A in the word (not in position 3). So possible words could be RAISE, RASSE (but that's not a word), RASES (not ending with E). So RAISE is the best option. So I'll go with RAISE as the next guess.

Okay, let's see. The user has given feedback for two guesses. The first guess was CRANE, which gave feedback C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(✓). Then the second guess was RAISE, which gave R(-), A(✓), I(x), S(-), E(✓). Now I need to figure out the secret word based on this.

First, let's parse the feedback from the first guess again. The secret word has E in the fifth position (since E(✓) in the first guess). Also, R is present but not in the second position (since R(-) in the first guess). A is present but not in the third position (since A(-) in the first guess). C and N are not in the word.

Then, the second guess was RAISE. The feedback for that was R(-), A(✓), I(x), S(-), E(✓). So, R is in the word but not in the first position (since in RAISE, R is in the first position, but the feedback says R(-), meaning it's in the word but wrong position. Wait, but in the first guess, R was in the second position, and the feedback said R(-), meaning it's in the word but wrong position. So in the second guess, R is in the first position, which is different from the first guess's position. So that's okay. But the feedback for R in the second guess is (-), which means R is in the word but in the wrong position. Wait, but in the first guess, R was in position 2, and the feedback was R(-), meaning it's in the word but wrong position. So that's consistent. Now, in the second guess, R is in position 1, but the feedback is R(-), which means that R is in the word but not in position 1. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, no. The feedback for the second guess is R(-), which means that the letter R is in the word but in the wrong position. So in the second guess, R is in position 1, but the secret word's R is not in position 1. Therefore, the secret word's R must be in a different position, like position 3 or 4.

But in the first guess, R was in position 2, and the feedback was R(-), meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. So now, in the second guess, R is in position 1, and the feedback is R(-), meaning R is in the word but not in position 1. Therefore, the secret word's R must be in position 3 or 4.

Also, in the second guess, A is in position 2, and the feedback is A(✓), meaning A is in the word and in the correct position. Wait, but in the first guess, A was in position 3, and the feedback was A(-), meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. Now, in the second guess, A is in position 2, and the feedback is A(✓), so A is in position 2. Therefore, the secret word has A in position 2. That's a key point.

So from the second guess, we know that A is in position 2. Also, E is in position 5. So the word is _ A _ _ E.

Also, R is in the word but not in position 1 (from second guess feedback) or position 2 (from first guess feedback). So R must be in position 3 or 4.

Additionally, the feedback for the second guess says I(x) and S(-). So I is not in the word, and S is in the word but in the wrong position. Wait, S(-) means S is in the word but in the wrong position. So S is present in the word but not in position 4 (since in the second guess, S is in position 4). Therefore, S is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word has A in position 2, E in position 5, R in position 3 or 4, and S is present but not in position 4. Also, the letters C and N are excluded.

So possible letters: Let's think of words that fit _ A _ _ E, with R in position 3 or 4, and S in the word but not in position 4.

Possible words:

If R is in position 3: _ A R _ E. Then, the first position could be something else, and the fourth position could be S or another letter. But S is in the word but not in position 4. So maybe S is in position 1 or 3. Wait, position 3 is R, so S can't be there. So S could be in position 1 or 3? No, position 3 is R. So S could be in position 1 or 3? Wait, position 3 is R. So S must be in position 1 or 3? No, position 3 is R. So S could be in position 1 or 3? Wait, no. If the word is _ A R _ E, then the fourth position is something else. So S could be in position 1 or 3? But position 3 is R. So S can't be there. Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 3? No, position 3 is R. So S must be in position 1 or 3? No, position 3 is R. Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 3? No, position 3 is R. Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 3? No, that's not possible. Wait, maybe S is in position 1. So the word would be S A R _ E. Then, the fourth position is something else. But the fourth position can't be S because the feedback says S is in the word but not in position 4. So that's okay.

Alternatively, if R is in position 4: _ A _ R E. Then, S could be in position 1, 2, or 3. But position 2 is A, so S can't be there. So S could be in position 1 or 3.

So possible words:

If R is in position 3: S A R _ E. The fourth position could be something else. Let's think of words. For example, ""SARSE""? Not sure. ""SARSE"" is a word? Maybe not. Or ""SARAE""? That's a name, but not sure if it's a valid English word. Alternatively, ""SARAE"" is a plural of ""sar"", which is a type of fabric. Not sure. Alternatively, ""SARAE"" might not be valid.

If R is in position 4: _ A _ R E. Let's think of words. For example, ""SARAE"" again. Or ""BARES"" but that's B A R E S. But that ends with S, not E. Wait, the fifth letter is E, so ""BARES"" is B A R E S, which ends with S. Not E. So that's not. How about ""BARED""? No, ends with D. ""BARES"" is not. ""BARES"" is not correct. How about ""SAREE""? S A R E E. But that's 5 letters. Wait, SAREE is S-A-R-E-E. But the fifth letter is E, which is correct. But the secret word would be SAREE. Let's check if that fits the feedback.

But the feedback from the second guess (RAISE) had S(-), meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. In SAREE, S is in position 1, so that's okay. Also, R is in position 3, which is not position 1 (from the second guess's R(-) feedback). So that would fit.

Alternatively, ""SAREE"" is a valid word. So that's possible.

Another possibility: ""SARSE"" is not a valid word. ""SARSE"" is a misspelling of ""sarsen"". But not sure. ""SARSE"" might not be valid.

Alternatively, ""RASEE""? Not sure. ""RASEE"" is not a standard word.

Another option: ""SARAE"" as mentioned before. But I'm not sure if that's a valid word. Alternatively, ""SAREE"" is a valid word. So maybe the secret word is SAREE. Let's check the feedback.

If the secret word is SAREE, then:

First guess: CRANE. Feedback C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(✓). Correct because SAREE has E in position 5, R is in position 3 (so in the first guess, R is in position 2, so feedback R(-) is correct. A is in position 2 (in SAREE, A is in position 2, but in the first guess, A is in position 3, so feedback A(-) is correct. C and N are not present. So that's correct.

Second guess: RAISE. The secret word is SAREE. So RAISE is R A I S E. Comparing to SAREE:

R is in position 1 of the guess, but in the secret word, R is in position 3. So feedback R(-) is correct. A is in position 2 of the guess, which matches the secret word's A in position 2, so feedback A(✓). I is in position 3 of the guess, but in the secret word, position 3 is R, so I is not present. So I(x). S is in position 4 of the guess, but in the secret word, S is in position 1. So S(-) is correct. E is in position 5, so E(✓). That matches the feedback for the second guess.

So SAREE would fit. But is SAREE a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it's a type of fabric. So that's possible.

Alternatively, another word could be ""SAREE"". So the next guess would be SAREE. But let's check if there are other possibilities.

Another possibility: ""RASEE"" is not a valid word. ""RASED"" is not. ""RASES"" is not. ""RASEE"" is not. So ""SAREE"" seems like the best fit.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""SARAE"". But that's a name, not sure if it's valid. But ""SAREE"" is more likely.

So the next guess would be SAREE. Let's check if that's a valid word. Yes, SAREE is a valid 5-letter word. So I'll go with that.

<guess>SAREE</guess>",SAREE,"Okay, let's see. The user has given feedback for two guesses. The first guess was CRANE, which gave feedback C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(✓). Then the second guess was RAISE, which gave R(-), A(✓), I(x), S(-), E(✓). Now I need to figure out the secret word based on this.

Now, in the second guess, R is in position 1, but the feedback is R(-), which means that R is in the word but not in position 1. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, no. The feedback for the second guess is R(-), which means that the letter R is in the word but in the wrong position. So in the second guess, R is in position 1, but the secret word's R is not in position 1. Therefore, the secret word's R must be in a different position, like position 3 or 4.

So now, in the second guess, R is in position 1, and the feedback is R(-), meaning R is in the word but not in position 1. Therefore, the secret word's R must be in position 3 or 4.

Also, in the second guess, A is in position 2, and the feedback is A(✓), meaning A is in the word and in the correct position. Wait, but in the first guess, A was in position 3, and the feedback was A(-), meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. Now, in the second guess, A is in position 2, and the feedback is A(✓), so A is in position 2. Therefore, the secret word has A in position 2. That's a key point.

So from the second guess, we know that A is in position 2. Also, E is in position 5. So the word is _ A _ _ E.

Also, R is in the word but not in position 1 (from second guess feedback) or position 2 (from first guess feedback). So R must be in position 3 or 4.

Additionally, the feedback for the second guess says I(x) and S(-). So I is not in the word, and S is in the word but in the wrong position. Wait, S(-) means S is in the word but in the wrong position. So S is present in the word but not in position 4 (since in the second guess, S is in position 4). Therefore, S is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word has A in position 2, E in position 5, R in position 3 or 4, and S is present but not in position 4. Also, the letters C and N are excluded.

So possible letters: Let's think of words that fit _ A _ _ E, with R in position 3 or 4, and S in the word but not in position 4.

Possible words:

If R is in position 3: _ A R _ E. Then, the first position could be something else, and the fourth position could be S or another letter. But S is in the word but not in position 4. So maybe S is in position 1 or 3. Wait, position 3 is R, so S can't be there. So S could be in position 1 or 3? No, position 3 is R. So S could be in position 1 or 3? Wait, position 3 is R. So S must be in position 1 or 3? No, position 3 is R. So S could be in position 1 or 3? Wait, no. If the word is _ A R _ E, then the fourth position is something else. So S could be in position 1 or 3? But position 3 is R. So S can't be there. Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 3? No, position 3 is R. So S must be in position 1 or 3? No, position 3 is R. Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 3? No, position 3 is R. Therefore, S must be in position 1 or 3? No, that's not possible. Wait, maybe S is in position 1. So the word would be S A R _ E. Then, the fourth position is something else. But the fourth position can't be S because the feedback says S is in the word but not in position 4. So that's okay.

Alternatively, if R is in position 4: _ A _ R E. Then, S could be in position 1, 2, or 3. But position 2 is A, so S can't be there. So S could be in position 1 or 3.

So possible words:

If R is in position 3: S A R _ E. The fourth position could be something else. Let's think of words. For example, ""SARSE""? Not sure. ""SARSE"" is a word? Maybe not. Or ""SARAE""? That's a name, but not sure if it's a valid English word. Alternatively, ""SARAE"" is a plural of ""sar"", which is a type of fabric. Not sure. Alternatively, ""SARAE"" might not be valid.

If R is in position 4: _ A _ R E. Let's think of words. For example, ""SARAE"" again. Or ""BARES"" but that's B A R E S. But that ends with S, not E. Wait, the fifth letter is E, so ""BARES"" is B A R E S, which ends with S. Not E. So that's not. How about ""BARED""? No, ends with D. ""BARES"" is not. ""BARES"" is not correct. How about ""SAREE""? S A R E E. But that's 5 letters. Wait, SAREE is S-A-R-E-E. But the fifth letter is E, which is correct. But the secret word would be SAREE. Let's check if that fits the feedback.

But the feedback from the second guess (RAISE) had S(-), meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. In SAREE, S is in position 1, so that's okay. Also, R is in position 3, which is not position 1 (from the second guess's R(-) feedback). So that would fit.

Alternatively, ""SAREE"" is a valid word. So that's possible.

Another possibility: ""SARSE"" is not a valid word. ""SARSE"" is a misspelling of ""sarsen"". But not sure. ""SARSE"" might not be valid.

Alternatively, ""RASEE""? Not sure. ""RASEE"" is not a standard word.

Another option: ""SARAE"" as mentioned before. But I'm not sure if that's a valid word. Alternatively, ""SAREE"" is a valid word. So maybe the secret word is SAREE. Let's check the feedback.

If the secret word is SAREE, then:

First guess: CRANE. Feedback C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(✓). Correct because SAREE has E in position 5, R is in position 3 (so in the first guess, R is in position 2, so feedback R(-) is correct. A is in position 2 (in SAREE, A is in position 2, but in the first guess, A is in position 3, so feedback A(-) is correct. C and N are not present. So that's correct.

Second guess: RAISE. The secret word is SAREE. So RAISE is R A I S E. Comparing to SAREE:

R is in position 1 of the guess, but in the secret word, R is in position 3. So feedback R(-) is correct. A is in position 2 of the guess, which matches the secret word's A in position 2, so feedback A(✓). I is in position 3 of the guess, but in the secret word, position 3 is R, so I is not present. So I(x). S is in position 4 of the guess, but in the secret word, S is in position 1. So S(-) is correct. E is in position 5, so E(✓). That matches the feedback for the second guess.

So SAREE would fit. But is SAREE a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it's a type of fabric. So that's possible.

Alternatively, another word could be ""SAREE"". So the next guess would be SAREE. But let's check if there are other possibilities.

Another possibility: ""RASEE"" is not a valid word. ""RASED"" is not. ""RASES"" is not. ""RASEE"" is not. So ""SAREE"" seems like the best fit.

Alternatively, maybe the secret word is ""SARAE"". But that's a name, not sure if it's valid. But ""SAREE"" is more likely.

So the next guess would be SAREE. Let's check if that's a valid word. Yes, SAREE is a valid 5-letter word. So I'll go with that.",Guess 3: SAREE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) R(✓) E(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
