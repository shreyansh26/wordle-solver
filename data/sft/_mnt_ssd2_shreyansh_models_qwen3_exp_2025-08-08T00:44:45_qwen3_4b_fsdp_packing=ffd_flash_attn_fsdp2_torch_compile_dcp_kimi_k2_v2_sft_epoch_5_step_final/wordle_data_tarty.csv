For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - five very common letters. This gives us maximum information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" - both are strong starting words. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's particularly effective at revealing common vowels and consonants.

Let me choose AROSE as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R somewhere, but NOT in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.
- Has 5 distinct letters (since we’ve eliminated duplicates for now).

Good next letters to try are common consonants that haven’t been ruled out yet: T, L, N, C, D, M, P, etc.  
I’ll try a word that places A and R in new positions and adds fresh, common consonants.  
A strong candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T, I, N are new letters.
- A moves to position 3.
- R moves to position 2 (still not its original spot).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - five very common letters. This gives us maximum information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" - both are strong starting words. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's particularly effective at revealing common vowels and consonants.

Let me choose AROSE as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R somewhere, but NOT in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.
- Has 5 distinct letters (since we’ve eliminated duplicates for now).

Good next letters to try are common consonants that haven’t been ruled out yet: T, L, N, C, D, M, P, etc.  
I’ll try a word that places A and R in new positions and adds fresh, common consonants.  
A strong candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T, I, N are new letters.
- A moves to position 3.
- R moves to position 2 (still not its original spot).

From Guess 4 (TURDY) we now know:

- T(✓) – confirmed in position 1.
- R(✓) – confirmed in position 3.
- Y(✓) – confirmed in position 5.

So the pattern so far is: T _ R _ Y

Letters we still need to place:
- A (must be in the word, but not in positions 1 or 3; the only remaining positions are 2 or 4)
- The remaining letter must be a consonant not yet ruled out (from earlier exclusions: O, S, E, I, N, M, P, U, D).

Available positions for A: 2 or 4.

Let’s consider possible letters for the remaining spot (position 2 or 4) that haven’t been used or ruled out.

Common consonants not yet used: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, V, W.

If we place A in position 2, the word would be T A R _ Y, and the blank must be one of the remaining consonants. Possible words:
- TARCY (C is okay)
- TARFY (F is okay)
- TARGY (G is okay)

If we place A in position 4, the word would be T _ R A Y, and the blank must be one of the remaining consonants. Possible words:
- T B R A Y (not a valid English word)
- T C R A Y (not valid)
- T F R A Y (not valid)
- T G R A Y (not valid)
- T H R A Y (not valid)
- T L R A Y (not valid)
- T V R A Y (not valid)
- T W R A Y (not valid)

None of these seem valid, so placing A in position 4 is unlikely to yield a word. Let’s try placing A in position 2.

Possible words:
- TARCY – “TARCY” is not a common English word.
- TARFY – not common.
- TARGY – not common.

Wait, let me think of valid English words that fit T _ R _ Y with A in position 2.

Actually, “TARRY” comes to mind, but that has R twice, and we already have R in position 3. Also, “TARRY” would have A in position 2 and Y in position 5, but R is already in position 3, so T A R R Y – but this repeats R, and we don’t know if R appears twice.

Another possibility: “TARCY” – not valid.
“TARFY” – not valid.
“TARLY” – but L is allowed, and this is actually a valid word (TARLY – though rare).

But let’s think of more common words. “TARRY” is the only common word that fits T _ R _ Y with A in position 2, but it repeats R.

Wait, maybe the word is “TARRY” despite the double R. Let me check if this is possible.

But we only have one R confirmed in position 3. If the word has two R’s, we need to see if that’s allowed. The feedback didn’t indicate any restriction on duplicate letters, so it’s possible.

However, “TARRY” is a valid English word meaning to move back and forth.

But let me think of another possibility: “TARCY” is not valid, “TARFY” is not valid.

Another approach: the word must be T _ R _ Y with A in position 2 or 4.

If A is in position 2: T A R _ Y – the blank must be a consonant not yet ruled out. The only common consonant that makes a valid word is C, giving T A R C Y – but “TARCY” is not a word.

Wait, “TARRY” is the only valid word here.

But let me double-check: the word must be T _ R _ Y, and A must be in the word. The only way is T A R _ Y, and the blank must be a consonant. The only valid word is T A R R Y.

But this seems odd. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the word is “TARRY” despite the double R. Let me check if this is acceptable.

Yes, “TARRY” is a valid 5-letter English word.

But let me see if there’s another possibility. For example, “TARLY” is a valid word (though rare), but “TARRY” is more common.

Given the constraints, “TARRY” seems to be the best candidate.

But let me verify: T(✓) R(✓) Y(✓) are in their correct positions. A must be in the word, and the only remaining position is 2 or 4. If A is in position 2, then the word is T A R _ Y, and the blank must be a consonant. The only valid word is T A R R Y.

Thus, the word must be “TARRY”.

But wait, let me check if “TARRY” fits all constraints:

- T in position 1: ✓
- R in position 3: ✓
- Y in position 5: ✓
- A must be in the word: yes, A is in position 2.
- No excluded letters: O, S, E, I, N, M, P, U, D are not used.
- All letters are valid.

Therefore, the only possible word is “TARRY”.

But let me think again: is there another word? For example, “TARCY” is not valid, “TARFY” is not valid, “TARLY” is valid but less common.

Given that, “TARRY” is the most likely.

But wait, let me think of another possibility: “TARCY” is not valid, but “TARCY” is not a word.

Another check: “TARRY” is indeed the only valid word fitting T _ R _ Y with A in position 2.

Thus, the next guess should be “TARRY”.

But let me verify once more:

- T(1) ✓
- _ (2) must be A to satisfy A in the word
- R(3) ✓
- _ (4) must be R to make T A R R Y
- Y(5) ✓

Yes, this seems correct.

But let me think if there’s another word: “TARCY” is not valid, “TARLY” is valid but less common.

Given the constraints, “TARRY” is the only valid word.

However, let me consider if the word could be “TARRY” or another word.

But according to the constraints, “TARRY” is the only possible word.

Therefore, the next guess should be “TARRY”.

But wait, let me think again: the word must be T _ R _ Y with A in position 2 or 4.

If A is in position 4: T _ R A Y – the blank must be a consonant not yet ruled out. Possible consonants: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, V, W.

Looking for valid English words:

- T B R A Y – not valid
- T C R A Y – not valid
- T F R A Y – not valid
- T G R A Y – not valid
- T H R A Y – not valid
- T L R A Y – not valid
- T V R A Y – not valid
- T W R A Y – not valid

None of these are valid English words, so A must be in position 2.

Thus, the word must be T A R _ Y with the blank being a consonant not ruled out. The only valid word is T A R R Y.

Therefore, the next guess is “TARRY”.

But let me check if “TARRY” is acceptable: yes, it’s a valid English word.

Thus, the next guess is “TARRY”.

However, I realize that “TARRY” is actually a valid word meaning to move back and forth, and it fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is “TARRY”.

But wait, let me think again: the word must be T _ R _ Y with A in the word. The only valid word is “TARRY”.

Thus, the next guess is “TARRY”.

But let me verify once more: positions 1,3,5 are T,R,Y. A must be in position 2 or 4. The only valid word is “TARRY”.

Therefore, the next guess is “TARRY”.

But I realize that this seems like the only possible word, so I’ll go with it.

From the feedback:

- T(✓) is fixed in position 1.
- R(✓) is fixed in position 3.
- Y(✓) is fixed in position 5.
- A must appear somewhere in the word (since it was marked ""-"" in earlier guesses), and the only remaining positions are 2 or 4.

The only valid 5-letter English word that fits the pattern T _ R _ Y and contains A is:

<guess>TARRY</guess>",TARRY,"From Guess 4 (TURDY) we now know:

- T(✓) – confirmed in position 1.
- R(✓) – confirmed in position 3.
- Y(✓) – confirmed in position 5.

So the pattern so far is: T _ R _ Y

Letters we still need to place:
- A (must be in the word, but not in positions 1 or 3; the only remaining positions are 2 or 4)
- The remaining letter must be a consonant not yet ruled out (from earlier exclusions: O, S, E, I, N, M, P, U, D).

Available positions for A: 2 or 4.

Let’s consider possible letters for the remaining spot (position 2 or 4) that haven’t been used or ruled out.

Common consonants not yet used: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, V, W.

If we place A in position 2, the word would be T A R _ Y, and the blank must be one of the remaining consonants. Possible words:
- TARCY (C is okay)
- TARFY (F is okay)
- TARGY (G is okay)

If we place A in position 4, the word would be T _ R A Y, and the blank must be one of the remaining consonants. Possible words:
- T B R A Y (not a valid English word)
- T C R A Y (not valid)
- T F R A Y (not valid)
- T G R A Y (not valid)
- T H R A Y (not valid)
- T L R A Y (not valid)
- T V R A Y (not valid)
- T W R A Y (not valid)

None of these seem valid, so placing A in position 4 is unlikely to yield a word. Let’s try placing A in position 2.

Possible words:
- TARCY – “TARCY” is not a common English word.
- TARFY – not common.
- TARGY – not common.

Wait, let me think of valid English words that fit T _ R _ Y with A in position 2.

Actually, “TARRY” comes to mind, but that has R twice, and we already have R in position 3. Also, “TARRY” would have A in position 2 and Y in position 5, but R is already in position 3, so T A R R Y – but this repeats R, and we don’t know if R appears twice.

Another possibility: “TARCY” – not valid.
“TARFY” – not valid.
“TARLY” – but L is allowed, and this is actually a valid word (TARLY – though rare).

But let’s think of more common words. “TARRY” is the only common word that fits T _ R _ Y with A in position 2, but it repeats R.

Wait, maybe the word is “TARRY” despite the double R. Let me check if this is possible.

But we only have one R confirmed in position 3. If the word has two R’s, we need to see if that’s allowed. The feedback didn’t indicate any restriction on duplicate letters, so it’s possible.

However, “TARRY” is a valid English word meaning to move back and forth.

But let me think of another possibility: “TARCY” is not valid, “TARFY” is not valid.

Another approach: the word must be T _ R _ Y with A in position 2 or 4.

If A is in position 2: T A R _ Y – the blank must be a consonant not yet ruled out. The only common consonant that makes a valid word is C, giving T A R C Y – but “TARCY” is not a word.

Wait, “TARRY” is the only valid word here.

But let me double-check: the word must be T _ R _ Y, and A must be in the word. The only way is T A R _ Y, and the blank must be a consonant. The only valid word is T A R R Y.

But this seems odd. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the word is “TARRY” despite the double R. Let me check if this is acceptable.

Yes, “TARRY” is a valid 5-letter English word.

But let me see if there’s another possibility. For example, “TARLY” is a valid word (though rare), but “TARRY” is more common.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - five very common letters. This gives us maximum information about the presence of these letters in the secret word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" - both are strong starting words. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's particularly effective at revealing common vowels and consonants.

Let me choose AROSE as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second).
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R somewhere, but NOT in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.
- Has 5 distinct letters (since we’ve eliminated duplicates for now).

Good next letters to try are common consonants that haven’t been ruled out yet: T, L, N, C, D, M, P, etc.  
I’ll try a word that places A and R in new positions and adds fresh, common consonants.  
A strong candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T, I, N are new letters.
- A moves to position 3.
- R moves to position 2 (still not its original spot).

Current constraints:

1. Letters known to be in the word:
   - A (but not in positions 1 or 3)
   - R (but not in positions 2 or 4)
   - T (and it is in the correct position: position 1)

2. Letters known NOT to be in the word:
   - O, S, E, I, N

3. Positions we know:
   - Position 1 = T (✓)

4. Remaining letters to consider (common ones not yet ruled out):
   - B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

5. We still need to place A and R in the remaining positions (2, 3, 4, 5) while avoiding their previously excluded spots:
   - A cannot be in 1 or 3
   - R cannot be in 2 or 4

6. We need a new letter that hasn’t been tested yet to gather more information.

A good next word would:
- Keep T in position 1
- Move A and R to new allowed positions
- Introduce a fresh common consonant

Candidate words:
- TURB? (but B is less common)
- TRAMP (but M and P are good, A and R in new spots)
- TRULY (but U and Y are okay)
- TURBO (but O is ruled out)
- TRAMP seems strong: T(✓), R(allowed in 2), A(allowed in 3), M(new), P(new)

Let’s go with TRAMP.

From all feedback so far:

1. Letters known to be in the word:

   - A (somewhere, but not positions 1 or 3)
   - R (somewhere, but not positions 2 or 4)

2. Letters known NOT to be in the word:
   - O, S, E, I, N, M, P

3. Positions we know:
   - Position 1 = T

4. Remaining letters to consider (common ones not yet ruled out):
   - B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, U, V, W, Y

5. We still need to place A and R in the remaining positions (2, 3, 4, 5) while avoiding their previously excluded spots:
   - A cannot be in 1 or 3
   - R cannot be in 2 or 4

6. We need a word that:
   - Keeps T in position 1
   - Uses A and R in new allowed positions
   - Introduces at least one new common letter from the remaining pool

Possible placements:
- A can be in 2, 4, or 5
- R can be in 3 or 5

Let’s try a word that places A in position 2 and R in position 3, and introduces a new letter like L or D.

Candidate words:
- TARDY (but D and Y are okay, A in 2, R in 3)
- TARLY (but L is okay)
- TARDO (but O is ruled out)
- TARBY (but B is okay)

TARDY seems good: T(✓), A(2), R(3), D(new), Y(new)

However, we should avoid repeating letters we haven’t ruled out. Let me double-check:
- T, A, R, D, Y: none are in the excluded list.

But wait, we already know A is in the word and R is in the word, so we don’t need to test them again in this guess. We just need to place them correctly.

Another candidate: TRULY
- T(✓), R(2) - but R cannot be in position 2 (from feedback on TRAIN)
So TRULY is invalid.

Next candidate: TURDY
- T(✓), U(new), R(3), D(new), Y(new)
This places R in position 3 (allowed) and introduces U, D, Y.

This seems valid.

Let me choose TURDY.

From Guess 4 (TURDY) we now know:

- T(✓) – confirmed in position 1.
- R(✓) – confirmed in position 3.
- Y(✓) – confirmed in position 5.

So the pattern so far is: T _ R _ Y

Letters we still need to place:
- A (must be in the word, but not in positions 1 or 3; the only remaining positions are 2 or 4)
- The remaining letter must be a consonant not yet ruled out (from earlier exclusions: O, S, E, I, N, M, P, U, D).

Available positions for A: 2 or 4.

Let’s consider possible letters for the remaining spot (position 2 or 4) that haven’t been used or ruled out.

Common consonants not yet used: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, V, W.

If we place A in position 2, the word would be T A R _ Y, and the blank must be one of the remaining consonants. Possible words:
- TARCY (C is okay)
- TARFY (F is okay)
- TARGY (G is okay)

If we place A in position 4, the word would be T _ R A Y, and the blank must be one of the remaining consonants. Possible words:
- T B R A Y (not a valid English word)
- T C R A Y (not valid)
- T F R A Y (not valid)
- T G R A Y (not valid)
- T H R A Y (not valid)
- T L R A Y (not valid)
- T V R A Y (not valid)
- T W R A Y (not valid)

None of these seem valid, so placing A in position 4 is unlikely to yield a word. Let’s try placing A in position 2.

Possible words:
- TARCY – “TARCY” is not a common English word.
- TARFY – not common.
- TARGY – not common.

Wait, let me think of valid English words that fit T _ R _ Y with A in position 2.

Actually, “TARRY” comes to mind, but that has R twice, and we already have R in position 3. Also, “TARRY” would have A in position 2 and Y in position 5, but R is already in position 3, so T A R R Y – but this repeats R, and we don’t know if R appears twice.

Another possibility: “TARCY” – not valid.
“TARFY” – not valid.
“TARLY” – but L is allowed, and this is actually a valid word (TARLY – though rare).

But let’s think of more common words. “TARRY” is the only common word that fits T _ R _ Y with A in position 2, but it repeats R.

Wait, maybe the word is “TARRY” despite the double R. Let me check if this is possible.

But we only have one R confirmed in position 3. If the word has two R’s, we need to see if that’s allowed. The feedback didn’t indicate any restriction on duplicate letters, so it’s possible.

Given that, “TARRY” is the most likely.

But wait, let me think of another possibility: “TARCY” is not valid, but “TARCY” is not a word.

Another check: “TARRY” is indeed the only valid word fitting T _ R _ Y with A in position 2.

Thus, the next guess should be “TARRY”.

But let me verify once more:

- T(1) ✓
- _ (2) must be A to satisfy A in the word
- R(3) ✓

- Y(5) ✓

Yes, this seems correct.

A must be in the word, and the only remaining position is 2 or 4. If A is in position 2, then the word is T A R _ Y, and the blank must be a consonant.

From Guess 5 (TARRY) we now know:

- T(✓) – position 1 is correct.
- A(✓) – position 2 is correct.
- R(✓) – position 3 is correct.
- R(-) – the second R is in the word but in the wrong position (it cannot be position 4).
- Y(✓) – position 5 is correct.

So the pattern is now: T A R _ Y, and the fourth letter must be a consonant that is NOT R (since the second R is already confirmed to exist but is not in position 4).

Letters already used or ruled out:
- R is already used in positions 3 and possibly 4, but position 4 is wrong for R.
- Other ruled-out letters: O, S, E, I, N, M, P, U, D.

Remaining consonants not yet tried: B, C, F, G, H, K, L, V, W.

We need a single consonant in position 4 that forms a valid 5-letter English word with the pattern T A R _ Y.

Valid English words fitting T A R _ Y:
- T A R B Y – “TARB” is not a common word, but “TARB” is not valid.
- T A R C Y – “TARCY” is not a valid word.
- T A R F Y – “TARFY” is not valid.
- T A R G Y – “TARGY” is not valid.
- T A R H Y – “TARHY” is not valid.
- T A R K Y – “TARKY” is not valid.
- T A R L Y – “TARLY” is valid (though rare, it is listed in some dictionaries as a variant of “tarly” meaning a type of bird).
- T A R V Y – “TARVY” is not valid.
- T A R W Y – “TARWY” is not valid.

The only valid English word here is “TARLY”.

Therefore, the next and likely final guess is “TARLY”.
