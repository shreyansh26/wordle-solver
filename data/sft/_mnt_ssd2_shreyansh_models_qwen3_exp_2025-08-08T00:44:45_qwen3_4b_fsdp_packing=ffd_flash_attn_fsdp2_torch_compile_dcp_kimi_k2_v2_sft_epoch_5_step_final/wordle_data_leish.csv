For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Looking at the most common letters in English, I see that vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N are very common. 

A good first guess would be a word that uses a mix of these common letters. The word ""AROSE"" is a strong candidate because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It contains 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English
- It has no repeating letters, maximizing information gain

This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- S is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not the 5th).
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Ends with S
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1-4
- Does NOT contain A, R, O

Common consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out)

A good second guess should:
1. Keep the last letter as S
2. Move E to a new position (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
3. Introduce new common consonants

Let's try ""UNITS"":
- Ends with S (matches requirement)
- Moves E to the 5th position (but we know E is not in 5th from feedback, so this is bad)
Wait, that's not good - E can't be in 5th.

Let's try ""INSET"":
- Ends with S
- E is in 3rd position (new position)
- Introduces I, N, T (common consonants)
- Doesn't use A, R, O

This seems better.

From the feedback so far:

Letters in the word (with positions):
- S is in position 5 (✓ from arose)
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from arose, inset, bused)

So E must be in position 1.

Remaining common consonants to try: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: E (fixed in position 1), U (already out), so no other vowels except E.

Pattern so far: E _ _ _ S

We need three more consonants in positions 2, 3, 4, using only the allowed set above.

Good candidates:

Wait, but we have no info that E can't repeat. However, we have only one E confirmed so far, but the word could have more.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Looking at the most common letters in English, I see that vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N are very common. 

A good first guess would be a word that uses a mix of these common letters. The word ""AROSE"" is a strong candidate because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It contains 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English
- It has no repeating letters, maximizing information gain

This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- S is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not the 5th).
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Ends with S
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1-4
- Does NOT contain A, R, O

Common consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out)

A good second guess should:
1. Keep the last letter as S
2. Move E to a new position (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
3. Introduce new common consonants

Let's try ""UNITS"":
- Ends with S (matches requirement)
- Moves E to the 5th position (but we know E is not in 5th from feedback, so this is bad)
Wait, that's not good - E can't be in 5th.

Let's try ""INSET"":
- Ends with S
- E is in 3rd position (new position)
- Introduces I, N, T (common consonants)
- Doesn't use A, R, O

This seems better.

Let's consolidate what we know so far:

Letters in the word:
- S (must be in position 5)
- E (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 2, 3, or 4)

Letters NOT in the word:
A, R, O, N, T, I

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ _ S
with E somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Remaining common consonants to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: E (already confirmed), U (since A, O are out).

Good candidates should:
1. Keep S in position 5
2. Place E in position 1, 2, or 3
3. Use new consonants

Let's try ""BUSED"":
- Ends with S
- E in position 3 (new position)
- Uses B, U, D (all new letters)
- Doesn't reuse any eliminated letters

This seems like a strong next guess.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after four guesses.

Letters in the word (with positions):
- S must be in position 5 (from arose).
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (because elves showed E is not in 1, 2, 4, and arose/inset/bused already ruled out 2,3,5).

Wait, that’s impossible: a 5-letter word cannot have E in none of the positions if elves showed E is not in 1,2,4, and arose/inset/bused already ruled out 2,3,5. The only remaining spot for E is position 3.

So the word must be: _ _ E _ S

Letters NOT in the word (from all feedback):
A, R, O, N, T, I, B, U, D, V

Remaining consonants to try: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, W, Y

We need two consonants for positions 1 and 2 (and one for position 4, but position 4 is already blank).

Let’s list valid 5-letter words matching _ _ E _ S with remaining letters:

- CHESS – C, H allowed, but S already in position 5, so double S is fine.
- FLESH – F, L allowed, but H is allowed.
- GLEAM – A is out.
- PEEPS – P, E, S, but P is allowed, but double E is fine.
- WEEPS – W, E, P, S – but E is already in position 3, so E in position 1 is not allowed (from elves feedback).
- CHEES – C, H allowed, E in position 3, S in 5 – but double E is fine.

CHESS and FLESH are valid. CHESS uses C and H, which are allowed. FLESH uses F and L, which are allowed.

Between them, CHESS seems more likely because C and H are very common.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Looking at the most common letters in English, I see that vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N are very common. 

A good first guess would be a word that uses a mix of these common letters. The word ""AROSE"" is a strong candidate because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- It contains 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequent in English
- It has no repeating letters, maximizing information gain

This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- S is in the word and in the correct (last) position.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not the 5th).
- A, R, O are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Ends with S
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1-4
- Does NOT contain A, R, O

Common consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out)

A good second guess should:
1. Keep the last letter as S
2. Move E to a new position (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
3. Introduce new common consonants

Let's try ""UNITS"":
- Ends with S (matches requirement)
- Moves E to the 5th position (but we know E is not in 5th from feedback, so this is bad)
Wait, that's not good - E can't be in 5th.

Let's try ""INSET"":
- Ends with S
- E is in 3rd position (new position)
- Introduces I, N, T (common consonants)
- Doesn't use A, R, O

This seems better.

Guess 2: inset -> FEEDBACK: I(-) N(x) S(-) E(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's consolidate what we know so far:

Letters in the word:
- S (must be in position 5)
- E (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 2, 3, or 4)

Letters NOT in the word:
A, R, O, N, T, I

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ _ S
with E somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Remaining common consonants to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: E (already confirmed), U (since A, O are out).

Good candidates should:
1. Keep S in position 5
2. Place E in position 1, 2, or 3
3. Use new consonants

Let's try ""BUSED"":
- Ends with S
- E in position 3 (new position)
- Uses B, U, D (all new letters)
- Doesn't reuse any eliminated letters

This seems like a strong next guess.

From the feedback so far:

Letters in the word (with positions):
- S is in position 5 (✓ from arose)
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from arose, inset, bused)

So E must be in position 1.

Letters NOT in the word:
A, R, O, N, T, I, B, U, D

Remaining common consonants to try: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: E (fixed in position 1), U (already out), so no other vowels except E.

Pattern so far: E _ _ _ S

We need three more consonants in positions 2, 3, 4, using only the allowed set above.

Good candidates:
- E + common consonants
- Try to cover new letters quickly

Possible words:
- ECHOS (but O is out)
- EELSS (invalid, repeats S)
- EFTSY (but Y is uncommon)
- EFGHS (not a word)
- ELVES (but V is allowed, L and V are allowed, E is in position 1, S in 5)
  - Check: E L V E S - but E is already in position 1, so position 4 would be E, which is allowed (E is in the word, but we don't know if it can repeat). However, we have no info against it.

Wait, but we have no info that E can't repeat. However, we have only one E confirmed so far, but the word could have more.

But let's look for valid words:
- EELSS - invalid
- EFTSY - invalid
- EFGHS - invalid
- EELDS - D is out
- EELBS - B is out
- EELNS - N is out
- EELTS - T is out
- EELIS - I is out
- EELAR - A is out
- EELOR - O is out
- EELUR - U is out
- EELER - R is out
- EELER - E is allowed, but R is out
- EELER - invalid
- EELER - invalid

Hmm, let's try a different approach. We have E in position 1 and S in position 5. Need three consonants in positions 2,3,4 from allowed set {C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y}.

Possible valid words:
- ECHOS - O is out
- EFTSY - not a word
- EFGHS - not a word
- EELDS - D is out
- EELBS - B is out
- EELNS - N is out
- EELTS - T is out
- EELIS - I is out
- EELAR - A is out
- EELOR - O is out
- EELUR - U is out
- EELER - R is out
- EELER - invalid
- EELER - invalid

Wait, maybe ""E"" is in position 1 and we need three consonants. Let's list possible combinations:

E _ _ _ S

Possible consonants: C, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y

Try ""E"" + ""L"" + ""V"" + ""E"" + ""S"" → ""ELVES"" - but E is already in position 1, and we don't know if it can appear again. However, ""ELVES"" is a valid word and uses allowed letters.

Check letters:
E (position 1) - allowed
L - allowed
V - allowed
E (position 4) - allowed (no info against it)
S (position 5) - required

No conflicts with previous feedback.

Another candidate: ""E"" + ""L"" + ""P"" + ""S"" + ""S"" - invalid (double S)
""E"" + ""C"" + ""H"" + ""S"" + ""S"" - invalid
""E"" + ""F"" + ""T"" + ""S"" + ""S"" - invalid
""E"" + ""C"" + ""K"" + ""S"" + ""S"" - invalid

""ELVES"" seems the best valid word.Based on the feedback:
- S is in position 5 (✓)
- E must be in position 1 (only remaining spot for E)
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, N, T, I, B, U, D

The pattern is now: E _ _ _ S

Let’s list every constraint we have so far.

Known positions:
- S is in position 5 (✓ from arose).

Letters that are in the word (but positions still unknown):
- E must appear at least once.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all (from all feedback):
A, R, O, N, T, I, B, U, D, V, C

Letters that have been ruled out of specific positions:
- Position 1: A, R, O, I, B, C
- Position 2: N, T, I, S, L, H
- Position 3: E (from arose/inset/bused/elves/chees, E is not in 1,2,3,4,5? Wait no: elves showed E is not in 1,2,4; arose/inset/bused showed E is not in 2,3,5. So E must be in position 3.

So the word must be: _ _ E _ S

Remaining consonants allowed: F, G, K, M, P, W, Y

We need two consonants for positions 1 and 2, and one for position 4.

Valid 5-letter words matching _ _ E _ S with remaining letters:
- F E E D S – D is out.
- F L E E S – L is allowed, but L is in position 2 (from elves feedback, L is not in position 2). So FLEES is invalid.
- F E E P S – P is allowed, but double E is fine. FEEPS is not a valid word.
- G E E S – too short.
- P E E P S – P is allowed, but double E is fine. PEEPS is valid.
- W E E P S – P is allowed, but double E is fine. WEEPS is valid.
- Y E E S – too short.

PEEPS and WEEPS are the only valid candidates left.

PEEPS: P, E, E, P, S – uses P (allowed), E (must be in position 3), S (position 5). P is allowed in positions 1 and 4.

WEEPS: W, E, E, P, S – same logic.

Between PEEPS and WEEPS, both are valid, but PEEPS uses P twice, which is allowed. Since we have no info against P, and we have only one guess left, we can try PEEPS.

But wait, we have 6 guesses allowed, and we’ve used 5. The next guess (guess 6) must be PEEPS.

However, let me double-check:
- P: allowed (not in eliminated list)
- E: must be in position 3 (confirmed)
- E: second E in position 4 – no restriction against it
- P: position 2 – allowed
- S: position 5 – confirmed

So PEEPS is valid.
