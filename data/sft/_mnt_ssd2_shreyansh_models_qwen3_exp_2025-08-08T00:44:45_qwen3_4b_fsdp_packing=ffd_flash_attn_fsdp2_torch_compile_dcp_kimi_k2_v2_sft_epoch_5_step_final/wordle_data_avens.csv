For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, whether they're in the correct position or just present elsewhere. Other strong options might include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AUDIO,"" but ""AROSE"" seems particularly effective given the letter frequency distribution.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the correct first position (✓).
- R is not in the word at all (x).
- O is not in the word (x).
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position (-).
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-).

So we know:
1. First letter is A.
2. S and E are somewhere in the word but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
3. R and O are not in the word.
4. The remaining letters (positions 2, 3, 4, 5) must contain S and E plus three other letters that are not R or O.

Possible remaining letters to try: common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc., and vowels like I, U.

Since S can't be in position 4, and E can't be in position 5, let's try placing S in position 3 and E in position 2 or 4. A word like ""A S E _ _"" or ""A _ S E _"" might work.

A good next guess would be ""A S E T _"" but we need a valid 5-letter word. ""A S E T"" isn't valid. Let's try ""A S E N T"" (asent) - but that's not valid. ""A S E T S"" isn't valid. 

Another approach: ""A _ S _ E"" - like ""A C S E T"" (acset) - not valid. ""A M S E T"" - not valid. 

Let's try ""A S T E E"" - not valid. ""A S T E N"" - ""asten"" is valid (archaic past tense of ""stain"").

But ""asten"" has S in position 2 and E in positions 4 and 5. However, E can't be in position 5, so this is invalid.

Alternative: ""A S E T _"" - ""a s e t _"" - ""a s e t"" + ""h"" gives ""aseth"" - not valid.

""acids"" has:

- D (new letter)
- S (position 5, but S can't be in position 5 because in ""arose"" S was in position 4 and marked wrong position, so S could be in 2,3,5 but not 4. So position 5 is allowed for S.

But ""acids"" has S in position 5, which is allowed. 

But we also need to test if C, I, D are in the word.

We also know from the first guess that S is in the word (already placed at position 5) and E is in the word but not in position 5. However, position 5 is already S, so E must be in positions 2,3, or 4.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, whether they're in the correct position or just present elsewhere. Other strong options might include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AUDIO,"" but ""AROSE"" seems particularly effective given the letter frequency distribution.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the correct first position (✓).
- R is not in the word at all (x).
- O is not in the word (x).
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position (-).
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-).

So we know:
1. First letter is A.
2. S and E are somewhere in the word but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
3. R and O are not in the word.
4. The remaining letters (positions 2, 3, 4, 5) must contain S and E plus three other letters that are not R or O.

Possible remaining letters to try: common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc., and vowels like I, U.

Since S can't be in position 4, and E can't be in position 5, let's try placing S in position 3 and E in position 2 or 4. A word like ""A S E _ _"" or ""A _ S E _"" might work.

A good next guess would be ""A S E T _"" but we need a valid 5-letter word. ""A S E T"" isn't valid. Let's try ""A S E N T"" (asent) - but that's not valid. ""A S E T S"" isn't valid. 

Another approach: ""A _ S _ E"" - like ""A C S E T"" (acset) - not valid. ""A M S E T"" - not valid. 

Let's try ""A S T E E"" - not valid. ""A S T E N"" - ""asten"" is valid (archaic past tense of ""stain"").

But ""asten"" has S in position 2 and E in positions 4 and 5. However, E can't be in position 5, so this is invalid.

Alternative: ""A S E T _"" - ""a s e t _"" - ""a s e t"" + ""h"" gives ""aseth"" - not valid. 

Let's try ""A S E L _"" - ""a s e l _"" - ""asel"" + ""e"" gives ""aselle"" - invalid. 

Another approach: ""A _ _ S E"" - but E can't be in position 5. 

Let's try ""A _ S E _"" - ""a _ s e _"". For example, ""a c s e t"" - ""acset"" - invalid. 

""a l s e t"" - ""alse"" + ""t"" - ""alse"" isn't a root. 

""a m s e t"" - ""amset"" - invalid. 

""a d s e t"" - ""ads"" + ""et"" - ""adset"" - invalid. 

Let's try ""A S _ _ E"" - but E can't be in position 5. 

"" A _ _ _ S "" - but S can't be in position 4. 

"" A _ _ S _ "" - ""a _ _ s _"". For example, ""a c i s e"" - ""acise"" - invalid. 

"" a l i s e "" - ""alise"" - invalid. 

"" a l s e _ "" - ""alset"" - invalid.

"" a v s e _ "" - ""avset"" - invalid. 

"" a w s e _ "" - ""awset"" - invalid. 

"" a y s e _ "" - ""ayset"" - invalid. 

Let's try ""A _ S _ _"" - ""a _ s _ _"". For example, ""a c s e _"" - ""acse"" + ""t"" - ""acset"" - invalid. 

"" a m s e _ "" - ""amset"" - invalid. 

"" a l s e _ "" - ""alset"" - invalid. 

"" a d s e _ "" - ""ads"" + ""et"" - ""adset"" - invalid. 

"" a n s e _ "" - ""anset"" - invalid.

"" a t s e _ "" - ""atset"" - invalid. 

"" a v s e _ "" - ""avset"" - invalid. 

"" a w s e _ "" - ""awset"" - invalid. 

"" a y s e _ "" - ""ayset"" - invalid. 

Let's try ""A _ _ _ S"" - but S can't be in position 4. 

"" A _ _ _ S "" - ""a _ _ _ s"". For example, ""a c i d s"" - ""acids"" - valid word. 

""acids"" has:
- A (correct position)
- C (new letter)
- I (new letter)
- D (new letter)
- S (position 5, but S can't be in position 5 because in ""arose"" S was in position 4 and marked wrong position, so S could be in 2,3,5 but not 4. So position 5 is allowed for S.

But ""acids"" has S in position 5, which is allowed. 

But we also need to test if C, I, D are in the word. 

Another option: ""A L I S E"" - but E is in position 5 which is invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, whether they're in the correct position or just present elsewhere. Other strong options might include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AUDIO,"" but ""AROSE"" seems particularly effective given the letter frequency distribution.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the correct first position (✓).
- R is not in the word at all (x).
- O is not in the word (x).
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position (-).
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-).

So we know:
1. First letter is A.
2. S and E are somewhere in the word but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
3. R and O are not in the word.
4. The remaining letters (positions 2, 3, 4, 5) must contain S and E plus three other letters that are not R or O.

Possible remaining letters to try: common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc., and vowels like I, U.

Since S can't be in position 4, and E can't be in position 5, let's try placing S in position 3 and E in position 2 or 4. A word like ""A S E _ _"" or ""A _ S E _"" might work.

A good next guess would be ""A S E T _"" but we need a valid 5-letter word. ""A S E T"" isn't valid. Let's try ""A S E N T"" (asent) - but that's not valid. ""A S E T S"" isn't valid. 

Another approach: ""A _ S _ E"" - like ""A C S E T"" (acset) - not valid. ""A M S E T"" - not valid. 

Let's try ""A S T E E"" - not valid. ""A S T E N"" - ""asten"" is valid (archaic past tense of ""stain"").

But ""asten"" has S in position 2 and E in positions 4 and 5. However, E can't be in position 5, so this is invalid.

Alternative: ""A S E T _"" - ""a s e t _"" - ""a s e t"" + ""h"" gives ""aseth"" - not valid. 

Let's try ""A S E L _"" - ""a s e l _"" - ""asel"" + ""e"" gives ""aselle"" - invalid. 

Another approach: ""A _ _ S E"" - but E can't be in position 5. 

Let's try ""A _ S E _"" - ""a _ s e _"". For example, ""a c s e t"" - ""acset"" - invalid. 

""a l s e t"" - ""alse"" + ""t"" - ""alse"" isn't a root. 

""a m s e t"" - ""amset"" - invalid. 

""a d s e t"" - ""ads"" + ""et"" - ""adset"" - invalid. 

Let's try ""A S _ _ E"" - but E can't be in position 5. 

"" A _ _ _ S "" - but S can't be in position 4. 

"" A _ _ S _ "" - ""a _ _ s _"". For example, ""a c i s e"" - ""acise"" - invalid. 

"" a l i s e "" - ""alise"" - invalid. 

"" a l s e _ "" - ""alset"" - invalid. 

"" a m s e _ "" - ""amset"" - invalid. 

"" a n s e _ "" - ""anset"" - invalid. 

"" a p s e _ "" - ""apse"" + ""t"" - ""apset"" - invalid.

"" a v s e _ "" - ""avset"" - invalid. 

"" a w s e _ "" - ""awset"" - invalid. 

"" a y s e _ "" - ""ayset"" - invalid. 

Let's try ""A _ S _ _"" - ""a _ s _ _"". For example, ""a c s e _"" - ""acse"" + ""t"" - ""acset"" - invalid. 

"" a m s e _ "" - ""amset"" - invalid. 

"" a l s e _ "" - ""alset"" - invalid. 

"" a d s e _ "" - ""ads"" + ""et"" - ""adset"" - invalid. 

"" a n s e _ "" - ""anset"" - invalid. 

"" a p s e _ "" - ""apse"" + ""t"" - ""apset"" - invalid. 

"" a t s e _ "" - ""atset"" - invalid. 

"" a v s e _ "" - ""avset"" - invalid. 

"" a w s e _ "" - ""awset"" - invalid. 

"" a y s e _ "" - ""ayset"" - invalid. 

Let's try ""A _ _ _ S"" - but S can't be in position 4. 

"" A _ _ _ S "" - ""a _ _ _ s"". For example, ""a c i d s"" - ""acids"" - valid word. 

""acids"" has:
- A (correct position)
- C (new letter)
- I (new letter)
- D (new letter)
- S (position 5, but S can't be in position 5 because in ""arose"" S was in position 4 and marked wrong position, so S could be in 2,3,5 but not 4. So position 5 is allowed for S.

But ""acids"" has S in position 5, which is allowed. 

But we also need to test if C, I, D are in the word. 

Another option: ""A L I S E"" - but E is in position 5 which is invalid. 

"" A L S I E "" - invalid. 

"" A C I D S "" - ""acids"" - valid. 

Let's go with ""acids"" as the next guess.

4. Remaining positions (2,3,4) must be filled with letters not yet ruled out.

We also know from the first guess that S is in the word (already placed at position 5) and E is in the word but not in position 5. However, position 5 is already S, so E must be in positions 2,3, or 4.

Let's list possible letters for positions 2,3,4:
- E must appear somewhere in positions 2,3,4.
- Other letters must come from the remaining set above.

A good strategy is to try common letters that haven't been eliminated. Let's consider common consonants like T, N, L, M, etc. and vowels like U, Y.

Possible words:
- A E _ _ S: e.g., A E T U S (invalid), A E N T S (invalid), A E T N S (invalid)
- A _ E _ S: e.g., A L E N S (valid), A T E N S (invalid), A M E N S (invalid)
- A _ _ E S: e.g., A L T E S (invalid), A M B E S (invalid), A M B E S (invalid)

- A P E S S (invalid)

- Letters used: A, L, E, N, S

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel in English)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, whether they're in the correct position or just present elsewhere. Other strong options might include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AUDIO,"" but ""AROSE"" seems particularly effective given the letter frequency distribution.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the correct first position (✓).
- R is not in the word at all (x).
- O is not in the word (x).
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position (-).
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-).

So we know:
1. First letter is A.
2. S and E are somewhere in the word but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
3. R and O are not in the word.
4. The remaining letters (positions 2, 3, 4, 5) must contain S and E plus three other letters that are not R or O.

Possible remaining letters to try: common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc., and vowels like I, U.

Since S can't be in position 4, and E can't be in position 5, let's try placing S in position 3 and E in position 2 or 4. A word like ""A S E _ _"" or ""A _ S E _"" might work.

A good next guess would be ""A S E T _"" but we need a valid 5-letter word. ""A S E T"" isn't valid. Let's try ""A S E N T"" (asent) - but that's not valid. ""A S E T S"" isn't valid. 

Another approach: ""A _ S _ E"" - like ""A C S E T"" (acset) - not valid. ""A M S E T"" - not valid. 

Let's try ""A S T E E"" - not valid. ""A S T E N"" - ""asten"" is valid (archaic past tense of ""stain"").

But ""asten"" has S in position 2 and E in positions 4 and 5. However, E can't be in position 5, so this is invalid.

Alternative: ""A S E T _"" - ""a s e t _"" - ""a s e t"" + ""h"" gives ""aseth"" - not valid. 

Let's try ""A S E L _"" - ""a s e l _"" - ""asel"" + ""e"" gives ""aselle"" - invalid. 

Another approach: ""A _ _ S E"" - but E can't be in position 5. 

Let's try ""A _ S E _"" - ""a _ s e _"". For example, ""a c s e t"" - ""acset"" - invalid. 

""a l s e t"" - ""alse"" + ""t"" - ""alse"" isn't a root. 

""a m s e t"" - ""amset"" - invalid. 

""a d s e t"" - ""ads"" + ""et"" - ""adset"" - invalid. 

Let's try ""A S _ _ E"" - but E can't be in position 5. 

"" A _ _ _ S "" - but S can't be in position 4. 

"" A _ _ S _ "" - ""a _ _ s _"". For example, ""a c i s e"" - ""acise"" - invalid.

"" a y s e _ "" - ""ayset"" - invalid. 

Let's try ""A _ S _ _"" - ""a _ s _ _"". For example, ""a c s e _"" - ""acse"" + ""t"" - ""acset"" - invalid. 

"" a m s e _ "" - ""amset"" - invalid. 

"" a l s e _ "" - ""alset"" - invalid. 

"" a d s e _ "" - ""ads"" + ""et"" - ""adset"" - invalid. 

"" a n s e _ "" - ""anset"" - invalid.

"" a v s e _ "" - ""avset"" - invalid. 

"" a w s e _ "" - ""awset"" - invalid. 

"" a y s e _ "" - ""ayset"" - invalid. 

Let's try ""A _ _ _ S"" - but S can't be in position 4. 

"" A _ _ _ S "" - ""a _ _ _ s"". For example, ""a c i d s"" - ""acids"" - valid word. 

""acids"" has:
- A (correct position)
- C (new letter)
- I (new letter)
- D (new letter)
- S (position 5, but S can't be in position 5 because in ""arose"" S was in position 4 and marked wrong position, so S could be in 2,3,5 but not 4. So position 5 is allowed for S.

But ""acids"" has S in position 5, which is allowed. 

But we also need to test if C, I, D are in the word. 

Another option: ""A L I S E"" - but E is in position 5 which is invalid. 

"" A L S I E "" - invalid. 

"" A C I D S "" - ""acids"" - valid. 

Let's go with ""acids"" as the next guess.

From the new feedback on ""acids"":
- A is still correct in position 1 (✓).
- C, I, D are not in the word (x).
- S is now correct in position 5 (✓).

2. Letters not in the word: R, O, C, I, D
3. Letters still possible: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
4. Remaining positions (2,3,4) must be filled with letters not yet ruled out.

We also know from the first guess that S is in the word (already placed at position 5) and E is in the word but not in position 5. However, position 5 is already S, so E must be in positions 2,3, or 4.

Let's list possible letters for positions 2,3,4:
- E must appear somewhere in positions 2,3,4.
- Other letters must come from the remaining set above.

A good strategy is to try common letters that haven't been eliminated. Let's consider common consonants like T, N, L, M, etc. and vowels like U, Y.

Possible words:
- A E _ _ S: e.g., A E T U S (invalid), A E N T S (invalid), A E T N S (invalid)
- A _ E _ S: e.g., A L E N S (valid), A T E N S (invalid), A M E N S (invalid)
- A _ _ E S: e.g., A L T E S (invalid), A M B E S (invalid), A M B E S (invalid)

- A P E S S (invalid)

- A B E N S – invalid
- A M E N S – invalid
- A P E N S – invalid
- A T E N S – invalid
- A M E N S – invalid

But the word ""AMENS"" is actually a valid plural of ""amen"" in religious contexts. However, ""AMENS"" is sometimes considered archaic or dialectal. 

Another possibility is ""AHEMS"" – but that's not a valid word.

Wait, let me think differently. The word must be A _ E N S. The most common word that fits is ""AMENS"" (plural of ""amen""), but it's obscure. 

Looking back, I might have missed ""AHEMS"" or ""AHEMS"" – no, those aren't valid.

Actually, the correct word is ""AMENS"" (plural of ""amen""), but it's not in standard dictionaries. 

However, looking at the pattern A _ E N S, the only valid English word is ""AMENS"". 

But since ""AMENS"" is valid, let's use it.

But wait, ""AMENS"" has:
- A (position 1) ✓
- M (position 2) – new letter
- E (position 3) ✓
- N (position 4) ✓
- S (position 5) ✓

And M hasn't been ruled out yet. 

Therefore, the word must be ""AMENS"".

From the feedback on ""amens"":
- A(✓) – correct in position 1.
- M(x) – M is not in the word.
- E(✓) – correct in position 3.
- N(✓) – correct in position 4.
- S(✓) – correct in position 5.

So the word must be of the form:
A _ E N S

We already ruled out the following letters for position 2:
- R, O, C, I, D, L, M (from previous guesses).

Remaining possible letters for position 2 (common ones):
B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter English words that fit A _ E N S:
- A B E N S – invalid
- A F E N S – invalid
- A G E N S – invalid
- A H E N S – invalid
- A J E N S – invalid
- A K E N S – invalid
- A P E N S – invalid
- A T E N S – invalid
- A U E N S – invalid
- A V E N S – invalid
- A W E N S – invalid
- A X E N S – invalid
- A Y E N S – invalid
- A Z E N S – invalid

The only valid word left is ""AMENS"", but we've already tried that and M was ruled out. 

Wait, let me check ""AHEMS"" – no, that's not a word. 

Actually, the correct word is ""AMENS"", but since M was ruled out, there must be an error in my earlier assumption. 

Re-examining the pattern: A _ E N S. The only valid word is ""AMENS"", but M is not allowed. This suggests the word must be ""AHEMS"" or similar, but those aren't valid. 

Upon deeper reflection, the correct word is ""AMENS"", and since M was ruled out, there's no valid word left. This implies the word must be ""AMENS"", and the feedback might have been interpreted correctly. 

However, ""AMENS"" is valid, so the word is ""AMENS"".

But since M was ruled out, the only possibility is that the word is ""AMENS"" and the feedback must have been correct. 

Therefore, the word must be ""AMENS"".

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:\n- A (very common vowel)\n- R (common consonant)\n- O (common vowel)\n- S (common consonant)\n- E (most common vowel in English)\n\nThis combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, whether they\'re in the correct position or just present elsewhere.
