Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A popular choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can help identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Another excellent option is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, T (common consonants) and A, E (common vowels). However, ""AROSE"" is slightly more balanced with three vowels and two consonants. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides good initial coverage.

A good second guess should test new consonants and the remaining vowel. Let’s try a word with O in a different position and include other common letters. “POINT” is a good candidate:
- P, I, N, T are all new letters.
- O is in position 2 (not 3), satisfying the feedback.
- It avoids A, R, S, E.

Another option is “LUMPY” (but Y is less common), or “MOUTH” (but H is less common). “POINT” is more balanced.

Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A popular choice is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and can help identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Available letters (excluding the ones already eliminated):
- Vowels left: U  
- Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters for positions 3 and 4. Common combinations:
- “PO” + “UND” → “POUND” (but N is eliminated)  
- “PO” + “ULK” → “POULK” (not a valid word)  
- “PO” + “ULKY” → “POULKY” (too long)  
- “PO” + “ULK” → “POULK” (invalid)  
- “PO” + “ULKY” → invalid  
- “PO” + “ULK” → invalid  
- “PO” + “ULKY” → invalid  

Let’s think of valid 5-letter words starting with “PO” that avoid all eliminated letters.  
- “POKED” – uses K, E, D → E is eliminated.  
- “POLL” – only 4 letters.  
- “POKER” – R is eliminated.  
- “PODGY” – G, Y are allowed.  
- “PODGY” → P O D G Y → valid word, letters not eliminated.  
- “PODGY” → positions: P(1) O(2) D(3) G(4) Y(5). All letters are allowed.

Another candidate: “POKEY” (but K, E, Y – E is eliminated).  
“POKED” – E eliminated.  
“PODGY” seems best.

Let’s check:  
- P O D G Y  
- P(✓) O(✓) D – new letter, G – new letter, Y – new letter.  
- All letters not in the eliminated set.

Therefore, “PODGY” is a valid next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O, but not in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

We now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has an O, but O ≠ position 3.
2. Avoids A, R, S, E.

Common consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Vowels left: I, U (since O is already confirmed, and A, E are out).

A good second guess should test new consonants and the remaining vowel. Let’s try a word with O in a different position and include other common letters. “POINT” is a good candidate:
- P, I, N, T are all new letters.
- O is in position 2 (not 3), satisfying the feedback.
- It avoids A, R, S, E.

Another option is “LUMPY” (but Y is less common), or “MOUTH” (but H is less common). “POINT” is more balanced.

Let’s go with POINT.

From the two guesses we have:

   - O is in the word, but not in position 3.

2. POINT → P(✓) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   - P is correct in position 1.  
   - O is correct in position 2.  
   - I, N, T are not in the word.

So the secret word looks like: P O _ _ _

We now need a 5-letter word that starts with “PO” and uses only letters not yet ruled out (i.e., not A, R, S, E, I, N, T).

Available letters (excluding the ones already eliminated):
- Vowels left: U  
- Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters for positions 3 and 4. Common combinations:

<guess>POCKY</guess>",POCKY,"We now know:
- Word pattern: P O _ _ Y (positions 1, 2, 5 are locked)
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, I, N, T, D, G, U, H
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: C (it appeared in position 4 of POUCH and got “-”, so C is in the word but not in position 4)

Remaining letters available (alphabet minus the eliminated ones): B, F, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need two more letters for positions 3 and 4, one of which must be C (since C is confirmed in the word but not in position 4). The only possible positions left for C are 3 or 4, but position 4 was already ruled out for C, so C must be in position 3.

Thus the word must be: P O C _ Y

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits P O C _ Y. The only common word that fits is “POCKY”.

Check letters:
- P, O, C, K, Y – none of these are in the eliminated set.
- C is in position 3, which satisfies the feedback (C was in the word but not in position 4).

Therefore, “POCKY” is the next logical guess.",Guess 5: POCKY -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) C(✓) K(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
