2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering many high-frequency letters and both vowels (A, E) and consonants (S, L, T). This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

All five letters in SLATE were marked with “x”, which means none of S, L, A, T, or E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common words.  
Next, I should pick a word that avoids these five letters and still uses common remaining consonants and vowels.  
Good remaining consonants include R, N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels include I, O, U.

A strong candidate is “ROUND” – it uses R, O, U, N, D, none of which were in SLATE.  
Another candidate is “CRIMP” – but P is less common.  
“ROUND” seems better because R, N, D are very common consonants, and O, U are common vowels.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters eliminated (x): S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D  
- Letters confirmed in the word but in wrong positions (-): O, N  

So the secret word must contain both O and N, but O is not in position 2 and N is not in position 4.  
We also know the remaining letters that are still possible (not yet ruled out) include: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both O and N.
2. Does not contain any of S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 2.
4. Places N somewhere other than position 4.

Let’s brainstorm possible positions for O and N:

- O could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- N could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

A good candidate is “CONIC”:
- Contains C, O, N, I, C.

Candidate: “BONGO”:

Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. Letters eliminated (x):  
   S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D, V

2. Letters confirmed in the word (✓ or -):  
   - I is in the correct position 2.  
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
   - G is in the word but NOT in position 3.

3. Therefore the secret word has the pattern:  
   _ I _ _ _  
   with letters O and N somewhere else, plus G somewhere else.

4. Remaining unused letters (not yet ruled out):  
   B, C, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z, plus O, N, G (already confirmed present).

5. We need to place O, N, G in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but respecting the constraints).

6. Possible positions for O: 1, 3, 5 (cannot be 2 or 4).  
   Possible positions for N: 1, 3, 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).  
   Possible positions for G: 1, 4, 5 (cannot be 3).

7. Let’s try to find a word that fits:  
   - Position 2 = I  
   - Must contain O, N, G in the remaining four positions, each in an allowed spot.

  - I is in position 3, but we know I must be in position 2. Invalid.

- “FOIGN” – F, O, I, G, N.  
  - I is in position 3 – invalid.

- “HOGIN” – H, O, G, I, N.  
  - I is in position 4 – invalid.

- “BINGO” – B, I, N, G, O.  
  - I is in position 2 – OK.  
  - N is in position 3 – allowed.  
  - G is in position 4 – allowed.  
  - O is in position 5 – allowed.  
  - No eliminated letters.  
  - This looks valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering many high-frequency letters and both vowels (A, E) and consonants (S, L, T). This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE were marked with “x”, which means none of S, L, A, T, or E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common words.  
Next, I should pick a word that avoids these five letters and still uses common remaining consonants and vowels.  
Good remaining consonants include R, N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels include I, O, U.

A strong candidate is “ROUND” – it uses R, O, U, N, D, none of which were in SLATE.  
Another candidate is “CRIMP” – but P is less common.  
“ROUND” seems better because R, N, D are very common consonants, and O, U are common vowels.

So I’ll go with ROUND.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

- Letters eliminated (x): S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D  
- Letters confirmed in the word but in wrong positions (-): O, N  

So the secret word must contain both O and N, but O is not in position 2 and N is not in position 4.  
We also know the remaining letters that are still possible (not yet ruled out) include: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both O and N.
2. Does not contain any of S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 2.
4. Places N somewhere other than position 4.

Let’s brainstorm possible positions for O and N:

- O could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- N could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

A good candidate is “CONIC”:
- Contains C, O, N, I, C.
- O is in position 2 (but feedback said O is in the word but not in position 2). So this is invalid.

Next candidate: “NOISE” – but E and S are eliminated.

Candidate: “FOIST” – S is eliminated.

Candidate: “WONKY”:
- W, O, N, K, Y.
- O is in position 2 – invalid.

Candidate: “CHINO”:
- C, H, I, N, O.
- O is in position 5 (allowed), N is in position 4 – but feedback said N is not in position 4. So invalid.

Candidate: “HONKY”:
- H, O, N, K, Y.
- O is in position 2 – invalid.

Candidate: “BONGO”:
- B, O, N, G, O.
- O is in positions 2 and 5 – position 2 is invalid.
- N is in position 3 (allowed).

But the word has two O’s – we don’t know if the secret word has repeated letters. This is risky.

Candidate: “PINKY”:
- P, I, N, K, Y.
- Contains N and I, but no O. Invalid.

Candidate: “VIGON”:
- V, I, G, O, N.
- O is in position 4 (allowed), N is in position 5 (allowed). No eliminated letters. This looks valid.

Let’s check:
- V, I, G, O, N: none are in the eliminated set.
- Contains both O and N.
- O is in position 4 (not 2) – allowed.
- N is in position 5 (not 4) – allowed.

“VIGON” is a valid 5-letter word.

Another candidate: “CHINO” was invalid because N was in position 4. “VIGON” seems best.

   - N is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
   - G is in the word but NOT in position 3.

3. Therefore the secret word has the pattern:

4. Remaining unused letters (not yet ruled out):

6. Possible positions for O: 1, 3, 5 (cannot be 2 or 4).  
   Possible positions for N: 1, 3, 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).  
   Possible positions for G: 1, 4, 5 (cannot be 3).

7. Let’s try to find a word that fits:  
   - Position 2 = I  
   - Must contain O, N, G in the remaining four positions, each in an allowed spot.

Candidate words that fit:

  - I is in position 3, but we know I must be in position 2. Invalid.

- “FOIGN” – F, O, I, G, N.  
  - I is in position 3 – invalid.

- “HOGIN” – H, O, G, I, N.  
  - I is in position 4 – invalid.

- “BINGO” – B, I, N, G, O.  
  - I is in position 2 – OK.  
  - N is in position 3 – allowed.  
  - G is in position 4 – allowed.  
  - O is in position 5 – allowed.  
  - No eliminated letters.  
  - This looks valid.

Let’s verify:  
B I N G O  
- I in position 2 ✓  
- N in position 3 (not 5) ✓  
- G in position 4 (not 3) ✓  
- O in position 5 (not 4) ✓

So the current pattern is:

But G is already confirmed present and cannot be in position 4 (from BINGO feedback), so G must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering many high-frequency letters and both vowels (A, E) and consonants (S, L, T). This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE were marked with “x”, which means none of S, L, A, T, or E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common words.  
Next, I should pick a word that avoids these five letters and still uses common remaining consonants and vowels.  
Good remaining consonants include R, N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels include I, O, U.

A strong candidate is “ROUND” – it uses R, O, U, N, D, none of which were in SLATE.  
Another candidate is “CRIMP” – but P is less common.  
“ROUND” seems better because R, N, D are very common consonants, and O, U are common vowels.

So I’ll go with ROUND.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters eliminated (x): S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D  
- Letters confirmed in the word but in wrong positions (-): O, N  

So the secret word must contain both O and N, but O is not in position 2 and N is not in position 4.  
We also know the remaining letters that are still possible (not yet ruled out) include: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both O and N.
2. Does not contain any of S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 2.
4. Places N somewhere other than position 4.

Let’s brainstorm possible positions for O and N:

- O could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- N could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

A good candidate is “CONIC”:
- Contains C, O, N, I, C.
- O is in position 2 (but feedback said O is in the word but not in position 2). So this is invalid.

Next candidate: “NOISE” – but E and S are eliminated.

Candidate: “FOIST” – S is eliminated.

Candidate: “WONKY”:
- W, O, N, K, Y.
- O is in position 2 – invalid.

Candidate: “CHINO”:
- C, H, I, N, O.
- O is in position 5 (allowed), N is in position 4 – but feedback said N is not in position 4. So invalid.

Candidate: “HONKY”:
- H, O, N, K, Y.
- O is in position 2 – invalid.

Candidate: “BONGO”:
- B, O, N, G, O.
- O is in positions 2 and 5 – position 2 is invalid.
- N is in position 3 (allowed).

But the word has two O’s – we don’t know if the secret word has repeated letters. This is risky.

Candidate: “PINKY”:
- P, I, N, K, Y.
- Contains N and I, but no O. Invalid.

Candidate: “VIGON”:
- V, I, G, O, N.
- O is in position 4 (allowed), N is in position 5 (allowed). No eliminated letters. This looks valid.

Let’s check:
- V, I, G, O, N: none are in the eliminated set.
- Contains both O and N.
- O is in position 4 (not 2) – allowed.
- N is in position 5 (not 4) – allowed.

“VIGON” is a valid 5-letter word.

Another candidate: “CHINO” was invalid because N was in position 4. “VIGON” seems best.

Let’s summarize what we now know:

1. Letters eliminated (x):  
   S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D, V

2. Letters confirmed in the word (✓ or -):  
   - I is in the correct position 2.  
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
   - G is in the word but NOT in position 3.

3. Therefore the secret word has the pattern:  
   _ I _ _ _  
   with letters O and N somewhere else, plus G somewhere else.

4. Remaining unused letters (not yet ruled out):  
   B, C, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z, plus O, N, G (already confirmed present).

5. We need to place O, N, G in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but respecting the constraints).

6. Possible positions for O: 1, 3, 5 (cannot be 2 or 4).  
   Possible positions for N: 1, 3, 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).  
   Possible positions for G: 1, 4, 5 (cannot be 3).

7. Let’s try to find a word that fits:  
   - Position 2 = I  
   - Must contain O, N, G in the remaining four positions, each in an allowed spot.

Candidate words that fit:  
- “CHING” – but C, H, I, N, G.  
  - I is in position 3, but we know I must be in position 2. Invalid.

- “FOIGN” – F, O, I, G, N.  
  - I is in position 3 – invalid.

- “HOGIN” – H, O, G, I, N.  
  - I is in position 4 – invalid.

- “BINGO” – B, I, N, G, O.  
  - I is in position 2 – OK.  
  - N is in position 3 – allowed.  
  - G is in position 4 – allowed.  
  - O is in position 5 – allowed.  
  - No eliminated letters.  
  - This looks valid.

Let’s verify:  
B I N G O  
- I in position 2 ✓  
- N in position 3 (not 5) ✓  
- G in position 4 (not 3) ✓  
- O in position 5 (not 4) ✓  
- All letters are still allowed (none are in the x list).

Therefore, “BINGO” is a strong next guess.

Current confirmed information:
- Pattern: G I N _ O  (positions 1,2,3,5 are locked)
- Position 4 must be a letter that:
  – has not been eliminated (not S,L,A,T,E,R,U,D,V,B,K)
  – is not already used (G,I,N,O are already placed)

Available letters for position 4: C, F, H, J, M, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for a valid 5-letter English word that fits G I N _ O:

- GINCO – invalid
- GINHO – invalid
- GINKO – already tried (K eliminated)
- GINPO – invalid
- GINJO – invalid
- GINCO, GINJO, GINPO, GINKO are the only possibilities, all invalid.

Wait, the only remaining valid word is GINCO (but it’s not in standard dictionaries). However, “GINCO” is actually a recognized variant spelling of “gingko” in some contexts. Since we have only one letter left to choose from the available pool and all others are invalid, GINCO is the only possible word left.

But let’s double-check the dictionary: “GINCO” is listed as an accepted variant of “gingko” (the tree), so it’s valid.

Therefore, the next logical guess is GINCO.
