### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. A classic starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a broad sampling of letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Other good options could be ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""SLATE"" is a solid choice for its letter diversity and frequency.

From the feedback on SLATE:

A good next guess would be ""SHOCK"" because:

Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

- Uses D, R, I, P, S → none of the excluded letters
- Contains S (position 5) and K (not present) → wait, this misses K.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. A classic starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a broad sampling of letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Other good options could be ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""SLATE"" is a solid choice for its letter diversity and frequency.

From the feedback on SLATE:

So we know:

A good next guess would be ""SHOCK"" because:

Letters that **are** in the word, but whose positions we still don’t know:  
S (must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5)

We now have every single letter except D, F, H, L, O, P, T, and we still know the secret word must contain the letters S, K, R, I **exactly once each**.

That leaves only one possible 5-letter word that uses each of S, K, R, I once and one additional letter that is **not** in the forbidden set {D, F, H, L, O, P, T}. The remaining common letters are B, G, M, N, U, V, W, Y.

The only common English word that fits this pattern is “BRISK”.

Check:
- Letters used: B, R, I, S, K
- None of the forbidden letters appear.
- It contains S, K, R, I exactly once each.
