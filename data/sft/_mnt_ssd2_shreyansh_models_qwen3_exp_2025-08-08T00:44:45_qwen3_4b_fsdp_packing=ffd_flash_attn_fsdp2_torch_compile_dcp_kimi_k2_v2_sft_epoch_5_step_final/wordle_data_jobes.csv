For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. A word like ""AROSE"" uses five of these high-frequency letters, including three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

   - E is in position 4 (✓)
   - S is in word but NOT in position 1 (because it was marked (-) there)
   - L and M are not in word (x)

So we know:
- Word pattern: _ O _ E _
- Must contain S somewhere, but not in position 1.
- Must NOT contain A, R, L, M.
- Already have O, E, S confirmed.

Letters still allowed (excluding A, R, L, M): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to place S in position 2, 3, or 5 (but position 2 is O, so S can be 3 or 5).

Possible patterns:
- _ O S E _
- _ O _ E S

Looking for common words:
- For _ O S E _: ""POSE"" is 4 letters, ""COSE"" not a word, ""POSES"" is 6 letters, ""JOSE"" is 4 letters, ""DOSE"" is 4 letters, ""HOSE"" is 4 letters, ""VOSE"" not common.
- For _ O _ E S: ""HOUSE"" has U and H, ""POSES"" again 6 letters, ""COVES"" has V, ""DOVES"" has V, ""HOUSES"" too long, ""JOVES"" not common, ""NOVES"" not common, ""POVES"" not common, ""TOVES"" not common.

Looking at _ O _ E S:
- ""HOUSE"" is 5 letters but has H and U which are allowed.
- ""COVES"" has C, V, E, S: but C and V are allowed.
- ""DOVES"" has D, V, E, S: D and V allowed.
- ""HOUSES"" is 6 letters.
- ""JOVES"" not a valid word.
- ""NOVES"" not a valid word.

- O is 2 (✓), E is 4 (✓), S is 5 (✓), H and U are new letters.
- This fits all constraints: contains O, E, S; S not in position 1; no A, R, L, M.

""COVES"":
- C, O, V, E, S: positions 1-5.
- O is 2 (✓), E is 4 (✓), S is 5 (✓), C and V are new letters.

""COVES"":

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. A word like ""AROSE"" uses five of these high-frequency letters, including three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, E but not A or R.
- O is not in position 3, S is not in position 4, E is not in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that includes O, S, E, avoids A and R, and respects the positional exclusions above. Good candidates might be:
- SOUSE – but S is in position 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), U not yet ruled out, S again in 4 (but S cannot be in 4, so this is invalid).
- SOLEM – has E in position 4 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), S in 1 (allowed), L and M new letters.
- OSEES – has E in 5 (invalid, E cannot be in 5).
- SOOTE – has O in 3 (invalid, O cannot be in 3).
- SEPOS – has O in 3 (invalid).
- OSEMS – has O in 2 (allowed), S in 4 (invalid).
- OSELS – has O in 2 (allowed), S in 4 (invalid).
- OSEMS – same issue.
- OSEMS – same issue.

A better candidate is SOLEM:
- Letters: S, O, L, E, M.
- Contains O, S, E.
- Avoids A and R.
- Positions:
  - S in 1 (allowed, no restriction on S in 1).
  - O in 2 (allowed, no restriction on O in 2).
  - L and M are new.
  - E in 4 (allowed, no restriction on E in 4).
  - M is new.

This seems valid.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SOLEM -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) L(x) E(✓) M(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
   - Letters in word: O, S, E
   - Letters not in word: A, R, L, M

2. SOLEM → S(-) O(✓) L(x) E(✓) M(x)
   - O is in position 2 (✓)
   - E is in position 4 (✓)
   - S is in word but NOT in position 1 (because it was marked (-) there)
   - L and M are not in word (x)

So we know:
- Word pattern: _ O _ E _
- Must contain S somewhere, but not in position 1.
- Must NOT contain A, R, L, M.
- Already have O, E, S confirmed.

Letters still allowed (excluding A, R, L, M): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to place S in position 2, 3, or 5 (but position 2 is O, so S can be 3 or 5).

Possible patterns:
- _ O S E _
- _ O _ E S

Looking for common words:
- For _ O S E _: ""POSE"" is 4 letters, ""COSE"" not a word, ""POSES"" is 6 letters, ""JOSE"" is 4 letters, ""DOSE"" is 4 letters, ""HOSE"" is 4 letters, ""VOSE"" not common.
- For _ O _ E S: ""HOUSE"" has U and H, ""POSES"" again 6 letters, ""COVES"" has V, ""DOVES"" has V, ""HOUSES"" too long, ""JOVES"" not common, ""NOVES"" not common, ""POVES"" not common, ""TOVES"" not common.

Looking at _ O _ E S:
- ""HOUSE"" is 5 letters but has H and U which are allowed.
- ""COVES"" has C, V, E, S: but C and V are allowed.
- ""DOVES"" has D, V, E, S: D and V allowed.
- ""HOUSES"" is 6 letters.
- ""JOVES"" not a valid word.
- ""NOVES"" not a valid word.
- ""POVES"" not a valid word.
- ""TOVES"" not a valid word.

""COVES"" and ""DOVES"" are valid, but let's check ""HOUSE"":
- H, O, U, S, E: positions 1-5.
- O is 2 (✓), E is 4 (✓), S is 5 (✓), H and U are new letters.
- This fits all constraints: contains O, E, S; S not in position 1; no A, R, L, M.

""COVES"":
- C, O, V, E, S: positions 1-5.
- O is 2 (✓), E is 4 (✓), S is 5 (✓), C and V are new letters.
- Also valid.

Between ""HOUSE"" and ""COVES"", both are valid. ""HOUSE"" is more common, so I'll go with that.

But wait, let's check ""HOUSE"":
- H, O, U, S, E
- O in 2 (✓), E in 4 (✓), S in 5 (✓), no A, R, L, M.
- Valid.

""COVES"":
- C, O, V, E, S
- Same checks: valid.

I'll choose ""HOUSE"" as it's more common.

But let's think if there's a better word. Another option is ""VOSES"" but that's not a word. ""HOSES"" is 5 letters but S is in position 4 which is allowed (no restriction on S in 4 yet), but we know S is in word but not in position 1. So S could be 3 or 5.

Looking at _ O _ E S:
- ""HOUSE"" fits perfectly.
- ""COVES"" also fits.

I'll go with ""HOUSE"".

From all feedback so far:

Letters we know are in the word: O (position 2), E (position 4), S (somewhere, but not positions 1 or 5).

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, L, M, H, U.

Current pattern: _ O _ E _

S must be in position 3 (since it can’t be 1 or 5).

So the word looks like: _ O S E _

Letters still allowed (excluding A, R, L, M, H, U): B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word matching _ O S E _.

Possible candidates:
- BOSER – but R is excluded.
- COSER – R excluded.
- DOSER – R excluded.
- FOSSE – F, O, S, S, E – but double S might be possible, and F, O, S, E are allowed.
- GOSSE – G, O, S, S, E – double S.
- POSSE – P, O, S, S, E – double S.
- TOSSE – T, O, S, S, E – double S.
- VOSSE – V, O, S, S, E – double S.
- WOSSE – W, O, S, S, E – double S.

""POSES"" – but S is in position 5, which is invalid (S cannot be 5).

""FOSSE"" seems valid: F, O, S, S, E – all letters allowed, and S is in position 3.

But let's check if there's a single S word:
- BOSER – R excluded.
- COSER – R excluded.
- DOSER – R excluded.
- GOSSE – double S.
- POSSE – double S.
- TOSSE – double S.
- VOSSE – double S.
- WOSSE – double S.

""FOSSE"" is the only valid single-S word here, but it has two S's. However, the rules don't forbid duplicate letters, so it's acceptable.

But wait, let's think if there's a word with one S:
- BOSSE – B, O, S, S, E – double S.
- COSSE – C, O, S, S, E – double S.
- DOSSE – double S.
- GOSSE – double S.
- POSSE – double S.
- TOSSE – double S.
- VOSSE – double S.
- WOSSE – double S.

Actually, ""FOSSE"" is the only one with two S's. But we know S is in position 3, so the word must have S in position 3. Therefore, the word must be _ O S E _.

Looking at valid words:
- BOSSE – B, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.
- COSSE – C, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.
- DOSSE – D, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.
- FOSSE – F, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.
- GOSSE – G, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.
- POSSE – P, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.
- TOSSE – T, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.
- VOSSE – V, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.
- WOSSE – W, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.

All these have double S, which is possible. But is there a word with single S?

Looking again, ""BOSSE"" is the only common word, but it has double S. However, the rules don't forbid duplicate letters, so it's acceptable.

But let's think differently: maybe the word is ""POSES"" but S is in position 5, which is invalid. So no.

Another approach: maybe the word is ""BOSE"" but that's 4 letters.

Actually, the only valid 5-letter word with pattern _ O S E _ is ""BOSE"" (but 4 letters) or ""FOSSE"", ""COSSE"", etc., which all have double S.

Given that, ""FOSSE"" seems the most common.

But let's check if ""BOSE"" can be extended: ""BOSES"" – but S is in position 5, invalid.

Therefore, the only valid word seems to be one with double S, like ""FOSSE"".

But let's verify:
- F, O, S, S, E: all letters allowed, S in position 3, O in 2, E in 4.
- No A, R, L, M, H, U.

""FOSSE"" is valid.

However, ""BOSE"" is 4 letters, so we need 5 letters.

Another candidate: ""COSSE"" – but C, O, S, S, E – valid.

But ""FOSSE"" is more common.

I'll go with ""FOSSE"".

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. A word like ""AROSE"" uses five of these high-frequency letters, including three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, E but not A or R.
- O is not in position 3, S is not in position 4, E is not in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that includes O, S, E, avoids A and R, and respects the positional exclusions above. Good candidates might be:

A better candidate is SOLEM:
- Letters: S, O, L, E, M.
- Contains O, S, E.
- Avoids A and R.
- Positions:
  - S in 1 (allowed, no restriction on S in 1).
  - O in 2 (allowed, no restriction on O in 2).
  - L and M are new.
  - E in 4 (allowed, no restriction on E in 4).
  - M is new.

This seems valid.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
Guess 2: SOLEM -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) L(x) E(✓) M(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
   - Letters in word: O, S, E
   - Letters not in word: A, R, L, M

2. SOLEM → S(-) O(✓) L(x) E(✓) M(x)
   - O is in position 2 (✓)
   - E is in position 4 (✓)
   - S is in word but NOT in position 1 (because it was marked (-) there)
   - L and M are not in word (x)

So we know:
- Word pattern: _ O _ E _
- Must contain S somewhere, but not in position 1.
- Must NOT contain A, R, L, M.
- Already have O, E, S confirmed.

Letters still allowed (excluding A, R, L, M): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to place S in position 2, 3, or 5 (but position 2 is O, so S can be 3 or 5).

Possible patterns:
- _ O S E _
- _ O _ E S

Looking for common words:
- For _ O S E _: ""POSE"" is 4 letters, ""COSE"" not a word, ""POSES"" is 6 letters, ""JOSE"" is 4 letters, ""DOSE"" is 4 letters, ""HOSE"" is 4 letters, ""VOSE"" not common.
- For _ O _ E S: ""HOUSE"" has U and H, ""POSES"" again 6 letters, ""COVES"" has V, ""DOVES"" has V, ""HOUSES"" too long, ""JOVES"" not common, ""NOVES"" not common, ""POVES"" not common, ""TOVES"" not common.

Looking at _ O _ E S:
- ""HOUSE"" is 5 letters but has H and U which are allowed.
- ""COVES"" has C, V, E, S: but C and V are allowed.
- ""DOVES"" has D, V, E, S: D and V allowed.
- ""HOUSES"" is 6 letters.
- ""JOVES"" not a valid word.
- ""NOVES"" not a valid word.
- ""POVES"" not a valid word.
- ""TOVES"" not a valid word.

""COVES"" and ""DOVES"" are valid, but let's check ""HOUSE"":
- H, O, U, S, E: positions 1-5.
- O is 2 (✓), E is 4 (✓), S is 5 (✓), H and U are new letters.
- This fits all constraints: contains O, E, S; S not in position 1; no A, R, L, M.

""COVES"":
- C, O, V, E, S: positions 1-5.
- O is 2 (✓), E is 4 (✓), S is 5 (✓), C and V are new letters.
- Also valid.

Between ""HOUSE"" and ""COVES"", both are valid. ""HOUSE"" is more common, so I'll go with that.

But wait, let's check ""HOUSE"":
- H, O, U, S, E
- O in 2 (✓), E in 4 (✓), S in 5 (✓), no A, R, L, M.
- Valid.

""COVES"":
- C, O, V, E, S
- Same checks: valid.

I'll choose ""HOUSE"" as it's more common.

But let's think if there's a better word. Another option is ""VOSES"" but that's not a word. ""HOSES"" is 5 letters but S is in position 4 which is allowed (no restriction on S in 4 yet), but we know S is in word but not in position 1. So S could be 3 or 5.

Looking at _ O _ E S:
- ""HOUSE"" fits perfectly.
- ""COVES"" also fits.

I'll go with ""HOUSE"".

From all feedback so far:

Letters we know are in the word: O (position 2), E (position 4), S (somewhere, but not positions 1 or 5).

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, L, M, H, U.

Current pattern: _ O _ E _

S must be in position 3 (since it can’t be 1 or 5).

So the word looks like: _ O S E _

Letters still allowed (excluding A, R, L, M, H, U): B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word matching _ O S E _.

Possible candidates:
- BOSER – but R is excluded.
- COSER – R excluded.
- DOSER – R excluded.
- FOSSE – F, O, S, S, E – but double S might be possible, and F, O, S, E are allowed.
- GOSSE – G, O, S, S, E – double S.
- POSSE – P, O, S, S, E – double S.
- TOSSE – T, O, S, S, E – double S.
- VOSSE – V, O, S, S, E – double S.
- WOSSE – W, O, S, S, E – double S.

""POSES"" – but S is in position 5, which is invalid (S cannot be 5).

""FOSSE"" seems valid: F, O, S, S, E – all letters allowed, and S is in position 3.

But let's check if there's a single S word:
- BOSER – R excluded.
- COSER – R excluded.
- DOSER – R excluded.
- GOSSE – double S.
- POSSE – double S.
- TOSSE – double S.
- VOSSE – double S.
- WOSSE – double S.

""FOSSE"" is the only valid single-S word here, but it has two S's. However, the rules don't forbid duplicate letters, so it's acceptable.

But wait, let's think if there's a word with one S:
- BOSSE – B, O, S, S, E – double S.
- COSSE – C, O, S, S, E – double S.
- DOSSE – double S.
- GOSSE – double S.
- POSSE – double S.
- TOSSE – double S.
- VOSSE – double S.
- WOSSE – double S.

Actually, ""FOSSE"" is the only one with two S's. But we know S is in position 3, so the word must have S in position 3. Therefore, the word must be _ O S E _.

Looking at valid words:
- BOSSE – B, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.
- COSSE – C, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.
- DOSSE – D, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.
- FOSSE – F, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.
- GOSSE – G, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.
- POSSE – P, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.
- TOSSE – T, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.
- VOSSE – V, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.
- WOSSE – W, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.

All these have double S, which is possible. But is there a word with single S?

Looking again, ""BOSSE"" is the only common word, but it has double S. However, the rules don't forbid duplicate letters, so it's acceptable.

But let's think differently: maybe the word is ""POSES"" but S is in position 5, which is invalid. So no.

Another approach: maybe the word is ""BOSE"" but that's 4 letters.

Actually, the only valid 5-letter word with pattern _ O S E _ is ""BOSE"" (but 4 letters) or ""FOSSE"", ""COSSE"", etc., which all have double S.

Given that, ""FOSSE"" seems the most common.

But let's check if ""BOSE"" can be extended: ""BOSES"" – but S is in position 5, invalid.

Therefore, the only valid word seems to be one with double S, like ""FOSSE"".

But let's verify:
- F, O, S, S, E: all letters allowed, S in position 3, O in 2, E in 4.
- No A, R, L, M, H, U.

""FOSSE"" is valid.

However, ""BOSE"" is 4 letters, so we need 5 letters.

Another candidate: ""COSSE"" – but C, O, S, S, E – valid.

But ""FOSSE"" is more common.

I'll go with ""FOSSE"".Based on the feedback, the word must be _ O S E _ (with S in position 3), and cannot contain A, R, L, M, H, U. The only common 5-letter word fitting this is:

From the latest feedback on FOSSE:
- F(x) – F is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in position 2 (already known).
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ O _ E _
- Must contain S somewhere, but S cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from all feedback).
- Therefore, S must be in position 2, but position 2 is already O.
- This is impossible, indicating an error in earlier assumptions.

Re-examining:
- From AROSE: O(-) means O is in the word but not in position 3.
- From SOLEM: O(✓) means O is in position 2.
- From HOUSE: O(✓) confirms O is in position 2.
- From FOSSE: O(✓) again confirms position 2.

So O is locked in position 2.

From AROSE: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 4.
From SOLEM: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 1.
From HOUSE: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 4 (redundant).
From FOSSE: S(-) means S is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4.

Thus S must be in position 5, but from AROSE: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5. This is a contradiction because E and S both cannot be in position 5.

Re-evaluating:
- From AROSE: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From SOLEM: E(✓) means E is in position 4.
- From HOUSE: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5 (consistent with E in 4).

So E is fixed in position 4.

Now S must be in position 3 or 5, but:
- From SOLEM: S(-) means S is not in position 1.
- From FOSSE: S(-) means S is not in positions 3 or 4.
- From AROSE: S(-) means S is not in position 4.

Thus S must be in position 3 or 5, but FOSSE feedback says S is not in 3 or 4. Position 5 is possible, but E is in 4, so position 5 is open.

But from AROSE: S(-) means S is not in position 4 (already known), but position 1 is also excluded.

Wait, let's list all exclusions for S:
- Position 1 (from SOLEM and HOUSE)
- Position 3 (from FOSSE)
- Position 4 (from AROSE and SOLEM)

Thus S must be in position 2 or 5, but position 2 is O. Therefore S must be in position 5.

But E is in position 4, so position 5 is open.

Thus the word must be _ O _ E S.

Letters allowed: any except A, R, L, M, H, U, F.

Possible letters for positions 1 and 3: B, C, D, G, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word _ O _ E S.

Possible candidates:
- B O _ E S → ""BOSES"" but S is in 5, valid.
- C O _ E S → ""COVES"" (C, O, V, E, S) – but V is allowed.
- D O _ E S → ""DOVES"" (D, O, V, E, S) – V is allowed.
- G O _ E S → ""GOSES"" – not a word.
- P O _ E S → ""POVES"" – not a word.
- T O _ E S → ""TOVES"" – not a word.
- V O _ E S → ""VOSES"" – not a word.

Valid words: ""BOSES"", ""COVES"", ""DOVES"".

""COVES"" and ""DOVES"" are common. Let's choose ""COVES"".

Check constraints:
- C, O, V, E, S – none of A, R, L, M, H, U, F.
- O in 2, E in 4, S in 5 – all constraints satisfied.

Thus S must be in position 5, but from AROSE: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5. This is a contradiction because E and S both cannot be in position 5.

Re-evaluating:
- From AROSE: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From SOLEM: E(✓) means E is in position 4.
- From HOUSE: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5 (consistent with E in 4).

So E is fixed in position 4.

Now S must be in position 3 or 5, but:
- From SOLEM: S(-) means S is not in position 1.
- From FOSSE: S(-) means S is not in positions 3 or 4.
- From AROSE: S(-) means S is not in position 4.

Thus S must be in position 3 or 5, but FOSSE feedback says S is not in 3 or 4. Position 5 is possible, but E is in 4, so position 5 is open.

But from AROSE: S(-) means S is not in position 4 (already known), but position 1 is also excluded.

Wait, let's list all exclusions for S:
- Position 1 (from SOLEM and HOUSE)
- Position 3 (from FOSSE)
- Position 4 (from AROSE and SOLEM)

Thus S must be in position 2 or 5, but position 2 is O. Therefore S must be in position 5.

But E is in position 4, so position 5 is open.

Thus the word must be _ O _ E S.

Letters allowed: any except A, R, L, M, H, U, F.

Possible letters for positions 1 and 3: B, C, D, G, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word _ O _ E S.

Possible candidates:
- B O _ E S → ""BOSES"" but S is in 5, valid.
- C O _ E S → ""COVES"" (C, O, V, E, S) – but V is allowed.
- D O _ E S → ""DOVES"" (D, O, V, E, S) – V is allowed.
- G O _ E S → ""GOSES"" – not a word.
- P O _ E S → ""POVES"" – not a word.
- T O _ E S → ""TOVES"" – not a word.
- V O _ E S → ""VOSES"" – not a word.

Valid words: ""BOSES"", ""COVES"", ""DOVES"".

""COVES"" and ""DOVES"" are common. Let's choose ""COVES"".

Check constraints:
- C, O, V, E, S – none of A, R, L, M, H, U, F.
- O in 2, E in 4, S in 5 – all constraints satisfied.Based on the feedback, the word must be _ O _ E S. The only valid common word fitting this pattern is:",Guess 5: COVES -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) V(x) E(✓) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. A word like ""AROSE"" uses five of these high-frequency letters, including three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains O, S, E but not A or R.
- O is not in position 3, S is not in position 4, E is not in position 5.

I need a new 5-letter word that includes O, S, E, avoids A and R, and respects the positional exclusions above. Good candidates might be:
- SOUSE – but S is in position 1 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), U not yet ruled out, S again in 4 (but S cannot be in 4, so this is invalid).
- SOLEM – has E in position 4 (allowed), O in 2 (allowed), S in 1 (allowed), L and M new letters.
- OSEES – has E in 5 (invalid, E cannot be in 5).
- SOOTE – has O in 3 (invalid, O cannot be in 3).
- SEPOS – has O in 3 (invalid).
- OSEMS – has O in 2 (allowed), S in 4 (invalid).
- OSELS – has O in 2 (allowed), S in 4 (invalid).
- OSEMS – same issue.
- OSEMS – same issue.

A better candidate is SOLEM:
- Letters: S, O, L, E, M.
- Contains O, S, E.
- Avoids A and R.
- Positions:
  - S in 1 (allowed, no restriction on S in 1).
  - O in 2 (allowed, no restriction on O in 2).
  - L and M are new.
  - E in 4 (allowed, no restriction on E in 4).
  - M is new.

This seems valid.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SOLEM -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) L(x) E(✓) M(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(-)
   - Letters in word: O, S, E
   - Letters not in word: A, R, L, M

2. SOLEM → S(-) O(✓) L(x) E(✓) M(x)
   - O is in position 2 (✓)
   - E is in position 4 (✓)
   - S is in word but NOT in position 1 (because it was marked (-) there)
   - L and M are not in word (x)

So we know:
- Word pattern: _ O _ E _
- Must contain S somewhere, but not in position 1.
- Must NOT contain A, R, L, M.
- Already have O, E, S confirmed.

Letters still allowed (excluding A, R, L, M): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to place S in position 2, 3, or 5 (but position 2 is O, so S can be 3 or 5).

Possible patterns:
- _ O S E _
- _ O _ E S

Looking for common words:
- For _ O S E _: ""POSE"" is 4 letters, ""COSE"" not a word, ""POSES"" is 6 letters, ""JOSE"" is 4 letters, ""DOSE"" is 4 letters, ""HOSE"" is 4 letters, ""VOSE"" not common.
- For _ O _ E S: ""HOUSE"" has U and H, ""POSES"" again 6 letters, ""COVES"" has V, ""DOVES"" has V, ""HOUSES"" too long, ""JOVES"" not common, ""NOVES"" not common, ""POVES"" not common, ""TOVES"" not common.

Looking at _ O _ E S:
- ""HOUSE"" is 5 letters but has H and U which are allowed.
- ""COVES"" has C, V, E, S: but C and V are allowed.
- ""DOVES"" has D, V, E, S: D and V allowed.
- ""HOUSES"" is 6 letters.
- ""JOVES"" not a valid word.
- ""NOVES"" not a valid word.
- ""POVES"" not a valid word.
- ""TOVES"" not a valid word.

""COVES"" and ""DOVES"" are valid, but let's check ""HOUSE"":
- H, O, U, S, E: positions 1-5.
- O is 2 (✓), E is 4 (✓), S is 5 (✓), H and U are new letters.
- This fits all constraints: contains O, E, S; S not in position 1; no A, R, L, M.

""COVES"":
- C, O, V, E, S: positions 1-5.
- O is 2 (✓), E is 4 (✓), S is 5 (✓), C and V are new letters.
- Also valid.

Between ""HOUSE"" and ""COVES"", both are valid. ""HOUSE"" is more common, so I'll go with that.

But wait, let's check ""HOUSE"":
- H, O, U, S, E
- O in 2 (✓), E in 4 (✓), S in 5 (✓), no A, R, L, M.
- Valid.

""COVES"":
- C, O, V, E, S
- Same checks: valid.

I'll choose ""HOUSE"" as it's more common.

But let's think if there's a better word. Another option is ""VOSES"" but that's not a word. ""HOSES"" is 5 letters but S is in position 4 which is allowed (no restriction on S in 4 yet), but we know S is in word but not in position 1. So S could be 3 or 5.

Looking at _ O _ E S:
- ""HOUSE"" fits perfectly.
- ""COVES"" also fits.

I'll go with ""HOUSE"".

From all feedback so far:

Letters we know are in the word: O (position 2), E (position 4), S (somewhere, but not positions 1 or 5).

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, R, L, M, H, U.

Current pattern: _ O _ E _

S must be in position 3 (since it can’t be 1 or 5).

So the word looks like: _ O S E _

Letters still allowed (excluding A, R, L, M, H, U): B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word matching _ O S E _.

Possible candidates:
- BOSER – but R is excluded.
- COSER – R excluded.
- DOSER – R excluded.
- FOSSE – F, O, S, S, E – but double S might be possible, and F, O, S, E are allowed.
- GOSSE – G, O, S, S, E – double S.
- POSSE – P, O, S, S, E – double S.
- TOSSE – T, O, S, S, E – double S.
- VOSSE – V, O, S, S, E – double S.
- WOSSE – W, O, S, S, E – double S.

""POSES"" – but S is in position 5, which is invalid (S cannot be 5).

""FOSSE"" seems valid: F, O, S, S, E – all letters allowed, and S is in position 3.

But let's check if there's a single S word:
- BOSER – R excluded.
- COSER – R excluded.
- DOSER – R excluded.
- GOSSE – double S.
- POSSE – double S.
- TOSSE – double S.
- VOSSE – double S.
- WOSSE – double S.

""FOSSE"" is the only valid single-S word here, but it has two S's. However, the rules don't forbid duplicate letters, so it's acceptable.

But wait, let's think if there's a word with one S:
- BOSSE – B, O, S, S, E – double S.
- COSSE – C, O, S, S, E – double S.
- DOSSE – double S.
- GOSSE – double S.
- POSSE – double S.
- TOSSE – double S.
- VOSSE – double S.
- WOSSE – double S.

Actually, ""FOSSE"" is the only one with two S's. But we know S is in position 3, so the word must have S in position 3. Therefore, the word must be _ O S E _.

Looking at valid words:
- BOSSE – B, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.
- COSSE – C, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.
- DOSSE – D, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.
- FOSSE – F, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.
- GOSSE – G, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.
- POSSE – P, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.
- TOSSE – T, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.
- VOSSE – V, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.
- WOSSE – W, O, S, S, E – valid, but double S.

All these have double S, which is possible. But is there a word with single S?

Looking again, ""BOSSE"" is the only common word, but it has double S. However, the rules don't forbid duplicate letters, so it's acceptable.

But let's think differently: maybe the word is ""POSES"" but S is in position 5, which is invalid. So no.

Another approach: maybe the word is ""BOSE"" but that's 4 letters.

Actually, the only valid 5-letter word with pattern _ O S E _ is ""BOSE"" (but 4 letters) or ""FOSSE"", ""COSSE"", etc., which all have double S.

Given that, ""FOSSE"" seems the most common.

But let's check if ""BOSE"" can be extended: ""BOSES"" – but S is in position 5, invalid.

Therefore, the only valid word seems to be one with double S, like ""FOSSE"".

But let's verify:
- F, O, S, S, E: all letters allowed, S in position 3, O in 2, E in 4.
- No A, R, L, M, H, U.

""FOSSE"" is valid.

However, ""BOSE"" is 4 letters, so we need 5 letters.

Another candidate: ""COSSE"" – but C, O, S, S, E – valid.

But ""FOSSE"" is more common.

I'll go with ""FOSSE"".Based on the feedback, the word must be _ O S E _ (with S in position 3), and cannot contain A, R, L, M, H, U. The only common 5-letter word fitting this is:

<|im_end|>

From the latest feedback on FOSSE:
- F(x) – F is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in position 2 (already known).
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ O _ E _
- Must contain S somewhere, but S cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from all feedback).
- Therefore, S must be in position 2, but position 2 is already O.
- This is impossible, indicating an error in earlier assumptions.

Re-examining:
- From AROSE: O(-) means O is in the word but not in position 3.
- From SOLEM: O(✓) means O is in position 2.
- From HOUSE: O(✓) confirms O is in position 2.
- From FOSSE: O(✓) again confirms position 2.

So O is locked in position 2.

From AROSE: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 4.
From SOLEM: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 1.
From HOUSE: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 4 (redundant).
From FOSSE: S(-) means S is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4.

Thus S must be in position 5, but from AROSE: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5. This is a contradiction because E and S both cannot be in position 5.

Re-evaluating:
- From AROSE: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5.
- From SOLEM: E(✓) means E is in position 4.
- From HOUSE: E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5 (consistent with E in 4).

So E is fixed in position 4.

Now S must be in position 3 or 5, but:
- From SOLEM: S(-) means S is not in position 1.
- From FOSSE: S(-) means S is not in positions 3 or 4.
- From AROSE: S(-) means S is not in position 4.

Thus S must be in position 3 or 5, but FOSSE feedback says S is not in 3 or 4. Position 5 is possible, but E is in 4, so position 5 is open.

But from AROSE: S(-) means S is not in position 4 (already known), but position 1 is also excluded.

Wait, let's list all exclusions for S:
- Position 1 (from SOLEM and HOUSE)
- Position 3 (from FOSSE)
- Position 4 (from AROSE and SOLEM)

Thus S must be in position 2 or 5, but position 2 is O. Therefore S must be in position 5.

But E is in position 4, so position 5 is open.

Thus the word must be _ O _ E S.

Letters allowed: any except A, R, L, M, H, U, F.

Possible letters for positions 1 and 3: B, C, D, G, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word _ O _ E S.

Possible candidates:
- B O _ E S → ""BOSES"" but S is in 5, valid.
- C O _ E S → ""COVES"" (C, O, V, E, S) – but V is allowed.
- D O _ E S → ""DOVES"" (D, O, V, E, S) – V is allowed.
- G O _ E S → ""GOSES"" – not a word.
- P O _ E S → ""POVES"" – not a word.
- T O _ E S → ""TOVES"" – not a word.
- V O _ E S → ""VOSES"" – not a word.

Valid words: ""BOSES"", ""COVES"", ""DOVES"".

""COVES"" and ""DOVES"" are common. Let's choose ""COVES"".

Remaining letters that can fill positions 1 and 3:  
B, D, G, I, J, K, N, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word matching the pattern _ O _ E S.

Scanning common words:

- BOSES – not a standard word  
- DOSES – D, O, S, E, S – but S is already in position 5, so double S at end is allowed  
- GOSES – not a word  
- POSES – P, O, S, E, S – valid word  
- TOSES – not a word  
- WOTES – not a word  

Among these, ""DOSES"" and ""POSES"" are both valid.  
""DOSES"" uses D and S, both allowed.  
""POSES"" uses P and S, both allowed.

Between the two, ""DOSES"" seems slightly more common, so I’ll choose it.
