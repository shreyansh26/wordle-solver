### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, regardless of what the word actually is. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1 (✓)
- R is not in the word at all (x)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word starts with A.
2. It contains an S, but S is not in position 4.
3. It does NOT contain R, O, or E.

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S somewhere (but not in position 4), and avoiding R, O, E.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, or 5.

Let's think of words:
- ASIDE – but E is excluded.
- ACHES – has E, excluded.
- AULIC – doesn’t have S.
- ABBOT – no S.
- ABRIS – has R, excluded.
- ABLIS – no S.
- ACIDS – has E, excluded.
- ALCID – no S.
- ALCIS – no S.
- ALOES – has E, excluded.
- AMISS – has S in position 3 and 5, and no R, O, E.
- ANGST – has E, excluded.
- ANGUS – no S.
- ANGST – has E, excluded.
- APHID – no S.
- APHIS – has S in position 5, no R, O, E.
- AQUIS – has S in position 5, no R, O, E.
- ASHES – has E, excluded.
- ASHOK – has O, excluded.
- ASIDE – has E, excluded.
- ASIAN – has E, excluded.
- ASKED – has E, excluded.
- ASKIS – has S in position 3, no R, O, E.

Looking at valid options:
- AMISS – S in positions 3 and 5, no R, O, E.
- APHIS – S in position 5, no R, O, E.
- ASKIS – S in position 3, no R, O, E.

Among these, AMISS seems like a strong candidate because it has two S’s, which might help confirm S’s presence and position quickly. However, ASKIS is also valid. Let’s go with AMISS as it covers more possibilities.

Wait, let’s double-check:
- AMISS: A(✓), M, I, S(-), S(-). But S is already known to be in the word but not in position 4. In AMISS, S appears in positions 4 and 5. Position 4 is the same as the original feedback (S in position 4 was marked wrong), so S cannot be in position 4. Therefore, AMISS is invalid because it puts S in position 4.

Next option: APHIS
- A(✓), P, H, I, S(-). S is in position 5, which is new, so this is valid.

Another option: ASKIS
- A(✓), S, K, I, S(-). S appears in positions 2 and 5. Position 2 is new, so this is valid.

Between APHIS and ASKIS, ASKIS might be better because it places S in position 2 (new) and keeps S in position 5 (already known). Let’s go with ASKIS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, regardless of what the word actually is. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1 (✓)
- R is not in the word at all (x)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word starts with A.
2. It contains an S, but S is not in position 4.
3. It does NOT contain R, O, or E.

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S somewhere (but not in position 4), and avoiding R, O, E.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, or 5.

Let's think of words:
- ASIDE – but E is excluded.
- ACHES – has E, excluded.
- AULIC – doesn’t have S.
- ABBOT – no S.
- ABRIS – has R, excluded.
- ABLIS – no S.
- ACIDS – has E, excluded.
- ALCID – no S.
- ALCIS – no S.
- ALOES – has E, excluded.
- AMISS – has S in position 3 and 5, and no R, O, E.
- ANGST – has E, excluded.
- ANGUS – no S.
- ANGST – has E, excluded.
- APHID – no S.
- APHIS – has S in position 5, no R, O, E.
- AQUIS – has S in position 5, no R, O, E.
- ASHES – has E, excluded.
- ASHOK – has O, excluded.
- ASIDE – has E, excluded.
- ASIAN – has E, excluded.
- ASKED – has E, excluded.
- ASKIS – has S in position 3, no R, O, E.

Looking at valid options:
- AMISS – S in positions 3 and 5, no R, O, E.
- APHIS – S in position 5, no R, O, E.
- ASKIS – S in position 3, no R, O, E.

Among these, AMISS seems like a strong candidate because it has two S’s, which might help confirm S’s presence and position quickly. However, ASKIS is also valid. Let’s go with AMISS as it covers more possibilities.

Wait, let’s double-check:
- AMISS: A(✓), M, I, S(-), S(-). But S is already known to be in the word but not in position 4. In AMISS, S appears in positions 4 and 5. Position 4 is the same as the original feedback (S in position 4 was marked wrong), so S cannot be in position 4. Therefore, AMISS is invalid because it puts S in position 4.

Next option: APHIS
- A(✓), P, H, I, S(-). S is in position 5, which is new, so this is valid.

Another option: ASKIS
- A(✓), S, K, I, S(-). S appears in positions 2 and 5. Position 2 is new, so this is valid.

Between APHIS and ASKIS, ASKIS might be better because it places S in position 2 (new) and keeps S in position 5 (already known). Let’s go with ASKIS.

From the two rounds of feedback:

   - First letter is A.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - Letters R, O, E are NOT in the word.

2. ASKIS → A(✓) S(-) K(x) I(x) S(✓)
   - First letter is still A.
   - S is in the word, but now we know:
     - It is NOT in position 2 (because the first S in ASKIS got “-”).
     - It IS in position 5 (because the second S in ASKIS got “✓”).
   - Letters K and I are NOT in the word.

So far we have:
- Pattern: A _ _ _ S
- Letters known to be absent: R, O, E, K, I
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, ending with S, with no R, O, E, K, I, and with S only in position 5.

Possible candidates:
- AULIS – but I is excluded.
- ANGUS – but G and U are allowed, but we need to check for excluded letters.
- ACHOS – but O is excluded.
- ABDUS – but D and U are allowed.
- AMBOS – but O is excluded.
- ACHOS – O excluded.
- ABDUS – B, D, U, S are allowed.
- ABDUS seems valid: A B D U S.

Another candidate: ABDUS (A B D U S) – checks all boxes.

- ACHYS – but Y is allowed, but we need to check other letters.
- ACHYS – A C H Y S. All letters (A, C, H, Y, S) are allowed and fit the pattern.

Another candidate: ACHYS (A C H Y S).

Let me verify:
- Starts with A (✓).
- Ends with S (✓).
- No R, O, E, K, I, B, D, U.
- S only in position 5 (✓).

So ACHYS is a valid next guess.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, regardless of what the word actually is. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1 (✓)
- R is not in the word at all (x)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word starts with A.
2. It contains an S, but S is not in position 4.
3. It does NOT contain R, O, or E.

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing S somewhere (but not in position 4), and avoiding R, O, E.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, or 5.

Let's think of words:
- ASIDE – but E is excluded.
- ACHES – has E, excluded.
- AULIC – doesn’t have S.
- ABBOT – no S.
- ABRIS – has R, excluded.
- ABLIS – no S.
- ACIDS – has E, excluded.
- ALCID – no S.
- ALCIS – no S.
- ALOES – has E, excluded.
- AMISS – has S in position 3 and 5, and no R, O, E.
- ANGST – has E, excluded.
- ANGUS – no S.
- ANGST – has E, excluded.
- APHID – no S.
- APHIS – has S in position 5, no R, O, E.
- AQUIS – has S in position 5, no R, O, E.
- ASHES – has E, excluded.
- ASHOK – has O, excluded.
- ASIDE – has E, excluded.
- ASIAN – has E, excluded.
- ASKED – has E, excluded.
- ASKIS – has S in position 3, no R, O, E.

Looking at valid options:
- AMISS – S in positions 3 and 5, no R, O, E.
- APHIS – S in position 5, no R, O, E.
- ASKIS – S in position 3, no R, O, E.

Among these, AMISS seems like a strong candidate because it has two S’s, which might help confirm S’s presence and position quickly. However, ASKIS is also valid. Let’s go with AMISS as it covers more possibilities.

Wait, let’s double-check:
- AMISS: A(✓), M, I, S(-), S(-). But S is already known to be in the word but not in position 4. In AMISS, S appears in positions 4 and 5. Position 4 is the same as the original feedback (S in position 4 was marked wrong), so S cannot be in position 4. Therefore, AMISS is invalid because it puts S in position 4.

Next option: APHIS
- A(✓), P, H, I, S(-). S is in position 5, which is new, so this is valid.

Another option: ASKIS
- A(✓), S, K, I, S(-). S appears in positions 2 and 5. Position 2 is new, so this is valid.

Between APHIS and ASKIS, ASKIS might be better because it places S in position 2 (new) and keeps S in position 5 (already known). Let’s go with ASKIS.

     - It IS in position 5 (because the second S in ASKIS got “✓”).
   - Letters K and I are NOT in the word.

So far we have:
- Pattern: A _ _ _ S
- Letters known to be absent: R, O, E, K, I
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, ending with S, with no R, O, E, K, I, and with S only in position 5.

Possible candidates:
- AULIS – but I is excluded.
- ANGUS – but G and U are allowed, but we need to check for excluded letters.
- ACHOS – but O is excluded.
- ABDUS – but D and U are allowed.
- AMBOS – but O is excluded.
- ACHOS – O excluded.
- ABDUS – B, D, U, S are allowed.
- ABDUS seems valid: A B D U S.

Another candidate: ABDUS (A B D U S) – checks all boxes.

Let me verify:

- ACHYS – but Y is allowed, but we need to check other letters.
- ACHYS – A C H Y S. All letters (A, C, H, Y, S) are allowed and fit the pattern.

Another candidate: ACHYS (A C H Y S).

Let me verify:
- Starts with A (✓).
- Ends with S (✓).
- No R, O, E, K, I, B, D, U.
- S only in position 5 (✓).

So ACHYS is a valid next guess.

From the four guesses we now have:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   - Word starts with A.  
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.  
   - Letters R, O, E are not in the word.

2. ASKIS → A(✓) S(-) K(x) I(x) S(✓)  
   - S is in position 5 (✓).  
   - S is not in position 2 (-).  
   - Letters K, I are not in the word.

3. ABDUS → A(✓) B(x) D(x) U(x) S(✓)  
   - B, D, U are not in the word.

4. ACHYS → A(✓) C(x) H(x) Y(x) S(✓)  
   - C, H, Y are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: A _ _ _ S  
- Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, E, K, I, B, D, U, C, H, Y  
- Letters still allowed: F, G, J, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A.  
- Ends with S.  
- Does not contain any of the forbidden letters.  
- Has S only in position 5.

Let’s list possible combinations for positions 2, 3, 4 using the remaining letters.

Remaining letters: F, G, J, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z

Possible middle letters:
- Position 2: F, G, J, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z  
- Position 3: same set  
- Position 4: same set

We need to find a valid English word of the form A _ _ _ S using only those letters.

Let’s scan the remaining letters for common combinations:

- A F L _ S → A F L _ S → A F L _ S → A F L _ S  
  Possible words: AFLOAT – but O is forbidden.  
  AFIELD – but E is forbidden.  
  AFIRMS – but R is forbidden.  
  AFIRST – R is forbidden.  
  AFLOAT – O is forbidden.  
  AFIELD – E is forbidden.  
  AFIRST – R is forbidden.  
  AFRIS – not a word.  

- A L F _ S → ALF _ S → ALF _ S → ALF _ S  
  ALFAL – not a word.  
  ALFAS – not a word.  
  ALFIS – not a word.  

- A M _ _ S → AM _ _ S  
  AMENS – N, E, S – E is forbidden.  
  AMISS – S is in position 5, but we already know S is in position 5, and we have two S’s which might be allowed, but we need to check if AMISS is valid.  
  AMISS – A M I S S – but I is forbidden.  

- A F _ _ S → A F _ _ S  
  AFORS – not a word.  
  AFRES – not a word.  
  AFUNS – not a word.  

- A F L _ S → A F L _ S  
  A F L _ S – need a valid word.  
  A F L A S – not a word.  
  A F L U S – U is forbidden.  

- A F L _ S – no valid words.

- A L _ _ S → A L _ _ S  
  ALF _ S – already checked.  
  ALG _ S – ALGOS – O is forbidden.  
  ALGAS – A is allowed, but S is in position 5.  
  ALGAS – A L G A S – but A is allowed, G is allowed, but we need to check if ALGAS is a valid word.  
  ALGAS – yes, it is a valid word (a type of algae).

Let’s check ALGAS:
- A(✓) L G A S  
- Letters: A, L, G, A, S – none of the forbidden letters (R, O, E, K, I, B, D, U, C, H, Y) are present.  
- Pattern: A _ _ _ S – fits perfectly.  
- S is in position 5 (✓).  

Therefore, ALGAS is a valid next guess.

From the five guesses we now have:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   - Word starts with A.  
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.  
   - Letters R, O, E are not in the word.

2. ASKIS → A(✓) S(-) K(x) I(x) S(✓)  
   - S is in position 5 (✓).  
   - S is not in position 2 (-).  
   - Letters K, I are not in the word.

3. ABDUS → A(✓) B(x) D(x) U(x) S(✓)  
   - B, D, U are not in the word.

4. ACHYS → A(✓) C(x) H(x) Y(x) S(✓)  
   - C, H, Y are not in the word.

5. ALGAS → A(✓) L(x) G(-) A(✓) S(✓)  
   - L is not in the word.  
   - G is in the word but not in position 3 (-).  
   - A is in position 4 (✓).  
   - S is in position 5 (✓).

So far we know:
- Pattern: A _ _ A S  
- Letters that are NOT in the word: R, O, E, K, I, B, D, U, C, H, Y, L  
- Letters still allowed: F, G, J, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z  
- G is in the word but not in position 3 (-).

Therefore, the word must be of the form A _ _ A S, with G somewhere in positions 2 or 4 (but position 4 is already A), so G must be in position 2 or 3. However, position 3 is now known to not contain G (from ALGAS feedback), so G must be in position 2.

Thus the pattern is: A G _ A S.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A, has G in position 2, A in position 4, and S in position 5.  
- Uses only allowed letters for position 3.

Allowed letters for position 3: F, J, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.
