For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should include as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 of the most common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and is a valid English word.

Let’s extract every constraint we have so far.

Known facts:
1. Position 4 = S (from CRISP feedback: S(✓) in position 4).
2. P is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (from SPONG feedback: P(-) in position 2).  
   Therefore P must be in position 4, but position 4 is already S.  
   This is a contradiction unless P is in position 4, but position 4 is S.  
   Therefore P must be in position 4, and S must be in position 4.  
   This is impossible unless the word has both P and S in position 4, which is impossible.  
   Therefore the only remaining possibility is that the feedback was misread.  
   Re-checking SPONG feedback:  
   S(-) P(-) O(-) N(x) G(x)  
   This means:
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   - P is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - N and G are NOT in the word.

So corrected facts:
- Position 4 = S (from CRISP feedback: S(✓) in position 4).  
- P is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from SPONG feedback: P(-) in position 2 and G(x) in position 5).  
   Therefore P must be in position 1, 3, or 4.  
   Position 4 is S, so P must be in position 1 or 3.  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from SPONG feedback: O(-) in position 3).  
- Forbidden letters: L, A, T, E, C, R, I, N, G.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- S in position 4.  
- P in position 1 or 3.  
- O somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5, but not 3).  
- Only allowed letters: B, D, F, H, K, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, plus P and S.

Let’s list possible words:
- If P is in position 1: P _ _ S _  
  We need O somewhere (positions 2, 3, or 5).  
  Possible: P O _ S _ → POSS (but S is in position 4, so this would be P O _ S _ → need 3rd letter).  
  Possible word: P O U S D (but D is allowed, but this is not a valid English word).  
  Another: P O S S _ (invalid, double S).  
  Another: P O U S H → P O U S H → positions: P(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), H(5).  
  Check constraints:
  - S in 4: ✓  
  - P in 1: allowed (P not excluded from 1).  
  - O in 2: allowed (O not excluded from 2).  
  - Letters: P, O, U, S, H – none forbidden.  
  This seems valid.

- If P is in position 3: _ _ P S _  
  We need O somewhere (positions 1, 2, or 5).  
  Possible: O _ P S _ → O U P S _ → OUPSS (invalid).  
  Possible: _ O P S _ → B O P S _ → BOPSS (invalid).  
  Possible: _ _ P S O → _ _ P S O → need first two letters.  
  Possible word: M O P S O (invalid, double O).  
  Possible: B O P S O (invalid).  
  Seems harder to find valid words with P in position 3.

Thus the most promising word is P O U S H.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should include as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 of the most common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and is a valid English word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback from SLATE tells us:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains S, but not in position 1.
2. The letters L, A, T, E are excluded.

Next, I want a word that:
- Includes S in a different position (not first).
- Uses none of L, A, T, E.
- Introduces as many new common letters as possible (R, I, N, O, C, U, D, M, etc.).

A good candidate is ""CRISP"":
- C, R, I, P, S
- S is in position 5 (not first), satisfying the feedback.
- No L, A, T, E.
- Uses common letters C, R, I, P.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

Guess 2: CRISP → C(x) R(x) I(x) S(✓) P(-)  
- S is now confirmed in position 4.  
- P is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
- C, R, I are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Position 4 = S  
- Word must contain P somewhere (but not in position 5).  
- Forbidden letters: L, A, T, E, C, R, I  
- Allowed letters (among the most common): B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y, plus P and S.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in position 4.  
2. Contains P somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).  
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.  

Let’s look for such a word.  
One straightforward candidate is “UPSET” – but T is forbidden.  
Another is “SPUNK” – but K is allowed, N is allowed, U is allowed, P is allowed, S is fixed in position 4. Wait, SPUNK has S in position 1, which is wrong (S must be in position 4).  
Try “PUNGS” – but S is in position 5, which is wrong.  
Try “SPEND” – E is forbidden.  
Try “SPONG” – O, N, G are allowed, P is in position 1, S in 4. This seems valid.  
Check letters: S, P, O, N, G – none are forbidden.  
Positions: P (1), U (2), N (3), S (4), G (5). This satisfies all constraints.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should include as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 of the most common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and is a valid English word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback from SLATE tells us:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains S, but not in position 1.
2. The letters L, A, T, E are excluded.

Next, I want a word that:
- Includes S in a different position (not first).
- Uses none of L, A, T, E.
- Introduces as many new common letters as possible (R, I, N, O, C, U, D, M, etc.).

A good candidate is ""CRISP"":
- C, R, I, P, S
- S is in position 5 (not first), satisfying the feedback.
- No L, A, T, E.
- Uses common letters C, R, I, P.

<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- L, A, T, E are NOT in the word at all.

Guess 2: CRISP → C(x) R(x) I(x) S(✓) P(-)  
- S is now confirmed in position 4.  
- P is in the word but NOT in position 5.  
- C, R, I are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Position 4 = S  
- Word must contain P somewhere (but not in position 5).  
- Forbidden letters: L, A, T, E, C, R, I  
- Allowed letters (among the most common): B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y, plus P and S.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in position 4.  
2. Contains P somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).  
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.  

Let’s look for such a word.  
One straightforward candidate is “UPSET” – but T is forbidden.  
Another is “SPUNK” – but K is allowed, N is allowed, U is allowed, P is allowed, S is fixed in position 4. Wait, SPUNK has S in position 1, which is wrong (S must be in position 4).  
Try “PUNGS” – but S is in position 5, which is wrong.  
Try “SPEND” – E is forbidden.  
Try “SPONG” – O, N, G are allowed, P is in position 1, S in 4. This seems valid.  
Check letters: S, P, O, N, G – none are forbidden.  
Positions: P (1), U (2), N (3), S (4), G (5). This satisfies all constraints.

Let’s go with “SPONG”.

Let’s extract every constraint we have so far.

Known facts:
1. Position 4 = S (from CRISP feedback: S(✓) in position 4).
2. P is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (from SPONG feedback: P(-) in position 2).  
   Therefore P must be in position 4, but position 4 is already S.  
   This is a contradiction unless P is in position 4, but position 4 is S.  
   Therefore P must be in position 4, and S must be in position 4.  
   This is impossible unless the word has both P and S in position 4, which is impossible.  
   Therefore the only remaining possibility is that the feedback was misread.  
   Re-checking SPONG feedback:  
   S(-) P(-) O(-) N(x) G(x)  
   This means:
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   - P is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - N and G are NOT in the word.

So corrected facts:
- Position 4 = S (from CRISP feedback: S(✓) in position 4).  
- P is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from SPONG feedback: P(-) in position 2 and G(x) in position 5).  
   Therefore P must be in position 1, 3, or 4.  
   Position 4 is S, so P must be in position 1 or 3.  
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from SPONG feedback: O(-) in position 3).  
- Forbidden letters: L, A, T, E, C, R, I, N, G.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- S in position 4.  
- P in position 1 or 3.  
- O somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5, but not 3).  
- Only allowed letters: B, D, F, H, K, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, plus P and S.

Let’s list possible words:
- If P is in position 1: P _ _ S _  
  We need O somewhere (positions 2, 3, or 5).  
  Possible: P O _ S _ → POSS (but S is in position 4, so this would be P O _ S _ → need 3rd letter).  
  Possible word: P O U S D (but D is allowed, but this is not a valid English word).  
  Another: P O S S _ (invalid, double S).  
  Another: P O U S H → P O U S H → positions: P(1), O(2), U(3), S(4), H(5).  
  Check constraints:
  - S in 4: ✓  
  - P in 1: allowed (P not excluded from 1).  
  - O in 2: allowed (O not excluded from 2).  
  - Letters: P, O, U, S, H – none forbidden.  
  This seems valid.

- If P is in position 3: _ _ P S _  
  We need O somewhere (positions 1, 2, or 5).  
  Possible: O _ P S _ → O U P S _ → OUPSS (invalid).  
  Possible: _ O P S _ → B O P S _ → BOPSS (invalid).  
  Possible: _ _ P S O → _ _ P S O → need first two letters.  
  Possible word: M O P S O (invalid, double O).  
  Possible: B O P S O (invalid).  
  Seems harder to find valid words with P in position 3.

Thus the most promising word is P O U S H.

From the feedback on Guess 5 (POKSY), we now know:

- Position 1 = P  
- Position 2 = O  
- Position 3 = K → but K is marked “x”, so K is NOT in the word.  
- Position 4 = S  
- Position 5 = Y  

So the word is: P O _ S Y, and the only blank is position 3.  
Forbidden letters so far: L, A, T, E, C, R, I, N, G, U, H, K.  
Allowed letters for position 3 (besides P, O, S, Y): B, D, F, M, V, W.

Valid 5-letter English words that fit P O _ S Y:
- P O B S Y → “POBSY” (not a valid word)  
- P O D S Y → “PODSY” (not valid)  
- P O F S Y → “POFSY” (not valid)  
- P O M S Y → “POMSY” (not valid)  
- P O V S Y → “POVSY” (not valid)  
- P O W S Y → “POWSY” (not valid)  

Wait—let me double-check a dictionary for P O _ S Y.  
Actually, the only valid English word that fits is:

P O M S Y → “POMSY” is not valid, but “POMSY” is not listed.  
Looking again, the only valid word is:

P O M S Y → no.  
Wait—“POMSY” is not valid, but “POMSY” is not valid.  
Hmm.  
Let me check: “POMSY” is not a recognized English word.  
“POMSY” is actually a dialectal variant of “pom-pom,” but it’s not standard.  
“POFSY” is not valid.  
“POVSY” is not valid.  
“POWSY” is not valid.  

But we have only one remaining letter slot: position 3.  
The only remaining allowed letters are B, D, F, M, V, W.  

The only valid English word that fits P O _ S Y is:

P O W S Y → “POWSY” (not valid).  
P O D S Y → “PODSY” (not valid).  

Wait—let me re-examine the allowed letters.  
We have P O _ S Y.  
Allowed letters for position 3: B, D, F, M, V, W.  

Looking up a Scrabble dictionary or standard English word list, the only valid word that fits is:
