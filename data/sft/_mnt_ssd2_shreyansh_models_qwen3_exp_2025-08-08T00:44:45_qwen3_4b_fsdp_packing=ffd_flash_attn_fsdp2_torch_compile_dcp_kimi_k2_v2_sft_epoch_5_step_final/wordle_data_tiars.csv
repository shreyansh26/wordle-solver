1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to quickly identify which ones are in the secret word.

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as it includes three vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (S, T, L). This gives a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L(x): L is not in the word at all.
- A(✓): A is in the word and in position 3.
- T(-): T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A (position 3), S, T
- Letters not in the word: L, E
- Positions ruled out: S not in 1, T not in 4

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 3
- Contains S and T somewhere (but not in the positions already ruled out)
- Does not contain L or E

Possible letters left: A, S, T plus other consonants and vowels except L, E.

A good next guess should place S and T in new positions and introduce new common letters. Let's try a word like ""STARS"":
- A in position 3 ✓
- S in positions 1 and 5 (but position 1 is ruled out for S, so this is invalid)

Let's consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (SLATE):
- A is in position 3 (✓)
- S is in the word but not in position 1 (-)
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- L and E are NOT in the word (x)

From Guess 2 (TAXIS):
- T is in position 1 (✓)
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)  ← This contradicts the first guess where A was confirmed in position 3. The only logical resolution is that the feedback symbols are positional and the second guess's A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 3, which would override the first guess's A(✓). This is impossible because the same word cannot simultaneously have A in position 3 and not in position 3. Therefore, the feedback must be interpreted as:
  - A(✓) in Guess 1: A is in position 3.
  - A(-) in Guess 2: A is in the word but not in position 3. This is a contradiction, so the only way this can happen is if the second guess's A(-) refers to the same A in position 3, which is impossible. Therefore, the feedback must have been misread. Re-reading:
    - Guess 2: TAXIS → T(✓) A(-) X(x) I(-) S(✓)
    - T is in position 1 (✓)
    - A is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
    - X is not in the word (x)
    - I is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
    - S is in the word but not in position 5 (✓ means correct position? Wait, no - the symbols are:
        - ✓: correct letter and position
        - -: correct letter, wrong position
        - x: letter not in word
    So:
    - T(✓) in Guess 2 means T is in position 1 and correct.
    - A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 2.
    - X(x) means X is not in the word.
    - I(-) means I is in the word but not in position 4.
    - S(✓) means S is in position 5 and correct.

So now we have:
- Position 1: T (✓)
- Position 5: S (✓)
- Position 3: A (from Guess 1) but Guess 2 says A is not in position 2. Since A was confirmed in position 3 in Guess 1, this is consistent - A is in position 3.
- Letters known to be in the word: T, A, S, I
- Letters known to be absent: L, E, X
- Additional constraints:
  - I is in the word but not in position 4
  - S is in position 5 (already)
  - T is in position 1 (already)

So the word structure is: T _ A _ S

We need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters that are not L, E, X, and must include I (since I is in the word but not in position 4). Therefore I must be in position 2.

So the word is: T I A _ S

Now we need a letter for position 4 that is not L, E, X, and is not already used (T, I, A, S). Common letters left: R, N, D, C, etc.

Possible words: T I A R S (TIARS - not a common word), T I A N S (TIANS - exists), T I A C S (TIACS - not common), T I A D S (TIADS - not common). The most common seems T I A N S.

Let's verify:
- T(✓) position 1
- I in position 2 (allowed, since I is in word but not in position 4)
- A in position 3 (✓ from Guess 1)
- N new letter
- S in position 5 (✓ from Guess 2)

This fits all constraints.
</think>

Based on the feedback:

1. T is fixed in position 1 (✓)
2. S is fixed in position 5 (✓)
3. A is fixed in position 3 (from Guess 1)
4. I is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
5. Therefore I must be in position 2
6. The word structure is now: T I A _ S

The only common 5-letter word fitting this pattern is TIANS.

<guess>TIANS</guess>",TIANS,"Let's consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (SLATE):
- A is in position 3 (✓)
- S is in the word but not in position 1 (-)
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- L and E are NOT in the word (x)

From Guess 2 (TAXIS):
- T is in position 1 (✓)
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)  ← This contradicts the first guess where A was confirmed in position 3. The only logical resolution is that the feedback symbols are positional and the second guess's A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 3, which would override the first guess's A(✓). This is impossible because the same word cannot simultaneously have A in position 3 and not in position 3. Therefore, the feedback must be interpreted as:
  - A(✓) in Guess 1: A is in position 3.
  - A(-) in Guess 2: A is in the word but not in position 3. This is a contradiction, so the only way this can happen is if the second guess's A(-) refers to the same A in position 3, which is impossible. Therefore, the feedback must have been misread. Re-reading:
    - Guess 2: TAXIS → T(✓) A(-) X(x) I(-) S(✓)
    - T is in position 1 (✓)
    - A is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
    - X is not in the word (x)
    - I is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
    - S is in the word but not in position 5 (✓ means correct position? Wait, no - the symbols are:
        - ✓: correct letter and position
        - -: correct letter, wrong position
        - x: letter not in word
    So:
    - T(✓) in Guess 2 means T is in position 1 and correct.
    - A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 2.
    - X(x) means X is not in the word.
    - I(-) means I is in the word but not in position 4.
    - S(✓) means S is in position 5 and correct.

So now we have:
- Position 1: T (✓)
- Position 5: S (✓)
- Position 3: A (from Guess 1) but Guess 2 says A is not in position 2. Since A was confirmed in position 3 in Guess 1, this is consistent - A is in position 3.
- Letters known to be in the word: T, A, S, I
- Letters known to be absent: L, E, X
- Additional constraints:
  - I is in the word but not in position 4
  - S is in position 5 (already)
  - T is in position 1 (already)

So the word structure is: T _ A _ S

We need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters that are not L, E, X, and must include I (since I is in the word but not in position 4). Therefore I must be in position 2.

So the word is: T I A _ S

Now we need a letter for position 4 that is not L, E, X, and is not already used (T, I, A, S). Common letters left: R, N, D, C, etc.

Possible words: T I A R S (TIARS - not a common word), T I A N S (TIANS - exists), T I A C S (TIACS - not common), T I A D S (TIADS - not common). The most common seems T I A N S.

Let's verify:
- T(✓) position 1
- I in position 2 (allowed, since I is in word but not in position 4)
- A in position 3 (✓ from Guess 1)
- N new letter
- S in position 5 (✓ from Guess 2)

This fits all constraints.Based on the feedback:

1. T is fixed in position 1 (✓)
2. S is fixed in position 5 (✓)
3. A is fixed in position 3 (from Guess 1)
4. I is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
5. Therefore I must be in position 2

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to quickly identify which ones are in the secret word.

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as it includes three vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (S, T, L). This gives a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L(x): L is not in the word at all.
- A(✓): A is in the word and in position 3.
- T(-): T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A (position 3), S, T
- Letters not in the word: L, E
- Positions ruled out: S not in 1, T not in 4

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 3
- Contains S and T somewhere (but not in the positions already ruled out)
- Does not contain L or E

Possible letters left: A, S, T plus other consonants and vowels except L, E.

A good next guess should place S and T in new positions and introduce new common letters. Let's try a word like ""STARS"":
- A in position 3 ✓
- S in positions 1 and 5 (but position 1 is ruled out for S, so this is invalid)
So STARS is invalid.

Next try ""STARF"":
- A in 3 ✓
- S in 1 (ruled out) x
Invalid.

Next try ""STAND"":
- A in 3 ✓
- S in 1 (ruled out) x
Invalid.

Next try ""STASH"":
- A in 3 ✓
- S in 1 and 4 (position 4 is ruled out for T, but S is allowed in 4)
- H is new letter
But we need T somewhere, and STASH doesn't have T. So invalid.

Next try ""STRAW"":
- A in 3 ✓
- S in 1 (ruled out) x
Invalid.

Next try ""STRAP"":
- A in 3 ✓
- S in 1 (ruled out) x
Invalid.

Next try ""STAIR"":
- A in 3 ✓
- S in 1 (ruled out) x
Invalid.

Next try ""TASER"":
- A in 3 ✓
- S in 2 (allowed)
- T in 1 (allowed)
- E is ruled out, so invalid.

Next try ""TASST"":
- A in 3 ✓
- S in 2 and 4 and 5
- T in 1
- No E or L
This seems valid.

But ""TASST"" is not a common word. Let's think of more common words.

Next try ""TASER"" - but E is ruled out.

Next try ""TAXIS"":
- A in 3 ✓
- S in 5 (allowed)
- T in 1 (allowed)
- X is new letter
- I is new letter
This seems valid.

""TAXIS"" is a common word and fits the constraints:
- A in 3
- T in 1 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)
- No L or E
- Introduces X and I for new information

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L(x): L is not in the word at all.
- A(✓): A is in the word and in position 3.
- T(-): T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A (position 3), S, T
- Letters not in the word: L, E
- Positions ruled out: S not in 1, T not in 4

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 3
- Contains S and T somewhere (but not in the positions already ruled out)
- Does not contain L or E

Possible letters left: A, S, T plus other consonants and vowels except L, E.

A good next guess should place S and T in new positions and introduce new common letters. Let's try a word like ""STARS"":
- A in position 3 ✓
- S in positions 1 and 5 (but position 1 is ruled out for S, so this is invalid)
So STARS is invalid.

Next try ""STARF"":
- A in 3 ✓
- S in 1 (ruled out) x
Invalid.

Next try ""STAND"":
- A in 3 ✓
- S in 1 (ruled out) x
Invalid.

Next try ""STASH"":
- A in 3 ✓
- S in 1 and 4 (position 4 is ruled out for T, but S is allowed in 4)
- H is new letter
But we need T somewhere, and STASH doesn't have T. So invalid.

Next try ""STRAW"":
- A in 3 ✓
- S in 1 (ruled out) x
Invalid.

Next try ""STRAP"":
- A in 3 ✓
- S in 1 (ruled out) x
Invalid.

Next try ""STAIR"":
- A in 3 ✓
- S in 1 (ruled out) x
Invalid.

Next try ""TASER"":
- A in 3 ✓
- S in 2 (allowed)
- T in 1 (allowed)
- E is ruled out, so invalid.

Next try ""TASST"":
- A in 3 ✓
- S in 2 and 4 and 5
- T in 1
- No E or L
This seems valid.

But ""TASST"" is not a common word. Let's think of more common words.

Next try ""TASER"" - but E is ruled out.

Next try ""TAXIS"":
- A in 3 ✓
- S in 5 (allowed)
- T in 1 (allowed)
- X is new letter
- I is new letter
This seems valid.

""TAXIS"" is a common word and fits the constraints:
- A in 3
- T in 1 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)
- No L or E
- Introduces X and I for new information

Let's consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (SLATE):
- A is in position 3 (✓)
- S is in the word but not in position 1 (-)
- T is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- L and E are NOT in the word (x)

From Guess 2 (TAXIS):
- T is in position 1 (✓)
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)  ← This contradicts the first guess where A was confirmed in position 3. The only logical resolution is that the feedback symbols are positional and the second guess's A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 3, which would override the first guess's A(✓). This is impossible because the same word cannot simultaneously have A in position 3 and not in position 3. Therefore, the feedback must be interpreted as:
  - A(✓) in Guess 1: A is in position 3.
  - A(-) in Guess 2: A is in the word but not in position 3. This is a contradiction, so the only way this can happen is if the second guess's A(-) refers to the same A in position 3, which is impossible. Therefore, the feedback must have been misread. Re-reading:
    - Guess 2: TAXIS → T(✓) A(-) X(x) I(-) S(✓)
    - T is in position 1 (✓)
    - A is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
    - X is not in the word (x)
    - I is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
    - S is in the word but not in position 5 (✓ means correct position? Wait, no - the symbols are:
        - ✓: correct letter and position
        - -: correct letter, wrong position
        - x: letter not in word
    So:
    - T(✓) in Guess 2 means T is in position 1 and correct.
    - A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 2.
    - X(x) means X is not in the word.
    - I(-) means I is in the word but not in position 4.
    - S(✓) means S is in position 5 and correct.

So now we have:
- Position 1: T (✓)
- Position 5: S (✓)
- Position 3: A (from Guess 1) but Guess 2 says A is not in position 2. Since A was confirmed in position 3 in Guess 1, this is consistent - A is in position 3.
- Letters known to be in the word: T, A, S, I
- Letters known to be absent: L, E, X
- Additional constraints:
  - I is in the word but not in position 4
  - S is in position 5 (already)
  - T is in position 1 (already)

So the word structure is: T _ A _ S

We need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters that are not L, E, X, and must include I (since I is in the word but not in position 4). Therefore I must be in position 2.

So the word is: T I A _ S

Now we need a letter for position 4 that is not L, E, X, and is not already used (T, I, A, S). Common letters left: R, N, D, C, etc.

Possible words: T I A R S (TIARS - not a common word), T I A N S (TIANS - exists), T I A C S (TIACS - not common), T I A D S (TIADS - not common). The most common seems T I A N S.

Let's verify:
- T(✓) position 1
- I in position 2 (allowed, since I is in word but not in position 4)
- A in position 3 (✓ from Guess 1)
- N new letter
- S in position 5 (✓ from Guess 2)

This fits all constraints.Based on the feedback:

1. T is fixed in position 1 (✓)
2. S is fixed in position 5 (✓)
3. A is fixed in position 3 (from Guess 1)
4. I is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
5. Therefore I must be in position 2
6. The word structure is now: T I A _ S

The only common 5-letter word fitting this pattern is TIANS.

So the secret word is now fully determined: T I A _ S, with the only unknown letter in position 4.  
Letters already confirmed: T, I, A, S.  
Letters ruled out so far: L, E, X, N.

The remaining common letters that haven’t been used and fit the pattern are R, C, D, M, etc.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to quickly identify which ones are in the secret word.

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as it includes three vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (S, T, L). This gives a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities quickly.

    - Guess 2: TAXIS → T(✓) A(-) X(x) I(-) S(✓)
    - T is in position 1 (✓)
    - A is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
    - X is not in the word (x)
    - I is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
    - S is in the word but not in position 5 (✓ means correct position? Wait, no - the symbols are:
        - ✓: correct letter and position
        - -: correct letter, wrong position
        - x: letter not in word
    So:
    - T(✓) in Guess 2 means T is in position 1 and correct.
    - A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 2.
    - X(x) means X is not in the word.
    - I(-) means I is in the word but not in position 4.
    - S(✓) means S is in position 5 and correct.

So now we have:
- Position 1: T (✓)
- Position 5: S (✓)
- Position 3: A (from Guess 1) but Guess 2 says A is not in position 2. Since A was confirmed in position 3 in Guess 1, this is consistent - A is in position 3.
- Letters known to be in the word: T, A, S, I
- Letters known to be absent: L, E, X
- Additional constraints:
  - I is in the word but not in position 4
  - S is in position 5 (already)
  - T is in position 1 (already)

So the word structure is: T _ A _ S

We need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters that are not L, E, X, and must include I (since I is in the word but not in position 4). Therefore I must be in position 2.

So the word is: T I A _ S

Now we need a letter for position 4 that is not L, E, X, and is not already used (T, I, A, S). Common letters left: R, N, D, C, etc.

Possible words: T I A R S (TIARS - not a common word), T I A N S (TIANS - exists), T I A C S (TIACS - not common), T I A D S (TIADS - not common). The most common seems T I A N S.

Let's verify:
- T(✓) position 1
- I in position 2 (allowed, since I is in word but not in position 4)
- A in position 3 (✓ from Guess 1)
- N new letter
- S in position 5 (✓ from Guess 2)

This fits all constraints.Based on the feedback:

1. T is fixed in position 1 (✓)
2. S is fixed in position 5 (✓)
3. A is fixed in position 3 (from Guess 1)
4. I is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
5. Therefore I must be in position 2
6. The word structure is now: T I A _ S

The only common 5-letter word fitting this pattern is TIANS.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(x)
Guess 2: TAXIS -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(-) X(x) I(-) S(✓)
Guess 3: TIANS -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) I(✓) A(✓) N(x) S(✓)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on TIANS:

- T(✓) – T is correct in position 1.
- I(✓) – I is correct in position 2.
- A(✓) – A is correct in position 3.
- N(x) – N is not in the word at all.
- S(✓) – S is correct in position 5.

So the secret word is now fully determined: T I A _ S, with the only unknown letter in position 4.  
Letters already confirmed: T, I, A, S.  
Letters ruled out so far: L, E, X, N.

The remaining common letters that haven’t been used and fit the pattern are R, C, D, M, etc.  
The only common 5-letter English word that fits T I A _ S is T I A R S.

<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback from Guess 4 (“TIA RS”) was that the model answer is not five letters. This must have been a formatting or input error, not a real feedback. We still have the exact constraints from the earlier guesses:

- T is fixed in position 1 (✓ from Guess 2 and 3).
- I is fixed in position 2 (✓ from Guess 3).
- A is fixed in position 3 (✓ from Guess 1).
- S is fixed in position 5 (✓ from Guess 2 and 3).
- N is ruled out (x from Guess 3).
- Letters already ruled out: L, E, X, N.

Therefore the word must be T I A _ S, and the only common 5-letter word fitting this pattern is T I A R S. The earlier “TIA RS” guess was likely just a typo (missing the fourth letter), so we can safely proceed with the correct word.
