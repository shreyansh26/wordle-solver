### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that incorporates several of these letters without repeating any, so that we can quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes S, L, A, T, and E - five very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage of possible letters and help narrow down the possibilities significantly regardless of the feedback received.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not in position 1).
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- T is not in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it’s not in position 5).

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ A _ _
- Letters we know are in the word: S, A, E
- Letters we know are NOT in the word: L, T

We need to place S and E in new positions and find two more letters. Since A is fixed in position 3, let’s try to place S and E in positions 2 or 4, and choose two new common letters (like R, N, I, O, etc.) for the remaining blanks.

A good candidate is “RAISE”:
- R is a common letter not yet tested.
- A is confirmed in position 3.
- I is another common letter.
- S is moved to position 4.
- E is moved to position 2.

This tests R, I, and keeps S and E in new positions while keeping A fixed.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From SLATE:
- A is in position 3 (✓)
- S is in the word but not in position 1 (-)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)
- L and T are not in the word (x)

From RAISE:
- A is now marked (-) in position 2, which contradicts the earlier ✓ in position 3. This means the feedback symbols are relative to the secret word, so the A in position 3 is still correct (✓), while the A in position 2 is simply another letter (and not in position 2).  
- R, I are not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-) (so it must be in position 2 or 5)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-) (so it must be in position 1, 2, or 4)

So far:
- Pattern: _ _ A _ _
- Letters known to be in the word: A (pos 3), S, E
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: L, T, R, I
- S must be in position 2 or 5
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 4

Let’s try a word that:
- Keeps A in position 3
- Places S in position 2 (since it can’t be 1 or 4)
- Places E in position 1 (since it can’t be 5)
- Fills the remaining positions with new common letters not yet eliminated

Candidate: E S A _ _ → “ESCAR” (but R is out)  
Next option: E S A _ _ with remaining letters: common unused letters are N, O, U, C, D, etc.

Try “ESCAP” – but P is uncommon.  
Try “ESCAR” – R is out.  
Try “ESCAR” is invalid.  
Try “ESCAR” is invalid.

Better: let’s pick S in position 5 and E in position 2.

Try “NEARS”:
- N, E, A, R, S
- R is out (from RAISE feedback) – invalid.

Try “PEANS” – P is uncommon.  
Try “MEANS” – M is okay, N is okay.  
Check letters: M, E, A, N, S – none are in the eliminated set (L, T, R, I).  
Positions:
- M (1): new
- E (2): allowed (E not in 5, so 2 is okay)
- A (3): correct
