### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that includes common letters and covers a broad range of vowels and consonants. This helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities early.

Common strategic choices for the first guess include words like:
- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This gives us a good chance to identify several letters in the word early on.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position 2 (✓)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so S is somewhere other than position 4
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so E is somewhere other than position 5

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Contains S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively
- Does not contain A or O

To maximize information, we want a word that:
1. Keeps R in position 2
2. Places S and E in new positions
3. Introduces new common letters we haven’t tested yet

Good candidates:
- TRIES (T, I, E in new positions, S moved to 3)
- FRESH (F, E, S in new positions)
- BRISE (B, I, S, E in new positions)

Among these, “TRIES” is strong because:
- T, I are new common letters
- E moves from position 5 to 4
- S moves from position 4 to 3
- R remains in position 2

Current known facts:
1. Pattern: T R _ _ S (positions 1, 2, 5 are locked)
2. Letters we know are in the word: T, R, S, E
3. Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, O, I
4. E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from TRIES feedback: E(-))

So the word must be T R _ _ S with E somewhere in positions 3 or 4.

Possible patterns:
- T R E _ S
- T R _ E S

Common 5-letter words fitting these patterns:
- TREES (but E is in position 4, which is allowed)
- TREND (but D hasn't been tested and we need to test new letters)
- TREKS (but K hasn't been tested)
- TREWS (but W hasn't been tested)

Between these, ""TREWS"" introduces W and S, but S is already confirmed. ""TREES"" is more common and fits perfectly.

Let's check:
- TREES: T(✓), R(✓), E(✓), E(✓), S(✓)
- This would confirm E in position 3 and 4, but we know E is only in the word once. However, ""TREES"" has two E's which might not fit if the secret word has unique letters.

Wait, the feedback only tells us E is in the word but not in position 4. It doesn't say how many times E appears. So ""TREES"" is possible.

But let's think of other words:
- TREWS: T, R, E, W, S
- TREND: T, R, E, N, D

""TREWS"" introduces W and keeps all known letters, while ""TREND"" introduces N and D. Both are valid, but ""TREWS"" seems more likely.

However, ""TREWS"" has W in position 4, which is new. ""TREND"" has N in position 4 and D in position 5, but position 5 is already S. So ""TREND"" is invalid.

Thus, the best next guess is ""TREWS"" to test W in position 4.
