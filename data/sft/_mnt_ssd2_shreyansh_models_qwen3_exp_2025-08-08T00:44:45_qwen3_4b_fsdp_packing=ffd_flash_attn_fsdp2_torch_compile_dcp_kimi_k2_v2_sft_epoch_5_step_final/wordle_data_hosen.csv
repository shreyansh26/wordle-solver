For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Some common starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ARISE
- ADIEU

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help me narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all (x).
- N and E are in the word but in wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains:
- N and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- No C, R, or A.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains N and E.
2. Does not contain C, R, or A.
3. Places N and E in different positions from 4 and 5.

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess should test other common consonants and vowels. Let's try ""STONE"":
- S (common consonant)
- T (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- N (known to be in word, but not in position 4)
- E (known to be in word, but not in position 5)

This places N in position 4 (which is allowed since the original N was in position 4 and marked wrong position) and E in position 5 (which is allowed since the original E was in position 5 and marked wrong position). Wait, actually in CRANE, N was in position 4 and E in position 5, both marked wrong position. So in STONE, N is in position 4 again - that would be bad because we know N is not in position 4.

Let me rethink. The N cannot be in position 4 and E cannot be in position 5. So let's try ""INLET"":
- I (common vowel)
- N (known to be in word, now in position 2)
- L (common consonant)
- E (known to be in word, now in position 4)
- T (common consonant)

This satisfies:
- Contains N and E in new positions (2 and 4).
- Does not contain C, R, or A.
- Tests new letters I, L, T.

This seems like a good second guess.

From the new feedback:

- I(x) – I is not in the word.

- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 4.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word has E in position 4.
- It contains N somewhere, but not in positions 2 or 4 (since 4 is already E).
- It does NOT contain C, R, A, I, L, T.

Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus N and E.

Since E is fixed in position 4, the word structure is: _ _ _ E _

We need to place N in one of positions 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2 or 4).

Let’s try a word that:
- Places N in position 3 (a common middle spot).
- Uses other common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out.
- Tests new letters.

A good candidate is “SOUND”:
- S (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- U (common vowel)
- N (known to be in word, now in position 3)
- D (common consonant)

However, we have no information yet about S, O, U, D. This should help narrow things down.

But wait, let me check if this fits all constraints:
- Contains E in position 4? No, “SOUND” has O in position 3 and U in position 4. So this doesn’t have E in position 4. That’s invalid.

Let me try “BONEY”:
- B (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- N (known to be in word, now in position 3)
- E (fixed in position 4)
- Y (common ending)

This fits perfectly: _ _ _ E _ with N in position 3.

Another candidate is “DONNE”:
- D (common)
- O (common)
- N (known to be in word, now in position 3)
- N (but E must be in position 4, so this has N in position 4 which conflicts with E. So invalid.)

“PONEY”:
- P (common)
- O (common)
- N (known to be in word, now in position 3)
- E (fixed in position 4)
- Y (common)

This also fits.

Between “BONEY” and “PONEY”, both are valid. I’ll go with “PONEY” as it uses P which is slightly less common but still frequent.

But let me think of another: “SPOKE”:
- S (common)
- P (common)
- O (common)
- K (common)
- E (fixed in position 4)

But this has K and no N, which we know must be in the word. So invalid.

“MONEY”:
- M (common)
- O (common)
- N (known to be in word, now in position 3)
- E (fixed in position 4)
- Y (common)

This fits perfectly and uses new letters M, O, Y.

- CRISP
- ARISE
- ADIEU

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help me narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all (x).
- N and E are in the word but in wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains:
- N and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- No C, R, or A.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains N and E.
2. Does not contain C, R, or A.
3. Places N and E in different positions from 4 and 5.

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess should test other common consonants and vowels. Let's try ""STONE"":
- S (common consonant)
- T (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- N (known to be in word, but not in position 4)
- E (known to be in word, but not in position 5)

This places N in position 4 (which is allowed since the original N was in position 4 and marked wrong position) and E in position 5 (which is allowed since the original E was in position 5 and marked wrong position). Wait, actually in CRANE, N was in position 4 and E in position 5, both marked wrong position. So in STONE, N is in position 4 again - that would be bad because we know N is not in position 4.

Let me rethink. The N cannot be in position 4 and E cannot be in position 5. So let's try ""INLET"":
- I (common vowel)
- N (known to be in word, now in position 2)
- L (common consonant)
- E (known to be in word, now in position 4)
- T (common consonant)

This satisfies:
- Contains N and E in new positions (2 and 4).
- Does not contain C, R, or A.
- Tests new letters I, L, T.

This seems like a good second guess.

Guess 2: INLET -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(-) L(x) E(✓) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback:

- I(x) – I is not in the word.
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 2.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 4.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word has E in position 4.
- It contains N somewhere, but not in positions 2 or 4 (since 4 is already E).
- It does NOT contain C, R, A, I, L, T.

Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus N and E.

Since E is fixed in position 4, the word structure is: _ _ _ E _

We need to place N in one of positions 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2 or 4).

Let’s try a word that:
- Places N in position 3 (a common middle spot).
- Uses other common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out.
- Tests new letters.

A good candidate is “SOUND”:
- S (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- U (common vowel)
- N (known to be in word, now in position 3)
- D (common consonant)

However, we have no information yet about S, O, U, D. This should help narrow things down.

But wait, let me check if this fits all constraints:
- Contains E in position 4? No, “SOUND” has O in position 3 and U in position 4. So this doesn’t have E in position 4. That’s invalid.

Let me try “BONEY”:
- B (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- N (known to be in word, now in position 3)
- E (fixed in position 4)
- Y (common ending)

This fits perfectly: _ _ _ E _ with N in position 3.

Another candidate is “DONNE”:
- D (common)
- O (common)
- N (known to be in word, now in position 3)
- N (but E must be in position 4, so this has N in position 4 which conflicts with E. So invalid.)

“PONEY”:
- P (common)
- O (common)
- N (known to be in word, now in position 3)
- E (fixed in position 4)
- Y (common)

This also fits.

Between “BONEY” and “PONEY”, both are valid. I’ll go with “PONEY” as it uses P which is slightly less common but still frequent.

But let me think of another: “SPOKE”:
- S (common)
- P (common)
- O (common)
- K (common)
- E (fixed in position 4)

But this has K and no N, which we know must be in the word. So invalid.

“MONEY”:
- M (common)
- O (common)
- N (known to be in word, now in position 3)
- E (fixed in position 4)
- Y (common)

This fits perfectly and uses new letters M, O, Y.

So “MONEY” seems like a strong third guess.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Some common starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ARISE
- ADIEU

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help me narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback:

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains N and E.

3. Places N and E in different positions from 4 and 5.

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess should test other common consonants and vowels. Let's try ""STONE"":
- S (common consonant)
- T (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- N (known to be in word, but not in position 4)
- E (known to be in word, but not in position 5)

This places N in position 4 (which is allowed since the original N was in position 4 and marked wrong position) and E in position 5 (which is allowed since the original E was in position 5 and marked wrong position). Wait, actually in CRANE, N was in position 4 and E in position 5, both marked wrong position. So in STONE, N is in position 4 again - that would be bad because we know N is not in position 4.

Let me rethink. The N cannot be in position 4 and E cannot be in position 5. So let's try ""INLET"":
- I (common vowel)
- N (known to be in word, now in position 2)
- L (common consonant)
- E (known to be in word, now in position 4)
- T (common consonant)

This satisfies:
- Contains N and E in new positions (2 and 4).

- S(✓) – S is in the word and in position 3.
- E(✓) – E is in position 4 (already known).

- Position 4: E
- Position 5: ?

Letters still allowed (excluding all ruled-out ones): B, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

N must be in position 5 because it cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (positions 2, 3, 4 are fixed as O, S, E respectively, and position 1 is still open but N is ruled out there by the latest feedback).

Thus the word must be: _ O S E N.

Looking at the remaining allowed letters for position 1: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

The most common starting letters among these are B, F, G, H, K, P.

Possible words:

- GOSER – R is ruled out.
- HOSER – R is ruled out.
- KOSER – R is ruled out.
- POSER – R is ruled out.
- VOSER – R is ruled out.

Wait, none of these seem common. Let me check if there are other possibilities.

Actually, looking at the remaining letters, ""HOSER"" is invalid because of R. Let me think of other words that fit _OSE N.

Looking at valid English words:
- BOSER – not a common word.
- FOSER – not a common word.

- ROSER – R is ruled out.
- TOSER – T is ruled out.
- VOSER – not a word.
- WOSER – not a word.
- ZOSER – not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem to be common words. Maybe I missed something.

Wait, let me check if ""HOSER"" is actually a word. It's slang for a person who does something, but it's not a standard word. Similarly, ""KOSER"" is not a word.

Looking back at the allowed letters for position 1: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

""KOSER"" – not a word.

""VOSER"" – not a word.

""ZOSER"" – not a word.

""U"" is allowed, but ""UOSER"" is not a word.

Wait, maybe ""HOSER"" is the intended word here, even if it's slang. Alternatively, maybe ""BOSER"" is acceptable.

But let me think of other possibilities. Maybe ""HOSER"" is the closest.

Alternatively, maybe I made an error in assuming N must be in position 5. Let me re-examine:

From previous feedback:
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (from NOSED feedback, N(-) in position 1, and from MONEY feedback N(-) in position 3, and from INLET feedback N(-) in position 2). So N cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4. The only remaining position is 5.

Therefore, N must be in position 5.

Thus the word is _ O S E N.

Looking at valid English words that fit _OSE N:

- BOSER – not standard.
- FOSER – not standard.
- GOSER – not standard.
- HOSER – slang, but valid in some contexts.
- JOSER – not a word.

- POSER – R is ruled out.
- ROSER – R is ruled out.
- TOSER – T is ruled out.
- VOSER – not a word.
- WOSER – not a word.
- ZOSER – not a word.

The only remaining possible word seems to be ""HOSER"", even if it's slang. However, ""HOSER"" is actually a valid word in some dictionaries as a noun meaning a person who does something. Alternatively, ""BOSER"" is not a word.

Wait, let me check ""KOSER"" – no, not a word.

Looking at ""JOSER"" – no.

""U"" is allowed, but ""UOSER"" is not a word.

Thus, the only possible word left is ""HOSER"".

But let me think again – is there another word I'm missing?

Looking at the allowed letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

The word must be _ O S E N.

Possible combinations:
- B O S E N – ""BOSER"" is not a word, but ""BOSON"" is a word (a type of particle), but it doesn't fit _OSE N.

- F O S E N – ""FOSER"" is not a word.

- W O S E N – ""WOSER"" is not a word.

- X O S E N – ""XOSER"" is not a word.

- Z O S E N – ""ZOSER"" is not a word.

Thus, the only possible word left is ""HOSER"".

But let me check if ""HOSER"" is actually a valid word. According to some dictionaries, ""hoser"" is a valid noun meaning a person who is a bit of a clown or a buffoon. It's also used in some contexts as a slang term.

Given that, ""HOSER"" seems to be the only possible word left that fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is ""HOSER"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Some common starting words include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- CRISP
- ARISE
- ADIEU

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and help me narrow down possibilities quickly.

<guess>CRANE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- C, R, A are not in the word at all (x).
- N and E are in the word but in wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains:
- N and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- No C, R, or A.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains N and E.
2. Does not contain C, R, or A.
3. Places N and E in different positions from 4 and 5.

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess should test other common consonants and vowels. Let's try ""STONE"":
- S (common consonant)
- T (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- N (known to be in word, but not in position 4)
- E (known to be in word, but not in position 5)

This places N in position 4 (which is allowed since the original N was in position 4 and marked wrong position) and E in position 5 (which is allowed since the original E was in position 5 and marked wrong position). Wait, actually in CRANE, N was in position 4 and E in position 5, both marked wrong position. So in STONE, N is in position 4 again - that would be bad because we know N is not in position 4.

Let me rethink. The N cannot be in position 4 and E cannot be in position 5. So let's try ""INLET"":
- I (common vowel)
- N (known to be in word, now in position 2)
- L (common consonant)
- E (known to be in word, now in position 4)
- T (common consonant)

This satisfies:
- Contains N and E in new positions (2 and 4).
- Does not contain C, R, or A.
- Tests new letters I, L, T.

This seems like a good second guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: INLET -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(-) L(x) E(✓) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback:

- I(x) – I is not in the word.
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 2.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 4.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word has E in position 4.
- It contains N somewhere, but not in positions 2 or 4 (since 4 is already E).
- It does NOT contain C, R, A, I, L, T.

Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus N and E.

Since E is fixed in position 4, the word structure is: _ _ _ E _

We need to place N in one of positions 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2 or 4).

Let’s try a word that:
- Places N in position 3 (a common middle spot).
- Uses other common consonants and vowels not yet ruled out.
- Tests new letters.

A good candidate is “SOUND”:
- S (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- U (common vowel)
- N (known to be in word, now in position 3)
- D (common consonant)

However, we have no information yet about S, O, U, D. This should help narrow things down.

But wait, let me check if this fits all constraints:
- Contains E in position 4? No, “SOUND” has O in position 3 and U in position 4. So this doesn’t have E in position 4. That’s invalid.

Let me try “BONEY”:
- B (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- N (known to be in word, now in position 3)
- E (fixed in position 4)
- Y (common ending)

This fits perfectly: _ _ _ E _ with N in position 3.

Another candidate is “DONNE”:
- D (common)
- O (common)
- N (known to be in word, now in position 3)
- N (but E must be in position 4, so this has N in position 4 which conflicts with E. So invalid.)

“PONEY”:
- P (common)
- O (common)
- N (known to be in word, now in position 3)
- E (fixed in position 4)
- Y (common)

This also fits.

Between “BONEY” and “PONEY”, both are valid. I’ll go with “PONEY” as it uses P which is slightly less common but still frequent.

But let me think of another: “SPOKE”:
- S (common)
- P (common)
- O (common)
- K (common)
- E (fixed in position 4)

But this has K and no N, which we know must be in the word. So invalid.

“MONEY”:
- M (common)
- O (common)
- N (known to be in word, now in position 3)
- E (fixed in position 4)
- Y (common)

This fits perfectly and uses new letters M, O, Y.

So “MONEY” seems like a strong third guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: INLET -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(-) L(x) E(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: MONEY -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback:

- M(x) – M is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in position 2.
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 3.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 4.
- Y(x) – Y is not in the word.

So the word structure is now:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: E
- Contains N somewhere, but not in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, I, L, T, M, Y.

Letters still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z.

Since N cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4, it must be in position 1 or 5.

Let’s try placing N in position 1:
- N _ _ E _

We need two more letters (positions 3 and 5) from the allowed set, avoiding any already ruled-out letters.

Possible candidates:
- N _ _ E _ with common letters: N, O, E already fixed.
- Possible middle letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, S, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s try “NOBLE”:
- N (position 1)
- O (position 2) ✓
- B (position 3)
- L (position 4) – but L was ruled out in Guess 2. So invalid.

“NOSED”:
- N (1), O (2), S (3), E (4), D (5)
- All letters are allowed (N, O, S, E, D). No conflicts.

“NOSED” seems valid.

Let me check another: “NOGIE” – but I is ruled out.

“NOVEM” – M is ruled out.

“NOSER” – R is ruled out.

“NOVEX” – X is allowed, but less common.

“NOSED” is the most straightforward and common-sounding word.

Therefore, the next guess is “NOSED”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)

Guess 4: NOSED -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback on NOSED:
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in position 1.
- O(✓) – O is in position 2 (already known).
- S(✓) – S is in the word and in position 3.
- E(✓) – E is in position 4 (already known).
- D(x) – D is not in the word.

So the word structure is now:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: ?

Letters still allowed (excluding all ruled-out ones): B, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

N must be in position 5 because it cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (positions 2, 3, 4 are fixed as O, S, E respectively, and position 1 is still open but N is ruled out there by the latest feedback).

Thus the word must be: _ O S E N.

Looking at the remaining allowed letters for position 1: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

The most common starting letters among these are B, F, G, H, K, P.

Possible words:
- BOSER – but R is ruled out.
- FOSER – R is ruled out.
- GOSER – R is ruled out.
- HOSER – R is ruled out.
- KOSER – R is ruled out.
- POSER – R is ruled out.
- VOSER – R is ruled out.

Wait, none of these seem common. Let me check if there are other possibilities.

Actually, looking at the remaining letters, ""HOSER"" is invalid because of R. Let me think of other words that fit _OSE N.

Looking at valid English words:
- BOSER – not a common word.
- FOSER – not a common word.
- GOSER – not a common word.
- HOSER – not a common word.
- KOSER – not a common word.
- LOSER – L is ruled out.
- MOSER – M is ruled out.
- POSER – R is ruled out.
- ROSER – R is ruled out.
- TOSER – T is ruled out.
- VOSER – not a word.
- WOSER – not a word.
- ZOSER – not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem to be common words. Maybe I missed something.

Wait, let me check if ""HOSER"" is actually a word. It's slang for a person who does something, but it's not a standard word. Similarly, ""KOSER"" is not a word.

Looking back at the allowed letters for position 1: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let me think of ""BOSER"" – not valid.

""JOSER"" – not a word.

""GOSER"" – not a word.

""POSER"" – R is out.

""KOSER"" – not a word.

""VOSER"" – not a word.

""ZOSER"" – not a word.

""U"" is allowed, but ""UOSER"" is not a word.

Wait, maybe ""HOSER"" is the intended word here, even if it's slang. Alternatively, maybe ""BOSER"" is acceptable.

But let me think of other possibilities. Maybe ""HOSER"" is the closest.

Alternatively, maybe I made an error in assuming N must be in position 5. Let me re-examine:

From previous feedback:
- N(-) – N is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (from NOSED feedback, N(-) in position 1, and from MONEY feedback N(-) in position 3, and from INLET feedback N(-) in position 2). So N cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4. The only remaining position is 5.

Therefore, N must be in position 5.

Thus the word is _ O S E N.

Looking at valid English words that fit _OSE N:

- BOSER – not standard.
- FOSER – not standard.
- GOSER – not standard.
- HOSER – slang, but valid in some contexts.
- JOSER – not a word.
- LOSER – L is ruled out.
- MOSER – M is ruled out.
- POSER – R is ruled out.
- ROSER – R is ruled out.
- TOSER – T is ruled out.
- VOSER – not a word.
- WOSER – not a word.
- ZOSER – not a word.

The only remaining possible word seems to be ""HOSER"", even if it's slang. However, ""HOSER"" is actually a valid word in some dictionaries as a noun meaning a person who does something. Alternatively, ""BOSER"" is not a word.

Wait, let me check ""KOSER"" – no, not a word.

Looking at ""JOSER"" – no.

""U"" is allowed, but ""UOSER"" is not a word.

Thus, the only possible word left is ""HOSER"".

But let me think again – is there another word I'm missing?

Looking at the allowed letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

The word must be _ O S E N.

Possible combinations:
- B O S E N – ""BOSER"" is not a word, but ""BOSON"" is a word (a type of particle), but it doesn't fit _OSE N.

- F O S E N – ""FOSER"" is not a word.

- G O S E N – ""GOSER"" is not a word.

- H O S E N – ""HOSER"" is slang but valid.

- J O S E N – ""JOSER"" is not a word.

- K O S E N – ""KOSER"" is not a word.

- P O S E N – ""POSER"" is invalid (R).

- Q O S E N – ""QOSER"" is not a word.

- U O S E N – ""UOSER"" is not a word.

- V O S E N – ""VOSER"" is not a word.

- W O S E N – ""WOSER"" is not a word.

- X O S E N – ""XOSER"" is not a word.

- Z O S E N – ""ZOSER"" is not a word.

Thus, the only possible word left is ""HOSER"".

But let me check if ""HOSER"" is actually a valid word. According to some dictionaries, ""hoser"" is a valid noun meaning a person who is a bit of a clown or a buffoon. It's also used in some contexts as a slang term.

Given that, ""HOSER"" seems to be the only possible word left that fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is ""HOSER"".

- N is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (from NOSED and MONEY feedback). The only remaining position is 5, so N must be in position 5.

Therefore, the secret word is H O S E N.
