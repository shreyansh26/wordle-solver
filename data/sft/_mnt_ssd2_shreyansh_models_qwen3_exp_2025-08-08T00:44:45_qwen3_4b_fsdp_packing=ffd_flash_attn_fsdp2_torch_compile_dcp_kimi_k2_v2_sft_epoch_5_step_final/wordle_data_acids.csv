### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A: very common vowel
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: the most common vowel in English

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters while avoiding any repeated letters, which helps identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in the first position (✓)
- R, O, E are not in the word at all (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
1. The word starts with A
2. S must appear somewhere in positions 2-5
3. Letters R, O, E are ruled out
4. We still need to test other common vowels (I, U) and consonants (T, N, L, etc.)

A good next guess should:
- Keep A in position 1
- Include S in a new position
- Introduce new common letters
- Avoid R, O, E

A word like ""ASIDE"" would be good, but E is ruled out. ""ABUSE"" also has E. ""ASHES"" has S twice and E. ""ASIDE"" has I and D. ""ASIDE"" is valid but has E which is out. ""ASIST"" isn't valid. ""ASIAN"" has N and I. ""ASIAN"" seems good: A(✓) S(?) I(?) A(?) N(?)

But let's try ""ASHES"" - but E is out. ""ASIDE"" - E is out. ""ASIAN"" seems best.

Wait, ""ASIAN"" has A twice. Maybe better to avoid double letters. ""ASIDE"" has E out. ""ASIST"" invalid. ""ASHES"" invalid. ""ASIAN"" seems the best option with new letters I, N.

But let's think of ""ASIAN"" - A S I A N. It has A twice, but that's okay. However, we know S is in the word but not in position 4 (from AROSE feedback). In AROSE, S was in position 4 (but feedback was ""-""), so S is not in position 4. In ASIAN, S is in position 2 - that's new.

Another option: ""ACIDS"" - but C is less common. ""ASIAN"" seems better.

But let's think of ""ASIAN"" as a good next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word starts with A (position 1 is ✓).
2. S is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (it was “-” in both guesses where it appeared in those spots).
3. I is in the word and is in position 3 (✓).
4. Letters R, O, E, N are ruled out entirely (x in both guesses).
5. The second A in ASIAN was “-”, so the word has only one A and it is fixed in position 1.

So the pattern so far is:
A _ I _ _

We need a 5-letter word that:
- starts with A
- has I in position 3
- contains S somewhere in positions 2 or 5 (since it can’t be 2 or 4)
- uses only letters not yet ruled out: A, I, S, plus any other letters not yet tested (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)

Let’s try to fill positions 2 and 5 with common remaining consonants and see if we can form a valid word.

Possible combinations:
- Position 2: S (but then S would be in position 2, which is allowed since S was only ruled out of positions 2 and 4 in previous guesses - wait, in ASIAN, S was in position 2 and got “-”, so S cannot be in position 2 either. So S must be in position 5.
- Therefore the word must be A _ I _ S with S in position 5.

Now we need a consonant for position 2 and 4. Common consonants not yet ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, etc.

Looking at common 5-letter words fitting A _ I _ S:
- ABIDS – not a word
- ACIDS – valid word (A-C-I-D-S)
- AGIDS – not a word
- ALIAD – not a word
- ALIEN – N is ruled out
- AMISS – has S twice, but S is already known to be present once
- APICS – not a word
- ARTIS – R is ruled out
- ATIDS – not a word
- AVIDS – V is allowed, but “AVIDS” is a valid word (plural of avid)

Between ACIDS and AVIDS:
- ACIDS uses C and D, both common and untested.
- AVIDS uses V, which is less common than C or D.

ACIDS seems better because C and D are more common and we haven’t tested them yet.

So the next guess is ACIDS.
