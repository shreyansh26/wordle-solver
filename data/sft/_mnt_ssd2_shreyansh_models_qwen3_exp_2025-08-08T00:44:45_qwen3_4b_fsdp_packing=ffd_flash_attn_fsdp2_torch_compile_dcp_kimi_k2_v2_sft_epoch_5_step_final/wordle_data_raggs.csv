Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, whether they're in the correct position or just present somewhere else. Another good option might be ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, whether they're in the correct position or just present somewhere else. Another good option might be ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

- I is NOT in the word (x)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we now know:
- Letters in the word and their correct positions: R (1), A (2)
- Letters in the word but wrong positions: S (must be in positions 3, 4, or 5)
- Letters NOT in the word: C, N, E, I, L

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with R and has A as the second letter: RA _ _ _
2. Contains S somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated: R, A, S plus any others not in {C, N, E, I, L}

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s try to place S in position 3: R A S _ _
We need two more letters from the remaining pool. Common choices could be T and O, giving ""RASOT"" (but that's not a valid word). Another common pair is T and D: ""RASDT"" (invalid). Maybe ""RASPY"" – but P and Y are valid.

Wait, let's think of real words. ""RASPY"" is valid. Let's check:
- R A S P Y
- S is in position 3 (new position)
- P and Y are new letters
- No forbidden letters

This seems valid. Alternatively, ""RASPY"" is a good candidate.

Another option: S in position 4: R A _ S _
Possible word: R A B S T – invalid. R A D S T – invalid. R A T S Y – ""RATS Y"" is invalid. R A M S T – invalid. R A P S Y – ""RAPS Y"" is invalid. R A T S Y – invalid. R A D S Y – invalid. R A T S Y – invalid. 

""RASPY"" seems the best valid option here.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, whether they're in the correct position or just present somewhere else. Another good option might be ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- Letters not in the word: C, N, E
- Letters in the word somewhere: R, A (but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively)

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and A
2. Does not contain C, N, or E
3. Places R in a different position than 2
4. Places A in a different position than 3

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5

Let’s try to construct a word:
- R in position 1: R _ _ _ _
- A in position 2: _ A _ _ _
- R in position 3: _ _ R _ _
- A in position 4: _ _ _ A _
- R in position 5: _ _ _ _ R

We need two more distinct letters (not C, N, E). Common remaining letters include S, T, L, I, O, D, U, etc.

Let’s try ""RAILS"":
- R in position 1 (new position)
- A in position 2 (new position)
- I, L, S are new letters
- Contains no C, N, E
- All letters are valid

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, whether they're in the correct position or just present somewhere else. Another good option might be ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but I'll go with ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- N is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- Letters not in the word: C, N, E
- Letters in the word somewhere: R, A (but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively)

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and A
2. Does not contain C, N, or E
3. Places R in a different position than 2
4. Places A in a different position than 3

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5

Let’s try to construct a word:
- R in position 1: R _ _ _ _
- A in position 2: _ A _ _ _
- R in position 3: _ _ R _ _
- A in position 4: _ _ _ A _
- R in position 5: _ _ _ _ R

We need two more distinct letters (not C, N, E). Common remaining letters include S, T, L, I, O, D, U, etc.

Let’s try ""RAILS"":
- R in position 1 (new position)
- A in position 2 (new position)
- I, L, S are new letters
- Contains no C, N, E
- All letters are valid

This seems like a strong second guess.

- A is in the correct position (2nd letter) ✓
- I is NOT in the word (x)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we now know:
- Letters in the word and their correct positions: R (1), A (2)
- Letters in the word but wrong positions: S (must be in positions 3, 4, or 5)
- Letters NOT in the word: C, N, E, I, L

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with R and has A as the second letter: RA _ _ _
2. Contains S somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated: R, A, S plus any others not in {C, N, E, I, L}

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s try to place S in position 3: R A S _ _
We need two more letters from the remaining pool. Common choices could be T and O, giving ""RASOT"" (but that's not a valid word). Another common pair is T and D: ""RASDT"" (invalid). Maybe ""RASPY"" – but P and Y are valid.

Wait, let's think of real words. ""RASPY"" is valid. Let's check:
- R A S P Y
- S is in position 3 (new position)
- P and Y are new letters
- No forbidden letters

This seems valid. Alternatively, ""RASPY"" is a good candidate.

Another option: S in position 4: R A _ S _

- A (✓) – correct in position 2
- S (-) – in the word but NOT in position 3
- P (x) – not in the word
- Y (x) – not in the word

- Forbidden letters: C, N, E, I, L, P, Y
- Remaining usable letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with “RA”, contains S in position 4 or 5, and uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try S in position 4: R A _ S _
We need one more letter for position 3. Common letters left: B, D, T, M, etc.
- R A B S T → “RABST” – invalid
- R A D S T → “RADS T” – invalid
- R A T S Y → Y is forbidden
- R A M S T → “RAMS T” – invalid
- R A T S _ → “RATS _” – but we already have S in 4, so “RATS_” would need a 5th letter, but we have only 4 slots filled. Actually, with S in 4, the word is R A _ S _, so position 3 must be filled.

Looking for real words:
- R A B S T – invalid
- R A D S T – invalid
- R A T S T – invalid
- R A M S T – invalid
- R A T S Y – invalid
- R A T S H – “RATHS” – valid word (plural of rath, though rare, it’s valid)

- R A T S H – “RATHS” is valid, let’s check:
  - R A T H S – positions: 1 R, 2 A, 3 T, 4 H, 5 S
  - S is in position 5 (allowed, since S cannot be in 3)
  - All letters are allowed
  - Valid word

Another option: S in position 5: R A _ _ S
We need two more letters for positions 3 and 4.
- R A T T S – invalid
- R A T O S – “RATOS” – invalid
- R A T U S – invalid
- R A T I S – I is forbidden
- R A T E S – E is forbidden
- R A T D S – invalid
