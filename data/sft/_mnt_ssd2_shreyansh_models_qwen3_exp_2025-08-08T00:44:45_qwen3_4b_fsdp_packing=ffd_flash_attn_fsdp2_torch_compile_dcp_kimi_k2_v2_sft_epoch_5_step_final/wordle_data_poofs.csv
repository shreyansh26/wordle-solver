For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Some of the most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A word that uses several of these letters is ""AROSE"". It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage to start eliminating or confirming letters.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly more balanced with vowels and consonants. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in the third position.
- It contains S, but S is not in position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining common vowels are I and U, and common consonants left include T, L, N, C, D, M, P, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep O in position 3.
2. Include S somewhere other than position 4.
3. Use new letters we haven’t tested yet.

Possible candidates:
- ""POINT"" – but O is already fixed in position 3, so this would have O in position 1, which is wrong.
- ""SOUND"" – S in position 1, O in position 2, but we know O must be in position 3.
- ""STONY"" – S in position 1, O in position 2 (wrong).
- ""SLOTH"" – S in position 1, O in position 2 (wrong).
- ""SPOUT"" – S in position 1, O in position 2 (wrong).
- ""CLOUD"" – O in position 3, but no S.
- ""SWORD"" – S in position 1, O in position 2 (wrong).
- ""SLOTH"" – same issue.
- ""SLOTH"" – same issue.

Wait, let's think differently. We need O in position 3. So the word looks like: _ _ O _ _

We know S is in the word but not in position 4. So S could be in positions 1, 2, or 5.

Let's try ""SPOUT"":
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- P, U, T are new letters.
- O in position 3 (correct).
- But U is a vowel we haven't tested yet.

But we have to make sure S is not in position 4, which it isn't here.

Another option: ""SLOTH"" – but O is in position 2, which is wrong.

""STOIC"" – but O is in position 3 (correct), S in position 1 (allowed), T, I, C new letters.

""STOIC"" seems good: S T O I C
- O in position 3 (✓)
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- T, I, C are new letters to test.

This seems like a strong second guess.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - O is fixed in position 3.
   - S is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - A, R, E are out.

2. STOIC → S(-) T(x) O(✓) I(x) C(x)
   - Confirms O is still in position 3.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (because the first letter got “-”).
   - T, I, C are out.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Letters present: S (not in positions 1 or 4)
- Letters absent: A, R, E, T, I, C
- Remaining common letters to test: N, L, D, M, P, U, Y, etc.

S must be in position 2 or 5.

Let’s try S in position 2: _ S O _ _
We need two more letters that haven’t been ruled out. Good candidates: N, L, D, M, P, U, Y.

A common word fitting _ S O _ _ is “SPOON”, but O is already fixed in position 3, so that doesn’t work.

Another word: “SONIC” – but C is out.
“SOUND” – D and U are still possible.

Let’s try “SOUND”:
- S in position 1 (but feedback already said S is NOT in position 1). So this is invalid.

Next: S in position 5: _ _ O _ S
A common word: “BONDS” – but D and N are still possible.

Wait, let’s list possible patterns:
- S must be in position 2 or 5.

Option 1: _ S O _ _
Possible words: “SPOON” (invalid), “SNOWS” (invalid), “SLOSH” (L, H not tested), “SPONS” (invalid).

Option 2: _ _ O _ S
Possible words: “BONDS”, “CONES” (E out), “DONUT” (T out), “GONOS” (invalid), “HONKS” (K not tested), “MOSHS” (invalid), “PONDS”, “SONGS” (G not tested), “WONKY” (Y not tested).

“PONDS” seems valid:
- P, N, D are new letters.
- Pattern: P O N D S – but O must be in position 3, so this is P O N D S, which would have O in position 2 (invalid).

Wait, correct pattern is _ _ O _ _ for position 3.

Let’s try S in position 2: _ S O _ _
Possible word: “SLOSH” – but S is in position 1 here, not 2.

Actually, for _ S O _ _, we need:
- Position 1: any unused letter (not A, R, E, T, I, C)
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: any unused letter (not A, R, E, T, I, C)
- Position 5: any unused letter (not A, R, E, T, I, C)

A valid word: “SPOON” – invalid (O in position 2).
“SNOBS” – invalid (length 5, but S in position 1).
“SLOSH” – S in position 1.
“SNOWS” – S in position 1.
“SPONS” – invalid.
“SWOON” – S in position 1.

Hmm, seems hard to find a common word with S in position 2. Let’s try S in position 5: _ _ O _ S.

Possible word: “BONDS” – but O must be in position 3, so B O N D S – O is in position 2 (invalid).

Wait, correct pattern is _ _ O _ _ with O in position 3.

Let’s try S in position 2: _ S O _ _
Possible word: “SLOSH” – but S is in position 1 here.

Actually, the word must be _ S O _ _. Let’s think of real words:
- “SPOON” – invalid (O in position 2).
- “SLOSH” – S in position 1.
- “SNOWS” – S in position 1.
- “SPONS” – invalid.
- “SLOBS” – S in position 1.

It seems difficult to find a common word with S in position 2. Maybe S is in position 5.

For _ _ O _ S:
Possible word: “GONOS” – invalid.
“HONKS” – H, N, K, S.
“MOSHS” – invalid.
“PONDS” – P, O, N, D, S – but O is in position 3, so P O N D S – O is in position 2 (invalid).
“WONKY” – W, O, N, K, Y – O is in position 2 (invalid).

Wait, let’s list possible words with O in position 3:
- _ _ O _ _
Possible words:
- BONUS – B, U, N, S.
- CLOUD – C, L, O, U, D – but C, L, D are new.
- DUNGS – D, U, N, G, S.

- RONDS – R is out.
- SLOTH – S in position 1.
- TONIC – T is out.
- VONDS – V, O, N, D, S – O in position 2 (invalid).
- WONKY – W, O, N, K, Y – O in position 2 (invalid).

It seems the only valid words with O in position 3 and S not in positions 1 or 4 are:
- BONUS – S in position 5.
- DUNGS – S in position 5.
- LUNGS – S in position 5.
- MUNDS – S in position 5.

Let’s pick “BONUS”:
- B, U, N are new letters.
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- O is in position 3 (correct).

This seems like the best next guess.
</think>

Based on the feedback, O is locked in position 3, S must be in position 5 (since it can’t be in 1 or 4), and we need to test new letters B, U, N.

<guess>BONUS</guess>",BONUS,"From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - O is fixed in position 3.
   - S is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - A, R, E are out.

2. STOIC → S(-) T(x) O(✓) I(x) C(x)
   - Confirms O is still in position 3.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (because the first letter got “-”).
   - T, I, C are out.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Letters present: S (not in positions 1 or 4)
- Letters absent: A, R, E, T, I, C
- Remaining common letters to test: N, L, D, M, P, U, Y, etc.

S must be in position 2 or 5.

Let’s try S in position 2: _ S O _ _
We need two more letters that haven’t been ruled out. Good candidates: N, L, D, M, P, U, Y.

A common word fitting _ S O _ _ is “SPOON”, but O is already fixed in position 3, so that doesn’t work.

Another word: “SONIC” – but C is out.

“PONDS” seems valid:
- P, N, D are new letters.

Possible word: “SLOSH” – but S is in position 1 here, not 2.

- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Some of the most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A word that uses several of these letters is ""AROSE"". It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage to start eliminating or confirming letters.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly more balanced with vowels and consonants. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in the third position.
- It contains S, but S is not in position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining common vowels are I and U, and common consonants left include T, L, N, C, D, M, P, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep O in position 3.
2. Include S somewhere other than position 4.
3. Use new letters we haven’t tested yet.

Possible candidates:
- ""POINT"" – but O is already fixed in position 3, so this would have O in position 1, which is wrong.
- ""SOUND"" – S in position 1, O in position 2, but we know O must be in position 3.
- ""STONY"" – S in position 1, O in position 2 (wrong).
- ""SLOTH"" – S in position 1, O in position 2 (wrong).
- ""SPOUT"" – S in position 1, O in position 2 (wrong).
- ""CLOUD"" – O in position 3, but no S.
- ""SWORD"" – S in position 1, O in position 2 (wrong).
- ""SLOTH"" – same issue.
- ""SLOTH"" – same issue.

Wait, let's think differently. We need O in position 3. So the word looks like: _ _ O _ _

We know S is in the word but not in position 4. So S could be in positions 1, 2, or 5.

Let's try ""SPOUT"":
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- P, U, T are new letters.
- O in position 3 (correct).
- But U is a vowel we haven't tested yet.

But we have to make sure S is not in position 4, which it isn't here.

Another option: ""SLOTH"" – but O is in position 2, which is wrong.

""STOIC"" – but O is in position 3 (correct), S in position 1 (allowed), T, I, C new letters.

""STOIC"" seems good: S T O I C
- O in position 3 (✓)
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- T, I, C are new letters to test.

This seems like a strong second guess.Based on the feedback, we know:
- O is in the word and in position 3.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- A, R, E are not in the word.

I'll try ""STOIC"" to test new letters while keeping O in position 3 and placing S in position 1.

<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - O is fixed in position 3.
   - S is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - A, R, E are out.

2. STOIC → S(-) T(x) O(✓) I(x) C(x)
   - Confirms O is still in position 3.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (because the first letter got “-”).
   - T, I, C are out.

So far we know:

- Letters present: S (not in positions 1 or 4)
- Letters absent: A, R, E, T, I, C
- Remaining common letters to test: N, L, D, M, P, U, Y, etc.

S must be in position 2 or 5.

Let’s try S in position 2: _ S O _ _
We need two more letters that haven’t been ruled out. Good candidates: N, L, D, M, P, U, Y.

A common word fitting _ S O _ _ is “SPOON”, but O is already fixed in position 3, so that doesn’t work.

Another word: “SONIC” – but C is out.
“SOUND” – D and U are still possible.

Let’s try “SOUND”:
- S in position 1 (but feedback already said S is NOT in position 1). So this is invalid.

Next: S in position 5: _ _ O _ S
A common word: “BONDS” – but D and N are still possible.

Wait, let’s list possible patterns:
- S must be in position 2 or 5.

Option 1: _ S O _ _
Possible words: “SPOON” (invalid), “SNOWS” (invalid), “SLOSH” (L, H not tested), “SPONS” (invalid).

Option 2: _ _ O _ S
Possible words: “BONDS”, “CONES” (E out), “DONUT” (T out), “GONOS” (invalid), “HONKS” (K not tested), “MOSHS” (invalid), “PONDS”, “SONGS” (G not tested), “WONKY” (Y not tested).

“PONDS” seems valid:
- P, N, D are new letters.
- Pattern: P O N D S – but O must be in position 3, so this is P O N D S, which would have O in position 2 (invalid).

Wait, correct pattern is _ _ O _ _ for position 3.

Let’s try S in position 2: _ S O _ _
Possible word: “SLOSH” – but S is in position 1 here, not 2.

Actually, for _ S O _ _, we need:
- Position 1: any unused letter (not A, R, E, T, I, C)
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: any unused letter (not A, R, E, T, I, C)
- Position 5: any unused letter (not A, R, E, T, I, C)

A valid word: “SPOON” – invalid (O in position 2).
“SNOBS” – invalid (length 5, but S in position 1).
“SLOSH” – S in position 1.
“SNOWS” – S in position 1.
“SPONS” – invalid.
“SWOON” – S in position 1.

Hmm, seems hard to find a common word with S in position 2. Let’s try S in position 5: _ _ O _ S.

Possible word: “BONDS” – but O must be in position 3, so B O N D S – O is in position 2 (invalid).

Wait, correct pattern is _ _ O _ _ with O in position 3.

Let’s try S in position 2: _ S O _ _
Possible word: “SLOSH” – but S is in position 1 here.

Actually, the word must be _ S O _ _. Let’s think of real words:
- “SPOON” – invalid (O in position 2).
- “SLOSH” – S in position 1.
- “SNOWS” – S in position 1.
- “SPONS” – invalid.
- “SLOBS” – S in position 1.

It seems difficult to find a common word with S in position 2. Maybe S is in position 5.

For _ _ O _ S:
Possible word: “GONOS” – invalid.
“HONKS” – H, N, K, S.
“MOSHS” – invalid.
“PONDS” – P, O, N, D, S – but O is in position 3, so P O N D S – O is in position 2 (invalid).
“WONKY” – W, O, N, K, Y – O is in position 2 (invalid).

Wait, let’s list possible words with O in position 3:
- _ _ O _ _
Possible words:
- BONUS – B, U, N, S.
- CLOUD – C, L, O, U, D – but C, L, D are new.
- DUNGS – D, U, N, G, S.
- GONIF – G, O, N, I, F – I is out.
- HONKS – H, O, N, K, S – O in position 2 (invalid).
- LUNGS – L, U, N, G, S.
- MUNDS – M, U, N, D, S.
- PONDS – P, O, N, D, S – O in position 2 (invalid).
- RONDS – R is out.

- TONIC – T is out.
- VONDS – V, O, N, D, S – O in position 2 (invalid).
- WONKY – W, O, N, K, Y – O in position 2 (invalid).

It seems the only valid words with O in position 3 and S not in positions 1 or 4 are:
- BONUS – S in position 5.
- DUNGS – S in position 5.
- LUNGS – S in position 5.
- MUNDS – S in position 5.

Let’s pick “BONUS”:
- B, U, N are new letters.
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- O is in position 3 (correct).

This seems like the best next guess.Based on the feedback, O is locked in position 3, S must be in position 5 (since it can’t be in 1 or 4), and we need to test new letters B, U, N.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Some of the most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A word that uses several of these letters is ""AROSE"". It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage to start eliminating or confirming letters.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly more balanced with vowels and consonants. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in the third position.
- It contains S, but S is not in position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining common vowels are I and U, and common consonants left include T, L, N, C, D, M, P, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep O in position 3.
2. Include S somewhere other than position 4.
3. Use new letters we haven’t tested yet.

Possible candidates:
- ""POINT"" – but O is already fixed in position 3, so this would have O in position 1, which is wrong.
- ""SOUND"" – S in position 1, O in position 2, but we know O must be in position 3.
- ""STONY"" – S in position 1, O in position 2 (wrong).
- ""SLOTH"" – S in position 1, O in position 2 (wrong).
- ""SPOUT"" – S in position 1, O in position 2 (wrong).
- ""CLOUD"" – O in position 3, but no S.
- ""SWORD"" – S in position 1, O in position 2 (wrong).
- ""SLOTH"" – same issue.
- ""SLOTH"" – same issue.

Wait, let's think differently. We need O in position 3. So the word looks like: _ _ O _ _

We know S is in the word but not in position 4. So S could be in positions 1, 2, or 5.

Let's try ""SPOUT"":
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- P, U, T are new letters.
- O in position 3 (correct).
- But U is a vowel we haven't tested yet.

But we have to make sure S is not in position 4, which it isn't here.

Another option: ""SLOTH"" – but O is in position 2, which is wrong.

""STOIC"" – but O is in position 3 (correct), S in position 1 (allowed), T, I, C new letters.

""STOIC"" seems good: S T O I C
- O in position 3 (✓)
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- T, I, C are new letters to test.

This seems like a strong second guess.Based on the feedback, we know:
- O is in the word and in position 3.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- A, R, E are not in the word.

I'll try ""STOIC"" to test new letters while keeping O in position 3 and placing S in position 1.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STOIC -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(✓) I(x) C(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - O is fixed in position 3.
   - S is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - A, R, E are out.

2. STOIC → S(-) T(x) O(✓) I(x) C(x)
   - Confirms O is still in position 3.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (because the first letter got “-”).
   - T, I, C are out.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Letters present: S (not in positions 1 or 4)
- Letters absent: A, R, E, T, I, C
- Remaining common letters to test: N, L, D, M, P, U, Y, etc.

S must be in position 2 or 5.

Let’s try S in position 2: _ S O _ _
We need two more letters that haven’t been ruled out. Good candidates: N, L, D, M, P, U, Y.

A common word fitting _ S O _ _ is “SPOON”, but O is already fixed in position 3, so that doesn’t work.

Another word: “SONIC” – but C is out.
“SOUND” – D and U are still possible.

Let’s try “SOUND”:
- S in position 1 (but feedback already said S is NOT in position 1). So this is invalid.

Next: S in position 5: _ _ O _ S
A common word: “BONDS” – but D and N are still possible.

Wait, let’s list possible patterns:
- S must be in position 2 or 5.

Option 1: _ S O _ _
Possible words: “SPOON” (invalid), “SNOWS” (invalid), “SLOSH” (L, H not tested), “SPONS” (invalid).

Option 2: _ _ O _ S
Possible words: “BONDS”, “CONES” (E out), “DONUT” (T out), “GONOS” (invalid), “HONKS” (K not tested), “MOSHS” (invalid), “PONDS”, “SONGS” (G not tested), “WONKY” (Y not tested).

“PONDS” seems valid:
- P, N, D are new letters.
- Pattern: P O N D S – but O must be in position 3, so this is P O N D S, which would have O in position 2 (invalid).

Wait, correct pattern is _ _ O _ _ for position 3.

Let’s try S in position 2: _ S O _ _
Possible word: “SLOSH” – but S is in position 1 here, not 2.

Actually, for _ S O _ _, we need:
- Position 1: any unused letter (not A, R, E, T, I, C)
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: any unused letter (not A, R, E, T, I, C)
- Position 5: any unused letter (not A, R, E, T, I, C)

A valid word: “SPOON” – invalid (O in position 2).
“SNOBS” – invalid (length 5, but S in position 1).
“SLOSH” – S in position 1.
“SNOWS” – S in position 1.
“SPONS” – invalid.
“SWOON” – S in position 1.

Hmm, seems hard to find a common word with S in position 2. Let’s try S in position 5: _ _ O _ S.

Possible word: “BONDS” – but O must be in position 3, so B O N D S – O is in position 2 (invalid).

Wait, correct pattern is _ _ O _ _ with O in position 3.

Let’s try S in position 2: _ S O _ _
Possible word: “SLOSH” – but S is in position 1 here.

Actually, the word must be _ S O _ _. Let’s think of real words:
- “SPOON” – invalid (O in position 2).
- “SLOSH” – S in position 1.
- “SNOWS” – S in position 1.
- “SPONS” – invalid.
- “SLOBS” – S in position 1.

It seems difficult to find a common word with S in position 2. Maybe S is in position 5.

For _ _ O _ S:
Possible word: “GONOS” – invalid.
“HONKS” – H, N, K, S.
“MOSHS” – invalid.
“PONDS” – P, O, N, D, S – but O is in position 3, so P O N D S – O is in position 2 (invalid).
“WONKY” – W, O, N, K, Y – O is in position 2 (invalid).

Wait, let’s list possible words with O in position 3:
- _ _ O _ _
Possible words:
- BONUS – B, U, N, S.
- CLOUD – C, L, O, U, D – but C, L, D are new.
- DUNGS – D, U, N, G, S.
- GONIF – G, O, N, I, F – I is out.
- HONKS – H, O, N, K, S – O in position 2 (invalid).
- LUNGS – L, U, N, G, S.
- MUNDS – M, U, N, D, S.
- PONDS – P, O, N, D, S – O in position 2 (invalid).
- RONDS – R is out.
- SLOTH – S in position 1.
- TONIC – T is out.
- VONDS – V, O, N, D, S – O in position 2 (invalid).
- WONKY – W, O, N, K, Y – O in position 2 (invalid).

It seems the only valid words with O in position 3 and S not in positions 1 or 4 are:
- BONUS – S in position 5.
- DUNGS – S in position 5.
- LUNGS – S in position 5.
- MUNDS – S in position 5.

Let’s pick “BONUS”:
- B, U, N are new letters.
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- O is in position 3 (correct).

This seems like the best next guess.Based on the feedback, O is locked in position 3, S must be in position 5 (since it can’t be in 1 or 4), and we need to test new letters B, U, N.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Some of the most common letters in English are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A word that uses several of these letters is ""AROSE"". It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This should give us good coverage to start eliminating or confirming letters.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly more balanced with vowels and consonants. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:

- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in the third position.
- It contains S, but S is not in position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or E.

We still need to test other common consonants and vowels. The remaining common vowels are I and U, and common consonants left include T, L, N, C, D, M, P, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep O in position 3.
2. Include S somewhere other than position 4.
3. Use new letters we haven’t tested yet.

Possible candidates:
- ""POINT"" – but O is already fixed in position 3, so this would have O in position 1, which is wrong.
- ""SOUND"" – S in position 1, O in position 2, but we know O must be in position 3.
- ""STONY"" – S in position 1, O in position 2 (wrong).
- ""SLOTH"" – S in position 1, O in position 2 (wrong).
- ""SPOUT"" – S in position 1, O in position 2 (wrong).
- ""CLOUD"" – O in position 3, but no S.
- ""SWORD"" – S in position 1, O in position 2 (wrong).
- ""SLOTH"" – same issue.
- ""SLOTH"" – same issue.

Wait, let's think differently. We need O in position 3. So the word looks like: _ _ O _ _

We know S is in the word but not in position 4. So S could be in positions 1, 2, or 5.

Let's try ""SPOUT"":
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- P, U, T are new letters.
- O in position 3 (correct).
- But U is a vowel we haven't tested yet.

But we have to make sure S is not in position 4, which it isn't here.

Another option: ""SLOTH"" – but O is in position 2, which is wrong.

""STOIC"" – but O is in position 3 (correct), S in position 1 (allowed), T, I, C new letters.

""STOIC"" seems good: S T O I C
- O in position 3 (✓)
- S in position 1 (allowed)
- T, I, C are new letters to test.

This seems like a strong second guess.Based on the feedback, we know:
- O is in the word and in position 3.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- A, R, E are not in the word.

I'll try ""STOIC"" to test new letters while keeping O in position 3 and placing S in position 1.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STOIC -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(✓) I(x) C(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - O is fixed in position 3.
   - S is somewhere in the word but NOT in position 4.
   - A, R, E are out.

2. STOIC → S(-) T(x) O(✓) I(x) C(x)
   - Confirms O is still in position 3.
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (because the first letter got “-”).
   - T, I, C are out.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Letters present: S (not in positions 1 or 4)
- Letters absent: A, R, E, T, I, C
- Remaining common letters to test: N, L, D, M, P, U, Y, etc.

S must be in position 2 or 5.

Let’s try S in position 2: _ S O _ _
We need two more letters that haven’t been ruled out. Good candidates: N, L, D, M, P, U, Y.

A common word fitting _ S O _ _ is “SPOON”, but O is already fixed in position 3, so that doesn’t work.

Another word: “SONIC” – but C is out.
“SOUND” – D and U are still possible.

Let’s try “SOUND”:
- S in position 1 (but feedback already said S is NOT in position 1). So this is invalid.

Next: S in position 5: _ _ O _ S
A common word: “BONDS” – but D and N are still possible.

Wait, let’s list possible patterns:
- S must be in position 2 or 5.

Option 1: _ S O _ _
Possible words: “SPOON” (invalid), “SNOWS” (invalid), “SLOSH” (L, H not tested), “SPONS” (invalid).

Option 2: _ _ O _ S
Possible words: “BONDS”, “CONES” (E out), “DONUT” (T out), “GONOS” (invalid), “HONKS” (K not tested), “MOSHS” (invalid), “PONDS”, “SONGS” (G not tested), “WONKY” (Y not tested).

“PONDS” seems valid:
- P, N, D are new letters.
- Pattern: P O N D S – but O must be in position 3, so this is P O N D S, which would have O in position 2 (invalid).

Wait, correct pattern is _ _ O _ _ for position 3.

Let’s try S in position 2: _ S O _ _
Possible word: “SLOSH” – but S is in position 1 here, not 2.

Actually, for _ S O _ _, we need:
- Position 1: any unused letter (not A, R, E, T, I, C)
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: any unused letter (not A, R, E, T, I, C)
- Position 5: any unused letter (not A, R, E, T, I, C)

A valid word: “SPOON” – invalid (O in position 2).
“SNOBS” – invalid (length 5, but S in position 1).
“SLOSH” – S in position 1.
“SNOWS” – S in position 1.
“SPONS” – invalid.
“SWOON” – S in position 1.

Hmm, seems hard to find a common word with S in position 2. Let’s try S in position 5: _ _ O _ S.

Possible word: “BONDS” – but O must be in position 3, so B O N D S – O is in position 2 (invalid).

Wait, correct pattern is _ _ O _ _ with O in position 3.

Let’s try S in position 2: _ S O _ _
Possible word: “SLOSH” – but S is in position 1 here.

Actually, the word must be _ S O _ _. Let’s think of real words:
- “SPOON” – invalid (O in position 2).
- “SLOSH” – S in position 1.
- “SNOWS” – S in position 1.
- “SPONS” – invalid.
- “SLOBS” – S in position 1.

It seems difficult to find a common word with S in position 2. Maybe S is in position 5.

For _ _ O _ S:
Possible word: “GONOS” – invalid.
“HONKS” – H, N, K, S.
“MOSHS” – invalid.
“PONDS” – P, O, N, D, S – but O is in position 3, so P O N D S – O is in position 2 (invalid).
“WONKY” – W, O, N, K, Y – O is in position 2 (invalid).

Wait, let’s list possible words with O in position 3:
- _ _ O _ _
Possible words:
- BONUS – B, U, N, S.
- CLOUD – C, L, O, U, D – but C, L, D are new.
- DUNGS – D, U, N, G, S.
- GONIF – G, O, N, I, F – I is out.
- HONKS – H, O, N, K, S – O in position 2 (invalid).
- LUNGS – L, U, N, G, S.
- MUNDS – M, U, N, D, S.
- PONDS – P, O, N, D, S – O in position 2 (invalid).
- RONDS – R is out.
- SLOTH – S in position 1.
- TONIC – T is out.
- VONDS – V, O, N, D, S – O in position 2 (invalid).
- WONKY – W, O, N, K, Y – O in position 2 (invalid).

It seems the only valid words with O in position 3 and S not in positions 1 or 4 are:
- BONUS – S in position 5.
- DUNGS – S in position 5.
- LUNGS – S in position 5.
- MUNDS – S in position 5.

Let’s pick “BONUS”:
- B, U, N are new letters.
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- O is in position 3 (correct).

This seems like the best next guess.Based on the feedback, O is locked in position 3, S must be in position 5 (since it can’t be in 1 or 4), and we need to test new letters B, U, N.

A common word is “DOLLS” – but L is repeated and we have no info on L yet. Also, L would be in position 4, which is allowed.

Another is “GOLDS” – G, O, L, D, S. All letters are still possible.

“GOLDS” seems like a good choice because it tests G, L, D in the remaining positions.

Let’s go with “GOLDS”.

From all feedback so far:

- Position 3 is O (✓).
- Position 5 is S (✓).
- Letters ruled out: A, R, E, T, I, C, B, N, U, G, L, D.

Current pattern: _ _ O _ S

Remaining common letters to try: M, P, H, Y, K, F, V, W, etc.

We need two letters for positions 1 and 2, and one for position 4, all from the still-possible set.

Possible words fitting _ _ O _ S:
- M, P, H, Y, K, F, V, W, etc.

Looking for common words:
- M, P, H, Y, K, F, V, W

Possible candidates:
- HOMES – H, O, M, E, S – but E is out.
- POMOS – P, O, M, O, S – double O, and M is possible.
- YOKES – Y, O, K, E, S – E is out.
- FOMOS – F, O, M, O, S – double O, but F and M are possible.
- VOMPS – V, O, M, P, S – all letters possible.
- WOKES – W, O, K, E, S – E is out.

""VOMPS"" seems valid, but let's check if any other common words fit.

Another candidate: ""HOMES"" is invalid (E out), ""POMOS"" has double O, ""FOMOS"" has double O, ""VOMPS"" is valid.

But ""VOMPS"" is not a common word. Let's think again.

Looking at remaining letters: M, P, H, Y, K, F, V, W.

Common words:
- HOMES – invalid (E out)
- POMOS – possible
- YOKES – invalid (E out)
- FOMOS – possible
- VOMPS – possible
- WOKES – invalid (E out)
- HOPKS – not a word
- HOMYS – not a word
- POMYS – not a word

Actually, ""POMOS"" is a valid word (plural of pom), but let's see if we can find a more common word.

Another approach: look for _ _ O _ S with remaining letters.

Possible letters for positions 1-2-4: M, P, H, Y, K, F, V, W.

A common word: ""HOMES"" – invalid (E out)
""POMOS"" – valid
""FOMOS"" – valid
""WOMPS"" – W, O, M, P, S – all letters possible (W, M, P not yet ruled out)
""YOKES"" – invalid
""VOMPS"" – valid
""KOMPS"" – K, O, M, P, S – all letters possible

""KOMPS"" is valid (plural of komp, though rare), ""WOMPS"" is more common.

""WOMPS"" seems like the best choice among these.

Let's verify:
- W: not ruled out
- O: in position 3 (correct)
- M: not ruled out
- P: not ruled out
- S: in position 5 (correct)

""WOMPS"" fits all constraints.
