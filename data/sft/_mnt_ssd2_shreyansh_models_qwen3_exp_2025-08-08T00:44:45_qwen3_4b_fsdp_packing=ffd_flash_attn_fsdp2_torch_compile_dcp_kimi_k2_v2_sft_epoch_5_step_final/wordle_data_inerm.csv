For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and letter positions. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters in English (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C) and avoid repeating letters. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give us good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: x → C is NOT in the word at all.
- R: - → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A: x → A is NOT in the word.
- N: - → N is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E: - → E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C or A.
- Contains R, N, E, but R is not in position 2, N is not in position 4, E is not in position 5.

We need to place R, N, E in new positions and introduce new letters that weren’t used (since we only have 6 guesses). Good letters to try next: S, T, I, O, L, U, D, M, P, etc.

A good second guess should:
1. Include R, N, E in new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters.

Possible candidates:
- STERN (but E is in position 5, which is invalid)
- TRINE (E in 5, invalid)
- DRIER (E in 5, invalid)
- PRONE (E in 5, invalid)

Let’s try ""TRIPE"":
- T, I, P are new letters.
- R in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2) → invalid.

""TRINE"" is invalid because E is in position 5.

N: can be in 1 or 2
E: can be in 1, 3, or 4

Let’s try to place N in position 1 (most restrictive spot left for N), then R and E in remaining allowed spots, and fill the last slot with a new common consonant.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

- DRIER (E in 5, invalid)
- PRONE (E in 5, invalid)

Let’s try ""TRIPE"":
- T, I, P are new letters.
- R in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2) → invalid.

""TRINE"" is invalid because E is in position 5.

""RENTS"":
- R in 1, E in 2, N in 3, T in 4, S in 5.
- R is not in position 2 (good).
- E is not in position 5 (good).
- N is not in position 4 (good).
- Introduces T and S (new letters).

This seems valid.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: RENTS -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) N(-) T(x) S(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word at all:
- C, A, T, S (from CRANE and RENTS)

Letters that ARE in the word (but we still don’t know their exact positions):
- R (cannot be in position 1 or 2)
- N (cannot be in position 3 or 4)
- E (cannot be in position 2 or 5)

So the word must contain R, N, E, and must avoid:
- positions 1 for R, 2 for R, 3 for N, 4 for N, 2 for E, 5 for E
- letters C, A, T, S

We still need to test new common letters. Good remaining consonants: D, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc. Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

We want a word that:
- uses R, N, E in allowed positions
- introduces new common letters
- avoids all banned letters and positions

Possible positions for each required letter:
R: can be in 3, 4, or 5
N: can be in 1 or 2
E: can be in 1, 3, or 4

Let’s try to place N in position 1 (most restrictive spot left for N), then R and E in remaining allowed spots, and fill the last slot with a new common consonant.

Candidate: N _ _ _ _
We need R and E somewhere in 2-5, avoiding their forbidden spots.

Let’s try N E R _ _  → but E can’t be in 2 (from RENTS feedback: E(-) in position 2).

Next: N R E _ _  → R in 2 is forbidden (from CRANE feedback: R(-) in position 2).

Next: N _ R E _  → R in 3 is allowed, E in 4 is allowed.

Word so far: N _ R E _

We need one more letter. Good new consonants: D, L, M, P, B, etc.

Let’s try N I R E D → but D is new, I is new vowel, R in 3, E in 4.

Check positions:
- R in 3 (allowed)
- N in 1 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- I and D are new

This seems valid.

Let’s tabulate everything we now know.

Letters NOT in the word at all:
- C, A, T, S, D

Letters that ARE in the word (but we still don’t know their exact positions):
- R (cannot be in 1, 2, 3)
- N (cannot be in 1, 3, 4)
- E (cannot be in 2, 5)

So:
- R must be in position 4 or 5
- N must be in position 2
- E must be in position 1, 3, or 4

We still need to test new common letters. Good remaining consonants: L, M, P, B, G, H, K, F, etc. Good remaining vowels: O, U.

We want a word that:
1. Uses N in position 2
2. Uses R in position 4 or 5
3. Uses E in position 1, 3, or 4 (but must avoid conflicts)
4. Introduces new common letters in the remaining slots

Let’s try to place N in 2, R in 4, and E in 1 or 3.

Option 1: E _ N R _
   - E in 1, N in 3 (but N cannot be in 3) → invalid

Option 2: E _ N _ R
   - E in 1, N in 3 (invalid) → no

Option 3: _ N E R _
   - N in 2, E in 3, R in 4
   - Need two new letters for positions 1 and 5
   - Good candidates: L, M, P, B, etc.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and letter positions. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters in English (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C) and avoid repeating letters. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: x → C is NOT in the word at all.
- R: - → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A: x → A is NOT in the word.
- N: - → N is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E: - → E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C or A.
- Contains R, N, E, but R is not in position 2, N is not in position 4, E is not in position 5.

We need to place R, N, E in new positions and introduce new letters that weren’t used (since we only have 6 guesses). Good letters to try next: S, T, I, O, L, U, D, M, P, etc.

A good second guess should:
1. Include R, N, E in new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters.

Possible candidates:
- STERN (but E is in position 5, which is invalid)
- TRINE (E in 5, invalid)
- DRIER (E in 5, invalid)
- PRONE (E in 5, invalid)

Let’s try ""TRIPE"":
- T, I, P are new letters.
- R in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2) → invalid.

""TRINE"" is invalid because E is in position 5.

""RENTS"":
- R in 1, E in 2, N in 3, T in 4, S in 5.
- R is not in position 2 (good).
- E is not in position 5 (good).
- N is not in position 4 (good).
- Introduces T and S (new letters).

This seems valid.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: RENTS -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) N(-) T(x) S(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word at all:
- C, A, T, S (from CRANE and RENTS)

Letters that ARE in the word (but we still don’t know their exact positions):
- R (cannot be in position 1 or 2)
- N (cannot be in position 3 or 4)
- E (cannot be in position 2 or 5)

So the word must contain R, N, E, and must avoid:
- positions 1 for R, 2 for R, 3 for N, 4 for N, 2 for E, 5 for E
- letters C, A, T, S

We still need to test new common letters. Good remaining consonants: D, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc. Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

We want a word that:
- uses R, N, E in allowed positions
- introduces new common letters
- avoids all banned letters and positions

Possible positions for each required letter:
R: can be in 3, 4, or 5
N: can be in 1 or 2
E: can be in 1, 3, or 4

Let’s try to place N in position 1 (most restrictive spot left for N), then R and E in remaining allowed spots, and fill the last slot with a new common consonant.

Candidate: N _ _ _ _
We need R and E somewhere in 2-5, avoiding their forbidden spots.

Let’s try N E R _ _  → but E can’t be in 2 (from RENTS feedback: E(-) in position 2).

Next: N R E _ _  → R in 2 is forbidden (from CRANE feedback: R(-) in position 2).

Next: N _ R E _  → R in 3 is allowed, E in 4 is allowed.

Word so far: N _ R E _

We need one more letter. Good new consonants: D, L, M, P, B, etc.

Let’s try N I R E D → but D is new, I is new vowel, R in 3, E in 4.

Check positions:
- R in 3 (allowed)
- N in 1 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- I and D are new

This seems valid.

Let’s summarize what we know after three guesses.

Letters NOT in the word at all:  
C, A, T, S, D

Letters that ARE in the word (but whose positions are still unknown):  
R, N, E, I

Positions that these letters **cannot** occupy:  
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from CRANE, RENTS, NIRED feedback)  
- N cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from CRANE, RENTS, NIRED feedback)  
- E cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from CRANE, RENTS, NIRED feedback)  
- I cannot be in position 2 (from NIRED feedback)

Remaining possible positions for each letter:
- R: only position 4 or 5  
- N: only position 2  
- E: only position 1 or 3  
- I: positions 1, 3, 4, 5  

We still need one more letter (not yet used). Good remaining consonants: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to build a valid word using the constraints.

Step 1: Fix N in position 2 (only remaining spot for N).  
Word skeleton: _ N _ _ _

Step 2: Place R in position 4 (only remaining spot for R).  
Word skeleton: _ N _ R _

Step 3: Place E in position 1 or 3.  
- If E in 1: E N _ R _  
- If E in 3: _ N E R _

Step 4: Place I in one of the remaining spots (positions 1, 3, 4, 5), avoiding conflicts.  
- If E in 1: E N _ R _ → I must go in 3 or 5. 3 is already E, so I in 5 → E N _ R I  
- If E in 3: _ N E R _ → I must go in 1 or 5. 1 and 5 are open.

Step 5: Fill the last open spot with a new consonant.  
- E N I R _ → need 5th letter. Good choices: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.  
  ENIRB, ENIRF, etc. – but “ENIRB” isn’t a valid word.  
- E N _ R I → E N _ R I → EN?RI → “ENPRI” not valid.  
- _ N E R I → need 1st letter. Possible: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.  
  B N E R I → “BNERI” no.  
  F N E R I → “FNERI” no.  
  G N E R I → “GNERI” no.  
  H N E R I → “HNERI” no.  
  K N E R I → “KNERI” no.  
  L N E R I → “LNERI” no.  
  M N E R I → “MNERI” no.  
  P N E R I → “PNERI” no.  
  U N E R I → “UNERI” no.  
  V N E R I → “VNERI” no.  
  W N E R I → “WNERI” no.  
  Y N E R I → “YNERI” no.

None of these are valid English words.  
Let’s try E in position 3 instead: _ N E R _  
Now I must go in 1 or 5.  
- I N E R _ → “INER?” – need 5th letter.

  I N E R U → “INERU” no.  
  I N E R V → “INERV” no.  
  I N E R W → “INERW” no.  
  I N E R Y → “INERY” no.

Still nothing.  
Let’s try E in position 1: E N _ R _  
Now I must go in 3 or 5.  
- E N I R _ → “ENIR?” – need 5th letter.  
  E N I R B → “ENIRB” no.  
  E N I R F → “ENIRF” no.  
  E N I R G → “ENIRG” no.

  E N I R V → “ENIRV” no.  
  E N I R W → “ENIRW” no.  
  E N I R Y → “ENIRY” no.

Still nothing.  
Let’s try a different consonant for the final spot.  
We need a valid English word that fits the constraints.  
Looking at the constraints:

- Must contain R, N, E, I  
- N is in position 2  
- R is in position 4  
- E and I must go in remaining spots  
- No C, A, T, S, D  

A valid word that fits: “INFER”  
Check constraints:  
- Letters: I, N, F, E, R  
- N in position 2 ✅  
- R in position 5 (allowed) ✅  
- E in position 3 (allowed) ✅  
- I in position 1 (allowed) ✅

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain by covering common letters and letter positions. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently used letters in English (like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C) and avoid repeating letters. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: x → C is NOT in the word at all.
- R: - → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A: x → A is NOT in the word.
- N: - → N is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E: - → E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C or A.
- Contains R, N, E, but R is not in position 2, N is not in position 4, E is not in position 5.

We need to place R, N, E in new positions and introduce new letters that weren’t used (since we only have 6 guesses). Good letters to try next: S, T, I, O, L, U, D, M, P, etc.

A good second guess should:
1. Include R, N, E in new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters.

Possible candidates:
- STERN (but E is in position 5, which is invalid)
- TRINE (E in 5, invalid)
- DRIER (E in 5, invalid)
- PRONE (E in 5, invalid)

Let’s try ""TRIPE"":
- T, I, P are new letters.
- R in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2) → invalid.

""TRINE"" is invalid because E is in position 5.

""RENTS"":
- R in 1, E in 2, N in 3, T in 4, S in 5.
- R is not in position 2 (good).
- E is not in position 5 (good).
- N is not in position 4 (good).
- Introduces T and S (new letters).

This seems valid.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word at all:
- C, A, T, S (from CRANE and RENTS)

Letters that ARE in the word (but we still don’t know their exact positions):
- R (cannot be in position 1 or 2)
- N (cannot be in position 3 or 4)
- E (cannot be in position 2 or 5)

So the word must contain R, N, E, and must avoid:
- positions 1 for R, 2 for R, 3 for N, 4 for N, 2 for E, 5 for E
- letters C, A, T, S

We still need to test new common letters. Good remaining consonants: D, L, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc. Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

We want a word that:
- uses R, N, E in allowed positions
- introduces new common letters
- avoids all banned letters and positions

Possible positions for each required letter:
R: can be in 3, 4, or 5
N: can be in 1 or 2
E: can be in 1, 3, or 4

Let’s try to place N in position 1 (most restrictive spot left for N), then R and E in remaining allowed spots, and fill the last slot with a new common consonant.

Candidate: N _ _ _ _
We need R and E somewhere in 2-5, avoiding their forbidden spots.

Let’s try N E R _ _  → but E can’t be in 2 (from RENTS feedback: E(-) in position 2).

Next: N R E _ _  → R in 2 is forbidden (from CRANE feedback: R(-) in position 2).

Next: N _ R E _  → R in 3 is allowed, E in 4 is allowed.

Word so far: N _ R E _

We need one more letter. Good new consonants: D, L, M, P, B, etc.

Let’s try N I R E D → but D is new, I is new vowel, R in 3, E in 4.

Check positions:
- R in 3 (allowed)

- E cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from CRANE, RENTS, NIRED feedback)  
- I cannot be in position 2 (from NIRED feedback)

Remaining possible positions for each letter:
- R: only position 4 or 5  
- N: only position 2  
- E: only position 1 or 3  
- I: positions 1, 3, 4, 5  

We still need one more letter (not yet used). Good remaining consonants: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to build a valid word using the constraints.

Step 1: Fix N in position 2 (only remaining spot for N).  
Word skeleton: _ N _ _ _

Step 2: Place R in position 4 (only remaining spot for R).  
Word skeleton: _ N _ R _

Step 3: Place E in position 1 or 3.  
- If E in 1: E N _ R _  
- If E in 3: _ N E R _

Step 4: Place I in one of the remaining spots (positions 1, 3, 4, 5), avoiding conflicts.  
- If E in 1: E N _ R _ → I must go in 3 or 5. 3 is already E, so I in 5 → E N _ R I  
- If E in 3: _ N E R _ → I must go in 1 or 5. 1 and 5 are open.

Step 5: Fill the last open spot with a new consonant.  
- E N I R _ → need 5th letter. Good choices: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.  
  ENIRB, ENIRF, etc. – but “ENIRB” isn’t a valid word.  
- E N _ R I → E N _ R I → EN?RI → “ENPRI” not valid.  
- _ N E R I → need 1st letter. Possible: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.  
  B N E R I → “BNERI” no.  
  F N E R I → “FNERI” no.  
  G N E R I → “GNERI” no.  
  H N E R I → “HNERI” no.

  V N E R I → “VNERI” no.  
  W N E R I → “WNERI” no.  
  Y N E R I → “YNERI” no.

None of these are valid English words.

  I N E R W → “INERW” no.  
  I N E R Y → “INERY” no.

Still nothing.  
Let’s try E in position 1: E N _ R _  
Now I must go in 3 or 5.  
- E N I R _ → “ENIR?” – need 5th letter.  
  E N I R B → “ENIRB” no.  
  E N I R F → “ENIRF” no.  
  E N I R G → “ENIRG” no.

  E N I R V → “ENIRV” no.  
  E N I R W → “ENIRW” no.  
  E N I R Y → “ENIRY” no.

Still nothing.  
Let’s try a different consonant for the final spot.  
We need a valid English word that fits the constraints.  
Looking at the constraints:

- Must contain R, N, E, I  
- N is in position 2  
- R is in position 4  
- E and I must go in remaining spots  
- No C, A, T, S, D  

A valid word that fits: “INFER”  
Check constraints:  
- Letters: I, N, F, E, R  
- N in position 2 ✅  
- R in position 5 (allowed) ✅  
- E in position 3 (allowed) ✅  
- I in position 1 (allowed) ✅  
- No banned letters ✅  

This satisfies every constraint.

We now have four rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
2. RENTS → R(-) E(-) N(-) T(x) S(x)
3. NIRED → N(-) I(-) R(-) E(-) D(x)
4. INFER → I(✓) N(✓) F(x) E(-) R(-)

From INFER we learned:
- I is in position 1 (✓)
- N is in position 2 (✓)
- F is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- R is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So the word looks like: I N _ _ _

Letters we know must appear: I, N, R, E  
Letters we know do NOT appear: C, A, T, S, D, F

Positions we know:
- 1 = I
- 2 = N
- R is somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5)
- E is somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 4), but position 1 is already I, so E must be in 3 or 5

Let’s list possibilities:
Case 1: E in position 3
Then R must be in position 4
Word: I N E R _

We need a 5th letter that is not any of C, A, T, S, D, F, and must form a valid word.
Possible consonants left: B, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Valid word ending: “INERB”, “INERG”, etc. – none of these are valid English words.

Case 2: E in position 5
Then R must be in position 3 or 4
Sub-case 2a: R in 3
Word: I N R _ E
Need a 4th letter that is not any of C, A, T, S, D, F
Possible letters: B, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Valid words: “INRBE”, “INRGE”, etc. – none valid.

Sub-case 2b: R in 4
Word: I N _ R E
Need a 3rd letter that is not any of C, A, T, S, D, F
Possible letters: B, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Valid words: “INBRE”, “INGRE”, etc. – none valid except “INGRE” which isn’t a word.

Wait – let’s think differently. We have the letters I, N, R, E fixed in positions 1,2, and we need to place R and E in remaining spots with constraints.

We know:
- R cannot be in 2,5 → must be in 3 or 4
- E cannot be in 2,4 → must be in 1,3,5 but 1 is I, so 3 or 5

So possible combinations:
- R in 3, E in 5 → I N R _ E → need 4th letter. Valid word: “INRBE” no, “INRGE” no, “INRHE” no, “INRKE” no, “INRLE” no, “INRME” no, “INRPE” no, “INRUE” no, “INRVE” no, “INRWE” no, “INRYE” no – none valid.

- R in 4, E in 3 → I N E R _ → need 5th letter. Valid word: “INERB” no, “INERG” no, “INERH” no, “INERK” no, “INERL” no, “INERM” no, “INERP” no, “INERU” no, “INERV” no, “INERW” no, “INERY” no – none valid.

- R in 4, E in 5 → I N _ R E → need 3rd letter. Valid word: “INBRE” no, “INGRE” no, “INHRE” no, “INKRE” no, “INLRE” no, “INMRE” no, “INPRE” no, “INURE” no, “INVRE” no, “INWRE” no, “INYRE” no – none valid.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let me re-examine the constraints more carefully.

Wait – we have the letters I, N, R, E and need to place them in positions 1,2,3,4,5 with:
- I fixed at 1
- N fixed at 2
- R must be in 3 or 4
- E must be in 3 or 5

So possible placements:
- If R is in 3, E must be in 5 → I N R _ E
- If R is in 4, E must be in 3 → I N E R _

Let’s check if any of these with a valid 5th letter work.

For I N R _ E:
Need a 4th letter that is not C,A,T,S,D,F. Possible letters: B, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Valid English word: “INRBE” – no. “INRGE” – no. “INRHE” – no. “INRKE” – no. “INRLE” – no. “INRM” – no. “INRP” – no. “INRU” – no. “INRVE” – no. “INRWE” – no. “INRYE” – no. None valid.

For I N E R _:
Need a 5th letter. Valid word: “INERB” – no. “INERG” – no. “INERH” – no. “INERK” – no. “INERL” – no. “INERM” – no. “INERP” – no. “INERU” – no. “INERV” – no. “INERW” – no. “INERY” – no. None valid.

This suggests we might have missed a valid word. Let me think of other possibilities.

Wait – we have the letters I, N, R, E and need to place them with the constraints:
- I at 1, N at 2
- R must be in 3 or 4
- E must be in 3 or 5

So possible words:
- I N E R _ : Need a 5th letter. Valid word: “INERB” – no. “INERG” – no. “INERH” – no. “INERK” – no. “INERL” – no. “INERM” – no. “INERP” – no. “INERU” – no. “INERV” – no. “INERW” – no. “INERY” – no. None valid.

- I N R _ E : Need a 4th letter. Valid word: “INRBE” – no. “INRGE” – no. “INRHE” – no. “INRKE” – no. “INRLE” – no. “INRM” – no. “INRP” – no. “INRU” – no. “INRVE” – no. “INRWE” – no. “INRYE” – no. None valid.

This seems impossible. Let me re-examine the feedback more carefully.

From INFER:
- I(✓) N(✓) F(x) E(-) R(-)
This means:
- I is in position 1
- N is in position 2
- F is not in the word
- E is in the word but not in position 4
- R is in the word but not in position 5

So the word is I N _ _ _ with R and E still to place in positions 3,4,5 under constraints:
- R cannot be in 5
- E cannot be in 4

So possible placements:
- R in 3, E in 5 → I N R _ E → need 4th letter
- R in 3, E in 5 → same as above
- R in 4, E in 3 → I N E R _
- R in 4, E in 5 → I N _ R E

Let’s try R in 4, E in 3 → I N E R _ → need 5th letter. Valid word: “INERB” – no. “INERG” – no. “INERH” – no. “INERK” – no. “INERL” – no. “INERM” – no. “INERP” – no. “INERU” – no. “INERV” – no. “INERW” – no. “INERY” – no. None valid.

Let’s try R in 4, E in 5 → I N _ R E → need 3rd letter. Valid word: “INBRE” – no. “INGRE” – no. “INHRE” – no. “INKRE” – no. “INLRE” – no. “INMRE” – no. “INPRE” – no. “INURE” – no. “INVRE” – no. “INWRE” – no. “INYRE” – no. None valid.

This suggests we might have missed a valid word. Let me think differently – perhaps the word is “INURE” (a variant spelling of “inure” meaning to accustom). But “INURE” is valid.

Check constraints:
- I N U R E
- I at 1 ✓
- N at 2 ✓
- R at 4 (allowed, not 5) ✓
- E at 5 (allowed, not 4) ✓
- U is a new letter, not in any banned list ✓
- No C, A, T, S, D, F ✓

This seems to fit all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be “INURE”.

<guess>INURE</guess>",INURE,"We now have four rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
2. RENTS → R(-) E(-) N(-) T(x) S(x)
3. NIRED → N(-) I(-) R(-) E(-) D(x)
4. INFER → I(✓) N(✓) F(x) E(-) R(-)

From INFER we learned:

- N is in position 2 (✓)
- F is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- R is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So the word looks like: I N _ _ _

Letters we know must appear: I, N, R, E  
Letters we know do NOT appear: C, A, T, S, D, F

Positions we know:
- 1 = I
- 2 = N
- R is somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5)
- E is somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 4), but position 1 is already I, so E must be in 3 or 5

Let’s list possibilities:
Case 1: E in position 3
Then R must be in position 4
Word: I N E R _

We need a 5th letter that is not any of C, A, T, S, D, F, and must form a valid word.
Possible consonants left: B, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Valid word ending: “INERB”, “INERG”, etc. – none of these are valid English words.

Case 2: E in position 5
Then R must be in position 3 or 4
Sub-case 2a: R in 3
Word: I N R _ E
Need a 4th letter that is not any of C, A, T, S, D, F
Possible letters: B, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Valid words: “INRBE”, “INRGE”, etc. – none valid.

Sub-case 2b: R in 4
Word: I N _ R E
Need a 3rd letter that is not any of C, A, T, S, D, F
Possible letters: B, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Valid words: “INBRE”, “INGRE”, etc. – none valid except “INGRE” which isn’t a word.

Wait – let’s think differently. We have the letters I, N, R, E fixed in positions 1,2, and we need to place R and E in remaining spots with constraints.

We know:
- R cannot be in 2,5 → must be in 3 or 4
- E cannot be in 2,4 → must be in 1,3,5 but 1 is I, so 3 or 5

So possible combinations:
- R in 3, E in 5 → I N R _ E → need 4th letter. Valid word: “INRBE” no, “INRGE” no, “INRHE” no, “INRKE” no, “INRLE” no, “INRME” no, “INRPE” no, “INRUE” no, “INRVE” no, “INRWE” no, “INRYE” no – none valid.

- R in 4, E in 3 → I N E R _ → need 5th letter. Valid word: “INERB” no, “INERG” no, “INERH” no, “INERK” no, “INERL” no, “INERM” no, “INERP” no, “INERU” no, “INERV” no, “INERW” no, “INERY” no – none valid.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let me re-examine the constraints more carefully.

Wait – we have the letters I, N, R, E and need to place them in positions 1,2,3,4,5 with:
- I fixed at 1

So possible placements:
- If R is in 3, E must be in 5 → I N R _ E
- If R is in 4, E must be in 3 → I N E R _

Let’s check if any of these with a valid 5th letter work.

For I N R _ E:
Need a 4th letter that is not C,A,T,S,D,F. Possible letters: B, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Valid English word: “INRBE” – no. “INRGE” – no. “INRHE” – no. “INRKE” – no. “INRLE” – no. “INRM” – no. “INRP” – no. “INRU” – no. “INRVE” – no. “INRWE” – no. “INRYE” – no. None valid.

For I N E R _:
Need a 5th letter. Valid word: “INERB” – no. “INERG” – no. “INERH” – no. “INERK” – no. “INERL” – no. “INERM” – no. “INERP” – no. “INERU” – no. “INERV” – no. “INERW” – no. “INERY” – no. None valid.

This suggests we might have missed a valid word. Let me think of other possibilities.

Wait – we have the letters I, N, R, E and need to place them with the constraints:
- I at 1, N at 2
- R must be in 3 or 4
- E must be in 3 or 5

So possible words:
- I N E R _ : Need a 5th letter. Valid word: “INERB” – no. “INERG” – no. “INERH” – no. “INERK” – no. “INERL” – no. “INERM” – no. “INERP” – no. “INERU” – no. “INERV” – no. “INERW” – no. “INERY” – no. None valid.

- I N R _ E : Need a 4th letter. Valid word: “INRBE” – no. “INRGE” – no. “INRHE” – no. “INRKE” – no. “INRLE” – no. “INRM” – no. “INRP” – no. “INRU” – no. “INRVE” – no. “INRWE” – no. “INRYE” – no. None valid.

This seems impossible. Let me re-examine the feedback more carefully.

From INFER:
- I(✓) N(✓) F(x) E(-) R(-)
This means:
- I is in position 1
- N is in position 2
- F is not in the word
- E is in the word but not in position 4
- R is in the word but not in position 5

So the word is I N _ _ _ with R and E still to place in positions 3,4,5 under constraints:
- R cannot be in 5
- E cannot be in 4

So possible placements:
- R in 3, E in 5 → I N R _ E → need 4th letter
- R in 3, E in 5 → same as above
- R in 4, E in 3 → I N E R _
- R in 4, E in 5 → I N _ R E

Let’s try R in 4, E in 3 → I N E R _ → need 5th letter. Valid word: “INERB” – no. “INERG” – no. “INERH” – no. “INERK” – no. “INERL” – no. “INERM” – no. “INERP” – no. “INERU” – no. “INERV” – no. “INERW” – no. “INERY” – no. None valid.

Let’s try R in 4, E in 5 → I N _ R E → need 3rd letter. Valid word: “INBRE” – no. “INGRE” – no. “INHRE” – no. “INKRE” – no. “INLRE” – no. “INMRE” – no. “INPRE” – no. “INURE” – no. “INVRE” – no. “INWRE” – no. “INYRE” – no. None valid.

This suggests we might have missed a valid word. Let me think differently – perhaps the word is “INURE” (a variant spelling of “inure” meaning to accustom). But “INURE” is valid.

Check constraints:
- I N U R E
- I at 1 ✓
- N at 2 ✓
- R at 4 (allowed, not 5) ✓
- E at 5 (allowed, not 4) ✓
- U is a new letter, not in any banned list ✓
- No C, A, T, S, D, F ✓

This seems to fit all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess should be “INURE”.",Guess 6: INURE -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) N(✓) U(x) R(✓) E(-),FAIL
