1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E - covering common consonants and vowels.
- ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E - also common letters.
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - very common letters.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters in English words.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → 3rd letter is A
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word looks like: _ _ A _ _

We need a 5-letter word with A in the 3rd position, and none of S, L, T, E appear anywhere.  
Remaining common consonants and vowels to try next: R, N, I, O, U, C, D, etc.

A good next guess would use new common letters while keeping A fixed.  
Possible candidates: CRANE, DRANK, GRASP, PRANK, etc.  
Among these, ""CRANE"" introduces C, R, N which are all frequent and haven’t been tested yet.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E - covering common consonants and vowels.
- ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E - also common letters.
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - very common letters.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters in English words.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → 3rd letter is A
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So the secret word looks like: _ _ A _ _

We need a 5-letter word with A in the 3rd position, and none of S, L, T, E appear anywhere.  
Remaining common consonants and vowels to try next: R, N, I, O, U, C, D, etc.

A good next guess would use new common letters while keeping A fixed.  
Possible candidates: CRANE, DRANK, GRASP, PRANK, etc.  
Among these, ""CRANE"" introduces C, R, N which are all frequent and haven’t been tested yet.

So far we know:

- Letters already ruled out: S, L, T, E, C, R, N.

Remaining common consonants and vowels: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with A in the 3rd spot and none of the forbidden letters.  
A good strategy is to try a word that uses fresh, common letters while keeping A fixed.  
Possible candidates:  
- BAGGY (B, G, Y) – but Y is less common.  
- DAGGER (too long).  
- MANGO (M, N, G, O) – but N is forbidden.  
- PADDY (P, D, Y) – Y is okay.  
- GUMMY (G, M, M, Y) – Y is okay.  

Among these, “PADDY” uses P, D, Y which are all still allowed and fairly common.

3. From PADDY we got:
   - P(x) – P is out  
   - A(-) – A is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - D(x) – D is out  
   - D(x) – D is out  
   - Y(✓) – Y is in the word and in the correct position (last letter).

So the word must be _ _ A _ Y and cannot contain any of S, L, T, E, C, R, N, P, D.

Remaining common consonants: B, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, O, U (A is already used in position 3).

We need a 5-letter word that ends in A _ Y and uses none of the forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- BAGGY – G is allowed, but Y is already in position 5, so this would be B A G G Y, which has G twice and fits the pattern _ _ A _ Y.  
- FUMMY – but M is allowed, and this fits _ _ A _ Y.  
- HUMMY – H is allowed.  
- GUMMY – G and M are allowed.  
- BAGGY seems the most common word among these.

Let’s try BAGGY.

From all feedback so far:

- Pattern: _ _ A _ Y  (A is in the word, Y is in the last position)
- Letters ruled out entirely: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, P, D, B, G

Remaining common consonants: F, H, K, M, V, W, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, O, U (A is already used in position 3)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 3
2. Has Y in position 5
3. Uses none of the forbidden letters above

Possible patterns: _ _ A _ Y

Let’s list valid candidates:
- FAMLY – but L is forbidden
- HAMMY – M is allowed, but Y is already used in position 5, so this would be H A M M Y which fits
- VAMBY – B is forbidden
- KAMMY – M is allowed, K is allowed
- HAMMY and KAMMY are both valid

Between these, HAMMY seems more common.

Let’s try HAMMY.
