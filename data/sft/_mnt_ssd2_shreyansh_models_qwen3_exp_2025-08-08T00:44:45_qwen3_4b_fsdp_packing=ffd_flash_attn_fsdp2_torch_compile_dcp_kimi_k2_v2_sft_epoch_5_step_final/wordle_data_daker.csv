For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. The best strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once.

Common consonants and vowels to target include:
- Consonants: S, T, R, N, L
- Vowels: A, E, I, O, U

A good first guess should ideally contain:
1. At least 3 different vowels (but not too many, since vowels are less common in 5-letter words)
2. 3 common consonants
3. No repeated letters

Some excellent starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""STARE"" as it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- T (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- E (most common ending letter)

This should give us good coverage of common letters and positions.

- LANCE (L and C are good test letters)
- EAGER (tests E in position 1, but we know E is not in position 5)
- RAPID (but D is less common)

- R is not in position 4 (STARE) and not in position 2 (CRANE) → R is not in positions 2 or 4.  
- E is not in position 5 (STARE) and not in position 4 (CRANE) → E is not in positions 4 or 5.

So the word must contain A, R, E exactly once each, and two new letters (not S,T,C,N).  
Available common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

2. Uses two new letters from the remaining pool.
3. Has no S, T, C, N.

- _ A _ _ _ (A not in position 3)  
- _ _ A _ _ (A not in position 3)

3. Introduces new common letters to test (like N, L, C, etc.)

Possible candidates:
- CRANE (but N is common and we haven’t tested it)
- LANCE (L and C are good test letters)
- EAGER (tests E in position 1, but we know E is not in position 5)
- RAPID (but D is less common)
- CRANE seems good because:
  - Uses C (new consonant)
  - Uses N (new consonant)
  - Keeps A and R in different positions
  - Tests E in position 4 (since we know E is not in position 5)

Let me choose CRANE.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, C, N  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, R, E (each appears once)  

Positions ruled out so far:
- A is not in position 3 (STARE) and not in position 3 again (CRANE) → A is not in position 3 at all.  
- R is not in position 4 (STARE) and not in position 2 (CRANE) → R is not in positions 2 or 4.  
- E is not in position 5 (STARE) and not in position 4 (CRANE) → E is not in positions 4 or 5.

So the word must contain A, R, E exactly once each, and two new letters (not S,T,C,N).  
Available common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Available vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are already used).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A, R, E in allowed positions.
2. Uses two new letters from the remaining pool.
3. Has no S, T, C, N.

Let’s try to place A, R, E in new positions:

Possible patterns:
- A _ _ _ _ (A not in position 3)  
- _ A _ _ _ (A not in position 3)  
- _ _ A _ _ (A not in position 3)  
- _ _ _ A _ (A not in position 3)  
- _ _ _ _ A (A not in position 3)  

Similarly for R and E.

A good candidate is “BREAD”:
- Letters: B (new), R (must be used), E (must be used), A (must be used), D (new).  
- Positions:  
  – R is in position 2 (allowed, since it’s not 2 or 4)  
  – E is in position 3 (allowed, since it’s not 4 or 5)  
  – A is in position 4 (allowed, since it’s not 3)  
- No forbidden letters (S,T,C,N).

Let’s summarize what we now know after the three guesses:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, C, N, B  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, R, E (each exactly once)  
Positions ruled out so far:
- A is not in positions 3, 4 (from STARE and BREAD)  
- R is not in positions 2, 4 (from CRANE and BREAD)  
- E is not in positions 4, 5 (from CRANE and BREAD)

So the word must be made from the letters {A, R, E} plus two new letters from the remaining pool (common letters not yet ruled out: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.).

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, E exactly once each.
2. Does not contain S, T, C, N, B.
3. Places A, R, E in positions that have not been ruled out.

Let’s list the allowed positions for each:
- A: positions 1, 2, 5 (cannot be 3 or 4)
- R: positions 1, 3, 5 (cannot be 2 or 4)
- E: positions 1, 2, 3 (cannot be 4 or 5)

We need two additional letters. Common choices might be D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, etc.

Let’s try to construct a word that satisfies these constraints. One promising pattern is to place A in position 1, R in position 3, E in position 2, and fill the remaining two positions with new letters.

Example: A E R _ _ → but that would place R in position 3 (allowed), E in position 2 (allowed), A in position 1 (allowed). The remaining two letters need to be new.

A common word that fits is ""EARLY"":
- Letters: E, A, R, L, Y
- Positions:
  – E in 1 (allowed)
  – A in 2 (allowed)
  – R in 3 (allowed)
  – L and Y are new letters not yet used.

Let’s verify:
- Contains A, R, E exactly once.
- Does not contain any forbidden letters (S, T, C, N, B).
- Positions of A, R, E are all allowed.

So ""EARLY"" is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. The best strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once.

Common consonants and vowels to target include:
- Consonants: S, T, R, N, L
- Vowels: A, E, I, O, U

A good first guess should ideally contain:
1. At least 3 different vowels (but not too many, since vowels are less common in 5-letter words)
2. 3 common consonants
3. No repeated letters

Some excellent starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""STARE"" as it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- T (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- E (most common ending letter)

This should give us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on STARE:
- S: x → not in the word at all
- T: x → not in the word at all
- A: - → in the word but not in position 3
- R: - → in the word but not in position 4
- E: - → in the word but not in position 5

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S or T
- Contains A, R, and E somewhere (but not in the positions shown)

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Avoids S and T entirely
2. Uses A, R, and E in different positions
3. Introduces new common letters to test (like N, L, C, etc.)

Possible candidates:
- CRANE (but N is common and we haven’t tested it)
- LANCE (L and C are good test letters)
- EAGER (tests E in position 1, but we know E is not in position 5)
- RAPID (but D is less common)
- CRANE seems good because:
  - Uses C (new consonant)
  - Uses N (new consonant)
  - Keeps A and R in different positions
  - Tests E in position 4 (since we know E is not in position 5)

Let me choose CRANE.

- E is not in position 5 (STARE) and not in position 4 (CRANE) → E is not in positions 4 or 5.

So the word must contain A, R, E exactly once each, and two new letters (not S,T,C,N).  
Available common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Available vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are already used).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A, R, E in allowed positions.
2. Uses two new letters from the remaining pool.
3. Has no S, T, C, N.

Let’s try to place A, R, E in new positions:

Possible patterns:
- A _ _ _ _ (A not in position 3)  
- _ A _ _ _ (A not in position 3)  
- _ _ A _ _ (A not in position 3)  
- _ _ _ A _ (A not in position 3)  
- _ _ _ _ A (A not in position 3)  

Similarly for R and E.

A good candidate is “BREAD”:
- Letters: B (new), R (must be used), E (must be used), A (must be used), D (new).  
- Positions:  
  – R is in position 2 (allowed, since it’s not 2 or 4)

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. The best strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once.

Common consonants and vowels to target include:
- Consonants: S, T, R, N, L
- Vowels: A, E, I, O, U

A good first guess should ideally contain:
1. At least 3 different vowels (but not too many, since vowels are less common in 5-letter words)
2. 3 common consonants
3. No repeated letters

Some excellent starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""STARE"" as it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- T (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- E (most common ending letter)

This should give us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: STARE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on STARE:
- S: x → not in the word at all
- T: x → not in the word at all
- A: - → in the word but not in position 3
- R: - → in the word but not in position 4
- E: - → in the word but not in position 5

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S or T
- Contains A, R, and E somewhere (but not in the positions shown)

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Avoids S and T entirely
2. Uses A, R, and E in different positions
3. Introduces new common letters to test (like N, L, C, etc.)

Possible candidates:
- CRANE (but N is common and we haven’t tested it)
- LANCE (L and C are good test letters)
- EAGER (tests E in position 1, but we know E is not in position 5)
- RAPID (but D is less common)
- CRANE seems good because:
  - Uses C (new consonant)
  - Uses N (new consonant)
  - Keeps A and R in different positions
  - Tests E in position 4 (since we know E is not in position 5)

Let me choose CRANE.

Guess 2: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, C, N  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, R, E (each appears once)  

Positions ruled out so far:
- A is not in position 3 (STARE) and not in position 3 again (CRANE) → A is not in position 3 at all.  
- R is not in position 4 (STARE) and not in position 2 (CRANE) → R is not in positions 2 or 4.  
- E is not in position 5 (STARE) and not in position 4 (CRANE) → E is not in positions 4 or 5.

So the word must contain A, R, E exactly once each, and two new letters (not S,T,C,N).  
Available common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Available vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are already used).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A, R, E in allowed positions.
2. Uses two new letters from the remaining pool.
3. Has no S, T, C, N.

Let’s try to place A, R, E in new positions:

Possible patterns:
- A _ _ _ _ (A not in position 3)  
- _ A _ _ _ (A not in position 3)  
- _ _ A _ _ (A not in position 3)  
- _ _ _ A _ (A not in position 3)  
- _ _ _ _ A (A not in position 3)  

Similarly for R and E.

A good candidate is “BREAD”:
- Letters: B (new), R (must be used), E (must be used), A (must be used), D (new).  
- Positions:  
  – R is in position 2 (allowed, since it’s not 2 or 4)  
  – E is in position 3 (allowed, since it’s not 4 or 5)  
  – A is in position 4 (allowed, since it’s not 3)  
- No forbidden letters (S,T,C,N).

Let’s go with BREAD.

Let’s summarize what we now know after the three guesses:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T, C, N, B  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, R, E (each exactly once)  
Positions ruled out so far:
- A is not in positions 3, 4 (from STARE and BREAD)  
- R is not in positions 2, 4 (from CRANE and BREAD)  
- E is not in positions 4, 5 (from CRANE and BREAD)

So the word must be made from the letters {A, R, E} plus two new letters from the remaining pool (common letters not yet ruled out: D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.).

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, E exactly once each.
2. Does not contain S, T, C, N, B.
3. Places A, R, E in positions that have not been ruled out.

Let’s list the allowed positions for each:
- A: positions 1, 2, 5 (cannot be 3 or 4)
- R: positions 1, 3, 5 (cannot be 2 or 4)
- E: positions 1, 2, 3 (cannot be 4 or 5)

We need two additional letters. Common choices might be D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, etc.

Let’s try to construct a word that satisfies these constraints. One promising pattern is to place A in position 1, R in position 3, E in position 2, and fill the remaining two positions with new letters.

Example: A E R _ _ → but that would place R in position 3 (allowed), E in position 2 (allowed), A in position 1 (allowed). The remaining two letters need to be new.

A common word that fits is ""EARLY"":
- Letters: E, A, R, L, Y
- Positions:
  – E in 1 (allowed)
  – A in 2 (allowed)
  – R in 3 (allowed)
  – L and Y are new letters not yet used.

Let’s verify:
- Contains A, R, E exactly once.
- Does not contain any forbidden letters (S, T, C, N, B).
- Positions of A, R, E are all allowed.

So ""EARLY"" is a valid next guess.

- A: ✓ → correct letter in correct position (position 2)
- R: - → in the word but not in position 3
- L: x → not in the word

So now we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _
2. The letters A, R, E are all present (A is fixed in position 2).
3. Letters NOT in the word: S, T, C, N, B, L, Y.
4. Positions ruled out:
   - R is not in positions 2, 3, 4 (from CRANE, BREAD, EARLY feedback).
   - E is not in positions 1, 4, 5 (from CRANE, BREAD, EARLY feedback).
   - A is already fixed in position 2.

Therefore:
- R must be in position 1 or 5 (but not 2,3,4).
- E must be in position 3 (since it can't be 1,4,5).
- We need two more letters (not yet ruled out) for positions 4 and 5 (or 1 and 4, depending on where R goes).

Possible patterns:
- If R is in position 1: R A E _ _
- If R is in position 5: _ A E _ R

Let's check common words fitting these patterns:
- R A E _ _ : ""RAISE"" but S is forbidden.
- R A E _ _ : ""RAVEN"" but N is forbidden.
- _ A E _ R : ""FAKER"" (but K and F are allowed, and we need to check letters).
- _ A E _ R : ""PAVER"" (P and V are allowed).

""PAVER"" fits:
- P, A, V, E, R
- Contains A in position 2 (correct).
- Contains E in position 4 (allowed, since E can be 3 or 4, but we have E in 4 here).
- Contains R in position 5 (allowed, since R can be 1 or 5).
- Letters P, V are new and not yet ruled out.

From the feedback on PAVER:
- P: x → not in the word
- A: ✓ → correct letter in correct position (position 2)
- V: x → not in the word
- E: ✓ → correct letter in correct position (position 4)
- R: ✓ → correct letter in correct position (position 5)

So the pattern is now:
_ A _ E R

We know the word has:
- A in position 2
- E in position 4
- R in position 5

Letters NOT in the word: S, T, C, N, B, L, Y, P, V

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 3. These letters must not have been ruled out and must form a valid 5-letter English word.

Possible letters left: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, U, W, etc.

Looking for common words that fit _ A _ E R:
- F A K E R → ""FAKER"" (K and F are allowed)
- D A M E R → ""DAMER"" (not a common word)
- G A M E R → ""GAMER"" (G and M are allowed)
- H A M E R → ""HAMER"" (not common)
- M A C E R → ""MACER"" (C is forbidden)
- F A I E R → ""FAIER"" (not a word)
- D A I E R → ""DAIER"" (not a word)

""FAKER"" is a valid word and uses allowed letters (F, K not yet ruled out).

So the next guess is FAKER.
