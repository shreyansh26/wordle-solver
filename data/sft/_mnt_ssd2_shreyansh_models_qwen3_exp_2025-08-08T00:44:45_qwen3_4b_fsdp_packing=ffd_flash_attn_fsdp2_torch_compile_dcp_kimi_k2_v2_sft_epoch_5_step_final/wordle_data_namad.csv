For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C.

A popular starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters and has no repeating letters. This gives me the best chance to gather information about the secret word's composition.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of 'O' and 'E' which are very common.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it balances common letters and provides good coverage.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) : R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) : O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) : S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) : E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, S, E.
- The letter A is in the word but not in position 1.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter A (but not in position 1).
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Let’s think of common consonants and vowels that remain: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, I, U, Y, K, etc.

A good next guess would use other common letters while placing A in a different position. A word like “PLANT” comes to mind, but it has N and T which are common, and it places A in position 3. However, we might want to test more vowels or consonants.

Another candidate is “MANGO”, but it has O (already ruled out).

“BLOAT” has O (ruled out).

“LACED” has E (ruled out).

“DRAIN” has R (ruled out).

“BLAND” has N and D, but no new vowels/consonants.

“TABBY” has B, T, Y, but we might want more coverage.

“CABIN” has C, I, N, but no new letters.

“HAPPY” has P, Y, but repeats P.

“GAMUT” has G, M, U, T, but no new letters.

“LAKES” has E, S (ruled out).

Let’s choose “PANIC”:
- Contains A (position 2).
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
- Uses P, N, I, C which are all new letters.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. PANIC → P(x) A(✓) N(-) I(x) C(x)
   - A is in the word AND in position 2 (✓).
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
   - P, I, C are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Fixed letter: A in position 2.
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, I, C.
- Letter N is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Remaining letters to consider (common ones): T, L, D, M, B, G, H, U, Y, K, F, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2.
- N somewhere except position 3.
- No R, O, S, E, P, I, C.

Possible patterns:
- _ A _ _ _
- N can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s brainstorm:
- N A _ _ _ : e.g., NADIR (but I is out), NABOB (B and O are out), NAGAS (S is out), NAVAL (L is okay), NAKED (E is out), NAMBL (L is okay).
- _ A N _ _ : e.g., BANAL (L is okay), DANCE (E is out), GANJA (J is okay), HANNA (N is in position 3, but N can’t be there), MANNA (N is in position 3, but N can’t be there), VANQU (not a word).
- _ A _ N _ : e.g., BANAL (N in 4), DANKY (Y is okay), GANJA (N in 4), HANNA (N in 4), MANNA (N in 4), VANQU (not a word).
- _ A _ _ N : e.g., BANJO (O is out), DANKY (Y is okay), GANJA (J is okay), HANNA (N in 5), MANNA (N in 5), VANQU (not a word).

Looking at valid English words:
- BANAL: B, A, N, A, L → contains A twice, but A is already known to be in position 2. This would place A in position 4, which is allowed since we only know A is in position 2. However, we haven’t ruled out A appearing twice, but it’s a valid word.
- DANKY: D, A, N, K, Y → uses D, K, Y which are new letters, N is in position 3 (but N can’t be in position 3), so invalid.
- GANJA: G, A, N, J, A → N is in position 3 (invalid), invalid.
- HANNA: H, A, N, N, A → N is in position 3 (invalid), invalid.
- MANNA: M, A, N, N, A → N is in position 3 (invalid), invalid.
- VANQU: not a word.

Wait, let’s re-examine:
- BANAL: positions are 1-B, 2-A, 3-N, 4-A, 5-L. N is in position 3, which is invalid (feedback said N is not in position 3). So BANAL is invalid.

Looking again for words with A in position 2 and N not in position 3:
- DANKY: N in position 3 (invalid).
- GANJA: N in position 3 (invalid).
- HANNA: N in position 3 (invalid).
- MANNA: N in position 3 (invalid).

Let’s try:
- N A _ _ _: NABOB (O is out), NAGAS (S is out), NAVAL (L is okay), NAKED (E is out), NAMBL (L is okay).
  - NAVAL: N, A, V, A, L → A is in position 2, N is in position 1 (allowed), V, L are new letters. This seems valid.
- _ A N _ _: BANAL (invalid), DANCE (E out), GANJA (invalid), HANNA (invalid), MANNA (invalid), VANQU (invalid).
- _ A _ N _: BANAL (invalid), DANKY (invalid), GANJA (invalid), HANNA (invalid), MANNA (invalid), VANQU (invalid).
- _ A _ _ N: BANJO (O out), DANKY (invalid), GANJA (invalid), HANNA (invalid), MANNA (invalid), VANQU (invalid).

The only valid word seems to be NAVAL:
- N A V A L
- A is in position 2 (✓).
- N is in position 1 (not position 3, so allowed).
- No R, O, S, E, P, I, C.
- Uses new letters V and L.

But wait, let’s check if there are others:
- N A M B L (not a word).
- N A B L E (E out).
- N A B L Y (Y is okay, but is NABLY a word? It’s archaic, but let’s check: NABLY means to take by force, but it’s valid in some dictionaries. However, it’s less common.)
- N A M B A (not a word).
- N A V A L seems the best.

Another candidate: D A N G Y (but A must be in position 2, so D A N G Y has A in position 2, N in position 3 (invalid), so no).

G A N J A: A in position 2, N in position 3 (invalid).

H A N D Y: A in position 2, N in position 3 (invalid).

So the only valid word seems to be NAVAL or NABLY.

Between these, NAVAL is more common and uses V and L which are new letters.

But wait, let’s think of another:
- T A N G Y: A in position 2, N in position 3 (invalid).
- B A N K S: S out.
- B A N K Y: Y is okay, N in position 3 (invalid).
- B A N K S: S out.

Another approach: use a word where N is in position 4 or 5.

- B A L L Y: A in position 2, N not present (but we know N is in the word), so invalid.
- B A N K Y: N in position 3 (invalid).
- B A N K S: S out.
- B A N G Y: N in position 3 (invalid).
- B A N K Y: same.

Let’s try:
- B A N K Y: N in position 3 (invalid).

Another candidate: D A N C Y: C out.

G A N G Y: N in position 3 (invalid).

H A N G Y: N in position 3 (invalid).

M A N K Y: N in position 3 (invalid).

V A N G Y: N in position 3 (invalid).

So it seems the only valid word is NAVAL.

But let’s verify:
- NAVAL: N A V A L
  - A in position 2 (✓).
  - N is in position 1 (not position 3, so allowed).
  - Letters used: N, A, V, L. No R, O, S, E, P, I, C.
  - Valid English word.

Thus, NAVAL is the best next guess.

   - A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. PANIC → P(x) A(✓) N(-) I(x) C(x)
   - A is in the word AND in position 2 (✓).
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
   - P, I, C are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Fixed letter: A in position 2.
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, I, C.
- Letter N is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Remaining letters to consider (common ones): T, L, D, M, B, G, H, U, Y, K, F, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2.
- N somewhere except position 3.
- No R, O, S, E, P, I, C.

Possible patterns:
- _ A _ _ _
- N can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s brainstorm:
- N A _ _ _ : e.g., NADIR (but I is out), NABOB (B and O are out), NAGAS (S is out), NAVAL (L is okay), NAKED (E is out), NAMBL (L is okay).
- _ A N _ _ : e.g., BANAL (L is okay), DANCE (E is out), GANJA (J is okay), HANNA (N is in position 3, but N can’t be there), MANNA (N is in position 3, but N can’t be there), VANQU (not a word).
- _ A _ N _ : e.g., BANAL (N in 4), DANKY (Y is okay), GANJA (N in 4), HANNA (N in 4), MANNA (N in 4), VANQU (not a word).
- _ A _ _ N : e.g., BANJO (O is out), DANKY (Y is okay), GANJA (J is okay), HANNA (N in 5), MANNA (N in 5), VANQU (not a word).

Looking at valid English words:
- BANAL: B, A, N, A, L → contains A twice, but A is already known to be in position 2. This would place A in position 4, which is allowed since we only know A is in position 2. However, we haven’t ruled out A appearing twice, but it’s a valid word.
- DANKY: D, A, N, K, Y → uses D, K, Y which are new letters, N is in position 3 (but N can’t be in position 3), so invalid.
- GANJA: G, A, N, J, A → N is in position 3 (invalid), invalid.
- HANNA: H, A, N, N, A → N is in position 3 (invalid), invalid.
- MANNA: M, A, N, N, A → N is in position 3 (invalid), invalid.
- VANQU: not a word.

Wait, let’s re-examine:
- BANAL: positions are 1-B, 2-A, 3-N, 4-A, 5-L. N is in position 3, which is invalid (feedback said N is not in position 3). So BANAL is invalid.

Looking again for words with A in position 2 and N not in position 3:
- DANKY: N in position 3 (invalid).
- GANJA: N in position 3 (invalid).
- HANNA: N in position 3 (invalid).
- MANNA: N in position 3 (invalid).

Let’s try:
- N A _ _ _: NABOB (O is out), NAGAS (S is out), NAVAL (L is okay), NAKED (E is out), NAMBL (L is okay).
  - NAVAL: N, A, V, A, L → A is in position 2, N is in position 1 (allowed), V, L are new letters. This seems valid.
- _ A N _ _: BANAL (invalid), DANCE (E out), GANJA (invalid), HANNA (invalid), MANNA (invalid), VANQU (invalid).
- _ A _ N _: BANAL (invalid), DANKY (invalid), GANJA (invalid), HANNA (invalid), MANNA (invalid), VANQU (invalid).
- _ A _ _ N: BANJO (O out), DANKY (invalid), GANJA (invalid), HANNA (invalid), MANNA (invalid), VANQU (invalid).

The only valid word seems to be NAVAL:
- N A V A L
- A is in position 2 (✓).
- N is in position 1 (not position 3, so allowed).
- No R, O, S, E, P, I, C.
- Uses new letters V and L.

But wait, let’s check if there are others:
- N A M B L (not a word).
- N A B L E (E out).
- N A B L Y (Y is okay, but is NABLY a word? It’s archaic, but let’s check: NABLY means to take by force, but it’s valid in some dictionaries. However, it’s less common.)
- N A M B A (not a word).
- N A V A L seems the best.

Another candidate: D A N G Y (but A must be in position 2, so D A N G Y has A in position 2, N in position 3 (invalid), so no).

G A N J A: A in position 2, N in position 3 (invalid).

H A N D Y: A in position 2, N in position 3 (invalid).

So the only valid word seems to be NAVAL or NABLY.

Between these, NAVAL is more common and uses V and L which are new letters.

But wait, let’s think of another:
- T A N G Y: A in position 2, N in position 3 (invalid).
- B A N K S: S out.
- B A N K Y: Y is okay, N in position 3 (invalid).
- B A N K S: S out.

Another approach: use a word where N is in position 4 or 5.

- B A L L Y: A in position 2, N not present (but we know N is in the word), so invalid.
- B A N K Y: N in position 3 (invalid).
- B A N K S: S out.
- B A N G Y: N in position 3 (invalid).
- B A N K Y: same.

Let’s try:
- B A N K Y: N in position 3 (invalid).

Another candidate: D A N C Y: C out.

G A N G Y: N in position 3 (invalid).

H A N G Y: N in position 3 (invalid).

M A N K Y: N in position 3 (invalid).

V A N G Y: N in position 3 (invalid).

So it seems the only valid word is NAVAL.

But let’s verify:
- NAVAL: N A V A L
  - A in position 2 (✓).
  - N is in position 1 (not position 3, so allowed).
  - Letters used: N, A, V, L. No R, O, S, E, P, I, C.
  - Valid English word.

Thus, NAVAL is the best next guess.",Guess 3: NAVAL -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) A(✓) V(x) A(✓) L(x),FAIL

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C.

A popular starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters and has no repeating letters. This gives me the best chance to gather information about the secret word's composition.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of 'O' and 'E' which are very common.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it balances common letters and provides good coverage.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) : R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) : O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) : S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) : E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, S, E.
- The letter A is in the word but not in position 1.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter A (but not in position 1).
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Let’s think of common consonants and vowels that remain: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, I, U, Y, K, etc.

A good next guess would use other common letters while placing A in a different position. A word like “PLANT” comes to mind, but it has N and T which are common, and it places A in position 3. However, we might want to test more vowels or consonants.

Another candidate is “MANGO”, but it has O (already ruled out).

“BLOAT” has O (ruled out).

“LACED” has E (ruled out).

“DRAIN” has R (ruled out).

“BLAND” has N and D, but no new vowels/consonants.

“TABBY” has B, T, Y, but we might want more coverage.

“CABIN” has C, I, N, but no new letters.

“HAPPY” has P, Y, but repeats P.

“GAMUT” has G, M, U, T, but no new letters.

“LAKES” has E, S (ruled out).

“FATTY” has F, T, Y.

“PANIC” has P, N, I, C.

Let’s choose “PANIC”:
- Contains A (position 2).
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
- Uses P, N, I, C which are all new letters.

This seems like a good second guess to gather more information.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Common letters in English include: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C.

A popular starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters and has no repeating letters. This gives me the best chance to gather information about the secret word's composition.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of 'O' and 'E' which are very common.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it balances common letters and provides good coverage.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) : R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) : O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) : S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) : E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, S, E.
- The letter A is in the word but not in position 1.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter A (but not in position 1).
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Let’s think of common consonants and vowels that remain: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, I, U, Y, K, etc.

A good next guess would use other common letters while placing A in a different position. A word like “PLANT” comes to mind, but it has N and T which are common, and it places A in position 3. However, we might want to test more vowels or consonants.

Another candidate is “MANGO”, but it has O (already ruled out).

“BLOAT” has O (ruled out).

“LACED” has E (ruled out).

“DRAIN” has R (ruled out).

“BLAND” has N and D, but no new vowels/consonants.

“TABBY” has B, T, Y, but we might want more coverage.

“CABIN” has C, I, N, but no new letters.

“HAPPY” has P, Y, but repeats P.

“GAMUT” has G, M, U, T, but no new letters.

“LAKES” has E, S (ruled out).

“FATTY” has F, T, Y.

“PANIC” has P, N, I, C.

Let’s choose “PANIC”:
- Contains A (position 2).
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
- Uses P, N, I, C which are all new letters.

This seems like a good second guess to gather more information.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. PANIC → P(x) A(✓) N(-) I(x) C(x)
   - A is in the word AND in position 2 (✓).
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
   - P, I, C are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Fixed letter: A in position 2.
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, I, C.
- Letter N is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Remaining letters to consider (common ones): T, L, D, M, B, G, H, U, Y, K, F, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2.
- N somewhere except position 3.
- No R, O, S, E, P, I, C.

Possible patterns:
- _ A _ _ _
- N can be in positions 1, 4, or 5.

Let’s brainstorm:
- N A _ _ _ : e.g., NADIR (but I is out), NABOB (B and O are out), NAGAS (S is out), NAVAL (L is okay), NAKED (E is out), NAMBL (L is okay).
- _ A N _ _ : e.g., BANAL (L is okay), DANCE (E is out), GANJA (J is okay), HANNA (N is in position 3, but N can’t be there), MANNA (N is in position 3, but N can’t be there), VANQU (not a word).
- _ A _ N _ : e.g., BANAL (N in 4), DANKY (Y is okay), GANJA (N in 4), HANNA (N in 4), MANNA (N in 4), VANQU (not a word).
- _ A _ _ N : e.g., BANJO (O is out), DANKY (Y is okay), GANJA (J is okay), HANNA (N in 5), MANNA (N in 5), VANQU (not a word).

Looking at valid English words:
- BANAL: B, A, N, A, L → contains A twice, but A is already known to be in position 2. This would place A in position 4, which is allowed since we only know A is in position 2. However, we haven’t ruled out A appearing twice, but it’s a valid word.
- DANKY: D, A, N, K, Y → uses D, K, Y which are new letters, N is in position 3 (but N can’t be in position 3), so invalid.
- GANJA: G, A, N, J, A → N is in position 3 (invalid), invalid.
- HANNA: H, A, N, N, A → N is in position 3 (invalid), invalid.
- MANNA: M, A, N, N, A → N is in position 3 (invalid), invalid.
- VANQU: not a word.

Wait, let’s re-examine:
- BANAL: positions are 1-B, 2-A, 3-N, 4-A, 5-L. N is in position 3, which is invalid (feedback said N is not in position 3). So BANAL is invalid.

Looking again for words with A in position 2 and N not in position 3:
- DANKY: N in position 3 (invalid).
- GANJA: N in position 3 (invalid).
- HANNA: N in position 3 (invalid).
- MANNA: N in position 3 (invalid).

Let’s try:
- N A _ _ _: NABOB (O is out), NAGAS (S is out), NAVAL (L is okay), NAKED (E is out), NAMBL (L is okay).
  - NAVAL: N, A, V, A, L → A is in position 2, N is in position 1 (allowed), V, L are new letters. This seems valid.
- _ A N _ _: BANAL (invalid), DANCE (E out), GANJA (invalid), HANNA (invalid), MANNA (invalid), VANQU (invalid).
- _ A _ N _: BANAL (invalid), DANKY (invalid), GANJA (invalid), HANNA (invalid), MANNA (invalid), VANQU (invalid).
- _ A _ _ N: BANJO (O out), DANKY (invalid), GANJA (invalid), HANNA (invalid), MANNA (invalid), VANQU (invalid).

The only valid word seems to be NAVAL:
- N A V A L
- A is in position 2 (✓).
- N is in position 1 (not position 3, so allowed).
- No R, O, S, E, P, I, C.
- Uses new letters V and L.

But wait, let’s check if there are others:
- N A M B L (not a word).
- N A B L E (E out).
- N A B L Y (Y is okay, but is NABLY a word? It’s archaic, but let’s check: NABLY means to take by force, but it’s valid in some dictionaries. However, it’s less common.)
- N A M B A (not a word).
- N A V A L seems the best.

Another candidate: D A N G Y (but A must be in position 2, so D A N G Y has A in position 2, N in position 3 (invalid), so no).

G A N J A: A in position 2, N in position 3 (invalid).

H A N D Y: A in position 2, N in position 3 (invalid).

So the only valid word seems to be NAVAL or NABLY.

Between these, NAVAL is more common and uses V and L which are new letters.

But wait, let’s think of another:
- T A N G Y: A in position 2, N in position 3 (invalid).
- B A N K S: S out.
- B A N K Y: Y is okay, N in position 3 (invalid).
- B A N K S: S out.

Another approach: use a word where N is in position 4 or 5.

- B A L L Y: A in position 2, N not present (but we know N is in the word), so invalid.
- B A N K Y: N in position 3 (invalid).
- B A N K S: S out.
- B A N G Y: N in position 3 (invalid).
- B A N K Y: same.

Let’s try:
- B A N K Y: N in position 3 (invalid).

Another candidate: D A N C Y: C out.

G A N G Y: N in position 3 (invalid).

H A N G Y: N in position 3 (invalid).

M A N K Y: N in position 3 (invalid).

V A N G Y: N in position 3 (invalid).

So it seems the only valid word is NAVAL.

But let’s verify:
- NAVAL: N A V A L
  - A in position 2 (✓).
  - N is in position 1 (not position 3, so allowed).
  - Letters used: N, A, V, L. No R, O, S, E, P, I, C.
  - Valid English word.

Thus, NAVAL is the best next guess.

Current constraints after four guesses:

1. Word pattern: N A _ A _ (positions 1,2,4 are fixed).
2. Letters **not** in the word: R, O, S, E, P, I, C, V, L.
3. From NADAM feedback:
   - D is in the word but not in position 3.
   - M is in the word but not in position 5.

So the missing letters (positions 3 and 5) must be from the remaining alphabet excluding the banned letters. The remaining consonants include: T, B, F, G, H, K, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form N A ? A ? where:
- Position 3 is D or M (but D cannot be in position 3, M cannot be in position 5).  
- Position 5 must be a letter not yet ruled out.

Let’s list possible combinations:

- If position 3 = D (but D cannot be in position 3), skip.
- If position 3 = M (M cannot be in position 5), then position 5 must be a different letter.

Actually, the feedback only tells us D is in the word but not in position 3, and M is in the word but not in position 5. So D could be in position 5, and M could be in position 3.

So possible patterns:
- N A M A D  (M in 3, D in 5)
- N A D A M  (D in 3, M in 5)  → but D cannot be in 3, so invalid.

Thus the only valid word is N A M A D.

Check letters: N, A, M, A, D. All letters are allowed (none are in the banned list). And it fits the pattern N A _ A _.

NAMAD is a valid word (a type of ancient Egyptian fortress or palace).

Therefore, the next guess is NAMAD.
