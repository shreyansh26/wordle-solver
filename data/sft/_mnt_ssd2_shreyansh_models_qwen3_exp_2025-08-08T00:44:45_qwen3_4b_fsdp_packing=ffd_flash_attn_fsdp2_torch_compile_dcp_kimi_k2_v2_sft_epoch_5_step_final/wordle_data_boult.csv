### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common letters to maximize information gain.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeating letters. This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, regardless of their positions. Another strong contender is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a top starting word due to its high letter frequency.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it covers five very common letters and has no duplicates, which maximizes the information we can get from the feedback.

- O(-) – O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.

- We have no information about the other letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

A good next step is to pick a word that:
1. Uses the known letter O in a different position (not 3).
2. Uses other common letters not yet eliminated (e.g., T, L, N, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.).
3. Avoids the eliminated letters A, R, S, E.

Possible candidates:
- ""POINT"" – uses O, P, I, N, T. O is in position 2 (allowed), and P, I, N, T are common and untested.
- ""CLOUD"" – uses O, C, L, U, D. O is in position 2 (allowed), and C, L, U, D are common.
- ""MOULD"" – uses O, M, U, L, D. O is in position 2 (allowed), and M, U, L, D are common.

Among these, ""POINT"" seems like the strongest choice because P, I, N, T are all very common letters and haven't been tested yet. It also places O in position 2, which is a new position for O.

3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common letters to maximize information gain.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeating letters. This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, regardless of their positions. Another strong contender is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a top starting word due to its high letter frequency.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it covers five very common letters and has no duplicates, which maximizes the information we can get from the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, S, E.
- Letter definitely IN the word: O, but it must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- We have no information about the other letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

A good next step is to pick a word that:
1. Uses the known letter O in a different position (not 3).
2. Uses other common letters not yet eliminated (e.g., T, L, N, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.).
3. Avoids the eliminated letters A, R, S, E.

Possible candidates:
- ""POINT"" – uses O, P, I, N, T. O is in position 2 (allowed), and P, I, N, T are common and untested.
- ""CLOUD"" – uses O, C, L, U, D. O is in position 2 (allowed), and C, L, U, D are common.
- ""MOULD"" – uses O, M, U, L, D. O is in position 2 (allowed), and M, U, L, D are common.

Among these, ""POINT"" seems like the strongest choice because P, I, N, T are all very common letters and haven't been tested yet. It also places O in position 2, which is a new position for O.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(✓)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters definitely NOT in the word:  
A, R, S, E, P, I, N  

Letters definitely IN the word:  
O (in position 2)  
T (in position 5)  

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ T

We still need to fill positions 1, 3, and 4 with letters that:
- Have not been eliminated (i.e., not A, R, S, E, P, I, N)
- Are common English letters

Remaining high-frequency letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We want a word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Has T in position 5
- Uses only allowed letters for positions 1, 3, 4

Possible candidates:
- CLOUD → C, L, U, D – but O must be in position 2, so CLOUD doesn’t fit (it’s C-L-O-U-D).
- CLOUT → C-L-O-U-T → positions: 1=C, 2=O, 3=L, 4=U, 5=T → fits the pattern.
- GLOUT → G-L-O-U-T → also fits.
- HOMOT → not a valid word.
- BLOUT → B-L-O-U-T → valid word.

Among these, “CLOUT” is a common English word and uses three new common letters (C, L, U) while fitting the known pattern.

Let’s use CLOUT.

Let’s update what we now know from all feedback so far.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):  
A, R, S, E, P, I, N, C

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or -):  
- O is in the word and must be in position 2 (from POINT feedback).  
- T is in the word and must be in position 5 (from POINT feedback).  
- L is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from CLOUT feedback).  
- U is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from CLOUT feedback).

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ T with:
- Position 3 ≠ L
- Position 4 ≠ U

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 using only letters that have not been eliminated (i.e., not A, R, S, E, P, I, N, C).

Remaining high-frequency letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We also know:
- L must appear somewhere (it was marked “-” in CLOUT, so it exists but not in position 3).  
- U must appear somewhere (it was marked “-” in CLOUT, so it exists but not in position 4).

So the word must contain both L and U, plus O and T already locked in positions 2 and 5.

That leaves position 1 and position 3/4 to be filled with the remaining letters.

Let’s list possible words that fit _ O _ _ T, contain both L and U, and avoid all eliminated letters.

Possible positions for L and U:
- L in position 1, U in position 3 → L O U _ T → “LOUT?” but we need 5 letters, so “LOUT” is only 4 letters.
- L in position 1, U in position 4 → L O _ U T → “LO U T” → “LOUT” again only 4 letters.
- L in position 3, U in position 1 → U O L _ T → “UOLT” → not a word.
- L in position 4, U in position 1 → U O _ L T → “UO_L_T” → “UOL_T” → “UOL” is not a letter.
- L in position 3, U in position 4 → _ O L U T → “_OLUT” → “BOLUT” not a word; “GOLUT” not a word; “HOLUT” not a word; “MOLUT” not a word.
- L in position 1, U in position 3 → L O U _ T → “LOUT” again 4 letters.
- L in position 4, U in position 3 → _ O U L T → “OUL_T” → “BOULT” is a valid word (Scottish for “to make a bough” or “to cut”).  
  Check letters: B, O, U, L, T → none are in the eliminated set.  
  Check positions: O is in 2, T is in 5, L is in 4 (allowed), U is in 3 (allowed).  
  This fits all constraints.

Other possibilities:
- “FOULT” – not a common word.
- “HOULT” – same issue.
- “VOULT” – valid, but less common.

“BOULT” is a valid 5-letter word that fits every constraint.

Therefore, the next guess is BOULT.
