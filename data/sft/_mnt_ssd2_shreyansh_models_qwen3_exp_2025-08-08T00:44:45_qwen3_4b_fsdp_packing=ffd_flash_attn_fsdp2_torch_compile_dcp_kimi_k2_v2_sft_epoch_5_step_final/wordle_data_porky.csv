### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: very common consonant
- E: most common vowel

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter and position, or at least one letter that's in the word but in the wrong position.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a huge set of common letters.

Good candidates: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, M, P, Y, D, G, B, F, K, etc.  
I’ll try a word that uses several of these, keeping it a valid English word.  
One strong choice is “ROUND”:

From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)

2. ROUND → R(-) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(x)  
   ⇒ O is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).  
   ⇒ R is in the word but not in the first position.  
   ⇒ U, N, D are not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word has the form _ O _ _ _ (with O in the second spot).
- It contains R somewhere, but not in the first position.
- Letters still available (not yet ruled out): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus R, which we know is present).

I want a word that:
- Has O in the second position.
- Contains R somewhere else (positions 3, 4, or 5).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Let’s try “CHORI”:
- C, H, O, R, I – all letters are still possible.
- O is in position 2 (matches the feedback).
- R is in position 4 (not in position 1, so satisfies the feedback).
- No letters from SLATE or ROUND are used again.

This seems like a good candidate.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: very common consonant
- E: most common vowel

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter and position, or at least one letter that's in the word but in the wrong position.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a huge set of common letters.  
Now I need a fresh set of common consonants and vowels that weren’t used in SLATE.  
Good candidates: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, M, P, Y, D, G, B, F, K, etc.  
I’ll try a word that uses several of these, keeping it a valid English word.  
One strong choice is “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D – none of these were in SLATE, and they’re all fairly common letters.

From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ None of S, L, A, T, E appear in the secret word.

2. ROUND → R(-) O(✓) U(x) N(x) D(x)  
   ⇒ O is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).  
   ⇒ R is in the word but not in the first position.  
   ⇒ U, N, D are not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word has the form _ O _ _ _ (with O in the second spot).
- It contains R somewhere, but not in the first position.
- Letters still available (not yet ruled out): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus R, which we know is present).

I want a word that:
- Has O in the second position.
- Contains R somewhere else (positions 3, 4, or 5).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Let’s try “CHORI”:
- C, H, O, R, I – all letters are still possible.
- O is in position 2 (matches the feedback).
- R is in position 4 (not in position 1, so satisfies the feedback).
- No letters from SLATE or ROUND are used again.

This seems like a good candidate.
