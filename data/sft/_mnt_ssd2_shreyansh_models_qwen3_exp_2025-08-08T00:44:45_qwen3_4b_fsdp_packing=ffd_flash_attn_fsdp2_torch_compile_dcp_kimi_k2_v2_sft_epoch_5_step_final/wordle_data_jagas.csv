For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. 

Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it includes C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give me good information about which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word (all marked x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (marked -).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain C, R, N, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has A somewhere other than position 3.
2. Does NOT contain C, R, N, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

I’ll try a word like “SLAID”:
- S, L, A, I, D – none of C, R, N, E.
- A is in position 3 again, but we know A is not in position 3, so this is bad.

Next, “PLAID” – same issue with A in position 3.

Try “STAMP” – no A, so no info on A.

Try “MADAM” – has two A’s, but A is in positions 2 and 4, neither of which is 3, so this is valid. But it’s not great for information.

Better: “SALTY” – has A in position 2, and uses S, L, T, Y. No C, R, N, E.

From all feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)

2. SALTY → S(-) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)

So the secret word looks like:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. 

Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it includes C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give me good information about which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word (all marked x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (marked -).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain C, R, N, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has A somewhere other than position 3.
2. Does NOT contain C, R, N, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

I’ll try a word like “SLAID”:
- S, L, A, I, D – none of C, R, N, E.
- A is in position 3 again, but we know A is not in position 3, so this is bad.

Next, “PLAID” – same issue with A in position 3.

Try “STAMP” – no A, so no info on A.

Try “MADAM” – has two A’s, but A is in positions 2 and 4, neither of which is 3, so this is valid. But it’s not great for information.

Better: “SALTY” – has A in position 2, and uses S, L, T, Y. No C, R, N, E.

But let’s try “SALTY” first.

Wait, let me pick “SALTY” as it uses common letters and places A in position 2.

<|im_end|>

From the new feedback on SALTY:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (marked -).  
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).  
- L, T, Y are NOT in the word (all marked x).

So we now know:
- Position 2 is A.
- Letters in the word so far: A, S (but S is not in position 1).
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, L, T, Y.
- Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2.
- S somewhere except position 1.
- No C, R, N, E, L, T, Y.

Possible candidates:
- S in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Let’s try “S” in position 3: _ A S _ _
- Or “S” in position 4: _ A _ S _
- Or “S” in position 5: _ A _ _ S

Let’s pick a word that fits “_ A _ _ S” and uses common letters. “BAGOS” is invalid (O is okay but S is last). “PADDY” has T and Y excluded. “MAGUS” uses U and S in position 5.

But let’s try “MAGUS”:
- M, A, G, U, S – none of the excluded letters.
- A is in position 2.
- S is in position 5 (valid since S can be anywhere except position 1).
- G and U are new letters to test.

This seems good.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. 

Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it includes C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give me good information about which of these common letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are NOT in the word (all marked x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (marked -).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain C, R, N, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has A somewhere other than position 3.
2. Does NOT contain C, R, N, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

I’ll try a word like “SLAID”:
- S, L, A, I, D – none of C, R, N, E.
- A is in position 3 again, but we know A is not in position 3, so this is bad.

Next, “PLAID” – same issue with A in position 3.

Try “STAMP” – no A, so no info on A.

Try “MADAM” – has two A’s, but A is in positions 2 and 4, neither of which is 3, so this is valid. But it’s not great for information.

Better: “SALTY” – has A in position 2, and uses S, L, T, Y. No C, R, N, E.

But let’s try “SALTY” first.

Wait, let me pick “SALTY” as it uses common letters and places A in position 2.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SALTY -> FEEDBACK: S(-) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on SALTY:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (marked -).  
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).  
- L, T, Y are NOT in the word (all marked x).

So we now know:
- Position 2 is A.
- Letters in the word so far: A, S (but S is not in position 1).
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, L, T, Y.
- Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2.
- S somewhere except position 1.
- No C, R, N, E, L, T, Y.

Possible candidates:
- S in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Let’s try “S” in position 3: _ A S _ _
- Or “S” in position 4: _ A _ S _
- Or “S” in position 5: _ A _ _ S

Let’s pick a word that fits “_ A _ _ S” and uses common letters. “BAGOS” is invalid (O is okay but S is last). “PADDY” has T and Y excluded. “MAGUS” uses U and S in position 5.

But let’s try “MAGUS”:
- M, A, G, U, S – none of the excluded letters.
- A is in position 2.
- S is in position 5 (valid since S can be anywhere except position 1).
- G and U are new letters to test.

This seems good.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SALTY -> FEEDBACK: S(-) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)
Guess 3: MAGUS -> FEEDBACK: M(x) A(✓) G(✓) U(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.
   – C, R, N, E are not in the word.

2. SALTY → S(-) A(✓) L(x) T(x) Y(x)
   – A is now confirmed in position 2.
   – S is in the word but not in position 1.
   – L, T, Y are not in the word.

3. MAGUS → M(x) A(✓) G(✓) U(x) S(✓)
   – A is confirmed in position 2.
   – G is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
   – S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
   – M and U are not in the word.

So the secret word looks like:
_ A G _ S

Letters we know are NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, L, T, Y, M, U.

Remaining common letters to try: B, D, F, H, I, K, O, P, V, W, etc.

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4 that are not in the excluded set and form a valid 5-letter word ending in “AG_S”.

Possible candidates:
- BAGOS – but O is allowed and S is already confirmed in position 5.
- DAGHS – but H is allowed.
- FAGGS – but double G may not be necessary.
- HAGIS – H, I, S are allowed.
- KAGOS – K is allowed.
- PAGOS – P is allowed.
- VAGOS – V is allowed.

Looking at these, “HAGIS” is a valid word (a type of sausage) and uses H and I, both of which are still possible.

Let’s try HAGIS.

Current constraints:

1. Pattern: _ A G _ S
2. Letters known NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, L, T, Y, M, U, H, I
3. Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 4: B, D, F, K, O, P, V, W, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits “_ A G _ S” and uses only letters not yet excluded.

Possible candidates:
- BAGOS (B, A, G, O, S) – O is allowed, B is allowed.
- DAGOS (D, A, G, O, S) – D and O are allowed.
- FAGGS (F, A, G, G, S) – double G may be acceptable.
- KAGOS (K, A, G, O, S) – K and O are allowed.
- PAGOS (P, A, G, O, S) – P and O are allowed.
- VAGOS (V, A, G, O, S) – V and O are allowed.

Among these, “BAGOS” is a valid word and uses the remaining common letters B and O. It fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is BAGOS.
