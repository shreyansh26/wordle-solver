### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a strong first choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me good coverage of common letters and positions, helping me gather information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

Letters that are definitely in the word: A, R, O, H  
Letters that are NOT in the word: S, E, C, B, D  

Positions we have ruled out:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (from AROSE, ROACH, BOARD)  
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (from AROSE, ROACH, BOARD)  
- O is fixed in position 2 (✓)  
- H is fixed in position 5 (✓)  

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ H  
Available positions for A and R are 3 and 4, but we have to respect the positional bans.

- A can only be in position 4 (it cannot be 1, 3, or 4 in earlier guesses, so 4 is the only open slot left for A)  
- R can only be in position 3 (it cannot be 1, 2, or 4, so 3 is the only open slot left for R)  

Thus the word must be: _ O R A H  

The only missing letter is the first one.  
We have not yet tested the following common consonants: F, G, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.  
We want a letter that is common and has not been ruled out.  
Among these, F, L, M, N, P, T are all still possible.

A good candidate is “FORAH” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
“GROAN” – but N is in position 5, which is already H.  
“PROXY” – but Y is in position 5.  
“TORAH” – T is a common consonant and not yet ruled out, and TORAH is a valid word.

Let’s check:
- T is new and not ruled out  
- O in position 2 ✓  
- R in position 3 ✓  
- A in position 4 ✓  
- H in position 5 ✓  

So TORAH fits all constraints.
