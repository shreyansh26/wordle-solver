Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels and common consonants. 

Some good starting words include:
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - many vowels)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O - many vowels)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E - good mix)

I'll choose CRANE as it covers 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (C, R, N) in a good distribution.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
That means N must be in a position other than the 4th letter.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, or E.
- DOES contain N, but N is NOT in the 4th position.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains N but not in position 4.
2. Does not contain C, R, A, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good candidate letters to test next: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

A strong next guess would be STOIN (contains S, T, O, I, N) but STOIN isn't a valid word.  
Another option is STUMP (contains S, T, U, M, P) - but it lacks N.  
We need a word with N.

Valid word with N not in 4th position and avoiding C,R,A,E:
- STOIN (invalid)
- SLUMP (invalid, no N)
- PLUMB (invalid)
- STONY (invalid, has O and Y, but no N in wrong spot)
- STUMP (no N)

Wait, let's list valid words:
- STOIN - invalid
- STONY - has N in 4th position (invalid)
- STUMP - no N
- STINK - has N in 4th position (invalid)
- STONE - has E (invalid)
- STUMP - no N
- STOIC - has C (invalid)

Let's try SNOUT:

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels and common consonants. 

Some good starting words include:
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - many vowels)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O - many vowels)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E - good mix)

I'll choose CRANE as it covers 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 common consonants (C, R, N) in a good distribution.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are NOT in the word (x).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
That means N must be in a position other than the 4th letter.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, or E.
- DOES contain N, but N is NOT in the 4th position.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains N but not in position 4.
2. Does not contain C, R, A, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good candidate letters to test next: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

A strong next guess would be STOIN (contains S, T, O, I, N) but STOIN isn't a valid word.  
Another option is STUMP (contains S, T, U, M, P) - but it lacks N.  
We need a word with N.

Valid word with N not in 4th position and avoiding C,R,A,E:
- STOIN (invalid)
- SLUMP (invalid, no N)
- PLUMB (invalid)
- STONY (invalid, has O and Y, but no N in wrong spot)
- STUMP (no N)

Wait, let's list valid words:
- STOIN - invalid
- STONY - has N in 4th position (invalid)
- STUMP - no N
- STINK - has N in 4th position (invalid)
- STONE - has E (invalid)
- STUMP - no N
- STOIC - has C (invalid)
- STONE - has E (invalid)

Let's try SNOUT:
- S, N, O, U, T - all valid letters, no C,R,A,E.
- N is in position 2 (not 4) - satisfies the constraint.

SNOUT is a valid 5-letter word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SNOUT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) N(-) O(x) U(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)  
   – Eliminates C, R, A, E  
   – N is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. SNOUT → S(-) N(-) O(x) U(x) T(x)  
   – Eliminates O, U, T  
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   – N is in the word but NOT in position 2.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, O, U, T  
- Letters that ARE in the word: N, S  
- N cannot be in positions 2 or 4  
- S cannot be in position 1  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both N and S  
- Does not use any of the eliminated letters (C, R, A, E, O, U, T)  
- Places N in position 1, 3, or 5  
- Places S in position 2, 3, 4, or 5  

Remaining common letters: D, I, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Candidate words:
- SLIMY – uses S and N? No N.  
- SNIP – too short.  
- SLING – has N in position 4 (eliminated).  
- SLIM – too short.  
- SPIND – invalid.  
- SPIN – too short.  
- SPINY – has N in position 4 (invalid).  
- SPIND – invalid.  
- SPIND – invalid.  

Wait, let's list valid 5-letter words with N and S, avoiding the eliminated letters:

- SLIMY – no N  
- SLING – N in 4 (invalid)  
- SLIM – too short  
- SPIND – invalid  
- SPINY – N in 4 (invalid)  
- SPIND – invalid  
- SPIND – invalid  

Another approach: use N in position 3.  
Possible word: S _ N _ _  
Letters left: D, I, L, M, P, Y, etc.  

Valid words:
- SPIND – invalid  
- SLIMY – no N  
- SLING – N in 4 (invalid)  
- SLIM – too short  
- SLIMY – no N  

Wait, let's think differently.  
We need a word with N and S, avoiding C,R,A,E,O,U,T.  

Possible letters: N, S, D, I, L, M, P, Y, etc.  

Valid words:
- SLIMY – no N  
- SLING – N in 4 (invalid)  
- SLIM – too short  
- SPIND – invalid  
- SPINY – N in 4 (invalid)  
- SLIMY – no N  

Hmm, let's try N in position 1:  
N _ _ _ _ with S somewhere else (not 1)  
Possible: N _ S _ _  
Valid words:  
- NISPY – N in 1, S in 3, no eliminated letters.  
- NISPY – uses N, S, I, P, Y – all allowed letters.  
- NISPY – N in 1 (allowed), S in 3 (allowed), no C,R,A,E,O,U,T.  

This seems valid.
