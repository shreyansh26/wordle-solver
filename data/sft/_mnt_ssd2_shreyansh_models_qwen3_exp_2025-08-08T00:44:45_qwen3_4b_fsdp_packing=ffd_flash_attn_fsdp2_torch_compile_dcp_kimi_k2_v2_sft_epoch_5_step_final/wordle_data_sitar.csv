### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that can quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word with 5 unique letters that are all common. The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common starting letter)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us 5 different letters that appear frequently in English words, maximizing the chance of getting at least some hits in the feedback.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

From arose:  
A(-) → A is in the word but NOT in position 1  
R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 2  
O(x) → O is not in the word  
S(-) → S is in the word but NOT in position 4  
E(x) → E is not in the word  

From stars:  
S(✓) → S is in position 1  
T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 2  
A(-) → A is in the word but NOT in position 3  
R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 4  
S(-) → S is in the word but NOT in position 5  

So we have:

Letters confirmed to be in the word: S, A, R, T  
Letters confirmed NOT to be in the word: O, E  

Positions locked:  
- S is definitely in position 1  
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 4  
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3  
- T cannot be in position 2  

Remaining positions to fill: 2, 3, 4, 5  
We already have S in position 1, so the word looks like: S _ _ _ _

We still need to place A, R, T in positions 2-5, respecting their restrictions.

Possible placements:

- R cannot be in 2 or 4 → possible positions: 3, 5  
- A cannot be in 1 or 3 → possible positions: 2, 4, 5  
- T cannot be in 2 → possible positions: 3, 4, 5  

Let’s list all valid permutations of A, R, T in positions 2-5 that satisfy these constraints.

1. R in 3, A in 2, T in 4 → S A R T _  
   Need a 5th letter (must be unused and not O/E). Common unused letters: I, N, L, C, D, U, etc.  
   Possible: S A R T I → ""sarti"" (valid word?)

2. R in 3, A in 5, T in 4 → S _ R _ A → S T R _ A → S T R I A → ""stria"" (valid)

3. R in 5, A in 2, T in 3 → S A _ T R → S A I T R → ""saitr"" (invalid)

4. R in 5, A in 4, T in 3 → S _ _ T R → S A _ T R → S A I T R → same invalid

5. R in 5, A in 2, T in 4 → S A _ T R → S A I T R → invalid

6. R in 3, A in 4, T in 5 → S _ R A T → S I R A T → ""sirat"" (valid)

7. R in 5, A in 4, T in 2 → invalid (T cannot be in 2)

8. R in 3, A in 5, T in 2 → invalid (T cannot be in 2)

9. R in 5, A in 2, T in 3 → S A _ T R → S A I T R → invalid

10. R in 5, A in 4, T in 3 → S _ _ T R → S I R A T → ""sirat"" (valid)

11. R in 3, A in 2, T in 5 → S A R _ T → S A R I T → ""sarith"" (invalid, 6 letters)

12. R in 3, A in 5, T in 2 → invalid (T cannot be in 2)

13. R in 5, A in 2, T in 4 → S A _ T R → S A I T R → invalid

14. R in 5, A in 3 → invalid (A cannot be in 3)

15. R in 3, A in 4, T in 5 → S _ R A T → S I R A T → ""sirat"" (valid)

16. R in 5, A in 2, T in 3 → S A _ T R → S A I T R → invalid

17. R in 3, A in 5, T in 4 → S _ R _ A → S T R I A → ""stria"" (valid)

18. R in 5, A in 4, T in 3 → S _ _ T R → S I R A T → ""sirat"" (valid)

19. R in 3, A in 2, T in 5 → S A R _ T → S A R I T → invalid

20. R in 5, A in 2, T in 4 → S A _ T R → S A I T R → invalid

The only valid permutations I can find are:
- S A R T I → ""sarti"" (not a valid English word)
- S T R I A → ""stria"" (valid, plural of strion)
- S I R A T → ""sirat"" (valid, a type of Jewish commentary)

Between these, ""stria"" seems the most likely.

Let’s verify:
- S is in position 1 (✓)
- T is in position 2 (but feedback said T is in the word but NOT in position 2) → this is invalid!

Oops, I made a mistake. ""stria"" has T in position 2, which violates the feedback (T cannot be in position 2).

Next candidate: ""sirat""  
- S in 1 (✓)  
- I in 2 (new letter)  
- R in 3 (allowed, R cannot be in 2 or 4)  
- A in 4 (allowed, A cannot be in 1 or 3)  
- T in 5 (allowed, T cannot be in 2)  

This satisfies all constraints.

Another valid word: ""sart"" is 4 letters, so invalid. ""sarat"" has A twice, but we only have one A confirmed. 

Thus, the best next guess is ""sirat"".

- S T R I A → ""stria"" (valid, plural of strion)
- S I R A T → ""sirat"" (valid, a type of Jewish commentary)

Between these, ""stria"" seems the most likely.

Let’s verify:
- S is in position 1 (✓)
- T is in position 2 (but feedback said T is in the word but NOT in position 2) → this is invalid!

Oops, I made a mistake. ""stria"" has T in position 2, which violates the feedback (T cannot be in position 2).

Next candidate: ""sirat""  
- S in 1 (✓)  
- I in 2 (new letter)  
- R in 3 (allowed, R cannot be in 2 or 4)  
- A in 4 (allowed, A cannot be in 1 or 3)  
- T in 5 (allowed, T cannot be in 2)  

This satisfies all constraints.

Another valid word: ""sart"" is 4 letters, so invalid. ""sarat"" has A twice, but we only have one A confirmed. 

Thus, the best next guess is ""sirat"".",Guess 3: sirat -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) I(✓) R(-) A(✓) T(-),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that can quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good strategy is to use a word with 5 unique letters that are all common. The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common starting letter)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us 5 different letters that appear frequently in English words, maximizing the chance of getting at least some hits in the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x): O is NOT in the word
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4
- E(x): E is NOT in the word

So we know:
- Letters to keep: A, R, S (each is in the word, just misplaced)
- Letters to exclude: O, E
- Positions to avoid:
  - A cannot be in position 1
  - R cannot be in position 2
  - S cannot be in position 4

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, S
2. Does NOT contain O or E
3. Places A, R, S in positions they are NOT currently in
4. Uses other common letters to gather more info

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already used)

A strong candidate is ""STARS"":
- Contains S, T, A, R, S
- S is in positions 1 and 5 (it can't be in 4, so this is okay)
- A is in position 3 (it can't be in 1, so this is okay)
- R is in position 4 (it can't be in 2, so this is okay)
- T is a new letter to test
- No O or E

This tests:
- The placement of S, A, R
- The letter T

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

From arose:  
A(-) → A is in the word but NOT in position 1  
R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 2  
O(x) → O is not in the word  
S(-) → S is in the word but NOT in position 4  
E(x) → E is not in the word  

From stars:  
S(✓) → S is in position 1  
T(-) → T is in the word but NOT in position 2  
A(-) → A is in the word but NOT in position 3  
R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 4  
S(-) → S is in the word but NOT in position 5  

So we have:

Letters confirmed to be in the word: S, A, R, T  
Letters confirmed NOT to be in the word: O, E  

Positions locked:  
- S is definitely in position 1  
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 4  
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 3  
- T cannot be in position 2  

Remaining positions to fill: 2, 3, 4, 5  
We already have S in position 1, so the word looks like: S _ _ _ _

We still need to place A, R, T in positions 2-5, respecting their restrictions.

Possible placements:

- R cannot be in 2 or 4 → possible positions: 3, 5  
- A cannot be in 1 or 3 → possible positions: 2, 4, 5  
- T cannot be in 2 → possible positions: 3, 4, 5  

Let’s list all valid permutations of A, R, T in positions 2-5 that satisfy these constraints.

1. R in 3, A in 2, T in 4 → S A R T _  
   Need a 5th letter (must be unused and not O/E). Common unused letters: I, N, L, C, D, U, etc.  
   Possible: S A R T I → ""sarti"" (valid word?)

2. R in 3, A in 5, T in 4 → S _ R _ A → S T R _ A → S T R I A → ""stria"" (valid)

3. R in 5, A in 2, T in 3 → S A _ T R → S A I T R → ""saitr"" (invalid)

4. R in 5, A in 4, T in 3 → S _ _ T R → S A _ T R → S A I T R → same invalid

11. R in 3, A in 2, T in 5 → S A R _ T → S A R I T → ""sarith"" (invalid, 6 letters)

12. R in 3, A in 5, T in 2 → invalid (T cannot be in 2)

13. R in 5, A in 2, T in 4 → S A _ T R → S A I T R → invalid

14. R in 5, A in 3 → invalid (A cannot be in 3)

15. R in 3, A in 4, T in 5 → S _ R A T → S I R A T → ""sirat"" (valid)

16. R in 5, A in 2, T in 3 → S A _ T R → S A I T R → invalid

17. R in 3, A in 5, T in 4 → S _ R _ A → S T R I A → ""stria"" (valid)

18. R in 5, A in 4, T in 3 → S _ _ T R → S I R A T → ""sirat"" (valid)

19. R in 3, A in 2, T in 5 → S A R _ T → S A R I T → invalid

20. R in 5, A in 2, T in 4 → S A _ T R → S A I T R → invalid

The only valid permutations I can find are:
- S A R T I → ""sarti"" (not a valid English word)
- S T R I A → ""stria"" (valid, plural of strion)
- S I R A T → ""sirat"" (valid, a type of Jewish commentary)

- S is in position 1 (✓)
- T is in position 2 (but feedback said T is in the word but NOT in position 2) → this is invalid!

- R in 3 (allowed, R cannot be in 2 or 4)

- T in 5 (allowed, T cannot be in 2)  

This satisfies all constraints.

Another valid word: ""sart"" is 4 letters, so invalid. ""sarat"" has A twice, but we only have one A confirmed.

- T is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 5 (from stars, sirat)

So the word pattern so far is:

We still need to place R and T in positions 3 and 5 (since they can’t be elsewhere), and we also need one more letter (position 3 or 5) if we have only two letters left, but we have exactly two letters left to place: R and T.

But wait, we have five positions and we already have S, I, A fixed. We still need to place R and T plus one more letter (position 3 or 5). However, we only have two letters confirmed to be in the word (R and T). Therefore, the word must be S I R A T or S I T A R.

Check constraints:
- R cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4 → in S I R A T, R is in position 3 → violates constraint (R cannot be in 3)
- T cannot be in positions 2, 5 → in S I R A T, T is in position 5 → violates constraint (T cannot be in 5)

Therefore, the only remaining possibility is S I T A R:

- T in 3 (allowed, T cannot be in 2 or 5)
- A in 4 (✓)
