### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained from the feedback. The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any, so we can quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and any letters that are in the word but in the wrong place will give us additional information for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → O is somewhere else
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → S is somewhere else

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
- R is fixed in position 2.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Guess 2: CORNS → C(x) O(-) R(-) N(x) S(✓)
- C and N are not in the word.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (but we already know R is in position 2 from Guess 1, so this is consistent).
- S is in the word and now we know it’s in position 5.

So far we have:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ S
- Letters known to be in the word: R (pos 2), O, S (pos 5)
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, C, E, N

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with letters that are not A, C, E, N and must include O somewhere (but not in positions 2 or 3). Possible positions for O: 1 or 4.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- If O is in position 1: O R _ _ S
- If O is in position 4: _ R _ O S

We also need two more letters that haven’t been ruled out. Common remaining letters: D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try O in position 1: OR_ _S. Possible words: ORGYS (not valid), ORGAS (invalid), ORTHS (invalid). Not promising.

Try O in position 4: _ R _ O S. Possible words: B R I O S (invalid), D R O O S (invalid), F R I O S (invalid), G R I O S (invalid), P R I O S (invalid), T R I O S (invalid), V R I O S (invalid), W R I O S (invalid), Y R I O S (invalid). None seem valid.

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe O is in position 1 and we have OR_ _S. Let’s try ORGIS (invalid), ORGYS (invalid), ORTHS (invalid). Not working.

Alternative: Maybe the word is D R O _ S. Let’s try DROPS (but P is allowed). Let’s check letters: D, R, O, P, S. None of these are excluded except A, C, E, N. So DROPS is possible.

But we need to check if this fits:
- Pattern: D R O _ S → positions 1-5: D R O _ S
- O is in position 3 here, but from Guess 1, O cannot be in position 3. So this is invalid.

Next: Maybe the word is B R O W S. B, R, O, W, S. O is in position 3 again → invalid.

Try P R I O S. O is in position 4 → valid. Letters: P, R, I, O, S. None of these are excluded. This seems valid.

Let’s check: P R I O S → positions:
- 1: P (new)
- 2: R (correct)
- 3: I (new)
- 4: O (allowed, since O cannot be in 2 or 3, but 4 is allowed)
- 5: S (correct)

This seems to fit all constraints. Let’s use PRIOS.

But wait, PRIOS is not a common English word. Let’s think of more common words.

Alternative: Try G R I O S → GRIOS (invalid). Try T R I O S → TRIOS (valid plural of trio).

Check TRIOS:
- T, R, I, O, S
- R in 2, S in 5 → correct
- O in 4 → allowed
- No excluded letters (A,C,E,N)
- Common word.

So TRIOS seems like a good next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and any letters that are in the word but in the wrong place will give us additional information for subsequent guesses.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
- R is fixed in position 2.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Guess 2: CORNS → C(x) O(-) R(-) N(x) S(✓)
- C and N are not in the word.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (but we already know R is in position 2 from Guess 1, so this is consistent).
- S is in the word and now we know it’s in position 5.

So far we have:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ S
- Letters known to be in the word: R (pos 2), O, S (pos 5)
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, C, E, N

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with letters that are not A, C, E, N and must include O somewhere (but not in positions 2 or 3). Possible positions for O: 1 or 4.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- If O is in position 1: O R _ _ S
- If O is in position 4: _ R _ O S

We also need two more letters that haven’t been ruled out. Common remaining letters: D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try O in position 1: OR_ _S. Possible words: ORGYS (not valid), ORGAS (invalid), ORTHS (invalid). Not promising.

Try O in position 4: _ R _ O S. Possible words: B R I O S (invalid), D R O O S (invalid), F R I O S (invalid), G R I O S (invalid), P R I O S (invalid), T R I O S (invalid), V R I O S (invalid), W R I O S (invalid), Y R I O S (invalid). None seem valid.

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe O is in position 1 and we have OR_ _S. Let’s try ORGIS (invalid), ORGYS (invalid), ORTHS (invalid). Not working.

Alternative: Maybe the word is D R O _ S. Let’s try DROPS (but P is allowed). Let’s check letters: D, R, O, P, S. None of these are excluded except A, C, E, N. So DROPS is possible.

But we need to check if this fits:
- Pattern: D R O _ S → positions 1-5: D R O _ S
- O is in position 3 here, but from Guess 1, O cannot be in position 3. So this is invalid.

Next: Maybe the word is B R O W S. B, R, O, W, S. O is in position 3 again → invalid.

Try P R I O S. O is in position 4 → valid. Letters: P, R, I, O, S. None of these are excluded. This seems valid.

Let’s check: P R I O S → positions:
- 1: P (new)
- 2: R (correct)
- 3: I (new)
- 4: O (allowed, since O cannot be in 2 or 3, but 4 is allowed)
- 5: S (correct)

This seems to fit all constraints. Let’s use PRIOS.

But wait, PRIOS is not a common English word. Let’s think of more common words.

Alternative: Try G R I O S → GRIOS (invalid). Try T R I O S → TRIOS (valid plural of trio).

Check TRIOS:
- T, R, I, O, S
- R in 2, S in 5 → correct
- O in 4 → allowed
- No excluded letters (A,C,E,N)
- Common word.

So TRIOS seems like a good next guess.

From the three guesses we now have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - R is in position 2 (✓)
   - O is in the word but not in position 3
   - S is in the word but not in position 4
   - A and E are not in the word

2. CORNS → C(x) O(-) R(-) N(x) S(✓)
   - C and N are not in the word
   - O is in the word but not in position 2
   - S is in position 5 (✓)
   - R is in the word but not in position 3 (consistent with R being in position 2)

3. TRIOS → T(✓) R(✓) I(x) O(-) S(✓)
   - T is in position 1 (✓)
   - R is in position 2 (✓)
   - I is not in the word (x)
   - O is in the word but not in position 4
   - S is in position 5 (✓)

Current pattern: T R _ _ S

Letters known to be in the word: T, R, O, S
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, C, E, I, N

O must be in either position 3 or 4 (since it cannot be in 2, 3, 4 from earlier feedback – wait, let's re-examine):

From AROSE: O cannot be in position 3  
From CORNS: O cannot be in position 2  
From TRIOS: O cannot be in position 4  

So O must be in position 3.

Therefore the word is T R O _ S.

Now we need a valid 5-letter word that fits T R O _ S. The only common one is TROPS (but P is allowed), TROGS (invalid), TRODS (invalid), TROBS (invalid), TROYS (invalid). Actually, TROPS is a valid word (plural of trophic, or slang).

But let's check if TROPS is acceptable. T, R, O, P, S. None of these letters are excluded except A, C, E, I, N. So TROPS is valid.

Another possibility is TROPS, but let's see if there's another. TROPS is the only common one I can think of.

Therefore, the next guess should be TROPS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained from the feedback. The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any, so we can quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and any letters that are in the word but in the wrong place will give us additional information for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 2 is R
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → O is somewhere else
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → S is somewhere else
- E is not in the word (x)

So the pattern so far is: _ R _ _ _ with O and S somewhere in the remaining four positions (but not where they were in AROSE).

I need a word that:
1. Has R in position 2
2. Contains O and S somewhere else
3. Does not contain A or E

Possible candidates: 
- BLOSS (but has two S's, which might waste info)
- PROXY (has X, which is less common)
- CORNS (C, O, R, N, S) – uses common letters, places O in position 3 and S in position 5
- DROSS (but has two S's)
- CORNS seems best as it introduces new common letters (C, N) and places O and S in new positions.

Let's go with CORNS.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
- R is fixed in position 2.

- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Guess 2: CORNS → C(x) O(-) R(-) N(x) S(✓)
- C and N are not in the word.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (but we already know R is in position 2 from Guess 1, so this is consistent).
- S is in the word and now we know it’s in position 5.

So far we have:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ S
- Letters known to be in the word: R (pos 2), O, S (pos 5)
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, C, E, N

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with letters that are not A, C, E, N and must include O somewhere (but not in positions 2 or 3). Possible positions for O: 1 or 4.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- If O is in position 1: O R _ _ S
- If O is in position 4: _ R _ O S

We also need two more letters that haven’t been ruled out. Common remaining letters: D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try O in position 1: OR_ _S. Possible words: ORGYS (not valid), ORGAS (invalid), ORTHS (invalid). Not promising.

Try O in position 4: _ R _ O S. Possible words: B R I O S (invalid), D R O O S (invalid), F R I O S (invalid), G R I O S (invalid), P R I O S (invalid), T R I O S (invalid), V R I O S (invalid), W R I O S (invalid), Y R I O S (invalid). None seem valid.

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe O is in position 1 and we have OR_ _S. Let’s try ORGIS (invalid), ORGYS (invalid), ORTHS (invalid). Not working.

Alternative: Maybe the word is D R O _ S. Let’s try DROPS (but P is allowed). Let’s check letters: D, R, O, P, S. None of these are excluded except A, C, E, N. So DROPS is possible.

But we need to check if this fits:
- Pattern: D R O _ S → positions 1-5: D R O _ S
- O is in position 3 here, but from Guess 1, O cannot be in position 3. So this is invalid.

Next: Maybe the word is B R O W S. B, R, O, W, S. O is in position 3 again → invalid.

Try P R I O S. O is in position 4 → valid. Letters: P, R, I, O, S. None of these are excluded. This seems valid.

Let’s check: P R I O S → positions:
- 1: P (new)
- 2: R (correct)
- 3: I (new)
- 4: O (allowed, since O cannot be in 2 or 3, but 4 is allowed)
- 5: S (correct)

This seems to fit all constraints. Let’s use PRIOS.

But wait, PRIOS is not a common English word. Let’s think of more common words.

Alternative: Try G R I O S → GRIOS (invalid). Try T R I O S → TRIOS (valid plural of trio).

Check TRIOS:
- T, R, I, O, S
- R in 2, S in 5 → correct
- O in 4 → allowed
- No excluded letters (A,C,E,N)
- Common word.

So TRIOS seems like a good next guess.

Current pattern: T R _ _ S

Letters known to be in the word: T, R, O, S
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, C, E, I, N

O must be in either position 3 or 4 (since it cannot be in 2, 3, 4 from earlier feedback – wait, let's re-examine):

From AROSE: O cannot be in position 3  
From CORNS: O cannot be in position 2

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language to maximize the information gained from the feedback. The most common letters in 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any, so we can quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and any letters that are in the word but in the wrong place will give us additional information for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → position 2 is R
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → O is somewhere else
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → S is somewhere else
- E is not in the word (x)

So the pattern so far is: _ R _ _ _ with O and S somewhere in the remaining four positions (but not where they were in AROSE).

I need a word that:
1. Has R in position 2
2. Contains O and S somewhere else
3. Does not contain A or E

Possible candidates: 
- BLOSS (but has two S's, which might waste info)
- PROXY (has X, which is less common)
- CORNS (C, O, R, N, S) – uses common letters, places O in position 3 and S in position 5
- DROSS (but has two S's)
- CORNS seems best as it introduces new common letters (C, N) and places O and S in new positions.

Let's go with CORNS.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
- R is fixed in position 2.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 4.

Guess 2: CORNS → C(x) O(-) R(-) N(x) S(✓)
- C and N are not in the word.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (but we already know R is in position 2 from Guess 1, so this is consistent).
- S is in the word and now we know it’s in position 5.

So far we have:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ S
- Letters known to be in the word: R (pos 2), O, S (pos 5)
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, C, E, N

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with letters that are not A, C, E, N and must include O somewhere (but not in positions 2 or 3). Possible positions for O: 1 or 4.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- If O is in position 1: O R _ _ S
- If O is in position 4: _ R _ O S

We also need two more letters that haven’t been ruled out. Common remaining letters: D, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try O in position 1: OR_ _S. Possible words: ORGYS (not valid), ORGAS (invalid), ORTHS (invalid). Not promising.

Try O in position 4: _ R _ O S. Possible words: B R I O S (invalid), D R O O S (invalid), F R I O S (invalid), G R I O S (invalid), P R I O S (invalid), T R I O S (invalid), V R I O S (invalid), W R I O S (invalid), Y R I O S (invalid). None seem valid.

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe O is in position 1 and we have OR_ _S. Let’s try ORGIS (invalid), ORGYS (invalid), ORTHS (invalid). Not working.

Alternative: Maybe the word is D R O _ S. Let’s try DROPS (but P is allowed). Let’s check letters: D, R, O, P, S. None of these are excluded except A, C, E, N. So DROPS is possible.

But we need to check if this fits:
- Pattern: D R O _ S → positions 1-5: D R O _ S
- O is in position 3 here, but from Guess 1, O cannot be in position 3. So this is invalid.

Next: Maybe the word is B R O W S. B, R, O, W, S. O is in position 3 again → invalid.

Try P R I O S. O is in position 4 → valid. Letters: P, R, I, O, S. None of these are excluded. This seems valid.

Let’s check: P R I O S → positions:
- 1: P (new)
- 2: R (correct)
- 3: I (new)
- 4: O (allowed, since O cannot be in 2 or 3, but 4 is allowed)
- 5: S (correct)

This seems to fit all constraints. Let’s use PRIOS.

But wait, PRIOS is not a common English word. Let’s think of more common words.

Alternative: Try G R I O S → GRIOS (invalid). Try T R I O S → TRIOS (valid plural of trio).

Check TRIOS:
- T, R, I, O, S
- R in 2, S in 5 → correct
- O in 4 → allowed
- No excluded letters (A,C,E,N)
- Common word.

So TRIOS seems like a good next guess.

From the three guesses we now have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)
   - R is in position 2 (✓)
   - O is in the word but not in position 3
   - S is in the word but not in position 4
   - A and E are not in the word

2. CORNS → C(x) O(-) R(-) N(x) S(✓)
   - C and N are not in the word
   - O is in the word but not in position 2
   - S is in position 5 (✓)
   - R is in the word but not in position 3 (consistent with R being in position 2)

3. TRIOS → T(✓) R(✓) I(x) O(-) S(✓)
   - T is in position 1 (✓)
   - R is in position 2 (✓)
   - I is not in the word (x)
   - O is in the word but not in position 4
   - S is in position 5 (✓)

Current pattern: T R _ _ S

Letters known to be in the word: T, R, O, S
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, C, E, I, N

O must be in either position 3 or 4 (since it cannot be in 2, 3, 4 from earlier feedback – wait, let's re-examine):

From AROSE: O cannot be in position 3  
From CORNS: O cannot be in position 2  
From TRIOS: O cannot be in position 4  

So O must be in position 3.

Therefore the word is T R O _ S.

Now we need a valid 5-letter word that fits T R O _ S. The only common one is TROPS (but P is allowed), TROGS (invalid), TRODS (invalid), TROBS (invalid), TROYS (invalid). Actually, TROPS is a valid word (plural of trophic, or slang).

But let's check if TROPS is acceptable. T, R, O, P, S. None of these letters are excluded except A, C, E, I, N. So TROPS is valid.

Another possibility is TROPS, but let's see if there's another. TROPS is the only common one I can think of.

Therefore, the next guess should be TROPS.

None seem valid.\n\nWait, let’s think differently. Maybe O is in position 1 and we have OR_ _S. Let’s try ORGIS (invalid), ORGYS (invalid), ORTHS (invalid). Not working.\n\nAlternative: Maybe the word is D R O _ S. Let’s try DROPS (but P is allowed). Let’s check letters: D, R, O, P, S. None of these are excluded except A, C, E, N.

So this is invalid.\n\nNext: Maybe the word is B R O W S. B, R, O, W, S. O is in position 3 again → invalid.\n\nTry P R I O S. O is in position 4 → valid. Letters: P, R, I, O, S. None of these are excluded. This seems valid.\n\nLet’s check: P R I O S → positions:\n- 1: P (new)\n- 2: R (correct)\n- 3: I (new)\n- 4: O (allowed, since O cannot be in 2 or 3, but 4 is allowed)\n- 5: S (correct)\n\nThis seems to fit all constraints. Let’s use PRIOS.\n\nBut wait, PRIOS is not a common English word. Let’s think of more common words.\n\nAlternative: Try G R I O S → GRIOS (invalid). Try T R I O S → TRIOS (valid plural of trio).\n\nCheck TRIOS:\n- T, R, I, O, S\n- R in 2, S in 5 → correct\n- O in 4 → allowed\n- No excluded letters (A,C,E,N)\n- Common word.\n\nSo TRIOS seems like a good next guess.\n\n<guess>TRIOS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: CORNS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(-) R(-) N(x) S(✓)\nGuess 3: TRIOS -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(✓) I(x) O(-) S(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': ""From the three guesses we now have:\n\n1.

From the feedback on TRODS we learned that:

- T(✓) R(✓) O(✓) S(✓) are all in their correct positions.
- The letter D is **not** in the word (D(x)).

So the pattern is now fully locked in: T R O _ S.

We need a single letter for the 4th position that:
- Has **not** been ruled out (so not A, C, E, I, N, P, D)
- Forms a valid English word when placed in T R O _ S.

Common English letters still allowed: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Scanning the dictionary for 5-letter words matching TRO_S:

- TROGS – invalid (G is allowed, but not a common word)  
- TROPS – already tried (P ruled out)  
- TROYS – invalid  
- TROBS – invalid  
- TROWS – valid (plural of throw)  
- TROKS – invalid  
- TROHS – invalid  
- TROKS – invalid  
- TROUS – invalid (not a word)
