### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains five very common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This should give us good information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word and in position 2.
- O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and in position 5.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Letters confirmed: R (pos 2), E (pos 5)
- Letters confirmed present but wrong place: A (somewhere except pos 1), O (somewhere except pos 3)
- Letters eliminated: S

Next, I want to test new common consonants and vowels in positions we haven’t tried yet, while respecting the constraints. Good candidates for the remaining blanks are consonants like T, N, L, C, and vowels like I, U. I’ll try a word that places A and O in new positions and introduces new letters.

A good candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T (new letter, pos 1)
- R (already known pos 2 ✓)
- A (known in word, pos 3)
- I (new vowel, pos 4)
- N (new letter, pos 5)

This tests T, N, I while placing A in pos 3 and keeping R/E in their correct spots.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - R is fixed in position 2.
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S is not in the word.

2. TRAIN → T(-) R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
   - T is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is confirmed again in position 2.
   - A is now confirmed in position 3.
   - I and N are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ R A _ E
- Letters known to be in the word: R (pos 2), A (pos 3), E (pos 5), T (somewhere, not pos 1), O (somewhere, not pos 3).
- Letters not in the word: S, I, N.
- Remaining positions: 1 and 4.

Possible letters for positions 1 and 4:
- Position 1: cannot be A, R, E, S, I, N, T. Common remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
- Position 4: cannot be A, R, E, S, I, N, T, O. Common remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Since O must be in the word but not in position 3, it must be in position 1 or 4. However, position 3 is already A, so O can be in 1 or 4.

Let’s try to place O in position 4 and T in position 1 (since T must be in the word but not in position 1, so T must be in position 4, but position 4 is O, so that’s impossible). Wait, T cannot be in position 1 (from TRAIN feedback), so T must be in position 4.

But position 4 is currently open. Let’s check:
- If T is in position 4, then the word would be: _ R A T E.
- But O must be in the word, so O must be in position 1. That gives O R A T E.

Check if ORATE is a valid word: yes, it means to speak or pronounce.

Let’s verify:
- O in position 1: not ruled out (feedback only said O is not in position 3).
- R in position 2: ✓
- A in position 3: ✓
- T in position 4: new position for T (was in position 1 in TRAIN, now in 4).
- E in position 5: ✓
- All constraints satisfied.

Therefore, the next guess is ORATE.

1. AROSE → A(-) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - R is fixed in position 2.
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S is not in the word.

2. TRAIN → T(-) R(✓) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
   - T is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is confirmed again in position 2.
   - A is now confirmed in position 3.
   - I and N are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ R A _ E
- Letters known to be in the word: R (pos 2), A (pos 3), E (pos 5), T (somewhere, not pos 1), O (somewhere, not pos 3).
- Letters not in the word: S, I, N.
- Remaining positions: 1 and 4.

Possible letters for positions 1 and 4:
- Position 1: cannot be A, R, E, S, I, N, T. Common remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
- Position 4: cannot be A, R, E, S, I, N, T, O. Common remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Since O must be in the word but not in position 3, it must be in position 1 or 4. However, position 3 is already A, so O can be in 1 or 4.

Let’s try to place O in position 4 and T in position 1 (since T must be in the word but not in position 1, so T must be in position 4, but position 4 is O, so that’s impossible). Wait, T cannot be in position 1 (from TRAIN feedback), so T must be in position 4.

But position 4 is currently open. Let’s check:
- If T is in position 4, then the word would be: _ R A T E.
- But O must be in the word, so O must be in position 1. That gives O R A T E.

Check if ORATE is a valid word: yes, it means to speak or pronounce.

Let’s verify:
- O in position 1: not ruled out (feedback only said O is not in position 3).
- R in position 2: ✓
- A in position 3: ✓
- T in position 4: new position for T (was in position 1 in TRAIN, now in 4).
- E in position 5: ✓
- All constraints satisfied.

Therefore, the next guess is ORATE.",Guess 3: ORATE -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) R(✓) A(✓) T(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
