For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That immediately eliminates a huge set of possibilities, so we want a second guess that:
1. Uses none of those five letters.
2. Still contains a good mix of common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Letters already ruled out: C, R, A, N, E  
Remaining common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, B, G, K, P, F, Y, W, V, Z, Q, X, J.

A balanced second guess might be:
- S, T, L, I, O → SLIOT? (not a valid word)
- S, T, O, U, D → STOUT (valid word, contains S, T, O, U, D)

STOUT is a strong choice because:
- It introduces 5 new letters (S, T, O, U, D) that weren’t in CRANE.
- It tests common consonants (S, T, D) and the two most common remaining vowels (O, U).

Let's summarize everything we now know:

Letters definitely NOT in the word:
C, R, A, N, E, T, U, L, D

Letters that ARE in the word (but whose positions are still unknown):
S, O, I

Positions ruled out so far:
- S cannot be in position 1 (from STOUT) and cannot be in position 1 again (from SOLID), so S must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- O cannot be in position 3 (from STOUT) and cannot be in position 2 (from SOLID), so O must be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
- I cannot be in position 4 (from SOLID), so I must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We still need to test several common consonants and the remaining vowel Y (which is sometimes used as a vowel). Good candidates to try next are:
B, F, G, H, K, M, P, W, Y

We want a word that:
1. Contains S, O, I in new positions.
2. Introduces as many new common letters as possible.
3. Avoids every letter already ruled out.

A promising word is ""WISPY"":
- W, P, Y are all new letters.
- S, O, I are included in their new possible positions:
  – S is in position 2 (allowed).
  – O is in position 3 (but position 3 was ruled out for O in STOUT).  So O cannot be in position 3, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""FOIST""
- F, O, I, S, T
- T is already ruled out, so invalid.

Next: ""GOSPY"" – but G, O, S, P, Y
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 3 (allowed).
- G, P, Y are new.
- No ruled-out letters appear.

""SYMPH"" – but H is less common.

""YOUTH"" – but T and U are out.

""POSSE"" – E is out.

""POSIX"" – X is uncommon.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That immediately eliminates a huge set of possibilities, so we want a second guess that:
1. Uses none of those five letters.
2. Still contains a good mix of common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Letters already ruled out: C, R, A, N, E  
Remaining common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, B, G, K, P, F, Y, W, V, Z, Q, X, J.

A balanced second guess might be:
- S, T, L, I, O → SLIOT? (not a valid word)
- S, T, O, U, D → STOUT (valid word, contains S, T, O, U, D)

STOUT is a strong choice because:
- It introduces 5 new letters (S, T, O, U, D) that weren’t in CRANE.
- It tests common consonants (S, T, D) and the two most common remaining vowels (O, U).
- It’s a valid 5-letter English word.

From the two guesses we have:

   All five letters are absent from the secret word.

2. STOUT → S(-) T(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)  
   - S appears somewhere in the word (but not in position 1).  
   - T is not in the word at all.  
   - O appears somewhere in the word (but not in position 3).  
   - U is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, T, U  
- Letters definitely IN the word: S (somewhere except position 1), O (somewhere except position 3)  
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Remaining common letters to try: L, I, D, G, K, P, F, Y, W, V, H, M, B, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Use S and O in new positions.  
- Introduce several new, common letters.  
- Avoid any already-ruled-out letters.

A word that fits these constraints is “SOLID”:
- S is in position 1 (but feedback from STOUT only told us S is not in position 1; it could still be elsewhere).  
- O is in position 2 (new position).  
- L, I, D are all new letters.

Let’s verify:
- Letters in SOLID: S, O, L, I, D  
- None of C, R, A, N, E, T, U appear.  
- S and O are included as required.

Therefore, SOLID is a valid next guess.

Let’s consolidate everything we know after four guesses.

Letters **definitely NOT** in the word:
C, R, A, N, E, T, U, L, D, G, P, Y

Letters **definitely IN** the word (positions still unknown):
S, O, I

Position constraints:
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from CRANE, STOUT, SOLID, GOSPY).
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from STOUT, SOLID, GOSPY).
- I cannot be in position 4 (from SOLID).

So the remaining possible positions are:
- S: positions 2, 4, 5
- O: positions 1, 4, 5
- I: positions 1, 2, 3, 5

We still need three more letters (since we have three known letters S, O, I).  
We should pick three common consonants that haven’t been eliminated yet.  
Remaining common consonants: B, F, H, K, M, W, V, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that uses S, O, I plus two new consonants, obeying the position rules.

Candidate words:
- “WISPS” – but S repeats and P is out.
- “SWORD” – D is out.
- “SWOOP” – P is out.
- “SPOIL” – P, L are out.
- “SIXTH” – T, H are out.
- “SIXON” – N is out.
- “SIXTH” – T is out.

Let’s list possible placements:
We have to place S, O, I plus two new consonants.  
One straightforward arrangement is:
- Position 1: O (allowed)
- Position 2: S (allowed)
- Position 3: I (allowed)
- Positions 4 and 5: new consonants

A valid word fitting this pattern is “OSI**” + two consonants.  
Looking for a real word, “OSI**” is rare, but “OSI” + “K” + “M” → “OSIKM” is not a word.

Another arrangement:
- Position 1: S (not allowed, S cannot be 1)
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: O (not allowed, O cannot be 3)
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: I

This gives “I**S I”, but we need two consonants in the middle.

Try “WIS**”:
- W, I, S, ** – but we need O somewhere.

Let’s try “WIS” + O + consonant: “WIS O _” → “WISOK” is not a word.

Another arrangement:
- Position 1: I
- Position 2: S
- Position 3: consonant
- Position 4: O
- Position 5: consonant

A valid word: “IS**O _” → “ISKOW” is not a word.

Try “HIS**O _” → “HISMO” is not a word.

Try “FISH**” – but S is in 3 (allowed), O must be in 4 or 5.

“FISH**” + O + consonant → “FISHO” is not a word.

“FISHY” – Y is out.

“FIS**” + O + consonant → “FISOK” is not a word.

“MIS**” + O + consonant → “MISOK” is not a word.

“VIS**” + O + consonant → “VISOK” is not a word.

“WIS**” + O + consonant → “WISOK” is not a word.

“BIS**” + O + consonant → “BISOK” is not a word.

“KIS**” + O + consonant → “KISOK” is not a word.

Let’s try a different pattern:
- Position 1: consonant
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: consonant
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: consonant

A valid word: “BOSS_” – but S repeats.

“BOSSY” – Y is out.

“BOSS_” – not working.

“COSS_” – C is out.

“FOSS_” – S repeats.

“HOSS_” – not a word.

“MOS**” – O in 2 (allowed), S in 4 (allowed), I must be in 1, 3, or 5.

“MOS**” + I + consonant → “MO S I _” → “MO S I _” → “MOS I K” is not a word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That immediately eliminates a huge set of possibilities, so we want a second guess that:
1. Uses none of those five letters.
2. Still contains a good mix of common consonants and vowels to maximize information.

Letters already ruled out: C, R, A, N, E  
Remaining common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, B, G, K, P, F, Y, W, V, Z, Q, X, J.

A balanced second guess might be:
- S, T, L, I, O → SLIOT? (not a valid word)
- S, T, O, U, D → STOUT (valid word, contains S, T, O, U, D)

STOUT is a strong choice because:
- It introduces 5 new letters (S, T, O, U, D) that weren’t in CRANE.
- It tests common consonants (S, T, D) and the two most common remaining vowels (O, U).
- It’s a valid 5-letter English word.

Guess 2: STOUT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
   All five letters are absent from the secret word.

2. STOUT → S(-) T(x) O(-) U(x) T(x)  
   - S appears somewhere in the word (but not in position 1).  
   - T is not in the word at all.  
   - O appears somewhere in the word (but not in position 3).  
   - U is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, T, U  
- Letters definitely IN the word: S (somewhere except position 1), O (somewhere except position 3)  
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Remaining common letters to try: L, I, D, G, K, P, F, Y, W, V, H, M, B, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Use S and O in new positions.  
- Introduce several new, common letters.  
- Avoid any already-ruled-out letters.

A word that fits these constraints is “SOLID”:
- S is in position 1 (but feedback from STOUT only told us S is not in position 1; it could still be elsewhere).  
- O is in position 2 (new position).  
- L, I, D are all new letters.

Let’s verify:
- Letters in SOLID: S, O, L, I, D  
- None of C, R, A, N, E, T, U appear.  
- S and O are included as required.

Therefore, SOLID is a valid next guess.

Let's summarize everything we now know:

Letters definitely NOT in the word:
C, R, A, N, E, T, U, L, D

Letters that ARE in the word (but whose positions are still unknown):
S, O, I

Positions ruled out so far:
- S cannot be in position 1 (from STOUT) and cannot be in position 1 again (from SOLID), so S must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- O cannot be in position 3 (from STOUT) and cannot be in position 2 (from SOLID), so O must be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
- I cannot be in position 4 (from SOLID), so I must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We still need to test several common consonants and the remaining vowel Y (which is sometimes used as a vowel). Good candidates to try next are:
B, F, G, H, K, M, P, W, Y

We want a word that:
1. Contains S, O, I in new positions.
2. Introduces as many new common letters as possible.
3. Avoids every letter already ruled out.

A promising word is ""WISPY"":
- W, P, Y are all new letters.
- S, O, I are included in their new possible positions:
  – S is in position 2 (allowed).
  – O is in position 3 (but position 3 was ruled out for O in STOUT).  So O cannot be in position 3, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""FOIST""
- F, O, I, S, T
- T is already ruled out, so invalid.

Next: ""GOSPY"" – but G, O, S, P, Y
- O is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 3 (allowed).
- G, P, Y are new.
- No ruled-out letters appear.

So GOSPY is valid.

Another candidate: ""POSIT"" – but T is out.

""SYMPH"" – but H is less common.

""YOUTH"" – but T and U are out.

""POSSE"" – E is out.

""POSIX"" – X is uncommon.

""GOSPY"" seems best.

Let's check positions:
- G: new
- O: position 2 (allowed)
- S: position 3 (allowed)
- P: new
- Y: new

No conflicts. So GOSPY is a valid next guess.

Let’s list what we know after four guesses.

Letters **not** in the word:  
C, R, A, N, E, T, U, L, D, G, P, Y

Letters **in** the word (but positions still unknown):  
S, O, I

Positions ruled out so far:
- S cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 (from STOUT, SOLID, GOSPY feedback).  
  Therefore S must be in position 4 or 5.
- O cannot be in positions 2, 3 (from STOUT, SOLID, GOSPY feedback).  
  Therefore O must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- I cannot be in position 4 (from SOLID feedback).  
  Therefore I must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We still need to test other common consonants and the remaining vowel (none left except maybe Q, X, Z, but those are rare).  
Good candidates to try next: B, F, H, K, M, V, W, etc.

We want a word that:
1. Contains S, O, I in their still-allowed positions.
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
3. Introduces as many new common letters as possible.

Let’s try “WHISB” – but B is new, W is new, H is new, but we already have S, I, O.

Actually, we need to place S, O, I and fill the remaining two slots with new letters.  
A valid word that satisfies these constraints is “WHISB” – but let’s pick a real word.

A real word that fits: “WHISK” – but K is new, W is new, H is new, and we already have S, I, K.  
But we need to check positions:
- W: new
- H: new
- I: position 3 (allowed)
- S: position 4 (allowed)
- K: new

No conflicts with any previous feedback.

So the next guess is “WHISK”.
