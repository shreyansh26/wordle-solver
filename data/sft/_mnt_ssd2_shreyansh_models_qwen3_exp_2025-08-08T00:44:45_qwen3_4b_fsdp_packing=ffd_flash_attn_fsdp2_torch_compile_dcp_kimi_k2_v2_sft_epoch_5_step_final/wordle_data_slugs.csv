### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A balanced first guess that uses several of these common letters without repeating any is ""AROSE"". This word contains:
- A: very common starting letter
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: common consonant
- E: the most common letter in English

This gives us good coverage of vowels and consonants, helping us quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (-).

We now know:
1. The word contains the letter S, but S is not in position 4.
2. The letters A, R, O, E are excluded.
3. We still have no information about the other 11 letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Since S is confirmed to be in the word but not in position 4, we should try to place S in a new position (1, 2, 3, or 5) while introducing other common letters not yet tested. A good second guess would be ""STING"" because:
- It places S in position 1 (a new position).
- It uses T, I, N, G, which are all common letters not yet tested.
- It avoids all letters already ruled out (A, R, O, E).

This should give us maximum new information.

Let’s consolidate what we now know:

1. Letters confirmed NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, T, I, N  
   (from the two “x” marks).

2. Letters confirmed IN the word:  
   - S (and it is in the 1st position, because Guess 2 showed S(✓)).  
   - G (but it is NOT in the 5th position, because Guess 2 showed G(-)).

3. Letters still untested (and therefore still possible):  
   B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. Position constraints so far:  
   - Position 1 is S (✓).  
   - Position 5 is NOT G.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S.  
- Uses G somewhere other than the last position.  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (i.e., none of A, R, O, E, T, I, N).  
- Uses other common remaining letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “SHOGI”:
- Starts with S (✓).  
- Uses G in position 4 (allowed).  
- Uses H, O, I — but wait, O and I are already ruled out (from Guess 1 and 2). So “SHOGI” is invalid.

Try “SPUGN” – but N is ruled out.

This word contains:\n- A: very common starting letter\n- R: common consonant\n- O: common vowel\n- S: common consonant\n- E: the most common letter in English\n\nThis gives us good coverage of vowels and consonants, helping us quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).\n- S is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (-).\n\nWe now know:\n1.

From the new feedback on SLUGY:

- S is still ✓ (correct position, 1st letter).  
- L is ✓ (correct position, 2nd letter).  
- U is ✓ (correct position, 3rd letter).  
- G is ✓ (correct position, 4th letter).  
- Y is x (not in the word).

So the word is now known to be: S L U G _ (with the 5th letter not being Y).

Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, E, T, I, N, Y.

Letters still allowed (not yet tested): B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with SLUG and ends with one of the remaining letters. The most common remaining consonants are B, C, D, F, H, K, M, P, V, W.

Possible endings:
- SLUGB – not a word.
- SLUGC – not a word.
- SLUGD – not a word.
- SLUGF – not a word.
- SLUGH – not a word.
- SLUGK – not a word.
- SLUGM – not a word.
- SLUGP – not a word.
- SLUGV – not a word.
- SLUGW – not a word.
- SLUGX – not a word.
- SLUGZ – not a word.

None of these are valid English words. This means we need to reconsider: perhaps the word is SLUG plus a vowel that we haven’t ruled out. But the only vowels ruled out are A, E, I, O, U (Y is also ruled out). So the only remaining vowels are none; every vowel is ruled out.

This implies the 5th letter must be a consonant, but none of the common consonants form a valid word with SLUG. This suggests we might have missed an earlier test or need to re-examine.

Wait—let’s list all valid 5-letter English words starting with SLUG:
- SLUGG – not valid (double G).  
- SLUGS – valid (past tense of slug).  
- SLUGY – already tested (Y is x).  
- SLUGG is invalid.  
- SLUGS is the only valid word left.

Thus, the word must be SLUGS.

But let’s confirm: does SLUGS fit all constraints?
- Starts with S ✓  
- L ✓ (2nd)  
- U ✓ (3rd)  
- G ✓ (4th)  
- S in 5th position: not yet ruled out (only Y is ruled out for 5th).  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out: S, L, U, G, S – all allowed.

Therefore, the word must be SLUGS.
