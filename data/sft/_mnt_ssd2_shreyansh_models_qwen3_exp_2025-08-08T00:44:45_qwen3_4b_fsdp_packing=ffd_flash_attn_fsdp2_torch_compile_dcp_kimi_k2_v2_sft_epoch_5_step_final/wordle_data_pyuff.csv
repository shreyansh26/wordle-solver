### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that gives us the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help narrow down the possibilities. Common starting letters include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter in the word.

Another strong option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly effective due to its vowel-heavy composition. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess to maximize information gain.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large set of common letters.  
Now we need a 5-letter word that avoids A, R, O, S, E entirely and still uses other common consonants and vowels.  
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

Let’s extract the new information from the third guess.

CHUMP → C(x) H(x) U(✓) M(x) P(-)

- C, H, M are NOT in the word.
- U is in the word AND in the correct position 3.
- P is in the word but in the wrong position (it is in position 5, so P must be in positions 1, 2, or 4).

Forbidden letters so far:  
A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L, C, H, M.

Remaining letters (excluding the forbidden ones):  
B, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
plus the vowels U (already placed at position 3) and Y (sometimes a vowel).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has U in position 3.
- Contains P somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Let’s list possible patterns:  
_ _ U _ _   with P in 1, 2, or 4.

Try P in position 1:  
P _ U _ _  
We need two more letters from the allowed set.  
Good consonants left: B, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
A common combination is P + D + U + B + Y → “P D U B Y” → “PDU BY” isn’t a word.  
Try “P U B U C” – but C is forbidden.  
Try “P U B L Y” – L is forbidden.  
Try “P U B B Y” – B is allowed, but double B may be rare.  
“P U B B Y” is a valid word (slang for “pubby”).

Let’s check:  
P U B B Y  
- P is in position 1 (allowed, since P is only excluded from position 5).  
- U is in position 3 (matches ✓).  
- B, B, Y are all allowed letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that gives us the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help narrow down the possibilities. Common starting letters include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter in the word.

Another strong option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly effective due to its vowel-heavy composition. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess to maximize information gain.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large set of common letters.  
Now we need a 5-letter word that avoids A, R, O, S, E entirely and still uses other common consonants and vowels.  
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (Y is sometimes a vowel).  

A balanced choice that avoids all five excluded letters is “UNTIL”.  
- U, N, T, I, L: none of these letters were in AROSE.  
- It uses two new vowels (U, I) and three new consonants (N, T, L).  
- It’s a common word and gives us five fresh letters to test.

From the two guesses we know:

1. A, R, O, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
2. U is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — so U appears somewhere, but NOT in position 1.
3. N, T, I, L are NOT in the word (x).

So the remaining unused letters are:
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: I, U, Y (but I is already excluded, so only U and Y)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains U (but not in position 1)
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L

Let’s pick a word that uses U plus other common consonants. A good candidate is “CHUMP”:
- C, H, M, P are all new letters.
- U is in position 2 (not position 1), satisfying the feedback.
- No forbidden letters appear.

“CHUMP” fits all constraints.

Let’s update what we know after the fourth guess.

PUBBY → P(✓) U(-) B(x) B(x) Y(-)

- P is now confirmed in position 1 (✓).
- U is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).  
- B is NOT in the word (x).
- Y is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

Forbidden letters so far (from all guesses):  
A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L, C, H, M, B.

Allowed letters (positions 2, 3, 4, 5):  
D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
plus the vowel U (already known to be present somewhere).

Known constraints for the secret word:
1. Pattern: P _ _ _ _
2. U must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since it’s not in 1 or 2).
3. Y must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since it’s not in 5).
4. No forbidden letters may appear.

Let’s list possible positions for U and Y.

Case 1: U in position 2  
Then Y must be in 3, 4, or 5.  
Pattern: P U _ _ _ with Y in 3, 4, or 5.

Case 2: U in position 3  
Then Y must be in 2, 4, or 5.  
Pattern: P _ U _ _ with Y in 2, 4, or 5.

Case 3: U in position 4  
Then Y must be in 2, 3, or 5.  
Pattern: P _ _ U _ with Y in 2, 3, or 5.

Case 4: U in position 5  
Then Y must be in 2, 3, or 4.  
Pattern: P _ _ _ U with Y in 2, 3, or 4.

We need to pick a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try Case 2: U in position 3, Y in position 4.  
Pattern: P _ U Y _  
We need a consonant for position 2 and a consonant for position 5.  
Allowed consonants: D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that gives us the most information possible. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help narrow down the possibilities. Common starting letters include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter in the word.

Another strong option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly effective due to its vowel-heavy composition. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess to maximize information gain.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large set of common letters.  
Now we need a 5-letter word that avoids A, R, O, S, E entirely and still uses other common consonants and vowels.  
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (Y is sometimes a vowel).  

A balanced choice that avoids all five excluded letters is “UNTIL”.  
- U, N, T, I, L: none of these letters were in AROSE.  
- It uses two new vowels (U, I) and three new consonants (N, T, L).  
- It’s a common word and gives us five fresh letters to test.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the two guesses we know:

1. A, R, O, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
2. U is in the word but in the wrong position (-) — so U appears somewhere, but NOT in position 1.
3. N, T, I, L are NOT in the word (x).

So the remaining unused letters are:
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Vowels: I, U, Y (but I is already excluded, so only U and Y)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains U (but not in position 1)
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L

Let’s pick a word that uses U plus other common consonants. A good candidate is “CHUMP”:
- C, H, M, P are all new letters.
- U is in position 2 (not position 1), satisfying the feedback.
- No forbidden letters appear.

“CHUMP” fits all constraints.

Let’s extract the new information from the third guess.

CHUMP → C(x) H(x) U(✓) M(x) P(-)

- C, H, M are NOT in the word.
- U is in the word AND in the correct position 3.
- P is in the word but in the wrong position (it is in position 5, so P must be in positions 1, 2, or 4).

Forbidden letters so far:  
A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L, C, H, M.

Remaining letters (excluding the forbidden ones):  
B, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
plus the vowels U (already placed at position 3) and Y (sometimes a vowel).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has U in position 3.
- Contains P somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Let’s list possible patterns:  
_ _ U _ _   with P in 1, 2, or 4.

Try P in position 1:  
P _ U _ _  
We need two more letters from the allowed set.  
Good consonants left: B, D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
A common combination is P + D + U + B + Y → “P D U B Y” → “PDU BY” isn’t a word.  
Try “P U B U C” – but C is forbidden.  
Try “P U B L Y” – L is forbidden.  
Try “P U B B Y” – B is allowed, but double B may be rare.  
“P U B B Y” is a valid word (slang for “pubby”).

Let’s check:  
P U B B Y  
- P is in position 1 (allowed, since P is only excluded from position 5).  
- U is in position 3 (matches ✓).  
- B, B, Y are all allowed letters.  
- No forbidden letters appear.

This seems like a solid next guess.

Let’s consolidate everything we know so far:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word:  
   A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L, C, H, M, B (from PUBBY feedback).

2. Letters that ARE in the word:  
   - U (must be in position 3)  
   - P (must be in position 1)  
   - Y (must appear somewhere, but not in position 5).

So the word looks like:  
P _ U _ _  
with Y somewhere in positions 2 or 4.

Remaining available letters (excluding the forbidden set):  
D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need two more letters from this set to fill positions 2 and 4, with Y occupying one of them.

Possible combinations:  
- Position 2 = Y, Position 4 = any remaining consonant → P Y U _ _  
  Example: P Y U D _ → PYUD? Not a word.  
  P Y U G _ → PYUG? Not a word.  
  P Y U V _ → PYUV? Not a word.  
  P Y U K _ → PYUK? Not a word.  
  P Y U Z _ → PYUZ? Not a word.  
  P Y U D D → PYUDD? Not a word.  
  P Y U D G → PYUDG? Not a word.

- Position 4 = Y, Position 2 = any remaining consonant → P _ U _ Y  
  Example: P D U _ Y → PDU_Y? Not a word.  
  P F U _ Y → PFU_Y? Not a word.  
  P G U _ Y → PGU_Y? Not a word.  
  P K U _ Y → PKU_Y? Not a word.  
  P V U _ Y → PVU_Y? Not a word.  
  P W U _ Y → PWU_Y? Not a word.  
  P Z U _ Y → PZU_Y? Not a word.

Hmm, none of these combinations seem to form valid English words. Let’s check if we missed any letters or misread the feedback.

Rechecking PUBBY feedback:  
P(✓) U(-) B(x) B(x) Y(-)  
- P is correct in position 1.  
- U is in the word but NOT in position 3 (contradicts CHUMP feedback where U was ✓ in position 3).  
Wait! This is a contradiction. CHUMP showed U in position 3 as ✓, but PUBBY shows U in position 2 as (-). This means our earlier assumption that U is in position 3 is wrong. Let’s re-examine.

Correct interpretation of PUBBY:  
P(✓) U(-) B(x) B(x) Y(-)  
- P is correct in position 1.  
- U is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- Y is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the word is P _ _ _ _ with U somewhere in positions 3 or 4, and Y somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.

Forbidden letters:  
A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L, C, H, M, B.

Remaining letters: D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z, U, Y.

We need to place U and Y in positions 2, 3, 4, and fill the remaining slots with remaining consonants.

Possible patterns:  
1. P U _ _ Y  
   - Position 2 = U, position 5 = Y  
   - Need two consonants for positions 3 and 4 from D, F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
   Example: P U D G Y → PUDGY (valid word).

2. P _ U _ Y  
   - Position 3 = U, position 5 = Y  
   - Need two consonants for positions 2 and 4.  
   Example: P D U G Y → PDUGY? Not a word.  
   P F U G Y → PFUGY? Not a word.  
   P V U G Y → PVUGY? Not a word.  
   P W U G Y → PWUGY? Not a word.  
   P Z U G Y → PZUGY? Not a word.

3. P _ _ U Y  
   - Position 4 = U, position 5 = Y  
   - Need two consonants for positions 2 and 3.  
   Example: P D F U Y → PDFUY? Not a word.  
   P D G U Y → PDGUY? Not a word.  
   P D V U Y → PDVUY? Not a word.  
   P D W U Y → PDWUY? Not a word.  
   P D Z U Y → PDZUY? Not a word.

The only valid word we found is PUDGY (P U D G Y).

Let’s verify PUDGY against all feedback:

- P: ✓ in position 1 (matches PUBBY feedback)  
- U: in position 2 (- in PUBBY, but U is in word and not in position 3) – this is consistent.  
- D: new letter, not in forbidden set.  
- G: new letter, not in forbidden set.  
- Y: in position 5 (- in PUBBY) – this is consistent.

Thus, PUDGY fits all constraints.
