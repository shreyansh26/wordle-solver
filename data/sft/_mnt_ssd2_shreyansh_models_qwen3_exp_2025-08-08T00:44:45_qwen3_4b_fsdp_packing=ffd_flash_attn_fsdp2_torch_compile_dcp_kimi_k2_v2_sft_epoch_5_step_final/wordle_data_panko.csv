For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This should help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses:

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word (x):
R, S, E, F, M, Y, C, H, I

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or -):
- A: confirmed, but NOT in positions 1, 3, 5 (from AROSE, FOAMY, OCHIA)
- O: confirmed, but NOT in positions 2, 3 (from AROSE, FOAMY)

So the only possible positions left for A: 2 or 4  
The only possible positions left for O: 1 or 4  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and O
- Places A in 2 or 4
- Places O in 1 or 4
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (i.e., from the remaining alphabet: B, D, G, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z)

Let’s list possible positions for A and O:
1. O in 1, A in 2 → pattern: O A _ _ _
2. O in 1, A in 4 → pattern: O _ _ A _
3. O in 4, A in 2 → pattern: _ A _ O _
4. O in 4, A in 5 → pattern: _ _ _ O A (but A cannot be in 5, so discard)

So valid patterns: O A _ _ _, O _ _ A _, _ A _ O _

Let’s pick one of these and fill with allowed letters.

Option 1: O A _ _ _
We need two more letters from B, D, G, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z
A simple word: O A _ _ _ → OAKED (but E and D are allowed? Wait, E is ruled out. So OAKED fails because E is out.)

Next: O A N T _ → O A N T ? → OANT_ – no common word.

Option 2: O _ _ A _
Need letters for 2,3 from allowed set.
O B A N D – but A is in 3 which is invalid.
O B A N K – same issue.

Option 3: _ A _ O _
A in 2, O in 4.
We need letters for 1,3,5.
A common word: T A P O T – but P and T are allowed, and O is in 4. But TAPOT is not a valid English word.

Another: L A B O R – R is out.
G A M O T – M is out.
D A N O N – N is allowed, but DANON is a brand, not common word.

Next candidate: G A L O N – G, A, L, O, N – all allowed letters. Check positions:
G A L O N → A in 2 (allowed), O in 4 (allowed). No forbidden letters.

This seems valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This should help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains A and O.
- It does NOT contain R, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1, and O is not in position 3.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses A and O (since they’re confirmed in the word).
2. Avoids R, S, E.
3. Places A and O in new positions to test their correct spots.

A good candidate is “PLAID”:
- Uses A and O? No, O is missing.
- Next candidate: “COAST” – uses O and A, but S is excluded.
- “PAINT” – uses A but no O.
- “FOAMY” – uses A and O, avoids R/S/E, and tests new positions for A and O.

FOAMY:
- F, O, A, M, Y – all new letters except A and O.
- A is now in position 3 (was in 1 before).
- O is now in position 2 (was in 3 before).
- Tests F, M, Y which haven’t been tried.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: R, S, E, F, M, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word: A and O  
Positions ruled out so far:
- A is NOT in position 1 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 3 (from FOAMY).
- O is NOT in position 2 (from FOAMY) and NOT in position 3 (from AROSE).

So A must be in 2, 4, or 5; and O must be in 1, 4, or 5.

We need a word that:
- Contains both A and O.
- Places A and O in positions that haven’t been tried yet.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no R, S, E, F, M, Y).

Good unused letters left: B, C, D, G, H, I, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s try to place O in position 1 and A in position 4 to maximize new information.

A candidate word: OATEN  
- O in position 1 (new), A in position 4 (new).  
- T, E, N: E is already ruled out, so this fails.

Next candidate: OAKED  
- O in 1, A in 3 (but A cannot be in 3).  

Next candidate: OAKLY  
- O in 1, A in 3 (invalid).  

Next candidate: OVALS  
- S is ruled out.

Next candidate: OCEAN  
- C, E, N: E is ruled out.

Next candidate: OCHIA  
- C, H, I: all allowed.  
- O in 1, A in 5. Both positions are new for A and O.  
- No forbidden letters.

Let’s go with OCHIA.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear in many 5-letter words. This should help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains A and O.
- It does NOT contain R, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1, and O is not in position 3.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses A and O (since they’re confirmed in the word).
2. Avoids R, S, E.
3. Places A and O in new positions to test their correct spots.

A good candidate is “PLAID”:
- Uses A and O? No, O is missing.
- Next candidate: “COAST” – uses O and A, but S is excluded.
- “PAINT” – uses A but no O.
- “FOAMY” – uses A and O, avoids R/S/E, and tests new positions for A and O.

FOAMY:
- F, O, A, M, Y – all new letters except A and O.
- A is now in position 3 (was in 1 before).
- O is now in position 2 (was in 3 before).
- Tests F, M, Y which haven’t been tried.

Guess 2: FOAMY -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(-) A(-) M(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: R, S, E, F, M, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word: A and O  
Positions ruled out so far:
- A is NOT in position 1 (from AROSE) and NOT in position 3 (from FOAMY).
- O is NOT in position 2 (from FOAMY) and NOT in position 3 (from AROSE).

So A must be in 2, 4, or 5; and O must be in 1, 4, or 5.

We need a word that:
- Contains both A and O.
- Places A and O in positions that haven’t been tried yet.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated (no R, S, E, F, M, Y).

Good unused letters left: B, C, D, G, H, I, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s try to place O in position 1 and A in position 4 to maximize new information.

A candidate word: OATEN  
- O in position 1 (new), A in position 4 (new).  
- T, E, N: E is already ruled out, so this fails.

Next candidate: OAKED  
- O in 1, A in 3 (but A cannot be in 3).  

Next candidate: OAKLY  
- O in 1, A in 3 (invalid).  

Next candidate: OVALS  
- S is ruled out.

Next candidate: OCEAN  
- C, E, N: E is ruled out.

Next candidate: OCHIA  
- C, H, I: all allowed.  
- O in 1, A in 5. Both positions are new for A and O.  
- No forbidden letters.

Let’s go with OCHIA.

Guess 3: OCHIA -> FEEDBACK: O(-) C(x) H(x) I(x) A(-)

<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses:

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word (x):
R, S, E, F, M, Y, C, H, I

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or -):
- A: confirmed, but NOT in positions 1, 3, 5 (from AROSE, FOAMY, OCHIA)
- O: confirmed, but NOT in positions 2, 3 (from AROSE, FOAMY)

So the only possible positions left for A: 2 or 4  
The only possible positions left for O: 1 or 4  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and O
- Places A in 2 or 4
- Places O in 1 or 4
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (i.e., from the remaining alphabet: B, D, G, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z)

Let’s list possible positions for A and O:
1. O in 1, A in 2 → pattern: O A _ _ _
2. O in 1, A in 4 → pattern: O _ _ A _
3. O in 4, A in 2 → pattern: _ A _ O _
4. O in 4, A in 5 → pattern: _ _ _ O A (but A cannot be in 5, so discard)

So valid patterns: O A _ _ _, O _ _ A _, _ A _ O _

Let’s pick one of these and fill with allowed letters.

Option 1: O A _ _ _
We need two more letters from B, D, G, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z
A simple word: O A _ _ _ → OAKED (but E and D are allowed? Wait, E is ruled out. So OAKED fails because E is out.)

Next: O A N T _ → O A N T ? → OANT_ – no common word.

Option 2: O _ _ A _
Need letters for 2,3 from allowed set.
O B A N D – but A is in 3 which is invalid.
O B A N K – same issue.

Option 3: _ A _ O _
A in 2, O in 4.
We need letters for 1,3,5.
A common word: T A P O T – but P and T are allowed, and O is in 4. But TAPOT is not a valid English word.

Another: L A B O R – R is out.
G A M O T – M is out.
D A N O N – N is allowed, but DANON is a brand, not common word.

Next candidate: G A L O N – G, A, L, O, N – all allowed letters. Check positions:
G A L O N → A in 2 (allowed), O in 4 (allowed). No forbidden letters.

This seems valid.

Let’s update what we now know after four guesses:

1. Letters NOT in the word (x):  
   R, S, E, F, M, Y, C, H, I, G, L

2. Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or -):  
   - A: now confirmed in position 2 (✓)  
   - O: confirmed in the word but NOT in positions 3 (from AROSE), 2 (from FOAMY), 1 (from OCHIA), or 4 (from GALON)  
     ⇒ O must be in position 5.  
   - N: confirmed in the word but NOT in position 5 (from GALON)  
     ⇒ N must be in 1, 3, or 4.

3. Positions fixed so far:  
   - Position 2 = A  
   - Position 5 = O  

4. Remaining positions (1, 3, 4) must be filled with letters not yet ruled out.  
   Allowed letters (not yet eliminated): B, D, J, K, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z, N.

5. N must appear once in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Let’s list possible patterns:  
- N _ A _ O  
- _ N A _ O  
- _ _ A N O  

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits one of these patterns and uses only allowed letters.

- N _ A _ O: N B A D O (NBA is a prefix, but “NBA DO” is not a word)  
- _ N A _ O: B N A K O (invalid), D N A K O (invalid), T N A K O (invalid)

PANTO: P, A, N, T, O – all allowed letters, fits the pattern _ _ A N O.

Check positions:  
P (1), A (2), N (3), T (4), O (5) – N is in 3 (allowed), O in 5 (allowed), A in 2 (confirmed).

4. Position 5: O (✓)

Only position 4 remains unknown.  
From earlier feedback, we know:

- Letters NOT in the word (x): R, S, E, F, M, Y, C, H, I, G, L, T  
- Allowed letters for position 4 (not yet eliminated): B, D, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with “PAN” and ends with “O”.  
The only common word that fits is “PANJO” (a variant spelling of “panjabin”), but that’s obscure.  
The next closest and most common word is “PANDO”, but D has not been ruled out.

Check:  
P A N D O – all letters allowed, fits the pattern.

Therefore, the secret word must be PAN D O.",Guess 6: PANDO -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) A(✓) N(✓) D(x) O(✓),FAIL
