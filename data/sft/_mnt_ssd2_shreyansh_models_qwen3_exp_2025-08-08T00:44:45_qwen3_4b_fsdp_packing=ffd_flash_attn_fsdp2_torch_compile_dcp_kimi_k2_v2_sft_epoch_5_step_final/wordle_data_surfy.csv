### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information I get. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter and position, or at least identifying which letters are in the word.

Let me choose ""FRISK"" as it uses R in position 2 (different from before) and S in position 4 (different from before), and introduces F, I, K which are common letters.

From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - R is in the word but not in position 2
   - S is in the word but not in position 4
   - A, O, E are not in the word

2. frisk → F(-) R(-) I(x) S(-) K(x)
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (same as before)
   - S is in the word but not in position 4 (same as before)
   - F is in the word but not in position 1
   - I and K are not in the word

So we know:
- Letters in the word: R, S, F
- Letters not in the word: A, O, E, I, K
- R cannot be in position 2
- S cannot be in position 4
- F cannot be in position 1

We need a 5-letter word that contains R, S, F and avoids the excluded letters. The remaining vowels are U and Y (sometimes). Let's try to place R, S, F in valid positions.

Possible positions:
- R can be in 1, 3, 4, 5
- S can be in 1, 2, 3, 5
- F can be in 2, 3, 4, 5

Let's try a word that uses R, S, F plus two other letters (from remaining pool: U, Y, D, L, M, N, T, etc.). A good candidate is ""SURFY"" but Y is sometimes a vowel, and we don't know. Alternatively, ""FRUST"" - but T is allowed. Let me think of a word that fits.

Another approach: ""FRUST"" - but U is allowed, T is allowed. However, let's check positions:
- F in position 1 is invalid (from frisk feedback)
- So F must be in 2,3,4,5

Let's try ""SURF"" but it's 4 letters. Need 5. ""SURFY"" - but Y is sometimes vowel. ""SURGE"" - but E is excluded. ""SURFY"" seems possible, but let's see.

Actually, let's try ""FRUST"" - but F can't be in 1. So ""FRUST"" is invalid.

Another candidate: ""RUSTY"" - but T and Y are allowed. Check positions:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- U in position 2 (allowed)
- S in position 3 (allowed)
- T in position 4 (allowed)
- Y in position 5 (allowed)
This uses R, S, F? No, F is missing. Need to include F.

Let's try ""FRUST"" - but F can't be in 1. ""FRUST"" is invalid.

Next candidate: ""SURFY"" - but F is in position 4 (allowed), S in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed). This uses R, S, F plus U, Y. This seems valid.

But let's check if ""SURFY"" is a valid word - yes, it's an informal term for a surfer's board or a type of fish. However, in Wordle, it's not a valid word. Let me think of a better word.

Alternative: ""FRUST"" - invalid (F in 1). ""FRUIT"" - but I is excluded. ""FROND"" - but N, D allowed. However, it doesn't contain S.

We need a word with R, S, F. Let's try ""FRYS"" - but 4 letters. ""FRYSS"" - invalid.

Another approach: ""SURFY"" is problematic. Let's try ""FRUST"" - invalid. Maybe ""FRUST"" isn't the right path.

Let me think of a word with R, S, F in valid positions. For example:
- R in 1, S in 2, F in 3, plus two other letters: ""RSF??""
But that's not helpful.

Alternative: ""RUSTY"" - missing F. ""FRUIT"" - missing S. ""FROND"" - missing S. ""FRUIT"" - I excluded.

Wait, we need to include F, R, S. Let's try ""SURFY"" - but F is in 4, S in 2, R in 1. This seems the best option despite the informal term. Alternatively, ""SURFY"" might not be valid. Let me think of ""SURFY"" as acceptable for now.

But let's try ""FRUST"" - invalid. ""FRUST"" is invalid because F can't be in 1.
