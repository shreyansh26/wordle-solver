### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. 

Some good first guesses include:
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a common word and contains 5 of the most frequent letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.

- O(-) – O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, or E.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses O and S in different positions.
2. Avoids A, R, E.
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels to test.

Good candidates:
- SWORD – uses S, O, W, R, D (but R is ruled out)
- SLOTH – uses S, O, L, T, H (but O is in position 2, S in position 1)
- SPOIL – uses S, P, O, I, L (but O is in position 3, which is ruled out)
- SLOTH – O in position 2, S in position 1 (both allowed)

I’ll choose SLOTH because:
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since S was only ruled out of position 4).

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S.
- Does NOT contain A, R, E, T, H.
- S is NOT in positions 1 or 4.
- O is NOT in position 3.
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2.

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus O, S, L.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses O and S in positions different from 3 and 4 respectively, and not 1 or 4 for S.
- Uses L in a position other than 2.
- Avoids A, R, E, T, H.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out).
Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5 (since 3 is ruled out).
Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4, 5 (since 2 is ruled out).

Let me try a word that places S in position 2, O in position 1, and L in position 3. The remaining letters should be from the allowed set. A good candidate is ""OSLID"" but that's not a valid word. 

Another approach: ""SOLID"" – but O is in position 2, S in position 1 (invalid for S). 

""FOSSIL"" is 6 letters. 

""POSSE"" – but E is excluded. 

""LOSSY"" – but Y is allowed, but O is in position 2, S in position 1 (invalid for S).

""LOSIN"" – but I is allowed, N is allowed. Check positions:
- L in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 2 (allowed)
- S in position 3 (allowed)
- I in position 4 (allowed)
- N in position 5 (allowed)

""LOSIN"" is a valid word (means to make a noise). 

But let me verify: L is in position 1 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), S in position 3 (allowed), I in position 4 (allowed), N in position 5 (allowed). 

This seems valid. 

However, ""LOSIN"" might not be common. Let me think of another. 

""OSLIM"" – but M is allowed. 

""OSLIM"" – O in 1, S in 2, L in 3, I in 4, M in 5. 

This is valid. 

But ""LOSIN"" might be better. 

Alternatively, ""SOLIN"" – but S in position 1 is invalid. 

""OSLIN"" – O in 1, S in 2, L in 3, I in 4, N in 5.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, or E.
- DOES contain O and S, but neither is in its current position (O not in position 3, S not in position 4).

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses O and S in different positions.
2. Avoids A, R, E.
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels to test.

Good candidates:
- SWORD – uses S, O, W, R, D (but R is ruled out)
- SLOTH – uses S, O, L, T, H (but O is in position 2, S in position 1)
- SPOIL – uses S, P, O, I, L (but O is in position 3, which is ruled out)
- SLOTH – O in position 2, S in position 1 (both allowed)

I’ll choose SLOTH because:
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since S was only ruled out of position 4).
- O is in position 2 (allowed, since O was only ruled out of position 3).
- Introduces L, T, H to test new letters.
- Avoids A, R, E.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - A, R, E are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. SLOTH → S(-) L(-) O(-) T(x) H(x)
   - T and H are not in the word.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3 (confirms earlier info).

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S.
- Does NOT contain A, R, E, T, H.
- S is NOT in positions 1 or 4.
- O is NOT in position 3.
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2.

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus O, S, L.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses O and S in positions different from 3 and 4 respectively, and not 1 or 4 for S.
- Uses L in a position other than 2.
- Avoids A, R, E, T, H.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out).
Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4, 5 (since 3 is ruled out).
Possible positions for L: 1, 3, 4, 5 (since 2 is ruled out).

Let me try a word that places S in position 2, O in position 1, and L in position 3. The remaining letters should be from the allowed set. A good candidate is ""OSLID"" but that's not a valid word. 

Another approach: ""SOLID"" – but O is in position 2, S in position 1 (invalid for S). 

""FOSSIL"" is 6 letters. 

""POSSE"" – but E is excluded. 

""LOSSY"" – but Y is allowed, but O is in position 2, S in position 1 (invalid for S).

""LOSIN"" – but I is allowed, N is allowed. Check positions:
- L in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 2 (allowed)
- S in position 3 (allowed)
- I in position 4 (allowed)
- N in position 5 (allowed)

""LOSIN"" is a valid word (means to make a noise). 

But let me verify: L is in position 1 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), S in position 3 (allowed), I in position 4 (allowed), N in position 5 (allowed). 

This seems valid. 

However, ""LOSIN"" might not be common. Let me think of another. 

""OSLIM"" – but M is allowed. 

""OSLIM"" – O in 1, S in 2, L in 3, I in 4, M in 5. 

This is valid. 

But ""LOSIN"" might be better. 

Alternatively, ""SOLIN"" – but S in position 1 is invalid. 

""OSLIN"" – O in 1, S in 2, L in 3, I in 4, N in 5. 

This seems valid. 

I'll go with ""OSLIN"" as it's a valid word and fits all constraints.
