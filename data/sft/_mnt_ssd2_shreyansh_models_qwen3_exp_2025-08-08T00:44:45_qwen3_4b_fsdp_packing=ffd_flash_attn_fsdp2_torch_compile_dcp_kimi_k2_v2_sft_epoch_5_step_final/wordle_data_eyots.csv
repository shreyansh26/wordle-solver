### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains several common consonants (C, R, N) and the vowel A, which can help eliminate or confirm many letters early on. This gives me a broad coverage of the alphabet to start narrowing down possibilities.

Let’s summarize what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, L  
Letters in the word but in the wrong positions: S, T, E  
Letters in the word AND in the correct position: O (position 3)

So the secret word has the form: _ _ O _ _  
and must contain S, T, E somewhere in positions 1-2 or 4-5 (since they’re marked “wrong position” in STOLE).

Remaining unused common letters: D, I, U, Y, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, W, V, etc.

I need a word that:
1. Has O in position 3.
2. Uses S, T, E in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.
3. Uses none of the eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, L).

A quick scan of common 5-letter words fitting _ _ O _ _ and containing S, T, E gives “STOKE”:
- S in position 1 (possible since S was in position 1 in STOLE and marked “wrong position”).
- T in position 2 (possible since T was in position 2 in STOLE and marked “wrong position”).
- O in position 3 (matches ✓).
- K is a new letter.
- E in position 5 (possible since E was in position 5 in CRANE and marked “wrong position”).

This seems like a good next guess to test S, T, E in new positions while keeping O fixed.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains several common consonants (C, R, N) and the vowel A, which can help eliminate or confirm many letters early on. This gives me a broad coverage of the alphabet to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, N are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
  Since E was in position 5, the secret word must contain an E somewhere else (positions 1-4).

I now want a word that:
1. Uses none of C, R, A, N.
2. Places E in one of positions 1-4.
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels.

Good remaining high-frequency consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, H, G, B, F.
Vowels left to test: I, O, U, Y.

A balanced choice is “STOLE”:
- S, T, O, L are new letters.
- E is moved to position 4 (a common vowel/consonant placement).
- It covers 4 new letters and re-uses E in a new spot.

Let’s summarize what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, L  
Letters in the word but in the wrong positions: S, T, E  
Letters in the word AND in the correct position: O (position 3)

So the secret word has the form: _ _ O _ _  
and must contain S, T, E somewhere in positions 1-2 or 4-5 (since they’re marked “wrong position” in STOLE).

Remaining unused common letters: D, I, U, Y, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, W, V, etc.

I need a word that:
1. Has O in position 3.
2. Uses S, T, E in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.
3. Uses none of the eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, L).

A quick scan of common 5-letter words fitting _ _ O _ _ and containing S, T, E gives “STOKE”:
- S in position 1 (possible since S was in position 1 in STOLE and marked “wrong position”).
- T in position 2 (possible since T was in position 2 in STOLE and marked “wrong position”).
- O in position 3 (matches ✓).
- K is a new letter.
- E in position 5 (possible since E was in position 5 in CRANE and marked “wrong position”).

This seems like a good next guess to test S, T, E in new positions while keeping O fixed.

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, L, K, V
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S, T, E
- O is fixed in position 3.

So the word must contain S, T, E exactly once each, plus O in position 3, and none of the forbidden letters.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ _ O _ _ that contains S, T, E in some permutation of positions 1, 2, 4, 5.

Possible permutations of S, T, E among positions 1,2,4,5:
- S, T, E must occupy three of these four positions, leaving one position blank (but we already have O in position 3).

Let’s list possible words:
- E S T O _ – no valid word
- E S _ O T – no valid word
- E _ S O T – “ESOT” is not a word
- _ E S O T – “E” is already used, “ESOT” is not valid
- _ S E O T – “S” is already used, “SEOT” is not valid
- _ S _ O E – “S” is already used, “S” again would be duplicate

- E S O T _ – “ESOT” not valid
- E _ O S T – “E” is already used, “EOS T” not valid
- _ E O S T – “EOS T” not valid
- _ _ O S T – “OST” not valid

Wait, let’s try a different approach. The word must be _ _ O _ _ with S, T, E in positions 1,2,4,5 without duplicates.

Possible valid words:
- “E” can’t be in position 1 because we have S, T, E to place.
- “O” is fixed in position 3.
- Let’s list all 5-letter words ending in “O _ _” and containing S, T, E.

Actually, the pattern is _ _ O _ _. Let’s think of words like “DOES”, but we need 5 letters.

Let’s try “DOES” – no, it’s 4 letters.
“DOESY” – 5 letters, but Y is not yet eliminated.

- “S” must be in 1,2,4,5
- “T” must be in 1,2,4,5
- “E” must be in 1,2,4,5
- O is in 3

Possible valid words:
- “SOFT” – but we need 5 letters.
- “STOPE” – but “P” is not yet eliminated.
- “STOPE” is 5 letters: S T O P E
  - S in 1, T in 2, O in 3, P in 4, E in 5
  - Check letters: S, T, O, P, E – none of C, R, A, N, L, K, V are present
  - Contains S, T, E plus O
  - This seems valid.

Another candidate: “STEIN” – but N is eliminated.
“STEIN” – N is eliminated (from CRANE feedback), so no.
“STEPP” – duplicate P, not valid.
“STOIC” – C is eliminated.
“STOKE” – K is eliminated.
“STOLE” – L is eliminated.
“STOPE” seems the only valid one left.

Let’s verify:
- STOPE: S T O P E
  - S: in word, position 1 (was 1 in STOLE, now new spot)
  - T: in word, position 2 (was 2 in STOLE, now new spot)
  - O: in word, position 3 (✓)
  - P: new letter

  Since E was in position 5, the secret word must contain an E somewhere else (positions 1-4).

I now want a word that:
1. Uses none of C, R, A, N.
2. Places E in one of positions 1-4.
3. Introduces new common consonants and vowels.

Good remaining high-frequency consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, H, G, B, F.
Vowels left to test: I, O, U, Y.

A balanced choice is “STOLE”:
- S, T, O, L are new letters.
- E is moved to position 4 (a common vowel/consonant placement).
- It covers 4 new letters and re-uses E in a new spot.

Let’s summarize what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, L  
Letters in the word but in the wrong positions: S, T, E  
Letters in the word AND in the correct position: O (position 3)

So the secret word has the form: _ _ O _ _  
and must contain S, T, E somewhere in positions 1-2 or 4-5 (since they’re marked “wrong position” in STOLE).

Remaining unused common letters: D, I, U, Y, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, W, V, etc.

I need a word that:
1. Has O in position 3.
2. Uses S, T, E in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.
3. Uses none of the eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, L).

A quick scan of common 5-letter words fitting _ _ O _ _ and containing S, T, E gives “STOKE”:
- S in position 1 (possible since S was in position 1 in STOLE and marked “wrong position”).
- T in position 2 (possible since T was in position 2 in STOLE and marked “wrong position”).
- O in position 3 (matches ✓).
- K is a new letter.
- E in position 5 (possible since E was in position 5 in CRANE and marked “wrong position”).

This seems like a good next guess to test S, T, E in new positions while keeping O fixed.

Current knowledge:

- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, L, K
- Letters in the word but in wrong positions: S, T, E
- O is fixed in position 3.

So the word must contain S, T, E plus O in position 3, and none of the forbidden letters.  
Possible positions for S, T, E: positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (but not the same spots they occupied in STOLE and STOKE).

Let’s look for a word of the form _ _ O _ _ that uses S, T, E and no forbidden letters.  
A quick scan gives “STEVE”:
- S in position 1 (was position 1 in STOLE, now new spot).

Current constraints:
- Word pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, L, K, V
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S, T, E
- O is fixed in position 3.

So the word must contain S, T, E exactly once each, plus O in position 3, and none of the forbidden letters.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ _ O _ _ that contains S, T, E in some permutation of positions 1, 2, 4, 5.

Possible permutations of S, T, E among positions 1,2,4,5:
- S, T, E must occupy three of these four positions, leaving one position blank (but we already have O in position 3).

Let’s list possible words:
- E S T O _ – no valid word
- E S _ O T – no valid word
- E _ S O T – “ESOT” is not a word
- _ E S O T – “E” is already used, “ESOT” is not valid
- _ S E O T – “S” is already used, “SEOT” is not valid
- _ S _ O E – “S” is already used, “S” again would be duplicate
- _ _ S O E – “S” is already used, “S” again would be duplicate
- T S E O _ – “TSE” not valid
- T E S O _ – “TESO” not valid
- E T S O _ – “ETSO” not valid
- T _ E O S – “T” is already used, “TEOS” not valid
- E _ T O S – “ETOS” not valid
- _ T E O S – “TEOS” not valid
- _ E T O S – “ETOS” not valid
- S T E O _ – “STEO” not valid
- S E T O _ – “SET O” not valid
- S _ E O T – “S” is already used, “S” again would be duplicate
- _ S T O E – “STOE” not valid
- _ T S O E – “TSOE” not valid
- E T O S _ – “ETOS” not valid
- E S O T _ – “ESOT” not valid
- E _ O S T – “E” is already used, “EOS T” not valid
- _ E O S T – “EOS T” not valid
- _ _ O S T – “OST” not valid

Wait, let’s try a different approach. The word must be _ _ O _ _ with S, T, E in positions 1,2,4,5 without duplicates.

Possible valid words:
- “E” can’t be in position 1 because we have S, T, E to place.
- “O” is fixed in position 3.
- Let’s list all 5-letter words ending in “O _ _” and containing S, T, E.

Actually, the pattern is _ _ O _ _. Let’s think of words like “DOES”, but we need 5 letters.

Let’s try “DOES” – no, it’s 4 letters.
“DOESY” – 5 letters, but Y is not yet eliminated.
“DOES” is 4 letters.

Let’s think of real words:
- “S” must be in 1,2,4,5
- “T” must be in 1,2,4,5
- “E” must be in 1,2,4,5
- O is in 3

Possible valid words:
- “SOFT” – but we need 5 letters.
- “STOPE” – but “P” is not yet eliminated.
- “STOPE” is 5 letters: S T O P E
  - S in 1, T in 2, O in 3, P in 4, E in 5
  - Check letters: S, T, O, P, E – none of C, R, A, N, L, K, V are present
  - Contains S, T, E plus O
  - This seems valid.

Another candidate: “STEIN” – but N is eliminated.
“STEIN” – N is eliminated (from CRANE feedback), so no.
“STEPP” – duplicate P, not valid.
“STOIC” – C is eliminated.
“STOKE” – K is eliminated.
“STOLE” – L is eliminated.
“STOPE” seems the only valid one left.

Let’s verify:
- STOPE: S T O P E
  - S: in word, position 1 (was 1 in STOLE, now new spot)
  - T: in word, position 2 (was 2 in STOLE, now new spot)
  - O: in word, position 3 (✓)
  - P: new letter
  - E: in word, position 5 (was 5 in CRANE, STOKE, STEVE, now new spot)

This fits all constraints.
