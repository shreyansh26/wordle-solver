For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters
- ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E - also very common
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - great vowel coverage
- ""AUDIO"" uses A, U, I, D, O - good vowel coverage but fewer common consonants

I think ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It has 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 very common consonants (S, T, L)
2. It covers letters that appear in many 5-letter words
3. It gives good positional information for S, T, L
4. It's a valid 5-letter word

This will provide maximum information for my next guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in the first position (S ✓)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A, T, E are not in the word at all (x)

So we know:
1. Word starts with S
2. L appears somewhere in positions 2-5 (but not position 2)
3. No A, T, E anywhere

Good next step: pick a word that:
- starts with S
- contains L in positions 3,4, or 5
- avoids A, T, E

Possible patterns: S _ L _ _ or S _ _ L _ or S _ _ _ L

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit:
- S C L _ _ (like SCOWL, SCOUR)
- S P L _ _ (like SPILL, SPILL)
- S _ L _ _ (like SWELL, SLICK - but SLICK has C in position 4)
- S _ _ L _ (like SABLE - but A is excluded)

Best options:
- SCOWL (S C O W L) - uses O, W which are common
- SCOUR (S C O U R) - uses O, U, R
- SWELL (S W E L L) - but E is excluded
- SLICK (S L I C K) - uses I, C, K

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in the first position (S ✓)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A, T, E are not in the word at all (x)

So we know:
1. Word starts with S
2. L appears somewhere in positions 2-5 (but not position 2)
3. No A, T, E anywhere

Good next step: pick a word that:
- starts with S
- contains L in positions 3,4, or 5
- avoids A, T, E

Possible patterns: S _ L _ _ or S _ _ L _ or S _ _ _ L

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit:
- S C L _ _ (like SCOWL, SCOUR)
- S P L _ _ (like SPILL, SPILL)
- S _ L _ _ (like SWELL, SLICK - but SLICK has C in position 4)
- S _ _ L _ (like SABLE - but A is excluded)

Best options:
- SCOWL (S C O W L) - uses O, W which are common
- SCOUR (S C O U R) - uses O, U, R
- SWELL (S W E L L) - but E is excluded
- SLICK (S L I C K) - uses I, C, K

SCOWL seems good: starts with S, has L in position 4, uses O and W which haven't been tested yet.

Current constraints:
1. First letter is S (✓ from both guesses)
2. L is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from SLATE and SCOWL)
   ⇒ L must be in position 3 or 5
3. C, A, T, E, W are NOT in the word (all marked x)
4. O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from SCOWL)
   ⇒ O must be in position 2, 4, or 5

Possible patterns:
- S _ L _ _ (L in 3)
- S _ _ _ L (L in 5)

But O must appear somewhere. Let’s explore:

Case 1: L in position 3  
  S _ L _ _  
  O must fit in 2,4, or 5  
  Valid positions for O: 2,4,5  
  Avoid C, A, T, E, W

Case 2: L in position 5  
  S _ _ _ L  
  O must fit in 2,3,4  
  Avoid C, A, T, E, W

Let’s list common 5-letter words fitting these patterns:

Case 1: S _ L _ _  
  - S O L _ _  → SOLID (I,D allowed)  
  - S _ L O _  → SPLOY (not a word)  
  - S _ L _ O  → S _ L _ O (e.g., SMOIL – not common)

Case 2: S _ _ _ L  
  - S _ O _ L  → S O B O L (not a word)  
  - S _ _ O L  → S P O O L (P,O allowed)  
  - S _ O _ L  → S H O U L (not a word)  
  - S _ _ O L  → S P O O L is valid and uses P,O which are still allowed

SPOWL is invalid (W excluded).  
SPOOL fits: S(✓), P(new), O(new), O(new), L(new) – all constraints met.

Let’s check:
- S is correct in first position (✓)  
- L is in the word (✓) and in position 5 (allowed)  
- O is in the word (✓) and in positions 3 (allowed)  
- P and second O are new letters we haven’t tested yet

SPOOL is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.

From the three guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is correct in position 1
   - L is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4
   - A, T, E are absent

2. SCOWL → S(✓) C(x) O(-) W(x) L(-)
   - S is correct in position 1
   - C, W are absent
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 4

3. SPOOL → S(✓) P(x) O(-) O(-) L(-)
   - S is correct in position 1
   - P is absent
   - O is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 5

So far we know:
- S _ _ _ _
- L must be in position 3 (only remaining slot that satisfies L not in 2,4,5)
- O must be in position 2 (only remaining slot that satisfies O not in 3,4)
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, R, U, V, X, Y, Z (minus those already excluded)
- From SPOOL we also saw that O cannot be in position 2 (because in SPOOL the second O was marked (-) for position 2). Wait, let's re-examine:

In SPOOL:
- Position 2: O is marked (-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 2
- Position 3: O is marked (-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 3
- Position 4: O is marked (-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 4
- Position 5: L is marked (-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 5

So L must be in position 3
O must be in position 2, 4, or 5, but:
- From SCOWL: O is not in position 3 (already known)
- From SPOOL: O is not in positions 2,3,4
- Therefore O must be in position 5

So the word must be: S O _ L _

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, R, U, V, X, Y, Z (minus any excluded letters)

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting S O _ L _:
- SOBUL (not a word)
- SOGOL (not a word)
- SOLAR (but A is excluded)
- SOKOL (valid word)
- SORAL (not a word)
- SOWEL (not a word)
- SORAL (not a word)
- SORAL (not a word)
- SORAL (not a word)

Actually, let's list valid words:
- SOGOL (not common)
- SOKOL (valid, refers to a type of bird or a Russian military unit)
- SOLAR (invalid, A excluded)
- SOULS (invalid, L already in position 3)
- SOULY (invalid, L already in position 3)
- SOULS (invalid)
- SOULY (invalid)
- SORAL (invalid)
- SORAL (invalid)
- SORAL (invalid)
- SORAL (invalid)

The only valid word seems to be SOKOL. Let's check:
- S(✓) O(-) K(new) O(-) L(-)
- But in SPOOL we saw O cannot be in position 2,3,4, so O must be in position 5
- Therefore the word must be S O _ L _

Looking again, the only valid word is SOKOL:
- S(✓) O(?) K(?) O(?) L(?)

But we know O must be in position 5, so the word is S O _ L _

Looking at valid words:
- SOKOL fits S O K L _ but we need 5 letters, so SOKOL is S O K O L, but O is in position 3 which is excluded
Wait, this seems conflicting.

Let me re-examine:
From SPOOL:
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 2,3,4
- Therefore O must be in position 5
- L must be in position 3 (only remaining slot)

So the word is S _ O L _

Looking for S _ O L _:
- S B O L _ (invalid)
- S C O L _ (invalid, C excluded)
- S D O L _ (invalid)
- S F O L _ (invalid)
- S G O L _ (invalid)
- S H O L _ (invalid)
- S I O L _ (invalid)
- S K O L _ (invalid)
- S M O L _ (invalid)
- S N O L _ (invalid)
- S P O L _ (invalid, P excluded)
- S R O L _ (invalid)
- S T O L _ (invalid, T excluded)
- S U O L _ (invalid)
- S V O L _ (invalid)
- S W O L _ (invalid, W excluded)
- S X O L _ (invalid)
- S Y O L _ (invalid)
- S Z O L _ (invalid)

None of these seem valid. This suggests an error in my earlier deduction.

Let me re-examine the constraints:

From all feedback:
- S is correct in position 1
- L is in the word but NOT in positions 2,4,5 (from SLATE, SCOWL, SPOOL)
  - Therefore L must be in position 3
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 2,3,4 (from SCOWL, SPOOL)
  - Therefore O must be in position 5

So the word must be S _ L _ O

Looking for S _ L _ O:
- S B L _ O (invalid)
- S C L _ O (invalid, C excluded)
- S D L _ O (invalid)
- S F L _ O (invalid)
- S G L _ O (invalid)
- S H L _ O (invalid)
- S I L _ O (invalid)
- S K L _ O (invalid)
- S M L _ O (invalid)
- S N L _ O (invalid)
- S P L _ O (invalid, P excluded)
- S R L _ O (invalid)
- S T L _ O (invalid, T excluded)
- S U L _ O (invalid)
- S V L _ O (invalid)
- S W L _ O (invalid, W excluded)
- S X L _ O (invalid)
- S Y L _ O (invalid)
- S Z L _ O (invalid)

Still no valid words. This indicates I must have made an error.

Re-examining SPOOL feedback:
- S(✓) P(x) O(-) O(-) L(-)
  - Position 2: O is marked (-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 2
  - Position 3: O is marked (-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 3
  - Position 4: O is marked (-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 4
  - Position 5: L is marked (-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 5

So:
- L must be in position 3
- O must be in position 1,2,3,4,5 but:
  - From SLATE: O is not in position 3
  - From SCOWL: O is not in position 3
  - From SPOOL: O is not in positions 2,3,4
  - Therefore O must be in position 1 or 5
  - But position 1 is S, so O must be in position 5

Thus the word is S _ L _ O

Looking for valid words:
- S B L _ O (invalid)
- S C L _ O (invalid, C excluded)
- S D L _ O (invalid)
- S F L _ O (invalid)
- S G L _ O (invalid)
- S H L _ O (invalid)
- S I L _ O (invalid)
- S K L _ O (invalid)
- S M L _ O (invalid)
- S N L _ O (invalid)
- S P L _ O (invalid, P excluded)
- S R L _ O (invalid)
- S T L _ O (invalid, T excluded)
- S U L _ O (invalid)
- S V L _ O (invalid)
- S W L _ O (invalid, W excluded)
- S X L _ O (invalid)
- S Y L _ O (invalid)
- S Z L _ O (invalid)

This seems impossible. I must have missed something.

Re-checking:
From SLATE: L is in word but not position 2
From SCOWL: L is in word but not position 4
From SPOOL: L is in word but not position 5
Thus L must be in position 3

From SCOWL: O is in word but not position 3
From SPOOL: O is in word but not positions 2,3,4
Thus O must be in position 5

Thus the word is S _ L _ O

Looking at valid 5-letter words: S B L O O (invalid), S C L O O (invalid), S D L O O (invalid), S F L O O (invalid), S G L O O (invalid), S H L O O (invalid), S I L O O (invalid), S K L O O (invalid), S M L O O (invalid), S N L O O (invalid), S P L O O (invalid, P excluded), S R L O O (invalid), S T L O O (invalid, T excluded), S U L O O (invalid), S V L O O (invalid), S W L O O (invalid, W excluded), S X L O O (invalid), S Y L O O (invalid), S Z L O O (invalid)

This suggests no valid word exists, which is impossible. I must have made an error in interpreting feedback.

Re-reading SPOOL feedback:
SPOOL → S(✓) P(x) O(-) O(-) L(-)
- Position 1: S(✓)
- Position 2: P(x) → P is not in the word
- Position 3: O(-) → O is in the word but not position 3
- Position 4: O(-) → O is in the word but not position 4
- Position 5: L(-) → L is in the word but not position 5

Thus:
- S _ _ _ _
- L must be in position 3 (only remaining slot)
- O must be in position 2 (only remaining slot that satisfies O not in 3,4,5)

Thus the word must be S O L _ _

Looking for valid words:
- S O L I D (D allowed, I allowed)
- S O L U T (invalid)
- S O L A R (invalid, A excluded)
- S O L V E (invalid, E excluded)
- S O L I D is valid

Let's check:
- S O L I D
- S(✓) O(?) L(✓) I(?) D(?)

This fits all constraints:
- S in position 1 (✓)
- L in position 3 (✓)
- O in position 2 (✓)
- I and D are new letters

Thus the next guess is SOLID.

- S V L _ O (invalid)
- S W L _ O (invalid, W excluded)
- S X L _ O (invalid)
- S Y L _ O (invalid)
- S Z L _ O (invalid)

This seems impossible. I must have missed something.

Re-checking:
From SLATE: L is in word but not position 2
From SCOWL: L is in word but not position 4
From SPOOL: L is in word but not position 5
Thus L must be in position 3

From SCOWL: O is in word but not position 3
From SPOOL: O is in word but not positions 2,3,4
Thus O must be in position 5

Thus the word is S _ L _ O

Looking at valid 5-letter words: S B L O O (invalid), S C L O O (invalid), S D L O O (invalid), S F L O O (invalid), S G L O O (invalid), S H L O O (invalid), S I L O O (invalid), S K L O O (invalid), S M L O O (invalid), S N L O O (invalid), S P L O O (invalid, P excluded), S R L O O (invalid), S T L O O (invalid, T excluded), S U L O O (invalid), S V L O O (invalid), S W L O O (invalid, W excluded), S X L O O (invalid), S Y L O O (invalid), S Z L O O (invalid)

This suggests no valid word exists, which is impossible. I must have made an error in interpreting feedback.

Re-reading SPOOL feedback:
SPOOL → S(✓) P(x) O(-) O(-) L(-)
- Position 1: S(✓)
- Position 2: P(x) → P is not in the word
- Position 3: O(-) → O is in the word but not position 3
- Position 4: O(-) → O is in the word but not position 4
- Position 5: L(-) → L is in the word but not position 5

Thus:
- S _ _ _ _
- L must be in position 3 (only remaining slot)
- O must be in position 2 (only remaining slot that satisfies O not in 3,4,5)

Thus the word must be S O L _ _

Looking for valid words:
- S O L I D (D allowed, I allowed)
- S O L U T (invalid)
- S O L A R (invalid, A excluded)
- S O L V E (invalid, E excluded)
- S O L I D is valid

Let's check:
- S O L I D
- S(✓) O(?) L(✓) I(?) D(?)

This fits all constraints:
- S in position 1 (✓)
- L in position 3 (✓)
- O in position 2 (✓)
- I and D are new letters

Thus the next guess is SOLID.",Guess 4: SOLID -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(✓) L(-) I(-) D(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. Some popular first guesses include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters
- ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E - also very common
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - great vowel coverage
- ""AUDIO"" uses A, U, I, D, O - good vowel coverage but fewer common consonants

I think ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It has 3 vowels (A, E) and 2 very common consonants (S, T, L)
2. It covers letters that appear in many 5-letter words
3. It gives good positional information for S, T, L
4. It's a valid 5-letter word

This will provide maximum information for my next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in the first position (S ✓)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A, T, E are not in the word at all (x)

So we know:
1. Word starts with S
2. L appears somewhere in positions 2-5 (but not position 2)
3. No A, T, E anywhere

Good next step: pick a word that:
- starts with S
- contains L in positions 3,4, or 5
- avoids A, T, E

Possible patterns: S _ L _ _ or S _ _ L _ or S _ _ _ L

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit:
- S C L _ _ (like SCOWL, SCOUR)
- S P L _ _ (like SPILL, SPILL)
- S _ L _ _ (like SWELL, SLICK - but SLICK has C in position 4)
- S _ _ L _ (like SABLE - but A is excluded)

Best options:
- SCOWL (S C O W L) - uses O, W which are common
- SCOUR (S C O U R) - uses O, U, R
- SWELL (S W E L L) - but E is excluded
- SLICK (S L I C K) - uses I, C, K

SCOWL seems good: starts with S, has L in position 4, uses O and W which haven't been tested yet.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SCOWL -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) O(-) W(x) L(-)
<|im_end|>

Current constraints:
1. First letter is S (✓ from both guesses)
2. L is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from SLATE and SCOWL)
   ⇒ L must be in position 3 or 5
3. C, A, T, E, W are NOT in the word (all marked x)
4. O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from SCOWL)
   ⇒ O must be in position 2, 4, or 5

Possible patterns:
- S _ L _ _ (L in 3)
- S _ _ _ L (L in 5)

But O must appear somewhere. Let’s explore:

Case 1: L in position 3  
  S _ L _ _  
  O must fit in 2,4, or 5  
  Valid positions for O: 2,4,5  
  Avoid C, A, T, E, W

Case 2: L in position 5  
  S _ _ _ L  
  O must fit in 2,3,4  
  Avoid C, A, T, E, W

Let’s list common 5-letter words fitting these patterns:

Case 1: S _ L _ _  
  - S O L _ _  → SOLID (I,D allowed)  
  - S _ L O _  → SPLOY (not a word)  
  - S _ L _ O  → S _ L _ O (e.g., SMOIL – not common)

Case 2: S _ _ _ L  
  - S _ O _ L  → S O B O L (not a word)  
  - S _ _ O L  → S P O O L (P,O allowed)  
  - S _ O _ L  → S H O U L (not a word)  
  - S _ _ O L  → S P O O L is valid and uses P,O which are still allowed

SPOWL is invalid (W excluded).  
SPOOL fits: S(✓), P(new), O(new), O(new), L(new) – all constraints met.

Let’s check:
- S is correct in first position (✓)  
- L is in the word (✓) and in position 5 (allowed)  
- O is in the word (✓) and in positions 3 (allowed)  
- P and second O are new letters we haven’t tested yet

SPOOL is a valid 5-letter word and fits all constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SCOWL -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) O(-) W(x) L(-)
Guess 3: SPOOL -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(-) O(-) L(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
   - S is correct in position 1
   - L is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4
   - A, T, E are absent

2. SCOWL → S(✓) C(x) O(-) W(x) L(-)
   - S is correct in position 1
   - C, W are absent
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 4

3. SPOOL → S(✓) P(x) O(-) O(-) L(-)
   - S is correct in position 1
   - P is absent
   - O is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 5

So far we know:
- S _ _ _ _
- L must be in position 3 (only remaining slot that satisfies L not in 2,4,5)
- O must be in position 2 (only remaining slot that satisfies O not in 3,4)
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, R, U, V, X, Y, Z (minus those already excluded)
- From SPOOL we also saw that O cannot be in position 2 (because in SPOOL the second O was marked (-) for position 2). Wait, let's re-examine:

In SPOOL:
- Position 2: O is marked (-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 2
- Position 3: O is marked (-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 3
- Position 4: O is marked (-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 4
- Position 5: L is marked (-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 5

So L must be in position 3
O must be in position 2, 4, or 5, but:
- From SCOWL: O is not in position 3 (already known)
- From SPOOL: O is not in positions 2,3,4
- Therefore O must be in position 5

So the word must be: S O _ L _

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, R, U, V, X, Y, Z (minus any excluded letters)

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting S O _ L _:
- SOBUL (not a word)
- SOGOL (not a word)
- SOLAR (but A is excluded)
- SOKOL (valid word)
- SORAL (not a word)
- SOWEL (not a word)
- SORAL (not a word)
- SORAL (not a word)
- SORAL (not a word)

Actually, let's list valid words:
- SOGOL (not common)
- SOKOL (valid, refers to a type of bird or a Russian military unit)
- SOLAR (invalid, A excluded)
- SOULS (invalid, L already in position 3)
- SOULY (invalid, L already in position 3)
- SOULS (invalid)
- SOULY (invalid)
- SORAL (invalid)
- SORAL (invalid)
- SORAL (invalid)
- SORAL (invalid)

The only valid word seems to be SOKOL. Let's check:
- S(✓) O(-) K(new) O(-) L(-)
- But in SPOOL we saw O cannot be in position 2,3,4, so O must be in position 5
- Therefore the word must be S O _ L _

Looking again, the only valid word is SOKOL:
- S(✓) O(?) K(?) O(?) L(?)

But we know O must be in position 5, so the word is S O _ L _

Looking at valid words:
- SOKOL fits S O K L _ but we need 5 letters, so SOKOL is S O K O L, but O is in position 3 which is excluded
Wait, this seems conflicting.

Let me re-examine:
From SPOOL:
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 2,3,4
- Therefore O must be in position 5
- L must be in position 3 (only remaining slot)

So the word is S _ O L _

Looking for S _ O L _:
- S B O L _ (invalid)
- S C O L _ (invalid, C excluded)
- S D O L _ (invalid)
- S F O L _ (invalid)
- S G O L _ (invalid)
- S H O L _ (invalid)
- S I O L _ (invalid)
- S K O L _ (invalid)
- S M O L _ (invalid)
- S N O L _ (invalid)
- S P O L _ (invalid, P excluded)
- S R O L _ (invalid)
- S T O L _ (invalid, T excluded)
- S U O L _ (invalid)
- S V O L _ (invalid)
- S W O L _ (invalid, W excluded)
- S X O L _ (invalid)
- S Y O L _ (invalid)
- S Z O L _ (invalid)

None of these seem valid. This suggests an error in my earlier deduction.

Let me re-examine the constraints:

From all feedback:
- S is correct in position 1
- L is in the word but NOT in positions 2,4,5 (from SLATE, SCOWL, SPOOL)
  - Therefore L must be in position 3
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 2,3,4 (from SCOWL, SPOOL)
  - Therefore O must be in position 5

So the word must be S _ L _ O

Looking for S _ L _ O:
- S B L _ O (invalid)
- S C L _ O (invalid, C excluded)
- S D L _ O (invalid)
- S F L _ O (invalid)
- S G L _ O (invalid)
- S H L _ O (invalid)
- S I L _ O (invalid)
- S K L _ O (invalid)
- S M L _ O (invalid)
- S N L _ O (invalid)
- S P L _ O (invalid, P excluded)
- S R L _ O (invalid)
- S T L _ O (invalid, T excluded)
- S U L _ O (invalid)
- S V L _ O (invalid)
- S W L _ O (invalid, W excluded)
- S X L _ O (invalid)
- S Y L _ O (invalid)
- S Z L _ O (invalid)

Still no valid words. This indicates I must have made an error.

Re-examining SPOOL feedback:
- S(✓) P(x) O(-) O(-) L(-)
  - Position 2: O is marked (-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 2
  - Position 3: O is marked (-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 3
  - Position 4: O is marked (-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 4
  - Position 5: L is marked (-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 5

So:
- L must be in position 3
- O must be in position 1,2,3,4,5 but:
  - From SLATE: O is not in position 3
  - From SCOWL: O is not in position 3
  - From SPOOL: O is not in positions 2,3,4
  - Therefore O must be in position 1 or 5
  - But position 1 is S, so O must be in position 5

Thus the word is S _ L _ O

Looking for valid words:
- S B L _ O (invalid)
- S C L _ O (invalid, C excluded)
- S D L _ O (invalid)
- S F L _ O (invalid)
- S G L _ O (invalid)
- S H L _ O (invalid)
- S I L _ O (invalid)
- S K L _ O (invalid)
- S M L _ O (invalid)
- S N L _ O (invalid)
- S P L _ O (invalid, P excluded)
- S R L _ O (invalid)
- S T L _ O (invalid, T excluded)
- S U L _ O (invalid)
- S V L _ O (invalid)
- S W L _ O (invalid, W excluded)
- S X L _ O (invalid)
- S Y L _ O (invalid)
- S Z L _ O (invalid)

This seems impossible. I must have missed something.

Re-checking:
From SLATE: L is in word but not position 2
From SCOWL: L is in word but not position 4
From SPOOL: L is in word but not position 5
Thus L must be in position 3

From SCOWL: O is in word but not position 3
From SPOOL: O is in word but not positions 2,3,4
Thus O must be in position 5

Thus the word is S _ L _ O

Looking at valid 5-letter words: S B L O O (invalid), S C L O O (invalid), S D L O O (invalid), S F L O O (invalid), S G L O O (invalid), S H L O O (invalid), S I L O O (invalid), S K L O O (invalid), S M L O O (invalid), S N L O O (invalid), S P L O O (invalid, P excluded), S R L O O (invalid), S T L O O (invalid, T excluded), S U L O O (invalid), S V L O O (invalid), S W L O O (invalid, W excluded), S X L O O (invalid), S Y L O O (invalid), S Z L O O (invalid)

This suggests no valid word exists, which is impossible. I must have made an error in interpreting feedback.

Re-reading SPOOL feedback:
SPOOL → S(✓) P(x) O(-) O(-) L(-)
- Position 1: S(✓)
- Position 2: P(x) → P is not in the word
- Position 3: O(-) → O is in the word but not position 3
- Position 4: O(-) → O is in the word but not position 4
- Position 5: L(-) → L is in the word but not position 5

Thus:
- S _ _ _ _
- L must be in position 3 (only remaining slot)
- O must be in position 2 (only remaining slot that satisfies O not in 3,4,5)

Thus the word must be S O L _ _

Looking for valid words:
- S O L I D (D allowed, I allowed)
- S O L U T (invalid)
- S O L A R (invalid, A excluded)
- S O L V E (invalid, E excluded)
- S O L I D is valid

Let's check:
- S O L I D
- S(✓) O(?) L(✓) I(?) D(?)

This fits all constraints:
- S in position 1 (✓)
- L in position 3 (✓)
- O in position 2 (✓)
- I and D are new letters

Thus the next guess is SOLID.

From the new feedback on SOLID:
- S(✓)  → position 1 is correct
- O(✓)  → position 2 is correct
- L(-)  → L is in the word but NOT in position 3
- I(-)  → I is in the word but NOT in position 4
- D(x)  → D is NOT in the word

Current constraints:
1. Word pattern: S O _ _ _
2. L must be in position 4 or 5 (since it can't be in 1,2,3)
3. I must be in position 1,2,3,5 (since it can't be in 4)
   - But positions 1 and 2 are already S and O, so I must be in position 3 or 5
4. Letters already excluded: A, T, E, C, W, P, D

Possible patterns:
- If L is in position 4: S O _ L _
- If L is in position 5: S O _ _ L

Also, I must be in the word somewhere:
   - If L is in position 4: I must be in position 3 or 5
   - If L is in position 5: I must be in position 3

Let's explore both cases.

Case 1: L in position 4 → S O _ L _
   - Position 3 must be I (since I can't be in 4) → S O I L _
   - Position 5 must be a letter not yet excluded and not already used: possible letters (from remaining alphabet excluding A,T,E,C,W,P,D,S,O,L,I)
   - Remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, R, U, V, X, Y, Z
   - Valid 5-letter words: SOILY (Y is allowed), SOILS (S already used), SOILB (invalid), etc.
   - SOILY fits: S O I L Y
   - Check constraints:
      - S(✓), O(✓), I(-) → I is in word but not position 4 (correct, it's position 3)
      - L(-) → L is in word but not position 3 (correct, it's position 4)
      - Y is new and allowed

Case 2: L in position 5 → S O _ _ L
   - I must be in position 3 → S O _ I L
   - Position 4 must be a letter not excluded: remaining letters
   - Possible words: SOBIL (invalid), SOGIL (invalid), etc. No common words fit.

Thus, the only plausible word is SOILY.
