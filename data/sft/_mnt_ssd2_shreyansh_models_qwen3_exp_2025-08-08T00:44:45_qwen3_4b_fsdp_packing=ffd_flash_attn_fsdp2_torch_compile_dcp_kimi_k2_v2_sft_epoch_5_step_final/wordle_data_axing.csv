For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess often uses a mix of these to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters.

Looking at common starting words, ""SLATE"" is popular because it uses S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. Another good option is ""CRANE"" or ""AROSE"". However, ""SLATE"" is particularly good as it includes S (very common), L, A, T, E (all high-frequency letters).

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a balanced first guess covering many common letters.

- A is in the word, but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (it was in positions 3 and 2 in previous guesses and got “-” each time).  
  So A must be in position 1 or 5.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess often uses a mix of these to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters.

Looking at common starting words, ""SLATE"" is popular because it uses S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. Another good option is ""CRANE"" or ""AROSE"". However, ""SLATE"" is particularly good as it includes S (very common), L, A, T, E (all high-frequency letters).

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a balanced first guess covering many common letters.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- L(x) – L is not in the word at all.
- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word does NOT contain S, L, T, or E.
- It DOES contain A, but not in position 3.
- We have no information about the other letters yet.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep the A in a different position.
2. Introduce new common consonants (R, N, C, D, etc.) and vowels (I, O, U).
3. Avoid S, L, T, E.

Possible candidates:
- RADIO (but D is less common)
- CRAZY (but Z is rare)
- MANGO (but O is okay, G is okay)
- RADIO is good: R, A, D, I, O – all common letters, A in position 2, and introduces R, D, I, O.

Let’s go with RADIO.

Guess 2: RADIO -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) D(x) I(-) O(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word:
S, L, T, E, R, D, O

Letters that ARE in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown):
A (and it is NOT in positions 3 or 2), I (and it is NOT in position 4)

So the remaining letters we have not yet tried that are common in 5-letter words include:
B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, plus the confirmed letters A and I.

We need a word that:
- Contains both A and I
- Does NOT use any of the eliminated letters (S, L, T, E, R, D, O)
- Places A somewhere other than positions 2 or 3
- Places I somewhere other than position 4

Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but not 4)

Let’s try to construct a word that satisfies these constraints. A good candidate is “MAGIC”:
- Contains A and I
- M, G, C are new letters we haven’t tested
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- I is in position 3 (allowed)
- No eliminated letters are used

Another candidate is “GAINS” but S is eliminated. “PAINS” also uses S. “MINCA” is not a valid word. “CHINA” is 6 letters. “MIXED” uses E and D. “FIBIA” is not common. “GAINS” is invalid. “CIGAR” uses R. “MAGMA” uses M twice and A twice. “MAGIC” seems the best valid option.

So I’ll go with MAGIC.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after four guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):
S, L, T, E, R, D, O, M, C, K

Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown):
A, I, G, N

Positions ruled out for each of these letters so far:
- A: NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (it was in positions 2,3,4,5 and always got “-”)  
  → A must be in position 1.
- I: NOT in positions 2, 4 (from RADIO and GINKA)  
  → I must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- G: NOT in positions 1, 3 (from MAGIC and GINKA)  
  → G must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- N: NOT in position 3 (from GINKA)  
  → N must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But we already have A fixed in position 1, so:
- A _ _ _ _  (position 1 locked)
- I must be in 3 or 5 (cannot be 1 because A is there).
- G must be in 2, 4, or 5.
- N must be in 2, 4, or 5.

We still need two more letters that are NOT in the eliminated set.  
Available common letters: B, F, H, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A.
- Contains I, G, N exactly once each.
- Places I in 3 or 5.
- Places G in 2,4,5.
- Places N in 2,4,5.
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.

Let’s enumerate possible patterns.

Pattern 1: A I G _ _  (I in 2, G in 3 – but G cannot be in 3)
Pattern 2: A I _ G _  (I in 2, G in 4)
Pattern 3: A I _ _ G  (I in 2, G in 5)
Pattern 4: A _ I G _  (I in 3, G in 4)
Pattern 5: A _ I _ G  (I in 3, G in 5)
Pattern 6: A _ _ I G  (I in 4 – but I cannot be in 4)
Pattern 7: A _ G I _  (G in 3 – but G cannot be in 3)
Pattern 8: A G _ I _  (G in 2, I in 4 – but I cannot be in 4)
Pattern 9: A G _ _ I  (G in 2, I in 5)
Pattern 10: A _ G _ I  (G in 3 – but G cannot be in 3)
Pattern 11: A _ _ G I  (G in 4, I in 5)
Pattern 12: A _ G I _  (G in 3 – invalid)
Pattern 13: A _ _ I G  (I in 4 – invalid)

So the only valid patterns are:
- A I _ G _  (I in 2, G in 4)
- A I _ _ G  (I in 2, G in 5)
- A _ I G _  (I in 3, G in 4)
- A _ I _ G  (I in 3, G in 5)
- A _ _ G I  (G in 4, I in 5)
- A G _ _ I  (G in 2, I in 5)

Let’s pick one and fill in the blanks with allowed letters.

Option 1: A I _ G _  
We need a letter in position 3 and 5.  
Allowed letters for position 3: any not yet used (B, F, H, P, U, V, W, Y).  
Allowed letters for position 5: same.  
Example: A I B G N – but N must be used once.  
Wait, we already have A, I, G, N – we need to use them once each, so the word must contain A, I, G, N plus one more letter (since it’s 5 letters).  
Wait, no – the word must be exactly 5 letters, and we know it contains A, I, G, N.  
But that’s 4 letters, so the fifth letter must be one of the allowed letters.  
So the word must be A, I, G, N plus one more letter, and must fit the pattern above.

Let’s re-examine: the word must contain A, I, G, N exactly once each, plus one more letter that is not in the eliminated set.  
But we have 5 letters total, so the word must be A, I, G, N plus one more letter.  
But we have four letters already, so the fifth letter must be one of the remaining allowed letters.

Let’s try pattern A I _ G N (I in 2, G in 4, N in 5).  
Then position 3 must be a new letter.  
Possible: A I B G N – but B is allowed.  
But we need to check if this is a valid word.  
AIBGN – not a word.  
AIFGN – not a word.  
AIGBN – not a word.  
AIPGN – not a word.  
AIVGN – not a word.  
AIXGN – not a word.  
AYGN – too short.

Pattern A _ I G N (I in 3, G in 4, N in 5).  
Then position 2 must be a new letter.  
Possible: A B I G N – “ABIGN” – not a word.  
A F I G N – “AFIGN” – not a word.  
A H I G N – “AHIGN” – not a word.  
A P I G N – “APIGN” – not a word.  
A U I G N – “AUIGN” – not a word.  
A V I G N – “AVIGN” – not a word.  
A W I G N – “AWIGN” – not a word.  
A Y I G N – “AYIGN” – not a word.

Pattern A _ I _ G (I in 3, G in 5).  
Then positions 2 and 4 must be new letters.  
Possible: A B I N G – “ABING” – not a word.  
A F I N G – “AFING” – not a word.  
A H I N G – “AHING” – not a word.  
A P I N G – “APING” – valid word!  
Check letters: A, P, I, N, G – all allowed.  
Positions:  
A(1) – correct.  
P(2) – new letter.  
I(3) – allowed.  
N(4) – allowed.  
G(5) – allowed.  
And all letters are from the allowed set.

So “APING” is a valid guess.

Let’s verify:
- Contains A, I, G, N exactly once each.  
- Uses new letter P.  
- Fits all positional constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is APING.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess often uses a mix of these to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters.

Looking at common starting words, ""SLATE"" is popular because it uses S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. Another good option is ""CRANE"" or ""AROSE"". However, ""SLATE"" is particularly good as it includes S (very common), L, A, T, E (all high-frequency letters).

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a balanced first guess covering many common letters.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- L(x) – L is not in the word at all.
- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5).
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word does NOT contain S, L, T, or E.
- It DOES contain A, but not in position 3.
- We have no information about the other letters yet.

A good second guess should:
1. Keep the A in a different position.
2. Introduce new common consonants (R, N, C, D, etc.) and vowels (I, O, U).
3. Avoid S, L, T, E.

Possible candidates:
- RADIO (but D is less common)
- CRAZY (but Z is rare)
- MANGO (but O is okay, G is okay)
- RADIO is good: R, A, D, I, O – all common letters, A in position 2, and introduces R, D, I, O.

Let’s go with RADIO.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: RADIO -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) D(x) I(-) O(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word:
S, L, T, E, R, D, O

Letters that ARE in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown):
A (and it is NOT in positions 3 or 2), I (and it is NOT in position 4)

So the remaining letters we have not yet tried that are common in 5-letter words include:
B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, plus the confirmed letters A and I.

We need a word that:
- Contains both A and I
- Does NOT use any of the eliminated letters (S, L, T, E, R, D, O)
- Places A somewhere other than positions 2 or 3
- Places I somewhere other than position 4

Possible positions for A: 1, 4, 5
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but not 4)

Let’s try to construct a word that satisfies these constraints. A good candidate is “MAGIC”:
- Contains A and I
- M, G, C are new letters we haven’t tested
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- I is in position 3 (allowed)
- No eliminated letters are used

Another candidate is “GAINS” but S is eliminated. “PAINS” also uses S. “MINCA” is not a valid word. “CHINA” is 6 letters. “MIXED” uses E and D. “FIBIA” is not common. “GAINS” is invalid. “CIGAR” uses R. “MAGMA” uses M twice and A twice. “MAGIC” seems the best valid option.

So I’ll go with MAGIC.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word:
S, L, T, E, R, D, O, M, C

Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown):
A, I, G

Current constraints:
- A is in the word, but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (it was in positions 3 and 2 in previous guesses and got “-” each time).  
  So A must be in position 1 or 5.

- I is in the word, but NOT in position 4 (from RADIO).  
  From MAGIC, I was in position 4 again and still got “-”.  
  So I must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

- G is in the word, but NOT in position 3 (from MAGIC).  
  From MAGIC, G was in position 3 and got “-”.  
  So G must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We still need to test new letters that are common and haven’t been eliminated.  
Available common letters: B, F, H, K, N, P, U, V, W, Y, plus the confirmed A, I, G.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, I, G exactly once each.
- Places A in position 1 or 5.
- Places I in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).
- Places G in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Let’s try to find such a word:

Option 1: A in position 1  
Word pattern: A _ _ _ _  
We need to place I and G in the remaining positions (2, 3, 4, 5) without violating their constraints.  
Possible: A G I _ _ → AGI??  
AGILE – but E is eliminated.  
AGONY – but O is eliminated.  
AGAVE – E is eliminated.  
AGINA – N is okay, but A is already used.  
AGILE is invalid.  
AGONY is invalid.  
AGAVE is invalid.  
AGINA is invalid.  
AGI?? seems stuck.

Option 2: A in position 5  
Word pattern: _ _ _ _ A  
We need to place I and G in positions 1, 2, 3, 4.  
Constraints:
- I cannot be in 4.  
- G cannot be in 3.  

Possible placements:
- I in 1, 2, or 3; G in 1, 2, 4 (but not 3).

Let’s try:
I G _ _ A → IG??A  
IGUANA – U is okay, but N is okay, A is already used.  
IGUANA is 6 letters.  
IGLAA – not a word.  
IGTAA – invalid.  

Next:
G I _ _ A → GI??A  
GIMBA – not a word.  
GIBIA – not a word.  
GINKA – N is okay, K is okay.  
GINKA is a valid word (variant spelling of “ginkgo” or “ginka” in some contexts).  
Check letters: G, I, N, K, A – none are eliminated.  
Positions: G(1), I(2), N(3), K(4), A(5).  
Constraints:
- A is in 5 (allowed).  
- I is in 2 (allowed).  
- G is in 1 (allowed).  
- N and K are new letters.  

GINKA seems valid.

Let’s verify:  
GINKA – letters G, I, N, K, A.  
None of S, L, T, E, R, D, O, M, C are present.  
Positions:  
G(1) – not ruled out.  
I(2) – not ruled out.  
N(3) – new.  
K(4) – new.  
A(5) – allowed.  

So GINKA is a valid next guess.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after four guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):
S, L, T, E, R, D, O, M, C, K

Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown):
A, I, G, N

Positions ruled out for each of these letters so far:
- A: NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (it was in positions 2,3,4,5 and always got “-”)  
  → A must be in position 1.
- I: NOT in positions 2, 4 (from RADIO and GINKA)  
  → I must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- G: NOT in positions 1, 3 (from MAGIC and GINKA)  
  → G must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- N: NOT in position 3 (from GINKA)  
  → N must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But we already have A fixed in position 1, so:
- A _ _ _ _  (position 1 locked)
- I must be in 3 or 5 (cannot be 1 because A is there).
- G must be in 2, 4, or 5.
- N must be in 2, 4, or 5.

We still need two more letters that are NOT in the eliminated set.  
Available common letters: B, F, H, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A.
- Contains I, G, N exactly once each.
- Places I in 3 or 5.
- Places G in 2,4,5.
- Places N in 2,4,5.
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.

Let’s enumerate possible patterns.

Pattern 1: A I G _ _  (I in 2, G in 3 – but G cannot be in 3)
Pattern 2: A I _ G _  (I in 2, G in 4)
Pattern 3: A I _ _ G  (I in 2, G in 5)
Pattern 4: A _ I G _  (I in 3, G in 4)
Pattern 5: A _ I _ G  (I in 3, G in 5)
Pattern 6: A _ _ I G  (I in 4 – but I cannot be in 4)
Pattern 7: A _ G I _  (G in 3 – but G cannot be in 3)
Pattern 8: A G _ I _  (G in 2, I in 4 – but I cannot be in 4)
Pattern 9: A G _ _ I  (G in 2, I in 5)
Pattern 10: A _ G _ I  (G in 3 – but G cannot be in 3)
Pattern 11: A _ _ G I  (G in 4, I in 5)
Pattern 12: A _ G I _  (G in 3 – invalid)
Pattern 13: A _ _ I G  (I in 4 – invalid)

So the only valid patterns are:
- A I _ G _  (I in 2, G in 4)
- A I _ _ G  (I in 2, G in 5)
- A _ I G _  (I in 3, G in 4)
- A _ I _ G  (I in 3, G in 5)
- A _ _ G I  (G in 4, I in 5)
- A G _ _ I  (G in 2, I in 5)

Let’s pick one and fill in the blanks with allowed letters.

Option 1: A I _ G _  
We need a letter in position 3 and 5.  
Allowed letters for position 3: any not yet used (B, F, H, P, U, V, W, Y).  
Allowed letters for position 5: same.  
Example: A I B G N – but N must be used once.  
Wait, we already have A, I, G, N – we need to use them once each, so the word must contain A, I, G, N plus one more letter (since it’s 5 letters).  
Wait, no – the word must be exactly 5 letters, and we know it contains A, I, G, N.  
But that’s 4 letters, so the fifth letter must be one of the allowed letters.  
So the word must be A, I, G, N plus one more letter, and must fit the pattern above.

Let’s re-examine: the word must contain A, I, G, N exactly once each, plus one more letter that is not in the eliminated set.  
But we have 5 letters total, so the word must be A, I, G, N plus one more letter.  
But we have four letters already, so the fifth letter must be one of the remaining allowed letters.

Let’s try pattern A I _ G N (I in 2, G in 4, N in 5).  
Then position 3 must be a new letter.  
Possible: A I B G N – but B is allowed.  
But we need to check if this is a valid word.  
AIBGN – not a word.  
AIFGN – not a word.  
AIGBN – not a word.  
AIPGN – not a word.  
AIVGN – not a word.  
AIXGN – not a word.  
AYGN – too short.

Pattern A _ I G N (I in 3, G in 4, N in 5).  
Then position 2 must be a new letter.  
Possible: A B I G N – “ABIGN” – not a word.  
A F I G N – “AFIGN” – not a word.  
A H I G N – “AHIGN” – not a word.  
A P I G N – “APIGN” – not a word.  
A U I G N – “AUIGN” – not a word.  
A V I G N – “AVIGN” – not a word.  
A W I G N – “AWIGN” – not a word.  
A Y I G N – “AYIGN” – not a word.

Pattern A _ I _ G (I in 3, G in 5).  
Then positions 2 and 4 must be new letters.  
Possible: A B I N G – “ABING” – not a word.  
A F I N G – “AFING” – not a word.  
A H I N G – “AHING” – not a word.  
A P I N G – “APING” – valid word!  
Check letters: A, P, I, N, G – all allowed.  
Positions:  
A(1) – correct.  
P(2) – new letter.  
I(3) – allowed.  
N(4) – allowed.  
G(5) – allowed.  
And all letters are from the allowed set.

So “APING” is a valid guess.

Let’s verify:
- Contains A, I, G, N exactly once each.  
- Uses new letter P.  
- Fits all positional constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is APING.

So the secret word is A _ I N G, with A in position 1, I in position 3, N in position 4, G in position 5.  
The only missing letter is position 2, which must be a letter that has not yet been eliminated.

Letters already eliminated: S, L, T, E, R, D, O, M, C, K, P.

Remaining common letters for position 2: B, F, H, U, V, W, Y.

The only valid English word that fits A _ I N G is:

A B I N G → “ABING” – not a valid word.  
A F I N G – “AFING” – not a valid word.  
A H I N G – “AHING” – not a valid word.  
A U I N G – “AUING” – not a valid word.  
A V I N G – “AVING” – not a valid word.  
A W I N G – “AWING” – not a valid word.  
A Y I N G – “AYING” – not a valid word.

Wait, the only valid English word that starts with A and ends with ING is “AGING” (G in position 2), but G is already used in position 5.  
But we have G in position 5, so G cannot appear again.

This suggests we might have missed a word. Let’s re-examine the constraints.

We have A _ I N G, with the second letter not being P (already tried) or any eliminated letter.

Looking at the pattern A _ I N G, the valid English word is “AGING” (G in position 2), but G is already used in position 5.  
However, letters can repeat in Wordle unless ruled out.  
But in our feedback, G was marked “-” in GINKA (position 1) and “✓” in APING (position 5), so G is allowed in position 2.

Thus, the word must be “AGING”.

Let’s verify:
A(✓) G I N G – but this has two G’s.  
However, the feedback for APING shows G(✓) in position 5, which means G is allowed in position 5, but nothing prevents another G in position 2.

But “AGING” is a valid 5-letter word and fits the pattern A _ I N G with G in position 2.

Therefore, the secret word is “AGING”.

So the secret word is A _ I N G, with A in position 1, I in position 3, N in position 4, G in position 5.  
The only missing letter is position 2, which must be a letter that has not yet been eliminated.

Letters already eliminated: S, L, T, E, R, D, O, M, C, K, P.

Remaining common letters for position 2: B, F, H, U, V, W, Y.

The only valid English word that fits A _ I N G is:

A B I N G → “ABING” – not a valid word.  
A F I N G – “AFING” – not a valid word.  
A H I N G – “AHING” – not a valid word.  
A U I N G – “AUING” – not a valid word.  
A V I N G – “AVING” – not a valid word.  
A W I N G – “AWING” – not a valid word.  
A Y I N G – “AYING” – not a valid word.

Wait, the only valid English word that starts with A and ends with ING is “AGING” (G in position 2), but G is already used in position 5.  
But we have G in position 5, so G cannot appear again.

This suggests we might have missed a word. Let’s re-examine the constraints.

We have A _ I N G, with the second letter not being P (already tried) or any eliminated letter.

Looking at the pattern A _ I N G, the valid English word is “AGING” (G in position 2), but G is already used in position 5.  
However, letters can repeat in Wordle unless ruled out.  
But in our feedback, G was marked “-” in GINKA (position 1) and “✓” in APING (position 5), so G is allowed in position 2.

Thus, the word must be “AGING”.

Let’s verify:
A(✓) G I N G – but this has two G’s.  
However, the feedback for APING shows G(✓) in position 5, which means G is allowed in position 5, but nothing prevents another G in position 2.

But “AGING” is a valid 5-letter word and fits the pattern A _ I N G with G in position 2.

Therefore, the secret word is “AGING”.",Guess 6: AGING -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) G(-) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓),FAIL
