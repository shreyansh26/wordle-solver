For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (uses A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains three vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (S, T, L), which should give good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it can't be first).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it can't be last).
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S and E (and possibly other letters not yet ruled out).
2. Avoids positions 1 for S and 5 for E.
3. Avoids L, A, T.

Good candidate letters to try next: common consonants not yet tested (R, N, C, D, M, P, etc.) and remaining vowels (I, O, U).

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. One strong choice is ""RESON"":
- R, E, S, O, N
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 3 (allowed).
- Avoids L, A, T.
- Uses new letters R, O, N.

Another option is ""SENOR"" but that's not a valid English word. ""RESON"" is valid.

I'll go with ""RESON"".

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.
- L, A, T are NOT in the word.

From Guess 2 (RESON → R(x) E(-) S(-) O(-) N(-)):
- R is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we have:
Letters confirmed to be in the word: S, E, O, N
Letters confirmed NOT in the word: L, A, T, R

Positions ruled out:
- S: positions 1, 3
- E: positions 2, 5
- O: position 4
- N: position 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, E, O, N (each exactly once, since they’re all distinct)
2. Does not place S in positions 1 or 3, E in positions 2 or 5, O in position 4, or N in position 5.

Let’s list possible positions for each letter:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5

S: can be in 2, 4, or 5
E: can be in 1, 3, or 4
O: can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5
N: can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

We also need one more letter (since we have 4 letters already). The remaining letters must not be L, A, T, R.

Good remaining letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place the letters:

We need to fit S, E, O, N plus one more letter into the 5 positions.

Let’s try to construct a word:

Option 1: Place S in position 2
Then E could be in 1, 3, or 4
O could be in 1, 2, 3, or 5
N could be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

Let’s try:
E S _ _ _
Then we need to place O and N, plus one more letter.

Possible word: E S N O _ (but N can’t be in 3, O can’t be in 4, etc.)

Let’s try:
E S _ N O → positions 1-5: E S _ N O
Check constraints:
- S is in 2 (allowed)
- E is in 1 (allowed)
- N is in 4 (allowed)
- O is in 5 (allowed)
- We need one more letter in position 3.

We need a letter not yet ruled out (not L, A, T, R). Let’s pick C.

So the word would be E S C N O. Is that a valid English word? No.

Try another arrangement.

Let’s try placing O in position 1:
O _ _ _ _
Then S must be in 2, 4, or 5
E must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 1 is taken by O)
N must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 1 is taken by O)

Let’s try:
O N _ _ _
Then S must be in 3, 4, or 5
E must be in 3 or 4
We need one more letter.

Try:
O N E S _ → positions 1-5: O N E S _
Check constraints:
- S is in 4 (allowed)
- E is in 3 (allowed)
- O in 1 (allowed)
- N in 2 (allowed)
- Need a letter for position 5 (not L, A, T, R). Let’s pick C.

E must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 1 is O)
N must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 1 is O, 2 is S)
So N could be in 3 or 4
E could be in 3 or 4

Let’s try:

Check constraints:
- S is in 2 (allowed)

After going through many possibilities, the most promising valid word seems to be “SONIC” but that has I, which we haven’t ruled out.

Wait, let’s try “SONIC”:
S O N I C
Check constraints:
- S in 1 (but S can’t be in 1) – invalid.

Try “COONS”:
C O O N S
Check constraints:
- Contains O twice, which is fine.
- S in 5 (allowed)
- E must be in word, but “COONS” has no E – invalid.

Try “SONES”:
S O N E S
Check constraints:
- S in 1 (invalid)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)
- But S is repeated, which might be allowed, but we don’t know.

However, “SONES” has S twice, which is possible, but we don’t know if the word has duplicate letters.

Let’s try “ONES” plus a letter:
We need a 5-letter word with S, E, O, N plus one more letter.

Let’s try “SONIC” again – but S can’t be in 1.

Try “CENSE”:
C E N S E
Check constraints:
- S in 4 (allowed)
- E in 2 (but E can’t be in 2) – invalid.

Try “CENSE” again – same issue.

Try “SENOR” – but that’s not valid.

Try “SENCE”:
S E N C E
Check constraints:
- S in 1 (invalid)
- E in 2 (invalid)

Try “ENOS” plus a letter – but that’s 4 letters.

Let’s try “CONES”:
C O N E S
Check constraints:
- C is new, allowed
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)
- Contains S, E, O, N plus C – valid.

But we don’t know if C is in the word. Since C hasn’t been tested yet, it’s possible.

But let’s see if we can find a word without introducing new letters we haven’t tested.

Wait, we have S, E, O, N plus one more letter. The most common remaining letters are C, D, I, K, M, P, U, etc.

Let’s try “CENSE” – invalid due to E in 2.

Try “CENSE” – same.

Try “PONES”:
P O N E S
Check constraints:
- P is new
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)
- Contains S, E, O, N plus P – valid.

But P hasn’t been tested yet.

Let’s try “PONES”.

But is there a more likely word? Let’s think differently.

We have S, E, O, N plus one more letter. The word must be valid.

Let’s try “SONIC” – but S can’t be in 1.

Try “SONIC” again – invalid.

Try “CONES” – valid.

Let’s go with “CONES” as it’s a common word and fits all constraints.

Check:
C O N E S
- C is new, allowed
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)
- Contains S, E, O, N plus C – valid.

This seems like the best option.
</think>

Based on the feedback, the secret word contains S, E, O, N and does not contain L, A, T, R. After considering valid 5-letter words, a good next guess is ""CONES"".

<guess>CONES</guess>",CONES,"Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.
- L, A, T are NOT in the word.

From Guess 2 (RESON → R(x) E(-) S(-) O(-) N(-)):
- R is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we have:
Letters confirmed to be in the word: S, E, O, N
Letters confirmed NOT in the word: L, A, T, R

Positions ruled out:
- S: positions 1, 3
- E: positions 2, 5
- O: position 4
- N: position 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, E, O, N (each exactly once, since they’re all distinct)
2. Does not place S in positions 1 or 3, E in positions 2 or 5, O in position 4, or N in position 5.

Let’s list possible positions for each letter:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5

S: can be in 2, 4, or 5
E: can be in 1, 3, or 4
O: can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5
N: can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

We also need one more letter (since we have 4 letters already). The remaining letters must not be L, A, T, R.

Good remaining letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place the letters:

We need to fit S, E, O, N plus one more letter into the 5 positions.

Let’s try to construct a word:

Option 1: Place S in position 2
Then E could be in 1, 3, or 4
O could be in 1, 2, 3, or 5
N could be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

Let’s try:
E S _ _ _
Then we need to place O and N, plus one more letter.

Possible word: E S N O _ (but N can’t be in 3, O can’t be in 4, etc.)

Let’s try:
E S _ N O → positions 1-5: E S _ N O
Check constraints:
- S is in 2 (allowed)
- E is in 1 (allowed)
- N is in 4 (allowed)
- O is in 5 (allowed)
- We need one more letter in position 3.

We need a letter not yet ruled out (not L, A, T, R). Let’s pick C.

So the word would be E S C N O. Is that a valid English word? No.

Try another arrangement.

Let’s try placing O in position 1:
O _ _ _ _
Then S must be in 2, 4, or 5
E must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 1 is taken by O)
N must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 1 is taken by O)

Let’s try:
O N _ _ _
Then S must be in 3, 4, or 5
E must be in 3 or 4
We need one more letter.

Try:
O N E S _ → positions 1-5: O N E S _
Check constraints:
- S is in 4 (allowed)
- E is in 3 (allowed)
- O in 1 (allowed)
- N in 2 (allowed)
- Need a letter for position 5 (not L, A, T, R). Let’s pick C.

E could be in 3 or 4

We need a 5-letter word with S, E, O, N plus one more letter.

Let’s try “SONIC” again – but S can’t be in 1.

Try “CENSE”:
C E N S E
Check constraints:
- S in 4 (allowed)
- E in 2 (but E can’t be in 2) – invalid.

Try “CENSE” again – same issue.

Try “SENOR” – but that’s not valid.

Try “SENCE”:
S E N C E
Check constraints:
- S in 1 (invalid)
- E in 2 (invalid)

Try “ENOS” plus a letter – but that’s 4 letters.

Let’s try “CONES”:
C O N E S
Check constraints:
- C is new, allowed
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)
- Contains S, E, O, N plus C – valid.

But we don’t know if C is in the word. Since C hasn’t been tested yet, it’s possible.

But let’s see if we can find a word without introducing new letters we haven’t tested.

Wait, we have S, E, O, N plus one more letter. The most common remaining letters are C, D, I, K, M, P, U, etc.

Let’s try “CENSE” – invalid due to E in 2.

Try “CENSE” – same.

Try “PONES”:
P O N E S
Check constraints:
- P is new
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)
- Contains S, E, O, N plus P – valid.

But P hasn’t been tested yet.

Let’s try “PONES”.

But is there a more likely word? Let’s think differently.

We have S, E, O, N plus one more letter. The word must be valid.

Let’s try “SONIC” – but S can’t be in 1.

Try “SONIC” again – invalid.

Try “CONES” – valid.

Let’s go with “CONES” as it’s a common word and fits all constraints.

Check:
C O N E S
- C is new, allowed
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)
- Contains S, E, O, N plus C – valid.

This seems like the best option.Based on the feedback, the secret word contains S, E, O, N and does not contain L, A, T, R. After considering valid 5-letter words, a good next guess is ""CONES"".",Guess 3: CONES -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (uses A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains three vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (S, T, L), which should give good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it can't be first).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it can't be last).
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S and E (and possibly other letters not yet ruled out).
2. Avoids positions 1 for S and 5 for E.
3. Avoids L, A, T.

Good candidate letters to try next: common consonants not yet tested (R, N, C, D, M, P, etc.) and remaining vowels (I, O, U).

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. One strong choice is ""RESON"":
- R, E, S, O, N
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 3 (allowed).
- Avoids L, A, T.
- Uses new letters R, O, N.

Another option is ""SENOR"" but that's not a valid English word. ""RESON"" is valid.

I'll go with ""RESON"".

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.
- L, A, T are NOT in the word.

From Guess 2 (RESON → R(x) E(-) S(-) O(-) N(-)):
- R is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we have:
Letters confirmed to be in the word: S, E, O, N
Letters confirmed NOT in the word: L, A, T, R

Positions ruled out:
- S: positions 1, 3
- E: positions 2, 5
- O: position 4
- N: position 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, E, O, N (each exactly once, since they’re all distinct)
2. Does not place S in positions 1 or 3, E in positions 2 or 5, O in position 4, or N in position 5.

Let’s list possible positions for each letter:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5

S: can be in 2, 4, or 5
E: can be in 1, 3, or 4
O: can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5
N: can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

We also need one more letter (since we have 4 letters already). The remaining letters must not be L, A, T, R.

Good remaining letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place the letters:

We need to fit S, E, O, N plus one more letter into the 5 positions.

Let’s try to construct a word:

Option 1: Place S in position 2
Then E could be in 1, 3, or 4
O could be in 1, 2, 3, or 5
N could be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

Let’s try:
E S _ _ _
Then we need to place O and N, plus one more letter.

Possible word: E S N O _ (but N can’t be in 3, O can’t be in 4, etc.)

Let’s try:
E S _ N O → positions 1-5: E S _ N O
Check constraints:
- S is in 2 (allowed)
- E is in 1 (allowed)
- N is in 4 (allowed)
- O is in 5 (allowed)
- We need one more letter in position 3.

We need a letter not yet ruled out (not L, A, T, R). Let’s pick C.

So the word would be E S C N O. Is that a valid English word? No.

Try another arrangement.

Let’s try placing O in position 1:
O _ _ _ _
Then S must be in 2, 4, or 5
E must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 1 is taken by O)
N must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 1 is taken by O)

Let’s try:
O N _ _ _
Then S must be in 3, 4, or 5
E must be in 3 or 4
We need one more letter.

Try:
O N E S _ → positions 1-5: O N E S _
Check constraints:
- S is in 4 (allowed)
- E is in 3 (allowed)
- O in 1 (allowed)
- N in 2 (allowed)
- Need a letter for position 5 (not L, A, T, R). Let’s pick C.

Word: O N E S C → “ONES C” – not valid.

Try:
O N S E _ → positions 1-5: O N S E _
Check constraints:
- S is in 3 (but S can’t be in 3) – invalid.

S in 2
E must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 1 is O)
N must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 1 is O, 2 is S)
So N could be in 3 or 4
E could be in 3 or 4

Let’s try:
O S N E _ → positions 1-5: O S N E _
Check constraints:
- S is in 2 (allowed)
- E is in 4 (allowed)

Let’s try placing S in position 4:

O must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5
N must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 4 is S)

Let’s try:

After going through many possibilities, the most promising valid word seems to be “SONIC” but that has I, which we haven’t ruled out.

Wait, let’s try “SONIC”:
S O N I C
Check constraints:
- S in 1 (but S can’t be in 1) – invalid.

Try “COONS”:
C O O N S
Check constraints:
- Contains O twice, which is fine.
- S in 5 (allowed)
- E must be in word, but “COONS” has no E – invalid.

Try “SONES”:
S O N E S
Check constraints:
- S in 1 (invalid)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)
- But S is repeated, which might be allowed, but we don’t know.

However, “SONES” has S twice, which is possible, but we don’t know if the word has duplicate letters.

Let’s try “ONES” plus a letter:
We need a 5-letter word with S, E, O, N plus one more letter.

Let’s try “SONIC” again – but S can’t be in 1.

Try “CENSE”:
C E N S E
Check constraints:
- S in 4 (allowed)
- E in 2 (but E can’t be in 2) – invalid.

Try “CENSE” again – same issue.

Try “SENOR” – but that’s not valid.

Try “SENCE”:
S E N C E
Check constraints:
- S in 1 (invalid)
- E in 2 (invalid)

Try “ENOS” plus a letter – but that’s 4 letters.

Let’s try “CONES”:
C O N E S
Check constraints:
- C is new, allowed
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)
- Contains S, E, O, N plus C – valid.

But we don’t know if C is in the word. Since C hasn’t been tested yet, it’s possible.

But let’s see if we can find a word without introducing new letters we haven’t tested.

Wait, we have S, E, O, N plus one more letter. The most common remaining letters are C, D, I, K, M, P, U, etc.

Let’s try “CENSE” – invalid due to E in 2.

Try “CENSE” – same.

Try “PONES”:
P O N E S
Check constraints:
- P is new
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)
- Contains S, E, O, N plus P – valid.

But P hasn’t been tested yet.

Let’s try “PONES”.

But is there a more likely word? Let’s think differently.

We have S, E, O, N plus one more letter. The word must be valid.

Let’s try “SONIC” – but S can’t be in 1.

Try “SONIC” again – invalid.

Try “CONES” – valid.

Let’s go with “CONES” as it’s a common word and fits all constraints.

Check:
C O N E S
- C is new, allowed
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)
- Contains S, E, O, N plus C – valid.

This seems like the best option.Based on the feedback, the secret word contains S, E, O, N and does not contain L, A, T, R. After considering valid 5-letter words, a good next guess is ""CONES"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (uses A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains three vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (S, T, L), which should give good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it can't be first).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it can't be last).
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S and E (and possibly other letters not yet ruled out).
2. Avoids positions 1 for S and 5 for E.
3. Avoids L, A, T.

Good candidate letters to try next: common consonants not yet tested (R, N, C, D, M, P, etc.) and remaining vowels (I, O, U).

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. One strong choice is ""RESON"":
- R, E, S, O, N
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 3 (allowed).
- Avoids L, A, T.
- Uses new letters R, O, N.

Another option is ""SENOR"" but that's not a valid English word. ""RESON"" is valid.

I'll go with ""RESON"".

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.
- L, A, T are NOT in the word.

From Guess 2 (RESON → R(x) E(-) S(-) O(-) N(-)):
- R is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we have:
Letters confirmed to be in the word: S, E, O, N
Letters confirmed NOT in the word: L, A, T, R

Positions ruled out:
- S: positions 1, 3
- E: positions 2, 5
- O: position 4
- N: position 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, E, O, N (each exactly once, since they’re all distinct)
2. Does not place S in positions 1 or 3, E in positions 2 or 5, O in position 4, or N in position 5.

Let’s list possible positions for each letter:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5

S: can be in 2, 4, or 5
E: can be in 1, 3, or 4
O: can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5
N: can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

We also need one more letter (since we have 4 letters already). The remaining letters must not be L, A, T, R.

Good remaining letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place the letters:

We need to fit S, E, O, N plus one more letter into the 5 positions.

Let’s try to construct a word:

Option 1: Place S in position 2
Then E could be in 1, 3, or 4
O could be in 1, 2, 3, or 5
N could be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

Let’s try:
E S _ _ _
Then we need to place O and N, plus one more letter.

Possible word: E S N O _ (but N can’t be in 3, O can’t be in 4, etc.)

Let’s try:
E S _ N O → positions 1-5: E S _ N O
Check constraints:
- S is in 2 (allowed)
- E is in 1 (allowed)
- N is in 4 (allowed)
- O is in 5 (allowed)
- We need one more letter in position 3.

We need a letter not yet ruled out (not L, A, T, R). Let’s pick C.

So the word would be E S C N O. Is that a valid English word? No.

Try another arrangement.

Let’s try placing O in position 1:
O _ _ _ _
Then S must be in 2, 4, or 5
E must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 1 is taken by O)
N must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 1 is taken by O)

Let’s try:
O N _ _ _
Then S must be in 3, 4, or 5
E must be in 3 or 4
We need one more letter.

Try:
O N E S _ → positions 1-5: O N E S _
Check constraints:
- S is in 4 (allowed)
- E is in 3 (allowed)
- O in 1 (allowed)
- N in 2 (allowed)
- Need a letter for position 5 (not L, A, T, R). Let’s pick C.

S in 2
E must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 1 is O)
N must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 1 is O, 2 is S)
So N could be in 3 or 4
E could be in 3 or 4

Let’s try:
O S N E _ → positions 1-5: O S N E _
Check constraints:
- S is in 2 (allowed)
- E is in 4 (allowed)

O must be in 1, 2, 3, or 5
N must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 4 is S)

After going through many possibilities, the most promising valid word seems to be “SONIC” but that has I, which we haven’t ruled out.

Wait, let’s try “SONIC”:
S O N I C
Check constraints:
- S in 1 (but S can’t be in 1) – invalid.

Try “COONS”:
C O O N S
Check constraints:
- Contains O twice, which is fine.
- S in 5 (allowed)
- E must be in word, but “COONS” has no E – invalid.

Try “SONES”:
S O N E S
Check constraints:
- S in 1 (invalid)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)
- But S is repeated, which might be allowed, but we don’t know.

However, “SONES” has S twice, which is possible, but we don’t know if the word has duplicate letters.

Let’s try “ONES” plus a letter:
We need a 5-letter word with S, E, O, N plus one more letter.

Let’s try “SONIC” again – but S can’t be in 1.

Try “CENSE”:
C E N S E
Check constraints:
- S in 4 (allowed)
- E in 2 (but E can’t be in 2) – invalid.

Try “CENSE” again – same issue.

Try “SENOR” – but that’s not valid.

Try “SENCE”:
S E N C E
Check constraints:
- S in 1 (invalid)
- E in 2 (invalid)

Try “ENOS” plus a letter – but that’s 4 letters.

Let’s try “CONES”:
C O N E S
Check constraints:
- C is new, allowed
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)
- Contains S, E, O, N plus C – valid.

But we don’t know if C is in the word. Since C hasn’t been tested yet, it’s possible.

But let’s see if we can find a word without introducing new letters we haven’t tested.

Wait, we have S, E, O, N plus one more letter. The most common remaining letters are C, D, I, K, M, P, U, etc.

Let’s try “CENSE” – invalid due to E in 2.

Try “CENSE” – same.

Try “PONES”:
P O N E S
Check constraints:
- P is new
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)
- Contains S, E, O, N plus P – valid.

But P hasn’t been tested yet.

Let’s try “PONES”.

But is there a more likely word? Let’s think differently.

We have S, E, O, N plus one more letter. The word must be valid.

Let’s try “SONIC” – but S can’t be in 1.

Try “SONIC” again – invalid.

Try “CONES” – valid.

Let’s go with “CONES” as it’s a common word and fits all constraints.

Check:
C O N E S
- C is new, allowed
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)
- Contains S, E, O, N plus C – valid.

This seems like the best option.Based on the feedback, the secret word contains S, E, O, N and does not contain L, A, T, R. After considering valid 5-letter words, a good next guess is ""CONES"".

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)

Guess 3: CONES -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on CONES:
- C(x) → C is NOT in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- N(-) → N is in the word but in the wrong position (it can't be position 3).
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- S(✓) → S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:
- Word structure: _ O _ E S
- Letters confirmed: O (position 2), E (position 4), S (position 5)
- Letters confirmed NOT in the word: L, A, T, R, C
- Letters still to place: N (must be in position 1 or 3)
- Remaining letters to try: common consonants not yet used (D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y)

We also know N is in the word but not in position 3, so N must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be N O _ E S. The only letter left to fill position 3 must be a consonant not yet ruled out.

Looking at common English words, the most likely candidate is ""NOSES"" but S is already used in position 5. Alternatively, ""NOVES"" but V hasn't been tested yet. However, ""NOVES"" isn't a common word.

Wait, let's list possible consonants for position 3: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Common words fitting N O _ E S:
- NOVES (rare)
- NOSES (invalid, S already used)
- NODES
- NOGES
- NOVES
- NOSES
- NOVES
- NOSES

Looking at these, ""NODES"" is a valid word and fits all constraints:
- N in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 2 (correct)
- D in position 3 (new letter, allowed)
- E in position 4 (correct)
- S in position 5 (correct)Based on the feedback, the word must be _ O _ E S with O in position 2, E in position 4, and S in position 5. N must be in position 1 (since it can't be in position 3), and the remaining letter must be a consonant not yet ruled out. The most likely word is ""NODES"".

From the feedback on NODES:
- N(✓) → N is in position 1 (correct).
- O(✓) → O is in position 2 (correct).
- D(x) → D is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in position 4 (correct).
- S(✓) → S is in position 5 (correct).

So the word structure is now fully determined:
N O _ E S

The only missing letter is the third position. It must be a consonant not yet ruled out (since L, A, T, R, C, D are excluded). Common consonants left include F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

Looking at valid 5-letter words that fit N O _ E S:
- NOVES (but V hasn't been tested yet)
- NOSES (invalid, S already used)
- NOGES (G hasn't been tested)
- NOVES is the most common among these.

Since V hasn't been ruled out and is a common letter, the likely word is NOVES.

However, checking common English words, ""NOVES"" is not standard. The next likely candidate is ""NOSES"" but S is already in position 5. 

Rechecking, the only standard word fitting N O _ E S is ""NOSES"" (but S is repeated). 

Wait, let's consider other consonants:
- N O G E S → ""NOGES"" (rare)
- N O K E S → ""NOKES"" (rare)
- N O M E S → ""NOMES"" (valid, plural of name in some contexts)
- N O P E S → ""NOPES"" (valid, slang for ""nope"")

""NOMES"" and ""NOPES"" are both valid. Between these, ""NOMES"" is more common.

But let's verify:
- N O M E S: letters N, O, M, E, S. M hasn't been ruled out.
- N O P E S: P hasn't been ruled out.

Both fit, but ""NOMES"" is more common. However, let's check if M or P is allowed. Since neither has been ruled out, both are possible.

But since we only have one guess left, we need to choose the most likely. Between ""NOMES"" and ""NOPES"", ""NOMES"" is more common.

But wait, the feedback from previous guesses didn't rule out M or P. So both are possible.

However, looking back at the feedback:
- From NODES, D was ruled out, but M and P weren't.

Given that, the most likely word is ""NOMES"".

But let's think of another: ""NOVES"" is actually a valid word (plural of ""nove"" in some contexts, but rare). 

The most common valid word fitting N O _ E S is ""NOMES"".

But actually, the standard word is ""NOMES"" (plural of name in some languages), but in English, ""NOMES"" is acceptable.

However, let's consider ""NOVES"" is less likely. 

Another check: ""NOVES"" is not in most word lists, but ""NOMES"" is.

Therefore, the best guess is ""NOMES"".
</think>

The word structure is now fully determined: N O _ E S. The missing letter must be a consonant not yet ruled out. The most common valid word fitting this pattern is ""NOMES"".

<guess>NOMES</guess>",NOMES,"From the feedback on NODES:
- N(✓) → N is in position 1 (correct).
- O(✓) → O is in position 2 (correct).
- D(x) → D is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in position 4 (correct).
- S(✓) → S is in position 5 (correct).

So the word structure is now fully determined:
N O _ E S

The only missing letter is the third position. It must be a consonant not yet ruled out (since L, A, T, R, C, D are excluded). Common consonants left include F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

Looking at valid 5-letter words that fit N O _ E S:
- NOVES (but V hasn't been tested yet)
- NOSES (invalid, S already used)
- NOGES (G hasn't been tested)
- NOVES is the most common among these.

Since V hasn't been ruled out and is a common letter, the likely word is NOVES.

However, checking common English words, ""NOVES"" is not standard. The next likely candidate is ""NOSES"" but S is already in position 5. 

Rechecking, the only standard word fitting N O _ E S is ""NOSES"" (but S is repeated). 

Wait, let's consider other consonants:
- N O G E S → ""NOGES"" (rare)
- N O K E S → ""NOKES"" (rare)
- N O M E S → ""NOMES"" (valid, plural of name in some contexts)
- N O P E S → ""NOPES"" (valid, slang for ""nope"")

""NOMES"" and ""NOPES"" are both valid. Between these, ""NOMES"" is more common.

But let's verify:
- N O M E S: letters N, O, M, E, S. M hasn't been ruled out.
- N O P E S: P hasn't been ruled out.

Both fit, but ""NOMES"" is more common. However, let's check if M or P is allowed. Since neither has been ruled out, both are possible.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (uses A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it contains three vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (S, T, L), which should give good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it can't be first).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it can't be last).
- L, A, T are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S and E (and possibly other letters not yet ruled out).
2. Avoids positions 1 for S and 5 for E.
3. Avoids L, A, T.

Good candidate letters to try next: common consonants not yet tested (R, N, C, D, M, P, etc.) and remaining vowels (I, O, U).

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. One strong choice is ""RESON"":
- R, E, S, O, N
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 3 (allowed).
- Avoids L, A, T.
- Uses new letters R, O, N.

Another option is ""SENOR"" but that's not a valid English word. ""RESON"" is valid.

I'll go with ""RESON"".

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)):
- S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.
- L, A, T are NOT in the word.

From Guess 2 (RESON → R(x) E(-) S(-) O(-) N(-)):
- R is NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we have:
Letters confirmed to be in the word: S, E, O, N
Letters confirmed NOT in the word: L, A, T, R

Positions ruled out:
- S: positions 1, 3
- E: positions 2, 5
- O: position 4
- N: position 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, E, O, N (each exactly once, since they’re all distinct)
2. Does not place S in positions 1 or 3, E in positions 2 or 5, O in position 4, or N in position 5.

Let’s list possible positions for each letter:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5

S: can be in 2, 4, or 5
E: can be in 1, 3, or 4
O: can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5
N: can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

We also need one more letter (since we have 4 letters already). The remaining letters must not be L, A, T, R.

Good remaining letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place the letters:

We need to fit S, E, O, N plus one more letter into the 5 positions.

Let’s try to construct a word:

Option 1: Place S in position 2
Then E could be in 1, 3, or 4
O could be in 1, 2, 3, or 5
N could be in 1, 2, 3, or 4

Let’s try:
E S _ _ _
Then we need to place O and N, plus one more letter.

Possible word: E S N O _ (but N can’t be in 3, O can’t be in 4, etc.)

Let’s try:
E S _ N O → positions 1-5: E S _ N O
Check constraints:
- S is in 2 (allowed)
- E is in 1 (allowed)
- N is in 4 (allowed)
- O is in 5 (allowed)
- We need one more letter in position 3.

We need a letter not yet ruled out (not L, A, T, R). Let’s pick C.

So the word would be E S C N O. Is that a valid English word? No.

Try another arrangement.

Let’s try placing O in position 1:
O _ _ _ _
Then S must be in 2, 4, or 5
E must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 1 is taken by O)
N must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but 1 is taken by O)

Let’s try:
O N _ _ _
Then S must be in 3, 4, or 5
E must be in 3 or 4
We need one more letter.

Try:
O N E S _ → positions 1-5: O N E S _
Check constraints:
- S is in 4 (allowed)
- E is in 3 (allowed)
- O in 1 (allowed)

E must be in 1, 3, or 4 (but 1 is O)

So N could be in 3 or 4
E could be in 3 or 4

Let’s try:
O S N E _ → positions 1-5: O S N E _
Check constraints:
- S is in 2 (allowed)

After going through many possibilities, the most promising valid word seems to be “SONIC” but that has I, which we haven’t ruled out.

Wait, let’s try “SONIC”:
S O N I C
Check constraints:
- S in 1 (but S can’t be in 1) – invalid.

Try “COONS”:
C O O N S
Check constraints:
- Contains O twice, which is fine.
- S in 5 (allowed)
- E must be in word, but “COONS” has no E – invalid.

Try “SONES”:
S O N E S
Check constraints:
- S in 1 (invalid)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)
- But S is repeated, which might be allowed, but we don’t know.

However, “SONES” has S twice, which is possible, but we don’t know if the word has duplicate letters.

Let’s try “ONES” plus a letter:
We need a 5-letter word with S, E, O, N plus one more letter.

Let’s try “SONIC” again – but S can’t be in 1.

Try “CENSE”:
C E N S E
Check constraints:
- S in 4 (allowed)
- E in 2 (but E can’t be in 2) – invalid.

Try “CENSE” again – same issue.

Try “SENOR” – but that’s not valid.

Try “SENCE”:
S E N C E
Check constraints:
- S in 1 (invalid)
- E in 2 (invalid)

Try “ENOS” plus a letter – but that’s 4 letters.

Let’s try “CONES”:
C O N E S
Check constraints:
- C is new, allowed
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)
- Contains S, E, O, N plus C – valid.

But we don’t know if C is in the word. Since C hasn’t been tested yet, it’s possible.

But let’s see if we can find a word without introducing new letters we haven’t tested.

Wait, we have S, E, O, N plus one more letter. The most common remaining letters are C, D, I, K, M, P, U, etc.

Let’s try “CENSE” – invalid due to E in 2.

Try “CENSE” – same.

Try “PONES”:
P O N E S
Check constraints:
- P is new
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)
- Contains S, E, O, N plus P – valid.

But P hasn’t been tested yet.

Let’s try “PONES”.

But is there a more likely word? Let’s think differently.

We have S, E, O, N plus one more letter. The word must be valid.

Let’s try “SONIC” – but S can’t be in 1.

Try “SONIC” again – invalid.

Try “CONES” – valid.

Let’s go with “CONES” as it’s a common word and fits all constraints.

Check:
C O N E S
- C is new, allowed
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)
- S in 5 (allowed)
- Contains S, E, O, N plus C – valid.

This seems like the best option.Based on the feedback, the secret word contains S, E, O, N and does not contain L, A, T, R. After considering valid 5-letter words, a good next guess is ""CONES"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: RESON -> FEEDBACK: R(x) E(-) S(-) O(-) N(-)
Guess 3: CONES -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on CONES:
- C(x) → C is NOT in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- N(-) → N is in the word but in the wrong position (it can't be position 3).
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- S(✓) → S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:
- Word structure: _ O _ E S
- Letters confirmed: O (position 2), E (position 4), S (position 5)
- Letters confirmed NOT in the word: L, A, T, R, C
- Letters still to place: N (must be in position 1 or 3)
- Remaining letters to try: common consonants not yet used (D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y)

We also know N is in the word but not in position 3, so N must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be N O _ E S. The only letter left to fill position 3 must be a consonant not yet ruled out.

Looking at common English words, the most likely candidate is ""NOSES"" but S is already used in position 5. Alternatively, ""NOVES"" but V hasn't been tested yet. However, ""NOVES"" isn't a common word.

Wait, let's list possible consonants for position 3: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Common words fitting N O _ E S:
- NOVES (rare)
- NOSES (invalid, S already used)
- NODES
- NOGES
- NOVES
- NOSES
- NOVES
- NOSES

Looking at these, ""NODES"" is a valid word and fits all constraints:
- N in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 2 (correct)
- D in position 3 (new letter, allowed)
- E in position 4 (correct)
- S in position 5 (correct)Based on the feedback, the word must be _ O _ E S with O in position 2, E in position 4, and S in position 5. N must be in position 1 (since it can't be in position 3), and the remaining letter must be a consonant not yet ruled out. The most likely word is ""NODES"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: RESON -> FEEDBACK: R(x) E(-) S(-) O(-) N(-)
Guess 3: CONES -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) N(-) E(✓) S(✓)
Guess 4: NODES -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) O(✓) D(x) E(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on NODES:
- N(✓) → N is in position 1 (correct).
- O(✓) → O is in position 2 (correct).
- D(x) → D is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in position 4 (correct).
- S(✓) → S is in position 5 (correct).

So the word structure is now fully determined:
N O _ E S

The only missing letter is the third position. It must be a consonant not yet ruled out (since L, A, T, R, C, D are excluded). Common consonants left include F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

Looking at valid 5-letter words that fit N O _ E S:
- NOVES (but V hasn't been tested yet)
- NOSES (invalid, S already used)
- NOGES (G hasn't been tested)
- NOVES is the most common among these.

Since V hasn't been ruled out and is a common letter, the likely word is NOVES.

However, checking common English words, ""NOVES"" is not standard. The next likely candidate is ""NOSES"" but S is already in position 5. 

Rechecking, the only standard word fitting N O _ E S is ""NOSES"" (but S is repeated). 

Wait, let's consider other consonants:
- N O G E S → ""NOGES"" (rare)
- N O K E S → ""NOKES"" (rare)
- N O M E S → ""NOMES"" (valid, plural of name in some contexts)
- N O P E S → ""NOPES"" (valid, slang for ""nope"")

""NOMES"" and ""NOPES"" are both valid. Between these, ""NOMES"" is more common.

But let's verify:
- N O M E S: letters N, O, M, E, S. M hasn't been ruled out.
- N O P E S: P hasn't been ruled out.

Both fit, but ""NOMES"" is more common. However, let's check if M or P is allowed. Since neither has been ruled out, both are possible.

But since we only have one guess left, we need to choose the most likely. Between ""NOMES"" and ""NOPES"", ""NOMES"" is more common.

But wait, the feedback from previous guesses didn't rule out M or P. So both are possible.

However, looking back at the feedback:
- From NODES, D was ruled out, but M and P weren't.

Given that, the most likely word is ""NOMES"".

But let's think of another: ""NOVES"" is actually a valid word (plural of ""nove"" in some contexts, but rare). 

The most common valid word fitting N O _ E S is ""NOMES"".

But actually, the standard word is ""NOMES"" (plural of name in some languages), but in English, ""NOMES"" is acceptable.

However, let's consider ""NOVES"" is less likely. 

Another check: ""NOVES"" is not in most word lists, but ""NOMES"" is.

Therefore, the best guess is ""NOMES"".The word structure is now fully determined: N O _ E S. The missing letter must be a consonant not yet ruled out. The most common valid word fitting this pattern is ""NOMES"".
