For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that uses common letters and covers a broad range of vowels and consonants. This helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once. 

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to work with for future guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be first).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be third).
- L, T, and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and A, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively.
- Does NOT contain L, T, or E.
- Must be five letters long.

Let’s pick a word that:
1. Keeps S and A in new positions.
2. Introduces new common consonants and vowels that weren’t ruled out.
3. Avoids L, T, E entirely.

Good candidates: “SPARK”, “CRASH”, “SHARD”, “SANDY”, “SOUND”.

“SPARK” uses:
- S in position 2 (new position).
- A in position 3 (still wrong, so skip).
“CRASH” uses:
- S in position 5 (new position).
- A in position 3 (still wrong, so skip).
“SHARD” uses:
- S in position 1 (ruled out), so skip.
“SANDY” uses:
- S in position 1 (ruled out), so skip.
“SOUND” uses:
- S in position 1 (ruled out), so skip.

Next: “CRASP” – but P is less common.
“DRAWS” – but S in position 5 is fine, and we haven’t used D, R, W yet.

Let’s try “DRAWS”:
- D, R, W are new letters.
- S in position 5 (allowed).
- A in position 2 (new position).

This seems like a good second guess to gather more information.

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - L, T, E are not in the word.

2. DRAWS → D(x) R(x) A(-) W(x) S(✓)
   - D, R, W are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (already knew this).
   - S is in the word and is in position 5 (✓).

So the secret word:
- Ends with S (position 5).
- Contains A, but A is not in positions 2 or 3.
- Does not contain L, T, E, D, R, W.

Remaining letters we can use: A, S (position 5 fixed), and any other consonants not yet ruled out (B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, with A somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but 5 is S), so A must be in position 1 or 4.

Possible patterns:
- A _ _ _ S
- _ _ _ A S

Let’s look for common words fitting these patterns that use only allowed letters.

For A _ _ _ S:
- ACARS (but C, R, S are okay, but R is ruled out)
- ABAND (but ends with D, not S)
- AMASS (but S is already in position 5, and double S might be okay)
- APASS (but P is okay, double S)
- AGASS (G is okay)
- ACHAS (H is okay)
- AFOSS (but O is okay, F is okay, but ends with S, but A is in position 1)

For _ _ _ A S:
- BAGAS (B, G, A, S)
- CAGAS (C, G, A, S)
- FAGAS (F, G, A, S)
- HAGAS (H, G, A, S)
- MAGAS (M, G, A, S)
- NAGAS (N, G, A, S)
- PAGAS (P, G, A, S)
- VAGAS (V, G, A, S)
- XAGAS (X, G, A, S)
- YAGAS (Y, G, A, S)
- ZAGAS (Z, G, A, S)

Among these, ""BAGAS"" and ""CAGAS"" are valid words (though rare), ""NAGAS"" is a proper noun, ""VAGAS"" is Spanish for ""vagabonds"", and ""FAGAS"" is a variant spelling of ""fags"". 

A more common word is ""BAGAS"" (though obscure), ""CAGAS"" is even less common. 

Let’s try ""BAGAS"" as it uses B and G, both new letters, and fits the pattern A _ _ _ S with A in position 1 and S in position 5.

But wait, ""BAGAS"" is A in position 1, B, G, A, S. This would have A in position 1 and 4, which is allowed since A can be in position 4 (as it's not ruled out for position 4). 

However, ""BAGAS"" is not a common word. 

Let me think of other possibilities. 

For _ _ _ A S:
- CAVAS (but V is okay, C, A, V, A, S) – but A is in position 2 and 4, which is allowed.
- FAVAS (F, A, V, A, S)
- HAVAS (H, A, V, A, S)
- LAVAS (but L is ruled out)
- MANDS (but ends with S, and A is in position 2)
- NAPAS (N, A, P, A, S)
- PAVAS (P, A, V, A, S)

""NAPAS"" seems reasonable: N, A, P, A, S. 

Let’s check:
- N: new letter
- A: position 2 (allowed)
- P: new letter
- A: position 4 (allowed)
- S: position 5 (correct)

This seems valid.

Another option is ""CABAS"" (C, A, B, A, S) – but B is okay.

""CABAS"" is a valid word (a type of basket).

Between ""NAPAS"" and ""CABAS"", ""CABAS"" is slightly more common.

Let’s go with ""CABAS"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that uses common letters and covers a broad range of vowels and consonants. This helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once. 

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to work with for future guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be first).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be third).
- L, T, and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and A, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively.
- Does NOT contain L, T, or E.
- Must be five letters long.

Let’s pick a word that:
1. Keeps S and A in new positions.
2. Introduces new common consonants and vowels that weren’t ruled out.
3. Avoids L, T, E entirely.

Good candidates: “SPARK”, “CRASH”, “SHARD”, “SANDY”, “SOUND”.

“SPARK” uses:
- S in position 2 (new position).
- A in position 3 (still wrong, so skip).
“CRASH” uses:
- S in position 5 (new position).
- A in position 3 (still wrong, so skip).
“SHARD” uses:
- S in position 1 (ruled out), so skip.
“SANDY” uses:
- S in position 1 (ruled out), so skip.
“SOUND” uses:
- S in position 1 (ruled out), so skip.

Next: “CRASP” – but P is less common.
“DRAWS” – but S in position 5 is fine, and we haven’t used D, R, W yet.

Let’s try “DRAWS”:
- D, R, W are new letters.
- S in position 5 (allowed).
- A in position 2 (new position).

This seems like a good second guess to gather more information.

<guess>DRAWS</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: DRAWS -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(x) A(-) W(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - L, T, E are not in the word.

2. DRAWS → D(x) R(x) A(-) W(x) S(✓)
   - D, R, W are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (already knew this).
   - S is in the word and is in position 5 (✓).

So the secret word:
- Ends with S (position 5).
- Contains A, but A is not in positions 2 or 3.
- Does not contain L, T, E, D, R, W.

Remaining letters we can use: A, S (position 5 fixed), and any other consonants not yet ruled out (B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, with A somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but 5 is S), so A must be in position 1 or 4.

Possible patterns:
- A _ _ _ S
- _ _ _ A S

Let’s look for common words fitting these patterns that use only allowed letters.

For A _ _ _ S:
- ACARS (but C, R, S are okay, but R is ruled out)
- ABAND (but ends with D, not S)
- AMASS (but S is already in position 5, and double S might be okay)
- APASS (but P is okay, double S)
- AGASS (G is okay)
- ACHAS (H is okay)
- AFOSS (but O is okay, F is okay, but ends with S, but A is in position 1)

For _ _ _ A S:
- BAGAS (B, G, A, S)
- CAGAS (C, G, A, S)
- FAGAS (F, G, A, S)
- HAGAS (H, G, A, S)
- MAGAS (M, G, A, S)
- NAGAS (N, G, A, S)
- PAGAS (P, G, A, S)
- VAGAS (V, G, A, S)
- XAGAS (X, G, A, S)
- YAGAS (Y, G, A, S)
- ZAGAS (Z, G, A, S)

Among these, ""BAGAS"" and ""CAGAS"" are valid words (though rare), ""NAGAS"" is a proper noun, ""VAGAS"" is Spanish for ""vagabonds"", and ""FAGAS"" is a variant spelling of ""fags"". 

A more common word is ""BAGAS"" (though obscure), ""CAGAS"" is even less common. 

Let’s try ""BAGAS"" as it uses B and G, both new letters, and fits the pattern A _ _ _ S with A in position 1 and S in position 5.

But wait, ""BAGAS"" is A in position 1, B, G, A, S. This would have A in position 1 and 4, which is allowed since A can be in position 4 (as it's not ruled out for position 4). 

However, ""BAGAS"" is not a common word. 

Let me think of other possibilities. 

For _ _ _ A S:
- CAVAS (but V is okay, C, A, V, A, S) – but A is in position 2 and 4, which is allowed.
- FAVAS (F, A, V, A, S)
- HAVAS (H, A, V, A, S)
- LAVAS (but L is ruled out)
- MANDS (but ends with S, and A is in position 2)
- NAPAS (N, A, P, A, S)
- PAVAS (P, A, V, A, S)

""NAPAS"" seems reasonable: N, A, P, A, S. 

Let’s check:
- N: new letter
- A: position 2 (allowed)
- P: new letter
- A: position 4 (allowed)
- S: position 5 (correct)

This seems valid.

Another option is ""CABAS"" (C, A, B, A, S) – but B is okay.

""CABAS"" is a valid word (a type of basket).

Between ""NAPAS"" and ""CABAS"", ""CABAS"" is slightly more common.

Let’s go with ""CABAS"".

We still need three letters for positions 1-3, and one of them must be B (since B is in the word but not in position 3).

Possible positions for B: 1 or 2.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that uses common letters and covers a broad range of vowels and consonants. This helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once. 

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to work with for future guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be first).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be third).
- L, T, and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and A, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively.
- Does NOT contain L, T, or E.
- Must be five letters long.

Let’s pick a word that:
1. Keeps S and A in new positions.
2. Introduces new common consonants and vowels that weren’t ruled out.
3. Avoids L, T, E entirely.

Good candidates: “SPARK”, “CRASH”, “SHARD”, “SANDY”, “SOUND”.

“SPARK” uses:
- S in position 2 (new position).
- A in position 3 (still wrong, so skip).
“CRASH” uses:
- S in position 5 (new position).
- A in position 3 (still wrong, so skip).
“SHARD” uses:
- S in position 1 (ruled out), so skip.
“SANDY” uses:
- S in position 1 (ruled out), so skip.
“SOUND” uses:
- S in position 1 (ruled out), so skip.

Next: “CRASP” – but P is less common.
“DRAWS” – but S in position 5 is fine, and we haven’t used D, R, W yet.

Let’s try “DRAWS”:
- D, R, W are new letters.
- S in position 5 (allowed).
- A in position 2 (new position).

This seems like a good second guess to gather more information.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: DRAWS -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(x) A(-) W(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - L, T, E are not in the word.

2. DRAWS → D(x) R(x) A(-) W(x) S(✓)
   - D, R, W are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (already knew this).
   - S is in the word and is in position 5 (✓).

So the secret word:
- Ends with S (position 5).
- Contains A, but A is not in positions 2 or 3.
- Does not contain L, T, E, D, R, W.

Remaining letters we can use: A, S (position 5 fixed), and any other consonants not yet ruled out (B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, with A somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but 5 is S), so A must be in position 1 or 4.

Possible patterns:
- A _ _ _ S
- _ _ _ A S

Let’s look for common words fitting these patterns that use only allowed letters.

For A _ _ _ S:
- ACARS (but C, R, S are okay, but R is ruled out)
- ABAND (but ends with D, not S)
- AMASS (but S is already in position 5, and double S might be okay)
- APASS (but P is okay, double S)
- AGASS (G is okay)
- ACHAS (H is okay)
- AFOSS (but O is okay, F is okay, but ends with S, but A is in position 1)

For _ _ _ A S:
- BAGAS (B, G, A, S)
- CAGAS (C, G, A, S)
- FAGAS (F, G, A, S)
- HAGAS (H, G, A, S)
- MAGAS (M, G, A, S)
- NAGAS (N, G, A, S)
- PAGAS (P, G, A, S)
- VAGAS (V, G, A, S)
- XAGAS (X, G, A, S)
- YAGAS (Y, G, A, S)
- ZAGAS (Z, G, A, S)

Among these, ""BAGAS"" and ""CAGAS"" are valid words (though rare), ""NAGAS"" is a proper noun, ""VAGAS"" is Spanish for ""vagabonds"", and ""FAGAS"" is a variant spelling of ""fags"". 

A more common word is ""BAGAS"" (though obscure), ""CAGAS"" is even less common. 

Let’s try ""BAGAS"" as it uses B and G, both new letters, and fits the pattern A _ _ _ S with A in position 1 and S in position 5.

But wait, ""BAGAS"" is A in position 1, B, G, A, S. This would have A in position 1 and 4, which is allowed since A can be in position 4 (as it's not ruled out for position 4). 

However, ""BAGAS"" is not a common word. 

Let me think of other possibilities. 

For _ _ _ A S:
- CAVAS (but V is okay, C, A, V, A, S) – but A is in position 2 and 4, which is allowed.
- FAVAS (F, A, V, A, S)
- HAVAS (H, A, V, A, S)
- LAVAS (but L is ruled out)
- MANDS (but ends with S, and A is in position 2)
- NAPAS (N, A, P, A, S)
- PAVAS (P, A, V, A, S)

""NAPAS"" seems reasonable: N, A, P, A, S. 

Let’s check:
- N: new letter
- A: position 2 (allowed)
- P: new letter
- A: position 4 (allowed)
- S: position 5 (correct)

This seems valid.

Another option is ""CABAS"" (C, A, B, A, S) – but B is okay.

""CABAS"" is a valid word (a type of basket).

Between ""NAPAS"" and ""CABAS"", ""CABAS"" is slightly more common.

Let’s go with ""CABAS"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)

Guess 3: CABAS -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(-) B(-) A(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's consolidate what we now know:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
   - L, T, E are not in the word.

2. DRAWS → D(x) R(x) A(-) W(x) S(✓)
   - D, R, W are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (already known).
   - S is in the word and is in position 5 (✓).

3. CABAS → C(x) A(-) B(-) A(✓) S(✓)
   - C is not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2 (already known).
   - B is in the word but not in position 3.
   - A is in position 4 (✓).
   - S is in position 5 (✓).

So the secret word:
- Ends with S (position 5).
- A is in position 4.
- B is in the word but not in position 3.
- Letters not in the word: L, T, E, D, R, W, C.

Current pattern: _ _ _ A S
A must be in position 4, S in position 5.

We still need three letters for positions 1-3, and one of them must be B (since B is in the word but not in position 3).

Possible positions for B: 1 or 2.

Let's list possible words:

- B _ _ A S
- _ B _ A S

Letters we can use (not ruled out): A, B, S, plus any other consonants not in {L, T, E, D, R, W, C}. So available consonants: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Vowels: A (already placed), I, O, U.

We need to form common 5-letter words ending in B A S or A B A S.

Possible candidates:
- B _ _ A S:
  - BAGAS (but A in position 2 is allowed, but G is okay)
  - BANAS (N is okay)
  - BIAS (too short)
  - BIBAS (B in position 1 and 3, but B can't be in position 3)
  - BIRAS (R is ruled out)
  - BOKAS (K is okay)
  - BONUS (U is okay)
  - BURAS (R is ruled out)
  - BULAS (L is ruled out)
  - BURAS (R ruled out)
  - BURAS (R ruled out)
  - BURAS (R ruled out)
  - BURAS (R ruled out)

- _ B _ A S:
  - F B _ A S (FBAS is not a word)
  - M B _ A S (MBAS is not a word)
  - N B _ A S (NBAS is not a word)
  - P B _ A S (PBAS is not a word)
  - G B _ A S (GBAS is not a word)
  - H B _ A S (HBAS is not a word)
  - V B _ A S (VBAS is not a word)

Looking at common words, ""BANAS"" seems possible (B, A, N, A, S). But A is in position 2, which is allowed.

""BANAS"" uses:
- B in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- N in position 3 (new letter)
- A in position 4 (correct)
- S in position 5 (correct)

This fits all constraints.

Another candidate is ""BOKAS"" (B, O, K, A, S), but ""BOKAS"" is less common.

""BANAS"" is more likely.

Let's check:
- B: not ruled out
- A: position 2 (allowed)
- N: not ruled out
- A: position 4 (correct)
- S: position 5 (correct)

This seems valid.

From all feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word, not in position 1
   - A is in the word, not in positions 2, 3
   - L, T, E are absent

2. DRAWS → D(x) R(x) A(-) W(x) S(✓)
   - D, R, W are absent
   - S is in position 5 (✓)

3. CABAS → C(x) A(-) B(-) A(✓) S(✓)
   - C is absent
   - A is in position 4 (✓)
   - B is in the word, not in position 3
   - S is in position 5 (✓)

4. BANAS → B(-) A(-) N(x) A(✓) S(✓)
   - B is in the word, not in position 1
   - A is in position 2, but we know A cannot be in position 2 (from SLATE feedback)
   - N is absent
   - A is in position 4 (✓)
   - S is in position 5 (✓)

So the pattern is:
- Position 5: S
- Position 4: A
- B must appear somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (since it cannot be in 1 or 3)
- Letters absent: L, T, E, D, R, W, C, N

Possible patterns:
- _ B _ A S
- _ _ B A S

We need common 5-letter words fitting these patterns using allowed letters.

For _ B _ A S:
- F B _ A S → FBAS is not a word
- M B _ A S → MBAS is not a word
- P B _ A S → PBAS is not a word
- G B _ A S → GBAS is not a word
- H B _ A S → HBAS is not a word
- V B _ A S → VBAS is not a word

For _ _ B A S:
- F _ B A S → FOBAS is not a word
- M _ B A S → MIBAS is not a word
- P _ B A S → PIBAS is not a word
- G _ B A S → GOBAS is not a word
- H _ B A S → HOBAS is not a word
- V _ B A S → VOBAS is not a word

Looking at common words, ""FOBAS"" is not valid. Let's think differently.

Wait, we know:
- B must be in position 2 or 3
- A is in position 4
- S is in position 5
- B cannot be in position 1 or 3

So possible positions for B: 2
Thus the pattern is:
- _ B _ A S

Now we need to fill position 1 and 3 with allowed letters (not L, T, E, D, R, W, C, N).

Allowed letters: A, B, S, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

But A is already in position 4, S is in 5, B is in 2. So positions 1 and 3 must be from remaining letters.

Looking for common words:
- F B I A S → FIBAS is not a word
- F B O A S → FOBAS is not a word
- F B U A S → FUBAS is not a word
- G B I A S → GIBAS is not a word
- G B O A S → GOBAS is not a word
- M B I A S → MIBAS is not a word
- M B O A S → MOBAS is not a word
- P B I A S → PIBAS is not a word
- P B O A S → POBAS is not a word
- H B I A S → HIBAS is not a word
- H B O A S → HOBAS is not a word
- V B I A S → VIBAS is not a word
- V B O A S → VOBAS is not a word

This seems problematic. Let's check if we missed any letters.

Wait, we have:
- B must be in position 2
- Pattern: _ B _ A S
- Allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: any not in absent list.

Looking at valid 5-letter words ending in B A S:
- FIBAS (not valid)
- GIBAS (not valid)
- MOBAS (not valid)
- PIBAS (not valid)
- VIBAS (not valid)
- HIBAS (not valid)
- GOBAS (not valid)

Actually, the word ""FOBAS"" is not valid. Let's think of ""FOBAS"" as not valid.

Wait, maybe the word is ""FOBAS"" but that's not valid. Let's think differently.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|>

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that uses common letters and covers a broad range of vowels and consonants. This helps eliminate or confirm many possibilities at once. 

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to work with for future guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be first).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be third).
- L, T, and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and A, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively.
- Does NOT contain L, T, or E.
- Must be five letters long.

Let’s pick a word that:
1. Keeps S and A in new positions.
2. Introduces new common consonants and vowels that weren’t ruled out.
3. Avoids L, T, E entirely.

Good candidates: “SPARK”, “CRASH”, “SHARD”, “SANDY”, “SOUND”.

“SPARK” uses:
- S in position 2 (new position).
- A in position 3 (still wrong, so skip).
“CRASH” uses:
- S in position 5 (new position).
- A in position 3 (still wrong, so skip).
“SHARD” uses:
- S in position 1 (ruled out), so skip.
“SANDY” uses:
- S in position 1 (ruled out), so skip.
“SOUND” uses:
- S in position 1 (ruled out), so skip.

Next: “CRASP” – but P is less common.
“DRAWS” – but S in position 5 is fine, and we haven’t used D, R, W yet.

Let’s try “DRAWS”:
- D, R, W are new letters.
- S in position 5 (allowed).
- A in position 2 (new position).

This seems like a good second guess to gather more information.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: DRAWS -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(x) A(-) W(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - L, T, E are not in the word.

2. DRAWS → D(x) R(x) A(-) W(x) S(✓)
   - D, R, W are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (already knew this).
   - S is in the word and is in position 5 (✓).

So the secret word:
- Ends with S (position 5).
- Contains A, but A is not in positions 2 or 3.
- Does not contain L, T, E, D, R, W.

Remaining letters we can use: A, S (position 5 fixed), and any other consonants not yet ruled out (B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S, with A somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but 5 is S), so A must be in position 1 or 4.

Possible patterns:
- A _ _ _ S
- _ _ _ A S

Let’s look for common words fitting these patterns that use only allowed letters.

For A _ _ _ S:
- ACARS (but C, R, S are okay, but R is ruled out)
- ABAND (but ends with D, not S)
- AMASS (but S is already in position 5, and double S might be okay)
- APASS (but P is okay, double S)
- AGASS (G is okay)
- ACHAS (H is okay)
- AFOSS (but O is okay, F is okay, but ends with S, but A is in position 1)

For _ _ _ A S:
- BAGAS (B, G, A, S)
- CAGAS (C, G, A, S)
- FAGAS (F, G, A, S)
- HAGAS (H, G, A, S)
- MAGAS (M, G, A, S)
- NAGAS (N, G, A, S)
- PAGAS (P, G, A, S)
- VAGAS (V, G, A, S)
- XAGAS (X, G, A, S)
- YAGAS (Y, G, A, S)
- ZAGAS (Z, G, A, S)

Among these, ""BAGAS"" and ""CAGAS"" are valid words (though rare), ""NAGAS"" is a proper noun, ""VAGAS"" is Spanish for ""vagabonds"", and ""FAGAS"" is a variant spelling of ""fags"". 

A more common word is ""BAGAS"" (though obscure), ""CAGAS"" is even less common. 

Let’s try ""BAGAS"" as it uses B and G, both new letters, and fits the pattern A _ _ _ S with A in position 1 and S in position 5.

But wait, ""BAGAS"" is A in position 1, B, G, A, S. This would have A in position 1 and 4, which is allowed since A can be in position 4 (as it's not ruled out for position 4). 

However, ""BAGAS"" is not a common word. 

Let me think of other possibilities. 

For _ _ _ A S:
- CAVAS (but V is okay, C, A, V, A, S) – but A is in position 2 and 4, which is allowed.
- FAVAS (F, A, V, A, S)
- HAVAS (H, A, V, A, S)
- LAVAS (but L is ruled out)
- MANDS (but ends with S, and A is in position 2)
- NAPAS (N, A, P, A, S)
- PAVAS (P, A, V, A, S)

""NAPAS"" seems reasonable: N, A, P, A, S. 

Let’s check:
- N: new letter
- A: position 2 (allowed)
- P: new letter
- A: position 4 (allowed)
- S: position 5 (correct)

This seems valid.

Another option is ""CABAS"" (C, A, B, A, S) – but B is okay.

""CABAS"" is a valid word (a type of basket).

Between ""NAPAS"" and ""CABAS"", ""CABAS"" is slightly more common.

Let’s go with ""CABAS"".

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's consolidate what we now know:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
   - L, T, E are not in the word.

2. DRAWS → D(x) R(x) A(-) W(x) S(✓)
   - D, R, W are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (already known).
   - S is in the word and is in position 5 (✓).

3. CABAS → C(x) A(-) B(-) A(✓) S(✓)
   - C is not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2 (already known).
   - B is in the word but not in position 3.
   - A is in position 4 (✓).
   - S is in position 5 (✓).

So the secret word:
- Ends with S (position 5).
- A is in position 4.
- B is in the word but not in position 3.
- Letters not in the word: L, T, E, D, R, W, C.

Current pattern: _ _ _ A S
A must be in position 4, S in position 5.

We still need three letters for positions 1-3, and one of them must be B (since B is in the word but not in position 3).

Possible positions for B: 1 or 2.

Let's list possible words:

- B _ _ A S
- _ B _ A S

Letters we can use (not ruled out): A, B, S, plus any other consonants not in {L, T, E, D, R, W, C}. So available consonants: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Vowels: A (already placed), I, O, U.

We need to form common 5-letter words ending in B A S or A B A S.

Possible candidates:
- B _ _ A S:
  - BAGAS (but A in position 2 is allowed, but G is okay)
  - BANAS (N is okay)
  - BIAS (too short)
  - BIBAS (B in position 1 and 3, but B can't be in position 3)
  - BIRAS (R is ruled out)
  - BOKAS (K is okay)
  - BONUS (U is okay)
  - BURAS (R is ruled out)
  - BULAS (L is ruled out)
  - BURAS (R ruled out)
  - BURAS (R ruled out)
  - BURAS (R ruled out)
  - BURAS (R ruled out)

- _ B _ A S:
  - F B _ A S (FBAS is not a word)
  - M B _ A S (MBAS is not a word)
  - N B _ A S (NBAS is not a word)
  - P B _ A S (PBAS is not a word)
  - G B _ A S (GBAS is not a word)
  - H B _ A S (HBAS is not a word)
  - V B _ A S (VBAS is not a word)

Looking at common words, ""BANAS"" seems possible (B, A, N, A, S). But A is in position 2, which is allowed.

""BANAS"" uses:
- B in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- N in position 3 (new letter)
- A in position 4 (correct)
- S in position 5 (correct)

This fits all constraints.

Another candidate is ""BOKAS"" (B, O, K, A, S), but ""BOKAS"" is less common.

""BANAS"" is more likely.

Let's check:
- B: not ruled out
- A: position 2 (allowed)
- N: not ruled out
- A: position 4 (correct)
- S: position 5 (correct)

This seems valid.

Let’s re-summarize everything we now know.

Letters that are in the word (and their constraints):
- A is in position 4 (✓ from CABAS and BANAS).
- S is in position 5 (✓ from CABAS and BANAS).
- B is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from CABAS and BANAS).

Letters that are NOT in the word:
L, T, E, D, R, W, C, N.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ A S, and one of the first three positions must be B.

Possible positions for B:
- Position 1: B _ _ A S
- Position 2: _ B _ A S
- Position 3: _ _ B A S  (but B is not allowed in position 3, so this is impossible)

Thus, B must be in position 1 or 2.

Letters left to place (positions 1-3, excluding B):
From the remaining alphabet (excluding L, T, E, D, R, W, C, N), we have: F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a valid 5-letter word of the form:
- B _ _ A S
- _ B _ A S

Let’s list common English words that fit these patterns:

1. B _ _ A S
   - BAGAS (not common)
   - BIAS (too short)
   - BIBAS (invalid, B in position 3)
   - BOKAS (not common)
   - BULAS (invalid, L ruled out)

2. _ B _ A S
   - F B _ A S → no common word
   - G B _ A S → no common word
   - H B _ A S → no common word
   - I B _ A S → no common word
   - M B _ A S → no common word
   - P B _ A S → no common word
   - V B _ A S → no common word

The only plausible candidate is BAGAS, but it’s obscure. Another possibility is BOKAS, which is also rare.

However, looking back, we might have missed a simpler word. Let’s re-examine the pattern.

Another approach: think of 5-letter words ending in BAS (positions 3-5) and containing B in position 1 or 2.

Valid words:
- BAGAS
- BIBAS (invalid, B in position 3)
- BOKAS
- BULAS (invalid, L ruled out)

Among these, BAGAS is the most likely, despite being uncommon.

Therefore, the next logical guess is BAGAS.

Letters that are NOT in the word:

So the pattern is: _ _ _ A S, and one of the first three positions must be B.

Possible positions for B:
- Position 1: B _ _ A S

Thus, B must be in position 1 or 2.

   - BAGAS (not common)
   - BIAS (too short)
   - BIBAS (invalid, B in position 3)
   - BOKAS (not common)
   - BULAS (invalid, L ruled out)

2. _ B _ A S
   - F B _ A S → no common word
   - G B _ A S → no common word
   - H B _ A S → no common word
   - I B _ A S → no common word
   - M B _ A S → no common word
   - P B _ A S → no common word
   - V B _ A S → no common word

The only plausible candidate is BAGAS, but it’s obscure. Another possibility is BOKAS, which is also rare.

However, looking back, we might have missed a simpler word. Let’s re-examine the pattern.

Another approach: think of 5-letter words ending in BAS (positions 3-5) and containing B in position 1 or 2.

Valid words:
- BAGAS
- BIBAS (invalid, B in position 3)
- BOKAS
- BULAS (invalid, L ruled out)

Among these, BAGAS is the most likely, despite being uncommon.

Therefore, the next logical guess is BAGAS.",Guess 6: BAGAS -> FEEDBACK: B(-) A(-) G(x) A(✓) S(✓),FAIL
