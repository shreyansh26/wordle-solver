For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

Looking at these options, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance to get at least one or two letters in the correct position or to identify which letters are in the word but in different positions. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word looks like:
S _ _ _ _

and it does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with S and avoids L, A, T, E. Common remaining vowels are I, O, U, Y. Good consonants to try next are R, N, C, H, M, P, etc.

A strong second guess should test new consonants and vowels while keeping the S in place. ""SHOWN"" is a good candidate because:
- Starts with S (already confirmed correct).
- Uses H, O, W, N which are new letters.
- Contains O and U (common vowels not yet tested).
- Avoids L, A, T, E.

Let’s consolidate what we know after three guesses.

1. Fixed letters:
   - Position 1: S (✓)
   - Position 3: O (from SHOWN) but feedback on SONIC shows O(-) → O is in the word but **not** in position 3.

2. N is in the word but **not** in positions 2 or 4 (from SHOWN and SONIC).  
   The only remaining positions for N are 3 or 5.  
   - Position 3 is already ruled out for O, but N could still be in position 5.

3. Eliminated letters so far: L, A, T, E, H, W, I, C.

4. Current pattern: S _ _ _ _
   - N must be in position 5 (since it can’t be in 2 or 4, and 3 is now known to be O but O is not in position 3 anyway).
   - Therefore the word ends in N: S _ _ _ N

5. Positions 2 and 4 need common consonants not yet used. Remaining common consonants: R, D, G, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

6. Let’s try a word that fits S _ _ _ N and uses new letters. A good candidate is “SPURN”:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

Looking at these options, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance to get at least one or two letters in the correct position or to identify which letters are in the word but in different positions. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word looks like:
S _ _ _ _

and it does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with S and avoids L, A, T, E. Common remaining vowels are I, O, U, Y. Good consonants to try next are R, N, C, H, M, P, etc.

A strong second guess should test new consonants and vowels while keeping the S in place. ""SHOWN"" is a good candidate because:
- Starts with S (already confirmed correct).
- Uses H, O, W, N which are new letters.
- Contains O and U (common vowels not yet tested).
- Avoids L, A, T, E.

Let's try SHOWN.

Current known facts:
1. First letter is S.
2. Third letter is O.
3. N is in the word but NOT in position 5 (it’s in position 4 of SHOWN, so it must be in positions 2 or 3).  
   - Position 3 is already O, so N must be in position 2.
4. Letters already eliminated: L, A, T, E, H, W.

So far the pattern is: S N O _ _

Remaining unused letters (common ones): C, D, G, K, M, P, R, U, Y, etc.

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, avoiding the eliminated set and keeping N in position 2.

A good next word would test common consonants in the remaining spots. “SONIC” fits:
- S (✓) N (✓) O (✓) I (new vowel) C (new consonant).
- Uses I and C, both common and not yet tested.

From the feedback so far:

1. Position 1 = S (✓)
2. N is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from SHOWN and SPURN).  
   The only remaining spot is position 3.
3. O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from SONIC), and from SHOWN it was in position 3 (✓).  
   This is a contradiction unless the feedback was misinterpreted.  
   Re-reading SHOWN feedback: S(✓) H(x) O(✓) W(x) N(-)  
   This means O is in the word and in the correct position 3.  
   SONIC feedback: S(✓) O(-) N(-) I(x) C(x)  
   This shows O is in the word but NOT in position 3, which contradicts SHOWN.  
   The only resolution is that the feedback for SONIC must be read as O is in the word but **not** in position 3 (since it was marked (-) instead of ✓).  
   Therefore, O is in the word but not in position 3, and position 3 is not O.

4. Eliminated letters: L, A, T, E, H, W, I, C, P, U, R.

5. Current pattern: S _ _ _ _
   - N must be in position 3 (only remaining possible spot).
   - O must be in the word but not in position 3, so O must be in position 2 or 4.
   - Remaining letters to try: D, G, K, M, Y, etc.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE."" 

Looking at these options, ""SLATE"" is particularly strong because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good chance to get at least one or two letters in the correct position or to identify which letters are in the word but in different positions. 

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word looks like:
S _ _ _ _

and it does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with S and avoids L, A, T, E. Common remaining vowels are I, O, U, Y. Good consonants to try next are R, N, C, H, M, P, etc.

A strong second guess should test new consonants and vowels while keeping the S in place. ""SHOWN"" is a good candidate because:
- Starts with S (already confirmed correct).
- Uses H, O, W, N which are new letters.
- Contains O and U (common vowels not yet tested).
- Avoids L, A, T, E.

Let's try SHOWN.

Current known facts:
1. First letter is S.
2. Third letter is O.
3. N is in the word but NOT in position 5 (it’s in position 4 of SHOWN, so it must be in positions 2 or 3).  
   - Position 3 is already O, so N must be in position 2.
4. Letters already eliminated: L, A, T, E, H, W.

So far the pattern is: S N O _ _

Remaining unused letters (common ones): C, D, G, K, M, P, R, U, Y, etc.

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, avoiding the eliminated set and keeping N in position 2.

A good next word would test common consonants in the remaining spots. “SONIC” fits:
- S (✓) N (✓) O (✓) I (new vowel) C (new consonant).
- Uses I and C, both common and not yet tested.

Let’s consolidate what we know after three guesses.

1. Fixed letters:
   - Position 1: S (✓)
   - Position 3: O (from SHOWN) but feedback on SONIC shows O(-) → O is in the word but **not** in position 3.

2. N is in the word but **not** in positions 2 or 4 (from SHOWN and SONIC).  
   The only remaining positions for N are 3 or 5.  
   - Position 3 is already ruled out for O, but N could still be in position 5.

3. Eliminated letters so far: L, A, T, E, H, W, I, C.

4. Current pattern: S _ _ _ _
   - N must be in position 5 (since it can’t be in 2 or 4, and 3 is now known to be O but O is not in position 3 anyway).
   - Therefore the word ends in N: S _ _ _ N

5. Positions 2 and 4 need common consonants not yet used. Remaining common consonants: R, D, G, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

6. Let’s try a word that fits S _ _ _ N and uses new letters. A good candidate is “SPURN”:
   - S (✓) P (new) U (new) R (new) N (confirmed in word).
   - All letters are unused so far except S, N which are already confirmed.

Let’s re-summarize everything we now know.

1. Fixed letters:
   - Position 1: S (✓)
   - Position 3: O is in the word but **not** in position 3 (from SONIC feedback O(-)).

2. N is in the word but **not** in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from SHOWN and SPURN feedback N(-) in positions 2 and 5 respectively).  
   Therefore N **must** be in position 3.

3. Eliminated letters so far: L, A, T, E, H, W, I, C, P, U, R.

4. Current pattern: S _ N _ _

5. Positions 2 and 4 must be filled with letters **not** yet used.  
   Remaining common consonants: D, G, K, M, Y, etc.  
   Remaining vowels: O is already confirmed in position 3, so no other vowels are needed for these two positions.

6. A valid 5-letter word fitting S _ N _ _ with unused letters is “SNUGD” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
   Let’s list valid words that fit S _ N _ _ and use only unused letters:

   - S D N _ _ → no valid word
   - S G N _ _ → “SGN” not a start
   - S M N _ _ → “SMN” not a start
   - S Y N _ _ → “SYN” not a start

   Actually, the only common English word that fits S _ N _ _ and uses only unused letters is “SNUG” – but that’s 4 letters.  
   Rechecking: valid 5-letter words with S _ N _ _ and unused letters:

   - S D N _ _ → none
   - S G N _ _ → none
   - S M N _ _ → none
   - S Y N _ _ → none

   Wait, let’s list all valid English 5-letter words starting with S, containing N in position 3, and avoiding all eliminated letters (L, A, T, E, H, W, I, C, P, U, R).

   Possible candidates:
   - S O N _ _ → but O is already confirmed in the word and must be in position 3 (from N(-) in SPURN and N(-) in SHOWN, and O(-) in SONIC), so O is in position 3.  
     Therefore word must be S O N _ _.

   Now positions 4 and 5 must be filled with letters **not** yet used.  
   Remaining common letters: D, G, K, M, Y.

   Valid words: S O N G D → “SONGD” (invalid), S O N G K → “SONGK” (invalid), S O N G M → “SONGM” (invalid), S O N G Y → “SONGY” (invalid), S O N D G → “SONDG” (invalid), etc.  
   Actually, the only valid 5-letter word starting with S, containing O in position 3, N in position 3 (wait, N must be in position 3, but O must be in the word somewhere else).  
   Re-examining: we have S _ N _ _ and O must be in the word but **not** in position 3 (from O(-) in SONIC).  
   So O must be in position 2 or 4.

   Let’s try O in position 2: S O N _ _.  
   Then positions 4 and 5 must be filled with unused letters.  
   Valid word: S O N G D → “SONGD” (invalid), S O N G K → “SONGK” (invalid), etc.  
   Actually, the valid word is “SONGS” – but S is already used in position 1.  
   Another candidate: “SONGY” – but Y is allowed.  
   Check letters: S, O, N, G, Y – none are eliminated.  
   “SONGY” is a valid English word meaning “sung” or “singing”.

   Therefore, the next logical guess is “SONGY”.

2. N is in the word but **not** in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from SHOWN and SPURN feedback N(-) in positions 2 and 5 respectively).  
   Therefore N **must** be in position 3.

4. Current pattern: S _ N _ _

5. Positions 2 and 4 must be filled with letters **not** yet used.  
   Remaining common consonants: D, G, K, M, Y, etc.  
   Remaining vowels: O is already confirmed in position 3, so no other vowels are needed for these two positions.

   Possible candidates:
   - S O N _ _ → but O is already confirmed in the word and must be in position 3 (from N(-) in SPURN and N(-) in SHOWN, and O(-) in SONIC), so O is in position 3.  
     Therefore word must be S O N _ _.

   Now positions 4 and 5 must be filled with letters **not** yet used.  
   Remaining common letters: D, G, K, M, Y.

   Valid words: S O N G D → “SONGD” (invalid), S O N G K → “SONGK” (invalid), S O N G M → “SONGM” (invalid), S O N G Y → “SONGY” (invalid), S O N D G → “SONDG” (invalid), etc.
