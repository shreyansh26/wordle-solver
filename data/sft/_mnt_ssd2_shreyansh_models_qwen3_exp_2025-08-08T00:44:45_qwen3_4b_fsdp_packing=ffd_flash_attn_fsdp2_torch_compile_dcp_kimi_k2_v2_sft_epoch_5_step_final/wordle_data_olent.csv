Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S are NOT in the word (x).
- O and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains the letters O and E, but O is not in position 3 and E is not in position 5.

2. Introduces other common letters that weren’t in AROSE (like T, N, I, L, C, etc.).
3. Avoids the already-eliminated letters A, R, S.

A good candidate is “TOWER”:
- T, W, R are new letters (R was already eliminated, so this is bad).  
Wait, R was eliminated, so “TOWER” is invalid.

Next candidate: “EIGHT”
- Uses E and I (I wasn’t in AROSE).
- E is now in position 1 (was in position 5 before).
- G, H, T are new letters.

But we know O is in the word, so “EIGHT” misses O.

Better: “PEONY”

- P, N, Y are new letters.

But Y is less common. Let’s try “EPOCH”:

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants.

From the new feedback on OILED:

- O(✓) : O is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- I(x) : I is not in the word at all.
- L(-) : L is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 3).
- E(-) : E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 4).
- D(x) : D is not in the word.

So we now know:
1. Word starts with O.
2. Letters definitely in the word: O (position 1), L, E.
3. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, S, P, C, H, I, D.
4. L is not in position 3.
5. E is not in position 4.

We need to place L and E in the remaining positions (2, 3, 4, 5), respecting the constraints.

Positions left: 2, 3, 4, 5.
- L cannot be in position 3.
- E cannot be in position 4.

Let’s list possible positions for L and E:

Possible positions for L: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 2, 3, 5

We need to pick a word that:
- Starts with O.
- Contains L and E.
- Does not use any eliminated letters.
- Uses common remaining letters (T, N, U, Y, etc.).

Let’s try to place L and E in the remaining slots.

Option 1:
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: L (but L cannot be in 3, so invalid)

Option 2:
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: E
- Then positions 4 and 5 need to be filled with new letters.

Word structure: O L E _ _

We need two more distinct letters (not yet used and not eliminated).

Remaining common letters: T, N, U, Y.

Let’s try “OLENT”:
- O(1) L(2) E(3) N(4) T(5)
- Checks all constraints:
  - Starts with O.
  - Contains L and E.
  - L not in 3 (it’s in 2), E not in 4 (it’s in 3).
  - No eliminated letters used.

But “OLENT” is not a valid English word.

Next option: “OLEAN” – but A is eliminated.

Next: “OLENT” invalid.

Next: “OLEPT” – P is eliminated.

Next: “OLEUT” – not a word.

Next: “OLENT” invalid.

Let’s try a different arrangement.

Option 3:
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: L (but L cannot be in 3, invalid)

Option 4:
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: L (invalid)

Option 5:
- Position 2: L
- Position 4: E
- Then positions 3 and 5 need new letters.

Word structure: O L _ E _

Need two new letters for positions 3 and 5.

Possible letters: T, N, U, Y.

Try “OLYME” – but M is not yet eliminated, but we need to check if M is allowed. Actually, M hasn’t been used, but we don’t have info on it. However, we need to avoid eliminated letters. Since M hasn’t been eliminated, it’s allowed.

But “OLYME” is not a valid word.

Try “OLUTE” – not a word.

Try “OLYNE” – not a word.

Try “OLITE” – not a word.

Try “OLVET” – V not eliminated, but not a word.

Try “OLNET” – not a word.

Alternative approach: let’s list possible 5-letter words starting with O, containing L and E, avoiding eliminated letters.

Possible words:
- OLENT – invalid
- OLENT – invalid
- OLIVE – but I is eliminated.
- OLDER – D is eliminated.
- OLEUM – U is allowed, but M not eliminated, but not a word.
- OLEUM – not valid.
- OLEUM – not valid.

Wait, “OLIVE” is invalid because I is eliminated.

Next: “OLENT” invalid.

Next: “OLEPT” invalid.

Next: “OLEUT” invalid.

Next: “OLENT” invalid.

Let’s try a different arrangement.

Option 12:

- Position 3: L
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: T

Word: O N L E T – valid word!

Check constraints:
- Starts with O.
- Contains L and E.
- L is in position 3 – but earlier feedback said L is in the word but not in position 3 (from OILED feedback: L(-) means L is in the word but not in position 3). So this is invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S are NOT in the word (x).
- O and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains the letters O and E, but O is not in position 3 and E is not in position 5.

To maximize information, I want a new word that:
1. Uses the known letters O and E in new positions.
2. Introduces other common letters that weren’t in AROSE (like T, N, I, L, C, etc.).
3. Avoids the already-eliminated letters A, R, S.

A good candidate is “TOWER”:
- T, W, R are new letters (R was already eliminated, so this is bad).  
Wait, R was eliminated, so “TOWER” is invalid.

Next candidate: “EIGHT”
- Uses E and I (I wasn’t in AROSE).
- E is now in position 1 (was in position 5 before).
- G, H, T are new letters.

But we know O is in the word, so “EIGHT” misses O.

Better: “PEONY”
- Uses O and E in new positions (O in 2, E in 3).
- P, N, Y are new letters.

But Y is less common. Let’s try “EPOCH”:
- E in position 1, O in position 2.
- C, H, P are new letters.

This seems optimal: keeps O and E in new positions and introduces three new common consonants.

Guess 2: EPOCH -> FEEDBACK: E(-) P(x) O(-) C(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   - Letters eliminated: A, R, S
   - Letters confirmed: O and E (both in the word but not in their original positions)

2. EPOCH → E(-) P(x) O(-) C(x) H(x)
   - Letters eliminated: P, C, H
   - Letters confirmed: O and E (positions updated)

Current constraints:
- The word contains O and E.
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 2 (from EPOCH).
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 1 (from EPOCH).

So:
- O must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

We also know the letters A, R, S, P, C, H are out.

We need three more distinct letters (not yet eliminated) to fill the remaining slots.

Common remaining letters: D, I, L, N, T, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place O and E in new positions and fill with new letters.

Option: O in position 1, E in position 3
Word structure: O _ E _ _
Possible letters: D, I, L, N, T, U, Y

Let’s try “OILED”:
- O in 1 (allowed), E in 3 (allowed)
- Letters: I, L, D are new and not yet eliminated
- Word is valid 5-letter English word.

Check constraints:
- O not in 2 or 3 (OK, it’s in 1)
- E not in 1 or 5 (OK, it’s in 3)
- No eliminated letters (A, R, S, P, C, H) used

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S are NOT in the word (x).
- O and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains the letters O and E, but O is not in position 3 and E is not in position 5.

To maximize information, I want a new word that:
1. Uses the known letters O and E in new positions.
2. Introduces other common letters that weren’t in AROSE (like T, N, I, L, C, etc.).
3. Avoids the already-eliminated letters A, R, S.

A good candidate is “TOWER”:
- T, W, R are new letters (R was already eliminated, so this is bad).  
Wait, R was eliminated, so “TOWER” is invalid.

Next candidate: “EIGHT”
- Uses E and I (I wasn’t in AROSE).
- E is now in position 1 (was in position 5 before).
- G, H, T are new letters.

But we know O is in the word, so “EIGHT” misses O.

Better: “PEONY”
- Uses O and E in new positions (O in 2, E in 3).
- P, N, Y are new letters.

But Y is less common. Let’s try “EPOCH”:
- E in position 1, O in position 2.
- C, H, P are new letters.

This seems optimal: keeps O and E in new positions and introduces three new common consonants.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: EPOCH -> FEEDBACK: E(-) P(x) O(-) C(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   - Letters eliminated: A, R, S
   - Letters confirmed: O and E (both in the word but not in their original positions)

2. EPOCH → E(-) P(x) O(-) C(x) H(x)
   - Letters eliminated: P, C, H
   - Letters confirmed: O and E (positions updated)

Current constraints:
- The word contains O and E.
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 2 (from EPOCH).
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 1 (from EPOCH).

So:
- O must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- E must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

We also know the letters A, R, S, P, C, H are out.

We need three more distinct letters (not yet eliminated) to fill the remaining slots.

Common remaining letters: D, I, L, N, T, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place O and E in new positions and fill with new letters.

Option: O in position 1, E in position 3
Word structure: O _ E _ _
Possible letters: D, I, L, N, T, U, Y

Let’s try “OILED”:
- O in 1 (allowed), E in 3 (allowed)
- Letters: I, L, D are new and not yet eliminated
- Word is valid 5-letter English word.

Check constraints:
- O not in 2 or 3 (OK, it’s in 1)
- E not in 1 or 5 (OK, it’s in 3)
- No eliminated letters (A, R, S, P, C, H) used

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   - Eliminated letters: A, R, S
   - Confirmed letters: O and E (both in the word, but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively)

   - Eliminated letters: P, C, H
   - Confirmed letters: O and E (positions updated)

3. OILED → O(✓) I(x) L(-) E(-) D(x)
   - O is now in the correct position (position 1)
   - Eliminated letters: I, D
   - L is in the word but not in position 3
   - E is in the word but not in position 4

Current constraints:
- Word starts with O.
- Contains E and L (but E not in positions 4 or 5, and L not in position 3).
- Eliminated letters so far: A, R, S, P, C, H, I, D.
- Remaining common letters: B, F, G, J, K, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to place E and L in valid positions and fill the remaining slots with unused letters.

Possible positions:
- O _ _ _ _
- E can be in positions 2 or 3 (since it can't be in 1, 4, or 5)
- L can be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (since it can't be in 1 or 3)

Let's try:
- O _ E _ L (E in 3, L in 5)
- Remaining letters: B, F, G, J, K, M, N, T, U, V, W, Y, Z.

A valid word fitting this pattern: O B E L L (but B is allowed, and it's a valid word).

Check constraints:
- O in 1 (✓)
- E in 3 (allowed)
- L in 5 (allowed)
- No eliminated letters used.

- L must be in position 2 or 4 (cannot be 1,3,5)
- No other constraints on remaining letters

Possible patterns:
- O L E _ _  (L in 2)

- O L E _ _  → OLEUM (but U is allowed), OLENT (not a word), OLEAK (not common)
- O _ E L _  → OXEL_ (not common), OXELN (not a word), OXELM (not a word), OXELT (not a word), OXELB (B is eliminated), OXELG (not a word), OXELK (not a word)

Wait, let's list valid words:
- OLEUM (U is allowed)
- OXEL_ doesn't seem valid
- OXEL is not a common prefix

Another approach: check valid words starting with O E _ _ _ but E is fixed at 3, so O _ E _ _

Actually, pattern is O _ E _ _

We need:
- Position 2: any allowed letter
- Position 4: any allowed letter
- Position 5: any allowed letter
