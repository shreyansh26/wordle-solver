### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can provide good coverage across the alphabet. This helps maximize information gain for subsequent guesses.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word and their positions:
- S is in position 1 (✓).
- A is in position 3 (✓).

Letters that are in the word but not yet placed:
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (-).

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- R, O, E, N, T.

So the pattern so far is:
S _ A _ _

And the remaining letters must include L somewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5).

Possible letters left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding R, O, E, N, T).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Has A in position 3.
3. Contains L somewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5).
4. Uses only the remaining letters.

Looking for common combinations:
- S L A _ _ → SLACK (but C is allowed, K is allowed) – but K is allowed.
- S _ A L _ → S C A L E – but E is excluded.
- S _ A _ L → S P A C L – not a word.
- S _ A _ _ with L in position 2: S L A _ _ – SLACK is valid.
- S _ A _ _ with L in position 4: S _ A L _ – S C A L E (invalid due to E), S P A L _ – SPALE? Not valid.
- S _ A _ _ with L in position 5: S _ A _ L – S P A C L – not valid, S P A C E – E excluded.

SLACK seems the best fit:
- S in position 1 (✓).

- L in position 2 (-) – which is allowed since L is in the word but not in position 2 yet (feedback said L is in the word but not in position 2).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can provide good coverage across the alphabet. This helps maximize information gain for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in the first position.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the fourth position.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: R, O, E.
- Letters to include: A (not in position 1), S (not in position 4).

Next guess should:
1. Use the confirmed letters A and S.
2. Avoid R, O, E.
3. Place A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Place S somewhere other than position 4.

A good candidate is “SLANT”:
- Uses S and A.
- Avoids R, O, E.
- S is in position 1 (allowed).
- A is in position 3 (allowed).
- New letters L, N, T can help narrow things down.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SLANT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word and their positions:
- S is in position 1 (✓).
- A is in position 3 (✓).

Letters that are in the word but not yet placed:
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (-).

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- R, O, E, N, T.

So the pattern so far is:
S _ A _ _

And the remaining letters must include L somewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5).

Possible letters left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding R, O, E, N, T).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Has A in position 3.
3. Contains L somewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5).
4. Uses only the remaining letters.

Looking for common combinations:
- S L A _ _ → SLACK (but C is allowed, K is allowed) – but K is allowed.
- S _ A L _ → S C A L E – but E is excluded.
- S _ A _ L → S P A C L – not a word.
- S _ A _ _ with L in position 2: S L A _ _ – SLACK is valid.
- S _ A _ _ with L in position 4: S _ A L _ – S C A L E (invalid due to E), S P A L _ – SPALE? Not valid.
- S _ A _ _ with L in position 5: S _ A _ L – S P A C L – not valid, S P A C E – E excluded.

SLACK seems the best fit:
- S in position 1 (✓).
- A in position 3 (✓).
- L in position 2 (-) – which is allowed since L is in the word but not in position 2 yet (feedback said L is in the word but not in position 2).
- C and K are new letters to test.

So the next guess is SLACK.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, T, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can provide good coverage across the alphabet. This helps maximize information gain for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in the first position.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the fourth position.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: R, O, E.
- Letters to include: A (not in position 1), S (not in position 4).

Next guess should:
1. Use the confirmed letters A and S.
2. Avoid R, O, E.
3. Place A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Place S somewhere other than position 4.

A good candidate is “SLANT”:
- Uses S and A.
- Avoids R, O, E.
- S is in position 1 (allowed).
- A is in position 3 (allowed).
- New letters L, N, T can help narrow things down.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SLANT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word and their positions:
- S is in position 1 (✓).
- A is in position 3 (✓).

Letters that are in the word but not yet placed:
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (-).

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- R, O, E, N, T.

So the pattern so far is:
S _ A _ _

And the remaining letters must include L somewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5).

Possible letters left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding R, O, E, N, T).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Has A in position 3.
3. Contains L somewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5).
4. Uses only the remaining letters.

Looking for common combinations:
- S L A _ _ → SLACK (but C is allowed, K is allowed) – but K is allowed.
- S _ A L _ → S C A L E – but E is excluded.
- S _ A _ L → S P A C L – not a word.
- S _ A _ _ with L in position 2: S L A _ _ – SLACK is valid.
- S _ A _ _ with L in position 4: S _ A L _ – S C A L E (invalid due to E), S P A L _ – SPALE? Not valid.
- S _ A _ _ with L in position 5: S _ A _ L – S P A C L – not valid, S P A C E – E excluded.

SLACK seems the best fit:
- S in position 1 (✓).
- A in position 3 (✓).
- L in position 2 (-) – which is allowed since L is in the word but not in position 2 yet (feedback said L is in the word but not in position 2).
- C and K are new letters to test.

So the next guess is SLACK.

Current known facts:

1. Fixed letters:
   - Position 1: S (✓)
   - Position 3: A (✓)

2. Letters in the word but not yet placed:
   - L (from both guesses 2 and 3, it always showed “-” so L is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4)

3. Letters NOT in the word:
   - R, O, E, N, T, C, K

4. Pattern so far:
   S _ A _ _

5. L must therefore appear in position 5 (since positions 2 and 4 are excluded).

6. Remaining letters that are still allowed (not yet ruled out):
   B, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

7. We need a 5-letter word of the form S _ A _ L.

   Common English words fitting this pattern:
   - SPALL
   - SWALL (not valid)
   - SVALA (not valid)
   - SPALL is the only valid word left.

   SPALL:
   - S (✓) in position 1
   - P (new letter)
   - A (✓) in position 3
   - L (must be in position 5, so position 4 is empty)
   - L (✓) in position 5

   All constraints satisfied.
