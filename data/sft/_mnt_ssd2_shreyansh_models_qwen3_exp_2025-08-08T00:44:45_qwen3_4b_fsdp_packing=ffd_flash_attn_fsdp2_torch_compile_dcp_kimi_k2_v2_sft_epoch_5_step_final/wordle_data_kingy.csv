1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A commonly recommended starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are among the most frequent in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, so each letter's placement can be evaluated independently

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet while keeping the word valid and common.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates 5 very common letters.  
To maximize information in the next guess, we want a word that:
1. Uses entirely new, common letters (not A, R, O, S, E).
2. Contains a good mix of vowels and consonants.
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U, Y (since A, E, O are out).

A strong candidate is “UNTIL”:
- Letters: U, N, T, I, L – none have been tried yet.
- Contains 2 new vowels (U, I) and 3 new consonants (N, T, L).
- Common and valid word.

Another candidate could be “UNITY”, but “UNTIL” has slightly more consonants which might give better coverage.

From the two guesses we know:

1. Letters that are **not** in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L  
2. Letters that **are** in the word but in the **wrong positions**:
   - N is in the word but **not** in position 2 (because it was marked “-” in position 2 of UNTIL).
   - I is in the word but **not** in position 4 (because it was marked “-” in position 4 of UNTIL).

So the secret word must contain both N and I, and must not contain any of the eliminated letters above.  
We also know the positions of N and I are wrong, so we can avoid placing them in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

Remaining common letters (not yet eliminated): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the still-allowed vowels Y and (possibly) U, but U is already eliminated.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains N and I.
- Does **not** contain any of A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L.
- Places N **not** in position 2 and I **not** in position 4.

Let’s list possible candidates:
- BINGO – contains B, I, N, G, O → O is eliminated.
- CHINK – contains C, H, I, N, K → all letters allowed, and positions: I is in 3 (not 4), N is in 4 (not 2) – valid.
- MINKY – contains M, I, N, K, Y → all letters allowed, positions: I in 3, N in 3 (but N must appear once, so this is fine) – valid.
- WINDY – contains W, I, N, D, Y → all letters allowed, positions: I in 3, N in 3 – valid.

Among these, “CHINK” seems to use the most common remaining consonants (C, H, K) and fits the constraints perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess is CHINK.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are **not** in the word at all:
A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, C, H

Letters that **are** in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- I (must appear, but not in positions 3 or 4)
- N (must appear, but not in positions 2 or 4)
- K (must appear, but not in position 5)

Remaining letters we haven’t ruled out:
B, D, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the still-allowed vowels Y (and possibly others).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains I, N, K exactly once each.
2. Does **not** contain any of the eliminated letters.
3. Places I **not** in positions 3 or 4, N **not** in positions 2 or 4, and K **not** in position 5.

Let’s list possible positions for each required letter:
- I: can be in positions 1, 2, or 5
- N: can be in positions 1, 3, or 5
- K: can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

We also need two more distinct letters from the remaining pool (B, D, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Let’s try to construct a valid word:

Option 1: I in position 1
   Word pattern: I _ _ _ _
   Need N and K in positions 2,3,4,5 with constraints:
   - N cannot be in 2 or 4 → possible positions: 3 or 5
   - K cannot be in 5 → possible positions: 2,3,4
   - We also need two more letters from the remaining pool.

   Let’s try N in 3 and K in 2:
   I K N _ _
   Need two more letters from remaining pool. Let’s pick D and G.
   Possible word: I K N D G → “INKDG” – not a valid word.
   Try another arrangement: I N K _ _ → N in 2 is invalid (N cannot be in 2).  
   Try I K _ N _ → K in 2, N in 4 is invalid (N cannot be in 4).  
   Try I K _ _ N → K in 2, N in 5: I K _ _ N → need two letters.  
   I K B D N → “IKBDN” – invalid.  
   I K M D N → “IKMDN” – invalid.  
   I K D M N → “IKDMN” – invalid.  
   It seems hard to form a valid word with I in position 1.

Option 2: I in position 2
   Word pattern: _ I _ _ _
   Need N and K in positions 1,3,4,5 with constraints:
   - N cannot be in 2 or 4 → possible positions: 1,3,5
   - K cannot be in 5 → possible positions: 1,3,4
   - We also need one more letter from the remaining pool.

   Let’s try N in 1 and K in 3:
   N I K _ _
   Need two more letters. Let’s pick D and G:
   N I K D G → “NIKDG” – invalid.
   Try N I K _ _ with remaining letters: N I K B D → “NIKBD” – invalid.

   Try N in 3 and K in 1:

   K B N I D → “KBNID” – invalid.

   Try N in 5 and K in 3:
   _ I K _ N

   Need two more letters. Let’s pick B and D:
   K B D I N → “KBDIN” – invalid.

Option 3: I in position 5
   Word pattern: _ _ _ _ I
   Need N and K in positions 1,2,3,4 with constraints:
   - N cannot be in 2 or 4 → possible positions: 1,3
   - K cannot be in 5 (already satisfied) and cannot be in 5, so positions: 1,2,3,4
   - We also need two more letters from the remaining pool.

   Let’s try N in 3 and K in 1:
   K _ N _ I
   Need one more letter. Let’s pick B:
   K B N D I → “KBN D I” – invalid.

   Try N in 3 and K in 2:

   It seems challenging to form a valid word with the constraints. Let’s try a different approach.

   Another valid word that fits all constraints:
   - Contains I, N, K
   - Does not contain any eliminated letters
   - Places I in position 2, N in position 3, K in position 4
   - Needs one more letter in position 1.

   Let’s pick B for position 1:
   B I N K _ → need a fifth letter. We have B I N K I – invalid (I already used).  
   We need a new letter. Let’s pick D:
   B I N K D → “BIN K D” – invalid.

   Try Z in position 1:

   Try M in position 1:
   M I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick D:
   M I N K D → “MIN K D” – invalid.

   It seems no valid 5-letter word fits all constraints. Let’s re-examine.

   Actually, let’s list a valid word that contains I, N, K and meets all constraints:
   - Must contain I, N, K
   - Must not contain any of A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, C, H
   - Must place I not in 3 or 4, N not in 2 or 4, K not in 5

   A valid word that fits: “INKY” is 4 letters, so no.

   Another valid word: “INK” is 3 letters.

   Wait, let’s try “MINKY” – but that’s 5 letters and contains M, I, N, K, Y:
   - Letters: M, I, N, K, Y – none are eliminated.
   - I is in position 2 (not 3 or 4) – ok.
   - N is in position 3 (not 2 or 4) – ok.
   - K is in position 4 (not 5) – ok.

   “MINKY” is a valid 5-letter word.

   Let’s verify:
   - Contains I, N, K – yes.
   - No eliminated letters – yes.
   - I not in 3 or 4 – yes (it’s in 2).
   - N not in 2 or 4 – yes (it’s in 3).
   - K not in 5 – yes (it’s in 4).

   Therefore, the next guess is MINKY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A commonly recommended starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are among the most frequent in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, so each letter's placement can be evaluated independently

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet while keeping the word valid and common.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates 5 very common letters.  
To maximize information in the next guess, we want a word that:
1. Uses entirely new, common letters (not A, R, O, S, E).
2. Contains a good mix of vowels and consonants.
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U, Y (since A, E, O are out).

A strong candidate is “UNTIL”:
- Letters: U, N, T, I, L – none have been tried yet.
- Contains 2 new vowels (U, I) and 3 new consonants (N, T, L).
- Common and valid word.

Another candidate could be “UNITY”, but “UNTIL” has slightly more consonants which might give better coverage.  
Let’s go with “UNTIL”.

From the two guesses we know:

1. Letters that are **not** in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L  
2. Letters that **are** in the word but in the **wrong positions**:
   - N is in the word but **not** in position 2 (because it was marked “-” in position 2 of UNTIL).
   - I is in the word but **not** in position 4 (because it was marked “-” in position 4 of UNTIL).

So the secret word must contain both N and I, and must not contain any of the eliminated letters above.  
We also know the positions of N and I are wrong, so we can avoid placing them in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

Remaining common letters (not yet eliminated): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the still-allowed vowels Y and (possibly) U, but U is already eliminated.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains N and I.
- Does **not** contain any of A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L.
- Places N **not** in position 2 and I **not** in position 4.

Let’s list possible candidates:
- BINGO – contains B, I, N, G, O → O is eliminated.
- CHINK – contains C, H, I, N, K → all letters allowed, and positions: I is in 3 (not 4), N is in 4 (not 2) – valid.
- MINKY – contains M, I, N, K, Y → all letters allowed, positions: I in 3, N in 3 (but N must appear once, so this is fine) – valid.
- WINDY – contains W, I, N, D, Y → all letters allowed, positions: I in 3, N in 3 – valid.

Among these, “CHINK” seems to use the most common remaining consonants (C, H, K) and fits the constraints perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess is CHINK.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are **not** in the word at all:
A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, C, H

Letters that **are** in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- I (must appear, but not in positions 3 or 4)
- N (must appear, but not in positions 2 or 4)
- K (must appear, but not in position 5)

Remaining letters we haven’t ruled out:
B, D, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the still-allowed vowels Y (and possibly others).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains I, N, K exactly once each.
2. Does **not** contain any of the eliminated letters.
3. Places I **not** in positions 3 or 4, N **not** in positions 2 or 4, and K **not** in position 5.

Let’s list possible positions for each required letter:
- I: can be in positions 1, 2, or 5
- N: can be in positions 1, 3, or 5
- K: can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

We also need two more distinct letters from the remaining pool (B, D, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Let’s try to construct a valid word:

Option 1: I in position 1
   Word pattern: I _ _ _ _
   Need N and K in positions 2,3,4,5 with constraints:
   - N cannot be in 2 or 4 → possible positions: 3 or 5
   - K cannot be in 5 → possible positions: 2,3,4
   - We also need two more letters from the remaining pool.

   Let’s try N in 3 and K in 2:
   I K N _ _
   Need two more letters from remaining pool. Let’s pick D and G.
   Possible word: I K N D G → “INKDG” – not a valid word.
   Try another arrangement: I N K _ _ → N in 2 is invalid (N cannot be in 2).  
   Try I K _ N _ → K in 2, N in 4 is invalid (N cannot be in 4).  
   Try I K _ _ N → K in 2, N in 5: I K _ _ N → need two letters.  
   I K B D N → “IKBDN” – invalid.  
   I K M D N → “IKMDN” – invalid.  
   I K D M N → “IKDMN” – invalid.  
   It seems hard to form a valid word with I in position 1.

Option 2: I in position 2
   Word pattern: _ I _ _ _
   Need N and K in positions 1,3,4,5 with constraints:
   - N cannot be in 2 or 4 → possible positions: 1,3,5
   - K cannot be in 5 → possible positions: 1,3,4
   - We also need one more letter from the remaining pool.

   Let’s try N in 1 and K in 3:
   N I K _ _
   Need two more letters. Let’s pick D and G:
   N I K D G → “NIKDG” – invalid.
   Try N I K _ _ with remaining letters: N I K B D → “NIKBD” – invalid.

   Try N in 3 and K in 1:
   K _ N I _
   Need one more letter. Let’s pick B:
   K B N I _ → “KBN I _” – need fifth letter.  
   K B N I D → “KBNID” – invalid.

   Try N in 5 and K in 3:
   _ I K _ N
   Need one more letter. Let’s pick B:
   B I K D N → “BIKDN” – invalid.

   Try N in 5 and K in 4:
   _ I _ K N
   Need one more letter. Let’s pick B:
   B I D K N → “BIDKN” – invalid.

   Try N in 5 and K in 1:
   K _ _ I N
   Need two more letters. Let’s pick B and D:
   K B D I N → “KBDIN” – invalid.

Option 3: I in position 5
   Word pattern: _ _ _ _ I
   Need N and K in positions 1,2,3,4 with constraints:
   - N cannot be in 2 or 4 → possible positions: 1,3
   - K cannot be in 5 (already satisfied) and cannot be in 5, so positions: 1,2,3,4
   - We also need two more letters from the remaining pool.

   Let’s try N in 3 and K in 1:
   K _ N _ I
   Need one more letter. Let’s pick B:
   K B N D I → “KBN D I” – invalid.

   Try N in 3 and K in 2:
   _ K N _ I
   Need one more letter. Let’s pick B:
   B K N D I → “BKNDI” – invalid.

   Try N in 1 and K in 3:
   N _ K _ I
   Need one more letter. Let’s pick B:
   N B K D I → “N BK D I” – invalid.

   Try N in 1 and K in 4:
   N _ _ K I
   Need one more letter. Let’s pick B:
   N B D K I → “NBDKI” – invalid.

   Try N in 3 and K in 4:
   _ _ N K I
   Need two more letters. Let’s pick B and D:
   B D N K I → “BDNKI” – invalid.

   Try N in 3 and K in 2:
   _ K N _ I
   Need one more letter. Let’s pick B:
   B K N D I → “BKNDI” – invalid.

   Try N in 1 and K in 2:
   N K _ _ I
   Need two more letters. Let’s pick B and D:
   N K B D I → “NKBDI” – invalid.

   Try N in 3 and K in 1:
   K _ N _ I
   Need one more letter. Let’s pick B:
   K B N D I → “KBN D I” – invalid.

   It seems challenging to form a valid word with the constraints. Let’s try a different approach.

   Another valid word that fits all constraints:
   - Contains I, N, K
   - Does not contain any eliminated letters
   - Places I in position 2, N in position 3, K in position 4
   - Needs one more letter in position 1.

   Let’s pick B for position 1:
   B I N K _ → need a fifth letter. We have B I N K I – invalid (I already used).  
   We need a new letter. Let’s pick D:
   B I N K D → “BIN K D” – invalid.

   Try M in position 1:
   M I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick D:
   M I N K D → “MIN K D” – invalid.

   Try D in position 1:
   D I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick B:
   D I N K B → “DIN K B” – invalid.

   Try G in position 1:
   G I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick B:
   G I N K B → “GIN K B” – invalid.

   Try P in position 1:
   P I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick B:
   P I N K B → “PIN K B” – invalid.

   Try Y in position 1:
   Y I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick B:
   Y I N K B → “YIN K B” – invalid.

   Try J in position 1:
   J I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick B:
   J I N K B → “JIN K B” – invalid.

   Try W in position 1:
   W I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick B:
   W I N K B → “WIN K B” – invalid.

   Try Z in position 1:
   Z I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick B:
   Z I N K B → “ZIN K B” – invalid.

   Try F in position 1:
   F I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick B:
   F I N K B → “FIN K B” – invalid.

   Try V in position 1:
   V I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick B:
   V I N K B → “VIN K B” – invalid.

   Try Q in position 1:
   Q I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick B:
   Q I N K B → “QIN K B” – invalid.

   Try X in position 1:
   X I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick B:
   X I N K B → “XIN K B” – invalid.

   Try M in position 1:
   M I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick D:
   M I N K D → “MIN K D” – invalid.

   It seems no valid 5-letter word fits all constraints. Let’s re-examine.

   Actually, let’s list a valid word that contains I, N, K and meets all constraints:
   - Must contain I, N, K
   - Must not contain any of A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, C, H
   - Must place I not in 3 or 4, N not in 2 or 4, K not in 5

   A valid word that fits: “INKY” is 4 letters, so no.

   Another valid word: “INK” is 3 letters.

   Wait, let’s try “MINKY” – but that’s 5 letters and contains M, I, N, K, Y:
   - Letters: M, I, N, K, Y – none are eliminated.
   - I is in position 2 (not 3 or 4) – ok.
   - N is in position 3 (not 2 or 4) – ok.
   - K is in position 4 (not 5) – ok.

   “MINKY” is a valid 5-letter word.

   Let’s verify:
   - Contains I, N, K – yes.
   - No eliminated letters – yes.
   - I not in 3 or 4 – yes (it’s in 2).
   - N not in 2 or 4 – yes (it’s in 3).
   - K not in 5 – yes (it’s in 4).

   Therefore, the next guess is MINKY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A commonly recommended starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are among the most frequent in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct, so each letter's placement can be evaluated independently

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet while keeping the word valid and common.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates 5 very common letters.  
To maximize information in the next guess, we want a word that:
1. Uses entirely new, common letters (not A, R, O, S, E).
2. Contains a good mix of vowels and consonants.
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U, Y (since A, E, O are out).

A strong candidate is “UNTIL”:
- Letters: U, N, T, I, L – none have been tried yet.
- Contains 2 new vowels (U, I) and 3 new consonants (N, T, L).
- Common and valid word.

Another candidate could be “UNITY”, but “UNTIL” has slightly more consonants which might give better coverage.  
Let’s go with “UNTIL”.

Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we know:

1. Letters that are **not** in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L  
2. Letters that **are** in the word but in the **wrong positions**:
   - N is in the word but **not** in position 2 (because it was marked “-” in position 2 of UNTIL).
   - I is in the word but **not** in position 4 (because it was marked “-” in position 4 of UNTIL).

So the secret word must contain both N and I, and must not contain any of the eliminated letters above.  
We also know the positions of N and I are wrong, so we can avoid placing them in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

Remaining common letters (not yet eliminated): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the still-allowed vowels Y and (possibly) U, but U is already eliminated.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains N and I.
- Does **not** contain any of A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L.
- Places N **not** in position 2 and I **not** in position 4.

Let’s list possible candidates:
- BINGO – contains B, I, N, G, O → O is eliminated.
- CHINK – contains C, H, I, N, K → all letters allowed, and positions: I is in 3 (not 4), N is in 4 (not 2) – valid.
- MINKY – contains M, I, N, K, Y → all letters allowed, positions: I in 3, N in 3 (but N must appear once, so this is fine) – valid.
- WINDY – contains W, I, N, D, Y → all letters allowed, positions: I in 3, N in 3 – valid.

Among these, “CHINK” seems to use the most common remaining consonants (C, H, K) and fits the constraints perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess is CHINK.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are **not** in the word at all:
A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, C, H

Letters that **are** in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- I (must appear, but not in positions 3 or 4)
- N (must appear, but not in positions 2 or 4)
- K (must appear, but not in position 5)

Remaining letters we haven’t ruled out:
B, D, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the still-allowed vowels Y (and possibly others).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains I, N, K exactly once each.
2. Does **not** contain any of the eliminated letters.
3. Places I **not** in positions 3 or 4, N **not** in positions 2 or 4, and K **not** in position 5.

Let’s list possible positions for each required letter:
- I: can be in positions 1, 2, or 5
- N: can be in positions 1, 3, or 5
- K: can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

We also need two more distinct letters from the remaining pool (B, D, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Let’s try to construct a valid word:

Option 1: I in position 1
   Word pattern: I _ _ _ _
   Need N and K in positions 2,3,4,5 with constraints:
   - N cannot be in 2 or 4 → possible positions: 3 or 5
   - K cannot be in 5 → possible positions: 2,3,4
   - We also need two more letters from the remaining pool.

   Let’s try N in 3 and K in 2:
   I K N _ _
   Need two more letters from remaining pool. Let’s pick D and G.
   Possible word: I K N D G → “INKDG” – not a valid word.
   Try another arrangement: I N K _ _ → N in 2 is invalid (N cannot be in 2).  
   Try I K _ N _ → K in 2, N in 4 is invalid (N cannot be in 4).  
   Try I K _ _ N → K in 2, N in 5: I K _ _ N → need two letters.  
   I K B D N → “IKBDN” – invalid.  
   I K M D N → “IKMDN” – invalid.  
   I K D M N → “IKDMN” – invalid.  
   It seems hard to form a valid word with I in position 1.

Option 2: I in position 2
   Word pattern: _ I _ _ _
   Need N and K in positions 1,3,4,5 with constraints:
   - N cannot be in 2 or 4 → possible positions: 1,3,5
   - K cannot be in 5 → possible positions: 1,3,4
   - We also need one more letter from the remaining pool.

   Let’s try N in 1 and K in 3:
   N I K _ _
   Need two more letters. Let’s pick D and G:
   N I K D G → “NIKDG” – invalid.
   Try N I K _ _ with remaining letters: N I K B D → “NIKBD” – invalid.

   Try N in 3 and K in 1:
   K _ N I _
   Need one more letter. Let’s pick B:
   K B N I _ → “KBN I _” – need fifth letter.  
   K B N I D → “KBNID” – invalid.

   Try N in 5 and K in 3:
   _ I K _ N
   Need one more letter. Let’s pick B:
   B I K D N → “BIKDN” – invalid.

   Try N in 5 and K in 4:
   _ I _ K N
   Need one more letter. Let’s pick B:
   B I D K N → “BIDKN” – invalid.

   Try N in 5 and K in 1:
   K _ _ I N
   Need two more letters. Let’s pick B and D:
   K B D I N → “KBDIN” – invalid.

Option 3: I in position 5
   Word pattern: _ _ _ _ I
   Need N and K in positions 1,2,3,4 with constraints:
   - N cannot be in 2 or 4 → possible positions: 1,3
   - K cannot be in 5 (already satisfied) and cannot be in 5, so positions: 1,2,3,4
   - We also need two more letters from the remaining pool.

   Let’s try N in 3 and K in 1:
   K _ N _ I
   Need one more letter. Let’s pick B:
   K B N D I → “KBN D I” – invalid.

   Try N in 3 and K in 2:
   _ K N _ I
   Need one more letter. Let’s pick B:
   B K N D I → “BKNDI” – invalid.

   Try N in 1 and K in 3:
   N _ K _ I
   Need one more letter. Let’s pick B:
   N B K D I → “N BK D I” – invalid.

   Try N in 1 and K in 4:
   N _ _ K I
   Need one more letter. Let’s pick B:
   N B D K I → “NBDKI” – invalid.

   Try N in 3 and K in 4:
   _ _ N K I
   Need two more letters. Let’s pick B and D:
   B D N K I → “BDNKI” – invalid.

   Try N in 3 and K in 2:
   _ K N _ I
   Need one more letter. Let’s pick B:
   B K N D I → “BKNDI” – invalid.

   Try N in 1 and K in 2:
   N K _ _ I
   Need two more letters. Let’s pick B and D:
   N K B D I → “NKBDI” – invalid.

   Try N in 3 and K in 1:
   K _ N _ I
   Need one more letter. Let’s pick B:
   K B N D I → “KBN D I” – invalid.

   It seems challenging to form a valid word with the constraints. Let’s try a different approach.

   Another valid word that fits all constraints:
   - Contains I, N, K
   - Does not contain any eliminated letters
   - Places I in position 2, N in position 3, K in position 4
   - Needs one more letter in position 1.

   Let’s pick B for position 1:
   B I N K _ → need a fifth letter. We have B I N K I – invalid (I already used).  
   We need a new letter. Let’s pick D:
   B I N K D → “BIN K D” – invalid.

   Try M in position 1:
   M I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick D:
   M I N K D → “MIN K D” – invalid.

   Try D in position 1:
   D I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick B:
   D I N K B → “DIN K B” – invalid.

   Try G in position 1:
   G I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick B:
   G I N K B → “GIN K B” – invalid.

   Try P in position 1:
   P I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick B:
   P I N K B → “PIN K B” – invalid.

   Try Y in position 1:
   Y I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick B:
   Y I N K B → “YIN K B” – invalid.

   Try J in position 1:
   J I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick B:
   J I N K B → “JIN K B” – invalid.

   Try W in position 1:
   W I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick B:
   W I N K B → “WIN K B” – invalid.

   Try Z in position 1:
   Z I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick B:
   Z I N K B → “ZIN K B” – invalid.

   Try F in position 1:
   F I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick B:
   F I N K B → “FIN K B” – invalid.

   Try V in position 1:
   V I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick B:
   V I N K B → “VIN K B” – invalid.

   Try Q in position 1:
   Q I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick B:
   Q I N K B → “QIN K B” – invalid.

   Try X in position 1:
   X I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick B:
   X I N K B → “XIN K B” – invalid.

   Try M in position 1:
   M I N K _ → need a fifth letter. Let’s pick D:
   M I N K D → “MIN K D” – invalid.

   It seems no valid 5-letter word fits all constraints. Let’s re-examine.

   Actually, let’s list a valid word that contains I, N, K and meets all constraints:
   - Must contain I, N, K
   - Must not contain any of A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, C, H
   - Must place I not in 3 or 4, N not in 2 or 4, K not in 5

   A valid word that fits: “INKY” is 4 letters, so no.

   Another valid word: “INK” is 3 letters.

   Wait, let’s try “MINKY” – but that’s 5 letters and contains M, I, N, K, Y:
   - Letters: M, I, N, K, Y – none are eliminated.
   - I is in position 2 (not 3 or 4) – ok.
   - N is in position 3 (not 2 or 4) – ok.
   - K is in position 4 (not 5) – ok.

   “MINKY” is a valid 5-letter word.

   Let’s verify:
   - Contains I, N, K – yes.
   - No eliminated letters – yes.
   - I not in 3 or 4 – yes (it’s in 2).
   - N not in 2 or 4 – yes (it’s in 3).
   - K not in 5 – yes (it’s in 4).

   Therefore, the next guess is MINKY.

From the feedback so far:

So the pattern is:

and K must appear in position 4 (the only remaining spot).

But wait, the feedback for DINKY showed K(-) in position 4, meaning K is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
That leaves only position 1 for K, but DINKY’s feedback already showed K(-) in position 4, and we also saw K(-) in position 4 of MINKY.  
This implies K must be in position 1.
