For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting words in Wordle often include vowels and frequently used consonants. A good first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback:
- S, L, A, E are NOT in the word (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word contains the letter T somewhere other than the 4th position (since T was in position 4 in SLATE and marked “-”).  
The remaining letters we have not tested yet include:  
- Common consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc.  
- Vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are ruled out).

A good second guess should:
1. Re-use the letter T in a new position.
2. Introduce several new, common letters to test.

A strong candidate is “TRIUM” (but M is less common).  
“TRIOT” (but repeats T).  
“TRUNK” (tests R, U, N, K).  
“TRIPE” (but E is already ruled out).  
“TRIAD” (but A is ruled out).

Best choice: “TRUNK” – it places T in position 1, tests R, U, N, K, none of which have been ruled out yet.

   - N (cannot be in position 4)  

3. Still-unused common letters that could help:  
   I, O, D, G, B, F, M, Y, W, V, etc.

We need a word that:
- Contains T, U, N (each in a new position).  
- Uses none of the eliminated letters.  
- Places T in position 2 or 3 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out).  
- Places U in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since 3 is ruled out).  
- Places N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since 4 is ruled out).  

A good candidate is “DUMPY”:
- D, M, Y are new letters.  
- T is in position 2 (allowed).  
- U is in position 3 → but position 3 is ruled out for U (from CHUMP feedback).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting words in Wordle often include vowels and frequently used consonants. A good first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- S, L, A, E are NOT in the word (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word contains the letter T somewhere other than the 4th position (since T was in position 4 in SLATE and marked “-”).  
The remaining letters we have not tested yet include:  
- Common consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc.  
- Vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are ruled out).

A good second guess should:
1. Re-use the letter T in a new position.
2. Introduce several new, common letters to test.

A strong candidate is “TRIUM” (but M is less common).  
“TRIOT” (but repeats T).  
“TRUNK” (tests R, U, N, K).  
“TRIPE” (but E is already ruled out).  
“TRIAD” (but A is ruled out).

Best choice: “TRUNK” – it places T in position 1, tests R, U, N, K, none of which have been ruled out yet.

Guess 2: TRUNK -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(x) U(-) N(-) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E  
   – Letter T is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. TRUNK → T(-) R(x) U(-) N(-) K(x)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: R, K  
   – Letter T is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   – Letters U and N are in the word but in wrong positions.

So we know:
- T is somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4).  
- U and N are somewhere in the word, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.  
- Still-untested common letters: I, O, D, C, H, M, P, B, F, G, Y.

A good next guess should:
- Place T in a new position (e.g., position 3).  
- Re-test U and N in new positions.  
- Introduce several new, common letters.

Candidate word: “CHUMP”  
- Tests C, H, M, P (new letters).  
- T is in position 3 (allowed).  
- U is in position 4 (allowed, since it was in 3 before).  
- P is new, M is new, H is new.

This seems like a strong third guess.

Let’s list everything we now know after four guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, E, R, K, C, H, P, G, Y

Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown):  
T, U, N (each confirmed in the word, but none have been placed correctly yet)

Positions ruled out for each of those three letters:

- T cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from SLATE, GUNTY).  
  That leaves position 2 as the only possible place for T.

- U cannot be in positions 2, 3 (from TRUNK, GUNTY).  
  Remaining possible positions: 1, 4, 5.

- N cannot be in positions 3, 4 (from TRUNK, GUNTY).  
  Remaining possible positions: 1, 2, 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains T, U, N exactly once each,
- places T in position 2,
- places U and N in allowed positions,
- uses only letters not yet eliminated.

So far we have:
- T is fixed in position 2.
- U must be in 1, 4, or 5.
- N must be in 1, 2, or 5. But 2 is taken by T, so N must be in 1 or 5.

Let’s try to construct such a word.

Case 1: N in position 1  
Then U must be in 4 or 5.  
Word skeleton: N _ T _ _  
Need two more letters, not yet eliminated, and not T, U, N.  
Available letters: B, D, F, I, M, O, V, W, etc.

Example: N U T _ _ → but U cannot be in position 2 (already ruled out).  
N _ T U _ → possible: N I T U M  
Check: N I T U M  
- Letters: N, I, T, U, M – none are in the eliminated list.  
- T in 3? But we just established T must be in position 2.  
Oops, wrong.

Wait, T must be in position 2.  
So word skeleton: _ T _ _ _  
With N and U to place in positions 1, 3, 4, 5, obeying their rules.

Re-examine:

- T is fixed in position 2.  
- U must be in 1, 4, or 5.  
- N must be in 1, 5 (since 2 is T, 3 is allowed but we need to see).  
Wait, N cannot be in 3 or 4, so N must be in 1 or 5.

So possible word structures:

Structure 1: N T U _ _  
Structure 2: N T _ U _  
Structure 3: N T _ _ U  
Structure 4: _ T N U _  
Structure 5: _ T N _ U  
Structure 6: _ T _ N U  
Structure 7: _ T U N _  
Structure 8: _ T _ U N  
Structure 9: _ T N _ U  
Structure 10: _ T _ N U  

But U cannot be in position 2 (already ruled out), and N cannot be in 3 or 4.

Let’s try Structure 1: N T U _ _  
Need two more letters not yet eliminated.  
Available letters: B, D, F, I, M, O, V, W, etc.  
Example: N T U M I  
Check: N T U M I  
- Letters: N, T, U, M, I – none eliminated.  
- T in 2, U in 3 – but U cannot be in 3 (from CHUMP feedback).  
Invalid.

Structure 2: N T _ U _  
Need a letter for position 3.  
Example: N T I U M  
- N T I U M  
- T in 2, U in 4 – allowed.  
- N in 1 – allowed.  
- I and M new, not eliminated.  
This seems valid.

Another candidate: N T O U M  
Also valid.

Between these, N T I U M looks better.

Let’s verify:  
Letters: N, T, I, U, M  
- Eliminated list: S,L,A,E,R,K,C,H,P,G,Y – none used.  
- T in position 2 – allowed.  
- U in position 4 – allowed.  
- N in position 1 – allowed.  

This satisfies all constraints.

So the next guess is N T I U M.

Structure 2: N T _ U _  
Need a letter for position 3.  
Example: N T I U M  
- N T I U M  
- T in 2, U in 4 – allowed.  
- N in 1 – allowed.  
- I and M new, not eliminated.  
This seems valid.

Another candidate: N T O U M  
Also valid.

Between these, N T I U M looks better.

Let’s verify:  
Letters: N, T, I, U, M  
- Eliminated list: S,L,A,E,R,K,C,H,P,G,Y – none used.  
- T in position 2 – allowed.  
- U in position 4 – allowed.  
- N in position 1 – allowed.  

This satisfies all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting words in Wordle often include vowels and frequently used consonants. A good first guess is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- S, L, A, E are NOT in the word (x).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word contains the letter T somewhere other than the 4th position (since T was in position 4 in SLATE and marked “-”).  
The remaining letters we have not tested yet include:  
- Common consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc.  
- Vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are ruled out).

A good second guess should:
1. Re-use the letter T in a new position.
2. Introduce several new, common letters to test.

A strong candidate is “TRIUM” (but M is less common).  
“TRIOT” (but repeats T).  
“TRUNK” (tests R, U, N, K).  
“TRIPE” (but E is already ruled out).  
“TRIAD” (but A is ruled out).

Best choice: “TRUNK” – it places T in position 1, tests R, U, N, K, none of which have been ruled out yet.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: TRUNK -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(x) U(-) N(-) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(x)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E  
   – Letter T is in the word but NOT in position 4.

2. TRUNK → T(-) R(x) U(-) N(-) K(x)  
   – Letters NOT in the word: R, K  
   – Letter T is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   – Letters U and N are in the word but in wrong positions.

So we know:
- T is somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 4).  
- U and N are somewhere in the word, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.  
- Still-untested common letters: I, O, D, C, H, M, P, B, F, G, Y.

A good next guess should:
- Place T in a new position (e.g., position 3).  
- Re-test U and N in new positions.  
- Introduce several new, common letters.

Candidate word: “CHUMP”  
- Tests C, H, M, P (new letters).  
- T is in position 3 (allowed).  
- U is in position 4 (allowed, since it was in 3 before).  
- P is new, M is new, H is new.

This seems like a strong third guess.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

1. Letters NOT in the word (from all feedback):  
   S, L, A, E, R, K, C, H, P

2. Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown):  
   - T (cannot be in positions 1 or 4)  
   - U (cannot be in position 3)  
   - N (cannot be in position 4)  

3. Still-unused common letters that could help:  
   I, O, D, G, B, F, M, Y, W, V, etc.

We need a word that:
- Contains T, U, N (each in a new position).  
- Uses none of the eliminated letters.  
- Places T in position 2 or 3 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out).  
- Places U in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since 3 is ruled out).  
- Places N in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (since 4 is ruled out).  

A good candidate is “DUMPY”:
- D, M, Y are new letters.  
- T is in position 2 (allowed).  
- U is in position 3 → but position 3 is ruled out for U (from CHUMP feedback).  
Oops, invalid.

Next candidate: “BUILT”  
- B, I, L are new, but L is already eliminated.  
Invalid.

Candidate: “GUNTY”  
- G, Y are new.  
- T is in position 5 (allowed).  
- U is in position 2 (allowed).  
- N is in position 3 (allowed).  

This satisfies all constraints.

Let’s list everything we now know after four guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, E, R, K, C, H, P, G, Y

Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown):  
T, U, N (each confirmed in the word, but none have been placed correctly yet)

Positions ruled out for each of those three letters:

- T cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from SLATE, GUNTY).  
  That leaves position 2 as the only possible place for T.

- U cannot be in positions 2, 3 (from TRUNK, GUNTY).  
  Remaining possible positions: 1, 4, 5.

- N cannot be in positions 3, 4 (from TRUNK, GUNTY).  
  Remaining possible positions: 1, 2, 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains T, U, N exactly once each,
- places T in position 2,
- places U and N in allowed positions,
- uses only letters not yet eliminated.

So far we have:
- T is fixed in position 2.
- U must be in 1, 4, or 5.
- N must be in 1, 2, or 5. But 2 is taken by T, so N must be in 1 or 5.

Let’s try to construct such a word.

Case 1: N in position 1  
Then U must be in 4 or 5.  
Word skeleton: N _ T _ _  
Need two more letters, not yet eliminated, and not T, U, N.  
Available letters: B, D, F, I, M, O, V, W, etc.

Example: N U T _ _ → but U cannot be in position 2 (already ruled out).  
N _ T U _ → possible: N I T U M  
Check: N I T U M  
- Letters: N, I, T, U, M – none are in the eliminated list.  
- T in 3? But we just established T must be in position 2.  
Oops, wrong.

Wait, T must be in position 2.  
So word skeleton: _ T _ _ _  
With N and U to place in positions 1, 3, 4, 5, obeying their rules.

Re-examine:

- T is fixed in position 2.  
- U must be in 1, 4, or 5.  
- N must be in 1, 5 (since 2 is T, 3 is allowed but we need to see).  
Wait, N cannot be in 3 or 4, so N must be in 1 or 5.

So possible word structures:

Structure 1: N T U _ _  
Structure 2: N T _ U _  
Structure 3: N T _ _ U  
Structure 4: _ T N U _  
Structure 5: _ T N _ U  
Structure 6: _ T _ N U  
Structure 7: _ T U N _  
Structure 8: _ T _ U N  
Structure 9: _ T N _ U  
Structure 10: _ T _ N U  

But U cannot be in position 2 (already ruled out), and N cannot be in 3 or 4.

Let’s try Structure 1: N T U _ _  
Need two more letters not yet eliminated.  
Available letters: B, D, F, I, M, O, V, W, etc.  
Example: N T U M I  
Check: N T U M I  
- Letters: N, T, U, M, I – none eliminated.  
- T in 2, U in 3 – but U cannot be in 3 (from CHUMP feedback).  
Invalid.

Structure 2: N T _ U _  
Need a letter for position 3.  
Example: N T I U M  
- N T I U M  
- T in 2, U in 4 – allowed.  
- N in 1 – allowed.  
- I and M new, not eliminated.  
This seems valid.

Another candidate: N T O U M  
Also valid.

Between these, N T I U M looks better.

Let’s verify:  
Letters: N, T, I, U, M  
- Eliminated list: S,L,A,E,R,K,C,H,P,G,Y – none used.  
- T in position 2 – allowed.  
- U in position 4 – allowed.  
- N in position 1 – allowed.  

This satisfies all constraints.

So the next guess is N T I U M.
