For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word right away.

- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
1. The word contains R and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
2. The word does NOT contain A, O, or E.
3. We need a new 5-letter word that:
   - Includes R and S.

Possible vowels left: I, U
Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s try a word that places R and S in new positions and uses I or U as the vowel. A good candidate is ""FRISK"":
- F: new consonant
- R: moved to position 2 (was position 2 before, but since it was marked wrong position, this is still invalid)
Wait, in AROSE, R was in position 2 (A R O S E), so R can’t be in position 2 again. So FRISK is invalid for R.

Next candidate: ""CRISP""
- C: new consonant
- R: position 2 (invalid, same as before)

Next candidate: ""SPRIG""
- S: position 1 (was position 4 before, so this is fine)
- P: new consonant

From the two pieces of feedback we now have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
Guess 2: SPRIG → S(-) P(x) R(✓) I(-) G(x)

Key deductions so far:

1. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, O, E, P, G.
2. Letters definitely IN the word: R, S, I.
3. Positional constraints:
   - R is in the correct position (✓) in SPRIG, so R is in position 3.
   - S was marked “in word, wrong position” in both guesses:
     – In AROSE, S was in position 4 → must NOT be in position 4.
     – In SPRIG, S was in position 1 → must NOT be in position 1.
   - I was marked “in word, wrong position” in SPRIG (position 4) → must NOT be in position 4.

So the word looks like: _ _ R _ _  
We know it contains S and I, but:
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- I cannot be in position 4.

Possible positions for S: 2 or 5.  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, or 5.

Let’s try to place S in position 2 and I in position 5:
Word pattern: _ S R _ I

We need a consonant for position 1 and a consonant for position 4.  
Allowed consonants so far (not excluded): B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A common consonant pair for these slots is “B” and “T” (or similar).  
Trying “B” in position 1 and “T” in position 4 gives: B S R T I → “BSRTI” – not a valid English word.

Trying “C” in position 1 and “T” in position 4 gives: C S R T I – also invalid.

Trying “D” in position 1 and “T” in position 4: D S R T I – invalid.

Trying “F” in position 1 and “T” in position 4: F S R T I – invalid.

Trying “L” in position 1 and “T” in position 4: L S R T I – invalid.

Trying “M” in position 1 and “T” in position 4: M S R T I – invalid.

Trying “N” in position 1 and “T” in position 4: N S R T I – invalid.

Trying “S” in position 1 and “T” in position 4: S S R T I – invalid (double S).

Trying “T” in position 1 and “S” in position 4: T S R S I – invalid (double S).

Trying “T” in position 1 and “T” in position 4: T S R T I – invalid.

Let’s try placing S in position 5 and I in position 2:
Word pattern: _ I R _ S

Possible consonants for positions 1 and 4:  
We need a valid English word.  
Common choices: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, N, T, etc.

Trying “B” in position 1 and “T” in position 4: B I R T S → “BIRTH” – but H is excluded? No, H hasn’t been excluded yet.  
Wait, H hasn’t appeared in any guess, so it’s still possible.

“BIRTH” is a valid English word and fits all constraints:
- B: new consonant
- I: position 2 (was position 4 in SPRIG, so this is fine)
- R: position 3 (✓ from SPRIG)
- T: new consonant
- H: new consonant

Let’s verify:
- Contains R (position 3 ✓)
- Contains S (position 5, which wasn’t position 4 or 1 before, so fine)
- Contains I (position 2, wasn’t position 4 before, so fine)
- Excludes A, O, E, P, G (all correct)
- All letters are valid.

Therefore, “BIRTH” is a strong next guess.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word right away.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word contains R and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
2. The word does NOT contain A, O, or E.
3. We need a new 5-letter word that:
   - Includes R and S.
   - Excludes A, O, E.
   - Has R not in position 2 and S not in position 4.

Possible vowels left: I, U
Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s try a word that places R and S in new positions and uses I or U as the vowel. A good candidate is ""FRISK"":
- F: new consonant
- R: moved to position 2 (was position 2 before, but since it was marked wrong position, this is still invalid)
Wait, in AROSE, R was in position 2 (A R O S E), so R can’t be in position 2 again. So FRISK is invalid for R.

Next candidate: ""CRISP""
- C: new consonant
- R: position 2 (invalid, same as before)

Next candidate: ""SPRIG""
- S: position 1 (was position 4 before, so this is fine)
- P: new consonant
- R: position 3 (was position 2 before, so this is fine)
- I: new vowel
- G: new consonant

This seems valid.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SPRIG -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) R(✓) I(-) G(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback we now have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
Guess 2: SPRIG → S(-) P(x) R(✓) I(-) G(x)

Key deductions so far:

1. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, O, E, P, G.
2. Letters definitely IN the word: R, S, I.
3. Positional constraints:
   - R is in the correct position (✓) in SPRIG, so R is in position 3.
   - S was marked “in word, wrong position” in both guesses:
     – In AROSE, S was in position 4 → must NOT be in position 4.
     – In SPRIG, S was in position 1 → must NOT be in position 1.
   - I was marked “in word, wrong position” in SPRIG (position 4) → must NOT be in position 4.

So the word looks like: _ _ R _ _  
We know it contains S and I, but:
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- I cannot be in position 4.

Possible positions for S: 2 or 5.  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, or 5.

Let’s try to place S in position 2 and I in position 5:
Word pattern: _ S R _ I

We need a consonant for position 1 and a consonant for position 4.  
Allowed consonants so far (not excluded): B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A common consonant pair for these slots is “B” and “T” (or similar).  
Trying “B” in position 1 and “T” in position 4 gives: B S R T I → “BSRTI” – not a valid English word.

Trying “C” in position 1 and “T” in position 4 gives: C S R T I – also invalid.

Trying “D” in position 1 and “T” in position 4: D S R T I – invalid.

Trying “F” in position 1 and “T” in position 4: F S R T I – invalid.

Trying “L” in position 1 and “T” in position 4: L S R T I – invalid.

Trying “M” in position 1 and “T” in position 4: M S R T I – invalid.

Trying “N” in position 1 and “T” in position 4: N S R T I – invalid.

Trying “S” in position 1 and “T” in position 4: S S R T I – invalid (double S).

Trying “T” in position 1 and “S” in position 4: T S R S I – invalid (double S).

Trying “T” in position 1 and “T” in position 4: T S R T I – invalid.

Let’s try placing S in position 5 and I in position 2:
Word pattern: _ I R _ S

Possible consonants for positions 1 and 4:  
We need a valid English word.  
Common choices: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, N, T, etc.

Trying “B” in position 1 and “T” in position 4: B I R T S → “BIRTH” – but H is excluded? No, H hasn’t been excluded yet.  
Wait, H hasn’t appeared in any guess, so it’s still possible.

“BIRTH” is a valid English word and fits all constraints:
- B: new consonant
- I: position 2 (was position 4 in SPRIG, so this is fine)
- R: position 3 (✓ from SPRIG)
- T: new consonant
- H: new consonant

Let’s verify:
- Contains R (position 3 ✓)
- Contains S (position 5, which wasn’t position 4 or 1 before, so fine)
- Contains I (position 2, wasn’t position 4 before, so fine)
- Excludes A, O, E, P, G (all correct)
- All letters are valid.

Therefore, “BIRTH” is a strong next guess.

From the new feedback on BIRTH:

Key deductions:
1. B, T, H are not in the word.
2. I is in the correct position (position 2).
3. R is in the correct position (position 3).

So the word structure is now:
_ I R _ _

We already know:
- Must contain S (from earlier feedback: S was in word but wrong positions).
- Must contain S, and S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from earlier constraints).
- Possible positions for S: 5 (only remaining slot).

Thus S must be in position 5.

Word pattern: _ I R _ S

Remaining slots: 1 and 4.
Allowed consonants (not yet excluded): C, D, F, J, K, L, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid English word fitting _ I R _ S.

Common combinations:
- C I R C S → invalid
- D I R C S → invalid
- F I R C S → invalid
- L I R C S → invalid
- M I R C S → invalid
- N I R C S → invalid
- V I R C S → invalid
- W I R C S → invalid

Looking for actual words:
- ""FIRMS"" – but M is allowed, but S is already fixed at position 5. This would be F I R M S – but M is in position 4, which is allowed. However, we need to check if any letters are excluded. M hasn't been excluded, so this is possible.

But let's think of more common words:
- ""FIRNS"" – but N is allowed.
- ""DIRKS"" – K is allowed.
- ""FIRKS"" – K is allowed.
- ""DIRKS"" seems plausible.

But let's check ""DIRKS"":
D, I, R, K, S
- D: not excluded
- I: correct position
- R: correct position
- K: not excluded
- S: must be in position 5, which it is.

""DIRKS"" is a valid English word (plural of dirk, a dagger).

Another candidate: ""FIRNS"" – but F, I, R, N, S – N is allowed.

But ""DIRKS"" seems more likely.

Wait, let's check ""FIRNS"" – is that a word? Actually, ""FIRNS"" is not standard; ""FIRNS"" is the plural of ""firn"", which is a type of glacial ice. But it's less common.

""DIRKS"" is more common.

Another candidate: ""FIRMS"" – F, I, R, M, S – M is allowed.

Between ""DIRKS"" and ""FIRMS"", ""FIRMS"" is more common.

But let's verify:
- F: not excluded
- I: correct position
- R: correct position
- M: not excluded
- S: correct position

""FIRMS"" fits perfectly.

Therefore, ""FIRMS"" is the best next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants.

A common consonant pair for these slots is “B” and “T” (or similar).  
Trying “B” in position 1 and “T” in position 4 gives: B S R T I → “BSRTI” – not a valid English word.

Remaining slots: 1 and 4.
Allowed consonants (not yet excluded): C, D, F, J, K, L, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid English word fitting _ I R _ S.

Common combinations:
- C I R C S → invalid
- D I R C S → invalid
- F I R C S → invalid
- L I R C S → invalid
- M I R C S → invalid
- N I R C S → invalid
- V I R C S → invalid
- W I R C S → invalid

Looking for actual words:
- ""FIRMS"" – but M is allowed, but S is already fixed at position 5. This would be F I R M S – but M is in position 4, which is allowed. However, we need to check if any letters are excluded. M hasn't been excluded, so this is possible.

But let's think of more common words:
- ""FIRNS"" – but N is allowed.
- ""DIRKS"" – K is allowed.
- ""FIRKS"" – K is allowed.
- ""DIRKS"" seems plausible.

But let's check ""DIRKS"":
D, I, R, K, S
- D: not excluded
- I: correct position
- R: correct position
- K: not excluded
- S: must be in position 5, which it is.

""DIRKS"" is a valid English word (plural of dirk, a dagger).

Another candidate: ""FIRNS"" – but F, I, R, N, S – N is allowed.

But ""DIRKS"" seems more likely.

Wait, let's check ""FIRNS"" – is that a word? Actually, ""FIRNS"" is not standard; ""FIRNS"" is the plural of ""firn"", which is a type of glacial ice. But it's less common.

""DIRKS"" is more common.

Another candidate: ""FIRMS"" – F, I, R, M, S – M is allowed.

Between ""DIRKS"" and ""FIRMS"", ""FIRMS"" is more common.

But let's verify:
- F: not excluded
- I: correct position
- R: correct position
- M: not excluded
- S: correct position

""FIRMS"" fits perfectly.

Therefore, ""FIRMS"" is the best next guess.

From the latest feedback on FIRMS:

Key deductions:
1. F is not in the word.
2. I is in the correct position (position 2).
3. R is in the correct position (position 3).
4. M is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4, so it must be in position 1 or 5).
5. S is in the correct position (position 5).

So the word structure is now:
_ I R _ S

and M must be in position 1 or 4.

But position 5 is already S, so M must be in position 1 or 4. However, position 4 is the only remaining slot for M since position 1 is still open.

Wait, let's re-examine:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: I (✓)
- Position 3: R (✓)
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: S (✓)

M is in the word but not in position 4 (from feedback M(-) in position 4). Therefore, M must be in position 1.

Thus the word is:
M I R _ S

The only remaining consonant for position 4 must be a letter not yet excluded. Allowed consonants (not excluded): C, D, J, K, L, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for a valid 5-letter word: M I R _ S.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word right away.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- O: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
1. The word contains R and S, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.
2. The word does NOT contain A, O, or E.
3. We need a new 5-letter word that:
   - Includes R and S.
   - Excludes A, O, E.
   - Has R not in position 2 and S not in position 4.

Possible vowels left: I, U
Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s try a word that places R and S in new positions and uses I or U as the vowel. A good candidate is ""FRISK"":
- F: new consonant
- R: moved to position 2 (was position 2 before, but since it was marked wrong position, this is still invalid)
Wait, in AROSE, R was in position 2 (A R O S E), so R can’t be in position 2 again. So FRISK is invalid for R.

Next candidate: ""CRISP""
- C: new consonant
- R: position 2 (invalid, same as before)

Next candidate: ""SPRIG""
- S: position 1 (was position 4 before, so this is fine)
- P: new consonant

From the two pieces of feedback we now have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
Guess 2: SPRIG → S(-) P(x) R(✓) I(-) G(x)

Key deductions so far:

1. Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, O, E, P, G.
2. Letters definitely IN the word: R, S, I.
3. Positional constraints:
   - R is in the correct position (✓) in SPRIG, so R is in position 3.
   - S was marked “in word, wrong position” in both guesses:
     – In AROSE, S was in position 4 → must NOT be in position 4.
     – In SPRIG, S was in position 1 → must NOT be in position 1.
   - I was marked “in word, wrong position” in SPRIG (position 4) → must NOT be in position 4.

So the word looks like: _ _ R _ _  
We know it contains S and I, but:
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
- I cannot be in position 4.

Possible positions for S: 2 or 5.  
Possible positions for I: 1, 2, or 5.

Let’s try to place S in position 2 and I in position 5:
Word pattern: _ S R _ I

We need a consonant for position 1 and a consonant for position 4.  
Allowed consonants so far (not excluded): B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A common consonant pair for these slots is “B” and “T” (or similar).  
Trying “B” in position 1 and “T” in position 4 gives: B S R T I → “BSRTI” – not a valid English word.

Trying “C” in position 1 and “T” in position 4 gives: C S R T I – also invalid.

Trying “D” in position 1 and “T” in position 4: D S R T I – invalid.

Trying “F” in position 1 and “T” in position 4: F S R T I – invalid.

Trying “L” in position 1 and “T” in position 4: L S R T I – invalid.

Trying “M” in position 1 and “T” in position 4: M S R T I – invalid.

Trying “N” in position 1 and “T” in position 4: N S R T I – invalid.

Trying “S” in position 1 and “T” in position 4: S S R T I – invalid (double S).

Trying “T” in position 1 and “S” in position 4: T S R S I – invalid (double S).

Trying “T” in position 1 and “T” in position 4: T S R T I – invalid.

Let’s try placing S in position 5 and I in position 2:
Word pattern: _ I R _ S

Possible consonants for positions 1 and 4:  
We need a valid English word.  
Common choices: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, N, T, etc.

Trying “B” in position 1 and “T” in position 4: B I R T S → “BIRTH” – but H is excluded? No, H hasn’t been excluded yet.  
Wait, H hasn’t appeared in any guess, so it’s still possible.

“BIRTH” is a valid English word and fits all constraints:
- B: new consonant
- I: position 2 (was position 4 in SPRIG, so this is fine)
- R: position 3 (✓ from SPRIG)
- T: new consonant
- H: new consonant

Let’s verify:
- Contains R (position 3 ✓)
- Contains S (position 5, which wasn’t position 4 or 1 before, so fine)
- Contains I (position 2, wasn’t position 4 before, so fine)
- Excludes A, O, E, P, G (all correct)
- All letters are valid.

Therefore, “BIRTH” is a strong next guess.

Key deductions:
1. B, T, H are not in the word.
2. I is in the correct position (position 2).
3. R is in the correct position (position 3).

So the word structure is now:
_ I R _ _

We already know:
- Must contain S (from earlier feedback: S was in word but wrong positions).
- Must contain S, and S cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (from earlier constraints).
- Possible positions for S: 5 (only remaining slot).

Thus S must be in position 5.

Word pattern: _ I R _ S

Remaining slots: 1 and 4.
Allowed consonants (not yet excluded): C, D, F, J, K, L, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid English word fitting _ I R _ S.

Common combinations:
- C I R C S → invalid
- D I R C S → invalid
- F I R C S → invalid
- L I R C S → invalid
- M I R C S → invalid
- N I R C S → invalid
- V I R C S → invalid
- W I R C S → invalid

Looking for actual words:
- ""FIRMS"" – but M is allowed, but S is already fixed at position 5. This would be F I R M S – but M is in position 4, which is allowed. However, we need to check if any letters are excluded. M hasn't been excluded, so this is possible.

But let's think of more common words:
- ""FIRNS"" – but N is allowed.
- ""DIRKS"" – K is allowed.
- ""FIRKS"" – K is allowed.
- ""DIRKS"" seems plausible.

But let's check ""DIRKS"":
D, I, R, K, S
- D: not excluded
- I: correct position
- R: correct position
- K: not excluded
- S: must be in position 5, which it is.

""DIRKS"" is a valid English word (plural of dirk, a dagger).

Another candidate: ""FIRNS"" – but F, I, R, N, S – N is allowed.

But ""DIRKS"" seems more likely.

Wait, let's check ""FIRNS"" – is that a word? Actually, ""FIRNS"" is not standard; ""FIRNS"" is the plural of ""firn"", which is a type of glacial ice. But it's less common.

""DIRKS"" is more common.

Another candidate: ""FIRMS"" – F, I, R, M, S – M is allowed.

Between ""DIRKS"" and ""FIRMS"", ""FIRMS"" is more common.

But let's verify:
- F: not excluded

- R: correct position
- M: not excluded
- S: correct position

""FIRMS"" fits perfectly.

Therefore, ""FIRMS"" is the best next guess.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SPRIG -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) R(✓) I(-) G(x)
Guess 3: BIRTH -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(✓) R(✓) T(x) H(x)
Guess 4: FIRMS -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) R(✓) M(-) S(✓)

From the latest feedback on FIRMS:

F(x) I(✓) R(✓) M(-) S(✓)

Key deductions:
1. F is not in the word.
2. I is in the correct position (position 2).
3. R is in the correct position (position 3).
4. M is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 4, so it must be in position 1 or 5).
5. S is in the correct position (position 5).

So the word structure is now:
_ I R _ S

and M must be in position 1 or 4.

But position 5 is already S, so M must be in position 1 or 4. However, position 4 is the only remaining slot for M since position 1 is still open.

Wait, let's re-examine:
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: I (✓)
- Position 3: R (✓)
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: S (✓)

M is in the word but not in position 4 (from feedback M(-) in position 4). Therefore, M must be in position 1.

Thus the word is:
M I R _ S

The only remaining consonant for position 4 must be a letter not yet excluded. Allowed consonants (not excluded): C, D, J, K, L, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for a valid 5-letter word: M I R _ S.

Possible words:
- MIRKS – but K is allowed.
- MIRNS – N is allowed.
- MIRKS is the more common word.

Check MIRKS:
- M: position 1 (allowed)
- I: position 2 (✓)
- R: position 3 (✓)
- K: allowed
- S: position 5 (✓)

MIRKS fits all constraints.

From the latest feedback on MIRKS:

- Position 2: I (✓)  
- Position 3: R (✓)  
- Position 4: K (x) – so K is NOT in the word.

Therefore the word must be M I R _ S with the only missing letter in position 4.  
Letters already ruled out: A, O, E, P, G, B, T, H, F, K.  
Remaining consonants for position 4: C, D, J, L, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The only common English word that fits M I R _ S is MIRCS, MIRDS, MIRLS, MIRNS, MIRYS, etc.  
Among these, MIRNS is a valid plural of ""mirn"" (a variant spelling of ""myn"" or ""min""), but the more likely intended word is MIRCS (not common) or MIRDS (not a word).  
However, the most plausible and common word is MIRNS.

But let's double-check: MIRNS is valid in Scrabble dictionaries, though rare.  
Another candidate: MIRLS – not a word.  
MIRDS – not a word.  
MIRCS – not a word.  
MIRYS – not a word.  

Wait, let's think differently. The only remaining consonant that forms a valid word with MIR_S is MIRCS, MIRDS, MIRLS, MIRNS, etc.  
Actually, the correct word is MIRCS? No.  

Upon reflection, the only valid word fitting M I R _ S is MIRCS (not common) or MIRDS (not common).  
But let's check the dictionary: ""MIRNS"" is listed in some dictionaries as a plural of ""mirn"".  

However, there's another possibility: the word might be ""MIRCS"" – but that's not a word.  

Wait, let me reconsider. The feedback shows K is not in position 4, but the word must be M I R _ S.  
Looking at common words: ""MIRKS"" was already tried, and K is out.  
The next possible word is ""MIRCS"" – but that's not a word.
