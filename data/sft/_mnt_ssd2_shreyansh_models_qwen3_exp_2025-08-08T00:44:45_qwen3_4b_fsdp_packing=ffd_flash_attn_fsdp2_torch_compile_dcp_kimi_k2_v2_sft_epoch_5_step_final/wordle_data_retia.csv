### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain from the feedback. Common starting words include:
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and provides good coverage across different positions.

- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So we know:
1. Letters to include: R, A, E
2. Letters to exclude: C, N
3. Positions to avoid for R, A, E: R≠2, A≠3, E≠5

We need a new 5-letter word that contains R, A, E in different positions and avoids C and N. Let's try to place R, A, E in new spots while adding two new consonants.

Possible positions:
- R could be 1, 3, 4, or 5
- A could be 1, 2, 4, or 5
- E could be 1, 2, 3, or 4

Try ""EARLY"":

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain from the feedback. Common starting words include:
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and provides good coverage across different positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So we know:
1. Letters to include: R, A, E
2. Letters to exclude: C, N
3. Positions to avoid for R, A, E: R≠2, A≠3, E≠5

We need a new 5-letter word that contains R, A, E in different positions and avoids C and N. Let's try to place R, A, E in new spots while adding two new consonants.

Possible positions:
- R could be 1, 3, 4, or 5
- A could be 1, 2, 4, or 5
- E could be 1, 2, 3, or 4

Let's try ""RAISE"":
- R is in position 1 (new)
- A is in position 2 (new)
- I is a new consonant
- S is a new consonant
- E is in position 5 (but we know E is not in position 5 from feedback) → invalid

Try ""EARLY"":
- E is in position 1 (new)
- A is in position 2 (new)
- R is in position 3 (new)
- L is a new consonant
- Y is a new consonant
This seems valid.

But let's check another: ""TREAD"":
- T is new
- R is in position 2 (but R cannot be in position 2) → invalid

""GRAPE"":
- G is new
- R is in position 2 (invalid) → no

""REACT"":
- R is in position 1 (new)
- E is in position 2 (new)
- A is in position 3 (invalid, A cannot be in 3) → no

""EARLY"" seems best so far. Let's verify:
- Contains R, A, E
- No C or N
- R is in 3 (allowed)
- A is in 2 (allowed)
- E is in 1 (allowed)

This looks good.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word: R, A, E  
Letters that are NOT in the word: C, N, L, Y  

Positions ruled out so far:
- R ≠ 2 (from CRANE)

- A ≠ 3 (from CRANE)  
- A ≠ 2 (from EARLY)  
- E ≠ 5 (from CRANE)

So the remaining possible positions for each of R, A, E are:
- R: 1, 4, 5  
- A: 1, 4, 5  
- E: 2, 3, 4  

We still need two more consonants (since the word has only R, A, E confirmed).  
Good consonants to try next that haven’t been ruled out: S, T, D, B, M, etc.

Let’s pick a word that:
1. Uses R, A, E in still-allowed positions.
2. Adds two new consonants that haven’t been used yet.
3. Has a valid 5-letter structure.

One candidate is “STARE”:
- S is new.
- T is new.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- R is in position 4 (allowed).
- E is in position 5 (but E cannot be in position 5 from CRANE feedback) → invalid.

Another candidate: “TREAD”:

- R is in position 2 (invalid) → no.

Candidate: “BREAD”:

Candidate: “RATIO”:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- T and O are new.
- I is new.
- O is new.
This uses R, A, E? No, missing E → invalid.

Candidate: “EARLY” already tried, invalid.

Candidate: “REACT”:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- A is in position 3 (invalid) → no.

Candidate: “REBID”:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- B is new.
- I is new.
- D is new.
This uses R, E, but not A → invalid.

Candidate: “RAISE”:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- I is new.
- S is new.
- E is in position 5 (invalid) → no.

Candidate: “RAZED”:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- Z is new.
- E is in position 4 (allowed).

- R is in position 2 (invalid) → no.

Candidate: “DREAD”:
- D is new.
- R is in position 2 (invalid) → no.

Candidate: “PEACH”:

Candidate: “RATIO”:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- T and O are new.
- I is new.
- O is new.
This uses R, A, E? No, missing E → invalid.

Candidate: “EARLY” already tried, invalid.

Candidate: “REACT”:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- A is in position 3 (invalid) → no.

Candidate: “REBID”:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- B is new.
- I is new.
- D is new.
This uses R, E, but not A → invalid.

Candidate: “RAISE”:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- I is new.
- S is new.
- E is in position 5 (invalid) → no.

Candidate: “RAZED”:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- Z is new.
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- D is new.
This uses R, A, E and two new consonants (Z, D). All positions are allowed.

So “RAZED” seems valid.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

Confirmed letters in the word: R, A, E  
Confirmed positions:  
- R is in position 1 (from RAZED feedback)  
Confirmed letters NOT in the word: C, N, L, Y, Z, D  

Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in positions 2, 3 (from EARLY and CRANE feedback)  
- E cannot be in positions 1, 5 (from EARLY and CRANE feedback)  

So far we have:
R _ _ _ _  (R fixed in position 1)
and we still need to place A and E somewhere in the remaining 4 positions, plus two more consonants that haven’t been ruled out (avoiding C, N, L, Y, Z, D).

Possible remaining positions for A and E:
- A can be in positions 4 or 5  
- E can be in positions 2, 3, 4  

We need two new consonants. Good choices among unused consonants: S, T, B, M, F, G, H, K, etc.

Let’s try to form a valid word that satisfies:
- R _ _ _ _
- Contains A and E in allowed positions
- Adds two new consonants

Candidate: “RAISE”
- R is in position 1 (✓)
- A is in position 2 (invalid, A cannot be in 2) → no

Candidate: “REACT”
- R is in position 1 (✓)
- E is in position 2 (allowed)
- A is in position 3 (invalid, A cannot be in 3) → no

Candidate: “REBID”
- R is in position 1 (✓)
- E is in position 2 (allowed)
- B and I are new consonants
- D is already ruled out → no

Candidate: “REBUT”
- R is in position 1 (✓)
- E is in position 2 (allowed)
- B and T are new consonants
- U is new vowel
This uses R, E, and adds B, T, U. It doesn’t use A, but we know A must be in the word. So invalid.

Candidate: “RAISE” already invalid.

Candidate: “RAVINE” – too long.

Candidate: “RABID” – doesn’t use E.

Candidate: “RATIO” – doesn’t use A.

Candidate: “REBID” already considered.

Candidate: “REBUT” – missing A.

Candidate: “REBAN” – N is ruled out.

Candidate: “REBAG” – G is new, but A in 3 is invalid.

Candidate: “REBAY” – Y is ruled out.

Candidate: “REBAR”
- R is in position 1 (✓)
- E is in position 2 (allowed)
- B is new
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- R is repeated – acceptable
This uses R, E, A and adds B.

This seems valid.

From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word: R, E, A

Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in positions 3, 4 (from CRANE, EARLY, REBAR feedback)
- R cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5 (from CRANE, EARLY, REBAR feedback) – but position 1 is already confirmed, so R is only in position 1.

So the pattern is:
R E _ _ _

We still need two more consonants (since the word has only R, E, A confirmed, and we need two more letters). The remaining positions are 3 and 4, and the consonants must be chosen from the unused set: S, T, F, G, H, K, M, P, etc.

We also know:
- A must be in position 3 or 4 (since it cannot be in 2, 3, 4 are the only remaining for A? Wait, let's re-examine A's allowed positions.

From previous feedback:
- A is not in positions 2, 3 (from EARLY and CRANE)
- From REBAR: A is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
So A can only be in position 5.

Therefore the word must be:
R E _ _ A

Now we need two consonants for positions 3 and 4. Good choices from unused consonants: S, T, F, G, H, K, M, P.

Possible combinations:
- R E S T A
- R E S P A
- R E G A L (but L is ruled out)
- R E F T A
- R E S K A
- R E M A P (but P is allowed)

""RESTA"" is a valid 5-letter word (short for ""rest area""), but let's check if it uses allowed letters:
- R, E, S, T, A – all allowed.

Another candidate: ""RESPA"" (short for ""response area"") – but ""RESPA"" is not a common word.

""RESTA"" seems the best.

But let's check another: ""REACT"" – but C is ruled out.

""REACT"" invalid.

""REBID"" invalid (B ruled out).

""REBUT"" invalid (B ruled out).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize information gain from the feedback. Common starting words include:
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and provides good coverage across different positions.

From the feedback on CRANE:

- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- N is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So we know:
1. Letters to include: R, A, E
2. Letters to exclude: C, N
3. Positions to avoid for R, A, E: R≠2, A≠3, E≠5

We need a new 5-letter word that contains R, A, E in different positions and avoids C and N. Let's try to place R, A, E in new spots while adding two new consonants.

Possible positions:
- R could be 1, 3, 4, or 5
- A could be 1, 2, 4, or 5
- E could be 1, 2, 3, or 4

Let's try ""RAISE"":
- R is in position 1 (new)
- A is in position 2 (new)
- I is a new consonant
- S is a new consonant
- E is in position 5 (but we know E is not in position 5 from feedback) → invalid

Try ""EARLY"":
- E is in position 1 (new)
- A is in position 2 (new)
- R is in position 3 (new)
- L is a new consonant
- Y is a new consonant
This seems valid.

But let's check another: ""TREAD"":
- T is new
- R is in position 2 (but R cannot be in position 2) → invalid

""GRAPE"":
- G is new
- R is in position 2 (invalid) → no

""REACT"":
- R is in position 1 (new)
- E is in position 2 (new)
- A is in position 3 (invalid, A cannot be in 3) → no

""EARLY"" seems best so far. Let's verify:
- Contains R, A, E
- No C or N
- R is in 3 (allowed)
- A is in 2 (allowed)
- E is in 1 (allowed)

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word: R, A, E  
Letters that are NOT in the word: C, N, L, Y  

Positions ruled out so far:
- R ≠ 2 (from CRANE)

- A ≠ 3 (from CRANE)  
- A ≠ 2 (from EARLY)  
- E ≠ 5 (from CRANE)

So the remaining possible positions for each of R, A, E are:
- R: 1, 4, 5  
- A: 1, 4, 5  
- E: 2, 3, 4  

We still need two more consonants (since the word has only R, A, E confirmed).  
Good consonants to try next that haven’t been ruled out: S, T, D, B, M, etc.

Candidate: “RATIO”:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- T and O are new.
- I is new.
- O is new.
This uses R, A, E? No, missing E → invalid.

Candidate: “EARLY” already tried, invalid.

Candidate: “REACT”:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- A is in position 3 (invalid) → no.

Candidate: “REBID”:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- B is new.
- I is new.
- D is new.
This uses R, E, but not A → invalid.

Candidate: “RAISE”:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- I is new.
- S is new.
- E is in position 5 (invalid) → no.

Candidate: “RAZED”:
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- Z is new.
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- D is new.
This uses R, A, E and two new consonants (Z, D). All positions are allowed.

So “RAZED” seems valid.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

Confirmed letters in the word: R, A, E  
Confirmed positions:  
- R is in position 1 (from RAZED feedback)  
Confirmed letters NOT in the word: C, N, L, Y, Z, D  

Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in positions 2, 3 (from EARLY and CRANE feedback)  
- E cannot be in positions 1, 5 (from EARLY and CRANE feedback)  

So far we have:
R _ _ _ _  (R fixed in position 1)
and we still need to place A and E somewhere in the remaining 4 positions, plus two more consonants that haven’t been ruled out (avoiding C, N, L, Y, Z, D).

Possible remaining positions for A and E:
- A can be in positions 4 or 5  
- E can be in positions 2, 3, 4  

We need two new consonants. Good choices among unused consonants: S, T, B, M, F, G, H, K, etc.

Let’s try to form a valid word that satisfies:
- R _ _ _ _
- Contains A and E in allowed positions
- Adds two new consonants

Candidate: “RAISE”
- R is in position 1 (✓)
- A is in position 2 (invalid, A cannot be in 2) → no

Candidate: “REACT”
- R is in position 1 (✓)
- E is in position 2 (allowed)
- A is in position 3 (invalid, A cannot be in 3) → no

Candidate: “REBID”
- R is in position 1 (✓)
- E is in position 2 (allowed)
- B and I are new consonants
- D is already ruled out → no

Candidate: “REBUT”
- R is in position 1 (✓)
- E is in position 2 (allowed)
- B and T are new consonants
- U is new vowel
This uses R, E, and adds B, T, U. It doesn’t use A, but we know A must be in the word. So invalid.

Candidate: “RAISE” already invalid.

Candidate: “RAVINE” – too long.

Candidate: “RABID” – doesn’t use E.

Candidate: “RATIO” – doesn’t use A.

Candidate: “REBID” already considered.

Candidate: “REBUT” – missing A.

Candidate: “REBAN” – N is ruled out.

Candidate: “REBAG” – G is new, but A in 3 is invalid.

Candidate: “REBAY” – Y is ruled out.

Candidate: “REBAR”
- R is in position 1 (✓)
- E is in position 2 (allowed)
- B is new
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- R is repeated – acceptable
This uses R, E, A and adds B.

This seems valid.

From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the word: R, E, A  
Letters that are NOT in the word: C, N, L, Y, Z, D, B  

Confirmed positions:
- R is in position 1 (✓)
- E is in position 2 (✓)

Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in positions 3, 4 (from CRANE, EARLY, REBAR feedback)
- R cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5 (from CRANE, EARLY, REBAR feedback) – but position 1 is already confirmed, so R is only in position 1.

So the pattern is:
R E _ _ _

We still need two more consonants (since the word has only R, E, A confirmed, and we need two more letters). The remaining positions are 3 and 4, and the consonants must be chosen from the unused set: S, T, F, G, H, K, M, P, etc.

We also know:
- A must be in position 3 or 4 (since it cannot be in 2, 3, 4 are the only remaining for A? Wait, let's re-examine A's allowed positions.

From previous feedback:
- A is not in positions 2, 3 (from EARLY and CRANE)
- From REBAR: A is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
So A can only be in position 5.

Therefore the word must be:
R E _ _ A

Now we need two consonants for positions 3 and 4. Good choices from unused consonants: S, T, F, G, H, K, M, P.

Possible combinations:
- R E S T A
- R E S P A
- R E G A L (but L is ruled out)
- R E F T A
- R E S K A
- R E M A P (but P is allowed)

""RESTA"" is a valid 5-letter word (short for ""rest area""), but let's check if it uses allowed letters:
- R, E, S, T, A – all allowed.

Another candidate: ""RESPA"" (short for ""response area"") – but ""RESPA"" is not a common word.

""RESTA"" seems the best.

But let's check another: ""REACT"" – but C is ruled out.

""REACT"" invalid.

""REBID"" invalid (B ruled out).

""REBUT"" invalid (B ruled out).

""REBAR"" already tried.

""REBID"" invalid.

""REBUT"" invalid.

""RESTA"" is valid.

Another candidate: ""RESPA"" – but not common.

""REACT"" invalid.

""REBID"" invalid.

""REBUT"" invalid.

""RESTA"" is the only valid word fitting the pattern R E _ _ A with allowed letters.

Thus, the next guess is ""RESTA"".
