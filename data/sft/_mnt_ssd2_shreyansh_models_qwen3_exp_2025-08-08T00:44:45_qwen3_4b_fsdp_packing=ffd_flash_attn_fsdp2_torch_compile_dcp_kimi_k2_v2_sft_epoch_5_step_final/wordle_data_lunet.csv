1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives me the best chance to get information about multiple letters at once.

From the feedback:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1-4.

I now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses none of A, R, O, S.
2. Contains E in one of the first four positions.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, U (since A, O are out).

A word that fits: ""UNTIE""  
- Uses U, N, T, I, E (none of the excluded letters).
- E is in position 5, but we know E is NOT in position 5. So this is invalid.

Next option: ""ELITE""  
- E is in position 1 (valid, since E is allowed in positions 1-4).
- Uses L, I, T, E (none of the excluded letters).

This seems like a good next guess.

Let’s consolidate everything we know after three guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (x-feedback):
A, R, O, S, I

Letters that ARE in the word (– feedback):
E, L, T, U, N

Positions ruled out so far:

E: not positions 1, 2, 5
L: not positions 2, 4
T: not positions 3, 4
U: not position 1
N: not position 2

So the word must contain each of E, L, T, U, N exactly once (since each has only received one “–” so far).

We need a permutation of the letters {E, L, T, U, N} that satisfies:
- E in 3rd or 4th position
- L in 1st, 3rd, or 5th position
- T in 1st, 2nd, or 5th position
- U in 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th position
- N in 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th position

Let’s list valid permutations:

1. E must be in 3 or 4
   - If E is in 3: positions 1,2,4,5 must be L,T,U,N
   - If E is in 4: positions 1,2,3,5 must be L,T,U,N

Try E in 3rd position:
Positions: _ _ E _ _
Need L, T, U, N in 1,2,4,5 with constraints:
- L not in 2 or 4 → L must be 1 or 5
- T not in 3 or 4 → T can be 1,2,5
- U not in 1 → U can be 2,4,5
- N not in 2 → N can be 1,3,4,5 but 3 is E, so 1,4,5

Let’s try L in 1st:
1: L
Then T must be in 2 or 5
U must be in 2,4,5
N must be in 4 or 5

Case L1 T2: then U must be 4 or 5, N must be 4 or 5 but not same as T2
   - T2 U4 N5 → word L T E U N
   - Check constraints:
      L1 ok (not 2,4)
      T2 ok (not 3,4)
      U4 ok (not 1)
      N5 ok (not 2)
   This seems valid: L T E U N

Let’s verify: L T E U N
- Letters: L, T, E, U, N – all required
- E in 3rd (ok)
- L in 1st (ok)
- T in 2nd (ok)
- U in 4th (ok)
- N in 5th (ok)

This looks correct.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives me the best chance to get information about multiple letters at once.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1-4.

I now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses none of A, R, O, S.
2. Contains E in one of the first four positions.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, U (since A, O are out).

A word that fits: ""UNTIE""  
- Uses U, N, T, I, E (none of the excluded letters).
- E is in position 5, but we know E is NOT in position 5. So this is invalid.

Next option: ""ELITE""  
- E is in position 1 (valid, since E is allowed in positions 1-4).
- Uses L, I, T, E (none of the excluded letters).

This seems like a good next guess.

Guess 2: ELITE -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) I(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>

Let's digest the new feedback from Guess 2 (ELITE):

E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
L(-) – L is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
I(x) – I is NOT in the word.  
T(-) – T is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, I.  
- Letters that ARE in the word: E, L, T.  
- E cannot be in positions 1 or 5.  
- L cannot be in position 2.  
- T cannot be in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E, L, T exactly once each (since they each got one “-” feedback).  
- Uses none of A, R, O, S, I.  
- Places E in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
- Places L in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
- Places T in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Common remaining consonants: N, D, C, M, P, B, etc.  
Good vowel left: U (since A, O, I are out).

Let’s try a word that uses E, L, T plus two new letters, keeping positions in mind.  
Candidate: “UNTLE”  
- U, N, T, L, E.  
- Contains all required letters.  
- E is in position 4 (allowed).  
- L is in position 4 (allowed).  
- T is in position 3 (allowed).  

This seems valid.

Positions ruled out so far:

E: not positions 1, 2, 5
L: not positions 2, 4
T: not positions 3, 4
U: not position 1
N: not position 2

So the word must contain each of E, L, T, U, N exactly once (since each has only received one “–” so far).

We need a permutation of the letters {E, L, T, U, N} that satisfies:

- T in 1st, 2nd, or 5th position
- U in 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th position

Let’s list valid permutations:

1. E must be in 3 or 4
   - If E is in 3: positions 1,2,4,5 must be L,T,U,N
   - If E is in 4: positions 1,2,3,5 must be L,T,U,N

Positions: _ _ E _ _

- L not in 2 or 4 → L must be 1 or 5
- T not in 3 or 4 → T can be 1,2,5
- U not in 1 → U can be 2,4,5
- N not in 2 → N can be 1,3,4,5 but 3 is E, so 1,4,5

Let’s try L in 1st:
1: L
Then T must be in 2 or 5
U must be in 2,4,5
N must be in 4 or 5

Case L1 T2: then U must be 4 or 5, N must be 4 or 5 but not same as T2
   - T2 U4 N5 → word L T E U N
   - Check constraints:
      L1 ok (not 2,4)
      T2 ok (not 3,4)
      U4 ok (not 1)
      N5 ok (not 2)
   This seems valid: L T E U N

Let’s verify: L T E U N
- Letters: L, T, E, U, N – all required
- E in 3rd (ok)
- L in 1st (ok)
- T in 2nd (ok)
- U in 4th (ok)

From Guess 4 (LTEUN) we now know:

L(✓) – L is in the word AND in the correct position 1.

T(-) – T is in the word but NOT in position 2.
E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 3.
U(-) – U is in the word but NOT in position 4.
N(-) – N is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the pattern so far is:
1: L (fixed)
2: must be one of the remaining letters (T, E, U, N) but T is not allowed here (because T(-) says T is not in position 2), and positions for others are still open.
3: must be one of the remaining letters, but E is not allowed here (because E(-) says E is not in position 3).
4: must be one of the remaining letters, but U is not allowed here (because U(-) says U is not in position 4).
5: must be one of the remaining letters, but N is not allowed here (because N(-) says N is not in position 5).

Letters still required: T, E, U, N (each must appear exactly once).

So the word is L _ _ _ _ with the remaining four letters T, E, U, N in positions 2-5, satisfying:
- T not in 2
- E not in 3
- U not in 4
- N not in 5

Let's list all permutations of T, E, U, N in positions 2-5 and filter:

Possible permutations:
1. T E U N → positions 2-5: T, E, U, N
   - T in 2 → invalid (T not allowed in 2)
2. T U E N → positions 2-5: T, U, E, N
   - T in 2 → invalid
3. T U N E → positions 2-5: T, U, N, E
   - T in 2 → invalid
4. E T U N → positions 2-5: E, T, U, N
   - E in 2 → ok
   - T in 3 → ok (T not restricted from 3)
   - U in 4 → invalid (U not allowed in 4)
5. E U T N → positions 2-5: E, U, T, N
   - E in 2 → ok
   - U in 3 → ok
   - T in 4 → ok (T not restricted from 4)
   - N in 5 → invalid (N not allowed in 5)
6. E U N T → positions 2-5: E, U, N, T
   - E in 2 → ok
   - U in 3 → ok
   - N in 4 → ok (N not restricted from 4)
   - T in 5 → ok (T not restricted from 5)
   This permutation satisfies all constraints: E in 2, U in 3, N in 4, T in 5.

So the word must be L E U N T.

<guess>LEUNT</guess>",LEUNT,"From Guess 4 (LTEUN) we now know:

L(✓) – L is in the word AND in the correct position 1.

T(-) – T is in the word but NOT in position 2.
E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 3.
U(-) – U is in the word but NOT in position 4.
N(-) – N is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the pattern so far is:
1: L (fixed)
2: must be one of the remaining letters (T, E, U, N) but T is not allowed here (because T(-) says T is not in position 2), and positions for others are still open.
3: must be one of the remaining letters, but E is not allowed here (because E(-) says E is not in position 3).
4: must be one of the remaining letters, but U is not allowed here (because U(-) says U is not in position 4).
5: must be one of the remaining letters, but N is not allowed here (because N(-) says N is not in position 5).

Letters still required: T, E, U, N (each must appear exactly once).

So the word is L _ _ _ _ with the remaining four letters T, E, U, N in positions 2-5, satisfying:
- T not in 2
- E not in 3
- U not in 4
- N not in 5

Let's list all permutations of T, E, U, N in positions 2-5 and filter:

Possible permutations:
1. T E U N → positions 2-5: T, E, U, N
   - T in 2 → invalid (T not allowed in 2)
2. T U E N → positions 2-5: T, U, E, N
   - T in 2 → invalid
3. T U N E → positions 2-5: T, U, N, E
   - T in 2 → invalid
4. E T U N → positions 2-5: E, T, U, N
   - E in 2 → ok
   - T in 3 → ok (T not restricted from 3)
   - U in 4 → invalid (U not allowed in 4)
5. E U T N → positions 2-5: E, U, T, N
   - E in 2 → ok
   - U in 3 → ok
   - T in 4 → ok (T not restricted from 4)
   - N in 5 → invalid (N not allowed in 5)
6. E U N T → positions 2-5: E, U, N, T
   - E in 2 → ok
   - U in 3 → ok
   - N in 4 → ok (N not restricted from 4)
   - T in 5 → ok (T not restricted from 5)
   This permutation satisfies all constraints: E in 2, U in 3, N in 4, T in 5.

So the word must be L E U N T.

Let's verify:
- L is in position 1 (✓)
- E is in position 2 (allowed, since E(-) only ruled out 1 and 3)
- U is in position 3 (allowed, since U(-) only ruled out 4)
- N is in position 4 (allowed, since N(-) only ruled out 5)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a starting guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives me the best chance to get information about multiple letters at once.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1-4.

I now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses none of A, R, O, S.
2. Contains E in one of the first four positions.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, U (since A, O are out).

A word that fits: ""UNTIE""  
- Uses U, N, T, I, E (none of the excluded letters).
- E is in position 5, but we know E is NOT in position 5. So this is invalid.

Next option: ""ELITE""  
- E is in position 1 (valid, since E is allowed in positions 1-4).
- Uses L, I, T, E (none of the excluded letters).

This seems like a good next guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ELITE -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) I(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's digest the new feedback from Guess 2 (ELITE):

E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
L(-) – L is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
I(x) – I is NOT in the word.  
T(-) – T is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, I.  
- Letters that ARE in the word: E, L, T.  
- E cannot be in positions 1 or 5.  
- L cannot be in position 2.  
- T cannot be in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E, L, T exactly once each (since they each got one “-” feedback).  
- Uses none of A, R, O, S, I.  
- Places E in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
- Places L in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
- Places T in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Common remaining consonants: N, D, C, M, P, B, etc.  
Good vowel left: U (since A, O, I are out).

Let’s try a word that uses E, L, T plus two new letters, keeping positions in mind.  
Candidate: “UNTLE”  
- U, N, T, L, E.  
- Contains all required letters.  
- E is in position 4 (allowed).  
- L is in position 4 (allowed).  
- T is in position 3 (allowed).  

This seems valid.

Let’s consolidate everything we know after three guesses.

Letters NOT in the word (x-feedback):
A, R, O, S, I

Letters that ARE in the word (– feedback):
E, L, T, U, N

Positions ruled out so far:

E: not positions 1, 2, 5
L: not positions 2, 4
T: not positions 3, 4
U: not position 1
N: not position 2

So the word must contain each of E, L, T, U, N exactly once (since each has only received one “–” so far).

We need a permutation of the letters {E, L, T, U, N} that satisfies:
- E in 3rd or 4th position
- L in 1st, 3rd, or 5th position
- T in 1st, 2nd, or 5th position
- U in 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th position
- N in 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th position

Let’s list valid permutations:

1. E must be in 3 or 4
   - If E is in 3: positions 1,2,4,5 must be L,T,U,N
   - If E is in 4: positions 1,2,3,5 must be L,T,U,N

Try E in 3rd position:
Positions: _ _ E _ _
Need L, T, U, N in 1,2,4,5 with constraints:
- L not in 2 or 4 → L must be 1 or 5
- T not in 3 or 4 → T can be 1,2,5
- U not in 1 → U can be 2,4,5
- N not in 2 → N can be 1,3,4,5 but 3 is E, so 1,4,5

Let’s try L in 1st:
1: L
Then T must be in 2 or 5
U must be in 2,4,5
N must be in 4 or 5

Case L1 T2: then U must be 4 or 5, N must be 4 or 5 but not same as T2
   - T2 U4 N5 → word L T E U N
   - Check constraints:
      L1 ok (not 2,4)
      T2 ok (not 3,4)
      U4 ok (not 1)
      N5 ok (not 2)
   This seems valid: L T E U N

Let’s verify: L T E U N
- Letters: L, T, E, U, N – all required
- E in 3rd (ok)
- L in 1st (ok)
- T in 2nd (ok)
- U in 4th (ok)
- N in 5th (ok)

This looks correct.

From Guess 4 (LTEUN) we now know:

L(✓) – L is in the word AND in the correct position 1.

T(-) – T is in the word but NOT in position 2.
E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 3.
U(-) – U is in the word but NOT in position 4.
N(-) – N is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the pattern so far is:
1: L (fixed)
2: must be one of the remaining letters (T, E, U, N) but T is not allowed here (because T(-) says T is not in position 2), and positions for others are still open.
3: must be one of the remaining letters, but E is not allowed here (because E(-) says E is not in position 3).
4: must be one of the remaining letters, but U is not allowed here (because U(-) says U is not in position 4).
5: must be one of the remaining letters, but N is not allowed here (because N(-) says N is not in position 5).

Letters still required: T, E, U, N (each must appear exactly once).

So the word is L _ _ _ _ with the remaining four letters T, E, U, N in positions 2-5, satisfying:
- T not in 2
- E not in 3
- U not in 4
- N not in 5

Let's list all permutations of T, E, U, N in positions 2-5 and filter:

Possible permutations:
1. T E U N → positions 2-5: T, E, U, N
   - T in 2 → invalid (T not allowed in 2)
2. T U E N → positions 2-5: T, U, E, N
   - T in 2 → invalid
3. T U N E → positions 2-5: T, U, N, E
   - T in 2 → invalid
4. E T U N → positions 2-5: E, T, U, N
   - E in 2 → ok
   - T in 3 → ok (T not restricted from 3)
   - U in 4 → invalid (U not allowed in 4)
5. E U T N → positions 2-5: E, U, T, N
   - E in 2 → ok
   - U in 3 → ok
   - T in 4 → ok (T not restricted from 4)
   - N in 5 → invalid (N not allowed in 5)
6. E U N T → positions 2-5: E, U, N, T
   - E in 2 → ok
   - U in 3 → ok
   - N in 4 → ok (N not restricted from 4)
   - T in 5 → ok (T not restricted from 5)
   This permutation satisfies all constraints: E in 2, U in 3, N in 4, T in 5.

So the word must be L E U N T.

Let's verify:
- L is in position 1 (✓)
- E is in position 2 (allowed, since E(-) only ruled out 1 and 3)
- U is in position 3 (allowed, since U(-) only ruled out 4)
- N is in position 4 (allowed, since N(-) only ruled out 5)
- T is in position 5 (allowed, since T(-) only ruled out 2 and 4)

- N(-) – N is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
- T(✓) – T is correct in position 5.

So the pattern is now:  
L _ _ _ T

Letters still required: E, U, N (each must appear exactly once).

Positions left: 2, 3, 4.

Constraints:
- E cannot be in position 2 or 3 (from E(-) and E(-) in earlier guesses).  
  Therefore E must be in position 4.  
- U cannot be in position 3 (from U(-)).  
- N cannot be in position 4 (from N(-)).

But position 4 must be E, so N cannot be in position 4 anyway.  
That leaves positions 2 and 3 for U and N, with U not allowed in position 3.  
Hence:
- Position 2: U or N  
- Position 3: the other (N or U)  

Possible permutations:
1. U in 2, N in 3 → L U N E T  
2. N in 2, U in 3 → L N U E T  

Check constraints:
- E is in position 4 (allowed).  
- U in position 3 is invalid (from U(-)).  
- N in position 2 is allowed.  

Thus the only valid word is L U N E T.

Let's verify:
- L(✓) in 1, T(✓) in 5.  
- E in 4 (allowed).  
- U in 2 (allowed, only ruled out in 3).  
- N in 3 (allowed, only ruled out in 4).
