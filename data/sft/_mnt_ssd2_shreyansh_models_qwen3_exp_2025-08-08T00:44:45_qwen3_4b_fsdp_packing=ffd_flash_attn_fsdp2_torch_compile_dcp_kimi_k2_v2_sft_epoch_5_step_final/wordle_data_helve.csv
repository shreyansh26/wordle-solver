1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the feedback will help me narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.

I want to test a mix of consonants and vowels. A good candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- Ends with E.
- Contains U, N, T, I (none of which are forbidden).
- Tests four new letters (U, N, T, I).

Another option is ""WHITE"", but it uses H and I, which are both valid. However, ""UNTIE"" uses more distinct letters, giving more information.

I'll go with ""UNTIE"".

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y.

Possible candidates:
- ""BLEVE"" – uses B, L, V (all allowed), ends in E.
- ""CHEESE"" – too long.
- ""FLEET"" – uses F, L, E, T (but T is eliminated).
- ""GIMME"" – uses G, I, M (but I is eliminated).
- ""WHELP"" – doesn’t end in E.
- ""HOMIE"" – uses H, O, M (but O is eliminated).
- ""MELVE"" – uses M, E, L, V (all allowed), ends in E.

""MELVE"" seems like a strong candidate because it tests three new letters (M, L, V) while maintaining the known ending E. It’s also a valid English word (though less common, it’s recognized in some dictionaries).

Another quick check: ""WHELP"" is invalid (doesn’t end in E), ""FLEET"" is invalid (T), ""GIMME"" invalid (I). ""BLEVE"" is valid but uses B and V. ""MELVE"" uses M, L, V – all allowed.

- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, M  
- Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not listed).

We need a 5-letter word that fits _ _ L V E and uses only allowed letters for the first two positions.

Possible first letters (from allowed set): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z  
Possible second letters: same set.

Scanning common words:
- BLEVE – already tried (MELVE)  
- CLIVE – C, L, I, V, E → I is forbidden.  
- DOLVE – not a valid word.  
- FLIVE – not a valid word.  
- GLIVE – not a valid word.  
- HOLVE – not a valid word.  
- KOLVE – not a valid word.  
- PLOVE – not a valid word.  
- WOLVE – not a valid word.  
- YOLVE – not a valid word.  

Wait, let’s check “BLEVE” again: it was MELVE, not BLEVE.  
We need to find a word that fits _ _ L V E with allowed letters in positions 1 and 2.

Another candidate: “BLEVE” – but we already saw it’s invalid because we’d have to use M, which is forbidden.  
Actually, “BLEVE” is valid (a variant of “bleve” meaning a rupture), but it’s obscure.

A more common word: “CLEVE” – but C, L, E, V, E → C is allowed, L is correct, V is correct, E is correct, but we need to check if C is allowed. C hasn’t been eliminated, so “CLEVE” is possible.

Let me verify:
- C: not eliminated → ok  
- L: correct position (3)  
- E: correct position (5)  
- V: correct position (4)  

So “CLEVE” fits the pattern _ _ L V E and uses only allowed letters.

Another check: “GLEVE” – G is allowed, L, V, E are correct.  
“GLEVE” is also valid (a type of geological structure).

Between “CLEVE” and “GLEVE”, both are valid. I’ll choose “GLEVE” because G is a common starting consonant and hasn’t been tested yet.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the feedback will help me narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (last letter).
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Does not contain A, R, O, or S.

Common letters left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I want to test a mix of consonants and vowels. A good candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- Ends with E.
- Contains U, N, T, I (none of which are forbidden).
- Tests four new letters (U, N, T, I).

Another option is ""WHITE"", but it uses H and I, which are both valid. However, ""UNTIE"" uses more distinct letters, giving more information.

I'll go with ""UNTIE"".

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

- The word ends in E (position 5).
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, using none of the eliminated letters.

Possible candidates:
- ""BLEVE"" – uses B, L, V (all allowed), ends in E.
- ""CHEESE"" – too long.
- ""FLEET"" – uses F, L, E, T (but T is eliminated).
- ""GIMME"" – uses G, I, M (but I is eliminated).
- ""WHELP"" – doesn’t end in E.
- ""HOMIE"" – uses H, O, M (but O is eliminated).
- ""MELVE"" – uses M, E, L, V (all allowed), ends in E.

""MELVE"" seems like a strong candidate because it tests three new letters (M, L, V) while maintaining the known ending E. It’s also a valid English word (though less common, it’s recognized in some dictionaries).

Another quick check: ""WHELP"" is invalid (doesn’t end in E), ""FLEET"" is invalid (T), ""GIMME"" invalid (I). ""BLEVE"" is valid but uses B and V. ""MELVE"" uses M, L, V – all allowed.

So I’ll go with ""MELVE"".

From the new feedback on GLEVE:
- G is NOT in the word (x).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- V is in the correct position (✓).  
- E is in the correct position (✓).

So we now know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ V E (positions 4 and 5 are fixed as V and E).
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, M, G.
- Letters that ARE in the word: L and V (but L is NOT in position 3, and E is NOT in position 2).

Therefore:
- L must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since position 5 is already E and position 2 was marked wrong for E in GLEVE).

Forbidden letters for positions 1-3: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, M, G.

Allowed letters for positions 1-3: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z, plus L and E (since L and E are confirmed in the word).

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ _ _ V E that uses L and E in positions 1-3, with no forbidden letters.

Possible words:
- BLEVE – already tried (MELVE) but B is allowed. However, in MELVE the L was in position 3 and got marked as correct, but in GLEVE the L was in position 2 and got marked as wrong. So L must be in position 1 or 3. BLEVE has L in position 2, which is wrong, so BLEVE is invalid.
- CLEVE – C is allowed, but in CLEVE the L is in position 2, which is wrong (from GLEVE feedback), so CLEVE is invalid.
- FLEVE – F is allowed, but L is in position 2, which is wrong.
- HOLVE – H is allowed, but O is forbidden.
- JOLVE – J is allowed, but O is forbidden.
- KOLVE – K is allowed, but O is forbidden.
- PLOVE – P is allowed, but O is forbidden.
- WOLVE – W is allowed, but O is forbidden.
- YOLVE – Y is allowed, but O is forbidden.

Looking for words where L is in position 1 or 3:
- L _ _ V E: Possible words: LEVE? – but LEVE is 4 letters. LEVE_ – no common words.
- _ _ L V E: We already tried MELVE and GLEVE. In GLEVE, L was in position 3 and got marked as correct, but in GLEVE the L was in position 2. Wait, no: in GLEVE the L was in position 2 and got marked as wrong. So L must be in position 1 or 3.

Looking at _ _ L V E:
- BLIVE – B, L, I, V, E – I is forbidden.
- CLIVE – C, L, I, V, E – I is forbidden.
- DLIVE – D, L, I, V, E – I is forbidden.
- FLIVE – F, L, I, V, E – I is forbidden.
- GLIVE – G is forbidden.
- HLIVE – H, L, I, V, E – I is forbidden.
- KLIVE – K, L, I, V, E – I is forbidden.
- PLIVE – P, L, I, V, E – I is forbidden.
- WLIVE – W, L, I, V, E – I is forbidden.

So none of the _ _ L V E words work because they all contain I.

Looking at L _ _ V E:
- L _ _ V E: Possible words: L E V E – but that’s 4 letters. LEVE_ – no common words.

Hmm, this suggests we need to re-examine. The feedback from GLEVE says:
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In GLEVE, L was in position 2, so L must be in position 1 or 3.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In GLEVE, E was in position 3, so E must be in position 1 or 2.

So the word must contain L and E in positions 1-3, with no duplicates (since positions 4-5 are V and E).

Possible combinations:
- L E _ V E – but E is already in position 5, so E cannot be in position 2.
- L _ E V E – E is in position 3, which was marked wrong for E in GLEVE (E was in position 3 and got (-)), so E cannot be in position 3.
- _ E L V E – E is in position 2, which was marked wrong for E in GLEVE (E was in position 3 and got (-)), so this is possible.
- _ L E V E – E is in position 3, which was marked wrong for E in GLEVE, so this is not possible.

Thus the only possible pattern is _ E L V E, but this would have E in position 2 and L in position 3, which was the case in GLEVE (L in 2, E in 3), but in GLEVE L was in position 2 and got (-), so L must be in position 1 or 3. Similarly, E must be in position 1 or 2.

Wait, let's list all constraints again:
- Pattern: _ _ _ V E
- L must be in position 1 or 3 (since it was in position 2 in GLEVE and got (-))
- E must be in position 1 or 2 (since it was in position 3 in GLEVE and got (-))

Possible positions:
1. L in position 1, E in position 1: impossible (same position)
2. L in position 1, E in position 2: L E _ V E
3. L in position 3, E in position 1: E _ L V E
4. L in position 3, E in position 2: _ E L V E

Check each:
2. L E _ V E: Need a letter for position 3. Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z. Possible word: L E B V E – but ""LEBVE"" is not a word. L E C V E – ""LECVE"" not a word. L E D V E – ""LEDVE"" not a word. L E F V E – ""LEFVE"" not a word. L E H V E – ""LEHVE"" not a word. L E K V E – ""LEKVE"" not a word. L E P V E – ""LEPVE"" not a word.

3. E _ L V E: Need a letter for position 2. Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z. Possible word: E B L V E – ""EBLVE"" not a word. E C L V E – ""ECLVE"" not a word.

4. _ E L V E: Need a letter for position 1. Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z. Possible word: B E L V E – ""BELVE"" not a word. C E L V E – ""CELVE"" not a word.

Z E L V E – ""ZELVE"" not a word.

Thus the only valid word is ""DELVE"".

Check constraints:
- DELVE: D, E, L, V, E
- Pattern: _ _ _ V E – DELVE fits (D, E, L, V, E)
- L is in position 3 (was in position 2 in GLEVE and got (-), so position 3 is ok)
- E is in position 2 (was in position 3 in GLEVE and got (-), so position 2 is ok)
- No forbidden letters: D, E, L, V are all allowed.

Therefore, the next guess is DELVE.
</think>

<guess>DELVE</guess>",DELVE,"From the new feedback on GLEVE:
- G is NOT in the word (x).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- V is in the correct position (✓).  
- E is in the correct position (✓).

So we now know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ V E (positions 4 and 5 are fixed as V and E).
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, M, G.
- Letters that ARE in the word: L and V (but L is NOT in position 3, and E is NOT in position 2).

Therefore:
- L must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since position 5 is already E and position 2 was marked wrong for E in GLEVE).

Forbidden letters for positions 1-3: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, M, G.

Allowed letters for positions 1-3: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z, plus L and E (since L and E are confirmed in the word).

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ _ _ V E that uses L and E in positions 1-3, with no forbidden letters.

Possible words:
- BLEVE – already tried (MELVE) but B is allowed. However, in MELVE the L was in position 3 and got marked as correct, but in GLEVE the L was in position 2 and got marked as wrong. So L must be in position 1 or 3. BLEVE has L in position 2, which is wrong, so BLEVE is invalid.
- CLEVE – C is allowed, but in CLEVE the L is in position 2, which is wrong (from GLEVE feedback), so CLEVE is invalid.
- FLEVE – F is allowed, but L is in position 2, which is wrong.
- HOLVE – H is allowed, but O is forbidden.
- JOLVE – J is allowed, but O is forbidden.
- KOLVE – K is allowed, but O is forbidden.
- PLOVE – P is allowed, but O is forbidden.
- WOLVE – W is allowed, but O is forbidden.
- YOLVE – Y is allowed, but O is forbidden.

Looking for words where L is in position 1 or 3:

- CLIVE – C, L, I, V, E – I is forbidden.
- DLIVE – D, L, I, V, E – I is forbidden.
- FLIVE – F, L, I, V, E – I is forbidden.

- KLIVE – K, L, I, V, E – I is forbidden.
- PLIVE – P, L, I, V, E – I is forbidden.
- WLIVE – W, L, I, V, E – I is forbidden.

So none of the _ _ L V E words work because they all contain I.

Looking at L _ _ V E:
- L _ _ V E: Possible words: L E V E – but that’s 4 letters. LEVE_ – no common words.

Hmm, this suggests we need to re-examine. The feedback from GLEVE says:

Thus the only possible pattern is _ E L V E, but this would have E in position 2 and L in position 3, which was the case in GLEVE (L in 2, E in 3), but in GLEVE L was in position 2 and got (-), so L must be in position 1 or 3. Similarly, E must be in position 1 or 2.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, and the feedback will help me narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (last letter).
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Does not contain A, R, O, or S.

Common letters left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I want to test a mix of consonants and vowels. A good candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- Ends with E.
- Contains U, N, T, I (none of which are forbidden).
- Tests four new letters (U, N, T, I).

Another option is ""WHITE"", but it uses H and I, which are both valid. However, ""UNTIE"" uses more distinct letters, giving more information.

I'll go with ""UNTIE"".

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we know:

- The word ends in E (position 5).
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, using none of the eliminated letters.

Possible candidates:
- ""BLEVE"" – uses B, L, V (all allowed), ends in E.
- ""CHEESE"" – too long.
- ""FLEET"" – uses F, L, E, T (but T is eliminated).
- ""GIMME"" – uses G, I, M (but I is eliminated).
- ""WHELP"" – doesn’t end in E.
- ""HOMIE"" – uses H, O, M (but O is eliminated).
- ""MELVE"" – uses M, E, L, V (all allowed), ends in E.

""MELVE"" seems like a strong candidate because it tests three new letters (M, L, V) while maintaining the known ending E. It’s also a valid English word (though less common, it’s recognized in some dictionaries).

Another quick check: ""WHELP"" is invalid (doesn’t end in E), ""FLEET"" is invalid (T), ""GIMME"" invalid (I). ""BLEVE"" is valid but uses B and V. ""MELVE"" uses M, L, V – all allowed.

So I’ll go with ""MELVE"".

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ Word ends with E and does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(✓)

3. MELVE → M(x) E(✓) L(✓) V(✓) E(✓)  
   ⇒ Word ends with E and does NOT contain M.  
   ⇒ Letters L and V are in the word and are in the correct positions (positions 3 and 4).

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ L V E  
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, M  
- Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not listed).

We need a 5-letter word that fits _ _ L V E and uses only allowed letters for the first two positions.

Possible first letters (from allowed set): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z  
Possible second letters: same set.

Scanning common words:
- BLEVE – already tried (MELVE)  
- CLIVE – C, L, I, V, E → I is forbidden.  
- DOLVE – not a valid word.  
- FLIVE – not a valid word.  
- GLIVE – not a valid word.  
- HOLVE – not a valid word.  
- KOLVE – not a valid word.  
- PLOVE – not a valid word.  
- WOLVE – not a valid word.  
- YOLVE – not a valid word.  

Wait, let’s check “BLEVE” again: it was MELVE, not BLEVE.  
We need to find a word that fits _ _ L V E with allowed letters in positions 1 and 2.

Another candidate: “BLEVE” – but we already saw it’s invalid because we’d have to use M, which is forbidden.  
Actually, “BLEVE” is valid (a variant of “bleve” meaning a rupture), but it’s obscure.

A more common word: “CLEVE” – but C, L, E, V, E → C is allowed, L is correct, V is correct, E is correct, but we need to check if C is allowed. C hasn’t been eliminated, so “CLEVE” is possible.

Let me verify:
- C: not eliminated → ok  
- L: correct position (3)  
- E: correct position (5)  
- V: correct position (4)  

So “CLEVE” fits the pattern _ _ L V E and uses only allowed letters.

Another check: “GLEVE” – G is allowed, L, V, E are correct.  
“GLEVE” is also valid (a type of geological structure).

Between “CLEVE” and “GLEVE”, both are valid. I’ll choose “GLEVE” because G is a common starting consonant and hasn’t been tested yet.

From the new feedback on GLEVE:
- G is NOT in the word (x).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
- V is in the correct position (✓).  
- E is in the correct position (✓).

So we now know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ V E (positions 4 and 5 are fixed as V and E).
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, M, G.
- Letters that ARE in the word: L and V (but L is NOT in position 3, and E is NOT in position 2).

Therefore:
- L must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since position 5 is already E and position 2 was marked wrong for E in GLEVE).

Forbidden letters for positions 1-3: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, M, G.

Allowed letters for positions 1-3: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z, plus L and E (since L and E are confirmed in the word).

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ _ _ V E that uses L and E in positions 1-3, with no forbidden letters.

Possible words:
- BLEVE – already tried (MELVE) but B is allowed. However, in MELVE the L was in position 3 and got marked as correct, but in GLEVE the L was in position 2 and got marked as wrong. So L must be in position 1 or 3. BLEVE has L in position 2, which is wrong, so BLEVE is invalid.
- CLEVE – C is allowed, but in CLEVE the L is in position 2, which is wrong (from GLEVE feedback), so CLEVE is invalid.
- FLEVE – F is allowed, but L is in position 2, which is wrong.
- HOLVE – H is allowed, but O is forbidden.
- JOLVE – J is allowed, but O is forbidden.
- KOLVE – K is allowed, but O is forbidden.
- PLOVE – P is allowed, but O is forbidden.
- WOLVE – W is allowed, but O is forbidden.
- YOLVE – Y is allowed, but O is forbidden.

Looking for words where L is in position 1 or 3:
- L _ _ V E: Possible words: LEVE? – but LEVE is 4 letters. LEVE_ – no common words.
- _ _ L V E: We already tried MELVE and GLEVE. In GLEVE, L was in position 3 and got marked as correct, but in GLEVE the L was in position 2. Wait, no: in GLEVE the L was in position 2 and got marked as wrong. So L must be in position 1 or 3.

Looking at _ _ L V E:
- BLIVE – B, L, I, V, E – I is forbidden.
- CLIVE – C, L, I, V, E – I is forbidden.
- DLIVE – D, L, I, V, E – I is forbidden.
- FLIVE – F, L, I, V, E – I is forbidden.
- GLIVE – G is forbidden.
- HLIVE – H, L, I, V, E – I is forbidden.
- KLIVE – K, L, I, V, E – I is forbidden.
- PLIVE – P, L, I, V, E – I is forbidden.
- WLIVE – W, L, I, V, E – I is forbidden.

So none of the _ _ L V E words work because they all contain I.

Looking at L _ _ V E:
- L _ _ V E: Possible words: L E V E – but that’s 4 letters. LEVE_ – no common words.

Hmm, this suggests we need to re-examine. The feedback from GLEVE says:
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In GLEVE, L was in position 2, so L must be in position 1 or 3.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-). In GLEVE, E was in position 3, so E must be in position 1 or 2.

So the word must contain L and E in positions 1-3, with no duplicates (since positions 4-5 are V and E).

Possible combinations:
- L E _ V E – but E is already in position 5, so E cannot be in position 2.
- L _ E V E – E is in position 3, which was marked wrong for E in GLEVE (E was in position 3 and got (-)), so E cannot be in position 3.
- _ E L V E – E is in position 2, which was marked wrong for E in GLEVE (E was in position 3 and got (-)), so this is possible.
- _ L E V E – E is in position 3, which was marked wrong for E in GLEVE, so this is not possible.

Thus the only possible pattern is _ E L V E, but this would have E in position 2 and L in position 3, which was the case in GLEVE (L in 2, E in 3), but in GLEVE L was in position 2 and got (-), so L must be in position 1 or 3. Similarly, E must be in position 1 or 2.

Wait, let's list all constraints again:

- L must be in position 1 or 3 (since it was in position 2 in GLEVE and got (-))
- E must be in position 1 or 2 (since it was in position 3 in GLEVE and got (-))

Possible positions:
1. L in position 1, E in position 1: impossible (same position)

Check each:
2. L E _ V E: Need a letter for position 3. Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z. Possible word: L E B V E – but ""LEBVE"" is not a word. L E C V E – ""LECVE"" not a word. L E D V E – ""LEDVE"" not a word. L E F V E – ""LEFVE"" not a word. L E H V E – ""LEHVE"" not a word. L E K V E – ""LEKVE"" not a word. L E P V E – ""LEPVE"" not a word.

3. E _ L V E: Need a letter for position 2. Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z. Possible word: E B L V E – ""EBLVE"" not a word. E C L V E – ""ECLVE"" not a word. E D L V E – ""EDLVE"" not a word. E F L V E – ""EFLVE"" not a word. E H L V E – ""EHLVE"" not a word. E J L V E – ""EJLVE"" not a word. E K L V E – ""EKLVE"" not a word.

E Z L V E – ""EZLVE"" not a word. No common words here.

4. _ E L V E: Need a letter for position 1. Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z. Possible word: B E L V E – ""BELVE"" not a word. C E L V E – ""CELVE"" not a word. D E L V E – ""DELVE"" is a valid word (past tense of delve). F E L V E – ""FELVE"" not a word. H E L V E – ""HELVE"" not a word. J E L V E – ""JELVE"" not a word. K E L V E – ""KELVE"" not a word. P E L V E – ""PELVE"" not a word. Q E L V E – ""QELVE"" not a word. W E L V E – ""WELVE"" not a word. X E L V E – ""XELVE"" not a word. Y E L V E – ""YELVE"" not a word. Z E L V E – ""ZELVE"" not a word.

Thus the only valid word is ""DELVE"".

Check constraints:
- DELVE: D, E, L, V, E
- Pattern: _ _ _ V E – DELVE fits (D, E, L, V, E)
- L is in position 3 (was in position 2 in GLEVE and got (-), so position 3 is ok)
- E is in position 2 (was in position 3 in GLEVE and got (-), so position 2 is ok)
- No forbidden letters: D, E, L, V are all allowed.

Therefore, the next guess is DELVE.

However, ""HELVE"" is actually a valid word (a ridge or crest on a hill). Let me double-check:
- H is allowed (not in forbidden list).
- E, L, V, E are correctly placed.
- ""HELVE"" is recognized in some dictionaries.

Another possibility is ""WELVE"" but that’s not standard. ""HELVE"" seems the closest valid option.
