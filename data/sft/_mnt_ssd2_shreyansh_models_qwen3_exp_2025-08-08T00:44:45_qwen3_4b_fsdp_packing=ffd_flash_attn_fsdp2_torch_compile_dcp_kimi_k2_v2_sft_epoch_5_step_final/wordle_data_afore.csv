### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information I can get from the feedback. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:
- A: very common vowel
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: very common consonant
- E: most common letter in English

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, regardless of what the word actually is. I'll go with AROSE.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(✓) – A is correct in the first position.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in the second position.
- O(✓) – O is correct in the third position.
- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.
- E(✓) – E is correct in the fifth position.

So the pattern so far is:
A _ O _ E

Letters we know are in the word: A, O, E, R
Letters we know are NOT in the word: S

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A
- Has O in the 3rd position
- Has E in the 5th position
- Contains R somewhere (but not in the 2nd position)

Possible positions for R: 2nd, 4th, or 5th. But 5th is E, so R must be 2nd or 4th.

Looking at common words fitting A _ O _ E with R:
- A R O _ E → ARONE (not a valid word)
- A _ O R E → AFORE (valid word, but ""AFORE"" is archaic)
- A _ O _ E with R in 4th: A B O R E (ABORE – not a word)
- A _ O _ E with R in 2nd: A R O _ E – none valid

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe R is in the 4th position. Then the word would be A _ O R E. Possible letters for the 2nd position: common consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y.

Looking for valid words:
- A B O R E – ABOR E? No.
- A C O R E – ACORE? No.
- A D O R E – ADORE – yes, this is a valid word.

So ADORE fits:
A(✓) D(?) O(✓) R(-) E(✓)

This seems like a good next guess because it places R in the 4th position (which is allowed) and uses a common letter D in the 2nd position. This should give us information about D and whether R is indeed in the 4th position.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ Pattern so far: A _ O _ E, with R somewhere in the word (not 2nd), and S is out.

2. ADORE → A(✓) D(x) O(✓) R(✓) E(✓)  
   ⇒ This locks R into the 4th position.  
   ⇒ D is NOT in the word (D(x)).

So the confirmed pattern is: A _ O R E

Letters we know are in the word: A, O, R, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, D

We need a valid 5-letter English word that matches A _ O R E.

Common consonants for the 2nd position: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.

Looking at A _ O R E:

- AFORE – archaic, not common
- APORE – not a word
- ADORE – already tried
- ABORE – not a word
- ACORE – not a word
- AGORE – not a word
- AMORE – valid word (Italian loanword, but accepted in Scrabble/Wordle lists)
- ANORE – not a word
- APHOR – no
- ACHOR – no

The only valid word left that fits A _ O R E is AMORE.

Let’s check:
A M O R E – all letters fit the constraints, and M hasn’t been tested yet.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains:\n- A: very common vowel\n- R: common consonant\n- O: common vowel\n- S: very common consonant\n- E: most common letter in English\n\nThis combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, regardless of what the word actually is.

From the feedback so far:

- Pattern locked in: A _ O R E
- Letters known to be in the word: A, O, R, E
- Letters known NOT in the word: S, D, M

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with A, has O in the 3rd position, R in the 4th, and E in the 5th, with the 2nd letter being any consonant that hasn’t been ruled out.

So the structure is: A [? (not S, D, M)] O R E

Possible consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, L, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.

Let’s list valid English words that fit A _ O R E:

- AFORE – archaic (but sometimes accepted)
- APORE – not a word
- ACHOR – not a word
- AGORE – not a word
- ANORE – not a word
- ABORE – not a word
- ACORE – not a word
- ACHOR – no
- AFORE – the only common one left

Since AFORE is the only remaining valid word that fits the pattern and hasn’t been tried, we’ll guess it.
