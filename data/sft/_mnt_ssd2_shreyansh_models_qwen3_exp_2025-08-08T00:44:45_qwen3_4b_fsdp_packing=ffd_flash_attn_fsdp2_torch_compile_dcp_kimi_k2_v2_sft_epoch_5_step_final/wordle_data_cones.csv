Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (S, T, L), giving good coverage of frequent letters in 5-letter words.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but not in position 1.
- L is not in the word at all.
- A is not in the word at all.
- T is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: L, A, T
- Letters that must appear somewhere: S, E
- S cannot be in position 1.
- E cannot be in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and E.
2. Does not contain L, A, or T.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places E somewhere other than position 5.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, R, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible vowels left: I, O, U (since A is out and E is already in)

Let’s try a word that uses common remaining consonants and places S and E appropriately. A good candidate is “SHINE”:
- S in position 1 (but feedback said S is not in position 1, so this is invalid)
Next candidate: “SPICE”
- S in position 1 (invalid again)
Next candidate: “CRISP”
- C, R, I, P, S
- S is in position 5 (allowed)
- E is missing (invalid)
Next candidate: “SPERM”
- S in position 1 (invalid)
Next candidate: “SERUM”
- S in position 1 (invalid)
Next candidate: “SEWER”

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (S, T, L), giving good coverage of frequent letters in 5-letter words.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L, A, T are NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E, but S is not in position 1 and E is not in position 5.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S somewhere other than position 1.
- Has E somewhere other than position 5.
- Does not contain L, A, or T.

Good candidates: 
- SIREN (S in position 1 is invalid)
- SHINE (S in position 1 is invalid)
- SEREN (invalid, not a word)
- SWEET (S in position 1 is invalid)
- SHIRE (S in position 1 is invalid)
- SIREN (invalid)
- SIREN (invalid)
- SIREN (invalid)

Wait, let me think differently. Since S can't be first, and E can't be fifth, maybe:
- E is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- S is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Possible words:
- E S _ _ _
- _ E S _ _
- _ _ E S _
- _ _ _ E S

Looking at common words:
- E S C _ _ (ESC is not 5 letters)
- _ E S C _ (ESC is not 5 letters)
- _ _ E S _ (e.g., ""HEXES"" but has X)
- _ _ _ E S (e.g., ""WORSE"")

""WORSE"" seems valid:
- W O R S E
- S is in position 4 (not 1)
- E is in position 5 (but feedback says E is not in position 5) - so this is invalid.

""HEXES"":
- H E X E S
- E is in position 2 (valid)
- S is in position 5 (valid)
- Does not contain L, A, T
- Is a valid 5-letter word

This seems to fit all constraints.

  - H is not in the word.

  - The last E is in the word and is in position 5 (✓). 

Wait, the feedback shows two E's: the second E is marked ✓ (correct position) and the fourth E is marked (-) (present but wrong position). This is contradictory because the fourth letter of HEXES is E, and it is marked (-), meaning E is in the word but not in position 4. But the fifth letter is E and is marked ✓, meaning E is in position 5.

So the word must have:
- E in position 5 (✓ from HEXES fifth letter).
- S is in the word but not in position 1 (from SLATE).
- No L, A, T, H, X.

Therefore, the word ends with E and contains S somewhere in positions 2-5 (but not 1), and no L, A, T, H, X.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 4, or 5. But position 5 is already E, so S must be in 2, 3, or 4.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (S, T, L), giving good coverage of frequent letters in 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L, A, T are NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E, but S is not in position 1 and E is not in position 5.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S somewhere other than position 1.
- Has E somewhere other than position 5.
- Does not contain L, A, or T.

Good candidates: 
- SIREN (S in position 1 is invalid)
- SHINE (S in position 1 is invalid)
- SEREN (invalid, not a word)
- SWEET (S in position 1 is invalid)
- SHIRE (S in position 1 is invalid)
- SIREN (invalid)
- SIREN (invalid)
- SIREN (invalid)

Wait, let me think differently. Since S can't be first, and E can't be fifth, maybe:
- E is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- S is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Possible words:
- E S _ _ _
- _ E S _ _
- _ _ E S _
- _ _ _ E S

Looking at common words:
- E S C _ _ (ESC is not 5 letters)
- _ E S C _ (ESC is not 5 letters)
- _ _ E S _ (e.g., ""HEXES"" but has X)
- _ _ _ E S (e.g., ""WORSE"")

""WORSE"" seems valid:
- W O R S E
- S is in position 4 (not 1)
- E is in position 5 (but feedback says E is not in position 5) - so this is invalid.

""HEXES"":
- H E X E S
- E is in position 2 (valid)
- S is in position 5 (valid)
- Does not contain L, A, T
- Is a valid 5-letter word

This seems to fit all constraints.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 4, or 5. But position 5 is already E, so S must be in 2, 3, or 4.

Let’s consolidate everything we know after four guesses.

1. From SLATE:  
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.  
   - L, A, T are NOT in the word.

2. From HEXES:  
   - H, X are NOT in the word.

   - S is in position 5 (✓).

3. From PRIZE:  
   - P, R, I, Z are NOT in the word.  
   - E is in position 5 (✓).  

So the word must:
- End in E (position 5).  
- Have E in position 4 (from HEXES).  
- Contain S somewhere (but not position 1).  
- Exclude L, A, T, H, X, P, R, I, Z.

The only remaining letters we haven’t ruled out are: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E with an E in position 4 and an S somewhere in positions 2-4 (since position 5 is E).  
But position 4 is already E, so S must be in position 2 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- _ S E _ E  
- _ _ E S E  

Looking for valid English words:
- BRISE (but R, I are excluded)  
- CRISP (but ends in P)  
- DRIPS (but ends in S)  
- BRISK (but ends in K)  
- CRISP (but ends in P)

Possible words:
- BESSE (not a word)  
- CESSÉ (not a word)  
- DENSE (but N is allowed, S is in position 2, E in 4, ends in E)  
- MENSE (not a word)  
- WESSE (not a word)  

The only valid word fitting is DENSE.

Check DENSE:

- E in position 4 (✓)  
- S in position 3 (valid, not position 1)

   - S is in position 5 (✓).

3. From PRIZE:  
   - P, R, I, Z are NOT in the word.  
   - E is in position 5 (✓).  

So the word must:
- End in E (position 5).  
- Have E in position 4 (from HEXES).  
- Contain S somewhere (but not position 1).  
- Exclude L, A, T, H, X, P, R, I, Z.

The only remaining letters we haven’t ruled out are: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E with an E in position 4 and an S somewhere in positions 2-4 (since position 5 is E).  
But position 4 is already E, so S must be in position 2 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- _ S E _ E  
- _ _ E S E  

Looking for valid English words:
- BRISE (but R, I are excluded)  
- CRISP (but ends in P)  
- DRIPS (but ends in S)  
- BRISK (but ends in K)  
- CRISP (but ends in P)  
- PRISM (but ends in M)  
- DRIPS (but ends in S)  
- FRISK (but ends in K)  
- CRISP (but ends in P)  

Valid candidates:
- CRISP (invalid, ends in P)  
- DRIPS (invalid, ends in S)  
- BRISK (invalid, ends in K)  

Wait, let’s list all 5-letter words ending in E, with E in position 4, and S in position 2 or 3, using only allowed letters.

Possible words:
- BESSE (not a word)  
- CESSÉ (not a word)  
- DENSE (but N is allowed, S is in position 2, E in 4, ends in E)  
- MENSE (not a word)  
- WESSE (not a word)  

The only valid word fitting is DENSE.

Check DENSE:
- D N S E E  
- Ends in E (position 5 ✓)  
- E in position 4 (✓)  
- S in position 3 (valid, not position 1)  
- No excluded letters (L, A, T, H, X, P, R, I, Z).  

So the next guess is DENSE.",Guess 5: DENSE -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) N(✓) S(-) E(-),FAIL

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (S, T, L), giving good coverage of frequent letters in 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Model answer is not in the correct format
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- L, A, T are NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not fifth).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E, but S is not in position 1 and E is not in position 5.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S somewhere other than position 1.
- Has E somewhere other than position 5.
- Does not contain L, A, or T.

Good candidates: 
- SIREN (S in position 1 is invalid)
- SHINE (S in position 1 is invalid)
- SEREN (invalid, not a word)
- SWEET (S in position 1 is invalid)
- SHIRE (S in position 1 is invalid)
- SIREN (invalid)
- SIREN (invalid)
- SIREN (invalid)

Wait, let me think differently. Since S can't be first, and E can't be fifth, maybe:
- E is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- S is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Possible words:
- E S _ _ _
- _ E S _ _
- _ _ E S _
- _ _ _ E S

Looking at common words:
- E S C _ _ (ESC is not 5 letters)
- _ E S C _ (ESC is not 5 letters)
- _ _ E S _ (e.g., ""HEXES"" but has X)
- _ _ _ E S (e.g., ""WORSE"")

""WORSE"" seems valid:
- W O R S E
- S is in position 4 (not 1)
- E is in position 5 (but feedback says E is not in position 5) - so this is invalid.

""HEXES"":
- H E X E S
- E is in position 2 (valid)
- S is in position 5 (valid)
- Does not contain L, A, T
- Is a valid 5-letter word

This seems to fit all constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Model answer is not in the correct format
Guess 3: HEXES -> FEEDBACK: H(x) E(-) X(x) E(✓) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's digest the new feedback:

- From SLATE: S is in the word but not in position 1; E is in the word but not in position 5; L, A, T are not in the word.

- From HEXES: 
  - H is not in the word.
  - E is in the word and is in position 4 (✓).
  - X is not in the word.
  - The last E is in the word and is in position 5 (✓). 

Wait, the feedback shows two E's: the second E is marked ✓ (correct position) and the fourth E is marked (-) (present but wrong position). This is contradictory because the fourth letter of HEXES is E, and it is marked (-), meaning E is in the word but not in position 4. But the fifth letter is E and is marked ✓, meaning E is in position 5.

So the word must have:
- E in position 5 (✓ from HEXES fifth letter).
- S is in the word but not in position 1 (from SLATE).
- No L, A, T, H, X.

Therefore, the word ends with E and contains S somewhere in positions 2-5 (but not 1), and no L, A, T, H, X.

Possible positions for S: 2, 3, 4, or 5. But position 5 is already E, so S must be in 2, 3, or 4.

Let's think of 5-letter words ending in E, containing S, and avoiding L, A, T, H, X.

Possible words:
- BRISE (but has I, R)
- PRIZE (but has Z)
- CRISP (but has P, I)
- DRIPS (but has D, R, I, P, S)
- CRISP (but has P, I)
- BRISK (but has K)
- PRISM (but has M)
- CRISP (but has P, I)
- PRISM (but has M)
- DRIPS (but has D, R, I, P, S)
- FRISK (but has K)
- BRISK (but has K)

Wait, let's list valid words ending in E with S in positions 2-4 and no L, A, T, H, X.

Looking at common words:
- PRIZE (but Z is uncommon)
- CRISP (but ends in P)
- DRIPS (ends in S, not E)
- BRISK (ends in K)
- CRISP (ends in P)
- PRISM (ends in M)
- DRIPS (ends in S)
- PRIZE (ends in E, has Z)

PRIZE ends in E, contains S (position 2), no L, A, T, H, X.

Let's check:
- P R I Z E
- S is in position 2 (valid, since S can be in 2-4)
- Ends with E (position 5 ✓)
- No L, A, T, H, X

This seems valid.

Another option: CRISP ends in P, not E. So PRIZE seems the best fit.

Let’s consolidate everything we know after four guesses.

1. From SLATE:  
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.  
   - L, A, T are NOT in the word.

2. From HEXES:  
   - H, X are NOT in the word.  
   - E is in position 4 (✓).  
   - S is in position 5 (✓).

3. From PRIZE:  
   - P, R, I, Z are NOT in the word.  
   - E is in position 5 (✓).  

So the word must:
- End in E (position 5).  
- Have E in position 4 (from HEXES).  
- Contain S somewhere (but not position 1).  
- Exclude L, A, T, H, X, P, R, I, Z.

The only remaining letters we haven’t ruled out are: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E with an E in position 4 and an S somewhere in positions 2-4 (since position 5 is E).  
But position 4 is already E, so S must be in position 2 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- _ S E _ E  
- _ _ E S E  

Looking for valid English words:
- BRISE (but R, I are excluded)  
- CRISP (but ends in P)  
- DRIPS (but ends in S)  
- BRISK (but ends in K)  
- CRISP (but ends in P)  
- PRISM (but ends in M)  
- DRIPS (but ends in S)  
- FRISK (but ends in K)  
- CRISP (but ends in P)  

Valid candidates:
- CRISP (invalid, ends in P)  
- DRIPS (invalid, ends in S)  
- BRISK (invalid, ends in K)  

Wait, let’s list all 5-letter words ending in E, with E in position 4, and S in position 2 or 3, using only allowed letters.

Possible words:
- BESSE (not a word)  
- CESSÉ (not a word)  
- DENSE (but N is allowed, S is in position 2, E in 4, ends in E)  
- MENSE (not a word)  
- WESSE (not a word)  

The only valid word fitting is DENSE.

Check DENSE:
- D N S E E  
- Ends in E (position 5 ✓)  
- E in position 4 (✓)  
- S in position 3 (valid, not position 1)  
- No excluded letters (L, A, T, H, X, P, R, I, Z).  

So the next guess is DENSE.

Let's update what we now know after five guesses.

Letters known to be in the word:
- S (must be in positions 2, 3, or 4)
- E (must be in positions 2, 3, or 4; position 5 is excluded)
- N (must be in position 3)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
L, A, T, H, X, P, R, I, Z, D

So the word looks like:
_ _ N _ _
with E and S somewhere in positions 2 or 4 (since position 3 is N).

Possible patterns:
- E N S _ _  (but S must be in positions 2,3,4; position 3 is N, so S must be 2 or 4)
- _ E N S _  (but S must be in positions 2,3,4; position 3 is N, so S must be 2 or 4)
- _ _ N E S  (but S must be in positions 2,3,4; position 3 is N, so S must be 2 or 4)

Wait, let's think systematically:
Positions 1,2,3,4,5
Known:
- Position 3 = N
- One of positions 2 or 4 = E
- One of positions 2,3,4 = S (but 3 is N, so S must be 2 or 4)

So possibilities:
1. S E N _ _  (but E must be 2 or 4, so this would have E in 2 and S in 2 - impossible)
2. _ E N S _  (E in 2, S in 4)
3. _ _ N E S  (E in 4, S in 5 - but S cannot be 5 from SLATE feedback)

Thus the only possible pattern is _ E N S _ or _ _ N E S, but S cannot be 5, so _ E N S _.

So the word is _ E N S _ with E in 2, N in 3, S in 4.

Letters left to choose from for positions 1 and 5 (excluding all excluded letters):
Allowed letters: B, C, F, G, J, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y

Possible words:
- B E N S _  (BENS? not a word)
- C E N S _  (CENS? not a word)
- F E N S _  (FENS? not a word)
- G E N S _  (GENS? not a word)
- J E N S _  (JENS? not a word)
- K E N S _  (KENS? not a word)
- M E N S _  (MENS? not a word)
- O E N S _  (OENS? not a word)
- U E N S _  (UENS? not a word)
- V E N S _  (VENS? not a word)
- W E N S _  (WENS? not a word)
- Y E N S _  (YENS? not a word)

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let's reconsider the pattern.

Alternative approach: since S must be in positions 2,3, or 4, and N must be in 3, S must be 2 or 4.

Possible patterns:
- S _ N _ _  (S in 2)
- _ _ N S _  (S in 4)

But E must be in positions 2,3, or 4, and position 3 is N, so E must be 2 or 4.

Thus:
1. S E N _ _  (E in 2, S in 2 - impossible)
2. S _ N E _  (E in 4, S in 2)
3. _ E N S _  (E in 2, S in 4)
4. _ _ N E S  (E in 4, S in 5 - impossible)

So valid patterns are:
- S _ N E _  (S in 2, E in 4)
- _ E N S _  (E in 2, S in 4)

Let's check these:

For S _ N E _:
- S _ N E _  (S in 2, N in 3, E in 4)
- Possible words: S B N E _ (invalid), S C N E _ (invalid), etc. - nothing valid.

For _ E N S _:
- _ E N S _  (E in 2, N in 3, S in 4)
- Possible words: B E N S _ (BENS? no), C E N S _ (CENS? no), F E N S _ (FENS? no), G E N S _ (GENS? no), K E N S _ (KENS? no), M E N S _ (MENS? no), O E N S _ (OENS? no), U E N S _ (UENS? no), V E N S _ (VENS? no), W E N S _ (WENS? no), Y E N S _ (YENS? no)

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe the word has E in 2 and S in 4, but the first letter is allowed to be any remaining letter.

Looking at valid English words ending with E, with N in 3, E in 2, S in 4:
- B E N S E (BENSE - not a word)
- C E N S E (CENSE - not a word)
- D E N S E (DENSE - but D is excluded)
- F E N S E (FENSE - not a word)
- G E N S E (GENSE - not a word)
- M E N S E (MENSE - not a word)
- W E N S E (WENSE - not a word)

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let's re-examine the constraints.

Wait, from DENSE feedback:
D(x) E(-) N(✓) S(-) E(-)

This means:
- N is in position 3 (✓)
- E is in the word but not in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from DENSE feedback: E(-) in 2, 4, 5)
- S is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5 (from DENSE feedback: S(-) in 2, 5)

So S must be in position 3 or 4, but position 3 is N, so S must be in position 4.

E must be in positions 1 or 3, but position 3 is N, so E must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be:
E _ N S _

With:
- E in 1
- N in 3
- S in 4

Letters left to choose for positions 2 and 5 (from remaining allowed: B, C, F, G, J, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y)

Possible words:
- E B N S _ (EBNS? no)
- E C N S _ (ECNS? no)
- E F N S _ (EFNS? no)
- E G N S _ (EGNS? no)
- E K N S _ (EKNS? no)
- E M N S _ (EMNS? no)
- E O N S _ (EO NS? no)
- E U N S _ (EUNS? no)
- E V N S _ (EVNS? no)
- E W N S _ (EWNS? no)
- E Y N S _ (EYN S? no)

This is impossible. Clearly, I must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Let me re-express all constraints clearly:

From SLATE:
- S is in word, not position 1
- E is in word, not position 5
- L, A, T are not in word

From HEXES:
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)
- H, X are not in word

From PRIZE:
- E is in position 5 (✓) - this contradicts HEXES where E was in position 4 (✓). This indicates the feedback is inconsistent, but likely the feedback for PRIZE is:
  - P(x) R(x) I(x) Z(x) E(-)  meaning E is in word but not position 5.

Thus, combining:
- From HEXES: E is in position 4 (✓), S is in position 5 (✓)
- From PRIZE: E is in word but not position 5 (consistent, since E is in 4)
- From SLATE: E is in word but not position 5 (consistent)

Thus the word must be:
_ _ _ E S  with:
- S in position 5 (✓ from HEXES)
- E in position 4 (✓ from HEXES)
- S is in word, not position 1 (consistent)
- No L, A, T, H, X, P, R, I, Z

So the word is _ _ _ E S with:
- No L, A, T, H, X, P, R, I, Z
- S is in position 5
- E is in position 4

Possible first three letters from remaining: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y

Looking for valid 5-letter words ending in ES:
- BESSE (not a word)
- CESSÉ (not a word)
- DENSE (but D is excluded)
- FESSE (not a word)
- GESSE (not a word)
- KESSE (not a word)
- MENSE (not a word)
- N E S E S (not a word)
- O E S E S (not a word)
- U E S E S (not a word)
- W E S E S (not a word)

This seems impossible. Clearly, there's a contradiction in the feedback interpretation.

Re-examining HEXES feedback: H(x) E(-) X(x) E(✓) S(✓)
This means:
- H is not in word
- E is in word but not position 2 (from E(-))
- X is not in word
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)

Thus the word is _ _ _ E S with E in 4 and S in 5.

From SLATE: E is in word but not position 5 (consistent, since E is in 4)

From PRIZE: E is in word but not position 5 (consistent)

Thus the word is _ _ _ E S

Possible words:
- BESSE (not a word)
- CESSÉ (not a word)
- DENSE (D excluded)
- FESSE (not a word)
- GESSE (not a word)
- KESSE (not a word)
- MENSE (not a word)
- N E S E S (not a word)
- O E S E S (not a word)
- U E S E S (not a word)
- W E S E S (not a word)

This is impossible. Therefore, the only possible word left is DENSE, but D is excluded. This suggests the word must be _ _ _ E S with remaining letters.

Looking at remaining letters: B, C, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y

Possible valid words:
- BONES (but E is in 4, S in 5)
- BONES: B O N E S
- Check constraints:
  - E in 4 (✓)
  - S in 5 (✓)
  - No L, A, T, H, X, P, R, I, Z
  - B, O, N are allowed
  - BONES is a valid word

Thus the word must be BONES.

<guess>BONES</guess>
</think>

<guess>BONES</guess>",BONES,"Let's update what we now know after five guesses.

Letters known to be in the word:
- S (must be in positions 2, 3, or 4)
- E (must be in positions 2, 3, or 4; position 5 is excluded)
- N (must be in position 3)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
L, A, T, H, X, P, R, I, Z, D

So the word looks like:
_ _ N _ _
with E and S somewhere in positions 2 or 4 (since position 3 is N).

Possible patterns:
- E N S _ _  (but S must be in positions 2,3,4; position 3 is N, so S must be 2 or 4)
- _ E N S _  (but S must be in positions 2,3,4; position 3 is N, so S must be 2 or 4)
- _ _ N E S  (but S must be in positions 2,3,4; position 3 is N, so S must be 2 or 4)

Wait, let's think systematically:
Positions 1,2,3,4,5
Known:
- Position 3 = N
- One of positions 2 or 4 = E
- One of positions 2,3,4 = S (but 3 is N, so S must be 2 or 4)

So possibilities:
1. S E N _ _  (but E must be 2 or 4, so this would have E in 2 and S in 2 - impossible)
2. _ E N S _  (E in 2, S in 4)
3. _ _ N E S  (E in 4, S in 5 - but S cannot be 5 from SLATE feedback)

Thus the only possible pattern is _ E N S _ or _ _ N E S, but S cannot be 5, so _ E N S _.

So the word is _ E N S _ with E in 2, N in 3, S in 4.

Letters left to choose from for positions 1 and 5 (excluding all excluded letters):
Allowed letters: B, C, F, G, J, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y

Possible words:
- B E N S _  (BENS? not a word)
- C E N S _  (CENS? not a word)
- F E N S _  (FENS? not a word)
- G E N S _  (GENS? not a word)
- J E N S _  (JENS? not a word)
- K E N S _  (KENS? not a word)
- M E N S _  (MENS? not a word)
- O E N S _  (OENS? not a word)
- U E N S _  (UENS? not a word)
- V E N S _  (VENS? not a word)
- W E N S _  (WENS? not a word)
- Y E N S _  (YENS? not a word)

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let's reconsider the pattern.

Alternative approach: since S must be in positions 2,3, or 4, and N must be in 3, S must be 2 or 4.

Possible patterns:
- S _ N _ _  (S in 2)
- _ _ N S _  (S in 4)

But E must be in positions 2,3, or 4, and position 3 is N, so E must be 2 or 4.

Thus:
1. S E N _ _  (E in 2, S in 2 - impossible)
2. S _ N E _  (E in 4, S in 2)
3. _ E N S _  (E in 2, S in 4)
4. _ _ N E S  (E in 4, S in 5 - impossible)

So valid patterns are:
- S _ N E _  (S in 2, E in 4)
- _ E N S _  (E in 2, S in 4)

Let's check these:

For S _ N E _:
- S _ N E _  (S in 2, N in 3, E in 4)
- Possible words: S B N E _ (invalid), S C N E _ (invalid), etc. - nothing valid.

For _ E N S _:
- _ E N S _  (E in 2, N in 3, S in 4)
- Possible words: B E N S _ (BENS? no), C E N S _ (CENS? no), F E N S _ (FENS? no), G E N S _ (GENS? no), K E N S _ (KENS? no), M E N S _ (MENS? no), O E N S _ (OENS? no), U E N S _ (UENS? no), V E N S _ (VENS? no), W E N S _ (WENS? no), Y E N S _ (YENS? no)

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe the word has E in 2 and S in 4, but the first letter is allowed to be any remaining letter.

Looking at valid English words ending with E, with N in 3, E in 2, S in 4:
- B E N S E (BENSE - not a word)
- C E N S E (CENSE - not a word)
- D E N S E (DENSE - but D is excluded)
- F E N S E (FENSE - not a word)
- G E N S E (GENSE - not a word)
- M E N S E (MENSE - not a word)
- W E N S E (WENSE - not a word)

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let's re-examine the constraints.

Wait, from DENSE feedback:
D(x) E(-) N(✓) S(-) E(-)

This means:
- N is in position 3 (✓)
- E is in the word but not in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from DENSE feedback: E(-) in 2, 4, 5)
- S is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5 (from DENSE feedback: S(-) in 2, 5)

So S must be in position 3 or 4, but position 3 is N, so S must be in position 4.

E must be in positions 1 or 3, but position 3 is N, so E must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be:
E _ N S _

With:
- E in 1
- N in 3
- S in 4

Letters left to choose for positions 2 and 5 (from remaining allowed: B, C, F, G, J, K, M, O, U, V, W, Y)

Possible words:
- E B N S _ (EBNS? no)
- E C N S _ (ECNS? no)
- E F N S _ (EFNS? no)
- E G N S _ (EGNS? no)
- E K N S _ (EKNS? no)
- E M N S _ (EMNS? no)
- E O N S _ (EO NS? no)
- E U N S _ (EUNS? no)
- E V N S _ (EVNS? no)
- E W N S _ (EWNS? no)
- E Y N S _ (EYN S? no)

This is impossible. Clearly, I must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Let me re-express all constraints clearly:

From SLATE:
- S is in word, not position 1
- E is in word, not position 5
- L, A, T are not in word

From HEXES:
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)
- H, X are not in word

From PRIZE:
- E is in position 5 (✓) - this contradicts HEXES where E was in position 4 (✓). This indicates the feedback is inconsistent, but likely the feedback for PRIZE is:
  - P(x) R(x) I(x) Z(x) E(-)  meaning E is in word but not position 5.

Thus, combining:
- From HEXES: E is in position 4 (✓), S is in position 5 (✓)
- From PRIZE: E is in word but not position 5 (consistent, since E is in 4)
- From SLATE: E is in word but not position 5 (consistent)

Thus the word must be:
_ _ _ E S  with:
- S in position 5 (✓ from HEXES)
- E in position 4 (✓ from HEXES)
- S is in word, not position 1 (consistent)
- No L, A, T, H, X, P, R, I, Z

So the word is _ _ _ E S with:
- No L, A, T, H, X, P, R, I, Z
- S is in position 5
- E is in position 4

Possible first three letters from remaining: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y

Looking for valid 5-letter words ending in ES:

- MENSE (not a word)
- N E S E S (not a word)
- O E S E S (not a word)
- U E S E S (not a word)
- W E S E S (not a word)

This seems impossible. Clearly, there's a contradiction in the feedback interpretation.

Re-examining HEXES feedback: H(x) E(-) X(x) E(✓) S(✓)
This means:
- H is not in word
- E is in word but not position 2 (from E(-))
- X is not in word
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (✓)

Thus the word is _ _ _ E S with E in 4 and S in 5.

From SLATE: E is in word but not position 5 (consistent, since E is in 4)

From PRIZE: E is in word but not position 5 (consistent)

Thus the word is _ _ _ E S

Possible words:

This is impossible. Therefore, the only possible word left is DENSE, but D is excluded. This suggests the word must be _ _ _ E S with remaining letters.

Looking at remaining letters: B, C, F, G, J, K, M, N, O, U, V, W, Y

Possible valid words:
- BONES (but E is in 4, S in 5)
- BONES: B O N E S
- Check constraints:
  - E in 4 (✓)
  - S in 5 (✓)
  - No L, A, T, H, X, P, R, I, Z
