For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (very common)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives a good spread of common letters to maximize information gain from the first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 5).
- S, L, T are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: _ _ A _ _
and E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps the known A in position 3.
2. Includes the known E in a new position (1, 2, or 4).
3. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet, like R, N, I, C, O, etc.

A good candidate is ""EARLY"":
- E in position 1 (new position for E).
- A in position 3 (already confirmed).
- R, L, Y are new letters; L was already ruled out, so R and Y are fresh.
- However, L was marked as (x), so I should avoid L.

Better choice: ""CRANE""
- C, R, N are new common letters.
- A is fixed in position 3.
- E is moved to position 5 (but we know E is not in position 5 from feedback). So this is invalid.

Next: ""EARNS""
- E in position 1.
- A in position 3.
- R, N, S are new letters.
- S was already ruled out (x), so this is invalid.

Next: ""PEACH""
- P, C, H are new.
- E in position 2 (new position).
- A in position 3.
This seems valid.

But let me check another: ""RAISE""
- R, I, S are new, but S is ruled out.

""PEACH"" seems best:
- P, C, H are new.
- E in position 2.
- A in position 3.

But let me think of another: ""EARLY"" was invalid because L is ruled out.

""PEACH"" is good, but let's see ""CRANE"" again: E can't be in 5, so no.

""PEACH"" is valid.

Another: ""PEACH"" or ""GRAPE"" (but G, P, R are new, E in position 4).

""GRAPE"":
- G, R, P are new.
- A in position 3.
- E in position 4 (new position).

This seems good.

Between ""PEACH"" and ""GRAPE"", ""GRAPE"" includes more common letters (G, R, P) and E in position 4.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 5).
- S, L, T are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: _ _ A _ _
and E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps the known A in position 3.
2. Includes the known E in a new position (1, 2, or 4).
3. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet, like R, N, I, C, O, etc.

A good candidate is ""EARLY"":
- E in position 1 (new position for E).
- A in position 3 (already confirmed).
- R, L, Y are new letters; L was already ruled out, so R and Y are fresh.
- However, L was marked as (x), so I should avoid L.

Better choice: ""CRANE""
- C, R, N are new common letters.
- A is fixed in position 3.
- E is moved to position 5 (but we know E is not in position 5 from feedback). So this is invalid.

Next: ""EARNS""
- E in position 1.
- A in position 3.
- R, N, S are new letters.
- S was already ruled out (x), so this is invalid.

Next: ""PEACH""
- P, C, H are new.
- E in position 2 (new position).
- A in position 3.
This seems valid.

But let me check another: ""RAISE""
- R, I, S are new, but S is ruled out.

""PEACH"" seems best:
- P, C, H are new.
- E in position 2.
- A in position 3.

But let me think of another: ""EARLY"" was invalid because L is ruled out.

""PEACH"" is good, but let's see ""CRANE"" again: E can't be in 5, so no.

""PEACH"" is valid.

Another: ""PEACH"" or ""GRAPE"" (but G, P, R are new, E in position 4).

""GRAPE"":
- G, R, P are new.
- A in position 3.
- E in position 4 (new position).

This seems good.

Between ""PEACH"" and ""GRAPE"", ""GRAPE"" includes more common letters (G, R, P) and E in position 4.

So I'll go with GRAPE.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(-)  
   - A is locked in position 3.  
   - E is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from SLATE and GRAPE).  
   - S, L, T, G, R, P are all ruled out.

2. GRAPE → G(x) R(x) A(✓) P(x) E(-)  
   - Confirms A in position 3 again.  
   - E is not in position 4 (from GRAPE) either.  
   - Adds G, R, P as absent.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ A _ _
- E must appear in position 1 or 2 (only remaining spots).
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding ruled-out ones).

I want a word that:
- Keeps A in position 3.
- Places E in position 1 or 2.
- Uses new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (C, N, I, O, etc.).

Candidate: E _ A _ _  
- EA is common; try “EARLY” but L is ruled out.  
- “EARTH” – but T is ruled out.  
- “EACHY” – Y is less common.  

Candidate: _ E A _ _  
- “BEACH” – B, C, H are new.  
  - B, E, A, C, H.  
  - E is in position 2 (new spot).  
  - C, H haven’t been tested.  
  - No ruled-out letters.

“BEACH” satisfies all constraints.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Known facts:
- Position 3 is A (✓).
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from SLATE, GRAPE, BEACH feedback).  
  Therefore E must be in position 1.
- Letters already eliminated (marked x in any position):  
  S, L, T, G, R, P, B, C, H.

So the pattern is: E _ A _ _ and the remaining letters must come from the unused alphabet minus the eliminated set.

Remaining common letters: D, F, I, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 4, and one for position 5.  
We want a valid 5-letter word that fits E _ A _ _ and uses only allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- E _ A _ _  
  – EMAID (not a word)  
  – EMANC (not a word)  
  – EVADE (D is allowed, but V is allowed, E is in 1, A is in 3, D is allowed)  
    – E V A D E: D is allowed, second E is allowed (repetition not ruled out).  
    – EVADE is a valid word.

Let’s verify EVADE:
- E (position 1) – allowed.  
- V – not yet tested.  
- A (position 3) – confirmed.  
- D – not yet tested.  
- E (position 5) – allowed (E only needs to appear once, but can appear again).

This fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (very common)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives a good spread of common letters to maximize information gain from the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 5).
- S, L, T are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: _ _ A _ _
and E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps the known A in position 3.
2. Includes the known E in a new position (1, 2, or 4).
3. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet, like R, N, I, C, O, etc.

A good candidate is ""EARLY"":
- E in position 1 (new position for E).
- A in position 3 (already confirmed).
- R, L, Y are new letters; L was already ruled out, so R and Y are fresh.
- However, L was marked as (x), so I should avoid L.

Better choice: ""CRANE""
- C, R, N are new common letters.
- A is fixed in position 3.
- E is moved to position 5 (but we know E is not in position 5 from feedback). So this is invalid.

Next: ""EARNS""
- E in position 1.
- A in position 3.
- R, N, S are new letters.
- S was already ruled out (x), so this is invalid.

Next: ""PEACH""
- P, C, H are new.
- E in position 2 (new position).
- A in position 3.
This seems valid.

But let me check another: ""RAISE""
- R, I, S are new, but S is ruled out.

""PEACH"" seems best:
- P, C, H are new.
- E in position 2.
- A in position 3.

But let me think of another: ""EARLY"" was invalid because L is ruled out.

""PEACH"" is good, but let's see ""CRANE"" again: E can't be in 5, so no.

""PEACH"" is valid.

Another: ""PEACH"" or ""GRAPE"" (but G, P, R are new, E in position 4).

""GRAPE"":
- G, R, P are new.
- A in position 3.
- E in position 4 (new position).

This seems good.

Between ""PEACH"" and ""GRAPE"", ""GRAPE"" includes more common letters (G, R, P) and E in position 4.

So I'll go with GRAPE.

From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

1. A is locked in position 3.
2. E is in the word but cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from the four “-” marks).  
   The only remaining position for E is position 1.

3. Letters already ruled out (x in any position):  
   S, L, T, G, R, P, B, C, H, V, D.

So the pattern is: E _ A _ _ and the remaining letters must be chosen from the unused alphabet excluding the eliminated set.

Remaining common letters: F, I, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 4, and one for position 5.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C, etc. 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (very common)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives a good spread of common letters to maximize information gain from the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (so it’s not in position 5).
- S, L, T are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is: _ _ A _ _
and E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.

I want a new guess that:
1. Keeps the known A in position 3.
2. Includes the known E in a new position (1, 2, or 4).
3. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet, like R, N, I, C, O, etc.

A good candidate is ""EARLY"":
- E in position 1 (new position for E).
- A in position 3 (already confirmed).
- R, L, Y are new letters; L was already ruled out, so R and Y are fresh.
- However, L was marked as (x), so I should avoid L.

Better choice: ""CRANE""
- C, R, N are new common letters.
- A is fixed in position 3.
- E is moved to position 5 (but we know E is not in position 5 from feedback). So this is invalid.

Next: ""EARNS""
- E in position 1.
- A in position 3.
- R, N, S are new letters.
- S was already ruled out (x), so this is invalid.

Next: ""PEACH""
- P, C, H are new.
- E in position 2 (new position).
- A in position 3.
This seems valid.

But let me check another: ""RAISE""
- R, I, S are new, but S is ruled out.

""PEACH"" seems best:
- P, C, H are new.
- E in position 2.
- A in position 3.

But let me think of another: ""EARLY"" was invalid because L is ruled out.

""PEACH"" is good, but let's see ""CRANE"" again: E can't be in 5, so no.

""PEACH"" is valid.

Another: ""PEACH"" or ""GRAPE"" (but G, P, R are new, E in position 4).

""GRAPE"":
- G, R, P are new.
- A in position 3.
- E in position 4 (new position).

This seems good.

Between ""PEACH"" and ""GRAPE"", ""GRAPE"" includes more common letters (G, R, P) and E in position 4.

So I'll go with GRAPE.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: GRAPE -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(x) A(✓) P(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(-)  
   - A is locked in position 3.  
   - E is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from SLATE and GRAPE).  
   - S, L, T, G, R, P are all ruled out.

2. GRAPE → G(x) R(x) A(✓) P(x) E(-)  
   - Confirms A in position 3 again.  
   - E is not in position 4 (from GRAPE) either.  
   - Adds G, R, P as absent.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ A _ _
- E must appear in position 1 or 2 (only remaining spots).
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding ruled-out ones).

I want a word that:
- Keeps A in position 3.
- Places E in position 1 or 2.
- Uses new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (C, N, I, O, etc.).

Candidate: E _ A _ _  
- EA is common; try “EARLY” but L is ruled out.  
- “EARTH” – but T is ruled out.  
- “EACHY” – Y is less common.  

Candidate: _ E A _ _  
- “BEACH” – B, C, H are new.  
  - B, E, A, C, H.  
  - E is in position 2 (new spot).  
  - C, H haven’t been tested.  
  - No ruled-out letters.

“BEACH” satisfies all constraints.

Guess 3: BEACH -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) A(✓) C(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Known facts:
- Position 3 is A (✓).
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from SLATE, GRAPE, BEACH feedback).  
  Therefore E must be in position 1.
- Letters already eliminated (marked x in any position):  
  S, L, T, G, R, P, B, C, H.

So the pattern is: E _ A _ _ and the remaining letters must come from the unused alphabet minus the eliminated set.

Remaining common letters: D, F, I, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two more letters for positions 2 and 4, and one for position 5.  
We want a valid 5-letter word that fits E _ A _ _ and uses only allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- E _ A _ _  
  – EMAID (not a word)  
  – EMANC (not a word)  
  – EVADE (D is allowed, but V is allowed, E is in 1, A is in 3, D is allowed)  
    – E V A D E: D is allowed, second E is allowed (repetition not ruled out).  
    – EVADE is a valid word.

Let’s verify EVADE:
- E (position 1) – allowed.  
- V – not yet tested.  
- A (position 3) – confirmed.  
- D – not yet tested.  
- E (position 5) – allowed (E only needs to appear once, but can appear again).

This fits all constraints.

Introduces new common letters that haven’t been tested yet, like R, N, I, C, O, etc.\n\nA good candidate is ""EARLY"":\n- E in position 1 (new position for E).\n- A in position 3 (already confirmed).\n- R, L, Y are new letters; L was already ruled out, so R and Y are fresh.\n- However, L was marked as (x), so I should avoid L.\n\nBetter choice: ""CRANE""\n- C, R, N are new common letters.\n- A is fixed in position 3.\n- E is moved to position 5 (but we know E is not in position 5 from feedback). So this is invalid.\n\nNext: ""EARNS""\n- E in position 1.\n- A in position 3.\n- R, N, S are new letters.\n- S was already ruled out (x), so this is invalid.\n\nNext: ""PEACH""\n- P, C, H are new.\n- E in position 2 (new position).\n- A in position 3.\nThis seems valid.\n\nBut let me check another: ""RAISE""\n- R, I, S are new, but S is ruled out.\n\n""PEACH"" seems best:\n- P, C, H are new.\n- E in position 2.\n- A in position 3.\n\nBut let me think of another: ""EARLY"" was invalid because L is ruled out.\n\n""PEACH"" is good, but let\'s see ""CRANE"" again: E can\'t be in 5, so no.\n\n""PEACH"" is valid.\n\nAnother: ""PEACH"" or ""GRAPE"" (but G, P, R are new, E in position 4).\n\n""GRAPE"":\n- G, R, P are new.\n- A in position 3.\n- E in position 4 (new position).\n\nThis seems good.\n\nBetween ""PEACH"" and ""GRAPE"", ""GRAPE"" includes more common letters (G, R, P) and E in position 4.\n\nSo I\'ll go with GRAPE.\n\n<guess>GRAPE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: GRAPE -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(x) A(✓) P(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two rounds of feedback:\n\n1.

From the four rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → A is fixed in position 3.  
   E is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, 5 (from SLATE, GRAPE, BEACH).  
   Therefore E must be in position 1.

2. EVADE → E(-) V(x) A(✓) D(x) E(-)  
   - E is still in the word but cannot be in position 1 (it got “-” here).  
   - V and D are now ruled out.

So the pattern is: _ E A _ _  
and E must appear exactly once in the word (since it can’t be in 1, 2, 4, or 5).

Allowed letters so far:  
- Position 1: any letter not yet ruled out (S, L, T, G, R, P, B, C, H, V, D are out).  
- Position 2: E (fixed).  
- Position 3: A (fixed).  
- Positions 4 & 5: any letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining common letters: F, I, J, K, M, N, O, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4/5.  
A valid word fitting _ E A _ _ with no banned letters is “FEAST” but S and T are banned.  
“FEARY” – F, E, A, R, Y: R is banned.  
“FEINT” – N is allowed, T is banned.  
“FEZER” – Z, E, R: R banned.  
“FEWER” – W, E, R: R banned.  
“FENIX” – X is allowed, I is allowed.

“FENIX” is a valid 5-letter word, uses only allowed letters, and fits the pattern.

Let’s check:
- F: not ruled out.  
- E: position 2 (allowed).  
- A: position 3 (fixed).  
- N: not ruled out.  
- I, X: not ruled out.

This satisfies all constraints.
