1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information we can gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Common letters in English include: A, E, R, S, T, L, N, I, O, U, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q.

A well-known optimal starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of common consonants and vowels to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.
- Contains E, but E is not in the last position.

Letters we can eliminate: S, L, A, T  
Letters we know are present: E (somewhere except 5th)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses none of S, L, A, T.
2. Contains E somewhere in positions 1-4.
3. Uses only common remaining letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q  
Good remaining vowels: E (already known), I, O, U

A balanced choice is a word that introduces several new common letters while placing E in a new spot.  
""REIGN"" is a strong candidate:
- R, I, G, N are all common and untested.
- E is in position 2 (not 5), satisfying the feedback.

Other good options could be ""CHIME"", ""PRIME"", or ""DRIVE"", but ""REIGN"" gives a good spread.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word (x): S, L, A, T, R, I, G, M, O  
Letters that ARE in the word:
- E (in position 2) – but MONEY shows E(-), meaning E is NOT in position 4.  
- N (in position 3) – MONEY shows N(✓), so N is in position 3.  
- Y (in position 5) – MONEY shows Y(✓), so Y is in position 5.

So the word structure is: _ E N _ Y

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4, chosen only from the allowed set, forming a valid English word.

Possible candidates:
- BENCH (but C and H are allowed, and B is allowed) – but E is already in position 2, so BENCH would have E in position 2, N in 3, C in 4, H in 5 – but Y is already in position 5, so H cannot be there. So BENCH is invalid.
- PENNY – P and N are allowed, but N is already in position 3, and we have Y in position 5, so PENNY would have N in position 3 and 4, which is possible, but we don't know if N appears twice.
- JENNY – J and N are allowed, Y is in position 5, so JENNY fits: J E N N Y. This seems valid.
- KENNY – K and N are allowed, Y in position 5, so KENNY fits: K E N N Y.
- PENNY – P E N N Y – but we have only one N confirmed in position 3, so having another N in position 4 is possible, but we have no evidence against it.
- HENRY – R is eliminated, so no.
- BENNY – B E N N Y – B and N are allowed, Y is in position 5, so this is possible.

Among these, JENNY and KENNY are common names, while PENNY and BENNY are also possible. Since we want a valid English word, PENNY is a common word.

But let's check: PENNY has P E N N Y. This fits the structure _ E N _ Y with P in position 1 and N in position 4. This seems valid.

However, MONEY already showed N in position 3, and PENNY would have N in position 4, which is allowed because the feedback only said N is in position 3 (✓), not that N cannot appear elsewhere.

But looking back, MONEY's feedback was:
M(x) O(x) N(✓) E(-) Y(✓)

This means:
- N is in position 3 (✓)
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)

So the word must be _ E N _ Y, with N in position 3, E somewhere else (but not position 4), and Y in position 5.

But MONEY's feedback shows E(-), which means E is not in position 4, but could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. However, we already know from REIGN that E is in position 2 (✓). So E is fixed in position 2.

Therefore the word is _ E N _ Y, with positions 1 and 4 to fill from allowed letters: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Possible words:
- B E N C Y – but C is allowed, but is ""BENCY"" a word? No.
- B E N D Y – ""BENDY"" is a valid word.
- B E N J Y – ""BENJY"" is a name, but not sure if valid.
- P E N C Y – ""PENCY"" not a word.
- P E N D Y – ""PENDY"" not a word.
- D E N S Y – ""DENSE"" is a word, but S is eliminated.
- F E N C Y – ""FENCY"" not a word.
- H E N C Y – ""HENCY"" not a word.
- J E N C Y – ""JENCY"" not a word.
- K E N C Y – ""KENCY"" not a word.
- P E N N Y – ""PENNY"" is a valid word, with N in position 4.
- B E N N Y – ""BENNY"" is a valid word, with N in position 4.
- D E N N Y – ""DENNY"" is a valid word, with N in position 4.

Among these, ""BENNY"", ""PENNY"", ""DENNY"" are all valid. ""BENNY"" and ""PENNY"" are common.

""PENNY"" seems the most common choice here.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information we can gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Common letters in English include: A, E, R, S, T, L, N, I, O, U, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q.

A well-known optimal starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of common consonants and vowels to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.
- Contains E, but E is not in the last position.

Letters we can eliminate: S, L, A, T  
Letters we know are present: E (somewhere except 5th)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses none of S, L, A, T.
2. Contains E somewhere in positions 1-4.
3. Uses only common remaining letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q  
Good remaining vowels: E (already known), I, O, U

A balanced choice is a word that introduces several new common letters while placing E in a new spot.  
""REIGN"" is a strong candidate:
- R, I, G, N are all common and untested.
- E is in position 2 (not 5), satisfying the feedback.

Other good options could be ""CHIME"", ""PRIME"", or ""DRIVE"", but ""REIGN"" gives a good spread.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x): S, L, A, T, R, I, G  
Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or -): E (in position 2), N (somewhere except 5th)

So the secret word:
- Has E in position 2.
- Has N somewhere except position 5.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, R, I, G.

Remaining common letters to try: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with E in position 2.
- Contains N in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

A good candidate is “MONEY”:
- E is in position 2 (matches ✓).
- N is in position 4 (allowed, since it’s not position 5).
- Letters M, O, Y are all new and common.

Other possibilities: “PENNY” (but has N twice), “HENRY” (R is eliminated), “BENCH” (but H is okay), but “MONEY” seems cleanest.

From all feedback so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):

Letters that ARE in the word and their confirmed positions:
- E is in position 2 (✓)
- N is in position 3 (✓)
- N is in position 4 (✓)  → this means the word has N in positions 3 and 4 (i.e., N N in positions 3-4)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)

So the word structure is: _ E N N Y

The only remaining position is position 1, and the allowed letters (not yet eliminated) are:

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with one of these letters and ends in E N N Y.  
The only common word fitting this pattern is “PENNY”, but we already tried “BENNY” and “PENNY” is not yet tested.

However, looking at the letters we have, “PENNY” has P in position 1, which is still allowed.

Wait, we haven’t tried “PENNY” yet. Let me check:  
- P is allowed (not in the x list)  
- E is in position 2 (✓)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information we can gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Common letters in English include: A, E, R, S, T, L, N, I, O, U, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q.

A well-known optimal starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us a good spread of common consonants and vowels to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.
- Contains E, but E is not in the last position.

Letters we can eliminate: S, L, A, T  
Letters we know are present: E (somewhere except 5th)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses none of S, L, A, T.
2. Contains E somewhere in positions 1-4.
3. Uses only common remaining letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, X, Z, J, Q  
Good remaining vowels: E (already known), I, O, U

A balanced choice is a word that introduces several new common letters while placing E in a new spot.  
""REIGN"" is a strong candidate:
- R, I, G, N are all common and untested.
- E is in position 2 (not 5), satisfying the feedback.

Other good options could be ""CHIME"", ""PRIME"", or ""DRIVE"", but ""REIGN"" gives a good spread.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x): S, L, A, T, R, I, G  
Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or -): E (in position 2), N (somewhere except 5th)

So the secret word:
- Has E in position 2.
- Has N somewhere except position 5.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, R, I, G.

Remaining common letters to try: B, C, D, F, H, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with E in position 2.
- Contains N in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

A good candidate is “MONEY”:
- E is in position 2 (matches ✓).
- N is in position 4 (allowed, since it’s not position 5).
- Letters M, O, Y are all new and common.

Other possibilities: “PENNY” (but has N twice), “HENRY” (R is eliminated), “BENCH” (but H is okay), but “MONEY” seems cleanest.

<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word (x): S, L, A, T, R, I, G, M, O  
Letters that ARE in the word:
- E (in position 2) – but MONEY shows E(-), meaning E is NOT in position 4.  
- N (in position 3) – MONEY shows N(✓), so N is in position 3.  
- Y (in position 5) – MONEY shows Y(✓), so Y is in position 5.

So the word structure is: _ E N _ Y

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4, chosen only from the allowed set, forming a valid English word.

Possible candidates:
- BENCH (but C and H are allowed, and B is allowed) – but E is already in position 2, so BENCH would have E in position 2, N in 3, C in 4, H in 5 – but Y is already in position 5, so H cannot be there. So BENCH is invalid.
- PENNY – P and N are allowed, but N is already in position 3, and we have Y in position 5, so PENNY would have N in position 3 and 4, which is possible, but we don't know if N appears twice.
- JENNY – J and N are allowed, Y is in position 5, so JENNY fits: J E N N Y. This seems valid.
- KENNY – K and N are allowed, Y in position 5, so KENNY fits: K E N N Y.
- PENNY – P E N N Y – but we have only one N confirmed in position 3, so having another N in position 4 is possible, but we have no evidence against it.
- HENRY – R is eliminated, so no.
- BENNY – B E N N Y – B and N are allowed, Y is in position 5, so this is possible.

Among these, JENNY and KENNY are common names, while PENNY and BENNY are also possible. Since we want a valid English word, PENNY is a common word.

But let's check: PENNY has P E N N Y. This fits the structure _ E N _ Y with P in position 1 and N in position 4. This seems valid.

However, MONEY already showed N in position 3, and PENNY would have N in position 4, which is allowed because the feedback only said N is in position 3 (✓), not that N cannot appear elsewhere.

But looking back, MONEY's feedback was:
M(x) O(x) N(✓) E(-) Y(✓)

This means:
- N is in position 3 (✓)
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)

So the word must be _ E N _ Y, with N in position 3, E somewhere else (but not position 4), and Y in position 5.

But MONEY's feedback shows E(-), which means E is not in position 4, but could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. However, we already know from REIGN that E is in position 2 (✓). So E is fixed in position 2.

Therefore the word is _ E N _ Y, with positions 1 and 4 to fill from allowed letters: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Possible words:
- B E N C Y – but C is allowed, but is ""BENCY"" a word? No.
- B E N D Y – ""BENDY"" is a valid word.
- B E N J Y – ""BENJY"" is a name, but not sure if valid.
- P E N C Y – ""PENCY"" not a word.
- P E N D Y – ""PENDY"" not a word.
- D E N S Y – ""DENSE"" is a word, but S is eliminated.
- F E N C Y – ""FENCY"" not a word.
- H E N C Y – ""HENCY"" not a word.
- J E N C Y – ""JENCY"" not a word.
- K E N C Y – ""KENCY"" not a word.
- P E N N Y – ""PENNY"" is a valid word, with N in position 4.
- B E N N Y – ""BENNY"" is a valid word, with N in position 4.
- D E N N Y – ""DENNY"" is a valid word, with N in position 4.

Among these, ""BENNY"", ""PENNY"", ""DENNY"" are all valid. ""BENNY"" and ""PENNY"" are common.

""PENNY"" seems the most common choice here.Based on the feedback:
- Pattern: _ E N _ Y
- Position 2: E (fixed)
- Position 3: N (fixed)
- Position 5: Y (fixed)
- Positions 1 and 4 must be from remaining letters: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

A valid word fitting this pattern is ""BENNY"".

So BENCH is invalid.\n- PENNY – P and N are allowed, but N is already in position 3, and we have Y in position 5, so PENNY would have N in position 3 and 4, which is possible, but we don\'t know if N appears twice.\n- JENNY – J and N are allowed, Y is in position 5, so JENNY fits: J E N N Y. This seems valid.\n- KENNY – K and N are allowed, Y in position 5, so KENNY fits: K E N N Y.\n- PENNY – P E N N Y – but we have only one N confirmed in position 3, so having another N in position 4 is possible, but we have no evidence against it.\n- HENRY – R is eliminated, so no.\n- BENNY – B E N N Y – B and N are allowed, Y is in position 5, so this is possible.\n\nAmong these, JENNY and KENNY are common names, while PENNY and BENNY are also possible. Since we want a valid English word, PENNY is a common word.\n\nBut let\'s check: PENNY has P E N N Y. This fits the structure _ E N _ Y with P in position 1 and N in position 4. This seems valid.\n\nHowever, MONEY already showed N in position 3, and PENNY would have N in position 4, which is allowed because the feedback only said N is in position 3 (✓), not that N cannot appear elsewhere.\n\nBut looking back, MONEY\'s feedback was:\nM(x) O(x) N(✓) E(-) Y(✓)\n\nThis means:\n- N is in position 3 (✓)\n- E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-)\n- Y is in position 5 (✓)\n\nSo the word must be _ E N _ Y, with N in position 3, E somewhere else (but not position 4), and Y in position 5.\n\nBut MONEY\'s feedback shows E(-), which means E is not in position 4, but could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. However, we already know from REIGN that E is in position 2 (✓). So E is fixed in position 2.\n\nTherefore the word is _ E N _ Y, with positions 1 and 4 to fill from allowed letters: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nPossible words:\n- B E N C Y – but C is allowed, but is ""BENCY"" a word? No.\n- B E N D Y – ""BENDY"" is a valid word.\n- B E N J Y – ""BENJY"" is a name, but not sure if valid.\n- P E N C Y – ""PENCY"" not a word.\n- P E N D Y – ""PENDY"" not a word.\n- D E N S Y – ""DENSE"" is a word, but S is eliminated.\n- F E N C Y – ""FENCY"" not a word.\n- H E N C Y – ""HENCY"" not a word.\n- J E N C Y – ""JENCY"" not a word.\n- K E N C Y – ""KENCY"" not a word.\n- P E N N Y – ""PENNY"" is a valid word, with N in position 4.\n- B E N N Y – ""BENNY"" is a valid word, with N in position 4.\n- D E N N Y – ""DENNY"" is a valid word, with N in position 4.\n\nAmong these, ""BENNY"", ""PENNY"", ""DENNY"" are all valid.

- Remaining possible first letters: C, D, F, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  

Valid 5-letter English words ending in “ENN Y” are extremely rare.  
The only common word that fits is “PENNY”, but we have already tried PENNY and it failed (P is eliminated).  
Next possible candidates:  
- “CENNY” – not a recognized word.  
- “DENNY” – a valid surname/variant spelling of “denny”, but not a standard dictionary word.  
- “FENNY” – a dialectal variant of “fenny”, also uncommon.  
- “HENNY” – a name, not a standard word.  
- “JENNY” – a name, not a standard word.  
- “KENNY” – a name, not a standard word.  
- “VENNY” – a name, not a standard word.  

Given the constraints, the only plausible remaining word is “DENNY”, even though it’s more of a proper noun.  
Since we have exhausted common choices and the feedback rules out every other possibility, “DENNY” must be the intended word.
