For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. A classic strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended because it contains:
- A: very common vowel
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: common consonant
- E: the most common letter in English

This gives us a good spread of letters that are likely to appear in the secret word. Another strong option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" is particularly effective for its vowel coverage and common consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
1. The word contains S and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
2. It does NOT contain A, R, or O.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S and E somewhere (but S not in position 4, E not in position 5).
- Avoids A, R, O.
- Uses other common letters (like T, I, N, L, C, etc.) to maximize information.

A good candidate is “STILE”:
- S is in position 1 (allowed).
- T, I, L are new letters to test.
- E is in position 5 – but wait, the feedback said E is not in position 5. So STILE is invalid.

Next candidate: “STINE”:
- S in position 1 (ok).
- T, I, N are new.
- E in position 5 – again invalid.

Next: “STEIN”:
- S in position 1 (ok).
- T, E, I, N are new letters.
- E is in position 2 (ok, not position 5).
- N in position 5 (ok).

This seems valid and tests new common letters (T, I, N).

Another option: “SLEET” – but E is in position 4 (ok), but we already have S and E, and T is common. However, we want to test new letters.

“STEIN” seems best as it tests T, I, N in new positions.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

From Guess 1 (AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)):

- T is NOT in the word.
- E is in position 3 (✓).
- I is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we have:
- Letters known to be in the word: S, E, I, N
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, T
- Positions ruled out:
  – S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
  – E must be in position 3 (✓).
  – I cannot be in position 4.
  – N cannot be in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 3.
2. Contains S, I, N somewhere (with the above positional restrictions).
3. Avoids A, R, O, T.

Let’s list possible positions for S, I, N:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
           S I E N I  – but I can’t be in position 4, so this is invalid.

Try placing S in position 2:
1 _ E S _ _  – but then N and I must fit in 1,4,5 with N not in 5.

Try S in position 5 (allowed, since S only can’t be 1 or 4):
1 _ E _ S _  – but then N and I must fit in 1,2,4 with N not in 5 (already satisfied) and I not in 4.

Let’s try S in position 5:
1 2 3 4 5
E is fixed in 3.
Possible: N I E S _  – but then N is in 1, I in 2, S in 5. That leaves position 4 empty.

We need 5 letters, so the word must be N I E S plus one more letter, but we already have S, E, I, N.

Wait, we have 4 letters (S, E, I, N) and need one more. But we can’t use A, R, O, T. The remaining common letters are C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to construct a word with E in position 3, and S, I, N in other positions, plus one new letter.

Possible structure: _ I E S N  – but N can’t be in 5, so invalid.

Structure: N I E S _  – need a letter in position 5. Available letters: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Try N I E S C – but that’s 5 letters: N I E S C – but that would be N I E S C, which is 5 letters. But we need to check if it’s a valid word. N I E S C – not a valid word.

Try S in position 2: _ S E _ _  – then N and I must fit in 1,4,5 with N not in 5.

Try I in 1, N in 4, S in 2, E in 3: I S E N _  – need a letter in 5. Available letters: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Try I S E N C – not a valid word.

Try S in position 2: _ S E _ _  – then N and I must fit in 1,4,5 with N not in 5.

Try I in 1, N in 4, S in 2, E in 3: I S E N _  – need a letter in 5. Available letters: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Try I S E N D – not a valid word.

Try N in 1, I in 4, S in 2, E in 3: N S E I _  – need a letter in 5. Available letters: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Try N S E I C – not a valid word.

Try S in position 3 – but E is already in position 3, so invalid.

Try S in position 4 – but S can’t be in 4.

Try S in position 5: _ _ E _ S  – then N and I must fit in 1,2,4 with N not in 5 (already satisfied) and I not in 4.

Try N in 1, I in 2, _ in 4: N I E _ S – need a letter in 4. Available letters: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Try N I E L S – not a valid word.

Try N I E G S – not a valid word.

Try N I E D S – not a valid word.

Try N I E C S – not a valid word.

Try N I E M S – not a valid word.

Try N I E P S – not a valid word.

Try N I E F S – not a valid word.

Try N I E U S – not a valid word.

Try N I E V S – not a valid word.

Try N I E W S – not a valid word.

Try N I E Y S – not a valid word.

Try I in 1, N in 4, S in 5: I _ E N S – need a letter in 2. Available letters: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Try I L E N S – valid word: I L E N S – but we need to check if it contains S, E, I, N and avoids A, R, O, T.

I L E N S:
- Letters: I, L, E, N, S – contains S, E, I, N and adds L.
- Avoids A, R, O, T.
- E is in position 3 (✓).
- S is in position 5 (allowed, since S can’t be 1 or 4).
- I is in position 1 (allowed, since I can’t be 4).
- N is in position 4 (allowed, since N can’t be 5).

This seems valid.

Let’s verify:
- Contains S, E, I, N – yes.
- Avoids A, R, O, T – yes.
- E in position 3 – yes.
- S in position 5 – allowed.
- I in position 1 – allowed.

Let’s try to construct a word with E in position 3, and S, I, N in other positions, plus one new letter.

Possible structure: _ I E S N  – but N can’t be in 5, so invalid.

Structure: N I E S _  – need a letter in position 5. Available letters: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Try N I E S C – but that’s 5 letters: N I E S C – but that would be N I E S C, which is 5 letters. But we need to check if it’s a valid word. N I E S C – not a valid word.

Try S in position 2: _ S E _ _  – then N and I must fit in 1,4,5 with N not in 5.

Try I in 1, N in 4, S in 2, E in 3: I S E N _  – need a letter in 5. Available letters: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Try I in 1, N in 4, S in 2, E in 3: I S E N _  – need a letter in 5. Available letters: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Try I S E N D – not a valid word.

Try N in 1, I in 4, S in 2, E in 3: N S E I _  – need a letter in 5. Available letters: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Try N S E I C – not a valid word.

Try S in position 3 – but E is already in position 3, so invalid.

Try S in position 4 – but S can’t be in 4.

Try S in position 5: _ _ E _ S  – then N and I must fit in 1,2,4 with N not in 5 (already satisfied) and I not in 4.

Try N in 1, I in 2, _ in 4: N I E _ S – need a letter in 4. Available letters: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Try N I E L S – not a valid word.

Try I L E N S – valid word: I L E N S – but we need to check if it contains S, E, I, N and avoids A, R, O, T.

I L E N S:
- Letters: I, L, E, N, S – contains S, E, I, N and adds L.
- Avoids A, R, O, T.
- E is in position 3 (✓).
- S is in position 5 (allowed, since S can’t be 1 or 4).
- I is in position 1 (allowed, since I can’t be 4).
- N is in position 4 (allowed, since N can’t be 5).

This seems valid.

Let’s verify:
- Contains S, E, I, N – yes.
- Avoids A, R, O, T – yes.
- E in position 3 – yes.
- S in position 5 – allowed.
- I in position 1 – allowed.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. A classic strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended because it contains:
- A: very common vowel
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: common consonant
- E: the most common letter in English

This gives us a good spread of letters that are likely to appear in the secret word. Another strong option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" is particularly effective for its vowel coverage and common consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
1. The word contains S and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
2. It does NOT contain A, R, or O.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S and E somewhere (but S not in position 4, E not in position 5).
- Avoids A, R, O.
- Uses other common letters (like T, I, N, L, C, etc.) to maximize information.

A good candidate is “STILE”:
- S is in position 1 (allowed).
- T, I, L are new letters to test.
- E is in position 5 – but wait, the feedback said E is not in position 5. So STILE is invalid.

Next candidate: “STINE”:
- S in position 1 (ok).
- T, I, N are new.
- E in position 5 – again invalid.

Next: “STEIN”:
- S in position 1 (ok).
- T, E, I, N are new letters.
- E is in position 2 (ok, not position 5).
- N in position 5 (ok).

This seems valid and tests new common letters (T, I, N).

Another option: “SLEET” – but E is in position 4 (ok), but we already have S and E, and T is common. However, we want to test new letters.

“STEIN” seems best as it tests T, I, N in new positions.

Let’s consolidate what we now know.

From Guess 1 (AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)):
- The word contains S and E.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or O.
- S is NOT in position 4.
- E is NOT in position 5.

From Guess 2 (STEIN → S(-) T(x) E(✓) I(-) N(-)):
- S is NOT in position 1.
- T is NOT in the word.
- E is in position 3 (✓).
- I is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we have:
- Letters known to be in the word: S, E, I, N
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, T
- Positions ruled out:
  – S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
  – E must be in position 3 (✓).
  – I cannot be in position 4.
  – N cannot be in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 3.
2. Contains S, I, N somewhere (with the above positional restrictions).
3. Avoids A, R, O, T.

Let’s list possible positions for S, I, N:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
           S I E N I  – but I can’t be in position 4, so this is invalid.

Try placing S in position 2:
1 _ E S _ _  – but then N and I must fit in 1,4,5 with N not in 5.

Try S in position 5 (allowed, since S only can’t be 1 or 4):
1 _ E _ S _  – but then N and I must fit in 1,2,4 with N not in 5 (already satisfied) and I not in 4.

Let’s try S in position 5:
1 2 3 4 5
E is fixed in 3.
Possible: N I E S _  – but then N is in 1, I in 2, S in 5. That leaves position 4 empty.

We need 5 letters, so the word must be N I E S plus one more letter, but we already have S, E, I, N.

Wait, we have 4 letters (S, E, I, N) and need one more. But we can’t use A, R, O, T. The remaining common letters are C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try to construct a word with E in position 3, and S, I, N in other positions, plus one new letter.

Possible structure: _ I E S N  – but N can’t be in 5, so invalid.

Try N I E S C – but that’s 5 letters: N I E S C – but that would be N I E S C, which is 5 letters. But we need to check if it’s a valid word. N I E S C – not a valid word.

Try N S E I C – not a valid word.

Try S in position 3 – but E is already in position 3, so invalid.

Try S in position 4 – but S can’t be in 4.

Try S in position 5: _ _ E _ S  – then N and I must fit in 1,2,4 with N not in 5 (already satisfied) and I not in 4.

Try N in 1, I in 2, _ in 4: N I E _ S – need a letter in 4. Available letters: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Try I in 1, N in 4, S in 5: I _ E N S – need a letter in 2. Available letters: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Try I L E N S – valid word: I L E N S – but we need to check if it contains S, E, I, N and avoids A, R, O, T.

I L E N S:
- Letters: I, L, E, N, S – contains S, E, I, N and adds L.
- Avoids A, R, O, T.
- E is in position 3 (✓).
- S is in position 5 (allowed, since S can’t be 1 or 4).
- I is in position 1 (allowed, since I can’t be 4).

This seems valid.

Let’s verify:

Possible positions for L: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (but 3=E, 4=N, 5=S) → positions 1 or 2.

But position 2 cannot be both I and L. So one of them must be in position 1 and the other in position 2.

Case 1: I in position 2, L in position 1 → L I E N S
Case 2: L in position 1, I in position 2 → same as above.

Check if L I E N S is a valid word. Yes, ""LIENS"" is a valid 5-letter word (plural of lien).

But we need to confirm if L is allowed in position 1 and I in position 2:
- L is in position 1 (allowed, since L was marked as in the word but not in position 2).
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since I was marked as in the word but not in position 1).

Thus, the only possible word that fits all constraints is LIENS.",Guess 4: LIENS -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) I(✓) E(✓) N(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
