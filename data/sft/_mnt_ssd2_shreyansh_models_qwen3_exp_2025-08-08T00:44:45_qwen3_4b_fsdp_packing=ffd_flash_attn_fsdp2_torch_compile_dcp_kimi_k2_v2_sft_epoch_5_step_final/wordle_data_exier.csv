For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - covers 5 very common letters.
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - also covers common letters.
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - covers another set of common letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving me good coverage for the first guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - covers 5 very common letters.
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - also covers common letters.
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - covers another set of common letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving me good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → A is not in the word.
- R: - → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O: x → O is not in the word.
- S: x → S is not in the word.
- E: - → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S.
- Contains R somewhere (not in position 2) and E somewhere (not in position 5).

I want a new word that:
1. Uses R and E in different positions than before.
2. Avoids A, O, S.
3. Introduces new common letters to narrow things down.

Good candidates: ""ENTRY"", ""RENTY"", ""TREND"", ""CREPT"", ""DRIVE"", etc.

""ENTRY"" seems good:
- E in position 1 (new position for E).
- N, T, R, Y all new letters.
- R in position 4 (new position for R).
- Avoids A, O, S.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, O, S are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. ENTRY → E(✓) N(x) T(x) R(-) Y(x)
   - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
   - N, T, Y are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 4.

Combining these:
- Word starts with E.
- Contains R somewhere (positions 2, 3, or 5 are still possible).
- Does NOT contain A, O, S, N, T, Y.
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.

Possible remaining letters (excluding the excluded ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

I need a word that:
- Starts with E.
- Has R in position 2, 3, or 5.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- ER... (positions 2,3,4,5)
- E...R (positions 2,3,4,5)

Looking for common words:
- ECRIM (not a word)
- ECLIP (not a word)
- EIDER (has D, I, E, R - but D is allowed)
- EIDER: E(✓) I D E R
  - E in position 1 (correct)
  - R in position 5 (possible)
  - I and D are new letters
  - No excluded letters

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - covers 5 very common letters.
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - also covers common letters.
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - covers another set of common letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving me good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → A is not in the word.
- R: - → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O: x → O is not in the word.
- S: x → S is not in the word.
- E: - → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S.
- Contains R somewhere (not in position 2) and E somewhere (not in position 5).

I want a new word that:
1. Uses R and E in different positions than before.
2. Avoids A, O, S.
3. Introduces new common letters to narrow things down.

Good candidates: ""ENTRY"", ""RENTY"", ""TREND"", ""CREPT"", ""DRIVE"", etc.

""ENTRY"" seems good:
- E in position 1 (new position for E).
- N, T, R, Y all new letters.
- R in position 4 (new position for R).
- Avoids A, O, S.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ENTRY -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) N(x) T(x) R(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, O, S are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. ENTRY → E(✓) N(x) T(x) R(-) Y(x)
   - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
   - N, T, Y are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 4.

Combining these:
- Word starts with E.
- Contains R somewhere (positions 2, 3, or 5 are still possible).
- Does NOT contain A, O, S, N, T, Y.
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.

Possible remaining letters (excluding the excluded ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

I need a word that:
- Starts with E.
- Has R in position 2, 3, or 5.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- ER... (positions 2,3,4,5)
- E...R (positions 2,3,4,5)

Looking for common words:
- ECRIM (not a word)
- ECLIP (not a word)
- EIDER (has D, I, E, R - but D is allowed)
- EIDER: E(✓) I D E R
  - E in position 1 (correct)
  - R in position 5 (possible)
  - I and D are new letters
  - No excluded letters

""EIDER"" seems like a good next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ENTRY -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) N(x) T(x) R(-) Y(x)
Guess 3: EIDER -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) I(-) D(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on EIDER:

- E(✓) – position 1 is correct (already known).
- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 2.
- D(x) – D is not in the word.
- E(✓) – position 4 is correct.
- R(✓) – position 5 is correct.

So the secret word is now fully determined except for position 2.  
It looks like: E _ _ E R  
with the constraints:
- Position 2 must be a letter that is not A, O, S, N, T, Y, D (from earlier exclusions) and also not I (because I is in the word but not in position 2).  
- Position 3 must be a letter that is not yet ruled out.

Remaining candidate letters (excluding the excluded set): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word of the form E _ _ E R.

Common words fitting this pattern:
- EAGER (but A is excluded)
- EAGER – invalid (A excluded)
- ECHER – not a common word
- ELVER – L is allowed
- ELVER: E L V E R  
  - L and V are both allowed.
  - No excluded letters appear.

Therefore, the only plausible word left is ELVER.
