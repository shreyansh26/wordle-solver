For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct positions or at least identifying which letters are present in the word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter S, but not in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (but not in position 4).
2. Excludes A, R, O, E.

Common letters left to try: T, I, N, L, U, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

A good next guess would use several of these remaining common letters while keeping S in a different position. The word ""STINT"" is tempting but repeats T and uses S in position 1 (still possible). However, ""SOUND"" uses S in position 1 and introduces U, N, D, but O is excluded. ""SILKY"" uses S in position 1 and introduces I, L, K, Y. 

A balanced choice is ""SLIMY"":
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- L, I, M, Y are all new letters.
- No excluded letters (A, R, O, E).

Let’s summarize what we now know after the two guesses.

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, M, Y  
2. Letters that ARE in the word (but we still don’t know their exact positions):  
   – S (from both guesses)  
   – L (from SLIMY)  
   – I (from SLIMY)

So the secret word must contain S, L, and I, and it must NOT contain A, R, O, E, M, or Y.

Next, we want a word that:
- Contains S, L, I (in any order)  
- Uses only letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the six letters already ruled out)  
- Has no repeated letters (to maximize information gain)

Remaining common letters: T, N, U, D, P, C, G, H, B, K, etc.

A good candidate is “STILK” (but K is less common).  
Another is “TULIP” (but P is less common).  
A better choice is “STINK” – it uses S, T, I, N, K.  
However, K is less common.  

A more balanced word is “SUNLI” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
“SPLIT” uses S, P, L, I, T. All letters are allowed, and it’s a valid word.

Let’s go with “SPLIT”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct positions or at least identifying which letters are present in the word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter S, but not in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (but not in position 4).
2. Excludes A, R, O, E.

Common letters left to try: T, I, N, L, U, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

A good next guess would use several of these remaining common letters while keeping S in a different position. The word ""STINT"" is tempting but repeats T and uses S in position 1 (still possible). However, ""SOUND"" uses S in position 1 and introduces U, N, D, but O is excluded. ""SILKY"" uses S in position 1 and introduces I, L, K, Y. 

A balanced choice is ""SLIMY"":
- S in position 1 (allowed).
- L, I, M, Y are all new letters.
- No excluded letters (A, R, O, E).

Let’s summarize what we now know after the two guesses.

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, M, Y  
2. Letters that ARE in the word (but we still don’t know their exact positions):  
   – S (from both guesses)  
   – L (from SLIMY)  
   – I (from SLIMY)

So the secret word must contain S, L, and I, and it must NOT contain A, R, O, E, M, or Y.

Next, we want a word that:
- Contains S, L, I (in any order)  
- Uses only letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the six letters already ruled out)  
- Has no repeated letters (to maximize information gain)

Remaining common letters: T, N, U, D, P, C, G, H, B, K, etc.

A good candidate is “STILK” (but K is less common).  
Another is “TULIP” (but P is less common).  
A better choice is “STINK” – it uses S, T, I, N, K.  
However, K is less common.  

A more balanced word is “SUNLI” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
“SPLIT” uses S, P, L, I, T. All letters are allowed, and it’s a valid word.

Let’s go with “SPLIT”.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter S, but not in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

2. Excludes A, R, O, E.

A good next guess would use several of these remaining common letters while keeping S in a different position. The word ""STINT"" is tempting but repeats T and uses S in position 1 (still possible). However, ""SOUND"" uses S in position 1 and introduces U, N, D, but O is excluded. ""SILKY"" uses S in position 1 and introduces I, L, K, Y. 

A balanced choice is ""SLIMY"":

Let’s summarize what we now know after the two guesses.

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, M, Y  
2. Letters that ARE in the word (but we still don’t know their exact positions):

   – L (from SLIMY)  
   – I (from SLIMY)

So the secret word must contain S, L, and I, and it must NOT contain A, R, O, E, M, or Y.

Next, we want a word that:
- Contains S, L, I (in any order)  
- Uses only letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the six letters already ruled out)  
- Has no repeated letters (to maximize information gain)

Remaining common letters: T, N, U, D, P, C, G, H, B, K, etc.

A good candidate is “STILK” (but K is less common).  
Another is “TULIP” (but P is less common).  
A better choice is “STINK” – it uses S, T, I, N, K.  
However, K is less common.  

A more balanced word is “SUNLI” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
“SPLIT” uses S, P, L, I, T. All letters are allowed, and it’s a valid word.

Let’s go with “SPLIT”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SLIMY -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) I(-) M(x) Y(x)
Guess 3: SPLIT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) L(✓) I(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, E, M, Y, P, T
2. Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): S, L, I
3. From SPLIT, we now know:
   - L is in the word and is in position 3 (✓)
   - S is in the word but not in positions 1, 4
   - I is in the word but not in position 4

So the word looks like: _ _ L _ _
and must contain S and I somewhere in positions 2 or 5 (since they can't be in 1,4).

Remaining letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (but we’ll stick to common ones).

We need a valid 5-letter word with:
- L in position 3
- S and I in positions 2 or 5 (but not both in 2 and 5 at once, so one must be in 2 and the other in 5)
- No letters from the banned list

Possible patterns:
- _ S L I _  (but I can't be in position 4, so this is invalid)
- _ I L S _  (valid: I in 2, S in 5)
- _ S L _ I  (valid: S in 2, I in 5)

Looking for valid words:
- ""BILKS"" – but K is allowed, S in 5, I in 2, L in 3. This seems valid.
- ""CILSS"" – invalid (double S)
- ""FILMS"" – M is banned
- ""GILDS"" – G, I, L, D, S – all allowed letters, L in 3, I in 2, S in 5.

""GILDS"" fits all constraints perfectly.

Let’s extract the hard facts from the four guesses.

Known letters in the word (positions confirmed or implied):
- L is in position 3 (✓ in SPLIT and GILDS).
- I is in position 2 (✓ in GILDS).
- S is in position 5 (✓ in GILDS).

So the word pattern is:
_ I L _ S

Letters NOT in the word (from x feedback):
A, R, O, E, M, Y, P, T, G, D

Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 4:
B, C, F, H, J, K, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (but we’ll stick to common ones).

We need a valid 5-letter English word that matches:
- Position 1: any of the allowed letters
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: L
- Position 4: any of the allowed letters
- Position 5: S

Possible candidates:
- BILKS → B and K are allowed, but K is less common.
- FILMS → M is banned.
- NILKS → N and K are allowed.
- SILKS → S is already in position 5, so S cannot appear again (no double S rule here, but SILKS is valid).
- WILKS → W and K are allowed.

Among these, ""SILKS"" is a common word and uses allowed letters (S in 5, I in 2, L in 3, S in 1 is allowed since it’s not banned).

Current confirmed facts:
- Pattern: _ I L _ S (from GILDS and SILKS)

- Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 4: B, C, F, H, J, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Looking at valid 5-letter words that fit _ I L _ S:
- BILKS – K is banned
- FILMS – M is banned
- NILKS – K is banned
- SILKS – K is banned
- WILKS – K is banned

The only remaining common letters for positions 1 and 4 are B, C, F, H, N, U, V, W.  
Valid words left:
- BILUS – not a common word
- FILUS – not common
- NILUS – not common
- WILUS – not common

The only common word left is ""BILUS"" but it’s obscure.  
However, ""BILUS"" is a valid Scrabble word (a type of moth).  
Another candidate is ""FILUS"" (plural of filum), but ""BILUS"" seems more likely.

But wait, ""BILUS"" uses U, which is allowed.  
Let me check if there’s a more common word.  
Actually, ""BILUS"" is the only valid word left fitting the pattern with allowed letters.

However, let me double-check:  
- Position 1: B (allowed)  
- Position 2: I (confirmed)  
- Position 3: L (confirmed)  
- Position 4: U (allowed)  
- Position 5: S (confirmed)

""BILUS"" is valid, but to maximize information, I’ll try ""FILUS"" instead, as it’s also valid and uses F.

But ""FILUS"" is less common.  
Another option is ""NILUS"" – but ""N"" is allowed.  
However, ""N"" is allowed and ""NILUS"" is valid.

But ""NILUS"" is still obscure.  
The most common word left seems to be ""BILUS"".

But to be safe, let me try ""BILUS"" first.
