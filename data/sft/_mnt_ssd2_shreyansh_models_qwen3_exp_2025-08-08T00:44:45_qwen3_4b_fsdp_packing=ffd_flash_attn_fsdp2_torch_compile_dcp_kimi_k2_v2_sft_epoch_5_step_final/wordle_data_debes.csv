For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically contain frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains:
- S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes both S and E.
2. Does NOT include A, R, or O.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Possible candidates:
- ""STEIN"" (S in 1, E in 2) – but contains I and N, which are untested.
- ""SLEEP"" – but has two E’s and P, which may be risky.
- ""STEEP"" – two E’s again.
- ""SHEET"" – two E’s and T.
- ""SEINE"" – S in 1, E in 2, I, N, E in 5 – but E is in position 5 which was wrong for AROSE.
- ""STILE"" – S in 1, E in 5 – again E in 5 is wrong.
- ""SINEC"" – not a valid word.
- ""SLEET"" – S in 1, E in 2, T, E in 4 – E in 4 is new, but we already know E is in the word but not in position 5.

Valid consonants left to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels left to test: U (since A, O, E are partially known).

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S and E in allowed positions.
2. Uses only uneliminated letters.
3. Tests new letters to narrow the field.

Candidate words:
- ""SLEEK"" – uses S and E, but E is in position 2 (forbidden), and K is new.
- ""SHELF"" – S in 1 (forbidden), H, E in 2 (forbidden), L, F.
- ""SWEET"" – S in 1 (forbidden), W, E in 2 (forbidden), E in 4, T (forbidden).
- ""SEEPS"" – E in 1, S in 2, E in 3, P, S in 5. This uses S in 2 and 5 (allowed), E in 1 and 3 (allowed), and tests P.
- ""SLEEP"" – S in 1 (forbidden), L, E in 2 (forbidden), E in 4, P.
- ""SEBUM"" – S in 1 (forbidden), E in 2 (forbidden), B, U, M.
- ""SEWED"" – S in 1 (forbidden), E in 2 (forbidden), W, E in 4, D.

From the three rounds of feedback:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N, P  
Letters that ARE in the word and their exact positions so far:
- E is in position 2 (✓)  
- S is in position 5 (✓)  

Letters still unknown (must appear somewhere):
- S appears once more in the word (because it has been marked ✓ in position 5, and we know it is in the word; but the feedback for SEEPS shows two S’s: the first S is -, the last S is ✓, which means the word has S in position 5 and possibly one more S elsewhere. However, in standard Wordle rules, each letter appears at most once unless specified otherwise. Given the feedback pattern, it is safer to assume S appears only once in position 5.

Thus, the secret word must be:
- 5 letters long
- E in position 2
- S in position 5
- No A, R, O, T, I, N, P
- Allowed letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with letters from the remaining set, and ensure the word is valid.

Possible candidates:
- E in 2, S in 5
- Position 1: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 3: same set
- Position 4: same set

Let’s list valid words:
- BESOM – but O is forbidden
- CESUM – not a word
- DEXES – not valid
- FLESH – H is allowed, but E is in position 2, so F L E S H → positions: F(1), L(3), E(2), S(4), H(5) – but S must be in 5, so this is invalid
- GLEES – S in 5, but E in 4 and 2, and S in 5, but also S in 4 – but S must be only in 5
- HELMS – H E L M S – positions: H(1), E(2), L(3), M(4), S(5) – all letters allowed, valid word
- JEWEL – but E in 2, S must be in 5, so J E W E L – but E is in 2 and 4, and L in 5 – but S must be in 5, so invalid
- KEEPS – P is forbidden
- LEVES – not a word
- MELTS – T is forbidden
- ULEMS – not a word
- WELSH – H is allowed, but positions: W(1), E(2), L(3), S(4), H(5) – but S must be in 5, so invalid
- YELPS – P is forbidden
- ZEEMS – Z E E M S – positions: Z(1), E(2), E(3), M(4), S(5) – but E is already in 2, and we don’t know if there are two E’s; also M is allowed, but this is speculative

The most straightforward valid word that fits is HELMS:
- H E L M S – positions: H(1), E(2), L(3), M(4), S(5)
- All letters are allowed (H, E, L, M, S)
- E is in position 2 (✓)

- No forbidden letters

Therefore, the next guess is HELMS.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically contain frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains:
- S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes both S and E.
2. Does NOT include A, R, or O.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Possible candidates:
- ""STEIN"" (S in 1, E in 2) – but contains I and N, which are untested.
- ""SLEEP"" – but has two E’s and P, which may be risky.
- ""STEEP"" – two E’s again.
- ""SHEET"" – two E’s and T.
- ""SEINE"" – S in 1, E in 2, I, N, E in 5 – but E is in position 5 which was wrong for AROSE.
- ""STILE"" – S in 1, E in 5 – again E in 5 is wrong.
- ""SINEC"" – not a valid word.
- ""SLEET"" – S in 1, E in 2, T, E in 4 – E in 4 is new, but we already know E is in the word but not in position 5.
- ""SWEET"" – S in 1, E in 2 and 4, T – but two E’s.
- ""STOLE"" – S in 1, E in 5 – again E in 5 is wrong.
- ""STEIN"" – S in 1, E in 2, I, N – valid word, no A/R/O, S not in 4, E not in 5.

""STEIN"" seems like a good next guess because it places S in position 1 and E in position 2, tests new letters I and N, and avoids the eliminated A, R, O.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words typically contain frequently used vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word contains:
- S and E, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes both S and E.
2. Does NOT include A, R, or O.
3. Places S somewhere other than position 4 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Possible candidates:
- ""STEIN"" (S in 1, E in 2) – but contains I and N, which are untested.
- ""SLEEP"" – but has two E’s and P, which may be risky.
- ""STEEP"" – two E’s again.
- ""SHEET"" – two E’s and T.
- ""SEINE"" – S in 1, E in 2, I, N, E in 5 – but E is in position 5 which was wrong for AROSE.
- ""STILE"" – S in 1, E in 5 – again E in 5 is wrong.
- ""SINEC"" – not a valid word.
- ""SLEET"" – S in 1, E in 2, T, E in 4 – E in 4 is new, but we already know E is in the word but not in position 5.
- ""SWEET"" – S in 1, E in 2 and 4, T – but two E’s.
- ""STOLE"" – S in 1, E in 5 – again E in 5 is wrong.
- ""STEIN"" – S in 1, E in 2, I, N – valid word, no A/R/O, S not in 4, E not in 5.

""STEIN"" seems like a good next guess because it places S in position 1 and E in position 2, tests new letters I and N, and avoids the eliminated A, R, O.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N  
Letters that ARE in the word but still unknown positions: S, E  

Specific positional exclusions so far:
- S cannot be in position 1 (from STEIN) or position 4 (from AROSE).
- E cannot be in position 2 (from STEIN) or position 5 (from AROSE).

So the secret word:
- Contains both S and E.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, T, I, N.
- S must be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- E must be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Valid consonants left to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels left to test: U (since A, O, E are partially known).

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S and E in allowed positions.
2. Uses only uneliminated letters.
3. Tests new letters to narrow the field.

Candidate words:
- ""SLEEK"" – uses S and E, but E is in position 2 (forbidden), and K is new.
- ""SHELF"" – S in 1 (forbidden), H, E in 2 (forbidden), L, F.
- ""SWEET"" – S in 1 (forbidden), W, E in 2 (forbidden), E in 4, T (forbidden).
- ""SEEPS"" – E in 1, S in 2, E in 3, P, S in 5. This uses S in 2 and 5 (allowed), E in 1 and 3 (allowed), and tests P.
- ""SLEEP"" – S in 1 (forbidden), L, E in 2 (forbidden), E in 4, P.

- ""SEWED"" – S in 1 (forbidden), E in 2 (forbidden), W, E in 4, D.
- ""SUEDE"" – S in 1 (forbidden), U, E in 3, D, E in 5 (forbidden).

""SEEPS"" looks promising: S in 2 and 5, E in 1 and 3, and tests P. All letters are uneliminated except S and E which we know must be present.

- Allowed letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to fill positions 1, 3, 4 with letters from the remaining set, and ensure the word is valid.

- E in 2, S in 5
- Position 1: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Position 3: same set
- Position 4: same set

Let’s list valid words:
- BESOM – but O is forbidden
- CESUM – not a word
- DEXES – not valid
- FLESH – H is allowed, but E is in position 2, so F L E S H → positions: F(1), L(3), E(2), S(4), H(5) – but S must be in 5, so this is invalid

- HELMS – H E L M S – positions: H(1), E(2), L(3), M(4), S(5) – all letters allowed, valid word
- JEWEL – but E in 2, S must be in 5, so J E W E L – but E is in 2 and 4, and L in 5 – but S must be in 5, so invalid
- KEEPS – P is forbidden
- LEVES – not a word
- MELTS – T is forbidden
- ULEMS – not a word
- WELSH – H is allowed, but positions: W(1), E(2), L(3), S(4), H(5) – but S must be in 5, so invalid
- YELPS – P is forbidden
- ZEEMS – Z E E M S – positions: Z(1), E(2), E(3), M(4), S(5) – but E is already in 2, and we don’t know if there are two E’s; also M is allowed, but this is speculative

The most straightforward valid word that fits is HELMS:
- H E L M S – positions: H(1), E(2), L(3), M(4), S(5)
- All letters are allowed (H, E, L, M, S)
- E is in position 2 (✓)
