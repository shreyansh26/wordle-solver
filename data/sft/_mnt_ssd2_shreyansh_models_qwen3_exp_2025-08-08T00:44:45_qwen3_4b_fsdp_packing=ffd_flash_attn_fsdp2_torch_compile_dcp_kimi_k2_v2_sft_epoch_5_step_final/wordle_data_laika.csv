### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps maximize the chances of getting hits (either correct position or wrong position) regardless of the secret word.

Common letters in English include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. A good first guess should contain several of these common letters without repeating any letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us 3 vowels and 2 consonants, all very common letters, which should provide good feedback regardless of the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → L is somewhere other than position 2
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → A is somewhere other than position 3
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: S, T, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: L, A
- Positions ruled out: L not in position 2, A not in position 3

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both L and A
- Does not contain S, T, E
- Has L not in position 2
- Has A not in position 3

Let’s think of possible placements:
- L could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- A could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5

Good consonants to try now (since S, T, E are out): R, N, D, C, M, P, etc.

A strong next guess would be one that places L and A in new positions and introduces new common letters. “CLAMP” is a good candidate:
- Contains L and A
- New letters C, M, P
- L is in position 2 (but we know L is not in position 2 from feedback) → so CLAMP is invalid.

Next try: “FLANK”
- Contains L and A
- New letters F, N, K
- L is in position 4 (valid, since position 2 is ruled out)
- A is in position 3 (invalid, since position 3 is ruled out)

Next try: “BLANK”
- Contains L and A
- New letters B, N, K
- L is in position 3 (valid)
- A is in position 4 (valid)

This seems like a good next guess.

This helps maximize the chances of getting hits (either correct position or wrong position) regardless of the secret word.

Common letters in English include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. A good first guess should contain several of these common letters without repeating any letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us 3 vowels and 2 consonants, all very common letters, which should provide good feedback regardless of the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → L is somewhere other than position 2
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → A is somewhere other than position 3
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: S, T, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: L, A
- Positions ruled out: L not in position 2, A not in position 3

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both L and A
- Does not contain S, T, E
- Has L not in position 2
- Has A not in position 3

Let’s think of possible placements:
- L could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- A could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5

Good consonants to try now (since S, T, E are out): R, N, D, C, M, P, etc.

A strong next guess would be one that places L and A in new positions and introduces new common letters. “CLAMP” is a good candidate:
- Contains L and A
- New letters C, M, P
- L is in position 2 (but we know L is not in position 2 from feedback) → so CLAMP is invalid.

Next try: “FLANK”
- Contains L and A
- New letters F, N, K
- L is in position 4 (valid, since position 2 is ruled out)
- A is in position 3 (invalid, since position 3 is ruled out)

Next try: “BLANK”
- Contains L and A
- New letters B, N, K
- L is in position 3 (valid)
- A is in position 4 (valid)

This seems like a good next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: BLANK -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) K(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   – Letters ruled out: S, T, E
   – Letters in the word but misplaced: L, A
   – L cannot be in position 2
   – A cannot be in position 3

2. BLANK → B(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) K(-)
   – Letters ruled out: B, N
   – Letters in the word but misplaced: L, A, K
   – L cannot be in position 2 (already known)
   – A cannot be in position 3 (already known)
   – K is in the word but not in position 5

So we now know:
- The word contains {L, A, K}
- The word does NOT contain {S, T, E, B, N}
- L is not in positions 2 or 2 (same)
- A is not in positions 3 or 3 (same)
- K is not in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains L, A, K
- Does not contain S, T, E, B, N
- L not in position 2
- A not in position 3
- K not in position 5

Good remaining consonants: R, D, C, M, P, F, G, H, etc.

Let’s try to place L, A, K in valid positions and fill the rest with new letters.

Possible positions:
- L: 1, 3, 4, 5
- A: 1, 2, 4, 5
- K: 1, 2, 3, 4

Let’s pick a word that places these letters in new valid spots and introduces new common letters.

Consider “CLARK”:
- Letters: C, L, A, R, K
- Contains L, A, K
- No S, T, E, B, N
- L is in position 2 (invalid, ruled out)
So CLARK is invalid.

Consider “FLACK”:
- Letters: F, L, A, C, K
- L in position 2 (invalid)
Invalid.

Consider “PLANK”:
- Already tried, N is out.

Consider “GLARK”:
- Not a valid word.

Consider “CRACK”:
- Contains C, R, A, C, K
- Contains A, K
- No L (need L)
Invalid.

Consider “CLARK” again – invalid due to L in 2.

Consider “LARKY”:
- Contains L, A, K
- Y is new
- L in position 1 (valid)
- A in position 2 (valid)
- K in position 4 (valid)
- No banned letters
- Valid word

So “LARKY” is a valid next guess.

From the new feedback on LARKY:
- L(✓) – L is correct in position 1
- A(✓) – A is correct in position 2
- R(x) – R is not in the word
- K(✓) – K is correct in position 4
- Y(x) – Y is not in the word

So the pattern so far is:
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: K
- Position 5: ?

Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, T, E, B, N, R, Y  
Letters we know are in the word: L, A, K (and we already placed them correctly)

We need to fill positions 3 and 5 with letters that:
- Have not been ruled out
- Are common English letters

Remaining consonants to try: C, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, etc.

Common 5-letter words that fit L A _ K _:
- LACKS – but S is ruled out
- LAKES – E and S ruled out
- LAMPS – M, P, S (S ruled out)
- LARKS – R and S ruled out
- LAKES – E ruled out
- LACKS – S ruled out
- LAKED – D
- LAKES – E ruled out
- LAKES – E ruled out
- LAKED – D

""LAKED"" seems valid:
- Letters: L, A, K, E, D
- E is ruled out (from SLATE feedback), so invalid.

Next candidate: ""LAMPS"" – S ruled out.

""LAPSE"" – S and E ruled out.

""LAPID"" – P, I, D not ruled out.

""LAPID"" fits:
- L A P I D
- P, I, D are not in the banned list
- Positions: L(✓) A(✓) P ? I ? D
- This seems valid.

But we need to check if P and I are allowed. Since they haven't been ruled out, this is acceptable.

Another candidate: ""LAMPS"" – S ruled out.

""LAPSE"" – S, E ruled out.

""LAKED"" – E ruled out.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps maximize the chances of getting hits (either correct position or wrong position) regardless of the secret word.

Common letters in English include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. A good first guess should contain several of these common letters without repeating any letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us 3 vowels and 2 consonants, all very common letters, which should provide good feedback regardless of the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → L is somewhere other than position 2
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → A is somewhere other than position 3
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: S, T, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: L, A
- Positions ruled out: L not in position 2, A not in position 3

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both L and A
- Does not contain S, T, E
- Has L not in position 2
- Has A not in position 3

Let’s think of possible placements:
- L could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- A could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5

Good consonants to try now (since S, T, E are out): R, N, D, C, M, P, etc.

A strong next guess would be one that places L and A in new positions and introduces new common letters. “CLAMP” is a good candidate:
- Contains L and A
- New letters C, M, P
- L is in position 2 (but we know L is not in position 2 from feedback) → so CLAMP is invalid.

Next try: “FLANK”
- Contains L and A
- New letters F, N, K
- L is in position 4 (valid, since position 2 is ruled out)
- A is in position 3 (invalid, since position 3 is ruled out)

Next try: “BLANK”
- Contains L and A
- New letters B, N, K
- L is in position 3 (valid)
- A is in position 4 (valid)

This seems like a good next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: BLANK -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) K(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   – Letters ruled out: S, T, E
   – Letters in the word but misplaced: L, A
   – L cannot be in position 2
   – A cannot be in position 3

2. BLANK → B(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) K(-)
   – Letters ruled out: B, N
   – Letters in the word but misplaced: L, A, K
   – L cannot be in position 2 (already known)
   – A cannot be in position 3 (already known)
   – K is in the word but not in position 5

So we now know:
- The word contains {L, A, K}
- The word does NOT contain {S, T, E, B, N}
- L is not in positions 2 or 2 (same)
- A is not in positions 3 or 3 (same)
- K is not in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains L, A, K
- Does not contain S, T, E, B, N
- L not in position 2
- A not in position 3
- K not in position 5

Good remaining consonants: R, D, C, M, P, F, G, H, etc.

Let’s try to place L, A, K in valid positions and fill the rest with new letters.

Possible positions:
- L: 1, 3, 4, 5
- A: 1, 2, 4, 5
- K: 1, 2, 3, 4

Let’s pick a word that places these letters in new valid spots and introduces new common letters.

Consider “CLARK”:
- Letters: C, L, A, R, K
- Contains L, A, K
- No S, T, E, B, N
- L is in position 2 (invalid, ruled out)
So CLARK is invalid.

Consider “FLACK”:
- Letters: F, L, A, C, K
- L in position 2 (invalid)
Invalid.

Consider “PLANK”:
- Already tried, N is out.

Consider “GLARK”:
- Not a valid word.

Consider “CRACK”:
- Contains C, R, A, C, K
- Contains A, K
- No L (need L)
Invalid.

Consider “CLARK” again – invalid due to L in 2.

Consider “LARKY”:
- Contains L, A, K
- Y is new
- L in position 1 (valid)
- A in position 2 (valid)
- K in position 4 (valid)
- No banned letters
- Valid word

So “LARKY” is a valid next guess.

A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps maximize the chances of getting hits (either correct position or wrong position) regardless of the secret word.\n\nCommon letters in English include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. A good first guess should contain several of these common letters without repeating any letters to maximize information gain.\n\nLooking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:\n- S (very common starting letter)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (most common vowel)\n- T (common consonant)\n- E (most common vowel)\n\nThis gives us 3 vowels and 2 consonants, all very common letters, which should provide good feedback regardless of the secret word.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n- S is NOT in the word (x)\n- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → L is somewhere other than position 2\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → A is somewhere other than position 3\n- T is NOT in the word (x)\n- E is NOT in the word (x)\n\nSo we know:\n- Letters to avoid: S, T, E\n- Letters that ARE in the word: L, A\n- Positions ruled out: L not in position 2, A not in position 3\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that:\n- Contains both L and A\n- Does not contain S, T, E\n- Has L not in position 2\n- Has A not in position 3\n\nLet’s think of possible placements:\n- L could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5\n- A could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5\n\nGood consonants to try now (since S, T, E are out): R, N, D, C, M, P, etc.\n\nA strong next guess would be one that places L and A in new positions and introduces new common letters. “CLAMP” is a good candidate:\n- Contains L and A\n- New letters C, M, P\n- L is in position 2 (but we know L is not in position 2 from feedback) → so CLAMP is invalid.\n\nNext try: “FLANK”\n- Contains L and A\n- New letters F, N, K\n- L is in position 4 (valid, since position 2 is ruled out)\n- A is in position 3 (invalid, since position 3 is ruled out)\n\nNext try: “BLANK”\n- Contains L and A\n- New letters B, N, K\n- L is in position 3 (valid)\n- A is in position 4 (valid)\n\nThis seems like a good next guess.\n\n<guess>BLANK</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: BLANK -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) K(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two rounds of feedback:\n\n1.

From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   – Letters not in the word: S, T, E
   – Letters in the word but misplaced: L, A

2. BLANK → B(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) K(-)
   – Letters not in the word: B, N
   – Additional letters in the word but misplaced: K

3. LARKY → L(✓) A(✓) R(x) K(✓) Y(x)
   – Letters in the correct positions:
     – L is fixed in position 1
     – A is fixed in position 2
     – K is fixed in position 4
   – Letters not in the word: R, Y

So the word has the form:
L A _ K _

And the missing letters (positions 3 and 5) must be chosen from the remaining unused letters that have not been ruled out.  
Letters already ruled out: S, T, E, B, N, R, Y.  
Remaining common letters include C, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word matching L A _ K _.

Possible candidates:
- LACKY – but Y is ruled out.
- LAMOK – but O is allowed, but “LAMOK” is not a standard word.
- LACKS – S is ruled out.
- LAKES – S, E are ruled out.
- LADOK – not a word.
- LAFIK – not a word.
- LAKES – already ruled out.
- LAKES – ruled out.
- LAKES – ruled out.
- LAKES – ruled out.

Looking at a dictionary, the valid word fitting L A _ K _ is:

L A C K _ – but we need a 5-letter word. The only common word is LACKS, but S is ruled out.

Next, L A F K _ – not a word.

L A G K _ – not a word.

L A H K _ – not a word.

L A I K _ – not a word.

L A M K _ – not a word.

L A P K _ – not a word.

L A U K _ – not a word.

L A V K _ – not a word.

L A W K _ – not a word.

L A Z K _ – not a word.

Wait, let’s re-examine the constraints:

We know:
- L is in position 1 (✓)
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- K is in position 4 (✓)
- Letters not in the word: S, T, E, B, N, R, Y
- Positions 3 and 5 must be filled with letters not in the forbidden set.

Looking at a dictionary, the only common 5-letter word that fits L A _ K _ and uses allowed letters is:

L A C K _ – but we need a 5-letter word. The word ""LACKS"" is invalid (S is out).

""LAKES"" is invalid (E, S out).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps maximize the chances of getting hits (either correct position or wrong position) regardless of the secret word.

Common letters in English include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. A good first guess should contain several of these common letters without repeating any letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us 3 vowels and 2 consonants, all very common letters, which should provide good feedback regardless of the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → L is somewhere other than position 2
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → A is somewhere other than position 3
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: S, T, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: L, A
- Positions ruled out: L not in position 2, A not in position 3

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both L and A
- Does not contain S, T, E
- Has L not in position 2
- Has A not in position 3

Let’s think of possible placements:
- L could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- A could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5

Good consonants to try now (since S, T, E are out): R, N, D, C, M, P, etc.

A strong next guess would be one that places L and A in new positions and introduces new common letters. “CLAMP” is a good candidate:
- Contains L and A
- New letters C, M, P
- L is in position 2 (but we know L is not in position 2 from feedback) → so CLAMP is invalid.

Next try: “FLANK”
- Contains L and A
- New letters F, N, K
- L is in position 4 (valid, since position 2 is ruled out)
- A is in position 3 (invalid, since position 3 is ruled out)

Next try: “BLANK”
- Contains L and A
- New letters B, N, K
- L is in position 3 (valid)
- A is in position 4 (valid)

This seems like a good next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: BLANK -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) K(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   – Letters ruled out: S, T, E
   – Letters in the word but misplaced: L, A
   – L cannot be in position 2
   – A cannot be in position 3

2. BLANK → B(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) K(-)
   – Letters ruled out: B, N
   – Letters in the word but misplaced: L, A, K
   – L cannot be in position 2 (already known)
   – A cannot be in position 3 (already known)
   – K is in the word but not in position 5

So we now know:
- The word contains {L, A, K}
- The word does NOT contain {S, T, E, B, N}
- L is not in positions 2 or 2 (same)
- A is not in positions 3 or 3 (same)
- K is not in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains L, A, K
- Does not contain S, T, E, B, N
- L not in position 2
- A not in position 3
- K not in position 5

Good remaining consonants: R, D, C, M, P, F, G, H, etc.

Let’s try to place L, A, K in valid positions and fill the rest with new letters.

Possible positions:
- L: 1, 3, 4, 5
- A: 1, 2, 4, 5
- K: 1, 2, 3, 4

Let’s pick a word that places these letters in new valid spots and introduces new common letters.

Consider “CLARK”:
- Letters: C, L, A, R, K
- Contains L, A, K
- No S, T, E, B, N
- L is in position 2 (invalid, ruled out)
So CLARK is invalid.

Consider “FLACK”:
- Letters: F, L, A, C, K
- L in position 2 (invalid)
Invalid.

Consider “PLANK”:
- Already tried, N is out.

Consider “GLARK”:
- Not a valid word.

Consider “CRACK”:
- Contains C, R, A, C, K
- Contains A, K
- No L (need L)
Invalid.

Consider “CLARK” again – invalid due to L in 2.

Consider “LARKY”:
- Contains L, A, K
- Y is new
- L in position 1 (valid)
- A in position 2 (valid)
- K in position 4 (valid)
- No banned letters
- Valid word

So “LARKY” is a valid next guess.

From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   – Letters NOT in the word: S, T, E
   – Letters in the word but misplaced: L, A

2. BLANK → B(x) L(-) A(-) N(x) K(-)
   – Letters NOT in the word: B, N
   – Letters in the word but misplaced: L, A, K

3. LARKY → L(✓) A(✓) R(x) K(✓) Y(x)
   – Correct positions: L in 1st, A in 2nd, K in 4th
   – Letters NOT in the word: R, Y
   – Letters already confirmed in the word: L, A, K

So the word looks like: L A _ K _

Letters already ruled out: S, T, E, B, N, R, Y

Remaining common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Z

We need a 5-letter word that starts with LA, ends with K, and has one letter in between that is not any of the ruled-out letters.

Possible pattern: L A ? K _

Let’s list valid English words fitting this pattern:

- LACKS – but S is ruled out
- LAKES – E is ruled out
- LAKED – D is allowed
- LAKES – E ruled out
- LAKED – D is allowed
- LAKES – E ruled out
- LAKED – D is allowed
- LAKES – E ruled out
- LAKED – D is allowed

“LAKED” is a valid word (past tense of lake). It uses D, which hasn’t been ruled out.

So the next logical guess is LAKED.
