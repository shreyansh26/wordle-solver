- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a popular choice as it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another strong contender is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) or ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more balanced in terms of letter frequency.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters ruled out entirely (x in every position they appeared):  
A, R, O, S, U, T, W, D.

Letters confirmed in the word:
- I: appeared in position 4 in guess 2, but received “-” (wrong position).  
  So I is in the word, but not in position 4.
- E: appeared in position 5 in guess 1 (“-”), position 2 in guess 2 (“-”), position 3 in guess 3 (“✓”).  
  Therefore E is in the word and is in position 3.

Letters whose status is still ambiguous (have appeared but not yet marked ✓ or –):
- N: appeared in guess 2 (position 2) and got “-”, so N is in the word but not in position 2.
- L: appeared in guess 3 (position 4) and got “-”, so L is in the word but not in position 4.

So the word must be:
- 5 letters long.
- E is in position 3.
- I is in the word but not in position 4.
- N is in the word but not in position 2.
- L is in the word but not in position 4.
- No letters from {A, R, O, S, U, T, W, D} may appear.

Possible positions for the remaining letters:
- Position 1: any unused letter (must be one of the still-possible ones).
- Position 2: must be N or I or L (but N cannot be here, L cannot be here, I cannot be here because I is not in position 4 and we haven’t ruled out positions 1, 2, or 5 for I yet).
- Position 4: must be I or N or L (but I cannot be here, N cannot be here, L cannot be here), so this position must be one of the remaining letters.
- Position 5: any unused letter.

Let’s list the still-possible letters:  
B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, Y, N, I, L, E (E is already placed), etc.

We know:
- Position 3 = E.
- We need to place I, N, L in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, with the constraints above.

Let’s try to construct a word:

Option 1: N in position 1, L in position 2, I in position 5  
  Word: N L _ E I → but position 2 cannot be L (from guess 3 feedback), so invalid.

Option 2: I in position 1, N in position 2, L in position 5  
  Word: I N _ E L → but position 2 cannot be N (from guess 2 feedback), so invalid.

Option 3: I in position 1, L in position 2, N in position 5  
  Word: I L _ E N → position 2 cannot be L (from guess 3 feedback), so invalid.

Option 4: N in position 1, I in position 2, L in position 5  
  Word: N I _ E L → position 2 cannot be I (we haven’t ruled it out, but we need to check if this violates any constraint).  
  Actually, I can be in position 2 because the only restriction is that I is not in position 4.  
  This seems valid.  
  Now we need a letter for position 3, but position 3 is already E.  
  So word: N I _ E L → we need a letter for position 4.  
  The only remaining letters are from {B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, Y}.  
  Let’s pick a common one, say M: N I M E L → “NIMEL” is not a valid English word.  
  Next, K: N I K E L → “NIKEL” is not valid.  
  Next, P: N I P E L → “NIPEL” is not valid.  
  Next, B: N I B E L → “NIBEL” is not valid.  
  Next, H: N I H E L → “NIHEL” is not valid.  
  Next, C: N I C E L → “NICEL” is not valid.  
  Next, F: N I F E L → “NIFEL” is not valid.  
  Next, G: N I G E L → “NIGEL” is not valid.  
  Next, V: N I V E L → “NIVEL” is not valid.  
  Next, Y: N I Y E L → “NIYEL” is not valid.  
  None of these seem valid.  

Option 5: L in position 1, N in position 2, I in position 5  
  Word: L N _ E I → position 2 cannot be N (from guess 2 feedback), so invalid.

Option 6: L in position 1, I in position 2, N in position 5  
  Word: L I _ E N → position 2 can be I.  
  Need a letter for position 3, but position 3 is E.  
  So word: L I _ E N → need a letter for position 4.  
  Possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, Y.  
  Try M: L I M E N → “LIMEN” is valid (a biological term).  
  Check constraints:
  - Letters: L, I, M, E, N – none are from the ruled-out set.  
  - E is in position 3 (correct).  
  - I is in position 2 (not 4, so ok).  
  - N is in position 5 (not 2, so ok).  
  - L is in position 1 (not 4, so ok).  
  This seems to satisfy all constraints.

Let me verify:  
- “LIMEN” is a valid 5-letter word.  
- It uses only allowed letters.  
- It satisfies the positional constraints based on feedback.

Therefore, the next guess is “LIMEN”.

- N is in the word but not in position 2.
- L is in the word but not in position 4.

Let’s list the still-possible letters:  
B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, Y, N, I, L, E (E is already placed), etc.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a popular choice as it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another strong contender is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) or ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's slightly more balanced in terms of letter frequency.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).  
That means the secret word contains E, but it is not in the 5th position.

Letters we now know are out: A, R, O, S  
Letters we know are in: E (but not in position 5)

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E (but not as the last letter).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

Good remaining common letters: T, I, N, L, C, D, U, M, P, H, Y, B, G, K, F, W, V, X, Z, J, Q.

Let’s pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters while avoiding the eliminated ones.  
A good candidate is “UNTIE”:
- Letters: U, N, T, I, E (none of A, R, O, S appear).
- E is in position 4 (not 5), satisfying the feedback.

Other possibilities: “UNTIE”, “UNTIE”, “UNTIE” … “UNTIE” is fine.

<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – E is in the word but not in position 5.  
   – A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all.

2. untie → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(✓) E(-)  
   – I is in the word AND in the correct position (4).  
   – E is in the word but not in position 5 (consistent with round 1) and also not in position 2.  
   – U and T are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: I (position 4), E (somewhere else).  
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, T.

Remaining common letters to test: N, L, C, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, F, W, V, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 4.  
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1-3 or 5 (but not 2).  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Candidate structure: _ _ _ I _ with E in one of positions 1, 3, or 5.

Let’s pick a word that tests new common letters while fitting these constraints.  
“PELIC” is invalid (not a real word).  
“FELIN” is invalid.  
“WIELD” – W, E, L, D are all still possible, and I is in position 4.  
Check letters: W, E, L, I, D – none are A, R, O, S, U, T.  
And E is in position 2 (allowed).

So “WIELD” is a valid next guess.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters ruled out entirely (x in every position they appeared):  
A, R, O, S, U, T, W, D.

Letters confirmed in the word:
- I: appeared in position 4 in guess 2, but received “-” (wrong position).  
  So I is in the word, but not in position 4.
- E: appeared in position 5 in guess 1 (“-”), position 2 in guess 2 (“-”), position 3 in guess 3 (“✓”).  
  Therefore E is in the word and is in position 3.

Letters whose status is still ambiguous (have appeared but not yet marked ✓ or –):
- N: appeared in guess 2 (position 2) and got “-”, so N is in the word but not in position 2.
- L: appeared in guess 3 (position 4) and got “-”, so L is in the word but not in position 4.

So the word must be:
- 5 letters long.
- E is in position 3.
- I is in the word but not in position 4.
- N is in the word but not in position 2.
- L is in the word but not in position 4.
- No letters from {A, R, O, S, U, T, W, D} may appear.

Possible positions for the remaining letters:
- Position 1: any unused letter (must be one of the still-possible ones).
- Position 2: must be N or I or L (but N cannot be here, L cannot be here, I cannot be here because I is not in position 4 and we haven’t ruled out positions 1, 2, or 5 for I yet).
- Position 4: must be I or N or L (but I cannot be here, N cannot be here, L cannot be here), so this position must be one of the remaining letters.
- Position 5: any unused letter.

Let’s list the still-possible letters:  
B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, Y, N, I, L, E (E is already placed), etc.

We know:
- Position 3 = E.
- We need to place I, N, L in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, with the constraints above.

Let’s try to construct a word:

Option 1: N in position 1, L in position 2, I in position 5  
  Word: N L _ E I → but position 2 cannot be L (from guess 3 feedback), so invalid.

Option 2: I in position 1, N in position 2, L in position 5  
  Word: I N _ E L → but position 2 cannot be N (from guess 2 feedback), so invalid.

Option 3: I in position 1, L in position 2, N in position 5  
  Word: I L _ E N → position 2 cannot be L (from guess 3 feedback), so invalid.

Option 4: N in position 1, I in position 2, L in position 5  
  Word: N I _ E L → position 2 cannot be I (we haven’t ruled it out, but we need to check if this violates any constraint).  
  Actually, I can be in position 2 because the only restriction is that I is not in position 4.  
  This seems valid.  
  Now we need a letter for position 3, but position 3 is already E.  
  So word: N I _ E L → we need a letter for position 4.  
  The only remaining letters are from {B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, Y}.  
  Let’s pick a common one, say M: N I M E L → “NIMEL” is not a valid English word.  
  Next, K: N I K E L → “NIKEL” is not valid.  
  Next, P: N I P E L → “NIPEL” is not valid.  
  Next, B: N I B E L → “NIBEL” is not valid.  
  Next, H: N I H E L → “NIHEL” is not valid.  
  Next, C: N I C E L → “NICEL” is not valid.  
  Next, F: N I F E L → “NIFEL” is not valid.  
  Next, G: N I G E L → “NIGEL” is not valid.  
  Next, V: N I V E L → “NIVEL” is not valid.  
  Next, Y: N I Y E L → “NIYEL” is not valid.  
  None of these seem valid.  

Option 5: L in position 1, N in position 2, I in position 5  
  Word: L N _ E I → position 2 cannot be N (from guess 2 feedback), so invalid.

Option 6: L in position 1, I in position 2, N in position 5  
  Word: L I _ E N → position 2 can be I.  
  Need a letter for position 3, but position 3 is E.  
  So word: L I _ E N → need a letter for position 4.  
  Possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, Y.  
  Try M: L I M E N → “LIMEN” is valid (a biological term).  
  Check constraints:
  - Letters: L, I, M, E, N – none are from the ruled-out set.  
  - E is in position 3 (correct).  
  - I is in position 2 (not 4, so ok).  
  - N is in position 5 (not 2, so ok).  
  - L is in position 1 (not 4, so ok).  
  This seems to satisfy all constraints.

Let me verify:  
- “LIMEN” is a valid 5-letter word.  
- It uses only allowed letters.  
- It satisfies the positional constraints based on feedback.

Therefore, the next guess is “LIMEN”.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after four guesses.

Ruled-out letters (x in every position they appeared):  
A, R, O, S, U, T, W, D, M.

Confirmed letters and their positions:
- E is in position 3 (✓ in guess 3).  
- N is in position 5 (✓ in guess 4).

Letters whose status is still “in word but wrong position”:
- I: appeared in positions 2 (guess 2), 4 (guess 3), 2 (guess 4) and got “-” every time.  
  Therefore I is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4.  
  Possible positions for I: 1 or 5.  
  But position 5 is already N, so I must be in position 1.

- L: appeared in positions 1 (guess 4) and 4 (guess 3) and got “-” both times.  
  Therefore L is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 4.  
  Possible positions for L: 2 or 5.  
  Position 5 is N, so L must be in position 2.

So the word skeleton is now:
Position 1: I  
Position 2: L  
Position 3: E  
Position 4: ?  
Position 5: N  

We need a letter for position 4 that:
- Has not been ruled out (not in {A, R, O, S, U, T, W, D, M}).  
- Has not been used yet.  

Still-possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, P, V, Y.

Let’s pick a common one.  
Try B: I L E B N → “ILEBN” – not a word.  
Try C: I L E C N → “ILECN” – not a word.  
Try F: I L E F N → “ILEFN” – not a word.  
Try G: I L E G N → “ILEGN” – not a word.  
Try H: I L E H N → “ILEHN” – not a word.  
Try K: I L E K N → “ILEKN” – not a word.  
Try P: I L E P N → “ILEPN” – not a word.  
Try V: I L E V N → “ILEVN” – not a word.  
Try Y: I L E Y N → “ILEYN” – not a word.  

None of these are valid English words.  
Let’s re-examine the skeleton:  
I L E _ N  

Wait, we may have missed a letter.  
Looking back at the still-possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, P, V, Y.  
None of these seem to form a valid word with I L E _ N.  

Let me re-check the constraints carefully.  
We have:
- Position 1: I  
- Position 2: L  
- Position 3: E  
- Position 5: N  

So the word must be I L E ? N.  

The only valid English word that fits this pattern is “ILEAN” (a Scottish word for “to make a hill”), but it’s obscure.  
Another possibility: “ILEMN” – invalid.  

Wait, let’s check “ILEAN” again – it is listed in some dictionaries as a variant of “ileach” or “ilean” (meaning “to make a hill”).  
However, in standard Scrabble/Wordle dictionaries, “ILEAN” is not accepted.  

Let me reconsider: perhaps I made an error in assuming L must be in position 2.  
Re-examine L’s feedback:  
- Guess 4: L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 1.  
- Guess 3: L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 4.  
Therefore L cannot be in positions 1 or 4, so L must be in position 2 or 3 or 5.  
Position 3 is E, position 5 is N, so L must be in position 2.  

Thus the skeleton is indeed I L E _ N.  

The only remaining letter that can form a valid word is “ILEAN”, but it’s not standard.  
Wait, let’s check if “ILEMN” is a word – no.  

Let me re-examine the still-possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, P, V, Y.  
None of these form a valid word with I L E _ N.  

Hmm, this suggests I may have missed a letter.  
Re-check the ruled-out letters:  
A, R, O, S, U, T, W, D, M.  

Still-possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, P, V, Y, N, I, L, E.  

But N and I and L and E are already placed.  

Therefore the only possible letter for position 4 is one of B, C, F, G, H, K, P, V, Y.  

Let me list all 5-letter words matching I L E ? N:  
- ILEBN – no  
- ILECN – no  
- ILEFN – no  
- ILEGN – no  
- ILEHN – no  
- ILEKN – no  
- ILEPN – no  
- ILEVN – no  
- ILEYN – no  

None of these are valid.  

This implies I must have made an error earlier.  
Let me re-examine the feedback for guess 4: limen  
L(-) I(-) M(x) E(-) N(✓)  

This means:
- L is in the word but not in position 1.  
- I is in the word but not in position 2.  
- M is not in the word.  
- E is in the word but not in position 4 (but we already know E is in position 3).  
- N is in the word and is in position 5.  

So the word must be:  
- Position 3: E  
- Position 5: N  
- I must be in position 1 or 4 (since it cannot be in 2 or 4? Wait:  
  In guess 2: I was in position 4 and got ✓, so I is in position 4.  
  But in guess 3: I was in position 4 and got -, so this is a contradiction.  

Wait, this is critical:  
Guess 2: untie → I(✓) at position 4.  
Guess 3: wield → I(-) at position 4.  

This is impossible – the same letter cannot be ✓ and then - in the same position.  

This means I must have misread the feedback.  
Re-reading guess 2 and 3 carefully:  

Guess 2: untie → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(✓) E(-)  
  – I is in the word and in position 4 (✓).  

Guess 3: wield → W(x) I(-) E(✓) L(-) D(x)  
  – I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).  

This is a contradiction – I cannot simultaneously be in position 4 and not in position 4.  

This implies I made an error in interpreting the feedback.  
Let me re-express the feedback correctly:  

Guess 2: untie → positions: U(1) N(2) T(3) I(4) E(5)  
Feedback: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(✓) E(-)  
- U, T, E are not in the word (x).  
- N is in the word but not in position 2 (-).  
- I is in the word and in position 4 (✓).  

Guess 3: wield → positions: W(1) I(2) E(3) L(4) D(5)  
Feedback: W(x) I(-) E(✓) L(-) D(x)  
- W, D are not in the word (x).  
- I is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).  
- E is in the word and in position 3 (✓).  
- L is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).  

So now we have:
- I is in position 4 (from guess 2).  
- E is in position 3 (from guess 3).  
- N is in the word but not in position 2 (from guess 2).  
- L is in the word but not in position 4 (from guess 3).  

This resolves the contradiction.  

Therefore the word skeleton is:
- Position 3: E  
- Position 4: I  
- Position 5: N (from guess 4)  
- N is in the word but not in position 2 (so N must be in position 5).  

So the word must be _ _ E I N.  

Letters still to place: positions 1 and 2.  
Letters not yet ruled out: B, C, F, G, H, K, P, V, Y, N, I, L, E.  

But N is already in position 5, I in 4, E in 3.  

We also know:
- L is in the word but not in position 4 (already satisfied).  
- N is in position 5 (already satisfied).  

So we need a letter for position 1 and 2 from the still-possible set, avoiding ruled-out letters.  

Possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, P, V, Y, L.  

Let’s look for valid 5-letter words ending in EIN:  
- B, C, F, G, H, K, P, V, Y, L.  

The word must be _ _ E I N.  

Possible candidates:
- BLEIN – no  
- CLEIN – no  
- FLEIN – no  
- GLEIN – no  
- HEIN – no  
- KLEIN – no  
- PLEIN – no  
- VLEIN – no  
-YLEIN – no  
- L _ E I N – no  

This suggests I may have missed a letter.  

Re-examine the still-possible letters:  
We have not yet ruled out: B, C, F, G, H, K, P, V, Y, L.  

The word must be _ _ E I N with L somewhere.  

Let’s list all valid 5-letter words ending in EIN:  
- PLEIN – valid (French-derived word for “open”).  
- BLEIN – not valid.  
- FLEIN – not valid.  
- CLEIN – not valid.  
- GLEIN – not valid.  
- HEIN – not valid.  
- KLEIN – not valid.  
- VLEIN – not valid.  
-YLEIN – not valid.  

So the only valid word is PLEIN.  

Check constraints:
- P, L, E, I, N – none are ruled out.  
- E is in position 3 (✓).  
- I is in position 4 (✓).  
- N is in position 5 (✓).  
- L is in position 2 (not 4, so ok).  

This satisfies all feedback.

Guess 2: untie → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(✓) E(-)  
  – I is in the word and in position 4 (✓).  

Guess 3: wield → W(x) I(-) E(✓) L(-) D(x)  
  – I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).  

This is a contradiction – I cannot simultaneously be in position 4 and not in position 4.  

This implies I made an error in interpreting the feedback.  
Let me re-express the feedback correctly:  

Guess 2: untie → positions: U(1) N(2) T(3) I(4) E(5)  
Feedback: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(✓) E(-)  
- U, T, E are not in the word (x).  
- N is in the word but not in position 2 (-).  
- I is in the word and in position 4 (✓).  

Guess 3: wield → positions: W(1) I(2) E(3) L(4) D(5)  
Feedback: W(x) I(-) E(✓) L(-) D(x)  
- W, D are not in the word (x).  
- I is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).  
- E is in the word and in position 3 (✓).  
- L is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).  

So now we have:
- I is in position 4 (from guess 2).  
- E is in position 3 (from guess 3).  
- N is in the word but not in position 2 (from guess 2).  
- L is in the word but not in position 4 (from guess 3).  

This resolves the contradiction.  

Therefore the word skeleton is:
- Position 3: E  
- Position 4: I  
- Position 5: N (from guess 4)  
- N is in the word but not in position 2 (so N must be in position 5).  

So the word must be _ _ E I N.  

Letters still to place: positions 1 and 2.  
Letters not yet ruled out: B, C, F, G, H, K, P, V, Y, N, I, L, E.  

But N is already in position 5, I in 4, E in 3.  

We also know:
- L is in the word but not in position 4 (already satisfied).  
- N is in position 5 (already satisfied).  

So we need a letter for position 1 and 2 from the still-possible set, avoiding ruled-out letters.  

Possible letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, P, V, Y, L.  

Let’s look for valid 5-letter words ending in EIN:  
- B, C, F, G, H, K, P, V, Y, L.  

The word must be _ _ E I N.  

Possible candidates:
- BLEIN – no  
- CLEIN – no  
- FLEIN – no  
- GLEIN – no  
- HEIN – no  
- KLEIN – no  
- PLEIN – no  
- VLEIN – no  
-YLEIN – no  
- L _ E I N – no  

This suggests I may have missed a letter.  

Re-examine the still-possible letters:  
We have not yet ruled out: B, C, F, G, H, K, P, V, Y, L.  

The word must be _ _ E I N with L somewhere.  

Let’s list all valid 5-letter words ending in EIN:  
- PLEIN – valid (French-derived word for “open”).  
- BLEIN – not valid.  
- FLEIN – not valid.  
- CLEIN – not valid.  
- GLEIN – not valid.  
- HEIN – not valid.  
- KLEIN – not valid.  
- VLEIN – not valid.  
-YLEIN – not valid.  

So the only valid word is PLEIN.  

Check constraints:
- P, L, E, I, N – none are ruled out.  
- E is in position 3 (✓).  
- I is in position 4 (✓).  
- N is in position 5 (✓).  
- L is in position 2 (not 4, so ok).  

This satisfies all feedback.",Guess 5: plein -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) L(✓) E(✓) I(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
