For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a broad range of vowels and consonants. This helps gather maximum information about the secret word. A good starting word should have:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize letter coverage

Popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common)
- E (most common vowel)

So we know:

- Letters definitely IN the word: A, S, L  
- Positions ruled out for each:
  – A cannot be in position 3 (from CRANE) or 3 (from SLAID) – still position 3 is ruled out.  
  – S cannot be in position 1 (from SLAID).  
  – L cannot be in position 2 (from SLAID).

- Contains A, S, L exactly once each.  
- Does NOT contain C, R, N, E, I, D.  
- Places A somewhere other than position 3.  
- Places S somewhere other than position 1.  
- Places L somewhere other than position 2.

Remaining common letters to try: T, O, U, M, P, Y, B, G, H, K, etc.

A good candidate is “PLATO”:
- P, T, O are new consonants/vowels.  
- Contains A, S, L (but wait, PLATO doesn’t have S or L).

A better candidate is “STALK”:
- S, T, A, L, K.

Next try “PLAUS”:

Remaining common letters to try: T, O, U, M, P, Y, B, G, H, K, etc.

A good candidate is “PLATO”:
- P, T, O are new consonants/vowels.  
- Contains A, S, L (but wait, PLATO doesn’t have S or L).  
Let me rethink.

A better candidate is “STALK”:
- S, T, A, L, K.  
- Contains S, A, L.  
- S is in position 1 – but we know S cannot be in position 1. So STALK is invalid.

Next try “SLUMP”:
- S, L, U, M, P.  
- Contains S and L, but not A – violates requirement.

Next try “PLAUS”:
- P, L, A, U, S.  
- Contains A, S, L.  
- S is in position 5 (allowed).  
- L is in position 2 (but we know L cannot be in position 2). So PLAUS is invalid.

Next try “PLASM”:
- P, L, A, S, M.  
- Contains A, S, L.  
- S is in position 4 (allowed).  
- L is in position 2 (still invalid).

Next try “LAPSE”:
- L, A, P, S, E.  
- Contains A, S, L.  
- E is ruled out. So LAPSE is invalid.

Next try “LASHY”:
- L, A, S, H, Y.  
- Contains A, S, L.  
- L is in position 1 (allowed).  
- S is in position 3 (allowed).  
- A is in position 2 (allowed).  
- No forbidden letters.

So LASHY satisfies all constraints.

From all feedback so far:

Letters confirmed IN the word: A (position 2), S, L, Y  
Letters confirmed OUT: C, R, N, E, I, D, H  

Positions ruled out:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2 (already fixed at 2), 3, 4, 5 → A must be in position 2 (already known).
- S cannot be in positions 1, 3, 5 (from SLAID and LASHY) → S must be in position 2 or 4, but position 2 is A → S must be in position 4.
- L cannot be in positions 1, 2, 5 (from SLAID and LASHY) → L must be in position 3.
- Y cannot be in positions 4, 5 (from LASHY) → Y must be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 is L → Y must be in position 1.

So far we have:
Y (1), A (2), L (3), S (4), and one more letter for position 5.  
The only letters still allowed are those not yet ruled out: B, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a broad range of vowels and consonants. This helps gather maximum information about the secret word. A good starting word should have:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize letter coverage

Popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common)
- E (most common vowel)

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, N, E.
- DOES contain A, but not in position 3.

I need a new guess that:
1. Includes A but not in position 3.
2. Avoids C, R, N, E.
3. Uses other common letters to test new possibilities.

Good letters to try next: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

A word that fits these constraints and covers new common letters is ""SLAID"":
- S, L, D are new consonants.
- A is in position 2 (not 3).
- I is a new vowel.

From the two previous guesses:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. SLAID → S(-) L(-) A(-) I(x) D(x)  
   – S, L, A are in the word but in wrong positions.  
   – I and D are not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, I, D  
- Letters definitely IN the word: A, S, L  
- Positions ruled out for each:
  – A cannot be in position 3 (from CRANE) or 3 (from SLAID) – still position 3 is ruled out.  
  – S cannot be in position 1 (from SLAID).  
  – L cannot be in position 2 (from SLAID).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, S, L exactly once each.  
- Does NOT contain C, R, N, E, I, D.  
- Places A somewhere other than position 3.  
- Places S somewhere other than position 1.  
- Places L somewhere other than position 2.

Remaining common letters to try: T, O, U, M, P, Y, B, G, H, K, etc.

A good candidate is “PLATO”:
- P, T, O are new consonants/vowels.  
- Contains A, S, L (but wait, PLATO doesn’t have S or L).

A better candidate is “STALK”:

Next try “PLAUS”:

- Contains A, S, L.  
- S is in position 5 (allowed).  
- L is in position 2 (but we know L cannot be in position 2). So PLAUS is invalid.

Next try “PLASM”:

- S is in position 4 (allowed).  
- L is in position 2 (still invalid).

Next try “LAPSE”:

Letters confirmed OUT: C, R, N, E, I, D, H, A (from YALSA feedback) – but wait, A is already fixed at position 2, so the second A in YALSA must be a duplicate, which is allowed in feedback since the word has only one A. The second A in position 5 is marked “-”, meaning A is in the word but not in position 5, which is already satisfied because A is in position 2.

We need a common 5-letter word that matches Y A L S _. The only common word fitting this pattern is “YALSA” (already guessed) and “YALSO” (not a word). However, “YALSA” was already played, so we need another valid word. 

Looking at the pattern, the only valid English word starting with YAL is “YALSA” (library catalog). Since that’s already been tried, the next possible word is “YALST” (not valid), “YALSM” (not valid), etc. 

Upon checking, “YALSA” is the only valid word, but since it’s already been used, we must have made an error. Re-examining the feedback for Guess 4 (YALSA → Y(-) A(✓) L(✓) S(✓) A(-)):

- Y(-) means Y is in the word but not in position 1.  
- A(✓) means A is in position 2.  
- L(✓) means L is in position 3.  
- S(✓) means S is in position 4.  
- A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 5 (already satisfied).

Thus, the word must be Y A L S _ with Y not in position 1. This is impossible because the first letter is Y. This contradiction indicates an inconsistency in the feedback, but assuming the feedback is correct, the only possible word is “YALSA” which has been played. 

However, the feedback for YALSA shows Y(-), meaning Y is in the word but not in position 1. This implies the word does not start with Y, contradicting earlier feedback where Y was marked ✓ in position 1. This suggests an error in interpretation.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a broad range of vowels and consonants. This helps gather maximum information about the secret word. A good starting word should have:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize letter coverage

Popular strong starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common)
- E (most common vowel)

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, N, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain C, R, N, E.
- DOES contain A, but not in position 3.

I need a new guess that:
1. Includes A but not in position 3.
2. Avoids C, R, N, E.
3. Uses other common letters to test new possibilities.

Good letters to try next: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

A word that fits these constraints and covers new common letters is ""SLAID"":
- S, L, D are new consonants.
- A is in position 2 (not 3).
- I is a new vowel.

Guess 2: SLAID -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(-) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. SLAID → S(-) L(-) A(-) I(x) D(x)  
   – S, L, A are in the word but in wrong positions.  
   – I and D are not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, I, D  
- Letters definitely IN the word: A, S, L  
- Positions ruled out for each:
  – A cannot be in position 3 (from CRANE) or 3 (from SLAID) – still position 3 is ruled out.  
  – S cannot be in position 1 (from SLAID).  
  – L cannot be in position 2 (from SLAID).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, S, L exactly once each.  
- Does NOT contain C, R, N, E, I, D.  
- Places A somewhere other than position 3.  
- Places S somewhere other than position 1.  
- Places L somewhere other than position 2.

Remaining common letters to try: T, O, U, M, P, Y, B, G, H, K, etc.

A good candidate is “PLATO”:
- P, T, O are new consonants/vowels.  
- Contains A, S, L (but wait, PLATO doesn’t have S or L).  
Let me rethink.

A better candidate is “STALK”:
- S, T, A, L, K.  
- Contains S, A, L.  
- S is in position 1 – but we know S cannot be in position 1. So STALK is invalid.

Next try “SLUMP”:
- S, L, U, M, P.  
- Contains S and L, but not A – violates requirement.

Next try “PLAUS”:
- P, L, A, U, S.  
- Contains A, S, L.  
- S is in position 5 (allowed).  
- L is in position 2 (but we know L cannot be in position 2). So PLAUS is invalid.

Next try “PLASM”:
- P, L, A, S, M.  
- Contains A, S, L.  
- S is in position 4 (allowed).  
- L is in position 2 (still invalid).

Next try “LAPSE”:
- L, A, P, S, E.  
- Contains A, S, L.  
- E is ruled out. So LAPSE is invalid.

Next try “LASHY”:
- L, A, S, H, Y.  
- Contains A, S, L.  
- L is in position 1 (allowed).  
- S is in position 3 (allowed).  
- A is in position 2 (allowed).  
- No forbidden letters.

So LASHY satisfies all constraints.

Positions ruled out:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2 (already fixed at 2), 3, 4, 5 → A must be in position 2 (already known).
- S cannot be in positions 1, 3, 5 (from SLAID and LASHY) → S must be in position 2 or 4, but position 2 is A → S must be in position 4.
- L cannot be in positions 1, 2, 5 (from SLAID and LASHY) → L must be in position 3.
- Y cannot be in positions 4, 5 (from LASHY) → Y must be in position 1 or 3, but position 3 is L → Y must be in position 1.

So far we have:
Y (1), A (2), L (3), S (4), and one more letter for position 5.  
The only letters still allowed are those not yet ruled out: B, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a common consonant for position 5.  
Good candidates: T, M, K, P, O, etc.

A common word fitting this pattern: Y A L S _ → “YALSO” is invalid (O is allowed but not common).  
“YALST” is not a word.  
“YALSM” is not a word.  
“YALSP” is not a word.  
“YALSK” is not a word.  
“YALST” is not a word.  
“YALSO” is not a word.  
“YALSY” is a word (though rare).  
“YALSA” is a word (a library catalog).

But we need a valid 5-letter English word.  
The pattern Y A L S _ must form a real word.  
Looking up, “YALSA” is a recognized word (a library catalog).  
Another possibility: “YALSA” is the only common word fitting.

But let me double-check:  
- Y (1), A (2), L (3), S (4), and a valid letter for 5.  
- “YALSA” is valid.  
- “YALSO” is not.  
- “YALST” is not.  
- “YALSM” is not.  
- “YALSP” is not.  
- “YALSK” is not.  
- “YALSY” is not.  
- “YALST” is not.  
- “YALSO” is not.  

Thus, “YALSA” is the only valid word fitting the constraints.

Common words fitting this pattern: “BALLY” (invalid), “FALLY” (invalid), “GALLY” (invalid), “JALLY” (invalid), “KALLY” (invalid), “MALLY” (invalid), “PALLY” (invalid), “TALLY” (valid). 

“TALLY” is a valid 5-letter word. 

Let’s check if it fits all constraints:
- T: not ruled out  
- A: position 2 ✓  
- L: position 3 ✓  
- S: position 4 ✓  
- Y: position 5 ✓  

No conflicts with previous feedback.

Allowed letters for position 4: B, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Common English 5-letter words fitting _ A L _ Y:

- FALLY (invalid)
- GALLY (invalid)
- JALLY (invalid)
- KALLY (invalid)

""WALLY"" is a valid word and fits all constraints:
- Position 1: W (not ruled out)
- Position 2: A (✓)
- Position 3: L (✓)
- Position 4: L (must be in word, and not in position 4, but position 4 is the only remaining slot for L, which contradicts L(-) in TALLY feedback).

Wait, this shows an inconsistency. The feedback for TALLY says the second L is in the word but not in position 4. However, the word must be _ A L _ Y, so the only possible positions for L are 3 and 4. Since L is already confirmed in position 3 (from LASHY feedback), the second L must be in position 4, but the feedback says it's not in position 4. This is impossible, indicating an error in interpretation.

Re-examining the feedback carefully:
- Guess 3 (LASHY): L(-) A(✓) S(-) H(x) Y(✓)

  - A(✓) position 2.
  - L(✓) position 3.
  - L(-) means the second L is in the word but not in position 4.
  - Y(✓) position 5.

This implies the word has:
- Position 2: A

- Position 5: Y
- Position 4: must be a letter not L (since L(-) in position 4)
- Position 1: must be a letter not T, C, R, N, E, I, D, H, L, S, Y, A.

The only possible word structure is: _ A L _ Y with position 4 not L, but we also have L in position 3. This seems impossible unless there's a duplicate L, but the feedback suggests only one L exists.

This indicates the word must be ""WALLY"" despite the apparent contradiction, as it's the only valid word fitting the constraints. The feedback might have meant the second L is not in position 4, which is already satisfied since position 4 is the only remaining slot for L, but this seems contradictory. However, ""WALLY"" is the only plausible word left.
