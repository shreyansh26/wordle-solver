### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to quickly identify which are in the secret word.

Looking at common 5-letter words with these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This should give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

All five letters in ""arose"" (A, R, O, S, E) are marked ""x"", so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every 5-letter word that contains any of those five letters.  
To maximize information in the second guess, I should pick a word that uses completely different letters, preferably among the most common remaining ones.

From the feedback so far:
- Letters eliminated: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L (all marked “x”)
- Letters confirmed present but in wrong positions: N and I (both marked “-”)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both N and I (since they are in the word but misplaced).
2. Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters (A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L).
3. Uses only the remaining common letters to maximize information.

Remaining common letters: D, G, H, M, Y, B, F, K, P, W, V, Z, X, Q, J (but we’ll stick to the most frequent ones first).

From the new feedback on ""windy"":
- W and D are eliminated (x).
- I is in the word and in the correct position (✓).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- Y is in the word and in the correct position (✓).

So the secret word must:
1. Have I in the 2nd position.
2. Have Y in the 5th position.
3. Contain N somewhere, but not in position 3.
4. Not contain any of the eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, W, D.

Remaining common letters (not yet eliminated): B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, X, Z, Q, J, etc.

Since I is fixed at position 2 and Y at position 5, the pattern is: _ I _ _ Y.

We need a 5-letter word fitting _ I _ _ Y with N somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but not position 3 as per feedback), and using only allowed letters.

Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4: from remaining set, common ones are B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V.

Let's try to find a valid word:
- Position 1: N is possible here (since N is in the word but not in position 3, and position 1 is allowed).
- Then positions 3 and 4 need to be filled with remaining letters.

Possible word: N I _ _ Y. Let's think of words like:
- N I M Y _ but that's 4 letters.
- N I V Y _ not a word.
- N I C H Y - but that's 5 letters: N I C H Y. Let's check letters: N, I, C, H, Y. None are eliminated. N is in position 1 (allowed), I in position 2 (correct), Y in position 5 (correct). This seems valid.

Another check: N I C H Y - yes, it's a valid English word (a type of plant).

So ""NICHY"" is a candidate. Let's verify:
- Contains N and I and Y.
- N is not in position 3 (it's in 1), so that's fine.
- I is in position 2 (correct).
- Y is in position 5 (correct).
- No eliminated letters are used.

This seems like a good next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, D. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to quickly identify which are in the secret word.

Looking at common 5-letter words with these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This should give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

All five letters in ""arose"" (A, R, O, S, E) are marked ""x"", so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every 5-letter word that contains any of those five letters.  
To maximize information in the second guess, I should pick a word that uses completely different letters, preferably among the most common remaining ones.

Common letters not yet used: T, I, N, L, U, C, D, G, H, M, Y, B, F, K, P, W, V, Z, X, Q, J.

A good candidate is ""UNTIL"" – it uses U, N, T, I, L, none of which were in the first guess, and it contains very common letters. This will help us quickly narrow down the remaining possibilities.

From the feedback so far:
- Letters eliminated: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L (all marked “x”)
- Letters confirmed present but in wrong positions: N and I (both marked “-”)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both N and I (since they are in the word but misplaced).
2. Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters (A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L).
3. Uses only the remaining common letters to maximize information.

Remaining common letters: D, G, H, M, Y, B, F, K, P, W, V, Z, X, Q, J (but we’ll stick to the most frequent ones first).

A good candidate is “MINDB” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Another candidate: “MINDS” – but S is eliminated.  
“FINDS” – S eliminated.  
“WINDY” – uses W, I, N, D, Y; none of these letters have been eliminated.

- W and D are eliminated (x).
- I is in the word and in the correct position (✓).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- Y is in the word and in the correct position (✓).

So the secret word must:

2. Have Y in the 5th position.
3. Contain N somewhere, but not in position 3.
4. Not contain any of the eliminated letters: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, W, D.

Remaining common letters (not yet eliminated): B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, X, Z, Q, J, etc.

Since I is fixed at position 2 and Y at position 5, the pattern is: _ I _ _ Y.

We need a 5-letter word fitting _ I _ _ Y with N somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but not position 3 as per feedback), and using only allowed letters.

Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4: from remaining set, common ones are B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, V.

Let's try to find a valid word:
- Position 1: N is possible here (since N is in the word but not in position 3, and position 1 is allowed).
- Then positions 3 and 4 need to be filled with remaining letters.

Possible word: N I _ _ Y. Let's think of words like:
- N I M Y _ but that's 4 letters.
- N I V Y _ not a word.
- N I C H Y - but that's 5 letters: N I C H Y. Let's check letters: N, I, C, H, Y. None are eliminated. N is in position 1 (allowed), I in position 2 (correct), Y in position 5 (correct). This seems valid.

Another check: N I C H Y - yes, it's a valid English word (a type of plant).

So ""NICHY"" is a candidate. Let's verify:
- Contains N and I and Y.
- N is not in position 3 (it's in 1), so that's fine.
- I is in position 2 (correct).
- Y is in position 5 (correct).
- No eliminated letters are used.

This seems like a good next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: until -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)

From the feedback on ""nicly"":
- N is now in the correct position (position 1: ✓).
- I is in the correct position (position 2: ✓).
- C and L are not in the word (x).
- Y is in the correct position (position 5: ✓).

So the secret word must be:
N I _ _ Y
with positions 3 and 4 to be determined, using only letters not yet eliminated.

Eliminated letters so far: A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, W, D, C.

Remaining common letters for positions 3 and 4: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, X, Z, Q, J.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form N I _ _ Y.

Possible candidates:
- N I B B Y – but B is repeated, and we don’t know if B is allowed (it hasn’t been eliminated).
- N I F F Y – same issue.
- N I G G Y – same.
- N I H H Y – same.
- N I K K Y – same.
- N I M M Y – same.
- N I P P Y – same.
- N I V V Y – same.

Looking for valid words, ""NIBBY"" is a valid English word (meaning a small piece of something). Let’s check:
- N I B B Y – letters used: N, I, B, B, Y. None of these are in the eliminated list.
- N is in position 1 (✓), I in 2 (✓), Y in 5 (✓).
- B is allowed (not eliminated).

Another possibility is ""NIPPY"" – but that’s less common. ""NIBBY"" seems better.

Let’s go with ""NIBBY"".

- N I H H Y – ""NIHNY"" is not a word.

- N I M M Y – ""NIMMY"" is valid (slang for a woman).
- N I P P Y – ""NIPPY"" is valid (meaning quick or sharp).

Among these, ""NIPPY"" and ""NIMMY"" are valid. ""NIPPY"" is more common, so let's choose that.
