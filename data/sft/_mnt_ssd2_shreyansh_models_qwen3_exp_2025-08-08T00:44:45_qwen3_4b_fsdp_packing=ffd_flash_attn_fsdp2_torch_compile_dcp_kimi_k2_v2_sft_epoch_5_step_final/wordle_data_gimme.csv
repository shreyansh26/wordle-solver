### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters in the English language. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible without repeating any letters.

Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly strong because it includes C, R, A, N, E - covering 5 of the 10 most common letters. This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

- It ends in E (matches the ✓).
- It uses S, T, O, L – none of which have been ruled out yet.
- It doesn’t contain C, R, A, or N.

Another possibility is ""PLUME"" but that has U which is less common. ""STOLE"" seems like the better choice here for maximizing new information.

The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible without repeating any letters.\n\nSome popular starting words include:\n- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)\n- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)\n- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)\n- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)\n- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)\n\nAmong these, ""CRANE"" is particularly strong because it includes C, R, A, N, E - covering 5 of the 10 most common letters. This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on CRANE:\n- C(x) – C is not in the word.\n- R(x) – R is not in the word.\n- A(x) – A is not in the word.\n- N(x) – N is not in the word.\n- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).\n\nSo we know:\n- The word ends in E.\n- It does NOT contain C, R, A, or N.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that ends in E and avoids those four letters. Let’s look for common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out. The remaining common letters include S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\nA good next guess would be one that introduces several new common letters while fitting the constraints. ""STOLE"" comes to mind because:\n- It ends in E (matches the ✓).\n- It uses S, T, O, L – none of which have been ruled out yet.\n- It doesn’t contain C, R, A, or N.\n\nAnother possibility is ""PLUME"" but that has U which is less common.

From the feedback so far:

- Position 5 is definitely E.
- Position 1 is definitely G.
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (it’s marked “-”).
- U, D are not in the word at all.
- C, R, A, N, S, T, O, L are also ruled out.

So the pattern is:
G _ _ _ E  
with the letters that are still allowed: B, F, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus I, but I cannot be in position 3).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with G.
2. Ends with E.
3. Contains I somewhere except position 3.
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible candidates:
- G I V E D – but D is ruled out.
- G I V E R – R is ruled out.
- G I V E N – N is ruled out.
- G I V E S – S is ruled out.
- G I V E Y – Y is allowed, but “GIVEY” isn’t a valid word.
- G I V E T – T is ruled out.
- G I V E H – H is allowed, but “GIVEH” isn’t valid.
- G I V E M – M is allowed, “GIVEM” isn’t valid.
- G I V E B – B is allowed, “GIVEB” isn’t valid.

We need a valid English word. Let’s try “GIMME”:
- Starts with G, ends with E.
- Contains I in position 2 (allowed, since I cannot be in position 3).
- Uses M (allowed) and double M (allowed, no rule against repeats).
- No ruled-out letters.

Another candidate: “GIMME” fits perfectly.
