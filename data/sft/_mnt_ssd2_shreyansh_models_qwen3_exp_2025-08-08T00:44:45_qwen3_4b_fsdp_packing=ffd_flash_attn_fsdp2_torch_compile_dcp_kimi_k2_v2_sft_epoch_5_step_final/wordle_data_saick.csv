Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""RAISE"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear frequently in English words. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities based on the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and S, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain R, O, or E.

Next guess should use new letters and place A and S in different positions. Good candidates are words like SLANT, STAIN, SPASM, etc. I'll pick ""STAIN"" because it uses common letters T, I, N and moves A to position 2 and S to position 1. This should help identify the correct positions for A and S while introducing new letters.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. STAIN → S(✓) T(x) A(-) I(-) N(x)
   - S is in position 1 (✓) – so S is fixed in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.
   - T and N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains A and I, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain R, O, E, T, N.

Letters still allowed: A, I, plus any others not yet ruled out (e.g., D, L, C, M, etc.).

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing A and I, avoiding positions 3 for A and 4 for I, and avoiding R, O, E, T, N.

Possible patterns: S _ _ _ _
We need to place A and I in positions 2, 3, 5 (since they can’t be in 3 and 4 respectively).

Let’s try:
- S A _ _ _ (A in position 2)
- S _ A _ _ (A in position 3 – but A can’t be in position 3, so skip)
- S _ _ A _ (A in position 4 – but S is in position 1, A can’t be in position 4, so skip)
- S _ _ _ A (A in position 5 – possible)

Similarly for I:
- S _ I _ _ (I in position 3 – possible)
- S _ _ I _ (I in position 4 – but I can’t be in position 4, so skip)
- S _ _ _ I (I in position 5 – possible)

Let’s combine these:
- S A _ _ _ with I in position 3 or 5
- S _ _ _ A with I in position 3
- S _ _ _ I with A in position 2 or 3 (but A can’t be in 3)

So possible words:
- S A _ I _ (but I can’t be in position 4, so skip)
- S A _ _ I (A in 2, I in 5)
- S _ A I _ (but A can’t be in 3, so skip)
- S _ _ A I (A in 4 – skip)
- S _ _ I A (A in 5, I in 4 – but I can’t be in 4, so skip)

Best seems S A _ _ I with I in 5. We need two middle letters. Allowed letters (excluding ruled-out): A, I, and others not used yet. Let’s try common letters like L, D, C, M, etc.

Possible word: S A L I D – but D is allowed, I is allowed, A is allowed, S is fixed. Check positions:
- S A L I D: positions 1-5: S, A, L, I, D
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- I is in position 4 – but feedback says I is in the word but not in position 4. So this is invalid.

Next: S A L I _ – but I can’t be in 4. So S A L I _ is invalid.

Try S A L _ I – positions: S, A, L, _, I
- A in 2, I in 5 – both allowed.
- Need a letter for position 4 that hasn’t been ruled out. Allowed letters: any except R, O, E, T, N.
Let’s pick L again – S A L L I – but double L is possible. Check feedback: no info against double letters.

Another option: S A C I D – but C and D are allowed, but positions: S, A, C, I, D – I in 4 again, invalid.

Try S A M I D – same issue.

Try S A L I D – same issue.

Wait, maybe I should place I in position 3. Let’s try S _ I _ _ with A in 5.

So: S _ I _ A
- I in 3 (allowed)
- A in 5 (allowed)
Need letters for positions 2 and 4. Allowed letters: any except R, O, E, T, N.

Possible: S C I D A – but D and A are allowed, C is allowed. Check positions:
- S C I D A: positions 1-5: S, C, I, D, A
- A is in 5 (allowed)
- I is in 3 (allowed)
- C and D are new letters, not ruled out.

This seems valid. Let me verify:
- S is in 1 (✓)
- C is new
- I is in 3 (allowed)
- D is new
- A is in 5 (allowed)

This should give us more information about C and D, and confirm positions of A and I.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""RAISE"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear frequently in English words. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities based on the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 1st position.

- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.

- Does NOT contain R, O, or E.

Next guess should use new letters and place A and S in different positions. Good candidates are words like SLANT, STAIN, SPASM, etc. I'll pick ""STAIN"" because it uses common letters T, I, N and moves A to position 2 and S to position 1.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. STAIN → S(✓) T(x) A(-) I(-) N(x)
   - S is in position 1 (✓) – so S is fixed in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.
   - T and N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains A and I, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain R, O, E, T, N.

Letters still allowed: A, I, plus any others not yet ruled out (e.g., D, L, C, M, etc.).

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing A and I, avoiding positions 3 for A and 4 for I, and avoiding R, O, E, T, N.

Possible patterns: S _ _ _ _
We need to place A and I in positions 2, 3, 5 (since they can’t be in 3 and 4 respectively).

Let’s try:
- S A _ _ _ (A in position 2)
- S _ A _ _ (A in position 3 – but A can’t be in position 3, so skip)
- S _ _ A _ (A in position 4 – but S is in position 1, A can’t be in position 4, so skip)
- S _ _ _ A (A in position 5 – possible)

Similarly for I:
- S _ I _ _ (I in position 3 – possible)
- S _ _ I _ (I in position 4 – but I can’t be in position 4, so skip)
- S _ _ _ I (I in position 5 – possible)

Let’s combine these:
- S A _ _ _ with I in position 3 or 5
- S _ _ _ A with I in position 3
- S _ _ _ I with A in position 2 or 3 (but A can’t be in 3)

So possible words:
- S A _ I _ (but I can’t be in position 4, so skip)
- S A _ _ I (A in 2, I in 5)
- S _ A I _ (but A can’t be in 3, so skip)
- S _ _ A I (A in 4 – skip)
- S _ _ I A (A in 5, I in 4 – but I can’t be in 4, so skip)

Best seems S A _ _ I with I in 5. We need two middle letters. Allowed letters (excluding ruled-out): A, I, and others not used yet. Let’s try common letters like L, D, C, M, etc.

Possible word: S A L I D – but D is allowed, I is allowed, A is allowed, S is fixed. Check positions:
- S A L I D: positions 1-5: S, A, L, I, D
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- I is in position 4 – but feedback says I is in the word but not in position 4. So this is invalid.

Next: S A L I _ – but I can’t be in 4. So S A L I _ is invalid.

Try S A L _ I – positions: S, A, L, _, I
- A in 2, I in 5 – both allowed.
- Need a letter for position 4 that hasn’t been ruled out. Allowed letters: any except R, O, E, T, N.
Let’s pick L again – S A L L I – but double L is possible. Check feedback: no info against double letters.

Another option: S A C I D – but C and D are allowed, but positions: S, A, C, I, D – I in 4 again, invalid.

Try S A M I D – same issue.

Try S A L I D – same issue.

Wait, maybe I should place I in position 3. Let’s try S _ I _ _ with A in 5.

So: S _ I _ A
- I in 3 (allowed)
- A in 5 (allowed)
Need letters for positions 2 and 4. Allowed letters: any except R, O, E, T, N.

Possible: S C I D A – but D and A are allowed, C is allowed. Check positions:
- S C I D A: positions 1-5: S, C, I, D, A
- A is in 5 (allowed)
- I is in 3 (allowed)
- C and D are new letters, not ruled out.

This seems valid. Let me verify:
- S is in 1 (✓)
- C is new
- I is in 3 (allowed)
- D is new
- A is in 5 (allowed)

This should give us more information about C and D, and confirm positions of A and I.

The feedback from Guess 3 was that the model answer is not five letters. That means the feedback provided (S C I D A) was not actually the secret word, and the system is simply confirming that the feedback format is correct for a five-letter word. 

From the previous feedback:
- S is fixed in position 1.
- A and I are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, N.
- Additional letters we have not tested: C, D, L, M, P, U, etc.

We need a five-letter word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Contains A and I, but:
   - A is not in position 3.
   - I is not in position 4.
3. Does not contain R, O, E, T, N.

Possible patterns:
- S _ _ _ _
- Must include A and I, with A not in 3 and I not in 4.

Let's list possible positions for A and I:
- A can be in 2, 4, or 5.
- I can be in 2, 3, or 5.

Possible combinations:
- A in 2, I in 3: S A I _ _
- A in 2, I in 5: S A _ _ I
- A in 4, I in 2: S I _ A _
- A in 4, I in 3: S _ I A _
- A in 5, I in 2: S I _ _ A
- A in 5, I in 3: S _ I _ A

Let's pick one of these patterns and fill with allowed letters. For example, let's try S A _ _ I (A in 2, I in 5):
- S A _ _ I
- Need letters for positions 3 and 4 from allowed set (no R, O, E, T, N).
- Common letters: L, M, P, U, etc.

Possible word: S A L M I
- S A L M I: positions 1-5: S, A, L, M, I

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word with 5 distinct common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""RAISE"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) that appear frequently in English words. This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down the possibilities based on the feedback.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and S, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain R, O, or E.

Next guess should use new letters and place A and S in different positions. Good candidates are words like SLANT, STAIN, SPASM, etc. I'll pick ""STAIN"" because it uses common letters T, I, N and moves A to position 2 and S to position 1. This should help identify the correct positions for A and S while introducing new letters.

Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) A(-) I(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. STAIN → S(✓) T(x) A(-) I(-) N(x)
   - S is in position 1 (✓) – so S is fixed in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - I is in the word but not in position 4.
   - T and N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with S.
- Contains A and I, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain R, O, E, T, N.

Letters still allowed: A, I, plus any others not yet ruled out (e.g., D, L, C, M, etc.).

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing A and I, avoiding positions 3 for A and 4 for I, and avoiding R, O, E, T, N.

Possible patterns: S _ _ _ _
We need to place A and I in positions 2, 3, 5 (since they can’t be in 3 and 4 respectively).

Let’s try:
- S A _ _ _ (A in position 2)
- S _ A _ _ (A in position 3 – but A can’t be in position 3, so skip)
- S _ _ A _ (A in position 4 – but S is in position 1, A can’t be in position 4, so skip)
- S _ _ _ A (A in position 5 – possible)

Similarly for I:
- S _ I _ _ (I in position 3 – possible)
- S _ _ I _ (I in position 4 – but I can’t be in position 4, so skip)
- S _ _ _ I (I in position 5 – possible)

Let’s combine these:
- S A _ _ _ with I in position 3 or 5
- S _ _ _ A with I in position 3
- S _ _ _ I with A in position 2 or 3 (but A can’t be in 3)

So possible words:
- S A _ I _ (but I can’t be in position 4, so skip)
- S A _ _ I (A in 2, I in 5)
- S _ A I _ (but A can’t be in 3, so skip)
- S _ _ A I (A in 4 – skip)
- S _ _ I A (A in 5, I in 4 – but I can’t be in 4, so skip)

Best seems S A _ _ I with I in 5. We need two middle letters. Allowed letters (excluding ruled-out): A, I, and others not used yet. Let’s try common letters like L, D, C, M, etc.

Possible word: S A L I D – but D is allowed, I is allowed, A is allowed, S is fixed. Check positions:
- S A L I D: positions 1-5: S, A, L, I, D
- A is in position 2 (allowed)
- I is in position 4 – but feedback says I is in the word but not in position 4. So this is invalid.

Next: S A L I _ – but I can’t be in 4. So S A L I _ is invalid.

Try S A L _ I – positions: S, A, L, _, I
- A in 2, I in 5 – both allowed.
- Need a letter for position 4 that hasn’t been ruled out. Allowed letters: any except R, O, E, T, N.
Let’s pick L again – S A L L I – but double L is possible. Check feedback: no info against double letters.

Another option: S A C I D – but C and D are allowed, but positions: S, A, C, I, D – I in 4 again, invalid.

Try S A M I D – same issue.

Try S A L I D – same issue.

Wait, maybe I should place I in position 3. Let’s try S _ I _ _ with A in 5.

So: S _ I _ A
- I in 3 (allowed)
- A in 5 (allowed)
Need letters for positions 2 and 4. Allowed letters: any except R, O, E, T, N.

Possible: S C I D A – but D and A are allowed, C is allowed. Check positions:
- S C I D A: positions 1-5: S, C, I, D, A
- A is in 5 (allowed)
- I is in 3 (allowed)
- C and D are new letters, not ruled out.

This seems valid. Let me verify:
- S is in 1 (✓)
- C is new
- I is in 3 (allowed)
- D is new
- A is in 5 (allowed)

This should give us more information about C and D, and confirm positions of A and I.

The feedback from Guess 3 was that the model answer is not five letters. That means the feedback provided (S C I D A) was not actually the secret word, and the system is simply confirming that the feedback format is correct for a five-letter word. 

From the previous feedback:
- S is fixed in position 1.
- A and I are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, N.
- Additional letters we have not tested: C, D, L, M, P, U, etc.

We need a five-letter word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Contains A and I, but:
   - A is not in position 3.
   - I is not in position 4.
3. Does not contain R, O, E, T, N.

Possible patterns:
- S _ _ _ _
- Must include A and I, with A not in 3 and I not in 4.

Let's list possible positions for A and I:
- A can be in 2, 4, or 5.
- I can be in 2, 3, or 5.

Possible combinations:
- A in 2, I in 3: S A I _ _
- A in 2, I in 5: S A _ _ I
- A in 4, I in 2: S I _ A _
- A in 4, I in 3: S _ I A _
- A in 5, I in 2: S I _ _ A
- A in 5, I in 3: S _ I _ A

Let's pick one of these patterns and fill with allowed letters. For example, let's try S A _ _ I (A in 2, I in 5):
- S A _ _ I
- Need letters for positions 3 and 4 from allowed set (no R, O, E, T, N).

- S _ _ _ I (I in 5)

But we must also place the other letters from the allowed set.

Looking at the allowed letters, let's try to construct a word:
- S A _ _ _ : Need I somewhere. Possible positions 3, 5.
   - S A I _ _ : I in 3, A in 2. Need two more letters from allowed set.
   - S A _ _ I : I in 5, A in 2. Need two more letters from allowed set.

- S _ _ _ A : A in 5, need I in 2, 3.
   - S I _ _ A : I in 2, A in 5. Need two more letters from allowed set.
   - S _ I _ A : I in 3, A in 5. Need two more letters from allowed set.

Let's pick one pattern and fill with allowed letters. For example, S I _ _ A:
- S I _ _ A
- Need two letters for positions 3 and 4 from allowed set: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Let's choose common letters: P and Y.
- Word: S I P Y A

Check constraints:
- S in 1 (✓)
- I in 2 (allowed)
- P and Y from allowed set (✓)
- A in 5 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters (✓)
