For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E (common letters)
- ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E (also very common)
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E (high vowel count)

I think ""CRANE"" is a strong first guess because it covers several common consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E). This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are not in the word (x).
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (-).

So the secret word contains an N, but not in the 4th slot. The remaining letters we haven’t tested yet include common ones like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, M, P, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Re-use the N in a different position.
2. Introduce several new common letters we haven’t tried yet.

Possible candidates:
- STING (S, T, I, N, G) – uses N in position 4 (different from previous position 4).
- LINED (L, I, N, E, D) – but E was already ruled out.
- MONEY (M, O, N, E, Y) – E and Y are new, but E is ruled out.
- STUNG (S, T, U, N, G) – uses N in position 4 again, but G and U are new.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E (common letters)
- ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E (also very common)
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E (high vowel count)

I think ""CRANE"" is a strong first guess because it covers several common consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E). This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are not in the word (x).
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (-).

So the secret word contains an N, but not in the 4th slot. The remaining letters we haven’t tested yet include common ones like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, M, P, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Re-use the N in a different position.
2. Introduce several new common letters we haven’t tried yet.

Possible candidates:
- STING (S, T, I, N, G) – uses N in position 4 (different from previous position 4).
- LINED (L, I, N, E, D) – but E was already ruled out.
- MONEY (M, O, N, E, Y) – E and Y are new, but E is ruled out.
- STUNG (S, T, U, N, G) – uses N in position 4 again, but G and U are new.

I’ll go with STUNG because:
- It moves N to position 4 (which was previously ruled out for position 4).
- Introduces S, T, U, G – all new letters that are common.

- Letters already ruled out: C, R, A, E, S, T, U.

Remaining common letters to test: B, D, F, H, I, L, M, O, P, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Place N in a new position (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- Include G in a new position (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4).
- Introduce several new common letters.

Possible candidates:
- BINGO (B, I, N, G, O) – N in position 3, G in position 4, new letters B, I, O.
- GINNY (G, I, N, N, Y) – but N is already known to appear once (no double N info yet).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" uses S, L, A, T, E (common letters)
- ""CRANE"" uses C, R, A, N, E (also very common)
- ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E (high vowel count)

I think ""CRANE"" is a strong first guess because it covers several common consonants (C, R, N) and two common vowels (A, E). This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C, R, A, E are not in the word (x).
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (-).

So the secret word contains an N, but not in the 4th slot. The remaining letters we haven’t tested yet include common ones like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, M, P, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Re-use the N in a different position.
2. Introduce several new common letters we haven’t tried yet.

Possible candidates:
- STING (S, T, I, N, G) – uses N in position 4 (different from previous position 4).
- LINED (L, I, N, E, D) – but E was already ruled out.
- MONEY (M, O, N, E, Y) – E and Y are new, but E is ruled out.
- STUNG (S, T, U, N, G) – uses N in position 4 again, but G and U are new.

I’ll go with STUNG because:
- It moves N to position 4 (which was previously ruled out for position 4).
- Introduces S, T, U, G – all new letters that are common.

Guess 2: STUNG -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) U(x) N(-) G(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
   - Letters ruled out: C, R, A, E
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STUNG → S(x) T(x) U(x) N(-) G(-)
   - Letters ruled out: S, T, U
   - N is still in the word but not in position 4 (confirmed).
   - G is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word contains N (not in position 4) and G (not in position 5).
- Letters already ruled out: C, R, A, E, S, T, U.

Remaining common letters to test: B, D, F, H, I, L, M, O, P, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Place N in a new position (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
- Include G in a new position (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4).
- Introduce several new common letters.

Possible candidates:
- BINGO (B, I, N, G, O) – N in position 3, G in position 4, new letters B, I, O.
- GINNY (G, I, N, N, Y) – but N is already known to appear once (no double N info yet).
- FLING (F, L, I, N, G) – N in position 4 (but feedback says N is not in position 4), so skip.
- WINDY (W, I, N, D, Y) – N in position 3, G not used.

I’ll choose BINGO because:
- N is in position 3 (new position).
- G is in position 4 (new position).
- Introduces B, I, O – all new common letters.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
   - Letters ruled out: C, R, A, E
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STUNG → S(x) T(x) U(x) N(-) G(-)
   - Letters ruled out: S, T, U
   - N is still in the word but not in position 4 (confirmed).
   - G is in the word but not in position 5.

3. BINGO → B(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓) O(x)
   - Letters ruled out: B, O
   - I is in position 2 (correct).
   - N is in position 3 (correct).
   - G is in position 4 (correct).

So we now know the exact pattern:
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: G
- Letters already ruled out: C, R, A, E, S, T, U, B, O

The word looks like: _ I N G _

We need to find the first and fifth letters from the remaining unused letters. Common letters not yet tested: D, F, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible candidates:
- FINCH (F, I, N, G, H) – but H is new.
- WINGY (W, I, N, G, Y) – Y is new.
- PINGO – but O is ruled out.
- LINGO – but O is ruled out.
- DINGY – D and Y are new.

""FINCH"" seems good because:
- F and H are common and haven't been tested.
- It fits the pattern _ I N G _.

But let's check if there's a better fit. Another candidate is ""WINGY"":
- W and Y are new letters.

I'll go with ""WINGY"" as it uses W and Y, both new letters.

Remaining common letters that haven’t been tested: D, F, H, L, M, P, V

We need two letters that fit the pattern _ I N G _. The only common 5-letter words fitting this pattern are:

- DINGY (D, I, N, G, Y) – Y is ruled out.
- FINCH (F, I, N, G, H)
- PINGO – O is ruled out.
- LINGO – O is ruled out.

FINCH uses F and H, both of which are still allowed.
