### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- Uses letters that appear in many 5-letter words

This should give good coverage to start narrowing down the secret word.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
R, E, L, N, C, T

Letters that ARE in the word (but still in wrong positions):  
A, O, S (each has appeared once so far, so they must appear exactly once)

Positions already ruled out for each of A, O, S:

A: cannot be 1st, 2nd, 3rd → must be 4th or 5th  
O: cannot be 3rd, 4th, 2nd → must be 1st or 5th  
S: cannot be 1st, 4th, 3rd → must be 2nd or 5th  

So the only remaining positions are:

A: 4 or 5  
O: 1 or 5  
S: 2 or 5  

The only way these can coexist is if all three letters occupy the 5th position, which is impossible.  
Therefore, one of A, O, S must appear twice in the word (since they have not been confirmed unique).

The simplest assumption is that one of them appears twice and the other two appear once.  
Let’s test the word “SOAKS”:
- S appears twice (positions 1 and 5)  
- O appears once (position 2)  
- A appears once (position 3)  
- K is new (position 4)  

This satisfies:
- S: allowed in 1st and 5th  
- O: allowed in 2nd  
- A: allowed in 3rd  
- K: new letter

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- Uses letters that appear in many 5-letter words

This should give good coverage to start narrowing down the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(x): R is NOT in the word.
- O(-): O is in the word but in the wrong position (not 3rd).
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position (not 4th).
- E(x): E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, E
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong spots): A, O, S
- Positions we can eliminate: 1st (A), 3rd (O), 4th (S)

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, O, S (but not in the eliminated positions)
- Does NOT contain R or E
- Uses other common letters to maximize information

Possible positions for A, O, S:
- A can be 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th
- O can be 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th
- S can be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th

I’ll pick a word that places these letters in new spots and introduces new common consonants. A good candidate is “SALON”:
- S (1st) – new position
- A (2nd) – new position
- L (3rd) – new letter
- O (4th) – new position
- N (5th) – new letter

This tests new positions for A, O, S and introduces L and N.

Positions already ruled out:
- A: cannot be 1st or 2nd

- S: cannot be 1st or 4th

So the remaining positions for each of A, O, S are:
- A: 3rd, 4th, 5th
- O: 1st, 2nd, 5th
- S: 2nd, 3rd, 5th

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, O, S exactly once each (since they appeared only once in previous guesses)
- Does not use R, E, L, N
- Places A, O, S in still-allowed positions
- Introduces two new, common consonants to test

Good remaining consonants: T, C, D, M, P, etc.

Let’s try “COAST”:
- C – new letter
- O – allowed in 2nd position
- A – allowed in 3rd position
- S – allowed in 4th position
- T – new letter

This satisfies all constraints and gives us fresh information.

From the feedback on SOAKS:

S(-) – first S is in the word but wrong position (not 1st)

A(-) – A is in the word but wrong position (not 3rd)  
K(x) – K is not in the word  
S(✓) – last S is correct in 5th position  

So we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: R, E, L, N, C, T, K  
2. Letters that ARE in the word: A, O, S (and S is fixed at 5th position)  
3. Positions ruled out for each:

   - O: cannot be 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th → must be 1st  
   - S: fixed at 5th  

Thus the pattern must be:  
O _ A _ S  

We need two more letters (positions 2 and 4) that are NOT any of R, E, L, N, C, T, K.  
Common remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, etc.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowel positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeating letters
- Uses letters that appear in many 5-letter words

This should give good coverage to start narrowing down the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(x): R is NOT in the word.
- O(-): O is in the word but in the wrong position (not 3rd).
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position (not 4th).
- E(x): E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, E
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong spots): A, O, S
- Positions we can eliminate: 1st (A), 3rd (O), 4th (S)

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, O, S (but not in the eliminated positions)
- Does NOT contain R or E
- Uses other common letters to maximize information

Possible positions for A, O, S:
- A can be 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th
- O can be 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th
- S can be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th

I’ll pick a word that places these letters in new spots and introduces new common consonants. A good candidate is “SALON”:
- S (1st) – new position
- A (2nd) – new position
- L (3rd) – new letter
- O (4th) – new position
- N (5th) – new letter

This tests new positions for A, O, S and introduces L and N.

From the two previous guesses we now know:

Letters NOT in the word at all: R, E, L, N  
Letters that ARE in the word (but still in wrong positions): A, O, S  

Positions already ruled out:
- A: cannot be 1st or 2nd
- O: cannot be 3rd or 4th
- S: cannot be 1st or 4th

So the remaining positions for each of A, O, S are:
- A: 3rd, 4th, 5th
- O: 1st, 2nd, 5th
- S: 2nd, 3rd, 5th

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, O, S exactly once each (since they appeared only once in previous guesses)
- Does not use R, E, L, N
- Places A, O, S in still-allowed positions
- Introduces two new, common consonants to test

Good remaining consonants: T, C, D, M, P, etc.

Let’s try “COAST”:
- C – new letter
- O – allowed in 2nd position
- A – allowed in 3rd position
- S – allowed in 4th position
- T – new letter

This satisfies all constraints and gives us fresh information.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)

Guess 3: COAST -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(-) A(-) S(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
R, E, L, N, C, T

Letters that ARE in the word (but still in wrong positions):  
A, O, S (each has appeared once so far, so they must appear exactly once)

Positions already ruled out for each of A, O, S:

A: cannot be 1st, 2nd, 3rd → must be 4th or 5th  
O: cannot be 3rd, 4th, 2nd → must be 1st or 5th  
S: cannot be 1st, 4th, 3rd → must be 2nd or 5th  

So the only remaining positions are:

A: 4 or 5  
O: 1 or 5  
S: 2 or 5  

The only way these can coexist is if all three letters occupy the 5th position, which is impossible.  
Therefore, one of A, O, S must appear twice in the word (since they have not been confirmed unique).

The simplest assumption is that one of them appears twice and the other two appear once.  
Let’s test the word “SOAKS”:
- S appears twice (positions 1 and 5)  
- O appears once (position 2)  
- A appears once (position 3)  
- K is new (position 4)  

This satisfies:
- S: allowed in 1st and 5th  
- O: allowed in 2nd  
- A: allowed in 3rd  
- K: new letter  

We’ll try SOAKS.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: R, E, L, N, C, T, K  
Letters confirmed in the word: A, O, S, S (the last S is in the correct 5th position)

Positions ruled out so far:
- A: cannot be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th → must be 5th (but 5th is already S ✓)
- O: cannot be 2nd, 3rd, 4th → must be 1st
- S: cannot be 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th (last S is ✓) → must be 2nd

So far we have:
1st: O
2nd: S
3rd: ?
4th: ?
5th: S

We need two more letters that are NOT in {R, E, L, N, C, T, K}. Common remaining consonants: D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

We also know A must appear somewhere, but positions 1,2,3,5 are taken by O,S,?,S. The only remaining spot is 4th, but 4th is still open. However, A cannot be 4th (ruled out by earlier feedback). This implies A must appear twice.

Thus the word must be: O S A A S

Check constraints:
- O in 1st: allowed (only 2nd,3rd,4th were ruled out for O, 1st is fine)
- S in 2nd: allowed (ruled out 1st,3rd,4th,5th, but 2nd is fine)
- A in 3rd: allowed (ruled out 1st,2nd,4th,5th, but 3rd is fine)
- A in 4th: allowed (only 1st,2nd,3rd,5th were ruled out for A, 4th is fine)
- S in 5th: confirmed ✓

So the word must be ""OSAAS"". However, ""OSAAS"" is not a valid English word. This suggests an error in assumption.

Re-evaluate: the feedback shows S in 5th is correct, but A must still appear. The only remaining positions for A are 3rd and 4th, but both are ruled out. This implies A must appear twice, but we have no evidence for a second A.

This indicates the word must be: O S A A S, but since this is invalid, the only remaining possibility is that A appears once and the word is O S A _ S, but position 4 is open and must be a new letter not yet ruled out.

Possible letters for 4th: D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

Let's try ""OSADS"" - but D is allowed, S is already in 5th, but we can't have two S's.

Wait, the word must be O S _ _ S with A somewhere. The only valid English word fitting is ""OSARS"" but R is ruled out.
