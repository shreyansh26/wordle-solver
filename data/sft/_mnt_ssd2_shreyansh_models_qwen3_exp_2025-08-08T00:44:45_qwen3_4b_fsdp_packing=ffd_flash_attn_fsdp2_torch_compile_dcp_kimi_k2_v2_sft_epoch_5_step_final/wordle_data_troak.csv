### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters and covers as many different vowels and consonants as possible. This helps eliminate or confirm many letters early on.

A good starting word should:
1. Include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Include common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. Avoid repeating letters to maximize coverage

After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", and ""ADIEU"", ""SLATE"" stands out because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of high-frequency letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, E, C, Y

We also need two more distinct letters (from the remaining unused alphabet) to fill the remaining two slots, ensuring no duplicates and no forbidden letters.

From the new feedback on TRAMP:
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (was in position 3, so must move to 4 or 5).
- M and P are not in the word.

So far we know:
Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, E, C, Y, M, P  
Letters that ARE in the word and their correct positions:
- T in position 1
- R in position 2
Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- A (must be in position 4 or 5)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with T and second letter R (TR _ _ _).
2. Contains A in either position 4 or 5.
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated (so no S, L, E, C, Y, M, P).

Possible remaining letters (from the alphabet excluding the eliminated ones): A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need two more letters to fill positions 3 and 5 (or 3 and 4 if A is in 5). Let’s list possible combinations:

- TRA _ _: A must be in 3, but that’s invalid because A was in position 3 in TRAMP and feedback said it’s in the wrong position. So A cannot be in 3.
- TR _ A _: A in 4. Then position 3 must be filled with a valid letter not yet used. Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.
- TR _ _ A: A in 5. Then positions 3 and 4 must be filled with valid letters.

Looking for common words:
- TRA _ _: Invalid because A can’t be in 3.
- TRB A _: TRB is not a valid start.
- TR _ A _: Possible words: TRIBA (not common), TRAVA (not common), TRADA (not common), TRIGA (not common), TRIGA (not common), TRIGA (not common). None seem valid.
- TR _ _ A: Possible words: TRIGA (not common), TRIBA (not common), TRUDA (not common), TRAVA (not common), TRIBA (not common).

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe A is in position 4, so word is TR _ A _. Then position 3 must be a valid letter. Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for common words:
- TRB A _ : TRB is not valid.
- TRD A _ : TRD is not valid.
- TRF A _ : TRF is not valid.
- TRG A _ : TRG is not valid.
- TRI A _ : TRI is not valid.

- TRV A _ : TRV is not valid.
- TRW A _ : TRW is not valid.
- TRX A _ : TRX is not valid.
- TRZ A _ : TRZ is not valid.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let’s try A in position 5: TR _ _ A. Then positions 3 and 4 must be filled with valid letters. Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Possible words:
- TRB _ A : TRB is not valid.
- TRD _ A : TRD is not valid.

- TRW _ A : TRW is not valid.
- TRX _ A : TRX is not valid.

Wait, let me think of actual common words that start with TR and have A in 4 or 5. 

Looking at valid words:
- TRAGA (not common)

- TRAMP (but M and P are eliminated)
- TRASH (S is eliminated)

Hmm, none of these seem to fit. Let me try A in position 4: TR _ A _. Then position 3 must be a valid letter. Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for valid words:
- TRB A _ : TRB is not valid.

- TRV A _ : TRV is not valid.
- TRW A _ : TRW is not valid.
- TRX A _ : TRX is not valid.
- TRZ A _ : TRZ is not valid.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the word is TRA _ _ but A is in position 3, but feedback said A is in wrong position (was in 3 in TRAMP), so A cannot be in 3. So TRA _ _ is invalid.

Let me try TR _ A _. Then position 3 must be a valid letter. Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for valid words:
- TRB A _ : TRB is not valid.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let me think of actual words that start with TR and have A in 4 or 5, using only allowed letters.

This seems impossible. Let me check if I missed any letters. The remaining letters are: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Looking at valid words:
- TRIBA (not common)
- TRIVA (not common)
- TRIGA (not common)
- TRONA (not common)

- TRUNK (K is allowed, N is allowed, but U is allowed)
- TRUNK has K, N, U, but we need A in 4 or 5.
- TRUNK: T R U N K - but A is missing.
- TRUNK is invalid because it doesn't contain A.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters and covers as many different vowels and consonants as possible. This helps eliminate or confirm many letters early on.

A good starting word should:
1. Include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Include common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. Avoid repeating letters to maximize coverage

After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", and ""ADIEU"", ""SLATE"" stands out because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of high-frequency letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- T: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains A and T, but neither is in its current position (A was 3rd, T was 4th).
- The word does NOT contain S, L, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and T.
2. Places A somewhere other than position 3.
3. Places T somewhere other than position 4.
4. Avoids S, L, E.

Let’s look for words that fit these constraints. Some candidates:
- CARTY – uses C, R, Y; has A in 2nd and T in 3rd (both new positions).
- PATIO – uses P, I, O; has A in 2nd and T in 3rd (both new positions).
- MATRO – uses M, R, O; has A in 2nd and T in 3rd (both new positions).
- TACET – uses T, C, E (but E is excluded, so discard).
- TRACT – uses T, R, C; has A in 3rd (same as original position, so discard).

Among these, ""CARTY"" looks good: it includes A and T in new positions and avoids forbidden letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CARTY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(-) R(-) T(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, E, C, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, T, R (but none of them are in their current positions)

Current positions:
- A was in slot 2 (CARTY) → must move to 1, 3, 4, or 5  
- T was in slot 4 (CARTY) → must move to 1, 2, 3, or 5  
- R was in slot 3 (CARTY) → must move to 1, 2, 4, or 5  

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, T, R exactly once each.
2. Places each of them in a different slot from their previous guesses.
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated (so no S, L, E, C, Y).

Let’s list possible positions for A, T, R that satisfy the constraints:
- A cannot be in 2 → possible in 1, 3, 4, 5
- T cannot be in 4 → possible in 1, 2, 3, 5
- R cannot be in 3 → possible in 1, 2, 4, 5

We also need two more distinct letters (from the remaining unused alphabet) to fill the remaining two slots, ensuring no duplicates and no forbidden letters.

A quick scan of common words that fit these rules leads to:
- TRAMP: uses T, R, A, M, P  
  – T in 1 (new), R in 2 (new), A in 3 (new) – all positions are allowed  
  – M and P are new, untested letters  
  – no forbidden letters

This seems like a strong candidate.

From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)  
   – A and T are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

2. CARTY → C(x) A(-) R(-) T(-) Y(x)  
   – A is still in the word but not in position 2.  
   – R and T are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

3. TRAMP → T(✓) R(✓) A(-) M(x) P(x)  
   – T is fixed in position 1.  
   – R is fixed in position 2.  
   – A is still in the word but not in position 3.  
   – M and P are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Word must be of the form T R _ _ _  
- A must appear somewhere in positions 4 or 5.  
- Forbidden letters: S, L, E, C, Y, M, P.  
- Remaining letters to consider: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need two more distinct letters for positions 3 and 4 (or 3 and 5), chosen from the allowed set.

Possible words:
- TRAVI (but I is allowed, V is allowed) – but V is 5th, I is 4th, A is 3rd – A cannot be 3rd.
- TRADY – Y is forbidden.
- TRASH – S is forbidden.
- TRIBE – E is forbidden.
- TRUNK – N, K are allowed, U is allowed, but A is missing.
- TRAGI – A is 3rd, which is forbidden.
- TRAUM – M is forbidden.
- TRAUMA – 6 letters.
- TRAGA – A repeated, but A is allowed once.
- TRAGI – same issue as above.
- TRAWL – L is forbidden.
- TRAWN – N is allowed, W is allowed, but A is 3rd, which is forbidden.
- TRAWK – K is allowed, W is allowed, A is 3rd, forbidden.
- TRAWZ – Z is allowed, W is allowed, A is 3rd, forbidden.

Looking at the allowed letters, the only plausible word that fits is TRAVI, but A is 3rd which is forbidden. Next option is TRAGI, but A is 3rd again. 

Wait, let's list possible positions:
- T R _ _ _ with A in 4 or 5.

Possible combinations:
- T R _ A _  
- T R _ _ A  

For T R _ A _ :
- Need two distinct letters for positions 3 and 5.  
- Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Examples:
- T R I A N – but N is 5th, A is 4th – fits all constraints.  
- T R I A G – G is 5th – fits.  
- T R O A K – K is 5th – fits.  
- T R O A N – N is 5th – fits.

For T R _ _ A :
- Need two distinct letters for positions 3 and 4.  
- Examples:
- T R I N A – N is 4th, I is 3rd – fits.  
- T R I D A – D is 4th, I is 3rd – fits.  
- T R O N A – N is 4th, O is 3rd – fits.  
- T R O K A – K is 4th, O is 3rd – fits.

Among these, ""TRIAN"" (a valid word) seems the most plausible, but let's verify:
- T R I A N – positions: T(1) ✓, R(2) ✓, I(3), A(4), N(5).  
- A is in position 4, which is allowed.  
- I and N are new letters not yet tested.  
- No forbidden letters.

Thus, ""TRIAN"" is a valid next guess.

- TRAWK – K is allowed, W is allowed, A is 3rd, forbidden.
- TRAWZ – Z is allowed, W is allowed, A is 3rd, forbidden.

Looking at the allowed letters, the only plausible word that fits is TRAVI, but A is 3rd which is forbidden. Next option is TRAGI, but A is 3rd again. 

Wait, let's list possible positions:
- T R _ _ _ with A in 4 or 5.

Possible combinations:
- T R _ A _  
- T R _ _ A  

For T R _ A _ :
- Need two distinct letters for positions 3 and 5.  
- Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Examples:
- T R I A N – but N is 5th, A is 4th – fits all constraints.  
- T R I A G – G is 5th – fits.  
- T R O A K – K is 5th – fits.  
- T R O A N – N is 5th – fits.

For T R _ _ A :
- Need two distinct letters for positions 3 and 4.  
- Examples:
- T R I N A – N is 4th, I is 3rd – fits.  
- T R I D A – D is 4th, I is 3rd – fits.  
- T R O N A – N is 4th, O is 3rd – fits.  
- T R O K A – K is 4th, O is 3rd – fits.

Among these, ""TRIAN"" (a valid word) seems the most plausible, but let's verify:
- T R I A N – positions: T(1) ✓, R(2) ✓, I(3), A(4), N(5).  
- A is in position 4, which is allowed.  
- I and N are new letters not yet tested.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters and covers as many different vowels and consonants as possible. This helps eliminate or confirm many letters early on.

A good starting word should:
1. Include common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Include common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. Avoid repeating letters to maximize coverage

After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", and ""ADIEU"", ""SLATE"" stands out because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of high-frequency letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- T: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains A and T, but neither is in its current position (A was 3rd, T was 4th).
- The word does NOT contain S, L, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and T.
2. Places A somewhere other than position 3.
3. Places T somewhere other than position 4.
4. Avoids S, L, E.

Let’s look for words that fit these constraints. Some candidates:
- CARTY – uses C, R, Y; has A in 2nd and T in 3rd (both new positions).
- PATIO – uses P, I, O; has A in 2nd and T in 3rd (both new positions).
- MATRO – uses M, R, O; has A in 2nd and T in 3rd (both new positions).
- TACET – uses T, C, E (but E is excluded, so discard).
- TRACT – uses T, R, C; has A in 3rd (same as original position, so discard).

Among these, ""CARTY"" looks good: it includes A and T in new positions and avoids forbidden letters.

Guess 2: CARTY -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(-) R(-) T(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, E, C, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, T, R (but none of them are in their current positions)

Current positions:
- A was in slot 2 (CARTY) → must move to 1, 3, 4, or 5  
- T was in slot 4 (CARTY) → must move to 1, 2, 3, or 5  
- R was in slot 3 (CARTY) → must move to 1, 2, 4, or 5  

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, T, R exactly once each.
2. Places each of them in a different slot from their previous guesses.
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated (so no S, L, E, C, Y).

Let’s list possible positions for A, T, R that satisfy the constraints:
- A cannot be in 2 → possible in 1, 3, 4, 5
- T cannot be in 4 → possible in 1, 2, 3, 5
- R cannot be in 3 → possible in 1, 2, 4, 5

We also need two more distinct letters (from the remaining unused alphabet) to fill the remaining two slots, ensuring no duplicates and no forbidden letters.

A quick scan of common words that fit these rules leads to:
- TRAMP: uses T, R, A, M, P  
  – T in 1 (new), R in 2 (new), A in 3 (new) – all positions are allowed  
  – M and P are new, untested letters  
  – no forbidden letters

This seems like a strong candidate.

From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)  
   – A and T are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

2. CARTY → C(x) A(-) R(-) T(-) Y(x)  
   – A is still in the word but not in position 2.  
   – R and T are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.

3. TRAMP → T(✓) R(✓) A(-) M(x) P(x)  
   – T is fixed in position 1.  
   – R is fixed in position 2.  
   – A is still in the word but not in position 3.  
   – M and P are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Word must be of the form T R _ _ _  
- A must appear somewhere in positions 4 or 5.  
- Forbidden letters: S, L, E, C, Y, M, P.  
- Remaining letters to consider: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need two more distinct letters for positions 3 and 4 (or 3 and 5), chosen from the allowed set.

Possible words:
- TRAVI (but I is allowed, V is allowed) – but V is 5th, I is 4th, A is 3rd – A cannot be 3rd.
- TRADY – Y is forbidden.
- TRASH – S is forbidden.
- TRIBE – E is forbidden.
- TRUNK – N, K are allowed, U is allowed, but A is missing.
- TRAGI – A is 3rd, which is forbidden.
- TRAUM – M is forbidden.
- TRAUMA – 6 letters.
- TRAGA – A repeated, but A is allowed once.
- TRAGI – same issue as above.
- TRAWL – L is forbidden.
- TRAWN – N is allowed, W is allowed, but A is 3rd, which is forbidden.
- TRAWK – K is allowed, W is allowed, A is 3rd, forbidden.
- TRAWZ – Z is allowed, W is allowed, A is 3rd, forbidden.

Looking at the allowed letters, the only plausible word that fits is TRAVI, but A is 3rd which is forbidden. Next option is TRAGI, but A is 3rd again.

For T R _ A _ :

Examples:

- T R I A G – G is 5th – fits.  
- T R O A K – K is 5th – fits.  
- T R O A N – N is 5th – fits.

For T R _ _ A :
