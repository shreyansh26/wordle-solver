For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback.

One of the best starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and each letter is unique, giving maximum coverage. This will help me quickly determine which of these common letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of E and S, which are particularly common. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in the first position (A✓).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x).

So the pattern is:
A _ _ _ _

We need a 5-letter word starting with A that does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.  
Letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I want a word that introduces several new common letters to narrow down possibilities.  
Good next letters to test: I, N, T, L, C, D, M, etc.

A strong candidate is ""AUDIO"" – but it contains O, which we already know is not in the word.  
Another candidate: ""ADMIT"" – but it has I and T, which are good, and M and D are also good.  
Another: ""ALBUM"" – but it has U and M, which are okay, but B is less common.  
Another: ""ANVIL"" – but it has N, V, I, L – but V is less common.  
Another: ""AMBIT"" – but it has M, B, I, T – B is less common.  
Another: ""ADMIT"" seems best – A✓, D, M, I, T are all new letters and common.

But wait: ""ADMIT"" has A✓, D, M, I, T – but we know A is fixed in first position, so the word is A D M I T.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADMIT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) M(x) I(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word starts with A.
2. Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, D, M, T.
3. I is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was marked “-” in ADMIT).

So the pattern is:
A _ _ _ _

and the remaining letters we can still use are:
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
plus the known letter I, which must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.

I want a word that:
- starts with A,
- contains I (but not in position 4),
- uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Good candidates:
- ALINE (but N is okay, L is okay, I is okay, E is eliminated) → invalid (E).
- ALIBI (but B and I are okay, but double I may not help).
- ACHIN (but C and H and N are okay, but I is in position 3).
- ANVIL (but V and L are okay, but N and I are okay, and I is in position 4 – eliminated).
- AUKIN (but U and K and N are okay, I is in position 4 – eliminated).
- AGILE (but G, L, E – E is eliminated).
- ACHIL (but C, H, L are okay, I is in position 3).

The best seems ACHIL, but it’s not a common word.  
Another: ALINE is invalid (E).  
Another: ALIBI is possible, but B is less common.  
Another: ANVIL is invalid (I in position 4).  
Another: ACHIN is valid, but C, H, I, N are all new letters.

But wait – ACHIN is a valid 5-letter word meaning “the act of eating.”  
It fits all constraints:
- A✓ in position 1.
- Contains I (position 3).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

So I’ll guess ACHIN.

From all feedback so far:

1. Word starts with A (position 1 is fixed).
2. Letters ruled out completely: R, O, S, E, D, M, T, C, H, N.
3. The letter I is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (it was “-” in both ADMIT and ACHIN).
   Therefore I must be in position 2 or 5.

4. Still-allowed letters (besides A and I):  
   B, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

5. We need a 5-letter word that:
   - starts with A,
   - contains I,
   - has I in position 2 or 5,
   - uses only the still-allowed letters.

Let’s list possibilities:
- If I is in position 2: A I _ _ _  
  Possible: AIGER (but E is out), AIGLE (E out), AIGUI (U allowed), AILUP (L, U, P allowed), AIGUI is a valid word (variant of “aiguil” in French), but not common English.
- If I is in position 5: A _ _ _ I  
  Possible: ABLUI (but B, L, U allowed), AGLUI (G, L, U allowed), AULIU (U allowed), AULIA (A repeated, but A already fixed), AULIU is not a word, AULIA is proper noun.

The only common English word that fits is AULIA (though it’s a proper noun), but we need a common word.  
Another candidate: AULIA is invalid.  
Another: ABLUI is not a word.  
Another: AGLUI is not a word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback.

One of the best starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and each letter is unique, giving maximum coverage. This will help me quickly determine which of these common letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of E and S, which are particularly common. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in the first position (A✓).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x).

So the pattern is:
A _ _ _ _

We need a 5-letter word starting with A that does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.  
Letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I want a word that introduces several new common letters to narrow down possibilities.  
Good next letters to test: I, N, T, L, C, D, M, etc.

A strong candidate is ""AUDIO"" – but it contains O, which we already know is not in the word.  
Another candidate: ""ADMIT"" – but it has I and T, which are good, and M and D are also good.  
Another: ""ALBUM"" – but it has U and M, which are okay, but B is less common.  
Another: ""ANVIL"" – but it has N, V, I, L – but V is less common.  
Another: ""AMBIT"" – but it has M, B, I, T – B is less common.  
Another: ""ADMIT"" seems best – A✓, D, M, I, T are all new letters and common.

But wait: ""ADMIT"" has A✓, D, M, I, T – but we know A is fixed in first position, so the word is A D M I T.  
Let me check if ADMIT is a valid 5-letter word – yes, it is.

So my next guess is ADMIT.

<guess>ADMIT</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADMIT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(x) M(x) I(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word starts with A.
2. Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, D, M, T.
3. I is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was marked “-” in ADMIT).

So the pattern is:
A _ _ _ _

and the remaining letters we can still use are:
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
plus the known letter I, which must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.

I want a word that:
- starts with A,
- contains I (but not in position 4),
- uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Good candidates:
- ALINE (but N is okay, L is okay, I is okay, E is eliminated) → invalid (E).
- ALIBI (but B and I are okay, but double I may not help).
- ACHIN (but C and H and N are okay, but I is in position 3).
- ANVIL (but V and L are okay, but N and I are okay, and I is in position 4 – eliminated).
- AUKIN (but U and K and N are okay, I is in position 4 – eliminated).
- AGILE (but G, L, E – E is eliminated).
- ACHIL (but C, H, L are okay, I is in position 3).

The best seems ACHIL, but it’s not a common word.  
Another: ALINE is invalid (E).  
Another: ALIBI is possible, but B is less common.  
Another: ANVIL is invalid (I in position 4).  
Another: ACHIN is valid, but C, H, I, N are all new letters.

But wait – ACHIN is a valid 5-letter word meaning “the act of eating.”  
It fits all constraints:
- A✓ in position 1.
- Contains I (position 3).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

So I’ll guess ACHIN.

The only valid words left seem to be:
- AIFUL
- AILLY
- AILUK
- AIGUI

Among these, ""AIFUL"" is the most common English word (though rare). ""AIGUI"" is not a standard word. ""AILLY"" is a proper noun (name). ""AILUK"" is not standard.

The best remaining common word is ""AIFUL"" (a variant spelling of ""afoul"" or a name).

But let me double-check for any other possibilities:

- AVIOL – not standard.

So ""AIFUL"" is the only valid remaining word fitting all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters to maximize the information gained from the feedback.

One of the best starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and each letter is unique, giving maximum coverage. This will help me quickly determine which of these common letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of E and S, which are particularly common. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in the first position (A✓).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all (x).

So the pattern is:
A _ _ _ _

We need a 5-letter word starting with A that does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.  
Letters we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I want a word that introduces several new common letters to narrow down possibilities.  
Good next letters to test: I, N, T, L, C, D, M, etc.

A strong candidate is ""AUDIO"" – but it contains O, which we already know is not in the word.  
Another candidate: ""ADMIT"" – but it has I and T, which are good, and M and D are also good.  
Another: ""ALBUM"" – but it has U and M, which are okay, but B is less common.  
Another: ""ANVIL"" – but it has N, V, I, L – but V is less common.  
Another: ""AMBIT"" – but it has M, B, I, T – B is less common.  
Another: ""ADMIT"" seems best – A✓, D, M, I, T are all new letters and common.

But wait: ""ADMIT"" has A✓, D, M, I, T – but we know A is fixed in first position, so the word is A D M I T.  
Let me check if ADMIT is a valid 5-letter word – yes, it is.

So my next guess is ADMIT.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word starts with A.
2. Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, D, M, T.
3. I is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was marked “-” in ADMIT).

So the pattern is:
A _ _ _ _

and the remaining letters we can still use are:
B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
plus the known letter I, which must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5.

I want a word that:
- starts with A,
- contains I (but not in position 4),
- uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Good candidates:
- ALINE (but N is okay, L is okay, I is okay, E is eliminated) → invalid (E).
- ALIBI (but B and I are okay, but double I may not help).
- ACHIN (but C and H and N are okay, but I is in position 3).
- ANVIL (but V and L are okay, but N and I are okay, and I is in position 4 – eliminated).
- AUKIN (but U and K and N are okay, I is in position 4 – eliminated).
- AGILE (but G, L, E – E is eliminated).
- ACHIL (but C, H, L are okay, I is in position 3).

The best seems ACHIL, but it’s not a common word.  
Another: ALINE is invalid (E).  
Another: ALIBI is possible, but B is less common.  
Another: ANVIL is invalid (I in position 4).  
Another: ACHIN is valid, but C, H, I, N are all new letters.

But wait – ACHIN is a valid 5-letter word meaning “the act of eating.”  
It fits all constraints:
- A✓ in position 1.
- Contains I (position 3).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

So I’ll guess ACHIN.

From the new feedback on AIFUL:

- A(✓)  – still correct in position 1.
- I(-)  – I is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- F(x)  – F is not in the word.
- U(x)  – U is not in the word.
- L(-)  – L is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we know:
- Pattern: A _ _ _ _
- I must be in position 3 or 4.
- L must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
- Eliminated letters: R, O, S, E, D, M, T, C, H, N, F, U.

Remaining usable letters (excluding A, I, L and the eliminated ones):
B, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word starting with A, containing I and L (each in positions 2-4), and using only the remaining letters.

Possible patterns:
- A I L _ _
- A L I _ _
- A _ I L _
- A _ _ I L
- A _ L I _

Let’s list valid words fitting these patterns:
- A I L _ _ : AILIN (not standard), AILIS (not standard)
- A L I _ _ : ALIBI (B, I – B is okay, but I is in position 3, L in position 2 – both allowed)
- A _ I L _ : A _ I L _ – need a letter in position 2 and 5. Possible: A B I L K (not standard), A G I L K (not standard)
- A _ _ I L : A _ _ I L – need letters in positions 2,3. Possible: A B G I L (not standard), A K I L Y (not standard)

The only standard word fitting is ALIBI:
- A L I B I
- A(✓), L(-) – L is in position 2 (allowed), I(-) – I is in position 3 (allowed), B is new and allowed.

Let’s verify:
- A L I B I
- A(✓) – correct
- L(-) – L is in word but not position 5 (it’s in position 2) – OK
- I(-) – I is in word but not position 2 (it’s in position 3) – OK
- B – new letter, not eliminated
- I – already known to be in word

This fits all constraints.
