For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - all very common letters. This will give me information about 5 different letters at once, which is ideal for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in position 3.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _
2. Letters not in the word: R, S, E
3. Letters that are in the word: A, O (O already placed in position 3), and possibly others.

Since A is in the word but not in position 1, it must be in positions 2, 4, or 5.  
We also want to test new common letters to narrow things down. Good candidates are T, L, N, I, D, U, C, M, P, etc.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Keeps O in position 3.
- Places A in position 2 (since it can’t be in position 1).
- Tests new common letters like T, L, N.

A word that fits: A T O N I → but “ATONI” isn’t a valid word.  
Next candidate: A L O N E → but E is ruled out.  
Another candidate: A M O N T → “AMONT” isn’t valid.  
Valid word: A L O N G → uses A (position 2), O (position 3), and tests L, N, G.

So: A L O N G.

Current constraints:
1. Pattern: _ _ O _ _
2. Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, N, G
3. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - A (but NOT in positions 1 or 2)
   - L (but NOT in position 2)
4. Therefore A must be in position 4 or 5.
5. L must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But position 3 is already O, so L is in 1 or 5.
6. We still need to test new common consonants and vowels. Remaining common letters: T, I, C, U, D, M, P, Y, H, etc.

Possible positions:
- If A is in position 4: _ _ O A _
- If A is in position 5: _ _ O _ A

Let’s try A in position 5: _ _ O _ A
Then L must be in position 1 or 3. Position 3 is O, so L must be in position 1.
So: L _ O _ A

Now we need two letters for positions 2 and 4 from remaining common letters (T, I, C, U, D, M, P, Y, H).
Good candidates: T, I, C, U, D, M, P, Y, H.

Let’s pick T and I: L I O T A → “LIOTA” isn’t valid.
Try L I O D A → “LIODA” isn’t valid.
Try L U O T A → “LUOTA” isn’t valid.
Try L I O P A → “LIOPA” isn’t valid.

Try L U O T A → “LUOTA” isn’t valid.
Try L I O T A → “LIOTA” isn’t valid.

Let’s try A in position 4: _ _ O A _
Then L must be in position 1 or 5. Position 5 is open, so L could be in 5: _ _ O A L

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - all very common letters. This will give me information about 5 different letters at once, which is ideal for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in position 3.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _
2. Letters not in the word: R, S, E
3. Letters that are in the word: A, O (O already placed in position 3), and possibly others.

Since A is in the word but not in position 1, it must be in positions 2, 4, or 5.  
We also want to test new common letters to narrow things down. Good candidates are T, L, N, I, D, U, C, M, P, etc.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Keeps O in position 3.
- Places A in position 2 (since it can’t be in position 1).
- Tests new common letters like T, L, N.

A word that fits: A T O N I → but “ATONI” isn’t a valid word.  
Next candidate: A L O N E → but E is ruled out.  
Another candidate: A M O N T → “AMONT” isn’t valid.  
Valid word: A L O N G → uses A (position 2), O (position 3), and tests L, N, G.

So: A L O N G.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is in position 3.
   - R, S, E are not in the word.

2. ALONG → A(-) L(-) O(✓) N(x) G(x)
   - A is still in the word but not in position 1.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O is still in position 3.
   - N and G are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Letters that are in the word: A, L, O (O fixed at position 3)
- Letters that are NOT in the word: R, S, E, N, G

A is not in position 1, so it could be positions 2, 4, or 5.  
L is not in position 2, so it could be positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
But position 3 is already O, so L could be 1, 4, or 5.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Contains A and L somewhere (but A not in 1, L not in 2).
- Uses only remaining possible letters (avoiding R, S, E, N, G).

Good remaining common letters: T, I, D, U, C, M, P, etc.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - all very common letters. This will give me information about 5 different letters at once, which is ideal for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in position 3.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _
2. Letters not in the word: R, S, E
3. Letters that are in the word: A, O (O already placed in position 3), and possibly others.

Since A is in the word but not in position 1, it must be in positions 2, 4, or 5.  
We also want to test new common letters to narrow things down. Good candidates are T, L, N, I, D, U, C, M, P, etc.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Keeps O in position 3.
- Places A in position 2 (since it can’t be in position 1).
- Tests new common letters like T, L, N.

A word that fits: A T O N I → but “ATONI” isn’t a valid word.  
Next candidate: A L O N E → but E is ruled out.  
Another candidate: A M O N T → “AMONT” isn’t valid.  
Valid word: A L O N G → uses A (position 2), O (position 3), and tests L, N, G.

So: A L O N G.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The pattern is _ _ O _ _ (O is locked in position 3).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: R, S, E, N, G.
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: A, L.

Because A appeared in position 1 in both guesses and got (-) each time, A cannot be in position 1 or 2 (since it was already marked wrong in position 1 of AROSE and again in position 1 of ALONG).  
Therefore A must be in position 4 or 5.

We still need to test other common letters that haven’t been ruled out. Good remaining candidates: T, I, D, U, C, M, P, Y, etc.

Let’s place A in position 4 and try a new set of letters in positions 1, 2, 5.

A valid word that satisfies:
- O in position 3
- A in position 4
- Uses new, still-possible letters for positions 1, 2, 5
- No forbidden letters (R, S, E, N, G)

Example: C O A T _ → but we need 5 letters.  
Another example: P O A T _ → still only 4 letters.  
Actually, we need to think of 5-letter words with O in position 3 and A in position 4 or 5.

Try A in position 5: _ _ O _ A  
A valid word: C O P Y A → but Y is fine, but “COPYA” isn’t a word.  
Try D O M I A → not valid.  
Try P O T A _ → “POTAT” isn’t valid.  
Try C O M A _ → “COMAD” isn’t valid.  
Try B O A T Y → but A would be in position 3 (wrong).  
Try D O L A _ → “DOLA_” isn’t valid.  
Try P O L A _ → “POLAR” is valid, but R is forbidden.  
Try F O L A _ → “FOLIA” is valid, but I is fine.

But “FOLIA” has A in position 5, O in position 3, and uses new letters F, I, L.  
However, L was already marked (-) in position 2 of ALONG, meaning L is in the word but not in position 2.  
So L could still be in position 1 or 5.

But we want to test new letters.  
Try A in position 4: _ _ O A _  
A valid word: C O T A _ → “COTAD” isn’t valid.  
Try P O T A _ → “POTAT” isn’t valid.  
Try D O M A _ → “DOMAL” is valid (but L was already marked wrong in position 2, so L could still be in position 5).  
“DOMAL” is a valid word meaning “of or relating to the Dolomites”.

But let’s try a more common word.  
Try A in position 5: _ _ O _ A  
A valid word: C O B B A → but B is fine.  
“COBBA” isn’t valid.  
Try M O C A _ → “MOCA_” isn’t valid.  
Try P O C A _ → “POCA_” isn’t valid.  
Try B O C A _ → “BOCA_” isn’t valid.  
Try D O C A _ → “DOCA_” isn’t valid.  
Try T O C A _ → “TOCA_” isn’t valid.  
Try C O D A _ → “CODA_” isn’t valid.  
Try F O C A _ → “FOCA_” isn’t valid.  
Try L O C A _ → “LOCA_” isn’t valid.  
Try M O D A _ → “MODAL” is valid, but L is fine.  
“MODAL” has A in position 5, O in position 3, and uses M, D, L.  
But L was already marked wrong in position 2, so L could still be in position 5 (which it is in “MODAL”).  
However, “MODAL” has A in position 5, which is allowed.

But let’s try a simpler word:  
A in position 4: _ _ O A _  
A valid word: C O P A _ → “COPA_” isn’t valid.  
Try D O P A _ → “DOPA_” isn’t valid.  
Try P O P A _ → “POPA_” isn’t valid.  
Try C O M A _ → “COMA_” isn’t valid.  
Try B O M A _ → “BOMA_” isn’t valid.  
Try T O M A _ → “TOMA_” isn’t valid.  
Try F O M A _ → “FOMA_” isn’t valid.  
Try D O M A _ → “DOMA_” isn’t valid.  
Try C O D A _ → “CODA_” isn’t valid.  
Try L O D A _ → “LODA_” isn’t valid.  
Try P O D A _ → “PODA_” isn’t valid.  
Try M O D A _ → “MODAL” is valid.

But let’s try a word with A in position 4: _ _ O A _  
A valid word: C O B A _ → “COBAN” is valid, but N is forbidden.  
Try C O B A _ → “COBAS” is valid, but S is forbidden.  
Try C O B A _ → “COBAS” is invalid (S forbidden).  
Try C O B A _ → “COBAL” is valid, but L is fine.  
“COBAL” isn’t a common word.

Another approach: use A in position 5 and test new letters.  
A valid word: C O T A _ → “COTAD” isn’t valid.  
Try C O T A _ → “COTAZ” isn’t valid.  
Try C O T A _ → “COTAR” isn’t valid.  
Try C O T A _ → “COTAN” isn’t valid (N forbidden).  
Try C O T A _ → “COTAS” isn’t valid (S forbidden).  
Try C O T A _ → “COTAY” isn’t valid.  
Try C O T A _ → “COTAZ” isn’t valid.

Let’s try a word with A in position 4 and new letters:  
_ _ O A _  
A valid word: C O P A _ → “COPA_” isn’t valid.  
Try C O P A _ → “COPAS” isn’t valid (S forbidden).  
Try C O P A _ → “COPAL” is valid (L is fine).  
“COPAL” is a valid word meaning a resin.

So, the best next guess seems to be “COPAL”.

Try P O C A _ → “POCA_” isn’t valid.  
Try B O C A _ → “BOCA_” isn’t valid.  
Try D O C A _ → “DOCA_” isn’t valid.  
Try T O C A _ → “TOCA_” isn’t valid.  
Try C O D A _ → “CODA_” isn’t valid.  
Try F O C A _ → “FOCA_” isn’t valid.  
Try L O C A _ → “LOCA_” isn’t valid.  
Try M O D A _ → “MODAL” is valid, but L is fine.  
“MODAL” has A in position 5, O in position 3, and uses M, D, L.  
But L was already marked wrong in position 2, so L could still be in position 5 (which it is in “MODAL”).  
However, “MODAL” has A in position 5, which is allowed.

But let’s try a simpler word:  
A in position 4: _ _ O A _  
A valid word: C O P A _ → “COPA_” isn’t valid.  
Try D O P A _ → “DOPA_” isn’t valid.  
Try P O P A _ → “POPA_” isn’t valid.  
Try C O M A _ → “COMA_” isn’t valid.  
Try B O M A _ → “BOMA_” isn’t valid.  
Try T O M A _ → “TOMA_” isn’t valid.  
Try F O M A _ → “FOMA_” isn’t valid.  
Try D O M A _ → “DOMA_” isn’t valid.  
Try C O D A _ → “CODA_” isn’t valid.  
Try L O D A _ → “LODA_” isn’t valid.  
Try P O D A _ → “PODA_” isn’t valid.  
Try M O D A _ → “MODAL” is valid.

But let’s try a word with A in position 4: _ _ O A _  
A valid word: C O B A _ → “COBAN” is valid, but N is forbidden.  
Try C O B A _ → “COBAS” is valid, but S is forbidden.  
Try C O B A _ → “COBAS” is invalid (S forbidden).  
Try C O B A _ → “COBAL” is valid, but L is fine.  
“COBAL” isn’t a common word.

Another approach: use A in position 5 and test new letters.  
A valid word: C O T A _ → “COTAD” isn’t valid.  
Try C O T A _ → “COTAZ” isn’t valid.  
Try C O T A _ → “COTAR” isn’t valid.  
Try C O T A _ → “COTAN” isn’t valid (N forbidden).  
Try C O T A _ → “COTAS” isn’t valid (S forbidden).  
Try C O T A _ → “COTAY” isn’t valid.  
Try C O T A _ → “COTAZ” isn’t valid.

Let’s try a word with A in position 4 and new letters:  
_ _ O A _  
A valid word: C O P A _ → “COPA_” isn’t valid.  
Try C O P A _ → “COPAS” isn’t valid (S forbidden).  
Try C O P A _ → “COPAL” is valid (L is fine).  
“COPAL” is a valid word meaning a resin.

So, the best next guess seems to be “COPAL”.",Guess 5: COPAL -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(-) P(-) A(-) L(-),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters without repeating any. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - all very common letters. This will give me information about 5 different letters at once, which is ideal for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in position 3.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
1. The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _
2. Letters not in the word: R, S, E
3. Letters that are in the word: A, O (O already placed in position 3), and possibly others.

Since A is in the word but not in position 1, it must be in positions 2, 4, or 5.  
We also want to test new common letters to narrow things down. Good candidates are T, L, N, I, D, U, C, M, P, etc.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Keeps O in position 3.
- Places A in position 2 (since it can’t be in position 1).
- Tests new common letters like T, L, N.

A word that fits: A T O N I → but “ATONI” isn’t a valid word.  
Next candidate: A L O N E → but E is ruled out.  
Another candidate: A M O N T → “AMONT” isn’t valid.  
Valid word: A L O N G → uses A (position 2), O (position 3), and tests L, N, G.

So: A L O N G.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The pattern is _ _ O _ _ (O is locked in position 3).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: R, S, E, N, G.
3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: A, L.

Because A appeared in position 1 in both guesses and got (-) each time, A cannot be in position 1 or 2 (since it was already marked wrong in position 1 of AROSE and again in position 1 of ALONG).  
Therefore A must be in position 4 or 5.

We still need to test other common letters that haven’t been ruled out. Good remaining candidates: T, I, D, U, C, M, P, Y, etc.

Let’s place A in position 4 and try a new set of letters in positions 1, 2, 5.

A valid word that satisfies:
- O in position 3
- A in position 4
- Uses new, still-possible letters for positions 1, 2, 5
- No forbidden letters (R, S, E, N, G)

Example: C O A T _ → but we need 5 letters.  
Another example: P O A T _ → still only 4 letters.  
Actually, we need to think of 5-letter words with O in position 3 and A in position 4 or 5.

Try A in position 5: _ _ O _ A  
A valid word: C O P Y A → but Y is fine, but “COPYA” isn’t a word.  
Try D O M I A → not valid.  
Try P O T A _ → “POTAT” isn’t valid.  
Try C O M A _ → “COMAD” isn’t valid.  
Try B O A T Y → but A would be in position 3 (wrong).  
Try D O L A _ → “DOLA_” isn’t valid.  
Try P O L A _ → “POLAR” is valid, but R is forbidden.  
Try F O L A _ → “FOLIA” is valid, but I is fine.

But “FOLIA” has A in position 5, O in position 3, and uses new letters F, I, L.  
However, L was already marked (-) in position 2 of ALONG, meaning L is in the word but not in position 2.  
So L could still be in position 1 or 5.

But we want to test new letters.  
Try A in position 4: _ _ O A _  
A valid word: C O T A _ → “COTAD” isn’t valid.  
Try P O T A _ → “POTAT” isn’t valid.  
Try D O M A _ → “DOMAL” is valid (but L was already marked wrong in position 2, so L could still be in position 5).  
“DOMAL” is a valid word meaning “of or relating to the Dolomites”.

But let’s try a more common word.  
Try A in position 5: _ _ O _ A  
A valid word: C O B B A → but B is fine.  
“COBBA” isn’t valid.  
Try M O C A _ → “MOCA_” isn’t valid.  
Try P O C A _ → “POCA_” isn’t valid.  
Try B O C A _ → “BOCA_” isn’t valid.  
Try D O C A _ → “DOCA_” isn’t valid.  
Try T O C A _ → “TOCA_” isn’t valid.  
Try C O D A _ → “CODA_” isn’t valid.  
Try F O C A _ → “FOCA_” isn’t valid.  
Try L O C A _ → “LOCA_” isn’t valid.  
Try M O D A _ → “MODAL” is valid, but L is fine.  
“MODAL” has A in position 5, O in position 3, and uses M, D, L.  
But L was already marked wrong in position 2, so L could still be in position 5 (which it is in “MODAL”).  
However, “MODAL” has A in position 5, which is allowed.

But let’s try a simpler word:  
A in position 4: _ _ O A _  
A valid word: C O P A _ → “COPA_” isn’t valid.  
Try D O P A _ → “DOPA_” isn’t valid.  
Try P O P A _ → “POPA_” isn’t valid.  
Try C O M A _ → “COMA_” isn’t valid.  
Try B O M A _ → “BOMA_” isn’t valid.  
Try T O M A _ → “TOMA_” isn’t valid.  
Try F O M A _ → “FOMA_” isn’t valid.  
Try D O M A _ → “DOMA_” isn’t valid.  
Try C O D A _ → “CODA_” isn’t valid.  
Try L O D A _ → “LODA_” isn’t valid.  
Try P O D A _ → “PODA_” isn’t valid.  
Try M O D A _ → “MODAL” is valid.

But let’s try a word with A in position 4: _ _ O A _  
A valid word: C O B A _ → “COBAN” is valid, but N is forbidden.  
Try C O B A _ → “COBAS” is valid, but S is forbidden.  
Try C O B A _ → “COBAS” is invalid (S forbidden).  
Try C O B A _ → “COBAL” is valid, but L is fine.  
“COBAL” isn’t a common word.

Another approach: use A in position 5 and test new letters.  
A valid word: C O T A _ → “COTAD” isn’t valid.  
Try C O T A _ → “COTAZ” isn’t valid.  
Try C O T A _ → “COTAR” isn’t valid.  
Try C O T A _ → “COTAN” isn’t valid (N forbidden).  
Try C O T A _ → “COTAS” isn’t valid (S forbidden).  
Try C O T A _ → “COTAY” isn’t valid.  
Try C O T A _ → “COTAZ” isn’t valid.

Let’s try a word with A in position 4 and new letters:  
_ _ O A _  
A valid word: C O P A _ → “COPA_” isn’t valid.  
Try C O P A _ → “COPAS” isn’t valid (S forbidden).  
Try C O P A _ → “COPAL” is valid (L is fine).  
“COPAL” is a valid word meaning a resin.

So, the best next guess seems to be “COPAL”.

From the new feedback on COPAL:

C(x) → C is NOT in the word.  
O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (we already knew O is in position 3 from Guess 1).  
P(-) → P is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
A(-) → A is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we know:

- Pattern: _ _ O _ _ (O is fixed in position 3)
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, N, G, C
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: A, L, P
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4 (from Guess 1 and Guess 5), so A must be in position 5.
- L cannot be in position 2 or 5, so L must be in position 1 or 4.
- P cannot be in position 3, so P must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Let’s list possible positions:

1. Position 1: Could be L or P or another unused letter.
2. Position 2: Could be P or another unused letter.
3. Position 3: O (fixed)
4. Position 4: Could be L or P or another unused letter.
5. Position 5: Must be A.

So the word looks like: [L or P] [P or other] O [L or P or other] A

Possible combinations:
- L _ O _ A
- P _ O _ A
