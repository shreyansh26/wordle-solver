For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters without repeating any. 

Popular strategic starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give us good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and L, but S is not first and L is not second.
- Does NOT contain A, T, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has S and L somewhere in positions 2-5 (since S is not first, L is not second).
2. Avoids A, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters we haven’t tested yet (R, N, I, O, U, C, etc.).

A good next guess should place S and L in new positions and introduce new common letters. Let’s try “FLUNK”:
- F, U, N, K are new letters.
- S is in position 4 (not 1, so allowed).
- L is in position 2 (allowed, since L was only marked wrong at position 2 in SLATE, but here it’s in position 2 again—wait, that’s the same position as before! We need to avoid that.)

Better: “FLUSH”:
- F, U, S, H are new letters.
- S is in position 3 (allowed).
- L is in position 2 (same as before—still bad.)

Next: “CLOPS”:
- C, O, P are new letters.
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- L is in position 2 (still same as before—bad.)

Next: “BLOBS” (invalid, repeats B and S).

Next: “SLOSH”:
- S is in position 1 (forbidden, same as before).

Next: “LIONS”:
- L is in position 1 (allowed, since feedback only said L is not in position 2).
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- I, O, N are new letters.

This seems solid:
- L in position 1 (new position).
- S in position 5 (new position).
- Introduces I, O, N which are common and untested.

Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 2).
- A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and L, but S is not first and L is not second.
- Does NOT contain A, T, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has S and L somewhere in positions 2-5 (since S is not first, L is not second).
2. Avoids A, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters we haven’t tested yet (R, N, I, O, U, C, etc.).

A good next guess should place S and L in new positions and introduce new common letters. Let’s try “FLUNK”:
- F, U, N, K are new letters.
- S is in position 4 (not 1, so allowed).
- L is in position 2 (allowed, since L was only marked wrong at position 2 in SLATE, but here it’s in position 2 again—wait, that’s the same position as before! We need to avoid that.)

Better: “FLUSH”:
- F, U, S, H are new letters.
- S is in position 3 (allowed).
- L is in position 2 (same as before—still bad.)

Next: “CLOPS”:
- C, O, P are new letters.
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- L is in position 2 (still same as before—bad.)

Next: “BLOBS” (invalid, repeats B and S).

Next: “SLOSH”:
- S is in position 1 (forbidden, same as before).

Next: “LIONS”:
- L is in position 1 (allowed, since feedback only said L is not in position 2).
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- I, O, N are new letters.

This seems solid:
- L in position 1 (new position).
- S in position 5 (new position).
- Introduces I, O, N which are common and untested.

Guess 2: LIONS -> FEEDBACK: L(-) I(x) O(x) N(x) S(✓)

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: SLATE → S(-) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
- S is in the word but not in position 1.  
- L is in the word but not in position 2.  
- A, T, E are not in the word.

Round 2: LIONS → L(-) I(x) O(x) N(x) S(✓)  
- L is still in the word but not in position 1 (so L must be in positions 2,3,4, or 5).  
- I, O, N are not in the word.  
- S is now confirmed in position 5 (✓).

So the secret word:
- Ends with S.  
- Contains L somewhere in positions 2-4.  
- Does NOT contain A, T, E, I, O, N.  

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends in S.  
2. Has L in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
3. Uses only the remaining letters.

Possible candidates:
- BLURS (B, L, U, R, S) – L in position 2, U and R are new.  
- CLASH (but A is forbidden).  
- FLURS (but F, U, R, S – L in position 2).  
- GLUMS (L in position 3, G, U, M new).  
- PLUSH (L in position 3, P, U, H new).  
- SLURS (but S is in position 1, forbidden).  

Best choice: BLURS – fits all constraints and tests new letters B, U, R.

Let's consolidate the information we now have after three guesses.

Letters known to be in the word:
- S is fixed in position 5 (✓ from BLURS).
- L is somewhere in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 5 (because in LIONS it was marked ""-"" in position 1, and in BLURS it was marked ""-"" in position 2). Therefore L must be in position 3 or 4.

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
A, T, E, I, O, N, B, R

So the word pattern is:
_ _ L _ S  or  _ _ _ L S

We need to fill positions 1, 2, 4 (or 3) with letters not yet ruled out. Allowed letters (excluding the forbidden ones) are:
C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We also know from BLURS that U is in the word but in the wrong position (it was ""-"" in position 3). Since the word ends in S, U could be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Possible patterns:
- U _ L _ S
- _ U L _ S
- _ _ _ L S with U in position 1 or 2 or 4

Let's think of 5-letter words ending in S with L in position 3 or 4 and U somewhere else.

For _ _ L _ S:
- Could be ""FLUSH"" but H is allowed, but we already know R is out and other letters. Let's think of ""CLASH"" but A is out. ""CLUMP"" but doesn't end in S. ""PLUMS"" - P, L, U, M, S. This fits:
  - P (allowed)
  - L in position 3
  - U in position 2
  - M (allowed)
  - S in position 5

This seems valid. Let's check:
PLUMS:
- P: allowed
- L: position 3 (allowed)
- U: position 2 (allowed, since U was ""-"" in position 3 in BLURS)
- M: allowed
- S: position 5 (correct)

This fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters without repeating any. 

Popular strategic starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give us good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).

2. Avoids A, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters we haven’t tested yet (R, N, I, O, U, C, etc.).

A good next guess should place S and L in new positions and introduce new common letters. Let’s try “FLUNK”:
- F, U, N, K are new letters.
- S is in position 4 (not 1, so allowed).
- L is in position 2 (allowed, since L was only marked wrong at position 2 in SLATE, but here it’s in position 2 again—wait, that’s the same position as before! We need to avoid that.)

Better: “FLUSH”:
- F, U, S, H are new letters.
- S is in position 3 (allowed).
- L is in position 2 (same as before—still bad.)

Next: “CLOPS”:

- S is in position 5 (allowed).

- S is now confirmed in position 5 (✓).

So the secret word:

- Contains L somewhere in positions 2-4.  
- Does NOT contain A, T, E, I, O, N.  

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible candidates:

- CLASH (but A is forbidden).  
- FLURS (but F, U, R, S – L in position 2).

Current state of knowledge:

Letters that are definitely in the word:
- S is fixed in position 5 (✓ from every guess).
- P is fixed in position 1 (✓ from PLUMS).

Letters that are in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- L must be in position 3 or 4 (it was ""-"" in positions 1, 2, and 5).
- U must be in the word but not in position 3 (it was ""-"" in position 3 in BLURS and PLUMS).

Letters that are NOT in the word:
A, T, E, I, O, N, B, R, M

So the word pattern is:
P _ _ _ S
with L and U still to place in positions 2, 3, or 4, and:
- L cannot be in position 2 (because in LIONS it was ""-"" in position 2).
- U cannot be in position 3 (because in BLURS it was ""-"" in position 3).

Possible positions for L: 3 or 4
Possible positions for U: 2 or 4 (but not both can be in 4, so one must be in 2 and the other in 3 or 4 accordingly)

Let's enumerate the valid patterns:

1. L in position 3:
   P _ L _ S
   U must then be in position 2 or 4
   - If U in position 2: P U L _ S → need a letter for position 4 (allowed letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z)
     Possible word: PULVS (but V is allowed) – but ""PULVS"" is not a valid English word.
     Another: PULKS – but K is allowed, ""PULKS"" is not valid.
     Another: PULGS – not valid.
     Another: PULHS – not valid.
     Another: PULDS – not valid.

     Another: PULJS – not valid.
     Another: PULQS – not valid.
     Another: PULYS – not valid.
     Another: PULVS – not valid.
     It seems no valid word here.

2. L in position 4:
   P _ _ L S
   U must then be in position 2 or 3
   - If U in position 2: P U _ L S → need a letter for position 3 (allowed letters)
     Possible word: P U C L S → ""PUCLS"" – not valid.
     P U D L S – ""PUDLS"" – not valid.

     No valid words.

Wait, let's reconsider. Maybe I missed some valid words. Let me think of real 5-letter English words that fit P _ _ _ S with L and U somewhere.

Looking at the constraints:
- P fixed at 1
- S fixed at 5
- L must be in 3 or 4
- U must be in 2 or 4 (but not 3)
- No A, T, E, I, O, N, B, R, M

Possible valid words:
- PULVS – invalid
- PULKS – invalid
- PULGS – invalid
- PULHS – invalid
- PULDS – invalid
- PULCS – invalid
- PULJS – invalid
- PULQS – invalid
- PULYS – invalid
- PULVS – invalid

Actually, let me think of ""PULPS"" – but P is already in position 1, and P is allowed to repeat? Wait, the rules don't prohibit letter repetition unless specified. But in our feedback, P was marked ✓ in position 1, so it's allowed. However, the word would be P U L P S – but L must be in 3 or 4. This seems forced.

But ""PULPS"" is a valid word (plural of pulp). Let's check:
- P (1) – ✓
- U (2) – allowed
- L (3) – allowed (must be in 3 or 4)
- P (4) – allowed
- S (5) – ✓
This fits all constraints.

Another possibility: ""PULPS"" seems the only valid word fitting the pattern.

Let's verify:
- PULPS:
  - P (1) – ✓ (from PLUMS)
  - U (2) – allowed
  - L (3) – allowed (must be in 3 or 4)
  - P (4) – allowed
  - S (5) – ✓
This satisfies every constraint.

Therefore, the next logical guess is PULPS.
