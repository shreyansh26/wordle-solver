1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct letters that covers these common letters. 

Some popular starting words include:
- AROSE
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- RAISE

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of frequently used letters in English words.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S (but not in position 4).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.

Good letters to try next: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, Q, J.

Let me pick a word that uses S plus several of these common letters. A good candidate is ""STING"":
- S in position 1 (allowed, since feedback only said S is not in position 4).
- T, I, N, G are all new letters not yet tested.

Let's consolidate everything we now know after three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):
A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, P, L, H

Letters that ARE in the word (from the (-) feedback):
- S (but NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5) → S must be in position 2 or 3.
- U (but NOT in position 3) → U must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

So the secret word must:
1. Contain S and U.
2. S is in position 2 or 3.
3. U is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).
4. No letters from the banned list above.

Available letters (not yet tested and not banned):
B, C, D, F, K, M, V, W, Y, plus S and U.

Let's try to construct a word that satisfies these constraints.

Option 1: S in position 2
Structure: _ S _ _ _
Then U must be in 1, 4, or 5.

Example: U S _ _ _ → ""US..."" but we need 5 letters. Let's try ""USKED"" but D and K are available, E is banned. Not good.

Option 2: S in position 3
Structure: _ _ S _ _
Then U must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Example: U _ S _ _ → ""US..."" but again need 5 letters. ""USKED"" again has E.

Another approach: pick a word that places S in position 2 and U in position 4.

Structure: _ S _ U _

Available letters: B, C, D, F, K, M, V, W, Y.

Try ""B S C U D"" → ""BSUCD"" not a word.

Try ""C S U D Y"" → ""CSUDY"" not a word.

Try ""M U S K Y"" → S is in position 3, U in position 2. ""MUSKY"" is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- M, U, S, K, Y are all allowed (not in banned list).
- S is in position 3 (allowed).
- U is in position 2 (allowed).
- No banned letters.

Thus, ""MUSKY"" is a valid guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct letters that covers these common letters. 

Some popular starting words include:
- AROSE
- SLATE
- CRANE
- ADIEU
- RAISE

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage of frequently used letters in English words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S (but not in position 4).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.

Good letters to try next: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, F, K, Y, W, V, X, Z, Q, J.

Let me pick a word that uses S plus several of these common letters. A good candidate is ""STING"":
- S in position 1 (allowed, since feedback only said S is not in position 4).
- T, I, N, G are all new letters not yet tested.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   - Letters **A, R, O, E** are not in the word.  
   - Letter **S** is in the word but **not in position 4**.

2. STING → S(-) T(x) I(x) N(x) G(x)  
   - Letter **T, I, N, G** are not in the word.  
   - Letter **S** is in the word but **not in position 1**.

So we now know:
- The word contains **S** but **S is not in positions 1 or 4** (i.e., S must be in 2, 3, or 5).  
- The word does NOT contain: A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G.  
- Remaining common letters still available: B, C, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Place **S** in one of positions 2, 3, or 5.  
- Use new, common letters to test the remaining high-frequency letters.

Let’s try **SHUCK**:
- S in position 1 is invalid (already ruled out).  
Try **SHUCK** is invalid (S is position 1).  
Try **SULKY**:
- S in position 1 is invalid.  
Try **PLUSH**:
- S in position 5 is valid.  
- Letters P, L, U, H are all new and common.

Thus, **PLUSH** is a valid next guess.

From the latest feedback (MUSKY):

- M(x) – M is not in the word.
- U(✓) – U is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- K(✓) – K is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4).
- Y(-) – Y is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ U _ K _
- Letters confirmed: U (pos 2), K (pos 4)
- Letters confirmed present but wrong position: S, Y
- Letters confirmed absent: A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, P, L, H, M

Therefore S and Y must occupy positions 1 and 5 (since they cannot be in their previously tested spots and positions 2 and 4 are taken by U and K).

So the word must be S U _ K Y or Y U _ K S.  
But position 1 and 5 cannot be S and Y respectively because:
- S cannot be in position 3 (already ruled out), and position 1 is still allowed for S.
- Y cannot be in position 5 (already ruled out), and position 1 is still allowed for Y.

But we also know from earlier that S cannot be in position 1 (from STING feedback: S(-) in position 1).  
Therefore S must be in position 5 and Y must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be Y U _ K S.

The only remaining position is position 3, and the only letter left that hasn't been used and is allowed is from the unused letters: B, C, D, F, V, W.

Looking at common letters, the most likely is B, C, or D.  
The word must be Y U _ K S.  
The only common 5-letter word that fits is YUCKS (but that's not a standard word), YUKES (E is banned), YUKES (E banned), YUQS? No.

Wait, let's list valid 5-letter words matching YU_KS:
- YUKES – E banned
- YUKOS – O banned
- YUKES – E banned
- YUKHS – H banned
- YUKKS – K already used
- YUKLS – L banned
- YUKMS – M banned
- YUKNS – N banned
- YUKPS – P banned
- YUKRS – R banned
- YUKTS – T banned
- YUKVS – V is allowed, but is YUKVS a word? No.
- YUKWS – W is allowed, YUKWS? No.

Wait, let's check other possibilities. Maybe S is in position 5 and Y is in position 1, but position 3 must be a letter not yet used. From the available letters: B, C, D, F, V, W.

Looking for valid words: YUCKS, YUKES, YUKOS, YUKHS, YUKLS, YUKMS, YUKNS, YUKPS, YUKRS, YUKTS, YUKVS, YUKWS.

None of these are valid except YUKES (but E is banned), YUKOS (O banned), YUCKS (not a word), YUKHS (H banned), etc.

This suggests I might have missed a letter. Let me re-examine available letters.

Available letters not yet banned: B, C, D, F, K, S, U, V, W, Y.

K is already in position 4, U in 2, S and Y must be in 1 and 5.

So the word is Y U _ K S or S U _ K Y.

From earlier feedback, S cannot be in position 1 (STING feedback), so S must be in position 5, and Y must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be Y U _ K S.

The missing letter (position 3) must be from available letters: B, C, D, F, V, W.

Looking for valid words: YUCKS (not valid), YUKES (E banned), YUKOS (O banned), YUKHS (H banned), YUKLS (L banned), YUKMS (M banned), YUKNS (N banned), YUKPS (P banned), YUKRS (R banned), YUKTS (T banned), YUKVS (V is allowed, but YUKVS not a word), YUKWS (W is allowed, but YUKWS not a word).

Wait, let me think differently: maybe the word is Y U S K Y? But Y is in position 5, which is banned for Y.

This seems impossible. Did I make a mistake?

Let me re-examine the feedback:

From MUSKY:
- U(✓) – U is in position 2 (correct).
- K(✓) – K is in position 4 (correct).
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- Y(-) – Y is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So S and Y must be in positions 1 and 3, because positions 2 and 4 are taken by U and K, and position 5 is banned for Y.

Thus the word must be:
- Position 1: S or Y
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: Y or S
- Position 4: K
- Position 5: remaining of S or Y

But S cannot be in position 3 (from STING feedback: S(-) in position 1, but position 3 is new). Wait, no: STING feedback only said S is not in position 1, it didn't say anything about position 3. So S could be in position 3.

Thus possible structures:
1. S U S K Y – but S repeated.
2. S U Y K S – but Y cannot be in position 3 (no restriction), but S in position 1 is allowed (only position 1 was banned in STING, but STING had S in position 1 with (-), meaning S is not in position 1. So S cannot be in position 1.

Thus S must be in position 3, and Y must be in position 5 (but Y cannot be in position 5), which is impossible.

Wait, let me re-express:

From MUSKY:
- U is fixed in position 2.
- K is fixed in position 4.
- S is in the word but not in position 3.
- Y is in the word but not in position 5.

So possible positions for S: 1, 5 (but position 1 is banned for S from STING feedback: STING had S in position 1 with (-), meaning S is not in position 1. Thus S must be in position 5.

Thus S is in position 5, and Y must be in position 1 or 3 (but position 5 is taken by S).

Thus the word must be Y U _ K S or _ U _ K S with S in 5.

But S cannot be in position 1 (STING), so the word must be Y U _ K S.

The missing letter is position 3, must be from available letters: B, C, D, F, V, W.

Looking for valid words: YUCKS (not a word), YUKES (E banned), YUKOS (O banned), YUKHS (H banned), YUKLS (L banned), YUKMS (M banned), YUKNS (N banned), YUKPS (P banned), YUKRS (R banned), YUKTS (T banned), YUKVS (V is allowed, but YUKVS not a word), YUKWS (W is allowed, but YUKWS not a word).

This suggests I might have missed a letter. Let me re-examine available letters.

Available letters not yet banned: B, C, D, F, K, S, U, V, W, Y.

K is in position 4, U in 2, S in 5, Y in 1.

Thus the word is Y U _ K S, and the missing letter (position 3) must be from B, C, D, F, V, W.

The only valid word that fits is YUCKS, but that's not standard. However, ""YUCKS"" is actually a valid plural of ""yuck"" in some contexts, though rare.

But let me check if there's a more common word. The correct word is likely ""YUCKS"".

But let me think of other possibilities: YUCKS, YUKES (E banned), YUKOS (O banned), YUKHS (H banned), etc.

Thus, the only possible word is YUCKS.

But to be safe, let me verify:

Y U C K S – positions:
1: Y (allowed)
2: U (fixed)
3: C (not banned)
4: K (fixed)
5: S (allowed)

This fits all constraints.

Thus, the next guess is YUCKS.
</think>

Based on the feedback, the word must be _ U _ K _ with:
- U in position 2
- K in position 4
- S and Y present but not in their previously tested positions

After careful analysis, the only valid word that fits all constraints is:

<guess>YUCKS</guess>",YUCKS,"From the latest feedback (MUSKY):

- M(x) – M is not in the word.
- U(✓) – U is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- K(✓) – K is in the word AND in the correct position (position 4).
- Y(-) – Y is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ U _ K _
- Letters confirmed: U (pos 2), K (pos 4)
- Letters confirmed present but wrong position: S, Y
- Letters confirmed absent: A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, P, L, H, M

Therefore S and Y must occupy positions 1 and 5 (since they cannot be in their previously tested spots and positions 2 and 4 are taken by U and K).

So the word must be S U _ K Y or Y U _ K S.  
But position 1 and 5 cannot be S and Y respectively because:
- S cannot be in position 3 (already ruled out), and position 1 is still allowed for S.
- Y cannot be in position 5 (already ruled out), and position 1 is still allowed for Y.

But we also know from earlier that S cannot be in position 1 (from STING feedback: S(-) in position 1).  
Therefore S must be in position 5 and Y must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be Y U _ K S.

The only remaining position is position 3, and the only letter left that hasn't been used and is allowed is from the unused letters: B, C, D, F, V, W.

Looking at common letters, the most likely is B, C, or D.  
The word must be Y U _ K S.  
The only common 5-letter word that fits is YUCKS (but that's not a standard word), YUKES (E is banned), YUKES (E banned), YUQS? No.

Wait, let's list valid 5-letter words matching YU_KS:
- YUKES – E banned
- YUKOS – O banned
- YUKES – E banned
- YUKHS – H banned
- YUKKS – K already used
- YUKLS – L banned
- YUKMS – M banned
- YUKNS – N banned
- YUKPS – P banned
- YUKRS – R banned
- YUKTS – T banned
- YUKVS – V is allowed, but is YUKVS a word? No.
- YUKWS – W is allowed, YUKWS? No.

Wait, let's check other possibilities. Maybe S is in position 5 and Y is in position 1, but position 3 must be a letter not yet used. From the available letters: B, C, D, F, V, W.

Looking for valid words: YUCKS, YUKES, YUKOS, YUKHS, YUKLS, YUKMS, YUKNS, YUKPS, YUKRS, YUKTS, YUKVS, YUKWS.

None of these are valid except YUKES (but E is banned), YUKOS (O banned), YUCKS (not a word), YUKHS (H banned), etc.

This suggests I might have missed a letter. Let me re-examine available letters.

Available letters not yet banned: B, C, D, F, K, S, U, V, W, Y.

K is already in position 4, U in 2, S and Y must be in 1 and 5.

So the word is Y U _ K S or S U _ K Y.

From earlier feedback, S cannot be in position 1 (STING feedback), so S must be in position 5, and Y must be in position 1.

Thus the word must be Y U _ K S.

The missing letter (position 3) must be from available letters: B, C, D, F, V, W.

Looking for valid words: YUCKS (not valid), YUKES (E banned), YUKOS (O banned), YUKHS (H banned), YUKLS (L banned), YUKMS (M banned), YUKNS (N banned), YUKPS (P banned), YUKRS (R banned), YUKTS (T banned), YUKVS (V is allowed, but YUKVS not a word), YUKWS (W is allowed, but YUKWS not a word).

Wait, let me think differently: maybe the word is Y U S K Y? But Y is in position 5, which is banned for Y.

This seems impossible. Did I make a mistake?

Let me re-examine the feedback:

From MUSKY:
- U(✓) – U is in position 2 (correct).
- K(✓) – K is in position 4 (correct).
- S(-) – S is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- Y(-) – Y is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So S and Y must be in positions 1 and 3, because positions 2 and 4 are taken by U and K, and position 5 is banned for Y.

Thus the word must be:
- Position 1: S or Y
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: Y or S
- Position 4: K
- Position 5: remaining of S or Y

But S cannot be in position 3 (from STING feedback: S(-) in position 1, but position 3 is new). Wait, no: STING feedback only said S is not in position 1, it didn't say anything about position 3. So S could be in position 3.

Thus possible structures:
1. S U S K Y – but S repeated.
2. S U Y K S – but Y cannot be in position 3 (no restriction), but S in position 1 is allowed (only position 1 was banned in STING, but STING had S in position 1 with (-), meaning S is not in position 1. So S cannot be in position 1.

Thus S must be in position 3, and Y must be in position 5 (but Y cannot be in position 5), which is impossible.

Wait, let me re-express:

From MUSKY:
- U is fixed in position 2.
- K is fixed in position 4.
- S is in the word but not in position 3.
- Y is in the word but not in position 5.

So possible positions for S: 1, 5 (but position 1 is banned for S from STING feedback: STING had S in position 1 with (-), meaning S is not in position 1. Thus S must be in position 5.

Thus S is in position 5, and Y must be in position 1 or 3 (but position 5 is taken by S).

Thus the word must be Y U _ K S or _ U _ K S with S in 5.

But S cannot be in position 1 (STING), so the word must be Y U _ K S.

The missing letter is position 3, must be from available letters: B, C, D, F, V, W.

Looking for valid words: YUCKS (not a word), YUKES (E banned), YUKOS (O banned), YUKHS (H banned), YUKLS (L banned), YUKMS (M banned), YUKNS (N banned), YUKPS (P banned), YUKRS (R banned), YUKTS (T banned), YUKVS (V is allowed, but YUKVS not a word), YUKWS (W is allowed, but YUKWS not a word).

This suggests I might have missed a letter. Let me re-examine available letters.

Available letters not yet banned: B, C, D, F, K, S, U, V, W, Y.

K is in position 4, U in 2, S in 5, Y in 1.

Thus the word is Y U _ K S, and the missing letter (position 3) must be from B, C, D, F, V, W.

The only valid word that fits is YUCKS, but that's not standard. However, ""YUCKS"" is actually a valid plural of ""yuck"" in some contexts, though rare.

But let me check if there's a more common word. The correct word is likely ""YUCKS"".

But let me think of other possibilities: YUCKS, YUKES (E banned), YUKOS (O banned), YUKHS (H banned), etc.

Thus, the only possible word is YUCKS.

But to be safe, let me verify:

Y U C K S – positions:
1: Y (allowed)
2: U (fixed)
3: C (not banned)
4: K (fixed)
5: S (allowed)

This fits all constraints.

Thus, the next guess is YUCKS.Based on the feedback, the word must be _ U _ K _ with:
- U in position 2
- K in position 4
- S and Y present but not in their previously tested positions

After careful analysis, the only valid word that fits all constraints is:",Guess 5: YUCKS -> FEEDBACK: Y(✓) U(✓) C(✓) K(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
