For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these letters without repeating any. 

One strong choice is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This should give good coverage across the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities based on the feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 1).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 2).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently in position 3).
- T is NOT in the word.
- E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains S, L, A, but not in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.
- Does NOT contain T or E.

Since S, L, A must appear somewhere in the word, and we know their current positions are wrong, we need to rearrange them.

Possible positions for S: 2,3,4,5
Possible positions for L: 1,3,4,5
Possible positions for A: 1,2,4,5

We also need two more letters (since it’s 5 letters total) that are not T or E, and ideally common consonants/vowels.

A good next word would re-use S, L, A in different positions and introduce new common letters. Let’s try “SALAD” – but that repeats A. Instead, try “SALON” – but N is less common. “SALSA” repeats S and A. 

Better: “ALARM” – but repeats A and M. 

How about “PLANS”? Let’s check:
- P, N are new letters.
- Uses A, L, S in new positions:
  - A is now in position 2 (was 3).
  - L is now in position 3 (was 2).
  - S is now in position 5 (was 1).

This seems valid and introduces P and N, which are common consonants. 

Another option: “LASER” – but E is excluded. 

“SALON” – but O is a vowel we haven’t tested yet. 

“PLANS” seems the most balanced.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are in the word:
   - S (from SLATE) – confirmed in position 5 (from PLANS feedback: S(✓)).
   - L (from SLATE) – in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.
   - A (from SLATE) – in the word but not in positions 3.
   - P (from PLANS) – in the word but not in position 1.
   - N is NOT in the word.

2. Letters NOT in the word:
   - T, E, N.

3. Positions we have ruled out:
   - S must be in position 5.
   - L cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
   - A cannot be in position 3.
   - P cannot be in position 1.

4. We still need three more distinct letters (since S, L, A, P are already accounted for), none of which are T, E, or N.

Let’s map possible positions:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Known:     _ _ _ _ S

Letters left to place: L, A, P plus two new letters.

L can be in 1, 4, or 5 (but 5 is S), so 1 or 4.
A can be in 1, 2, 4 (cannot be 3 or 5).
P can be in 2, 3, 4 (cannot be 1).

We need to assign L, A, P to positions 1-4 while respecting these constraints.

Possible assignments:
- If L is in 1: then A can be 2 or 4, P can be 2 or 3 or 4.
  - A in 2: then P must be 3 or 4. But 4 would be taken by A or P, so P in 3: positions 1=L, 2=A, 3=P, 4=?, 5=S. Need one more letter for position 4, not T,E,N.
  - A in 4: then P can be 2 or 3. P in 2: positions 1=L, 2=P, 3=?, 4=A, 5=S. Need one more letter for position 3.
- If L is in 4: then A can be 1, 2, or 4 (but 4 is L), so 1 or 2. P can be 2,3.
  - A in 1: then P can be 2 or 3. P in 2: positions 1=A, 2=P, 3=?, 4=L, 5=S. Need one more letter for position 3.
  - A in 2: then P can be 3. positions 1=?, 2=A, 3=P, 4=L, 5=S. Need one more letter for position 1.

Let’s pick one that introduces common new letters. The simplest seems:

- L in 1, A in 2, P in 3, and a new common letter in 4. The new letter should be consonant not yet used (not T,E,N). Good choices: R, D, C, etc. Let’s try R.

So word would be L A P R S → LAPRS – but that’s not a valid English word.

Alternative: A in 1, P in 2, new letter in 3, L in 4.

Word: A P ? L S. Need valid 5-letter word. ""APALS"" – not valid.

Another: A in 1, P in 3, L in 4. Then 2 and 5 are determined. Word: A _ P L S. Need valid word. ""APPLY"" – but Y not yet tested. ""APERS"" – not valid.

Another: L in 4, A in 2, P in 3. Word: _ A P L S. Need valid word. ""C A P L S"" – ""CAPLS"" invalid. ""B A P L S"" – ""BAPLS"" invalid.

Another: L in 1, P in 2, A in 4. Word: L P _ A S. Need valid word. ""L P R A S"" – ""LPRAS"" invalid.

Another: L in 1, A in 4, P in 2. Word: L P _ A S. Same issue.

Another: L in 1, A in 2, P in 4. Word: L A _ P S. Need valid word. ""L A C P S"" – ""LACPS"" invalid.

Another: L in 4, A in 1, P in 2. Word: A P _ L S. Need valid word. ""A P R L S"" – ""APRLS"" invalid.

Hmm, none of these are valid. Let’s try a different new letter. Instead of R, try D.

Word: A P D L S – invalid.

Another: L in 1, A in 2, P in 3, new letter in 4. Word: L A P ? S. Need valid word. ""LAPIS"" – yes, that’s a valid 5-letter word meaning a gemstone.

Check constraints:
- L in 1: allowed (was not in 2 or 3).
- A in 2: allowed (was not in 3).
- P in 3: allowed (was not in 1).
- S in 5: confirmed.
- New letter I in 4: not T,E,N, and not yet used.

This seems valid and uses a known word.

So word would be L A P R S → LAPRS – but that’s not a valid English word.

Alternative: A in 1, P in 2, new letter in 3, L in 4.

Word: A P ? L S. Need valid 5-letter word. ""APALS"" – not valid.

Another: A in 1, P in 3, L in 4. Then 2 and 5 are determined. Word: A _ P L S. Need valid word. ""APPLY"" – but Y not yet tested. ""APERS"" – not valid.

Another: L in 4, A in 2, P in 3. Word: _ A P L S. Need valid word. ""C A P L S"" – ""CAPLS"" invalid. ""B A P L S"" – ""BAPLS"" invalid.

Another: L in 1, P in 2, A in 4. Word: L P _ A S. Need valid word. ""L P R A S"" – ""LPRAS"" invalid.

Another: L in 1, A in 4, P in 2. Word: L P _ A S. Same issue.

Another: L in 1, A in 2, P in 4. Word: L A _ P S. Need valid word. ""L A C P S"" – ""LACPS"" invalid.

Another: L in 4, A in 1, P in 2. Word: A P _ L S. Need valid word. ""A P R L S"" – ""APRLS"" invalid.

Hmm, none of these are valid. Let’s try a different new letter. Instead of R, try D.

Word: A P D L S – invalid.

Another: L in 1, A in 2, P in 3, new letter in 4. Word: L A P ? S. Need valid word. ""LAPIS"" – yes, that’s a valid 5-letter word meaning a gemstone.

Check constraints:
- L in 1: allowed (was not in 2 or 3).
- A in 2: allowed (was not in 3).
- P in 3: allowed (was not in 1).
- S in 5: confirmed.
- New letter I in 4: not T,E,N, and not yet used.

This seems valid and uses a known word.",Guess 3: LAPIS -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) A(✓) P(✓) I(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
