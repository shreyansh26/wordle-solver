### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some popular starting words include:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is often considered one of the best starting words because it contains:
- C (very common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to eliminate possibilities quickly.

Letters known NOT to be in the word at all:

Letters known TO be in the word (but whose positions are still unknown):
- E (from CRANE and STOLE, both showing E(-) – so E is in the word but not in position 5 or 4)
- S (from STOLE, showing S(-) – so S is in the word but not in position 1)

So far we know:
- The word must contain both S and E.
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5, so E must be in 1, 2, or 3.
- S cannot be in position 1, so S must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- We have eliminated C, R, A, N, T, O, L.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tested yet: I, U, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, Y, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and E.
2. E is in position 1, 2, or 3.
3. S is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
4. Uses only the remaining letters.

Possible patterns:
- E _ S _ _ (E in 1, S in 3)
- E _ _ S _ (E in 1, S in 4)

- _ _ E S _ (E in 3, S in 4)
- _ _ _ E S (E in 4, but E can’t be in 4 – so invalid)
- _ _ E _ S (E in 3, S in 5)

Let’s look for valid words fitting these patterns.

Pattern _ E S _ _:
- Maybe ""USES"" but that’s only 4 letters.
- ""USES"" is invalid.

Pattern _ E _ S _:
- ""HEXES"" – H, E, X, E, S. X is allowed (not yet eliminated), but X is uncommon.
- ""PEELS"" – P, E, E, L, S. L is eliminated.
- ""BEDES"" – B, E, D, E, S. D is allowed, but ""BEDES"" is obscure.
- ""MEDES"" – M, E, D, E, S. Also obscure.

Pattern _ _ E S _:
- ""USES"" – 4 letters.
- ""PESES"" – invalid.

Pattern _ _ _ E S:
- E can’t be in 4, so invalid.

Pattern E _ S _ _:
- ""EXSIS"" – invalid.
- ""EUSES"" – invalid.

Pattern E _ _ S _:
- ""EUSES"" – invalid.
- ""EWEES"" – invalid.

Let’s try ""HEXES"":
- H, E, X, E, S.
- Contains both E and S.
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- Letters used: H, E, X, S. X is not eliminated yet, but is uncommon.
- Seems valid.

Another candidate: ""PEDES"" – but D is allowed, but ""PEDES"" is obscure.

Another candidate: ""MEDES"" – same issue.

Let’s try ""HEXES"" first as it’s more common.

But wait, let’s think of more common words:
- ""USES"" – too short.
- ""PESS"" – too short.
- ""SEEPS"" – contains E and S, but P is allowed. Let’s check:
  - S, E, E, P, S.
  - Contains both E and S.
  - E is in positions 2 and 3 (allowed).
  - S is in positions 1 and 5 (but S cannot be in position 1 – so invalid).

""SEEPS"" is invalid because S is in position 1.

""PEEPS"" – P, E, E, P, S.
- E in 2 and 3 (allowed).
- S in 5 (allowed).
- No eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, T, O, L).
- Uses P, E, S – all allowed.

""PEEPS"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Another candidate: ""BEDES"" – but D is allowed, but ""BEDES"" is obscure.

""MEDES"" – same.

""HEXES"" seems better.

Between ""HEXES"" and ""PEEPS"":
- ""HEXES"" uses X (less common).
- ""PEEPS"" uses P (common).

""PEEPS"" is more likely.

But let’s check ""PEEPS"":
- P, E, E, P, S.
- Contains both E and S.
- E in positions 2 and 3 (allowed).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some popular starting words include:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is often considered one of the best starting words because it contains:
- C (very common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to eliminate possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) – C is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- N(x) – N is not in the word at all.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: C, R, A, N.
- The word contains E somewhere, but not in the 5th position.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E, but not in position 5.
2. Does not contain C, R, A, N.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good letters to try next: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

A strong candidate is ""STOLE"":
- S, T, O, L, E.
- E is in position 4 (not 5), satisfying the feedback.
- No C, R, A, N.
- Uses common letters S, T, O, L.

Another candidate could be ""SPOKE"", but let's go with ""STOLE"" for now.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STOLE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

Letters known NOT to be in the word at all:
C, R, A, N, T, O, L

Letters known TO be in the word (but whose positions are still unknown):
- E (from CRANE and STOLE, both showing E(-) – so E is in the word but not in position 5 or 4)
- S (from STOLE, showing S(-) – so S is in the word but not in position 1)

So far we know:
- The word must contain both S and E.
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5, so E must be in 1, 2, or 3.
- S cannot be in position 1, so S must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- We have eliminated C, R, A, N, T, O, L.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tested yet: I, U, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, Y, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and E.
2. E is in position 1, 2, or 3.
3. S is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
4. Uses only the remaining letters.

Possible patterns:
- E _ S _ _ (E in 1, S in 3)
- E _ _ S _ (E in 1, S in 4)
- _ E S _ _ (E in 2, S in 3)
- _ E _ S _ (E in 2, S in 4)
- _ _ E S _ (E in 3, S in 4)
- _ _ _ E S (E in 4, but E can’t be in 4 – so invalid)
- _ _ E _ S (E in 3, S in 5)

Let’s look for valid words fitting these patterns.

Pattern _ E S _ _:
- Maybe ""USES"" but that’s only 4 letters.
- ""USES"" is invalid.

Pattern _ E _ S _:
- ""HEXES"" – H, E, X, E, S. X is allowed (not yet eliminated), but X is uncommon.
- ""PEELS"" – P, E, E, L, S. L is eliminated.
- ""BEDES"" – B, E, D, E, S. D is allowed, but ""BEDES"" is obscure.
- ""MEDES"" – M, E, D, E, S. Also obscure.

Pattern _ _ E S _:
- ""USES"" – 4 letters.
- ""PESES"" – invalid.

Pattern _ _ _ E S:
- E can’t be in 4, so invalid.

Pattern E _ S _ _:
- ""EXSIS"" – invalid.
- ""EUSES"" – invalid.

Pattern E _ _ S _:
- ""EUSES"" – invalid.
- ""EWEES"" – invalid.

Let’s try ""HEXES"":
- H, E, X, E, S.
- Contains both E and S.
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- Letters used: H, E, X, S. X is not eliminated yet, but is uncommon.
- Seems valid.

Another candidate: ""PEDES"" – but D is allowed, but ""PEDES"" is obscure.

Another candidate: ""MEDES"" – same issue.

Let’s try ""HEXES"" first as it’s more common.

But wait, let’s think of more common words:
- ""USES"" – too short.
- ""PESS"" – too short.
- ""SEEPS"" – contains E and S, but P is allowed. Let’s check:
  - S, E, E, P, S.
  - Contains both E and S.
  - E is in positions 2 and 3 (allowed).
  - S is in positions 1 and 5 (but S cannot be in position 1 – so invalid).

""SEEPS"" is invalid because S is in position 1.

""PEEPS"" – P, E, E, P, S.
- E in 2 and 3 (allowed).
- S in 5 (allowed).
- No eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, T, O, L).
- Uses P, E, S – all allowed.

""PEEPS"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Another candidate: ""BEDES"" – but D is allowed, but ""BEDES"" is obscure.

""MEDES"" – same.

""HEXES"" seems better.

Between ""HEXES"" and ""PEEPS"":
- ""HEXES"" uses X (less common).
- ""PEEPS"" uses P (common).

""PEEPS"" is more likely.

But let’s check ""PEEPS"":
- P, E, E, P, S.
- Contains both E and S.
- E in positions 2 and 3 (allowed).
- S in position 5 (allowed).
- No eliminated letters.
- Valid word.

So ""PEEPS"" seems like a good next guess.

Another candidate: ""SEEPS"" – but S in position 1 is invalid.

""PEEPS"" is valid.

Let’s go with ""PEEPS"".

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some popular starting words include:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is often considered one of the best starting words because it contains:
- C (very common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to eliminate possibilities quickly.

- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.

1. Contains E, but not in position 5.
2. Does not contain C, R, A, N.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good letters to try next: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

A strong candidate is ""STOLE"":
- S, T, O, L, E.
- E is in position 4 (not 5), satisfying the feedback.
- No C, R, A, N.
- Uses common letters S, T, O, L.

Another candidate could be ""SPOKE"", but let's go with ""STOLE"" for now.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: STOLE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

Letters known NOT to be in the word at all:
C, R, A, N, T, O, L

Letters known TO be in the word (but whose positions are still unknown):
- E (from CRANE and STOLE, both showing E(-) – so E is in the word but not in position 5 or 4)
- S (from STOLE, showing S(-) – so S is in the word but not in position 1)

So far we know:
- The word must contain both S and E.
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5, so E must be in 1, 2, or 3.
- S cannot be in position 1, so S must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- We have eliminated C, R, A, N, T, O, L.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tested yet: I, U, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, Y, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and E.
2. E is in position 1, 2, or 3.
3. S is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
4. Uses only the remaining letters.

Possible patterns:
- E _ S _ _ (E in 1, S in 3)
- E _ _ S _ (E in 1, S in 4)
- _ E S _ _ (E in 2, S in 3)
- _ E _ S _ (E in 2, S in 4)
- _ _ E S _ (E in 3, S in 4)
- _ _ _ E S (E in 4, but E can’t be in 4 – so invalid)
- _ _ E _ S (E in 3, S in 5)

Let’s look for valid words fitting these patterns.

Pattern _ E S _ _:
- Maybe ""USES"" but that’s only 4 letters.
- ""USES"" is invalid.

Pattern _ E _ S _:
- ""HEXES"" – H, E, X, E, S. X is allowed (not yet eliminated), but X is uncommon.
- ""PEELS"" – P, E, E, L, S. L is eliminated.
- ""BEDES"" – B, E, D, E, S. D is allowed, but ""BEDES"" is obscure.
- ""MEDES"" – M, E, D, E, S. Also obscure.

Pattern _ _ E S _:
- ""USES"" – 4 letters.
- ""PESES"" – invalid.

Pattern _ _ _ E S:
- E can’t be in 4, so invalid.

Pattern E _ S _ _:
- ""EXSIS"" – invalid.
- ""EUSES"" – invalid.

Pattern E _ _ S _:
- ""EUSES"" – invalid.
- ""EWEES"" – invalid.

Let’s try ""HEXES"":
- H, E, X, E, S.
- Contains both E and S.
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- Letters used: H, E, X, S. X is not eliminated yet, but is uncommon.
- Seems valid.

Another candidate: ""PEDES"" – but D is allowed, but ""PEDES"" is obscure.

Another candidate: ""MEDES"" – same issue.

Let’s try ""HEXES"" first as it’s more common.

But wait, let’s think of more common words:
- ""USES"" – too short.
- ""PESS"" – too short.
- ""SEEPS"" – contains E and S, but P is allowed. Let’s check:
  - S, E, E, P, S.
  - Contains both E and S.
  - E is in positions 2 and 3 (allowed).
  - S is in positions 1 and 5 (but S cannot be in position 1 – so invalid).

""SEEPS"" is invalid because S is in position 1.

""PEEPS"" – P, E, E, P, S.
- E in 2 and 3 (allowed).
- S in 5 (allowed).
- No eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, T, O, L).
- Uses P, E, S – all allowed.

""PEEPS"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Another candidate: ""BEDES"" – but D is allowed, but ""BEDES"" is obscure.

""MEDES"" – same.

""HEXES"" seems better.

Between ""HEXES"" and ""PEEPS"":
- ""HEXES"" uses X (less common).
- ""PEEPS"" uses P (common).

""PEEPS"" is more likely.

But let’s check ""PEEPS"":
- P, E, E, P, S.
- Contains both E and S.
- E in positions 2 and 3 (allowed).
- S in position 5 (allowed).
- No eliminated letters.
- Valid word.

So ""PEEPS"" seems like a good next guess.

Another candidate: ""SEEPS"" – but S in position 1 is invalid.

""PEEPS"" is valid.

Let’s go with ""PEEPS"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: STOLE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(-)
Guess 3: PEEPS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) E(-) P(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback on PEEPS:
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- E(✓) – the first E is in the correct position (position 2).
- E(-) – the second E is in the word but not in position 3.
- P(x) – P is not in the word (again).
- S(✓) – S is in the correct position (position 5).

So now we know:
- Positions 2 and 5 are fixed: _ E _ _ S
- Letters definitely in the word: E (position 2), S (position 5)
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, T, O, L, P
- The second E (from PEEPS) must appear somewhere else, but position 3 is excluded. So the second E must be in position 1 or 4.
- However, position 5 is already S, so the second E must be in position 1 or 4.

Possible patterns:
1. E E _ _ S  (E in position 1 and 2)
2. _ E E _ S  (E in position 2 and 3 – but position 3 is excluded for E, so invalid)
3. _ E _ E S  (E in position 2 and 4)

So the word must be either:
- E E _ _ S
- _ E _ E S

Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns with the remaining letters (not C, R, A, N, T, O, L, P).

For pattern E E _ _ S:
- Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.
- ""EEDIS"" – invalid.
- ""EEMIS"" – invalid.
- ""EEXYS"" – invalid.
- ""EEDYS"" – invalid.
- ""EEMYS"" – invalid.
- ""EEDUS"" – invalid.
- ""EEMUS"" – invalid.
- ""EEDIS"" – invalid.
- ""EEMIS"" – invalid.
- ""EEXYS"" – invalid.
- ""EEDYS"" – invalid.
- ""EEMYS"" – invalid.
- ""EEDUS"" – invalid.
- ""EEMUS"" – invalid.

This seems unlikely. Let’s check pattern _ E _ E S:
- _ E _ E S
- Possible first letter: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y
- Second letter: E (fixed)
- Third letter: any remaining except excluded letters
- Fourth letter: E (fixed)
- Fifth letter: S (fixed)

Looking for words:
- B E _ E S → ""BEEFS"" – but F is allowed, S is allowed.
  - B, E, E, F, S
  - Contains E in position 2 and 4 (allowed)
  - S in position 5 (allowed)
  - No excluded letters
  - Valid word

- D E _ E S → ""DEEFS"" – invalid
- F E _ E S → ""FEELS"" – but L is excluded
- G E _ E S → ""GEELS"" – L excluded
- H E _ E S → ""HEEFS"" – invalid
- I E _ E S → ""IEEFS"" – invalid
- K E _ E S → ""KEEFS"" – invalid
- M E _ E S → ""MEEPS"" – P excluded
- U E _ E S → ""UEEFS"" – invalid
- V E _ E S → ""VEEFS"" – invalid
- W E _ E S → ""WEEFS"" – invalid
- Y E _ E S → ""YEELS"" – L excluded

The only valid word seems to be ""BEEFS"".

Let’s verify:
- B E E F S
- E in position 2 (✓)
- S in position 5 (✓)
- Second E in position 4 (allowed, since position 3 is excluded)
- No excluded letters (C, R, A, N, T, O, L, P)
- Valid 5-letter word

Therefore, ""BEEFS"" is the next logical guess.

From the new feedback on BEEFS:
- B(x) – B is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is still correctly placed at position 2.
- E(-) – the second E is in the word but not in position 3.
- F(x) – F is not in the word.
- S(✓) – S is still correctly placed at position 5.

So we now know:
- Pattern: _ E _ _ S
- Letters in word: E (position 2), S (position 5)
- Second E must appear in position 1 or 4 (since position 3 is excluded and position 2 is already E).
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, T, O, L, P, B, F

Possible patterns:
1. E E _ _ S
2. _ E _ E S

Checking pattern 1: E E _ _ S
- Possible letters left: D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y
- Need a valid 5-letter word starting with EE.
- ""EEDIS"" – invalid
- ""EEMIS"" – invalid

Pattern 2: _ E _ E S
- First letter: must be from remaining letters (D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y)
- Second letter: E
- Third letter: must be from remaining letters
- Fourth letter: E
- Fifth letter: S

Looking for valid words:
- D E _ E S → ""DEEFS"" – F excluded
- G E _ E S → ""GEELS"" – L excluded
- H E _ E S → ""HEEFS"" – F excluded
- I E _ E S → ""IEEFS"" – invalid
- K E _ E S → ""KEEFS"" – F excluded
- M E _ E S → ""MEEFS"" – F excluded
- U E _ E S → ""UEEFS"" – invalid
- V E _ E S → ""VEEFS"" – invalid
- W E _ E S → ""WEEFS"" – invalid
- Y E _ E S → ""YEELS"" – L excluded

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me re-examine remaining letters.

Remaining letters (not yet eliminated): D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, plus any others not used.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the second E is in position 1, making the word E E _ _ S.

Looking for valid words:
- ""EEDIS"" – invalid
- ""EEMIS"" – invalid
- ""EEXYS"" – invalid
- ""EEDYS"" – invalid
- ""EEMYS"" – invalid
- ""EEDUS"" – invalid
- ""EEMUS"" – invalid
- ""EEDIS"" – invalid
- ""EEMIS"" – invalid
- ""EEXYS"" – invalid
- ""EEDYS"" – invalid
- ""EEMYS"" – invalid
- ""EEDUS"" – invalid
- ""EEMUS"" – invalid

This seems problematic. Maybe the second E is in position 4, making the word _ E _ E S.

But earlier checks didn't yield valid words. Let me list all possible combinations:

For _ E _ E S:
- D E _ E S → ""DEEFS"" – F excluded
- G E _ E S → ""GEELS"" – L excluded
- H E _ E S → ""HEEFS"" – F excluded
- I E _ E S → ""IEEFS"" – invalid
- K E _ E S → ""KEEFS"" – F excluded
- M E _ E S → ""MEEFS"" – F excluded
- U E _ E S → ""UEEFS"" – invalid
- V E _ E S → ""VEEFS"" – invalid
- W E _ E S → ""WEEFS"" – invalid
- Y E _ E S → ""YEELS"" – L excluded

None of these are valid. This suggests my earlier assumption might be wrong. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Actually, the word must be _ E _ _ S with:
- E in position 2
- S in position 5
- Second E must appear in position 1 or 4 (since position 3 is excluded for E)
- Letters used so far: C, R, A, N, T, O, L, P, B, F are excluded
- Remaining letters: D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y

Possible words:
- E E _ _ S → ""EEDIS"" – invalid
- _ E _ E S → ""DEEFS"" – F excluded
- ""KEEFS"" – F excluded
- ""HEEFS"" – F excluded
- ""MEEFS"" – F excluded
- ""GEELS"" – L excluded
- ""YEELS"" – L excluded

Wait, let me think of other possibilities. Maybe the word has only one E, but the feedback says E(-) in PEEPS and BEEFS, meaning E is in the word but not in those positions. However, we already have E in position 2 (✓). The (-) indicates E is in the word but not in that position. So the word might have only one E in position 2, and no other E's.

But in PEEPS, the feedback was E(✓) E(-) – meaning the first E is correct (position 2), and the second E is in the word but not in position 3. This could imply the word has at least two E's, with one in position 2 and one elsewhere (position 1 or 4).

But none of the combinations seem to form valid words. This suggests I might have missed a letter. Let me list remaining letters again:

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, T, O, L, P, B, F
Remaining letters: D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, plus any others not used.

This is perplexing. Perhaps the word has only one E in position 2, and the (-) feedback in PEEPS and BEEFS simply means E is in the word (already confirmed in position 2) and not in those specific positions, which is redundant since we already have E in position 2.

Let me reconsider: maybe the word has only one E in position 2, and the (-) feedback is just confirming E is in the word (since we already have it in position 2). In that case, the word is _ E _ _ S with no other E's.

This is not working. I must have missed something. Let me list possible words with _ E _ _ S using remaining letters:

Looking at remaining letters: D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y

Possible words:
- D E M I S – but this is ""DEMIS"" which is valid
- D E G I S – ""DEGIS"" – invalid

The only valid word seems to be ""DEMIS"", but I'm not sure if it's recognized. Let me check:

""DEMIS"" – yes, it's a valid 5-letter word meaning a part or portion.

Thus, the next guess should be ""DEMIS"".

</think>

From the feedback so far:
- Pattern: _ E _ _ S
- Letters in word: E (position 2), S (position 5)
- Second E must appear in position 1 or 4 (since position 3 is excluded)
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, T, O, L, P, B, F

After checking remaining letters, the only valid word that fits is ""DEMIS"".

<guess>DEMIS</guess>",DEMIS,"From the new feedback on BEEFS:
- B(x) – B is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is still correctly placed at position 2.
- E(-) – the second E is in the word but not in position 3.
- F(x) – F is not in the word.
- S(✓) – S is still correctly placed at position 5.

So we now know:
- Pattern: _ E _ _ S
- Letters in word: E (position 2), S (position 5)
- Second E must appear in position 1 or 4 (since position 3 is excluded and position 2 is already E).
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, T, O, L, P, B, F

Possible patterns:
1. E E _ _ S
2. _ E _ E S

Checking pattern 1: E E _ _ S
- Possible letters left: D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y
- Need a valid 5-letter word starting with EE.

Pattern 2: _ E _ E S
- First letter: must be from remaining letters (D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y)
- Second letter: E
- Third letter: must be from remaining letters
- Fourth letter: E
- Fifth letter: S

Looking for valid words:
- D E _ E S → ""DEEFS"" – F excluded
- G E _ E S → ""GEELS"" – L excluded
- H E _ E S → ""HEEFS"" – F excluded
- I E _ E S → ""IEEFS"" – invalid

- V E _ E S → ""VEEFS"" – invalid
- W E _ E S → ""WEEFS"" – invalid
- Y E _ E S → ""YEELS"" – L excluded

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me re-examine remaining letters.

Remaining letters (not yet eliminated): D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, plus any others not used.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the second E is in position 1, making the word E E _ _ S.

Looking for valid words:
- ""EEDIS"" – invalid
- ""EEMIS"" – invalid
- ""EEXYS"" – invalid
- ""EEDYS"" – invalid

- ""EEDYS"" – invalid
- ""EEMYS"" – invalid
- ""EEDUS"" – invalid
- ""EEMUS"" – invalid

This seems problematic. Maybe the second E is in position 4, making the word _ E _ E S.

But earlier checks didn't yield valid words. Let me list all possible combinations:

For _ E _ E S:
- D E _ E S → ""DEEFS"" – F excluded
- G E _ E S → ""GEELS"" – L excluded
- H E _ E S → ""HEEFS"" – F excluded
- I E _ E S → ""IEEFS"" – invalid

- U E _ E S → ""UEEFS"" – invalid
- V E _ E S → ""VEEFS"" – invalid
- W E _ E S → ""WEEFS"" – invalid
- Y E _ E S → ""YEELS"" – L excluded

None of these are valid. This suggests my earlier assumption might be wrong. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Actually, the word must be _ E _ _ S with:
- E in position 2
- S in position 5
- Second E must appear in position 1 or 4 (since position 3 is excluded for E)
- Letters used so far: C, R, A, N, T, O, L, P, B, F are excluded
- Remaining letters: D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y

Possible words:
- E E _ _ S → ""EEDIS"" – invalid
- _ E _ E S → ""DEEFS"" – F excluded
- ""KEEFS"" – F excluded
- ""HEEFS"" – F excluded
- ""MEEFS"" – F excluded
- ""GEELS"" – L excluded
- ""YEELS"" – L excluded

Wait, let me think of other possibilities. Maybe the word has only one E, but the feedback says E(-) in PEEPS and BEEFS, meaning E is in the word but not in those positions. However, we already have E in position 2 (✓). The (-) indicates E is in the word but not in that position. So the word might have only one E in position 2, and no other E's.

But in PEEPS, the feedback was E(✓) E(-) – meaning the first E is correct (position 2), and the second E is in the word but not in position 3. This could imply the word has at least two E's, with one in position 2 and one elsewhere (position 1 or 4).

But none of the combinations seem to form valid words. This suggests I might have missed a letter. Let me list remaining letters again:

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, T, O, L, P, B, F
Remaining letters: D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, plus any others not used.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Some popular starting words include:

- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is often considered one of the best starting words because it contains:
- C (very common consonant)
- R (very common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to eliminate possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) – C is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- A(x) – A is not in the word at all.
- N(x) – N is not in the word at all.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: C, R, A, N.
- The word contains E somewhere, but not in the 5th position.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains E, but not in position 5.
2. Does not contain C, R, A, N.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good letters to try next: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

A strong candidate is ""STOLE"":
- S, T, O, L, E.
- E is in position 4 (not 5), satisfying the feedback.
- No C, R, A, N.
- Uses common letters S, T, O, L.

Another candidate could be ""SPOKE"", but let's go with ""STOLE"" for now.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STOLE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

Letters known NOT to be in the word at all:
C, R, A, N, T, O, L

Letters known TO be in the word (but whose positions are still unknown):
- E (from CRANE and STOLE, both showing E(-) – so E is in the word but not in position 5 or 4)
- S (from STOLE, showing S(-) – so S is in the word but not in position 1)

So far we know:
- The word must contain both S and E.
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5, so E must be in 1, 2, or 3.
- S cannot be in position 1, so S must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- We have eliminated C, R, A, N, T, O, L.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tested yet: I, U, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, Y, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both S and E.
2. E is in position 1, 2, or 3.
3. S is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
4. Uses only the remaining letters.

Possible patterns:
- E _ S _ _ (E in 1, S in 3)
- E _ _ S _ (E in 1, S in 4)
- _ E S _ _ (E in 2, S in 3)
- _ E _ S _ (E in 2, S in 4)
- _ _ E S _ (E in 3, S in 4)
- _ _ _ E S (E in 4, but E can’t be in 4 – so invalid)
- _ _ E _ S (E in 3, S in 5)

Let’s look for valid words fitting these patterns.

Pattern _ E S _ _:
- Maybe ""USES"" but that’s only 4 letters.
- ""USES"" is invalid.

Pattern _ E _ S _:
- ""HEXES"" – H, E, X, E, S. X is allowed (not yet eliminated), but X is uncommon.
- ""PEELS"" – P, E, E, L, S. L is eliminated.
- ""BEDES"" – B, E, D, E, S. D is allowed, but ""BEDES"" is obscure.
- ""MEDES"" – M, E, D, E, S. Also obscure.

Pattern _ _ E S _:
- ""USES"" – 4 letters.
- ""PESES"" – invalid.

Pattern _ _ _ E S:
- E can’t be in 4, so invalid.

Pattern E _ S _ _:
- ""EXSIS"" – invalid.
- ""EUSES"" – invalid.

Pattern E _ _ S _:
- ""EUSES"" – invalid.
- ""EWEES"" – invalid.

Let’s try ""HEXES"":
- H, E, X, E, S.
- Contains both E and S.
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- Letters used: H, E, X, S. X is not eliminated yet, but is uncommon.
- Seems valid.

Another candidate: ""PEDES"" – but D is allowed, but ""PEDES"" is obscure.

Another candidate: ""MEDES"" – same issue.

Let’s try ""HEXES"" first as it’s more common.

But wait, let’s think of more common words:
- ""USES"" – too short.
- ""PESS"" – too short.
- ""SEEPS"" – contains E and S, but P is allowed. Let’s check:
  - S, E, E, P, S.
  - Contains both E and S.
  - E is in positions 2 and 3 (allowed).
  - S is in positions 1 and 5 (but S cannot be in position 1 – so invalid).

""SEEPS"" is invalid because S is in position 1.

""PEEPS"" – P, E, E, P, S.
- E in 2 and 3 (allowed).
- S in 5 (allowed).
- No eliminated letters (C, R, A, N, T, O, L).
- Uses P, E, S – all allowed.

""PEEPS"" is a valid 5-letter word.

Another candidate: ""BEDES"" – but D is allowed, but ""BEDES"" is obscure.

""MEDES"" – same.

""HEXES"" seems better.

Between ""HEXES"" and ""PEEPS"":
- ""HEXES"" uses X (less common).
- ""PEEPS"" uses P (common).

""PEEPS"" is more likely.

But let’s check ""PEEPS"":
- P, E, E, P, S.
- Contains both E and S.
- E in positions 2 and 3 (allowed).
- S in position 5 (allowed).
- No eliminated letters.
- Valid word.

So ""PEEPS"" seems like a good next guess.

Another candidate: ""SEEPS"" – but S in position 1 is invalid.

""PEEPS"" is valid.

Let’s go with ""PEEPS"".

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

Guess 3: PEEPS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) E(-) P(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback on PEEPS:
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- E(✓) – the first E is in the correct position (position 2).
- E(-) – the second E is in the word but not in position 3.
- P(x) – P is not in the word (again).
- S(✓) – S is in the correct position (position 5).

So now we know:
- Positions 2 and 5 are fixed: _ E _ _ S
- Letters definitely in the word: E (position 2), S (position 5)
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, T, O, L, P
- The second E (from PEEPS) must appear somewhere else, but position 3 is excluded. So the second E must be in position 1 or 4.
- However, position 5 is already S, so the second E must be in position 1 or 4.

Possible patterns:
1. E E _ _ S  (E in position 1 and 2)
2. _ E E _ S  (E in position 2 and 3 – but position 3 is excluded for E, so invalid)
3. _ E _ E S  (E in position 2 and 4)

So the word must be either:
- E E _ _ S
- _ E _ E S

Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns with the remaining letters (not C, R, A, N, T, O, L, P).

For pattern E E _ _ S:
- Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

This seems unlikely. Let’s check pattern _ E _ E S:
- _ E _ E S
- Possible first letter: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y
- Second letter: E (fixed)
- Third letter: any remaining except excluded letters
- Fourth letter: E (fixed)
- Fifth letter: S (fixed)

Looking for words:
- B E _ E S → ""BEEFS"" – but F is allowed, S is allowed.
  - B, E, E, F, S
  - Contains E in position 2 and 4 (allowed)
  - S in position 5 (allowed)
  - No excluded letters
  - Valid word

- D E _ E S → ""DEEFS"" – invalid
- F E _ E S → ""FEELS"" – but L is excluded
- G E _ E S → ""GEELS"" – L excluded
- H E _ E S → ""HEEFS"" – invalid
- I E _ E S → ""IEEFS"" – invalid
- K E _ E S → ""KEEFS"" – invalid
- M E _ E S → ""MEEPS"" – P excluded
- U E _ E S → ""UEEFS"" – invalid
- V E _ E S → ""VEEFS"" – invalid
- W E _ E S → ""WEEFS"" – invalid
- Y E _ E S → ""YEELS"" – L excluded

The only valid word seems to be ""BEEFS"".

Let’s verify:
- B E E F S
- E in position 2 (✓)
- S in position 5 (✓)
- Second E in position 4 (allowed, since position 3 is excluded)
- No excluded letters (C, R, A, N, T, O, L, P)
- Valid 5-letter word

Therefore, ""BEEFS"" is the next logical guess.

<guess>BEEFS</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: STOLE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(x) L(x) E(-)
Guess 3: PEEPS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) E(-) P(x) S(✓)
Guess 4: BEEFS -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) E(-) F(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on BEEFS:
- B(x) – B is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is still correctly placed at position 2.
- E(-) – the second E is in the word but not in position 3.
- F(x) – F is not in the word.
- S(✓) – S is still correctly placed at position 5.

So we now know:
- Pattern: _ E _ _ S
- Letters in word: E (position 2), S (position 5)
- Second E must appear in position 1 or 4 (since position 3 is excluded and position 2 is already E).
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, T, O, L, P, B, F

Possible patterns:
1. E E _ _ S
2. _ E _ E S

Checking pattern 1: E E _ _ S
- Possible letters left: D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y
- Need a valid 5-letter word starting with EE.
- ""EEDIS"" – invalid
- ""EEMIS"" – invalid

- ""EEMIS"" – invalid
- ""EEXYS"" – invalid
- ""EEDYS"" – invalid
- ""EEMYS"" – invalid
- ""EEDUS"" – invalid
- ""EEMUS"" – invalid

Pattern 2: _ E _ E S
- First letter: must be from remaining letters (D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y)
- Second letter: E
- Third letter: must be from remaining letters
- Fourth letter: E
- Fifth letter: S

Looking for valid words:
- D E _ E S → ""DEEFS"" – F excluded
- G E _ E S → ""GEELS"" – L excluded
- H E _ E S → ""HEEFS"" – F excluded
- I E _ E S → ""IEEFS"" – invalid
- K E _ E S → ""KEEFS"" – F excluded
- M E _ E S → ""MEEFS"" – F excluded
- U E _ E S → ""UEEFS"" – invalid
- V E _ E S → ""VEEFS"" – invalid
- W E _ E S → ""WEEFS"" – invalid
- Y E _ E S → ""YEELS"" – L excluded

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me re-examine remaining letters.

Remaining letters (not yet eliminated): D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, plus any others not used.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the second E is in position 1, making the word E E _ _ S.

Looking for valid words:
- ""EEDIS"" – invalid
- ""EEMIS"" – invalid
- ""EEXYS"" – invalid
- ""EEDYS"" – invalid
- ""EEMYS"" – invalid
- ""EEDUS"" – invalid
- ""EEMUS"" – invalid
- ""EEDIS"" – invalid
- ""EEMIS"" – invalid
- ""EEXYS"" – invalid
- ""EEDYS"" – invalid
- ""EEMYS"" – invalid
- ""EEDUS"" – invalid
- ""EEMUS"" – invalid

This seems problematic. Maybe the second E is in position 4, making the word _ E _ E S.

But earlier checks didn't yield valid words. Let me list all possible combinations:

For _ E _ E S:
- D E _ E S → ""DEEFS"" – F excluded
- G E _ E S → ""GEELS"" – L excluded
- H E _ E S → ""HEEFS"" – F excluded
- I E _ E S → ""IEEFS"" – invalid
- K E _ E S → ""KEEFS"" – F excluded
- M E _ E S → ""MEEFS"" – F excluded
- U E _ E S → ""UEEFS"" – invalid
- V E _ E S → ""VEEFS"" – invalid
- W E _ E S → ""WEEFS"" – invalid
- Y E _ E S → ""YEELS"" – L excluded

None of these are valid. This suggests my earlier assumption might be wrong. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Actually, the word must be _ E _ _ S with:
- E in position 2
- S in position 5
- Second E must appear in position 1 or 4 (since position 3 is excluded for E)
- Letters used so far: C, R, A, N, T, O, L, P, B, F are excluded
- Remaining letters: D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y

Possible words:
- E E _ _ S → ""EEDIS"" – invalid
- _ E _ E S → ""DEEFS"" – F excluded
- ""KEEFS"" – F excluded
- ""HEEFS"" – F excluded
- ""MEEFS"" – F excluded
- ""GEELS"" – L excluded
- ""YEELS"" – L excluded

Wait, let me think of other possibilities. Maybe the word has only one E, but the feedback says E(-) in PEEPS and BEEFS, meaning E is in the word but not in those positions. However, we already have E in position 2 (✓). The (-) indicates E is in the word but not in that position. So the word might have only one E in position 2, and no other E's.

But in PEEPS, the feedback was E(✓) E(-) – meaning the first E is correct (position 2), and the second E is in the word but not in position 3. This could imply the word has at least two E's, with one in position 2 and one elsewhere (position 1 or 4).

But none of the combinations seem to form valid words. This suggests I might have missed a letter. Let me list remaining letters again:

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, T, O, L, P, B, F
Remaining letters: D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, plus any others not used.

Looking for _ E _ _ S:
- D E _ _ S → ""DEIMS"" – invalid
- D E _ _ S → ""DEWIS"" – invalid
- D E _ _ S → ""DEGIS"" – invalid
- D E _ _ S → ""DEKIS"" – invalid
- D E _ _ S → ""DEMS"" – too short
- G E _ _ S → ""GEIMS"" – invalid

- H E _ _ S → ""HEIMS"" – invalid
- H E _ _ S → ""HEKIS"" – invalid
- I E _ _ S → ""IEIMS"" – invalid

- U E _ _ S → ""UEIMS"" – invalid
- U E _ _ S → ""UEKIS"" – invalid
- V E _ _ S → ""VEIMS"" – invalid
- V E _ _ S → ""VEKIS"" – invalid
- W E _ _ S → ""WEIMS"" – invalid
- W E _ _ S → ""WEKIS"" – invalid
- Y E _ _ S → ""YEIMS"" – invalid
- Y E _ _ S → ""YEKIS"" – invalid

This is perplexing. Perhaps the word has only one E in position 2, and the (-) feedback in PEEPS and BEEFS simply means E is in the word (already confirmed in position 2) and not in those specific positions, which is redundant since we already have E in position 2.

Let me reconsider: maybe the word has only one E in position 2, and the (-) feedback is just confirming E is in the word (since we already have it in position 2). In that case, the word is _ E _ _ S with no other E's.

Looking for _ E _ _ S with remaining letters:
- D E _ _ S → ""DEIMS"" – invalid
- D E _ _ S → ""DEKIS"" – invalid
- D E _ _ S → ""DEWIS"" – invalid
- D E _ _ S → ""DEGIS"" – invalid
- D E _ _ S → ""DEHIS"" – invalid

- W E _ _ S → ""WEHIS"" – invalid
- Y E _ _ S → ""YEIMS"" – invalid
- Y E _ _ S → ""YEKIS"" – invalid
- Y E _ _ S → ""YEHIS"" – invalid

This is not working. I must have missed something. Let me list possible words with _ E _ _ S using remaining letters:

Looking at remaining letters: D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y

Possible words:
- D E M I S – but this is ""DEMIS"" which is valid
- D E G I S – ""DEGIS"" – invalid
- D E H I S – ""DEHIS"" – invalid
- D E K I S – ""DEKIS"" – invalid
- D E M I S – ""DEMIS"" – valid
- D E U I S – ""DEUIS"" – invalid
- D E V I S – ""DEVIS"" – invalid
- D E W I S – ""DEWIS"" – invalid
- D E Y I S – ""DEYIS"" – invalid
- G E M I S – ""GEMIS"" – invalid
- G E D I S – ""GEDIS"" – invalid

- H E D I S – ""HEDIS"" – invalid
- I E M I S – ""IEMIS"" – invalid
- I E D I S – ""IEDIS"" – invalid
- K E M I S – ""KEMIS"" – invalid
- K E D I S – ""KEDIS"" – invalid
- M E D I S – ""MEDIS"" – invalid
- M E G I S – ""MEGIS"" – invalid
- U E M I S – ""UEMIS"" – invalid
- U E D I S – ""UEDIS"" – invalid
- V E M I S – ""VEMIS"" – invalid
- V E D I S – ""VEDIS"" – invalid
- W E M I S – ""WEMIS"" – invalid
- W E D I S – ""WEDIS"" – invalid
- Y E M I S – ""YEMIS"" – invalid
- Y E D I S – ""YEDIS"" – invalid

The only valid word seems to be ""DEMIS"", but I'm not sure if it's recognized. Let me check:

""DEMIS"" – yes, it's a valid 5-letter word meaning a part or portion.

Thus, the next guess should be ""DEMIS"".From the feedback so far:
- Pattern: _ E _ _ S
- Letters in word: E (position 2), S (position 5)
- Second E must appear in position 1 or 4 (since position 3 is excluded)
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, T, O, L, P, B, F

After checking remaining letters, the only valid word that fits is ""DEMIS"".

Maybe the second E is in position 4, making the word _ E _ E S.\n\nBut earlier checks didn\'t yield valid words. Let me list all possible combinations:\n\nFor _ E _ E S:\n- D E _ E S → ""DEEFS"" – F excluded\n- G E _ E S → ""GEELS"" – L excluded\n- H E _ E S → ""HEEFS"" – F excluded\n- I E _ E S → ""IEEFS"" – invalid\n- K E _ E S → ""KEEFS"" – F excluded\n- M E _ E S → ""MEEFS"" – F excluded\n- U E _ E S → ""UEEFS"" – invalid\n- V E _ E S → ""VEEFS"" – invalid\n- W E _ E S → ""WEEFS"" – invalid\n- Y E _ E S → ""YEELS"" – L excluded\n\nNone of these are valid. This suggests my earlier assumption might be wrong. Let me re-examine the constraints.\n\nActually, the word must be _ E _ _ S with:\n- E in position 2\n- S in position 5\n- Second E must appear in position 1 or 4 (since position 3 is excluded for E)\n- Letters used so far: C, R, A, N, T, O, L, P, B, F are excluded\n- Remaining letters: D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y\n\nPossible words:\n- E E _ _ S → ""EEDIS"" – invalid\n- _ E _ E S → ""DEEFS"" – F excluded\n- ""KEEFS"" – F excluded\n- ""HEEFS"" – F excluded\n- ""MEEFS"" – F excluded\n- ""GEELS"" – L excluded\n- ""YEELS"" – L excluded\n\nWait, let me think of other possibilities. Maybe the word has only one E, but the feedback says E(-) in PEEPS and BEEFS, meaning E is in the word but not in those positions. However, we already have E in position 2 (✓). The (-) indicates E is in the word but not in that position. So the word might have only one E in position 2, and no other E\'s.\n\nBut in PEEPS, the feedback was E(✓) E(-) – meaning the first E is correct (position 2), and the second E is in the word but not in position 3. This could imply the word has at least two E\'s, with one in position 2 and one elsewhere (position 1 or 4).\n\nBut none of the combinations seem to form valid words. This suggests I might have missed a letter. Let me list remaining letters again:\n\nExcluded letters: C, R, A, N, T, O, L, P, B, F\nRemaining letters: D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, plus any others not used.\n\nLooking for _ E _ _ S:\n- D E _ _ S → ""DEIMS"" – invalid\n- D E _ _ S → ""DEWIS"" – invalid\n- D E _ _ S → ""DEGIS"" – invalid\n- D E _ _ S → ""DEKIS"" – invalid\n- D E _ _ S → ""DEMS"" – too short\n- G E _ _ S → ""GEIMS"" – invalid\n- G E _ _ S → ""GEKIS"" – invalid\n- H E _ _ S → ""HEIMS"" – invalid\n- H E _ _ S → ""HEKIS"" – invalid\n- I E _ _ S → ""IEIMS"" – invalid\n- I E _ _ S → ""IEKIS"" – invalid\n- K E _ _ S → ""KEIMS"" – invalid\n- K E _ _ S → ""KEKIS"" – invalid\n- M E _ _ S → ""MEIMS"" – invalid\n- M E _ _ S → ""MEKIS"" – invalid\n- U E _ _ S → ""UEIMS"" – invalid\n- U E _ _ S → ""UEKIS"" – invalid\n- V E _ _ S → ""VEIMS"" – invalid\n- V E _ _ S → ""VEKIS"" – invalid\n- W E _ _ S → ""WEIMS"" – invalid\n- W E _ _ S → ""WEKIS"" – invalid\n- Y E _ _ S → ""YEIMS"" – invalid\n- Y E _ _ S → ""YEKIS"" – invalid\n\nThis is perplexing. Perhaps the word has only one E in position 2, and the (-) feedback in PEEPS and BEEFS simply means E is in the word (already confirmed in position 2) and not in those specific positions, which is redundant since we already have E in position 2.\n\nLet me reconsider: maybe the word has only one E in position 2, and the (-) feedback is just confirming E is in the word (since we already have it in position 2). In that case, the word is _ E _ _ S with no other E\'s.\n\nLooking for _ E _ _ S with remaining letters:\n- D E _ _ S → ""DEIMS"" – invalid\n- D E _ _ S → ""DEKIS"" – invalid\n- D E _ _ S → ""DEWIS"" – invalid\n- D E _ _ S → ""DEGIS"" – invalid\n- D E _ _ S → ""DEHIS"" – invalid\n- G E _ _ S → ""GEIMS"" – invalid\n- G E _ _ S → ""GEKIS"" – invalid\n- G E _ _ S → ""GEHIS"" – invalid\n- H E _ _ S → ""HEIMS"" – invalid\n- H E _ _ S → ""HEKIS"" – invalid\n- H E _ _ S → ""HEHIS"" – invalid\n- I E _ _ S → ""IEIMS"" – invalid\n- I E _ _ S → ""IEKIS"" – invalid\n- I E _ _ S → ""IEHIS"" – invalid\n- K E _ _ S → ""KEIMS"" – invalid\n- K E _ _ S → ""KEKIS"" – invalid\n- K E _ _ S → ""KEHIS"" – invalid\n- M E _ _ S → ""MEIMS"" – invalid\n- M E _ _ S → ""MEKIS"" – invalid\n- M E _ _ S → ""MEHIS"" – invalid\n- U E _ _ S → ""UEIMS"" – invalid\n- U E _ _ S → ""UEKIS"" – invalid\n- U E _ _ S → ""UEHIS"" – invalid\n- V E _ _ S → ""VEIMS"" – invalid\n- V E _ _ S → ""VEKIS"" – invalid\n- V E _ _ S → ""VEHIS"" – invalid\n- W E _ _ S → ""WEIMS"" – invalid\n- W E _ _ S → ""WEKIS"" – invalid\n- W E _ _ S → ""WEHIS"" – invalid\n- Y E _ _ S → ""YEIMS"" – invalid\n- Y E _ _ S → ""YEKIS"" – invalid\n- Y E _ _ S → ""YEHIS"" – invalid\n\nThis is not working.
