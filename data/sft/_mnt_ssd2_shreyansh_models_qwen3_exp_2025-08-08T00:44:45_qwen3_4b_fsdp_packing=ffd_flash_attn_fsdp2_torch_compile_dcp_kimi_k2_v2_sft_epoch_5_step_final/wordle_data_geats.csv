### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

From the two rounds of feedback:

2. STEAL → S(-) T(-) E(-) A(-) L(x)

  – A cannot be in position 1 (from AROSE) or 4 (from STEAL)
  – S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or 1 (from STEAL)
  – E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) or 3 (from STEAL)

Remaining common consonants to try: N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

Possible positions:
- A: 2, 3, 5
- S: 2, 3, 5
- E: 1, 2, 4

Let’s pick a word that:
- Uses A, S, E in allowed positions
- Adds two new common consonants
- Avoids any excluded letters

A good candidate is “SNAKE”:
- S in position 1: allowed (only position 1 was excluded for S in STEAL, but STEAL had S in position 1 and it got (-), meaning S is in the word but not in position 1. So S in position 1 here would be invalid. Oops.)

Next candidate: “CHASE”
- C, H are new consonants.
- S in position 2: allowed
- A in position 3: allowed
- C in position 4: new
- E in position 5: allowed (E can be in 5, only 3 and 5 were excluded for E, but 5 was excluded in AROSE, so E cannot be in 5. So E in 5 is invalid.)

Next candidate: “SEACO” – but O is excluded.

Next candidate: “PEASE”
- P and another E, but E repeats and we don’t know if E appears twice.

Next candidate: “SPACE”
- S in 1: invalid
- S in 2: allowed
- P and C are new
- A in 3: allowed
- C in 5: allowed

This seems valid:
- S in 2 (allowed)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A balanced word that uses common letters is ""AROSE"" (A, R, O, S, E). This gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains A, S, and E.
- It does NOT contain R or O.
- A is not in position 1.
- S is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

Good next letters to try are common consonants like T, L, N, C, D, etc. and vowels like I, U. We need to place A, S, E in new positions and add new letters.

Possible positions for A: 2,3,4,5
Possible positions for S: 1,2,3,5
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4

Let's try a word that uses these letters in new positions and adds new common letters. ""STEAL"" uses S, T, E, A, L - but T and L are new and common. However, S is in position 1 (allowed), E is in position 3 (allowed), A is in position 4 (allowed), and we add T and L. This seems good.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - Contains A, S, E
   - Does NOT contain R, O

2. STEAL → S(-) T(-) E(-) A(-) L(x)
   - Contains S, E, A again
   - Does NOT contain T or L

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A, S, E
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, T, L
- Position exclusions:
  – A cannot be in position 1 (from AROSE) or 4 (from STEAL)
  – S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or 1 (from STEAL)
  – E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) or 3 (from STEAL)

Remaining common consonants to try: N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

We need to place A, S, E plus two new consonants in positions that satisfy the exclusions.

Possible positions:
- A: 2, 3, 5
- S: 2, 3, 5
- E: 1, 2, 4

Let’s pick a word that:
- Uses A, S, E in allowed positions
- Adds two new common consonants
- Avoids any excluded letters

A good candidate is “SNAKE”:
- S in position 1: allowed (only position 1 was excluded for S in STEAL, but STEAL had S in position 1 and it got (-), meaning S is in the word but not in position 1. So S in position 1 here would be invalid. Oops.)

Let me try “SAUCE”:
- S in position 1: invalid (from STEAL feedback, S is not in position 1).

Next candidate: “CHASE”
- C, H are new consonants.
- S in position 2: allowed
- A in position 3: allowed
- C in position 4: new
- E in position 5: allowed (E can be in 5, only 3 and 5 were excluded for E, but 5 was excluded in AROSE, so E cannot be in 5. So E in 5 is invalid.)

Next candidate: “SEACO” – but O is excluded.

Next candidate: “PEASE”
- P and another E, but E repeats and we don’t know if E appears twice.

Next candidate: “SPACE”
- S in 1: invalid
- S in 2: allowed
- P and C are new
- A in 3: allowed
- C in 5: allowed

This seems valid:
- S in 2 (allowed)
- P and C new
- A in 3 (allowed)
- C in 5 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)

So “SPACE” is a good next guess.

Known letters: A (pos 3), S, E  
Known absent letters: R, O, T, L, P, C, H, N  

Position constraints:
- A is fixed in position 3  
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4  
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5  

Remaining positions: 1, 2, 4, 5  
We need two more consonants (since A, S, E are already placed).

Possible placements:
- S can be in 2 or 5  
- E can be in 1, 2, or 4  

Let’s try to construct a word:
Case 1: S in 2  
  Then E can be 1 or 4  
  Need two new consonants for the remaining two spots.

Case 2: S in 5  
  Then E can be 1, 2, or 4  
  Need two new consonants for the remaining two spots.

Looking for common consonants not yet ruled out: D, G, M, B, K, etc.

Let’s try S in 2 and E in 4:
- S _ A E _  
Need two consonants for positions 1 and 5.  
A common word with these constraints: “SAGE” + one more consonant.  
“SAGIE” – but I is a vowel, and we already have A, E.  
“SABED” – D is new, B is new.  
“SABED” fits:  
- S in 2 (allowed)  
- A in 3 (fixed)  
- B and D are new consonants  
- E in 4 (allowed)  

This seems valid.

Another check:  
- S is not in 1 or 4 → OK (it’s in 2)  
- E is not in 3 or 5 → OK (it’s in 4)  
- All letters used are allowed.  

Therefore, “SABED” is a good next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by covering as many common letters as possible. Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A balanced word that uses common letters is ""AROSE"" (A, R, O, S, E). This gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants to start narrowing down possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains A, S, and E.
- It does NOT contain R or O.
- A is not in position 1.
- S is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

Good next letters to try are common consonants like T, L, N, C, D, etc. and vowels like I, U. We need to place A, S, E in new positions and add new letters.

Possible positions for A: 2,3,4,5
Possible positions for S: 1,2,3,5
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4

Let's try a word that uses these letters in new positions and adds new common letters. ""STEAL"" uses S, T, E, A, L - but T and L are new and common. However, S is in position 1 (allowed), E is in position 3 (allowed), A is in position 4 (allowed), and we add T and L. This seems good.

Guess 2: STEAL -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) E(-) A(-) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - Contains A, S, E
   - Does NOT contain R, O

2. STEAL → S(-) T(-) E(-) A(-) L(x)
   - Contains S, E, A again
   - Does NOT contain T or L

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A, S, E
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, T, L
- Position exclusions:
  – A cannot be in position 1 (from AROSE) or 4 (from STEAL)
  – S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) or 1 (from STEAL)
  – E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE) or 3 (from STEAL)

Remaining common consonants to try: N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

We need to place A, S, E plus two new consonants in positions that satisfy the exclusions.

Possible positions:
- A: 2, 3, 5
- S: 2, 3, 5
- E: 1, 2, 4

Let’s pick a word that:
- Uses A, S, E in allowed positions
- Adds two new common consonants
- Avoids any excluded letters

A good candidate is “SNAKE”:
- S in position 1: allowed (only position 1 was excluded for S in STEAL, but STEAL had S in position 1 and it got (-), meaning S is in the word but not in position 1. So S in position 1 here would be invalid. Oops.)

Let me try “SAUCE”:
- S in position 1: invalid (from STEAL feedback, S is not in position 1).

Next candidate: “CHASE”
- C, H are new consonants.
- S in position 2: allowed
- A in position 3: allowed
- C in position 4: new
- E in position 5: allowed (E can be in 5, only 3 and 5 were excluded for E, but 5 was excluded in AROSE, so E cannot be in 5. So E in 5 is invalid.)

Next candidate: “SEACO” – but O is excluded.

Next candidate: “PEASE”
- P and another E, but E repeats and we don’t know if E appears twice.

Next candidate: “SPACE”
- S in 1: invalid
- S in 2: allowed
- P and C are new
- A in 3: allowed
- C in 5: allowed

This seems valid:
- S in 2 (allowed)
- P and C new
- A in 3 (allowed)
- C in 5 (allowed)
- E in 4 (allowed)

So “SPACE” is a good next guess.

   - S is still in the word but not in position 1
   - P and C are not in the word
   - A is now fixed in position 3
   - E is still in the word but not in position 5

Known facts:
- Letters in the word: A, S, E
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, T, L, P, C
- Position constraints:
  – A is fixed in position 3
  – S cannot be in position 1, 4
  – E cannot be in position 3, 5
  – Positions 1, 2, 4, 5 still open for S and E

Remaining common consonants: N, D, M, B, G, H, K, etc.

We need to place:
- A in position 3
- S and E in allowed positions
- Two new consonants

Possible positions:
- S can be 2, 5
- E can be 1, 2, 4

Let’s try to form a word:
- If S is in 2, then E can be 1, 4
- If S is in 5, then E can be 1, 2, 4

Let’s try “SENSE” – but E repeats and we don’t know if E appears twice.

Next candidate: “SENDS”
- S in 1: invalid (from SPACE feedback, S is not in 1)
- S in 5: allowed
- E in 2: allowed
- N and D are new consonants
- S in 4: but S can’t be in 4 (from AROSE feedback)
So “SENDS” is invalid.

Next candidate: “SENDS” invalid.

Next candidate: “SHEEN”
- S in 1: invalid
- S in 5: allowed
- H and N are new
- E in 2: allowed
- E in 4: allowed
This seems valid:
- S in 5 (allowed)
- E in 2 and 4 (allowed)
- H and N new
- A is fixed in 3

Let’s tabulate all constraints from the five guesses.

Known letters in the word: A, S, E  
Known absent letters: R, O, T, L, P, C, H, N, B, D  

Position constraints:
- A is fixed in position 3 (from SPACE feedback: A(✓))  
- S cannot be in positions 1, 4, 5 (from AROSE: S not in 4; SHEEN: S not in 1; SABED: S not in 5)  
  ⇒ S must be in position 2  
- E cannot be in positions 3, 5 (from AROSE: E not in 5; SHEEN: E not in 3)  
  ⇒ E can be in positions 1, 2, 4  

But position 2 is already taken by S (from above), so E must be in 1 or 4.

Current word skeleton:
- Position 3: A (fixed)  
- Position 2: S (only remaining spot for S)  
- Positions 1, 4, 5: must be filled with two new consonants and one of E or the other consonant.

So the pattern is:
[1] [S] [A] [E or ?] [5]  
with E in 1 or 4, and two new consonants in the remaining two spots.

Available consonants (not yet ruled out): F, G, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try E in position 1:
E S A _ _  
We need two new consonants for positions 4 and 5.  
A common word: “ESCAP” – but P is out.  
“ESAGE” – but G and E are already considered.  
“ESAME” – M and E, but E repeats.  
“ESKIM” – M and K are new.  
“ESKIM” is valid:  
- E in 1 (allowed)  
- S in 2 (fixed)  
- A in 3 (fixed)  
- K and M are new consonants.

Let’s check constraints:
- E in 1: allowed (only 3,5 excluded)  
- S in 2: allowed (only 1,4,5 excluded)  
- K and M are new consonants not yet ruled out.

Therefore, “ESKIM” is a valid next guess.
