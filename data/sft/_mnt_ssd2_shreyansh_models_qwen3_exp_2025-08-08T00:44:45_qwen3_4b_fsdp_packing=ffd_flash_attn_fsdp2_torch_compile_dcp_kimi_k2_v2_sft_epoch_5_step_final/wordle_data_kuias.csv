For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A word like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains several of these high-frequency letters. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters that can help narrow down possibilities quickly.

- Letters definitely present: A and S (but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively)

3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, O, E, T, N

- A cannot be in position 1 (from AROSE) or position 3 (from STAIN)
- S cannot be in position 1 (from STAIN) or position 4 (from AROSE)
- I cannot be in position 4 (from STAIN)

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, S, I exactly once each and avoids the forbidden positions.  
We also need two additional distinct letters that have not been tested yet (to maximize information).

Good remaining consonants to try: L, C, D, B, M, P, etc.  
Good remaining vowels to try: U (since A and I are already used, and O and E are out).

A word that satisfies these constraints is “CLASP”:
- C and L are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 4 (but wait – position 4 was forbidden for S in AROSE). So CLASP is invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A word like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains several of these high-frequency letters. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters that can help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: R, O, E
- Letters definitely present: A and S (but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively)
- Remaining letters to test: consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc., and vowels like I, U.

A good next guess should:
1. Place A somewhere other than position 1.
2. Place S somewhere other than position 4.
3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels.

A word like ""STAIN"" comes to mind:
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since only position 4 was forbidden for S).
- T, I, N are new letters.
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since only position 1 was forbidden for A).

This should help us determine if S is in position 1, and test T, I, N.

Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) I(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, O, E, T, N  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, S, I (each appears once)

Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in position 1 (from AROSE) or position 3 (from STAIN)
- S cannot be in position 1 (from STAIN) or position 4 (from AROSE)
- I cannot be in position 4 (from STAIN)

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, S, I exactly once each and avoids the forbidden positions.  
We also need two additional distinct letters that have not been tested yet (to maximize information).

Good remaining consonants to try: L, C, D, B, M, P, etc.  
Good remaining vowels to try: U (since A and I are already used, and O and E are out).

A word that satisfies these constraints is “CLASP”:
- C and L are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 4 (but wait – position 4 was forbidden for S in AROSE). So CLASP is invalid.

Next candidate: “BLASP” – same issue with S in position 4.

Next candidate: “PLASM” – S is in position 4 again (invalid).

Next candidate: “SLUMP” – S is in position 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “CULPA” – A is in position 5 (allowed), S is in position 4 (invalid).

Next candidate: “LASIC” – S is in position 4 (invalid).

Next candidate: “CABIS” – S is in position 5 (allowed), A is in position 2 (allowed), I is in position 3 (allowed). This seems valid.

Let’s check CABIS:
- Letters: C, A, B, I, S – all distinct, none of the forbidden letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- I is in position 3 (allowed).
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- New letters introduced: C, B.

This should give us information about C, B and confirm the positions of A, I, S.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A word like ""AROSE"" or ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good starting word because it contains several of these high-frequency letters. 

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters that can help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: R, O, E
- Letters definitely present: A and S (but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively)
- Remaining letters to test: consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc., and vowels like I, U.

A good next guess should:
1. Place A somewhere other than position 1.
2. Place S somewhere other than position 4.
3. Introduce new common consonants and vowels.

A word like ""STAIN"" comes to mind:
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since only position 4 was forbidden for S).
- T, I, N are new letters.
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since only position 1 was forbidden for A).

This should help us determine if S is in position 1, and test T, I, N.

Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(-) I(-) N(x)

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, O, E, T, N  
Letters that ARE in the word: A, S, I (each appears once)

Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in position 1 (from AROSE) or position 3 (from STAIN)
- S cannot be in position 1 (from STAIN) or position 4 (from AROSE)
- I cannot be in position 4 (from STAIN)

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, S, I exactly once each and avoids the forbidden positions.  
We also need two additional distinct letters that have not been tested yet (to maximize information).

Good remaining consonants to try: L, C, D, B, M, P, etc.  
Good remaining vowels to try: U (since A and I are already used, and O and E are out).

A word that satisfies these constraints is “CLASP”:
- C and L are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- S is in position 4 (but wait – position 4 was forbidden for S in AROSE). So CLASP is invalid.

Next candidate: “BLASP” – same issue with S in position 4.

Next candidate: “PLASM” – S is in position 4 again (invalid).

Next candidate: “SLUMP” – S is in position 1 (invalid).

Next candidate: “CULPA” – A is in position 5 (allowed), S is in position 4 (invalid).

Next candidate: “LASIC” – S is in position 4 (invalid).

Next candidate: “CABIS” – S is in position 5 (allowed), A is in position 2 (allowed), I is in position 3 (allowed). This seems valid.

Let’s check CABIS:
- Letters: C, A, B, I, S – all distinct, none of the forbidden letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- I is in position 3 (allowed).
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- New letters introduced: C, B.

This should give us information about C, B and confirm the positions of A, I, S.

From the latest feedback:

- I is in the word but NOT in position 1 (from INGAS).
- N and G are NOT in the word (from INGAS).
- A is in position 4 (✓).
- S is in position 5 (✓).

Letters already confirmed:
- A (position 4)
- S (position 5)
- I (somewhere in positions 2 or 3)

Letters already ruled out:
R, O, E, T, N, C, B, L, M, N, G

Remaining unused letters: D, H, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Word structure: _ _ _ A S

I must be in position 2 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- _ I _ A S
- _ _ I A S

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting these patterns:

- D I _ A S → DIADS (valid word)
- H I _ A S → HIADS (not valid)
- P I _ A S → PIADS (not valid)
- U I _ A S → UIADS (not valid)
- D _ I A S → D _ I A S → D I _ A S already considered
- H _ I A S → H I _ A S already considered
- P _ I A S → P I _ A S already considered

The only valid word here is DIADS.

Check DIADS:
- D, I, A, D, S
- I is in position 2 (allowed)
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- S is in position 5 (allowed)
- D is new and not yet tested
- Second D is allowed since letters can repeat unless ruled out (none rule out D)

Therefore, DIADS is a valid next guess.
