For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains the vowels A, O, E and common consonants R, S. This gives me a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word on the first try.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd).
- O is NOT in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not 4th).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not 5th).

So the secret word contains the letters A, R, S, E but not O.  
We know:
- A is not in position 1.
- R is not in position 2.
- S is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

We also know the word is 5 letters long.  
A good next guess should place these four known letters in new positions while introducing a new letter that hasn’t been tested yet.  
A word that does this well is “EARLY”:
- E moves to position 1 (was 5).
- A moves to position 2 (was 1).
- R moves to position 3 (was 2).
- S is not in this word, so we’ll test a new letter L.
- Y is a new letter.

This gives us a fresh set of positions for the known letters and tests a new letter (Y) that hasn’t been used yet.

- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4  
- E cannot be in positions 1, 5  

That leaves the following possible positions for each known letter:

A: only position 4 is still open  
R: only position 5 is still open  
S: positions 2 or 5  
E: positions 2 or 3 or 4  

We still need a fifth letter that hasn’t been used yet. The most common unused consonants are N, C, D, U, I, etc.  
Let’s try to place all four known letters into the remaining valid slots and pick a new letter.

The only way to satisfy all constraints is to place:
- A in position 4  
- R in position 5  
- S and E in positions 2 and 3 (in some order)  
- and insert a new letter in the remaining slot.

The two possible arrangements are:
- S E A R _ → “SEAR_” (needs a 5th letter)  
- E S A R _ → “ESAR_” (needs a 5th letter)

We need a 5th letter that hasn’t been tried yet. The most frequent unused letter is N.  
So the word must be “SEARN” or “ESARN”.  
The only valid English word among these is “SEARN” (which is not a recognized word), so we must have made an error in assumption.

Let’s re-examine the constraints more carefully.

Actually, the positions are:
1 2 3 4 5

We have:
- A cannot be 1,2,3 → must be 4 or 5  
- R cannot be 2,3,4 → must be 1 or 5  
- S cannot be 1,4 → must be 2,3,5  
- E cannot be 1,5 → must be 2,3,4  

We still need a fifth letter.  
Let’s list all possible placements:

Case 1: R in 1
Then:
- A must be 4 or 5  
- S must be 2,3,5  
- E must be 2,3,4  

Subcase 1a: A in 4
Then:
- S must be 2 or 3 or 5  
- E must be 2 or 3  

If S in 2:
- E must be 3 or 5, but 5 is open for E, but we need 5th letter
- Word: R S E A _ → “RSEAX” (X is new letter)
- Need a 5th letter, say N → “RSEAN” (not valid)

If S in 3:
- E must be 2 or 5
- Word: R E S A _ → “RESAX” (X is new letter)
- Need a 5th letter, say N → “RESAN” (not valid)

If S in 5:
- E must be 2 or 3
- Word: R _ E A S
- E in 2: R E E A S (invalid)
- E in 3: R _ E A S → “R E _ A S” → “REBAS” (invalid)

Case 1b: A in 5
Then:
- S must be 2,3,5 → 5 is taken by A → S in 2 or 3
- E must be 2,3,4

If S in 2:
- E must be 3 or 4
- Word: R S E _ A or R S _ E A
- R S E _ A → “RSE_A” → need 4th letter, say N → “RSENA” (not valid)
- R S _ E A → “RS_EA” → “RSNEA” (not valid)

If S in 3:
- E must be 2 or 4
- Word: R _ S E A or R E S A (but A is 5)
- R _ S E A → “R _ S E A” → need 2nd letter, say N → “R N S E A” → “RNS EA” (invalid)

Case 2: R in 5
Then:
- A must be 4 (since 1,2,3 are invalid)
- S must be 2,3
- E must be 2,3,4

So:
- A is 4
- R is 5
- S must be 2 or 3
- E must be 2,3

If S in 2:
- E must be 3
- Word: _ S E A R → need 1st letter, say N → “NSEAR” (invalid)

If S in 3:
- E must be 2
- Word: _ E S A R → need 1st letter, say N → “NESAR” (invalid)

None of these are valid English words.  
Let’s try a different approach: look for common 5-letter words that contain A, R, S, E and no O, L, Y, T.

The only common word that fits is “EARNS”:
- E A R N S  
Check constraints:
- A is in position 2 (was 1,2,3 → ok)  
- R is in position 3 (was 2,3,4 → ok)  
- S is in position 5 (was 1,4 → ok)  
- E is in position 1 (was 1,5 → ok)  
- N is new letter  

This satisfies all constraints.

Known letters in the word: A, R, S, E  
Known letters NOT in the word: O, L, Y, T  

Position constraints (from the three guesses):

- R cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4  
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4  
- E cannot be in positions 1, 5  

That leaves the following possible positions for each known letter:

A: only position 4 is still open  
R: only position 5 is still open  
S: positions 2 or 5  
E: positions 2 or 3 or 4  

We still need a fifth letter that hasn’t been used yet. The most common unused consonants are N, C, D, U, I, etc.  
Let’s try to place all four known letters into the remaining valid slots and pick a new letter.

The only way to satisfy all constraints is to place:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains the vowels A, O, E and common consonants R, S. This gives me a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word on the first try.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd).
- O is NOT in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not 4th).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not 5th).

So the secret word contains the letters A, R, S, E but not O.  
We know:
- A is not in position 1.
- R is not in position 2.
- S is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

We also know the word is 5 letters long.  
A good next guess should place these four known letters in new positions while introducing a new letter that hasn’t been tested yet.  
A word that does this well is “EARLY”:
- E moves to position 1 (was 5).
- A moves to position 2 (was 1).
- R moves to position 3 (was 2).
- S is not in this word, so we’ll test a new letter L.
- Y is a new letter.

This gives us a fresh set of positions for the known letters and tests a new letter (Y) that hasn’t been used yet.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, S, E
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, L, Y
- Position constraints:
  – A is NOT in position 1 or 2
  – R is NOT in position 2 or 3
  – S is NOT in position 4
  – E is NOT in position 1 or 5

We still need to place A, R, S, E into the remaining slots and find a fifth letter that hasn’t been tested yet.  
The remaining unused common letters are T, N, I, C, D, U, etc.  
A good candidate word that uses all four known letters in new positions and introduces a fresh letter is “STARE”:
- S in position 1 (new position)
- T (new letter)
- A in position 3 (new position)
- R in position 4 (new position)
- E in position 5 (new position)

This satisfies all constraints and tests T as a new letter.

That leaves the following possible positions for each known letter:

A: only position 4 is still open  
R: only position 5 is still open  
S: positions 2 or 5  
E: positions 2 or 3 or 4  

We still need a fifth letter that hasn’t been used yet. The most common unused consonants are N, C, D, U, I, etc.  
Let’s try to place all four known letters into the remaining valid slots and pick a new letter.

The only way to satisfy all constraints is to place:
- A in position 4  
- R in position 5  
- S and E in positions 2 and 3 (in some order)  
- and insert a new letter in the remaining slot.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains the vowels A, O, E and common consonants R, S. This gives me a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word on the first try.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd).
- O is NOT in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (not 4th).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (not 5th).

So the secret word contains the letters A, R, S, E but not O.  
We know:
- A is not in position 1.
- R is not in position 2.
- S is not in position 4.
- E is not in position 5.

We also know the word is 5 letters long.  
A good next guess should place these four known letters in new positions while introducing a new letter that hasn’t been tested yet.  
A word that does this well is “EARLY”:
- E moves to position 1 (was 5).
- A moves to position 2 (was 1).
- R moves to position 3 (was 2).
- S is not in this word, so we’ll test a new letter L.
- Y is a new letter.

This gives us a fresh set of positions for the known letters and tests a new letter (Y) that hasn’t been used yet.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, S, E
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, L, Y
- Position constraints:
  – A is NOT in position 1 or 2
  – R is NOT in position 2 or 3
  – S is NOT in position 4
  – E is NOT in position 1 or 5

We still need to place A, R, S, E into the remaining slots and find a fifth letter that hasn’t been tested yet.  
The remaining unused common letters are T, N, I, C, D, U, etc.  
A good candidate word that uses all four known letters in new positions and introduces a fresh letter is “STARE”:
- S in position 1 (new position)
- T (new letter)
- A in position 3 (new position)
- R in position 4 (new position)
- E in position 5 (new position)

This satisfies all constraints and tests T as a new letter.

Let’s summarize what we now know after three guesses.

Known letters in the word: A, R, S, E  
Known letters NOT in the word: O, L, Y, T  

Position constraints (from the three guesses):
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3  
- R cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4  
- S cannot be in positions 1 or 4  
- E cannot be in positions 1, 5  

That leaves the following possible positions for each known letter:

A: only position 4 is still open  
R: only position 5 is still open  
S: positions 2 or 5  
E: positions 2 or 3 or 4  

We still need a fifth letter that hasn’t been used yet. The most common unused consonants are N, C, D, U, I, etc.  
Let’s try to place all four known letters into the remaining valid slots and pick a new letter.

The only way to satisfy all constraints is to place:
- A in position 4  
- R in position 5  
- S and E in positions 2 and 3 (in some order)  
- and insert a new letter in the remaining slot.

The two possible arrangements are:
- S E A R _ → “SEAR_” (needs a 5th letter)  
- E S A R _ → “ESAR_” (needs a 5th letter)

We need a 5th letter that hasn’t been tried yet. The most frequent unused letter is N.  
So the word must be “SEARN” or “ESARN”.  
The only valid English word among these is “SEARN” (which is not a recognized word), so we must have made an error in assumption.

Let’s re-examine the constraints more carefully.

Actually, the positions are:
1 2 3 4 5

We have:
- A cannot be 1,2,3 → must be 4 or 5  
- R cannot be 2,3,4 → must be 1 or 5  
- S cannot be 1,4 → must be 2,3,5  
- E cannot be 1,5 → must be 2,3,4  

We still need a fifth letter.  
Let’s list all possible placements:

Case 1: R in 1
Then:
- A must be 4 or 5  
- S must be 2,3,5  
- E must be 2,3,4  

Subcase 1a: A in 4
Then:
- S must be 2 or 3 or 5  
- E must be 2 or 3  

If S in 2:
- E must be 3 or 5, but 5 is open for E, but we need 5th letter
- Word: R S E A _ → “RSEAX” (X is new letter)
- Need a 5th letter, say N → “RSEAN” (not valid)

If S in 3:
- E must be 2 or 5
- Word: R E S A _ → “RESAX” (X is new letter)
- Need a 5th letter, say N → “RESAN” (not valid)

If S in 5:
- E must be 2 or 3
- Word: R _ E A S
- E in 2: R E E A S (invalid)
- E in 3: R _ E A S → “R E _ A S” → “REBAS” (invalid)

Case 1b: A in 5
Then:
- S must be 2,3,5 → 5 is taken by A → S in 2 or 3
- E must be 2,3,4

If S in 2:
- E must be 3 or 4
- Word: R S E _ A or R S _ E A
- R S E _ A → “RSE_A” → need 4th letter, say N → “RSENA” (not valid)
- R S _ E A → “RS_EA” → “RSNEA” (not valid)

If S in 3:
- E must be 2 or 4
- Word: R _ S E A or R E S A (but A is 5)
- R _ S E A → “R _ S E A” → need 2nd letter, say N → “R N S E A” → “RNS EA” (invalid)

Case 2: R in 5
Then:
- A must be 4 (since 1,2,3 are invalid)
- S must be 2,3
- E must be 2,3,4

So:
- A is 4
- R is 5
- S must be 2 or 3
- E must be 2,3

If S in 2:
- E must be 3
- Word: _ S E A R → need 1st letter, say N → “NSEAR” (invalid)

If S in 3:
- E must be 2
- Word: _ E S A R → need 1st letter, say N → “NESAR” (invalid)

None of these are valid English words.  
Let’s try a different approach: look for common 5-letter words that contain A, R, S, E and no O, L, Y, T.

The only common word that fits is “EARNS”:
- E A R N S  
Check constraints:
- A is in position 2 (was 1,2,3 → ok)  
- R is in position 3 (was 2,3,4 → ok)  
- S is in position 5 (was 1,4 → ok)  
- E is in position 1 (was 1,5 → ok)  
- N is new letter  

This satisfies all constraints.

We still need a fifth letter for position 2 or 3, and it must be a new letter not yet tried. The unused common consonants are C, D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

From the feedback on REGAS:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- G is not in the word.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the word is now fully determined:
Position 1: R
Position 2: E
Position 3: ?
Position 4: A
Position 5: S

We need to find a single letter for position 3 that has not been used or ruled out yet. The letters already ruled out are O, L, Y, T, N, G. The remaining common consonants are C, D, F, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

Looking at common 5-letter words starting with RE and ending with AS:
- RECAP, REACT, REBEL, REBUS, RECAP, RECAP, etc.

But we need to check which of these fit:
- RECAP: C is allowed
- REACT: C is allowed
- REBEL: B is allowed
- REBUS: B is allowed
- RECAP: C is allowed
- RECAP: C is allowed

Among these, ""RECAP"" is a valid word and uses C, which hasn't been ruled out yet.
