1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words use frequently occurring vowels and consonants to help identify which letters are in the secret word.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 consonants (R, S) which are also common
- No repeated letters, maximizing the chance of getting hits

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (position 4).
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains A and S.
2. A is NOT in position 1.
3. S is NOT in position 4.
4. R, O, E are not in the word.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes A and S.
- Does NOT include R, O, E.
- Has A not in position 1.
- Has S not in position 4.

Good next candidates might be words like:
- STAIN (but has I and N which might not be optimal)
- SLANT (but has L and N)
- STASH (but has H and S again)
- SAINT (but has I and N)
- STAND (but has N and D)

Looking for common letters not yet ruled out, let's try ""STAIN"":
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since S only needs to avoid position 4)
- T is new
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since A only needs to avoid position 1)
- I is new
- N is new

This seems like a good second guess to test new letters while placing S and A in new positions.

Summary of constraints:

- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N.
- Positions ruled out for S: 1 and 4.
- Positions ruled out for A: 1 (already fixed in 3, so no conflict).

Remaining consonants to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 3.
- S somewhere in positions 2, 3, 5 (but 3 is already A, so 2 or 5).
- No R, O, E, T, I, N.

Possible patterns:
- _ S A _ _
- _ _ A S _

Let’s list common 5-letter words fitting _ S A _ _ or _ _ A S _ without forbidden letters.

Examples:
- C S A _ _  → CSA?  Not a word.
- D S A _ _  → DSA?  Not a word.
- L S A _ _  → LSA?  Not a word.
- P S A _ _  → PSA?  Not a word.
- B S A _ _  → BSA?  Not a word.
- G S A _ _  → GSA?  Not a word.
- M S A _ _  → MSA?  Not a word.
- F S A _ _  → FSA?  Not a word.
- K S A _ _  → KSA?  Not a word.
- H S A _ _  → HSA?  Not a word.
- J S A _ _  → JSA?  Not a word.
- Q S A _ _  → QSA?  Not a word.
- U S A _ _  → USA?  Not 5 letters.
- V S A _ _  → VSA?  Not a word.
- W S A _ _  → WSA?  Not a word.
- X S A _ _  → XSA?  Not a word.
- Y S A _ _  → YSA?  Not a word.
- Z S A _ _  → ZSA?  Not a word.

Now check _ _ A S _ pattern:
- _ _ A S _
  - First letter: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
  - Second letter: same set, but must not repeat forbidden letters.
  - Third letter: A (fixed).
  - Fourth letter: S.
  - Fifth letter: any remaining consonant or vowel not forbidden.

Common words:
- B A S _ _  → B A S?  Not 5 letters.
- C A S _ _  → C A S?  Not 5 letters.
- D A S _ _  → D A S?  Not 5 letters.
- F A S _ _  → F A S?  Not 5 letters.
- G A S _ _  → G A S?  Not 5 letters.
- H A S _ _  → H A S?  Not 5 letters.
- J A S _ _  → J A S?  Not 5 letters.
- K A S _ _  → K A S?  Not 5 letters.
- L A S _ _  → L A S?  Not 5 letters.
- M A S _ _  → M A S?  Not 5 letters.
- P A S _ _  → P A S?  Not 5 letters.
- Q A S _ _  → Q A S?  Not 5 letters.
- U A S _ _  → U A S?  Not 5 letters.
- V A S _ _  → V A S?  Not 5 letters.
- W A S _ _  → W A S?  Not 5 letters.
- X A S _ _  → X A S?  Not 5 letters.
- Y A S _ _  → Y A S?  Not 5 letters.
- Z A S _ _  → Z A S?  Not 5 letters.

Hmm, none of these seem to work. Maybe I missed some words.

Alternative approach: look for 5-letter words with A in position 3 and S in position 2 or 5, avoiding forbidden letters.

- S A _ _ _  → but S cannot be in position 1 (from feedback).
- _ S A _ _  → possible.
- _ _ A S _  → possible.

Let me think of actual words:
- _ S A _ _  examples:
  - C S A _ _  → CSA?  Not a word.
  - D S A _ _  → DSA?  Not a word.
  - F S A _ _  → FSA?  Not a word.
  - G S A _ _  → GSA?  Not a word.
  - H S A _ _  → HSA?  Not a word.
  - J S A _ _  → JSA?  Not a word.
  - K S A _ _  → KSA?  Not a word.
  - L S A _ _  → LSA?  Not a word.
  - M S A _ _  → MSA?  Not a word.
  - P S A _ _  → PSA?  Not a word.
  - Q S A _ _  → QSA?  Not a word.
  - U S A _ _  → USA?  Not 5 letters.
  - V S A _ _  → VSA?  Not a word.
  - W S A _ _  → WSA?  Not a word.
  - X S A _ _  → XSA?  Not a word.
  - Y S A _ _  → YSA?  Not a word.
  - Z S A _ _  → ZSA?  Not a word.

- _ _ A S _  examples:
  - B A S _ _  → B A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - C A S _ _  → C A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - D A S _ _  → D A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - F A S _ _  → F A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - G A S _ _  → G A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - H A S _ _  → H A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - J A S _ _  → J A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - K A S _ _  → K A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - L A S _ _  → L A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - M A S _ _  → M A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - P A S _ _  → P A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - Q A S _ _  → Q A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - U A S _ _  → U A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - V A S _ _  → V A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - W A S _ _  → W A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - X A S _ _  → X A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - Y A S _ _  → Y A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - Z A S _ _  → Z A S?  Not 5 letters.

I think I need to consider that maybe the word has S in position 5.

Let me try _ _ A _ S pattern:
- _ _ A _ S  with no forbidden letters.

Possible words:
- C L A R S  → but R is forbidden.
- C H A L S  → H is allowed, but L is allowed, A is allowed, S is allowed.
- C H A L S  is a valid word (variant of ""chase"" or ""chals"").
- D O A R S  → O is forbidden.
- F L A K S  → F, L, A, K, S.  K is allowed, F is allowed, L is allowed, A is allowed, S is allowed.  FLASK is a valid word.
- G L A D S  → D is allowed, but G, L, A, D, S.  GLADS is valid.
- H A R D S  → R is forbidden.
- J U A L S  → J, U, A, L, S.  JUALS is not a word.
- K L A P S  → K, L, A, P, S.  KLAPS is valid.
- M A R S  → too short.
- P L A N S  → N is forbidden.
- Q U A L S  → Q, U, A, L, S.  QUALS is valid.
- U N A S S  → N is forbidden.
- V A L S  → too short.
- W A L K S  → K is allowed, W, A, L, K, S.  WALKS is valid.
- X A L S  → too short.
- Y A R S  → R is forbidden.
- Z E A L S  → E is forbidden.

From these, valid words avoiding forbidden letters:
- CHALS
- FLASK
- GLADS
- KLAPS
- QUALS
- WALKS

Among these, ""FLASK"" is a common word and uses F, L, A, S, K.  All letters are allowed.

Let me choose FLASK.

Based on the feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 3.
- S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.
- Forbidden letters: R, O, E, T, I, N.

- _ S A _ _
- _ _ A S _

Let’s list common 5-letter words fitting _ S A _ _ or _ _ A S _ without forbidden letters.

Examples:
- C S A _ _  → CSA?  Not a word.
- D S A _ _  → DSA?  Not a word.
- L S A _ _  → LSA?  Not a word.
- P S A _ _  → PSA?  Not a word.

- F S A _ _  → FSA?  Not a word.
- K S A _ _  → KSA?  Not a word.
- H S A _ _  → HSA?  Not a word.
- J S A _ _  → JSA?  Not a word.
- Q S A _ _  → QSA?  Not a word.
- U S A _ _  → USA?  Not 5 letters.
- V S A _ _  → VSA?  Not a word.
- W S A _ _  → WSA?  Not a word.
- X S A _ _  → XSA?  Not a word.
- Y S A _ _  → YSA?  Not a word.
- Z S A _ _  → ZSA?  Not a word.

Now check _ _ A S _ pattern:
- _ _ A S _
  - First letter: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
  - Second letter: same set, but must not repeat forbidden letters.
  - Third letter: A (fixed).
  - Fourth letter: S.
  - Fifth letter: any remaining consonant or vowel not forbidden.

Common words:
- B A S _ _  → B A S?  Not 5 letters.
- C A S _ _  → C A S?  Not 5 letters.
- D A S _ _  → D A S?  Not 5 letters.
- F A S _ _  → F A S?  Not 5 letters.
- G A S _ _  → G A S?  Not 5 letters.
- H A S _ _  → H A S?  Not 5 letters.
- J A S _ _  → J A S?  Not 5 letters.
- K A S _ _  → K A S?  Not 5 letters.
- L A S _ _  → L A S?  Not 5 letters.
- M A S _ _  → M A S?  Not 5 letters.
- P A S _ _  → P A S?  Not 5 letters.
- Q A S _ _  → Q A S?  Not 5 letters.
- U A S _ _  → U A S?  Not 5 letters.
- V A S _ _  → V A S?  Not 5 letters.
- W A S _ _  → W A S?  Not 5 letters.
- X A S _ _  → X A S?  Not 5 letters.
- Y A S _ _  → Y A S?  Not 5 letters.
- Z A S _ _  → Z A S?  Not 5 letters.

Hmm, none of these seem to work. Maybe I missed some words.

Alternative approach: look for 5-letter words with A in position 3 and S in position 2 or 5, avoiding forbidden letters.

- S A _ _ _  → but S cannot be in position 1 (from feedback).
- _ S A _ _  → possible.
- _ _ A S _  → possible.

Let me think of actual words:
- _ S A _ _  examples:

  - Z A S _ _  → Z A S?  Not 5 letters.

I think I need to consider that maybe the word has S in position 5.

Let me try _ _ A _ S pattern:
- _ _ A _ S  with no forbidden letters.

Possible words:
- C L A R S  → but R is forbidden.
- C H A L S  → H is allowed, but L is allowed, A is allowed, S is allowed.
- C H A L S  is a valid word (variant of ""chase"" or ""chals"").
- D O A R S  → O is forbidden.
- F L A K S  → F, L, A, K, S.  K is allowed, F is allowed, L is allowed, A is allowed, S is allowed.  FLASK is a valid word.
- G L A D S  → D is allowed, but G, L, A, D, S.  GLADS is valid.
- H A R D S  → R is forbidden.
- J U A L S  → J, U, A, L, S.  JUALS is not a word.
- K L A P S  → K, L, A, P, S.  KLAPS is valid.
- M A R S  → too short.
- P L A N S  → N is forbidden.
- Q U A L S  → Q, U, A, L, S.  QUALS is valid.
- U N A S S  → N is forbidden.
- V A L S  → too short.
- W A L K S  → K is allowed, W, A, L, K, S.  WALKS is valid.
- X A L S  → too short.
- Y A R S  → R is forbidden.
- Z E A L S  → E is forbidden.

From these, valid words avoiding forbidden letters:
- CHALS
- FLASK
- GLADS
- KLAPS
- QUALS
- WALKS

Among these, ""FLASK"" is a common word and uses F, L, A, S, K.  All letters are allowed.

Let me choose FLASK.Based on the feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 3.
- S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.
- Forbidden letters: R, O, E, T, I, N.

A valid word fitting _ _ A _ S is ""FLASK"".",Guess 3: FLASK -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) A(✓) S(-) K(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words use frequently occurring vowels and consonants to help identify which letters are in the secret word.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 consonants (R, S) which are also common
- No repeated letters, maximizing the chance of getting hits

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (position 4).
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains A and S.
2. A is NOT in position 1.
3. S is NOT in position 4.
4. R, O, E are not in the word.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes A and S.
- Does NOT include R, O, E.
- Has A not in position 1.
- Has S not in position 4.

Good next candidates might be words like:
- STAIN (but has I and N which might not be optimal)
- SLANT (but has L and N)
- STASH (but has H and S again)
- SAINT (but has I and N)
- STAND (but has N and D)

Looking for common letters not yet ruled out, let's try ""STAIN"":
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since S only needs to avoid position 4)
- T is new
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since A only needs to avoid position 1)
- I is new
- N is new

This seems like a good second guess to test new letters while placing S and A in new positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STAIN -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. STAIN → S(-) T(x) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
   - A is now confirmed in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - T, I, N are not in the word.

Summary of constraints:
- Letters known to be in the word: A (position 3 fixed), S.
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N.
- Positions ruled out for S: 1 and 4.
- Positions ruled out for A: 1 (already fixed in 3, so no conflict).

Remaining consonants to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 3.
- S somewhere in positions 2, 3, 5 (but 3 is already A, so 2 or 5).
- No R, O, E, T, I, N.

Possible patterns:
- _ S A _ _
- _ _ A S _

Let’s list common 5-letter words fitting _ S A _ _ or _ _ A S _ without forbidden letters.

- X S A _ _  → XSA?  Not a word.
- Y S A _ _  → YSA?  Not a word.
- Z S A _ _  → ZSA?  Not a word.

Now check _ _ A S _ pattern:
- _ _ A S _
  - First letter: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
  - Second letter: same set, but must not repeat forbidden letters.
  - Third letter: A (fixed).
  - Fourth letter: S.
  - Fifth letter: any remaining consonant or vowel not forbidden.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words use frequently occurring vowels and consonants to help identify which letters are in the secret word.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 consonants (R, S) which are also common
- No repeated letters, maximizing the chance of getting hits

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (position 4).
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains A and S.
2. A is NOT in position 1.
3. S is NOT in position 4.
4. R, O, E are not in the word.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes A and S.
- Does NOT include R, O, E.
- Has A not in position 1.
- Has S not in position 4.

Good next candidates might be words like:
- STAIN (but has I and N which might not be optimal)
- SLANT (but has L and N)
- STASH (but has H and S again)
- SAINT (but has I and N)
- STAND (but has N and D)

Looking for common letters not yet ruled out, let's try ""STAIN"":
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since S only needs to avoid position 4)
- T is new
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since A only needs to avoid position 1)
- I is new
- N is new

This seems like a good second guess to test new letters while placing S and A in new positions.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. STAIN → S(-) T(x) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
   - A is now confirmed in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - T, I, N are not in the word.

Summary of constraints:
- Letters known to be in the word: A (position 3 fixed), S.
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N.
- Positions ruled out for S: 1 and 4.
- Positions ruled out for A: 1 (already fixed in 3, so no conflict).

Remaining consonants to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 3.
- S somewhere in positions 2, 3, 5 (but 3 is already A, so 2 or 5).
- No R, O, E, T, I, N.

Possible patterns:
- _ S A _ _
- _ _ A S _

Let’s list common 5-letter words fitting _ S A _ _ or _ _ A S _ without forbidden letters.

  - First letter: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
  - Second letter: same set, but must not repeat forbidden letters.
  - Third letter: A (fixed).
  - Fourth letter: S.
  - Fifth letter: any remaining consonant or vowel not forbidden.

Common words:

Hmm, none of these seem to work. Maybe I missed some words.

Alternative approach: look for 5-letter words with A in position 3 and S in position 2 or 5, avoiding forbidden letters.

- S A _ _ _  → but S cannot be in position 1 (from feedback).
- _ S A _ _  → possible.
- _ _ A S _  → possible.

Let me think of actual words:
- _ S A _ _  examples:
  - C S A _ _  → CSA?  Not a word.
  - D S A _ _  → DSA?  Not a word.
  - F S A _ _  → FSA?  Not a word.

I think I need to consider that maybe the word has S in position 5.

Let me try _ _ A _ S pattern:
- _ _ A _ S  with no forbidden letters.

Possible words:
- C L A R S  → but R is forbidden.
- C H A L S  → H is allowed, but L is allowed, A is allowed, S is allowed.
- C H A L S  is a valid word (variant of ""chase"" or ""chals"").
- D O A R S  → O is forbidden.
- F L A K S  → F, L, A, K, S.  K is allowed, F is allowed, L is allowed, A is allowed, S is allowed.  FLASK is a valid word.
- G L A D S  → D is allowed, but G, L, A, D, S.  GLADS is valid.
- H A R D S  → R is forbidden.
- J U A L S  → J, U, A, L, S.  JUALS is not a word.
- K L A P S  → K, L, A, P, S.  KLAPS is valid.
- M A R S  → too short.
- P L A N S  → N is forbidden.
- Q U A L S  → Q, U, A, L, S.  QUALS is valid.
- U N A S S  → N is forbidden.
- V A L S  → too short.
- W A L K S  → K is allowed, W, A, L, K, S.  WALKS is valid.
- X A L S  → too short.
- Y A R S  → R is forbidden.
- Z E A L S  → E is forbidden.

From these, valid words avoiding forbidden letters:
- CHALS
- FLASK
- GLADS
- KLAPS
- QUALS
- WALKS

Among these, ""FLASK"" is a common word and uses F, L, A, S, K.  All letters are allowed.

Let me choose FLASK.Based on the feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 3.
- S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4.
- Forbidden letters: R, O, E, T, I, N.

A valid word fitting _ _ A _ S is ""FLASK"".

From all feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word, not in position 1.
   - S is in the word, not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. STAIN → S(-) T(x) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
   - A is in position 3.
   - S is in the word, not in position 1.
   - T, I, N are not in the word.

3. FLASK → F(x) L(-) A(✓) S(-) K(x)
   - A is still in position 3.
   - S is in the word, not in position 4 (confirmed) and not in position 1 (confirmed). So S must be in position 2 or 5.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - F, K are not in the word.

Forbidden letters so far: R, O, E, T, I, N, F, K.

Known pattern: _ _ A _ _ with A fixed at position 3, and S must be in position 2 or 5.

Possible patterns:
- S A _ _ _  → but S cannot be in position 1 (from STAIN feedback), so invalid.
- _ S A _ _  → S in position 2.
- _ _ A S _  → S in position 5.

Let’s explore both patterns.

Pattern 1: _ S A _ _
   - S is in position 2.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2 (already satisfied), so L must be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
   - Remaining letters must be from allowed set: B, C, D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding forbidden ones).

Possible words:
- B S A _ _  → BSA?  Not a word.
- C S A _ _  → CSA?  Not a word.
- D S A _ _  → DSA?  Not a word.
- G S A _ _  → GSA?  Not a word.
- H S A _ _  → HSA?  Not a word.
- J S A _ _  → JSA?  Not a word.
- L S A _ _  → LSA?  Not a word.
- M S A _ _  → MSA?  Not a word.
- P S A _ _  → PSA?  Not a word.
- Q S A _ _  → QSA?  Not a word.
- U S A _ _  → USA?  Not 5 letters.
- V S A _ _  → VSA?  Not a word.
- W S A _ _  → WSA?  Not a word.
- X S A _ _  → XSA?  Not a word.
- Y S A _ _  → YSA?  Not a word.
- Z S A _ _  → ZSA?  Not a word.

Pattern 2: _ _ A S _
   - S is in position 5.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2, so L must be in positions 1 or 4.
   - Remaining letters must be from allowed set.

Possible words:
- _ _ A S _
   - L must be in position 1 or 4.
   - Position 1: L _ A S _
   - Position 4: _ _ A S L

Examples:
- L _ A S _  → L B A S _  → LBAS?  Not a word.
- L C A S _  → LCAS?  Not a word.
- L D A S _  → LDAS?  Not a word.

- L X A S _  → LXAS?  Not a word.
- L Y A S _  → LYAS?  Not a word.
- L Z A S _  → LZAS?  Not a word.

- _ _ A S L
   - Position 1: B _ A S L  → B A S L?  Not a word.
   - C _ A S L  → C A S L?  Not a word.
   - D _ A S L  → D A S L?  Not a word.
   - G _ A S L  → G A S L?  Not a word.
   - H _ A S L  → H A S L?  Not a word.
   - J _ A S L  → J A S L?  Not a word.
   - M _ A S L  → M A S L?  Not a word.
   - P _ A S L  → P A S L?  Not a word.
   - Q _ A S L  → Q A S L?  Not a word.
   - U _ A S L  → U A S L?  Not a word.
   - V _ A S L  → V A S L?  Not a word.
   - W _ A S L  → W A S L?  Not a word.
   - X _ A S L  → X A S L?  Not a word.
   - Y _ A S L  → Y A S L?  Not a word.
   - Z _ A S L  → Z A S L?  Not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. I must have missed some.

Let me think differently: maybe S is in position 5 and L is in position 4.

Pattern: _ _ A _ S with L in position 4.

- _ _ A L S
   - Possible words:
   - B U A L S  → BUALS?  Not a word.
   - C H A L S  → CHALS is valid (variant of ""chase"").
   - D O A L S  → O is forbidden.
   - G L A L S  → GLALS?  Not a word.
   - H A L L S  → HALLS is valid.
   - M A L L S  → MALLS is valid.
   - P A L L S  → PALLS is valid.
   - W A L L S  → WALLS is valid.

From these, valid words avoiding forbidden letters: CHALS, HALLS, MALLS, PALLS, WALLS.

""CHALS"" uses C, H, A, L, S - all allowed letters.
""HALLS"" uses H, A, L, L, S - all allowed.
""MALLS"" uses M, A, L, L, S - all allowed.
""PALLS"" uses P, A, L, L, S - all allowed.
""WALLS"" uses W, A, L, L, S - all allowed.

Among these, ""CHALS"" seems the most straightforward.

Let me choose CHALS.

- Position 2: unknown, but must be a letter not in {R, O, E, T, I, N, F, K, C, H, L, S} (since S is already used in position 5 and L in position 4).
- Position 3: A (fixed).

- QUALS (but Q is allowed, U, A, L, S)
- VAILS (but I is forbidden)
- WALES (but E is forbidden)
- XAILS (invalid)

""QUALS"" seems to be the only valid word left: Q, U, A, L, S.

Check if Q is allowed: yes, Q hasn't been ruled out.
Check if U is allowed: yes, U hasn't been ruled out.
Check if A, L, S are allowed: yes, they are confirmed in positions 3, 4, 5.

Therefore, the only possible word is ""QUALS"".

Based on the feedback, the pattern is now _ _ A L S with A in position 3, L in position 4, and S in position 5. The remaining letters for positions 1 and 2 must come from the allowed set {B, D, G, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}. The only valid word that fits is ""QUALS"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and maximizes information gain. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words use frequently occurring vowels and consonants to help identify which letters are in the secret word.

I'll choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 consonants (R, S) which are also common
- No repeated letters, maximizing the chance of getting hits

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1).
- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (position 4).
- E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains A and S.
2. A is NOT in position 1.
3. S is NOT in position 4.
4. R, O, E are not in the word.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes A and S.
- Does NOT include R, O, E.
- Has A not in position 1.
- Has S not in position 4.

Good next candidates might be words like:
- STAIN (but has I and N which might not be optimal)
- SLANT (but has L and N)
- STASH (but has H and S again)
- SAINT (but has I and N)
- STAND (but has N and D)

Looking for common letters not yet ruled out, let's try ""STAIN"":
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since S only needs to avoid position 4)
- T is new
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since A only needs to avoid position 1)
- I is new
- N is new

This seems like a good second guess to test new letters while placing S and A in new positions.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

   - A is now confirmed in position 3.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - T, I, N are not in the word.

Summary of constraints:
- Letters known to be in the word: A (position 3 fixed), S.
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N.
- Positions ruled out for S: 1 and 4.
- Positions ruled out for A: 1 (already fixed in 3, so no conflict).

Remaining consonants to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 3.
- S somewhere in positions 2, 3, 5 (but 3 is already A, so 2 or 5).
- No R, O, E, T, I, N.

Possible patterns:
- _ S A _ _
- _ _ A S _

Let’s list common 5-letter words fitting _ S A _ _ or _ _ A S _ without forbidden letters.

Examples:
- C S A _ _  → CSA?  Not a word.
- D S A _ _  → DSA?  Not a word.
- L S A _ _  → LSA?  Not a word.
- P S A _ _  → PSA?  Not a word.
- B S A _ _  → BSA?  Not a word.
- G S A _ _  → GSA?  Not a word.
- M S A _ _  → MSA?  Not a word.
- F S A _ _  → FSA?  Not a word.
- K S A _ _  → KSA?  Not a word.
- H S A _ _  → HSA?  Not a word.
- J S A _ _  → JSA?  Not a word.
- Q S A _ _  → QSA?  Not a word.
- U S A _ _  → USA?  Not 5 letters.
- V S A _ _  → VSA?  Not a word.
- W S A _ _  → WSA?  Not a word.
- X S A _ _  → XSA?  Not a word.
- Y S A _ _  → YSA?  Not a word.
- Z S A _ _  → ZSA?  Not a word.

Now check _ _ A S _ pattern:
- _ _ A S _
  - First letter: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
  - Second letter: same set, but must not repeat forbidden letters.
  - Third letter: A (fixed).
  - Fourth letter: S.
  - Fifth letter: any remaining consonant or vowel not forbidden.

Common words:
- B A S _ _  → B A S?  Not 5 letters.
- C A S _ _  → C A S?  Not 5 letters.
- D A S _ _  → D A S?  Not 5 letters.
- F A S _ _  → F A S?  Not 5 letters.
- G A S _ _  → G A S?  Not 5 letters.
- H A S _ _  → H A S?  Not 5 letters.
- J A S _ _  → J A S?  Not 5 letters.
- K A S _ _  → K A S?  Not 5 letters.
- L A S _ _  → L A S?  Not 5 letters.
- M A S _ _  → M A S?  Not 5 letters.
- P A S _ _  → P A S?  Not 5 letters.
- Q A S _ _  → Q A S?  Not 5 letters.
- U A S _ _  → U A S?  Not 5 letters.
- V A S _ _  → V A S?  Not 5 letters.
- W A S _ _  → W A S?  Not 5 letters.
- X A S _ _  → X A S?  Not 5 letters.
- Y A S _ _  → Y A S?  Not 5 letters.
- Z A S _ _  → Z A S?  Not 5 letters.

Hmm, none of these seem to work. Maybe I missed some words.

Alternative approach: look for 5-letter words with A in position 3 and S in position 2 or 5, avoiding forbidden letters.

- S A _ _ _  → but S cannot be in position 1 (from feedback).
- _ S A _ _  → possible.
- _ _ A S _  → possible.

Let me think of actual words:
- _ S A _ _  examples:
  - C S A _ _  → CSA?  Not a word.
  - D S A _ _  → DSA?  Not a word.
  - F S A _ _  → FSA?  Not a word.
  - G S A _ _  → GSA?  Not a word.
  - H S A _ _  → HSA?  Not a word.
  - J S A _ _  → JSA?  Not a word.
  - K S A _ _  → KSA?  Not a word.
  - L S A _ _  → LSA?  Not a word.
  - M S A _ _  → MSA?  Not a word.
  - P S A _ _  → PSA?  Not a word.
  - Q S A _ _  → QSA?  Not a word.
  - U S A _ _  → USA?  Not 5 letters.
  - V S A _ _  → VSA?  Not a word.
  - W S A _ _  → WSA?  Not a word.
  - X S A _ _  → XSA?  Not a word.
  - Y S A _ _  → YSA?  Not a word.
  - Z S A _ _  → ZSA?  Not a word.

- _ _ A S _  examples:

  - C A S _ _  → C A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - D A S _ _  → D A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - F A S _ _  → F A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - G A S _ _  → G A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - H A S _ _  → H A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - J A S _ _  → J A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - K A S _ _  → K A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - L A S _ _  → L A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - M A S _ _  → M A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - P A S _ _  → P A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - Q A S _ _  → Q A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - U A S _ _  → U A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - V A S _ _  → V A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - W A S _ _  → W A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - X A S _ _  → X A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - Y A S _ _  → Y A S?  Not 5 letters.
  - Z A S _ _  → Z A S?  Not 5 letters.

I think I need to consider that maybe the word has S in position 5.

Let me try _ _ A _ S pattern:
- _ _ A _ S  with no forbidden letters.

Possible words:
- C L A R S  → but R is forbidden.
- C H A L S  → H is allowed, but L is allowed, A is allowed, S is allowed.
- C H A L S  is a valid word (variant of ""chase"" or ""chals"").
- D O A R S  → O is forbidden.
- F L A K S  → F, L, A, K, S.  K is allowed, F is allowed, L is allowed, A is allowed, S is allowed.  FLASK is a valid word.
- G L A D S  → D is allowed, but G, L, A, D, S.  GLADS is valid.
- H A R D S  → R is forbidden.
- J U A L S  → J, U, A, L, S.  JUALS is not a word.
- K L A P S  → K, L, A, P, S.  KLAPS is valid.
- M A R S  → too short.
- P L A N S  → N is forbidden.
- Q U A L S  → Q, U, A, L, S.  QUALS is valid.
- U N A S S  → N is forbidden.
- V A L S  → too short.
- W A L K S  → K is allowed, W, A, L, K, S.  WALKS is valid.
- X A L S  → too short.
- Y A R S  → R is forbidden.
- Z E A L S  → E is forbidden.

From these, valid words avoiding forbidden letters:
- CHALS
- FLASK
- GLADS
- KLAPS
- QUALS
- WALKS

Among these, ""FLASK"" is a common word and uses F, L, A, S, K.  All letters are allowed.

Let me choose FLASK.Based on the feedback:

From all feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word, not in position 1.
   - S is in the word, not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. STAIN → S(-) T(x) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
   - A is in position 3.
   - S is in the word, not in position 1.
   - T, I, N are not in the word.

3. FLASK → F(x) L(-) A(✓) S(-) K(x)
   - A is still in position 3.
   - S is in the word, not in position 4 (confirmed) and not in position 1 (confirmed). So S must be in position 2 or 5.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - F, K are not in the word.

Forbidden letters so far: R, O, E, T, I, N, F, K.

Known pattern: _ _ A _ _ with A fixed at position 3, and S must be in position 2 or 5.

Possible patterns:
- S A _ _ _  → but S cannot be in position 1 (from STAIN feedback), so invalid.
- _ S A _ _  → S in position 2.
- _ _ A S _  → S in position 5.

Let’s explore both patterns.

Pattern 1: _ S A _ _
   - S is in position 2.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2 (already satisfied), so L must be in positions 1, 4, or 5.
   - Remaining letters must be from allowed set: B, C, D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding forbidden ones).

Possible words:
- B S A _ _  → BSA?  Not a word.
- C S A _ _  → CSA?  Not a word.
- D S A _ _  → DSA?  Not a word.
- G S A _ _  → GSA?  Not a word.
- H S A _ _  → HSA?  Not a word.
- J S A _ _  → JSA?  Not a word.
- L S A _ _  → LSA?  Not a word.
- M S A _ _  → MSA?  Not a word.
- P S A _ _  → PSA?  Not a word.
- Q S A _ _  → QSA?  Not a word.
- U S A _ _  → USA?  Not 5 letters.
- V S A _ _  → VSA?  Not a word.
- W S A _ _  → WSA?  Not a word.
- X S A _ _  → XSA?  Not a word.
- Y S A _ _  → YSA?  Not a word.
- Z S A _ _  → ZSA?  Not a word.

Pattern 2: _ _ A S _
   - S is in position 5.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2, so L must be in positions 1 or 4.
   - Remaining letters must be from allowed set.

Possible words:
- _ _ A S _
   - L must be in position 1 or 4.
   - Position 1: L _ A S _
   - Position 4: _ _ A S L

Examples:
- L _ A S _  → L B A S _  → LBAS?  Not a word.
- L C A S _  → LCAS?  Not a word.
- L D A S _  → LDAS?  Not a word.
- L G A S _  → LGAS?  Not a word.
- L H A S _  → LHAS?  Not a word.
- L J A S _  → LJAS?  Not a word.
- L M A S _  → LMAS?  Not a word.
- L P A S _  → LPAS?  Not a word.
- L Q A S _  → LQAS?  Not a word.
- L U A S _  → LUAS?  Not a word.
- L V A S _  → LVAS?  Not a word.
- L W A S _  → LWAS?  Not a word.
- L X A S _  → LXAS?  Not a word.
- L Y A S _  → LYAS?  Not a word.
- L Z A S _  → LZAS?  Not a word.

- _ _ A S L
   - Position 1: B _ A S L  → B A S L?  Not a word.
   - C _ A S L  → C A S L?  Not a word.
   - D _ A S L  → D A S L?  Not a word.
   - G _ A S L  → G A S L?  Not a word.
   - H _ A S L  → H A S L?  Not a word.
   - J _ A S L  → J A S L?  Not a word.
   - M _ A S L  → M A S L?  Not a word.
   - P _ A S L  → P A S L?  Not a word.
   - Q _ A S L  → Q A S L?  Not a word.
   - U _ A S L  → U A S L?  Not a word.
   - V _ A S L  → V A S L?  Not a word.
   - W _ A S L  → W A S L?  Not a word.
   - X _ A S L  → X A S L?  Not a word.
   - Y _ A S L  → Y A S L?  Not a word.
   - Z _ A S L  → Z A S L?  Not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. I must have missed some.

Let me think differently: maybe S is in position 5 and L is in position 4.

Pattern: _ _ A _ S with L in position 4.

- _ _ A L S
   - Possible words:
   - B U A L S  → BUALS?  Not a word.
   - C H A L S  → CHALS is valid (variant of ""chase"").
   - D O A L S  → O is forbidden.
   - G L A L S  → GLALS?  Not a word.
   - H A L L S  → HALLS is valid.
   - M A L L S  → MALLS is valid.
   - P A L L S  → PALLS is valid.
   - W A L L S  → WALLS is valid.

From these, valid words avoiding forbidden letters: CHALS, HALLS, MALLS, PALLS, WALLS.

""CHALS"" uses C, H, A, L, S - all allowed letters.
""HALLS"" uses H, A, L, L, S - all allowed.
""MALLS"" uses M, A, L, L, S - all allowed.
""PALLS"" uses P, A, L, L, S - all allowed.
""WALLS"" uses W, A, L, L, S - all allowed.

Among these, ""CHALS"" seems the most straightforward.

Let me choose CHALS.

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word, not in position 1.
   - S is in the word, not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. STAIN → S(-) T(x) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
   - A is in position 3.
   - S is in the word, not in position 1.
   - T, I, N are not in the word.

3. FLASK → F(x) L(-) A(✓) S(-) K(x)
   - A is still in position 3.
   - S is in the word, not in position 4 (confirmed) and not in position 1 (confirmed). So S must be in position 2 or 5.
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - F, K are not in the word.

4. CHALS → C(x) H(x) A(✓) L(✓) S(✓)
   - A is in position 3 (confirmed).
   - L is in position 4 (confirmed).
   - S is in position 5 (confirmed).
   - C, H are not in the word.

So the pattern is now:
- Position 1: unknown, but must be a letter not in {R, O, E, T, I, N, F, K, C, H}.
- Position 2: unknown, but must be a letter not in {R, O, E, T, I, N, F, K, C, H, L, S} (since S is already used in position 5 and L in position 4).
- Position 3: A (fixed).
- Position 4: L (fixed).
- Position 5: S (fixed).

Forbidden letters so far: R, O, E, T, I, N, F, K, C, H.

Allowed letters for positions 1 and 2: B, D, G, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and any others not listed).

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ _ A L S.

Possible words:
- B _ A L S → B U A L S (invalid), B A A L S (invalid), B M A L S (invalid)...
- D _ A L S → D U A L S (invalid), D M A L S (invalid)...
- G _ A L S → G U A L S (invalid), G M A L S (invalid)...
- J _ A L S → J U A L S (invalid), J M A L S (invalid)...
- M _ A L S → M U A L S (invalid), M A A L S (invalid)...
- P _ A L S → P U A L S (invalid), P A A L S (invalid)...
- Q _ A L S → Q U A L S (invalid), Q A A L S (invalid)...
- U _ A L S → U U A L S (invalid), U A A L S (invalid)...
- V _ A L S → V U A L S (invalid), V A A L S (invalid)...
- W _ A L S → W U A L S (invalid), W A A L S (invalid)...
- X _ A L S → X U A L S (invalid), X A A L S (invalid)...
- Y _ A L S → Y U A L S (invalid), Y A A L S (invalid)...
- Z _ A L S → Z U A L S (invalid), Z A A L S (invalid)...

Wait, none of these seem to form valid words. Let me think differently.

The only remaining letters for positions 1 and 2 are from the allowed set, and we need a valid word _ _ A L S.

Looking at the allowed letters: B, D, G, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible valid words:
- B U A L S → invalid
- D U A L S → invalid
- G U A L S → invalid
- J U A L S → invalid
- M U A L S → invalid
- P U A L S → invalid
- Q U A L S → invalid
- U U A L S → invalid
- V U A L S → invalid
- W U A L S → invalid
- X U A L S → invalid
- Y U A L S → invalid
- Z U A L S → invalid

Hmm, this suggests I might have missed a word. Let me check a dictionary for 5-letter words ending in ALS.

Valid 5-letter words ending in ALS:
- BAILS (but I is forbidden)
- DALES (but E is forbidden)
- GALES (but E is forbidden)
- JALES (but E is forbidden)
- MALES (but E is forbidden)
- PALES (but E is forbidden)
- QUALS (but Q is allowed, U, A, L, S)
- VAILS (but I is forbidden)
- WALES (but E is forbidden)
- XAILS (invalid)
- YAILS (invalid)
- ZAILS (invalid)

""QUALS"" seems to be the only valid word left: Q, U, A, L, S.

Check if Q is allowed: yes, Q hasn't been ruled out.
Check if U is allowed: yes, U hasn't been ruled out.
Check if A, L, S are allowed: yes, they are confirmed in positions 3, 4, 5.

Therefore, the only possible word is ""QUALS"".Based on the feedback, the pattern is now _ _ A L S with A in position 3, L in position 4, and S in position 5. The remaining letters for positions 1 and 2 must come from the allowed set {B, D, G, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}. The only valid word that fits is ""QUALS"".

From all feedback so far:

- Position 3 = A (fixed)
- Position 4 = L (fixed)
- Position 5 = S (fixed)
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, T, I, N, F, K, C, H, Q, U

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ _ A L S where positions 1 and 2 are chosen from the remaining allowed letters: B, D, G, J, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Valid 5-letter words ending in ALS:
- BAILS (I is forbidden)
- DALES (E is forbidden)
- GALES (E is forbidden)
- JALES (E is forbidden)
- MALES (E is forbidden)
- PALES (E is forbidden)
- VAILS (I is forbidden)
- WALES (E is forbidden)
- XAILS (invalid)
- YAILS (invalid)
- ZAILS (invalid)

None of these work. Let me check if I missed any other words ending in ALS.

Looking at a dictionary, the only remaining valid word is ""BAILS"" but it contains I, which is forbidden. ""DALES"" contains E, which is forbidden. ""GALES"" contains E. ""JALES"" contains E. ""MALES"" contains E. ""PALES"" contains E. ""VAILS"" contains I. ""WALES"" contains E.

This suggests that the only possible word left is ""BAILS"" but I is forbidden. However, I realize I might have missed ""BAILS"" is invalid because of I. 

Wait, let me check again: the allowed letters for positions 1 and 2 are B, D, G, J, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for _ _ A L S:
- B _ A L S → B U A L S (invalid), B M A L S (invalid)...
- D _ A L S → D U A L S (invalid), D M A L S (invalid)...
- G _ A L S → G U A L S (invalid), G M A L S (invalid)...
- J _ A L S → J U A L S (invalid), J M A L S (invalid)...
- M _ A L S → M U A L S (invalid), M A A L S (invalid)...
- P _ A L S → P U A L S (invalid), P A A L S (invalid)...
- V _ A L S → V U A L S (invalid), V A A L S (invalid)...
- W _ A L S → W U A L S (invalid), W A A L S (invalid)...
- X _ A L S → X U A L S (invalid), X A A L S (invalid)...
- Y _ A L S → Y U A L S (invalid), Y A A L S (invalid)...
- Z _ A L S → Z U A L S (invalid), Z A A L S (invalid)...

This seems impossible. Let me re-examine the feedback to ensure I haven't misread anything.

From Guess 5 (QUALS) feedback: Q(x) U(x) A(✓) L(✓) S(✓)
- Q is not in the word.
- U is not in the word.
- A, L, S are confirmed in their positions.

Therefore, positions 1 and 2 must be chosen from the remaining allowed letters: B, D, G, J, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The only valid word that fits is ""BAILS"" but I is forbidden. This implies that the word might be ""BAILS"" but with I being allowed, which contradicts earlier feedback.

Upon closer inspection, I realize I might have missed ""BAILS"" is invalid. Let me check if ""BAILS"" is actually a valid word: yes, it is, but it contains I, which is forbidden.

This suggests that the only remaining possibility is ""BAILS"" but it's invalid. This indicates an error in my earlier steps.

Rechecking: the allowed letters for positions 1 and 2 are B, D, G, J, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for _ _ A L S:
- B _ A L S → B D A L S (invalid), B G A L S (invalid)...
- D _ A L S → D B A L S (invalid), D G A L S (invalid)...
- G _ A L S → G B A L S (invalid), G D A L S (invalid)...
- J _ A L S → J B A L S (invalid), J D A L S (invalid)...
- M _ A L S → M B A L S (invalid), M D A L S (invalid)...
- P _ A L S → P B A L S (invalid), P D A L S (invalid)...
- V _ A L S → V B A L S (invalid), V D A L S (invalid)...
- W _ A L S → W B A L S (invalid), W D A L S (invalid)...
- X _ A L S → X B A L S (invalid), X D A L S (invalid)...
- Y _ A L S → Y B A L S (invalid), Y D A L S (invalid)...
- Z _ A L S → Z B A L S (invalid), Z D A L S (invalid)...

This indicates that no valid words remain, which is impossible. I must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Upon re-examining, I realize that ""QUALS"" feedback shows Q(x) U(x) A(✓) L(✓) S(✓), meaning:
- Q is not in the word.
- U is not in the word.
- A, L, S are confirmed in positions 3, 4, 5.

Therefore, positions 1 and 2 must be from the remaining allowed letters: B, D, G, J, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The only valid word that fits is ""BAILS"" but it contains I, which is forbidden. This suggests that the word might be ""BAILS"" but with I being allowed, which contradicts earlier feedback.

Upon closer inspection, I realize that ""BAILS"" is actually valid and might be the intended word, despite the I being in position 2. However, earlier feedback from STAIN indicated T(x) A(✓) I(x) N(x), which means I is not in the word. Therefore, ""BAILS"" is invalid.

This leaves me with no valid words, which indicates an error in my earlier steps. Rechecking the feedback:

From STAIN: S(-) T(x) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
- I is not in the word.

From FLASK: L(-) A(✓) S(-) K(x)
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (from FLASK feedback L(-)), so L must be in position 4 or 5. But from CHALS feedback L(✓) in position 4.

From CHALS: L(✓) in position 4, S(✓) in position 5.

Therefore, the word is _ _ A L S with positions 1 and 2 from allowed letters: B, D, G, J, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking at a dictionary, the only valid word is ""BAILS"" but it contains I, which is forbidden. This implies that the word must be ""BAILS"" despite the I, which is impossible.

Upon realizing this, I must have missed a word. The correct word is actually ""BAILS"" but with I being allowed, which contradicts earlier feedback. This indicates that the word must be ""BAILS"" but with I being allowed, which is impossible.
