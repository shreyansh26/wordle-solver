### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters and can help us eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. 

Common starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter overall

This should give us good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:

So we now know:
- The word contains at least one E, but not in position 5.
- The word does NOT contain S, L, A, or T.

Good next letters to test: common consonants like R, N, C, D, M, P, etc., and the remaining vowels O, I, U.

A strong second guess should:
1. Include E in a new position (positions 1-4).
2. Introduce new common letters not yet tested.
3. Avoid S, L, A, T.

Possible candidates:
- CRONE (C, R, O, N, E) – tests C, R, O, N, E.
- PRONE (P, R, O, N, E) – tests P, R, O, N, E.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters and can help us eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. 

Common starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: very common starting letter
- L: common consonant
- A: most common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common letter overall

This should give us good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word.
- L(x) – L is NOT in the word.
- A(x) – A is NOT in the word.
- T(x) – T is NOT in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (not last).

So we now know:
- The word contains at least one E, but not in position 5.
- The word does NOT contain S, L, A, or T.

Good next letters to test: common consonants like R, N, C, D, M, P, etc., and the remaining vowels O, I, U.

A strong second guess should:
1. Include E in a new position (positions 1-4).
2. Introduce new common letters not yet tested.
3. Avoid S, L, A, T.

Possible candidates:
- CRONE (C, R, O, N, E) – tests C, R, O, N, E.
- PRONE (P, R, O, N, E) – tests P, R, O, N, E.
- DRIPE (D, R, I, P, E) – tests D, R, I, P, E.

I’ll choose CRONE because C and N are very common, and it tests O and R which are also common.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, C, R

So the secret word must contain the letters E, O, N in some order, and none of the letters S, L, A, T, C, R can appear anywhere.

Good next letters to test (not yet ruled out) include common consonants like D, M, P, B, G, H, K, F, Y, etc., and the remaining vowels I, U.

A strong third guess should:
1. Place E, O, N in new positions to narrow their correct spots.
2. Introduce new high-frequency letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Candidate words:
- MONEY – uses M, O, N, E, Y → tests M and Y.
- DONNE – uses D, O, N, N, E → tests D.
- PONEY – uses P, O, N, E, Y → tests P and Y.

- Y(✓) – Y is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the word looks like: _ O N E Y

Only the first letter is unknown. From earlier feedback, we know the letters not in the word are: S, L, A, T, C, R, M.

Possible first letters (common consonants not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, etc.

Common 5-letter words ending in ONEY:
- BONEY
- DONEY (not a word)
- FONEY (not a word)
- GONEY (not a word)
- HONEY
- KONEY (not a word)
- PONEY (not a word)
- VONEY (not a word)
- WONEY (not a word)

The only valid English word is BONEY or HONEY. Between these, BONEY is more likely (B is a common starting letter).

Thus, the next guess should be BONEY.

From the feedback so far:

- Known pattern: _ O N E Y  
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, R, M, B  
- Still need a first letter that is NOT any of those and forms a valid 5-letter word ending in ON E Y.

Remaining common consonants that haven’t been ruled out: D, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, etc.

Scanning the dictionary for _ O N E Y:

- DONEY – invalid  
- FONEY – invalid  
- GONEY – invalid  
- HONEY – valid  
- KONEY – invalid  
- PONEY – invalid  
- VONEY – invalid  
- WONEY – invalid  

Only HONEY remains as a valid English word.

Therefore, the secret word must be HONEY.
