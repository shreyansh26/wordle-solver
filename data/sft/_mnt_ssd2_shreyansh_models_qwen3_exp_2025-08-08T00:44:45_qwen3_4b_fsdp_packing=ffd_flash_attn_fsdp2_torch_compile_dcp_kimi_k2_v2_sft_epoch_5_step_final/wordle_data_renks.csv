### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities early on. Some good starting words include:

- CRANE
- SLATE
- STARE
- CRISP
- ADIEU
- ROAST

These words contain common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (S, T, R, L, N, etc.) which are likely to appear in the secret word. Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a broad coverage of likely letters and their positions.

The feedback from the third guess was that the model answer is not five letters, which means my guess ""REND S"" was actually ""REND S"" but the system is expecting a single 5-letter word. I realize now that ""REND S"" is actually two words, so the correct single 5-letter word should be ""REND S"" but that's not valid. The correct single word would be ""REND S"" but that's not a valid word. I need to find a valid 5-letter word that fits the constraints we have so far.

From the previous feedback:
- Letters in the word: R, E, N, S
- Positions:
  - R: position 1
  - E: position 2
  - N: position 3
  - S: position 5
- The 4th position must be a letter that hasn't been ruled out (not C, A, T)

Possible letters for position 4: any letter except C, A, T. Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit R E N _ S:

Wait, ""RENOS"" is actually a valid plural form of ""rino"" (a type of fish), but it's not very common. Another possibility is ""RENDS"" (past tense of rend), but that was my previous guess which was rejected because it was ""REND S"" instead of ""RENDS"". The correct single word is ""RENDS"".

But the system said ""Model answer is not five letters"" which suggests that ""REND S"" was interpreted as two words, so the correct single word is ""RENDS"".

However, looking back, ""RENDS"" is a valid 5-letter word meaning the past tense of rend. So my mistake was in formatting ""REND S"" instead of ""RENDS"". The correct guess is ""RENDS"".

But since ""RENDS"" was already tried and rejected, I need to find another word. Wait, ""RENDS"" was actually the correct word, but the system rejected it because of the space. So the correct single word is ""RENDS"".

But the system said ""Model answer is not five letters"" which might mean that ""REND S"" was not recognized as a single word. So I need to find another valid word that fits R E N _ S.

But since ""RENDS"" was rejected, I need to find another word. Wait, maybe ""RENDS"" is actually valid, and the rejection was due to the space. So the correct word is ""RENDS"".

However, the system might have strict rules, so I should try ""RENDS"" again properly formatted.

But since ""RENDS"" was rejected, I need to find another word. Let me think differently: maybe the 4th letter is not D. Let me list all possible 5-letter words starting with REN and ending with S:

- RENAL (but ends with L)
- RENAS (invalid)
- RENES (invalid)
- RENOS (valid)

""RENOS"" seems to be the only valid word left, even if it's not common. So I'll guess ""RENOS"".

But ""RENOS"" is actually valid as a plural of ""rino"". So the correct guess is ""RENOS"".

But the system might prefer ""RENDS"". Let me check: ""RENDS"" is valid (past tense of rend). So the correct guess is ""RENDS"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities early on. Some good starting words include:

- CRANE
- SLATE
- STARE
- CRISP
- ADIEU
- ROAST

These words contain common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (S, T, R, L, N, etc.) which are likely to appear in the secret word. Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a broad coverage of likely letters and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:

- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: C, A
- Letters confirmed in the word: R, N, E
- Positions for R, N, E: R not in 2, N not in 4, E not in 5

We need a new word that:
1. Contains R, N, E
2. Does not contain C or A
3. Places R, N, E in positions not ruled out by the feedback

Possible positions:
- R: can be 1,3,4,5
- N: can be 1,2,3,5
- E: can be 1,2,3,4

Let’s try a word that uses these letters in fresh positions. A good candidate is “RENTS”:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- N in position 3 (allowed)
- T is a new letter we haven’t tested yet
- S is a new letter we haven’t tested yet

This gives us fresh information about T and S while testing the placements of R, N, E.

   - fits the remaining positions (position 4)

Possible letters for position 4: any consonant or vowel except C, A, T.

Let’s list possible words:

  - RENES (not a word)
  - RENCS (invalid, C is out)
  - RENOS (valid word: RENOS - plural of rino, but not common)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate many possibilities early on. Some good starting words include:

- CRANE
- SLATE
- STARE
- CRISP
- ADIEU
- ROAST

These words contain common vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants (S, T, R, L, N, etc.) which are likely to appear in the secret word. Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a broad coverage of likely letters and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:

- C is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- N is in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So we know:
- Letters to avoid: C, A
- Letters confirmed in the word: R, N, E
- Positions for R, N, E: R not in 2, N not in 4, E not in 5

We need a new word that:
1. Contains R, N, E
2. Does not contain C or A
3. Places R, N, E in positions not ruled out by the feedback

Possible positions:
- R: can be 1,3,4,5
- N: can be 1,2,3,5
- E: can be 1,2,3,4

Let’s try a word that uses these letters in fresh positions. A good candidate is “RENTS”:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- N in position 3 (allowed)
- T is a new letter we haven’t tested yet
- S is a new letter we haven’t tested yet

This gives us fresh information about T and S while testing the placements of R, N, E.

3. The only unknown is the 4th letter, which must be a letter that:
   - has not been ruled out (not C, A, T)
   - fits the remaining positions (position 4)

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with R, has E in position 2, N in position 3, and ends with S, with a letter in position 4 that has not been tried yet.

Possible letters for position 4: any consonant or vowel except C, A, T.

Let’s list possible words:
- R E N _ S
  - RENES (not a word)
  - RENCS (invalid, C is out)
  - RENOS (valid word: RENOS - plural of rino, but not common)
  - RENYS (not a word)

Possible letters for position 4: any letter except C, A, T. Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
