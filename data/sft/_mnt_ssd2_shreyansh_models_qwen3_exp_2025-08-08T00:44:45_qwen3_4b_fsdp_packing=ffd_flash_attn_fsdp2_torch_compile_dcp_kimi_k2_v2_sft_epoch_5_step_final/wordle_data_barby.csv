For the first guess, we want to choose a word that will give us the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate or confirm many letters at once.

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A word that uses several of these common letters is ""AROSE"". This word contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

Other good options could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a particularly strong first guess because it covers five distinct common letters. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.
- Contains A and R somewhere, but A is not first and R is not second.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R (but A not in 1st, R not in 2nd).
2. Does not use O, S, or E.
3. Uses 5 distinct letters (to maximize information).

Good remaining consonants and vowels: T, N, L, I, U, C, D, etc.

Possible candidates:
- TRAIL (but has L and I, and A is 3rd, R is 2nd - R is 2nd is bad)
- CRANK (A is 3rd, R is 2nd - R is 2nd is bad)
- DRANK (A is 3rd, R is 2nd - R is 2nd is bad)
- TRAIN (A is 2nd, R is 3rd - A is 2nd is allowed, R is 3rd is allowed)
- CRATE (E is excluded)
- TRAMP (A is 2nd, R is 1st - A is 2nd allowed, R is 1st allowed)
- TRASH (S is excluded)
- TRUNK (A is not present - bad)
- TRAMP seems good: T, R, A, M, P. No O, S, E. A is 2nd, R is 1st.

But let's check if we can do better. Maybe a word with more common letters.
- TRAIL (A is 3rd, R is 2nd - R is 2nd is bad)
- CRATE (E is excluded)
- BRISK (S is excluded)
- PRANK (A is 2nd, R is 1st - good)
- PRANK: P, R, A, N, K. No O, S, E. A is 2nd, R is 1st. This seems better than TRAMP because P and N/K are common.

Another option:
- CRANE (E is excluded)
- PRANK seems the best so far.

But let's think of another word: DRANK (A is 2nd, R is 1st, D, N, K - all allowed). DRANK has D, R, A, N, K.

Between PRANK and DRANK, both are good. PRANK uses P, which is common, while DRANK uses D. Both are fine.

Another candidate: TRAMP (T, R, A, M, P) - A is 2nd, R is 1st, no O/S/E. This seems very good.

But let's pick one. TRAMP has T, R, A, M, P. All letters allowed. A is 2nd, R is 1st - both positions are allowed.

So I'll go with TRAMP.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
   - O, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. TRAMP → T(x) R(-) A(-) M(x) P(x)
   - T, M, P are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (already knew that).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (already knew that).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, M, P
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, R
- Positions we have ruled out:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 3
  – R cannot be in positions 2 or 3
  – A cannot be in position 4 (because in TRAMP, A was in position 3, but that was already known; actually the feedback only shows A(-) meaning it’s in the word but not in position 3, so position 4 is still open for A)
  – R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE) and position 3 (from TRAMP), so R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and R
- Does NOT contain O, S, E, T, M, P
- A is not in positions 1 or 3
- R is not in positions 2 or 3

Remaining common letters to try: D, N, L, C, U, I, Y, B, G, H, K, etc.

Possible candidates:
- R A _ _ _ (but A cannot be in position 2, so R A _ _ _ is invalid)
- _ _ A _ _ (A in position 3 is invalid, so A must be in 2, 4, or 5)
- _ _ _ A _ (A in position 4 is allowed)
- _ _ _ _ A (A in position 5 is allowed)

Let’s try to find a word with A in position 2 or 4 or 5 and R in position 1, 4, or 5.

For example:
- R A _ _ _ → invalid (A in position 2 is allowed, but we need to check other constraints)
- _ A _ _ R → A in position 2, R in position 5
- _ _ A _ R → A in position 3 (invalid)
- _ _ _ A R → A in position 4, R in position 5
- _ _ R _ A → R in position 3 (invalid)
- _ R _ _ A → R in position 2 (invalid)
- R _ A _ _ → R in position 1, A in position 3 (invalid)
- R _ _ A _ → R in position 1, A in position 4
- R _ _ _ A → R in position 1, A in position 5

Let’s pick R _ _ A _ (R in 1, A in 4) and fill the middle letters with remaining allowed letters.

Possible letters left: D, N, L, C, U, I, Y, B, G, H, K, F, W, etc.

Looking for words:
- R U N A _ → RUNAS (invalid)
- R I N G A → RINGA (invalid)
- R I N K A → RINKA (invalid)
- R I N D A → RINDA (invalid)
- R U N D A → RUNDA (invalid)
- R I N G A → RINGA (invalid)
- R U N G A → RUNGA (invalid)
- R I N K A → RINKA (invalid)
- R I N D A → RINDA (invalid)
- R U N D A → RUNDA (invalid)
- R I N G A → RINGA (invalid)
- R U N G A → RUNGA (invalid)
- R I N K A → RINKA (invalid)

Hmm, let me think differently. Maybe A in position 2 and R in position 4 or 5.

For example:
- _ A _ R _ → A in 2, R in 4

<guess>LUNAR</guess>",LUNAR,"From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
   - O, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. TRAMP → T(x) R(-) A(-) M(x) P(x)
   - T, M, P are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (already knew that).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (already knew that).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, M, P
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, R
- Positions we have ruled out:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 3
  – R cannot be in positions 2 or 3
  – A cannot be in position 4 (because in TRAMP, A was in position 3, but that was already known; actually the feedback only shows A(-) meaning it’s in the word but not in position 3, so position 4 is still open for A)
  – R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE) and position 3 (from TRAMP), so R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and R
- Does NOT contain O, S, E, T, M, P
- A is not in positions 1 or 3
- R is not in positions 2 or 3

Remaining common letters to try: D, N, L, C, U, I, Y, B, G, H, K, etc.

Possible candidates:

- _ _ _ A _ (A in position 4 is allowed)
- _ _ _ _ A (A in position 5 is allowed)

Let’s try to find a word with A in position 2 or 4 or 5 and R in position 1, 4, or 5.

For example:
- R A _ _ _ → invalid (A in position 2 is allowed, but we need to check other constraints)
- _ A _ _ R → A in position 2, R in position 5
- _ _ A _ R → A in position 3 (invalid)

- R _ A _ _ → R in position 1, A in position 3 (invalid)
- R _ _ A _ → R in position 1, A in position 4

Let’s pick R _ _ A _ (R in 1, A in 4) and fill the middle letters with remaining allowed letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that will give us the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate or confirm many letters at once.

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A word that uses several of these common letters is ""AROSE"". This word contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

Other good options could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a particularly strong first guess because it covers five distinct common letters. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.
- Contains A and R somewhere, but A is not first and R is not second.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R (but A not in 1st, R not in 2nd).
2. Does not use O, S, or E.
3. Uses 5 distinct letters (to maximize information).

Good remaining consonants and vowels: T, N, L, I, U, C, D, etc.

Possible candidates:
- TRAIL (but has L and I, and A is 3rd, R is 2nd - R is 2nd is bad)
- CRANK (A is 3rd, R is 2nd - R is 2nd is bad)
- DRANK (A is 3rd, R is 2nd - R is 2nd is bad)
- TRAIN (A is 2nd, R is 3rd - A is 2nd is allowed, R is 3rd is allowed)
- CRATE (E is excluded)
- TRAMP (A is 2nd, R is 1st - A is 2nd allowed, R is 1st allowed)
- TRASH (S is excluded)
- TRUNK (A is not present - bad)
- TRAMP seems good: T, R, A, M, P. No O, S, E. A is 2nd, R is 1st.

But let's check if we can do better. Maybe a word with more common letters.
- TRAIL (A is 3rd, R is 2nd - R is 2nd is bad)
- CRATE (E is excluded)
- BRISK (S is excluded)
- PRANK (A is 2nd, R is 1st - good)
- PRANK: P, R, A, N, K. No O, S, E. A is 2nd, R is 1st. This seems better than TRAMP because P and N/K are common.

Another option:
- CRANE (E is excluded)
- PRANK seems the best so far.

But let's think of another word: DRANK (A is 2nd, R is 1st, D, N, K - all allowed). DRANK has D, R, A, N, K.

Between PRANK and DRANK, both are good. PRANK uses P, which is common, while DRANK uses D. Both are fine.

Another candidate: TRAMP (T, R, A, M, P) - A is 2nd, R is 1st, no O/S/E. This seems very good.

But let's pick one. TRAMP has T, R, A, M, P. All letters allowed. A is 2nd, R is 1st - both positions are allowed.

So I'll go with TRAMP.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
   - O, S, E are not in the word at all.

   - T, M, P are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (already knew that).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (already knew that).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, M, P

  – R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE) and position 3 (from TRAMP), so R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and R
- Does NOT contain O, S, E, T, M, P
- A is not in positions 1 or 3
- R is not in positions 2 or 3

Remaining common letters to try: D, N, L, C, U, I, Y, B, G, H, K, etc.

Possible candidates:

- _ _ _ _ A (A in position 5 is allowed)

- _ A _ _ R → A in position 2, R in position 5
- _ _ A _ R → A in position 3 (invalid)

- R _ A _ _ → R in position 1, A in position 3 (invalid)
- R _ _ A _ → R in position 1, A in position 4
- R _ _ _ A → R in position 1, A in position 5

Let’s pick R _ _ A _ (R in 1, A in 4) and fill the middle letters with remaining allowed letters.

Let's consolidate everything we know so far.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x feedback):
O, S, E, T, M, P, L, U, N

Letters that ARE in the word (from the (-) feedback):
A, R

Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4
- R cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5

Therefore:
- A must be in position 2
- R must be in position 1 or 4

Remaining letters that have not been tried yet and are not excluded:
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we'll focus on common ones)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2
- Has R in position 1 or 4
- Uses only allowed letters
- Is a valid English word

Possible patterns:
1. R A _ _ _ (R in 1, A in 2)
2. _ A _ R _ (A in 2, R in 4)

Let's explore both patterns.

Pattern 1: R A _ _ _
We need three more letters after RA, none of which are in the excluded list.
Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, etc.
Possible words:
- R A B B Y → invalid (double B, Y is allowed)
- R A C E Y → E is excluded
- R A I N Y → N is excluded
- R A D I O → O is excluded
- R A I N S → S is excluded
- R A I N B → ""RAINB"" is not a word
- R A I N D → ""RAIND"" is not a word
- R A I N G → ""RAIN"" + G → ""RAIN"" is 4 letters, ""RAIN"" + G = ""RAIN"" but needs 5 letters
- R A I N K → ""RAINK"" is not a word
- R A I N Y → ""RAINY"" is a word but Y is allowed
  - Check letters: R, A, I, N, Y
  - N is excluded → invalid
- R A B I D → ""RABID"" is a word
  - Letters: R, A, B, I, D
  - All letters allowed (R, A, B, I, D)
  - R is in position 1 (allowed)
  - A is in position 2 (allowed)
  - No excluded letters
  - Valid English word

Pattern 2: _ A _ R _
We need letters before A and after R, none excluded.
Possible words:
- B A R R Y → double R
- C A R R Y → double R
- D A R R Y → double R
- F A R R Y → double R
- G A R R Y → double R
- H A R R Y → double R
- V A R R Y → double R
- W A R R Y → double R
- X A R R Y → double R
- Y A R R Y → double R
- Z A R R Y → double R
- All have double R → invalid
- B A R K Y → Y is allowed, but K is allowed
  - Letters: B, A, R, K, Y
  - R is in position 3 → invalid (R cannot be in 3)
- D A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- F A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- G A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- H A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- V A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- W A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- X A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- Y A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- Z A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- All have R in 3 → invalid

So Pattern 2 seems impossible because R would have to be in position 4, but we already have R in position 1 or 4, and position 4 is possible only if A is in 2 and R in 4, but we need to check if any word fits that.

Pattern 3: _ A _ _ R
A is in 2, R in 5
But R cannot be in 5 (from feedback: R(-) in LUNAR means R is not in position 5)
So this is invalid

Thus, only Pattern 1 seems viable.

R A B I D is a valid word that fits all constraints.

Let's verify:
- R A B I D
  - Letters: R, A, B, I, D
  - R in position 1 (allowed)
  - A in position 2 (allowed)
  - B, I, D are not excluded
  - No excluded letters (O, S, E, T, M, P, L, U, N are all absent)
  - Valid English word

Therefore, RABID is the next logical guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that will give us the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate or confirm many letters at once.

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A word that uses several of these common letters is ""AROSE"". This word contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

Other good options could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a particularly strong first guess because it covers five distinct common letters. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.
- Contains A and R somewhere, but A is not first and R is not second.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R (but A not in 1st, R not in 2nd).
2. Does not use O, S, or E.
3. Uses 5 distinct letters (to maximize information).

Good remaining consonants and vowels: T, N, L, I, U, C, D, etc.

Possible candidates:
- TRAIL (but has L and I, and A is 3rd, R is 2nd - R is 2nd is bad)
- CRANK (A is 3rd, R is 2nd - R is 2nd is bad)
- DRANK (A is 3rd, R is 2nd - R is 2nd is bad)
- TRAIN (A is 2nd, R is 3rd - A is 2nd is allowed, R is 3rd is allowed)
- CRATE (E is excluded)
- TRAMP (A is 2nd, R is 1st - A is 2nd allowed, R is 1st allowed)
- TRASH (S is excluded)
- TRUNK (A is not present - bad)
- TRAMP seems good: T, R, A, M, P. No O, S, E. A is 2nd, R is 1st.

But let's check if we can do better. Maybe a word with more common letters.
- TRAIL (A is 3rd, R is 2nd - R is 2nd is bad)
- CRATE (E is excluded)
- BRISK (S is excluded)
- PRANK (A is 2nd, R is 1st - good)
- PRANK: P, R, A, N, K. No O, S, E. A is 2nd, R is 1st. This seems better than TRAMP because P and N/K are common.

Another option:
- CRANE (E is excluded)
- PRANK seems the best so far.

But let's think of another word: DRANK (A is 2nd, R is 1st, D, N, K - all allowed). DRANK has D, R, A, N, K.

Between PRANK and DRANK, both are good. PRANK uses P, which is common, while DRANK uses D. Both are fine.

Another candidate: TRAMP (T, R, A, M, P) - A is 2nd, R is 1st, no O/S/E. This seems very good.

But let's pick one. TRAMP has T, R, A, M, P. All letters allowed. A is 2nd, R is 1st - both positions are allowed.

So I'll go with TRAMP.

Guess 2: TRAMP -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) M(x) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
   - O, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. TRAMP → T(x) R(-) A(-) M(x) P(x)
   - T, M, P are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (already knew that).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (already knew that).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, M, P
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, R
- Positions we have ruled out:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 3
  – R cannot be in positions 2 or 3
  – A cannot be in position 4 (because in TRAMP, A was in position 3, but that was already known; actually the feedback only shows A(-) meaning it’s in the word but not in position 3, so position 4 is still open for A)
  – R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE) and position 3 (from TRAMP), so R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and R
- Does NOT contain O, S, E, T, M, P
- A is not in positions 1 or 3
- R is not in positions 2 or 3

Remaining common letters to try: D, N, L, C, U, I, Y, B, G, H, K, etc.

Possible candidates:
- R A _ _ _ (but A cannot be in position 2, so R A _ _ _ is invalid)
- _ _ A _ _ (A in position 3 is invalid, so A must be in 2, 4, or 5)
- _ _ _ A _ (A in position 4 is allowed)
- _ _ _ _ A (A in position 5 is allowed)

Let’s try to find a word with A in position 2 or 4 or 5 and R in position 1, 4, or 5.

For example:
- R A _ _ _ → invalid (A in position 2 is allowed, but we need to check other constraints)
- _ A _ _ R → A in position 2, R in position 5
- _ _ A _ R → A in position 3 (invalid)
- _ _ _ A R → A in position 4, R in position 5
- _ _ R _ A → R in position 3 (invalid)
- _ R _ _ A → R in position 2 (invalid)
- R _ A _ _ → R in position 1, A in position 3 (invalid)
- R _ _ A _ → R in position 1, A in position 4
- R _ _ _ A → R in position 1, A in position 5

Let’s pick R _ _ A _ (R in 1, A in 4) and fill the middle letters with remaining allowed letters.

Possible letters left: D, N, L, C, U, I, Y, B, G, H, K, F, W, etc.

Looking for words:
- R U N A _ → RUNAS (invalid)
- R I N G A → RINGA (invalid)
- R I N K A → RINKA (invalid)
- R I N D A → RINDA (invalid)
- R U N D A → RUNDA (invalid)
- R I N G A → RINGA (invalid)

- R U N D A → RUNDA (invalid)
- R I N G A → RINGA (invalid)
- R U N G A → RUNGA (invalid)
- R I N K A → RINKA (invalid)

Hmm, let me think differently. Maybe A in position 2 and R in position 4 or 5.

For example:
- _ A _ R _ → A in 2, R in 4
- _ A _ _ R → A in 2, R in 5

- B A R R _ → invalid (double R)

- R U N D A → RUNDA (invalid)
- R I N D A → RINDA (invalid)
- R U N G A → RUNGA (invalid)
- R I N G A → RINGA (invalid)
- R U N K A → RUNKA (invalid)
- R I N K A → RINKA (invalid)
- R U N D A → RUNDA (invalid)

- F U N A R → FUNAR (invalid)
- G U N A R → GUNAR (invalid)
- H U N A R → HUNAR (invalid)
- L U N A R → LUNAR (valid 5-letter word!)

1. R A _ _ _ (R in 1, A in 2)
2. _ A _ R _ (A in 2, R in 4)

Let's explore both patterns.

Pattern 1: R A _ _ _
We need three more letters after RA, none of which are in the excluded list.
Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, etc.
Possible words:
- R A B B Y → invalid (double B, Y is allowed)
- R A C E Y → E is excluded
- R A I N Y → N is excluded
- R A D I O → O is excluded
- R A I N S → S is excluded
- R A I N B → ""RAINB"" is not a word
- R A I N D → ""RAIND"" is not a word
- R A I N G → ""RAIN"" + G → ""RAIN"" is 4 letters, ""RAIN"" + G = ""RAIN"" but needs 5 letters
- R A I N K → ""RAINK"" is not a word
- R A I N Y → ""RAINY"" is a word but Y is allowed
  - Check letters: R, A, I, N, Y
  - N is excluded → invalid
- R A B I D → ""RABID"" is a word
  - Letters: R, A, B, I, D
  - All letters allowed (R, A, B, I, D)
  - R is in position 1 (allowed)
  - A is in position 2 (allowed)
  - No excluded letters
  - Valid English word

Pattern 2: _ A _ R _
We need letters before A and after R, none excluded.
Possible words:
- B A R R Y → double R
- C A R R Y → double R
- D A R R Y → double R
- F A R R Y → double R
- G A R R Y → double R
- H A R R Y → double R
- V A R R Y → double R
- W A R R Y → double R
- X A R R Y → double R
- Y A R R Y → double R
- Z A R R Y → double R
- All have double R → invalid
- B A R K Y → Y is allowed, but K is allowed
  - Letters: B, A, R, K, Y
  - R is in position 3 → invalid (R cannot be in 3)
- D A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- F A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- G A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- H A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- V A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- W A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- X A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- Y A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- Z A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- All have R in 3 → invalid

So Pattern 2 seems impossible because R would have to be in position 4, but we already have R in position 1 or 4, and position 4 is possible only if A is in 2 and R in 4, but we need to check if any word fits that.

Pattern 3: _ A _ _ R
A is in 2, R in 5
But R cannot be in 5 (from feedback: R(-) in LUNAR means R is not in position 5)
So this is invalid

Thus, only Pattern 1 seems viable.

R A B I D is a valid word that fits all constraints.

Let's verify:
- R A B I D
  - Letters: R, A, B, I, D
  - R in position 1 (allowed)
  - A in position 2 (allowed)
  - B, I, D are not excluded
  - No excluded letters (O, S, E, T, M, P, L, U, N are all absent)
  - Valid English word

Therefore, RABID is the next logical guess.

Let's update everything we now know after the fourth guess.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x feedback):
O, S, E, T, M, P, L, U, N, I, D

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or - feedback):
- A is in position 2 (✓ from RABID)
- R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (from AROSE, TRAMP, LUNAR, RABID)
  - Positions ruled out for R: 1, 2, 3, 5
  - Therefore R must be in position 4

So far:
- Position 2 = A
- Position 4 = R

Remaining letters to fill: positions 1, 3, 5
Allowed letters (not excluded): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
(But we want common letters; focus on B, C, F, G, H, K, W, Y)

We need a valid 5-letter English word with pattern:
_ A _ R _

Let's list possible words:
- B A C R Y → not a word
- B A G R Y → not a word
- B A H R Y → not a word
- C A B R Y → not a word
- C A F R Y → not a word

- Y A F R Y → not a word
- Y A G R Y → not a word
- Y A K R Y → not a word
- Y A V R Y → not a word
- Y A W R Y → not a word

Hmm, none of these seem to be valid words. Let's double-check the pattern and constraints.

Wait, the pattern is _ A _ R _ with:
- Position 2 = A
- Position 4 = R
- Positions 1, 3, 5 must be from allowed letters (B, C, F, G, H, K, W, Y)

Let me think of actual words:
- B A C K R → not a word
- B A C K Y → not a word
- B A C K S → S is excluded
- C A P R Y → P is excluded
- C A R R Y → R is already in position 4, so double R is invalid
- C A R S Y → S is excluded
- F A C T R → not a word
- F A C T S → S is excluded
- G A M E R → M is excluded
- G A M E Y → M is excluded
- H A N G R → N is excluded
- H A N G S → S is excluded
- K A R T Y → K, A, R, T, Y → T is excluded
- K A R T Y is invalid
- V A L U R → L is excluded
- V A L U E → E is excluded
- W A R D R → D is excluded
- W A R D Y → D is excluded
- Y A R D Y → D is excluded

Wait, let's list valid 5-letter words with pattern _ A _ R _ and check letters:

Valid English words:
- B A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- C A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- F A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- G A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- H A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- V A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- W A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- X A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- Y A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- Z A R R Y → double R (invalid)

None of these are valid because they have double R. But we have R in position 4, so position 3 must be something else.

Wait, the word must be _ A _ R _ with:
- Position 1: any allowed letter
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: any allowed letter
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: any allowed letter

Let me think differently. Maybe the word is B A R K Y → but K is allowed and Y is allowed, but R would be in position 3 which is invalid (R cannot be in position 3). Similarly, C A R K Y → R in 3 invalid.

Wait, let's list all valid 5-letter words with pattern _ A _ R _ and check letters:

Looking up valid words:
- B A R K Y → R in 3 invalid
- B A R R Y → double R invalid
- C A R K Y → R in 3 invalid
- C A R R Y → double R invalid
- F A R K Y → R in 3 invalid
- G A R K Y → R in 3 invalid
- H A R K Y → R in 3 invalid
- V A R K Y → R in 3 invalid
- W A R K Y → R in 3 invalid

None of these fit. Let me think of other words:

- B A H R Y → not a word
- B A K R Y → not a word
- B A V R Y → not a word

- Y A W R Y → not a word

This is perplexing. None of these seem to be valid words. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Wait, the word must be _ A _ R _ with:
- Position 2 = A
- Position 4 = R
- Positions 1, 3, 5 must be from allowed letters (B, C, F, G, H, K, W, Y)

Let me think of actual words:
- B A K R Y → not a word
- B A F R Y → not a word
- C A K R Y → not a word
- C A F R Y → not a word
- F A K R Y → not a word
- F A C R Y → not a word

- K A C R Y → not a word
- V A K R Y → not a word
- V A C R Y → not a word
- W A K R Y → not a word
- W A C R Y → not a word

This suggests there might be no valid words left, which is unlikely. Let me check if I missed any letters.

Allowed letters left: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let me think of words with pattern _ A _ R _ using these letters:
- B A C K R → not a word
- B A C K Y → not a word
- B A F R Y → not a word
- B A G R Y → not a word
- B A H R Y → not a word
- B A K R Y → not a word

- Z A K R Y → not a word
- Z A V R Y → not a word
- Z A W R Y → not a word

This is impossible. There must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Let me re-examine the constraints:

From the feedback:
- A is in position 2 (✓ from RABID)
- R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (from AROSE, TRAMP, LUNAR, RABID)
  - Therefore R must be in position 4
- So the word is _ A _ R _

But I can't find any valid 5-letter English word with this pattern. This suggests I might have missed a letter or misinterpreted the feedback.

Wait, let me re-check the feedback for RABID:
RABID → R(-) A(✓) B(-) I(x) D(x)

- R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 1
- A(✓) means A is in position 2
- B(-) means B is in the word but not in position 3
- I(x) means I is not in the word
- D(x) means D is not in the word

So:
- R is in the word but not in position 1
- A is in position 2
- B is in the word but not in position 3
- I and D are not in the word
- O, S, E, T, M, P, L, U, N are not in the word

Therefore:
- Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Position 2 = A
- R must be in position 3 or 4 or 5 (but from AROSE, R is not in position 2; from TRAMP, R is not in position 2; from LUNAR, R is not in position 5; from RABID, R is not in position 1)
  - So R must be in position 3 or 4

Let me re-express:

From all feedback:
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 5
- Therefore R must be in position 3 or 4
- A is in position 2
- B is in the word but not in position 3
- Letters not in the word: O, S, E, T, M, P, L, U, N, I, D

So possible patterns:
1. _ A R _ _
2. _ A _ R _

Let's explore both.

Pattern 1: _ A R _ _
- Position 3 = R
- Position 2 = A
- Need positions 1, 4, 5
- Allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- B is in the word but not in position 3 (which is R), so B can be in 1, 4, or 5
- Let's find valid words:
  - B A R _ _ → B A R K Y → K, Y allowed
    - B A R K Y → valid word
    - Check letters: B, A, R, K, Y
    - R is in position 3 (allowed)
    - B is in position 1 (allowed)
    - K, Y are allowed
    - No excluded letters
  - C A R _ _ → C A R K Y → valid word
    - C, A, R, K, Y
    - R in 3
    - C, Y allowed
  - F A R _ _ → F A R K Y → valid word
    - F, A, R, K, Y
    - R in 3
    - F, Y allowed

Pattern 2: _ A _ R _
- Position 4 = R
- Need positions 1, 3, 5
- B must be in 1, 3, or 5 (but not 3)
  - So B in 1 or 5
- Let's find valid words:
  - B A _ R _
    - B A C R Y → not a word
    - B A F R Y → not a word
    - B A G R Y → not a word
    - B A H R Y → not a word
    - B A K R Y → not a word
    - B A V R Y → not a word
    - B A W R Y → not a word
  - _ A B R _ → but A is in 2, so this would be _ A B R _
    - C A B R Y → not a word
    - F A B R Y → not a word
    - G A B R Y → not a word
    - H A B R Y → not a word
    - V A B R Y → not a word
    - W A B R Y → not a word
  - _ A _ R B
    - C A K R B → not a word
    - F A K R B → not a word
    - G A K R B → not a word
    - H A K R B → not a word
    - V A K R B → not a word
    - W A K R B → not a word
  - _ A _ R Y
    - C A K R Y → not a word
    - F A K R Y → not a word
    - G A K R Y → not a word
    - H A K R Y → not a word
    - V A K R Y → not a word
    - W A K R Y → not a word

Thus, Pattern 1 seems to have valid words: BARKY, CARKY, FARKY, etc.

Let me choose BARKY.

Check BARKY:
- B A R K Y
- Letters: B, A, R, K, Y
- R is in position 3 (allowed)
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- B is in position 1 (allowed)
- K, Y are allowed
- No excluded letters
- Valid English word

Therefore, BARKY is the next guess.
</think>

<guess>BARKY</guess>",BARKY,"Let's update everything we now know after the fourth guess.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x feedback):
O, S, E, T, M, P, L, U, N, I, D

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or - feedback):
- A is in position 2 (✓ from RABID)
- R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (from AROSE, TRAMP, LUNAR, RABID)
  - Positions ruled out for R: 1, 2, 3, 5
  - Therefore R must be in position 4

So far:
- Position 2 = A
- Position 4 = R

Remaining letters to fill: positions 1, 3, 5
Allowed letters (not excluded): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
(But we want common letters; focus on B, C, F, G, H, K, W, Y)

We need a valid 5-letter English word with pattern:
_ A _ R _

Let's list possible words:
- B A C R Y → not a word
- B A G R Y → not a word
- B A H R Y → not a word
- C A B R Y → not a word
- C A F R Y → not a word
- C A G R Y → not a word
- C A H R Y → not a word
- C A K R Y → not a word
- C A V R Y → not a word
- C A W R Y → not a word
- F A C R Y → not a word
- F A G R Y → not a word
- F A K R Y → not a word
- G A B R Y → not a word
- G A F R Y → not a word
- G A H R Y → not a word
- G A K R Y → not a word
- H A C R Y → not a word
- H A K R Y → not a word
- K A C R Y → not a word
- K A F R Y → not a word
- K A G R Y → not a word
- K A H R Y → not a word
- K A V R Y → not a word
- K A W R Y → not a word
- V A C R Y → not a word
- V A F R Y → not a word
- V A G R Y → not a word
- V A K R Y → not a word
- V A W R Y → not a word
- W A C R Y → not a word
- W A F R Y → not a word
- W A G R Y → not a word
- W A K R Y → not a word
- W A V R Y → not a word
- W A Y R Y → not a word
- Y A C R Y → not a word
- Y A F R Y → not a word
- Y A G R Y → not a word
- Y A K R Y → not a word
- Y A V R Y → not a word
- Y A W R Y → not a word

Hmm, none of these seem to be valid words. Let's double-check the pattern and constraints.

Wait, the pattern is _ A _ R _ with:
- Position 2 = A
- Position 4 = R
- Positions 1, 3, 5 must be from allowed letters (B, C, F, G, H, K, W, Y)

Let me think of actual words:
- B A C K R → not a word
- B A C K Y → not a word
- B A C K S → S is excluded
- C A P R Y → P is excluded
- C A R R Y → R is already in position 4, so double R is invalid
- C A R S Y → S is excluded
- F A C T R → not a word
- F A C T S → S is excluded
- G A M E R → M is excluded
- G A M E Y → M is excluded
- H A N G R → N is excluded
- H A N G S → S is excluded
- K A R T Y → K, A, R, T, Y → T is excluded
- K A R T Y is invalid
- V A L U R → L is excluded
- V A L U E → E is excluded
- W A R D R → D is excluded
- W A R D Y → D is excluded
- Y A R D Y → D is excluded

Wait, let's list valid 5-letter words with pattern _ A _ R _ and check letters:

Valid English words:
- B A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- C A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- F A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- G A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- H A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- V A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- W A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- X A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- Y A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- Z A R R Y → double R (invalid)

None of these are valid because they have double R. But we have R in position 4, so position 3 must be something else.

Wait, the word must be _ A _ R _ with:
- Position 1: any allowed letter
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: any allowed letter
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: any allowed letter

Let me think differently. Maybe the word is B A R K Y → but K is allowed and Y is allowed, but R would be in position 3 which is invalid (R cannot be in position 3). Similarly, C A R K Y → R in 3 invalid.

Wait, let's list all valid 5-letter words with pattern _ A _ R _ and check letters:

Looking up valid words:
- B A R K Y → R in 3 invalid
- B A R R Y → double R invalid
- C A R K Y → R in 3 invalid
- C A R R Y → double R invalid
- F A R K Y → R in 3 invalid
- G A R K Y → R in 3 invalid
- H A R K Y → R in 3 invalid
- V A R K Y → R in 3 invalid
- W A R K Y → R in 3 invalid

None of these fit. Let me think of other words:

- B A G R Y → not a word
- B A F R Y → not a word
- B A H R Y → not a word
- B A K R Y → not a word
- B A V R Y → not a word

- Y A G R Y → not a word

This is impossible. There must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Let me re-examine the constraints:

From the feedback:
- A is in position 2 (✓ from RABID)
- R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (from AROSE, TRAMP, LUNAR, RABID)
  - Therefore R must be in position 4
- So the word is _ A _ R _

But I can't find any valid 5-letter English word with this pattern. This suggests I might have missed a letter or misinterpreted the feedback.

Wait, let me re-check the feedback for RABID:
RABID → R(-) A(✓) B(-) I(x) D(x)

- R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 1
- A(✓) means A is in position 2
- B(-) means B is in the word but not in position 3
- I(x) means I is not in the word
- D(x) means D is not in the word

So:
- R is in the word but not in position 1
- A is in position 2
- B is in the word but not in position 3
- I and D are not in the word
- O, S, E, T, M, P, L, U, N are not in the word

Therefore:
- Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Position 2 = A
- R must be in position 3 or 4 or 5 (but from AROSE, R is not in position 2; from TRAMP, R is not in position 2; from LUNAR, R is not in position 5; from RABID, R is not in position 1)
  - So R must be in position 3 or 4

Let me re-express:

From all feedback:
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 5
- Therefore R must be in position 3 or 4
- A is in position 2
- B is in the word but not in position 3
- Letters not in the word: O, S, E, T, M, P, L, U, N, I, D

So possible patterns:
1. _ A R _ _
2. _ A _ R _

Let's explore both.

Pattern 1: _ A R _ _
- Position 3 = R
- Position 2 = A
- Need positions 1, 4, 5
- Allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- B is in the word but not in position 3 (which is R), so B can be in 1, 4, or 5
- Let's find valid words:
  - B A R _ _ → B A R K Y → K, Y allowed
    - B A R K Y → valid word
    - Check letters: B, A, R, K, Y
    - R is in position 3 (allowed)
    - B is in position 1 (allowed)
    - K, Y are allowed
    - No excluded letters
  - C A R _ _ → C A R K Y → valid word
    - C, A, R, K, Y
    - R in 3
    - C, Y allowed
  - F A R _ _ → F A R K Y → valid word
    - F, A, R, K, Y
    - R in 3
    - F, Y allowed

Pattern 2: _ A _ R _
- Position 4 = R
- Need positions 1, 3, 5
- B must be in 1, 3, or 5 (but not 3)
  - So B in 1 or 5
- Let's find valid words:

    - B A C R Y → not a word

Thus, Pattern 1 seems to have valid words: BARKY, CARKY, FARKY, etc.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that will give us the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps eliminate or confirm many letters at once.

Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A word that uses several of these common letters is ""AROSE"". This word contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

Other good options could be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems like a particularly strong first guess because it covers five distinct common letters. This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.
- Contains A and R somewhere, but A is not first and R is not second.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R (but A not in 1st, R not in 2nd).
2. Does not use O, S, or E.
3. Uses 5 distinct letters (to maximize information).

Good remaining consonants and vowels: T, N, L, I, U, C, D, etc.

Possible candidates:
- TRAIL (but has L and I, and A is 3rd, R is 2nd - R is 2nd is bad)
- CRANK (A is 3rd, R is 2nd - R is 2nd is bad)
- DRANK (A is 3rd, R is 2nd - R is 2nd is bad)
- TRAIN (A is 2nd, R is 3rd - A is 2nd is allowed, R is 3rd is allowed)
- CRATE (E is excluded)
- TRAMP (A is 2nd, R is 1st - A is 2nd allowed, R is 1st allowed)
- TRASH (S is excluded)
- TRUNK (A is not present - bad)
- TRAMP seems good: T, R, A, M, P. No O, S, E. A is 2nd, R is 1st.

But let's check if we can do better. Maybe a word with more common letters.
- TRAIL (A is 3rd, R is 2nd - R is 2nd is bad)
- CRATE (E is excluded)
- BRISK (S is excluded)
- PRANK (A is 2nd, R is 1st - good)
- PRANK: P, R, A, N, K. No O, S, E. A is 2nd, R is 1st. This seems better than TRAMP because P and N/K are common.

Another option:
- CRANE (E is excluded)
- PRANK seems the best so far.

But let's think of another word: DRANK (A is 2nd, R is 1st, D, N, K - all allowed). DRANK has D, R, A, N, K.

Between PRANK and DRANK, both are good. PRANK uses P, which is common, while DRANK uses D. Both are fine.

Another candidate: TRAMP (T, R, A, M, P) - A is 2nd, R is 1st, no O/S/E. This seems very good.

But let's pick one. TRAMP has T, R, A, M, P. All letters allowed. A is 2nd, R is 1st - both positions are allowed.

So I'll go with TRAMP.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: TRAMP -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) M(x) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
   - O, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. TRAMP → T(x) R(-) A(-) M(x) P(x)
   - T, M, P are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (already knew that).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (already knew that).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, M, P
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, R
- Positions we have ruled out:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 3
  – R cannot be in positions 2 or 3
  – A cannot be in position 4 (because in TRAMP, A was in position 3, but that was already known; actually the feedback only shows A(-) meaning it’s in the word but not in position 3, so position 4 is still open for A)
  – R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE) and position 3 (from TRAMP), so R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and R
- Does NOT contain O, S, E, T, M, P
- A is not in positions 1 or 3
- R is not in positions 2 or 3

Remaining common letters to try: D, N, L, C, U, I, Y, B, G, H, K, etc.

Possible candidates:
- R A _ _ _ (but A cannot be in position 2, so R A _ _ _ is invalid)
- _ _ A _ _ (A in position 3 is invalid, so A must be in 2, 4, or 5)
- _ _ _ A _ (A in position 4 is allowed)
- _ _ _ _ A (A in position 5 is allowed)

Let’s try to find a word with A in position 2 or 4 or 5 and R in position 1, 4, or 5.

For example:
- R A _ _ _ → invalid (A in position 2 is allowed, but we need to check other constraints)
- _ A _ _ R → A in position 2, R in position 5
- _ _ A _ R → A in position 3 (invalid)
- _ _ _ A R → A in position 4, R in position 5
- _ _ R _ A → R in position 3 (invalid)
- _ R _ _ A → R in position 2 (invalid)
- R _ A _ _ → R in position 1, A in position 3 (invalid)
- R _ _ A _ → R in position 1, A in position 4
- R _ _ _ A → R in position 1, A in position 5

Let’s pick R _ _ A _ (R in 1, A in 4) and fill the middle letters with remaining allowed letters.

Possible letters left: D, N, L, C, U, I, Y, B, G, H, K, F, W, etc.

Looking for words:
- R U N A _ → RUNAS (invalid)
- R I N G A → RINGA (invalid)
- R I N K A → RINKA (invalid)
- R I N D A → RINDA (invalid)
- R U N D A → RUNDA (invalid)
- R I N G A → RINGA (invalid)
- R U N G A → RUNGA (invalid)
- R I N K A → RINKA (invalid)
- R I N D A → RINDA (invalid)
- R U N D A → RUNDA (invalid)
- R I N G A → RINGA (invalid)
- R U N G A → RUNGA (invalid)
- R I N K A → RINKA (invalid)

Hmm, let me think differently. Maybe A in position 2 and R in position 4 or 5.

For example:
- _ A _ R _ → A in 2, R in 4
- _ A _ _ R → A in 2, R in 5

Let’s try _ A _ R _:
- B A R R _ → invalid (double R)
- C A R R _ → invalid
- D A R R _ → invalid
- F A R R _ → invalid
- G A R R _ → invalid
- H A R R _ → invalid
- L A R R _ → invalid
- N A R R _ → invalid
- U A R R _ → invalid
- W A R R _ → invalid
- Y A R R _ → invalid

Not working. Try _ A _ _ R:
- B A N K R → BANKR (invalid)
- B A N D R → BANDR (invalid)
- C A N D R → CANDR (invalid)
- D A N K R → DANKR (invalid)
- F A N K R → FANKR (invalid)
- G A N K R → GANKR (invalid)
- H A N K R → HANKR (invalid)
- L A N K R → LANKR (invalid)
- N A K E R → NAKER (invalid)
- U A N K R → UANKR (invalid)
- W A N K R → WANKR (invalid)
- Y A N K R → YANKR (invalid)

Not working. Let’s try R _ _ _ A (R in 1, A in 5):
- R U N D A → RUNDA (invalid)
- R I N D A → RINDA (invalid)
- R U N G A → RUNGA (invalid)
- R I N G A → RINGA (invalid)
- R U N K A → RUNKA (invalid)
- R I N K A → RINKA (invalid)
- R U N D A → RUNDA (invalid)

Hmm, maybe A in position 4 and R in position 5:
- _ _ _ A R
- B U N A R → BUNAR (invalid)
- C U N A R → CUNAR (invalid)
- D U N A R → DUNAR (invalid)
- F U N A R → FUNAR (invalid)
- G U N A R → GUNAR (invalid)
- H U N A R → HUNAR (invalid)
- L U N A R → LUNAR (valid 5-letter word!)

LUNAR:
- Letters: L, U, N, A, R
- Contains A and R
- Does not contain O, S, E, T, M, P
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- R is in position 5 (allowed)
- All letters are allowed
- Valid English word

Looks perfect.

Let's consolidate everything we know so far.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x feedback):
O, S, E, T, M, P, L, U, N

Letters that ARE in the word (from the (-) feedback):
A, R

Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4
- R cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5

Therefore:
- A must be in position 2
- R must be in position 1 or 4

Remaining letters that have not been tried yet and are not excluded:
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we'll focus on common ones)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2
- Has R in position 1 or 4
- Uses only allowed letters
- Is a valid English word

Possible patterns:
1. R A _ _ _ (R in 1, A in 2)
2. _ A _ R _ (A in 2, R in 4)

Let's explore both patterns.

Pattern 1: R A _ _ _
We need three more letters after RA, none of which are in the excluded list.
Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, etc.
Possible words:
- R A B B Y → invalid (double B, Y is allowed)
- R A C E Y → E is excluded
- R A I N Y → N is excluded
- R A D I O → O is excluded
- R A I N S → S is excluded
- R A I N B → ""RAINB"" is not a word
- R A I N D → ""RAIND"" is not a word
- R A I N G → ""RAIN"" + G → ""RAIN"" is 4 letters, ""RAIN"" + G = ""RAIN"" but needs 5 letters
- R A I N K → ""RAINK"" is not a word
- R A I N Y → ""RAINY"" is a word but Y is allowed
  - Check letters: R, A, I, N, Y
  - N is excluded → invalid
- R A B I D → ""RABID"" is a word
  - Letters: R, A, B, I, D
  - All letters allowed (R, A, B, I, D)
  - R is in position 1 (allowed)
  - A is in position 2 (allowed)
  - No excluded letters
  - Valid English word

Pattern 2: _ A _ R _
We need letters before A and after R, none excluded.
Possible words:
- B A R R Y → double R
- C A R R Y → double R
- D A R R Y → double R
- F A R R Y → double R
- G A R R Y → double R
- H A R R Y → double R
- V A R R Y → double R
- W A R R Y → double R
- X A R R Y → double R
- Y A R R Y → double R
- Z A R R Y → double R
- All have double R → invalid
- B A R K Y → Y is allowed, but K is allowed
  - Letters: B, A, R, K, Y
  - R is in position 3 → invalid (R cannot be in 3)
- D A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- F A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- G A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- H A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- V A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- W A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- X A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- Y A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- Z A R K Y → R in 3 → invalid
- All have R in 3 → invalid

So Pattern 2 seems impossible because R would have to be in position 4, but we already have R in position 1 or 4, and position 4 is possible only if A is in 2 and R in 4, but we need to check if any word fits that.

Pattern 3: _ A _ _ R
A is in 2, R in 5
But R cannot be in 5 (from feedback: R(-) in LUNAR means R is not in position 5)
So this is invalid

Thus, only Pattern 1 seems viable.

R A B I D is a valid word that fits all constraints.

Let's verify:
- R A B I D
  - Letters: R, A, B, I, D
  - R in position 1 (allowed)
  - A in position 2 (allowed)
  - B, I, D are not excluded
  - No excluded letters (O, S, E, T, M, P, L, U, N are all absent)
  - Valid English word

Therefore, RABID is the next logical guess.

Let's update everything we now know after the fourth guess.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x feedback):
O, S, E, T, M, P, L, U, N, I, D

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or - feedback):
- A is in position 2 (✓ from RABID)
- R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (from AROSE, TRAMP, LUNAR, RABID)
  - Positions ruled out for R: 1, 2, 3, 5
  - Therefore R must be in position 4

So far:
- Position 2 = A
- Position 4 = R

Remaining letters to fill: positions 1, 3, 5
Allowed letters (not excluded): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
(But we want common letters; focus on B, C, F, G, H, K, W, Y)

We need a valid 5-letter English word with pattern:
_ A _ R _

Let's list possible words:
- B A C R Y → not a word
- B A G R Y → not a word
- B A H R Y → not a word
- C A B R Y → not a word
- C A F R Y → not a word
- C A G R Y → not a word

- Y A F R Y → not a word
- Y A G R Y → not a word
- Y A K R Y → not a word
- Y A V R Y → not a word
- Y A W R Y → not a word

Hmm, none of these seem to be valid words. Let's double-check the pattern and constraints.

Wait, the pattern is _ A _ R _ with:
- Position 2 = A
- Position 4 = R
- Positions 1, 3, 5 must be from allowed letters (B, C, F, G, H, K, W, Y)

Let me think of actual words:
- B A C K R → not a word
- B A C K Y → not a word
- B A C K S → S is excluded
- C A P R Y → P is excluded
- C A R R Y → R is already in position 4, so double R is invalid
- C A R S Y → S is excluded
- F A C T R → not a word
- F A C T S → S is excluded
- G A M E R → M is excluded
- G A M E Y → M is excluded
- H A N G R → N is excluded
- H A N G S → S is excluded
- K A R T Y → K, A, R, T, Y → T is excluded
- K A R T Y is invalid
- V A L U R → L is excluded
- V A L U E → E is excluded
- W A R D R → D is excluded
- W A R D Y → D is excluded
- Y A R D Y → D is excluded

Wait, let's list valid 5-letter words with pattern _ A _ R _ and check letters:

Valid English words:
- B A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- C A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- F A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- G A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- H A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- V A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- W A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- X A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- Y A R R Y → double R (invalid)
- Z A R R Y → double R (invalid)

None of these are valid because they have double R. But we have R in position 4, so position 3 must be something else.

Wait, the word must be _ A _ R _ with:
- Position 1: any allowed letter
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: any allowed letter
- Position 4: R
- Position 5: any allowed letter

Let me think differently. Maybe the word is B A R K Y → but K is allowed and Y is allowed, but R would be in position 3 which is invalid (R cannot be in position 3). Similarly, C A R K Y → R in 3 invalid.

Wait, let's list all valid 5-letter words with pattern _ A _ R _ and check letters:

Looking up valid words:
- B A R K Y → R in 3 invalid
- B A R R Y → double R invalid
- C A R K Y → R in 3 invalid
- C A R R Y → double R invalid
- F A R K Y → R in 3 invalid
- G A R K Y → R in 3 invalid
- H A R K Y → R in 3 invalid
- V A R K Y → R in 3 invalid
- W A R K Y → R in 3 invalid

None of these fit. Let me think of other words:

- B A G R Y → not a word
- B A F R Y → not a word
- B A H R Y → not a word
- B A K R Y → not a word
- B A V R Y → not a word

- Y A G R Y → not a word
- Y A H R Y → not a word
- Y A K R Y → not a word
- Y A V R Y → not a word
- Y A W R Y → not a word

This is perplexing. None of these seem to be valid words. Let me re-examine the constraints.

Wait, the word must be _ A _ R _ with:
- Position 2 = A
- Position 4 = R
- Positions 1, 3, 5 must be from allowed letters (B, C, F, G, H, K, W, Y)

Let me think of actual words:
- B A K R Y → not a word
- B A F R Y → not a word
- C A K R Y → not a word
- C A F R Y → not a word
- F A K R Y → not a word
- F A C R Y → not a word
- G A K R Y → not a word
- G A C R Y → not a word
- H A K R Y → not a word
- H A C R Y → not a word
- K A C R Y → not a word
- K A C R Y → not a word
- V A K R Y → not a word
- V A C R Y → not a word
- W A K R Y → not a word
- W A C R Y → not a word

This suggests there might be no valid words left, which is unlikely. Let me check if I missed any letters.

Allowed letters left: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let me think of words with pattern _ A _ R _ using these letters:

This is impossible. There must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Let me re-examine the constraints:

From the feedback:
- A is in position 2 (✓ from RABID)
- R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (from AROSE, TRAMP, LUNAR, RABID)
  - Therefore R must be in position 4
- So the word is _ A _ R _

But I can't find any valid 5-letter English word with this pattern. This suggests I might have missed a letter or misinterpreted the feedback.

Wait, let me re-check the feedback for RABID:
RABID → R(-) A(✓) B(-) I(x) D(x)

- R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 1
- A(✓) means A is in position 2
- B(-) means B is in the word but not in position 3
- I(x) means I is not in the word
- D(x) means D is not in the word

So:
- R is in the word but not in position 1
- A is in position 2
- B is in the word but not in position 3
- I and D are not in the word
- O, S, E, T, M, P, L, U, N are not in the word

Therefore:
- Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Position 2 = A
- R must be in position 3 or 4 or 5 (but from AROSE, R is not in position 2; from TRAMP, R is not in position 2; from LUNAR, R is not in position 5; from RABID, R is not in position 1)
  - So R must be in position 3 or 4

Let me re-express:

From all feedback:
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 5
- Therefore R must be in position 3 or 4
- A is in position 2
- B is in the word but not in position 3
- Letters not in the word: O, S, E, T, M, P, L, U, N, I, D

So possible patterns:
1. _ A R _ _
2. _ A _ R _

Let's explore both.

Pattern 1: _ A R _ _
- Position 3 = R
- Position 2 = A
- Need positions 1, 4, 5
- Allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- B is in the word but not in position 3 (which is R), so B can be in 1, 4, or 5
- Let's find valid words:
  - B A R _ _ → B A R K Y → K, Y allowed
    - B A R K Y → valid word
    - Check letters: B, A, R, K, Y
    - R is in position 3 (allowed)
    - B is in position 1 (allowed)
    - K, Y are allowed
    - No excluded letters
  - C A R _ _ → C A R K Y → valid word
    - C, A, R, K, Y
    - R in 3
    - C, Y allowed
  - F A R _ _ → F A R K Y → valid word
    - F, A, R, K, Y
    - R in 3
    - F, Y allowed

Pattern 2: _ A _ R _
- Position 4 = R
- Need positions 1, 3, 5
- B must be in 1, 3, or 5 (but not 3)
  - So B in 1 or 5
- Let's find valid words:
  - B A _ R _
    - B A C R Y → not a word
    - B A F R Y → not a word
    - B A G R Y → not a word
    - B A H R Y → not a word
    - B A K R Y → not a word
    - B A V R Y → not a word
    - B A W R Y → not a word
  - _ A B R _ → but A is in 2, so this would be _ A B R _
    - C A B R Y → not a word
    - F A B R Y → not a word
    - G A B R Y → not a word
    - H A B R Y → not a word
    - V A B R Y → not a word
    - W A B R Y → not a word
  - _ A _ R B
    - C A K R B → not a word
    - F A K R B → not a word
    - G A K R B → not a word
    - H A K R B → not a word
    - V A K R B → not a word
    - W A K R B → not a word
  - _ A _ R Y
    - C A K R Y → not a word
    - F A K R Y → not a word
    - G A K R Y → not a word
    - H A K R Y → not a word
    - V A K R Y → not a word
    - W A K R Y → not a word

Thus, Pattern 1 seems to have valid words: BARKY, CARKY, FARKY, etc.

Let me choose BARKY.

Check BARKY:
- B A R K Y
- Letters: B, A, R, K, Y
- R is in position 3 (allowed)
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- B is in position 1 (allowed)
- K, Y are allowed
- No excluded letters
- Valid English word

Therefore, BARKY is the next guess.

From the latest feedback on BARKY:

B(✓) A(✓) R(✓) K(x) Y(✓)

This tells us:

- B is in position 1
- A is in position 2
- R is in position 3
- Y is in position 5
- K is NOT in the word (already knew)

So the word structure is now:

B A R _ Y

Only position 4 is unknown, and it must be a letter that has not yet been ruled out.

Letters already ruled out (x feedback):
O, S, E, T, M, P, L, U, N, I, D, K

Allowed letters left (common ones):
C, F, G, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Z

Looking for valid 5-letter English words fitting B A R _ Y:

- B A R C Y → not a word
- B A R F Y → not a word
- B A R G Y → ""BARGY"" is not standard
- B A R H Y → not a word
- B A R J Y → not a word
- B A R Q Y → not a word
- B A R V Y → not a word
- B A R W Y → not a word
- B A R X Y → not a word
- B A R Z Y → not a word

Wait, ""BARRY"" is a word but it repeats R. Since we already have R in position 3, repeating R would make position 4 R, but R is already in position 3 and we don't have info against it. However, ""BARRY"" is valid.

But let's check if there's another option. The only common word that fits is ""BARRY"".

Check BARRY:
- B A R R Y
- Letters: B, A, R, R, Y
- Positions: 1=B, 2=A, 3=R, 4=R, 5=Y
- R is allowed in position 4 (no feedback against it)
- Valid English word

Therefore, the secret word must be BARRY.

Wait, ""BARRY"" is a word but it repeats R. Since we already have R in position 3, repeating R would make position 4 R, but R is already in position 3 and we don't have info against it. However, ""BARRY"" is valid.

But let's check if there's another option. The only common word that fits is ""BARRY"".

Check BARRY:
- B A R R Y
- Letters: B, A, R, R, Y
- Positions: 1=B, 2=A, 3=R, 4=R, 5=Y
- R is allowed in position 4 (no feedback against it)
- Valid English word

Therefore, the secret word must be BARRY.",Guess 6: BARRY -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) A(✓) R(✓) R(-) Y(✓),FAIL
