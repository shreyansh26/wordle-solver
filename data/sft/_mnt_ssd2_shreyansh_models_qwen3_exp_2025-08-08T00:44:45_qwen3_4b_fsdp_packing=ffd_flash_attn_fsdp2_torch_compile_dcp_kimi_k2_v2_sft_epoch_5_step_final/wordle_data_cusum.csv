For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter S somewhere other than position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels (like I, U, T, N, L, etc.).

A good next guess should test new common letters while placing S in a different spot. ""SLINT"" is a valid word, but let's pick something more common. ""STING"" is great because:
- S is in position 1 (new position).
- T, I, N, G are all common letters we haven't tested yet.
- Avoids A, R, O, E.

Let's go with STING.

- S must appear in a position other than 4 (from AROSE) or 1 (from STING), so possible positions for S: 2, 3, or 5.

1. Place S in a new position (2, 3, or 5).
2. Introduce several fresh, common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses:

Letters NOT in the word at all:  
A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, L, P  

Letters that ARE in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown):  
S, U, M  

Positions ruled out for each of these:  
- S cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from STING and AROSE).  
  Therefore S must be in position 2 or 3.  
- U cannot be in position 3 (from SLUMP).  
- M cannot be in position 4 (from SLUMP).

So the word structure must be:  
_ S _ _ _   or   _ _ S _ _

and must contain the letters S, U, M in some order, plus two more letters that have not yet been tested and are not in the forbidden list.

Remaining common letters not yet tried:  
B, C, D, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the vowels Y (which acts as a vowel).

We need two more letters (positions not yet filled by S, U, M) from the unused set.  
Let’s pick two that are common and haven’t been ruled out: B and D.

Possible placements:  
- If S is in position 2:  
  _ S _ _ _  
  We need to place U and M in positions 3,4,5 with no conflicts.  
  Try S U M in positions 2,3,4: but that would put U in position 3 which is forbidden.  
  Try S M U in positions 2,3,4: U is in 4 (allowed).  
  Then we need two more letters in positions 1 and 5.  
  From unused: B, C, D, F, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.  
  Let’s try B and D: B S M U D → “BSMUD” is not a valid word.  
  Try D S M U B → “DSMUB” is invalid.

- If S is in position 3:  
  _ _ S _ _  
  We need to place U and M in positions 1,2,4,5 with no conflicts.  
  U cannot be in position 3 (already S), so it can be in 1,2,4,5.  
  M cannot be in position 4, so it can be in 1,2,5.

After checking all placements of S, U, M with the remaining letters, none of the combinations form valid 5-letter words. This suggests we need to introduce different unused letters. Let’s try adding C and H instead of B and D.

Try S in position 3: _ _ S _ _  
Place U and M in positions 1,2,4,5.

After exhausting common letters, let’s try introducing Y and Z.

Z S M U Y → “ZSMUY” invalid.  
None are valid words.

After checking all combinations, the only valid 5-letter word that fits the constraints is “SMUCK” (but C is unused and K is unused). Let me check:

SMUCK:  
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since S can be in 2,3,5).  
- M is in position 2 (allowed).  
- U is in position 3 (allowed).  
- C and K are new letters not yet tested.  

However, “SMUCK” is valid and fits all constraints.

Let me verify:  
- S is in the word (✓).  
- M is in the word (✓).  
- U is in the word (✓).  
- C and K are new letters.  

Therefore, the next logical guess is SMUCK.

</think>

Based on the constraints we now have (S must be in positions 2 or 3, and must be accompanied by U and M), and introducing two new letters (C and K), the word SMUCK fits perfectly.

<guess>SMUCK</guess>",SMUCK,"Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses:

Letters NOT in the word at all:  
A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, L, P  

Letters that ARE in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown):  
S, U, M  

Positions ruled out for each of these:  
- S cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from STING and AROSE).  
  Therefore S must be in position 2 or 3.  
- U cannot be in position 3 (from SLUMP).  
- M cannot be in position 4 (from SLUMP).

So the word structure must be:  
_ S _ _ _   or   _ _ S _ _

and must contain the letters S, U, M in some order, plus two more letters that have not yet been tested and are not in the forbidden list.

Remaining common letters not yet tried:  
B, C, D, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the vowels Y (which acts as a vowel).

We need two more letters (positions not yet filled by S, U, M) from the unused set.  
Let’s pick two that are common and haven’t been ruled out: B and D.

Possible placements:  
- If S is in position 2:  
  _ S _ _ _  
  We need to place U and M in positions 3,4,5 with no conflicts.  
  Try S U M in positions 2,3,4: but that would put U in position 3 which is forbidden.  
  Try S M U in positions 2,3,4: U is in 4 (allowed).  
  Then we need two more letters in positions 1 and 5.  
  From unused: B, C, D, F, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.  
  Let’s try B and D: B S M U D → “BSMUD” is not a valid word.

- If S is in position 3:  
  _ _ S _ _  
  We need to place U and M in positions 1,2,4,5 with no conflicts.  
  U cannot be in position 3 (already S), so it can be in 1,2,4,5.  
  M cannot be in position 4, so it can be in 1,2,5.

SMUCK:

- M is in position 2 (allowed).  
- U is in position 3 (allowed).  
- C and K are new letters not yet tested.  

However, “SMUCK” is valid and fits all constraints.

Let me verify:  
- S is in the word (✓).  
- M is in the word (✓).  
- U is in the word (✓).  
- C and K are new letters.  

Therefore, the next logical guess is SMUCK.Based on the constraints we now have (S must be in positions 2 or 3, and must be accompanied by U and M), and introducing two new letters (C and K), the word SMUCK fits perfectly.",Guess 4: SMUCK -> FEEDBACK: S(-) M(-) U(-) C(-) K(x),FAIL

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter S somewhere other than position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels (like I, U, T, N, L, etc.).

A good next guess should test new common letters while placing S in a different spot. ""SLINT"" is a valid word, but let's pick something more common. ""STING"" is great because:
- S is in position 1 (new position).
- T, I, N, G are all common letters we haven't tested yet.
- Avoids A, R, O, E.

Let's go with STING.

Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(x) N(x) G(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S (from both guesses, and both times it was marked “-”, meaning it’s in the word but not in the position guessed)

So the secret word:
- Contains S exactly once (since we haven’t seen it marked “✓” anywhere).
- Does NOT contain any of A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G.
- S must appear in a position other than 4 (from AROSE) or 1 (from STING), so possible positions for S: 2, 3, or 5.

We still need to test the remaining common consonants and vowels: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Place S in a new position (2, 3, or 5).
2. Introduce several fresh, common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Let’s try “SLUMP”:
- S is in position 2 (new placement).
- L, U, M, P are all untested common letters.
- Avoids every excluded letter.

This will give us information on four new letters while repositioning S.

<|im_end|>

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses:

Letters NOT in the word at all:  
A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, L, P  

Letters that ARE in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown):  
S, U, M  

Positions ruled out for each of these:  
- S cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from STING and AROSE).  
  Therefore S must be in position 2 or 3.  
- U cannot be in position 3 (from SLUMP).  
- M cannot be in position 4 (from SLUMP).

So the word structure must be:  
_ S _ _ _   or   _ _ S _ _

and must contain the letters S, U, M in some order, plus two more letters that have not yet been tested and are not in the forbidden list.

Remaining common letters not yet tried:  
B, C, D, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the vowels Y (which acts as a vowel).

We need two more letters (positions not yet filled by S, U, M) from the unused set.  
Let’s pick two that are common and haven’t been ruled out: B and D.

Possible placements:  
- If S is in position 2:  
  _ S _ _ _  
  We need to place U and M in positions 3,4,5 with no conflicts.  
  Try S U M in positions 2,3,4: but that would put U in position 3 which is forbidden.  
  Try S M U in positions 2,3,4: U is in 4 (allowed).  
  Then we need two more letters in positions 1 and 5.  
  From unused: B, C, D, F, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.  
  Let’s try B and D: B S M U D → “BSMUD” is not a valid word.  
  Try D S M U B → “DSMUB” is invalid.  
  Try B S U M D → “BSUMD” invalid.  
  Try D S U M B → “DSUMB” invalid.

  None of these are valid 5-letter words.

- If S is in position 3:  
  _ _ S _ _  
  We need to place U and M in positions 1,2,4,5 with no conflicts.  
  U cannot be in position 3 (already S), so it can be in 1,2,4,5.  
  M cannot be in position 4, so it can be in 1,2,5.

Let’s try U in position 1 and M in position 2: U M S _ _

Let’s update what we know after the four guesses:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, L, P, K  

Letters that ARE in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown):  
S, M, U, C  

Positions ruled out for each of these:  
- S cannot be in positions 1, 4, 5 (from STING, AROSE, SMUCK).  
  Therefore S must be in position 2 or 3.  
- M cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4 (from SMUCK, SLUMP).  
  Therefore M must be in position 3 or 5.  
- U cannot be in positions 3, 4 (from SLUMP, SMUCK).  
  Therefore U must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
- C cannot be in position 4 (from SMUCK).  
  Therefore C must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We still need one more letter (since we have four known letters and the word is five letters).  
The only letters not yet ruled out that are common and not yet tested are: B, D, F, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Let’s pick B and D (common and unused).

Now we must place S, M, U, C, and one new letter (B or D) into the word while respecting the positional restrictions.

Possible word structures:
- S must be in position 2 or 3.  
- M must be in position 3 or 5.  
- U must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
- C must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s try to build a valid word:

Case 1: S in position 2  
Structure: _ S _ _ _  
Then M must be in position 3 or 5.  
If M is in position 3: _ S M _ _  
U must be in position 1 or 5.  
C must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
Position 2 is S, position 3 is M, so C must be in position 1 or 5.  
- If C is in position 1: C S M _ _  
  U must be in position 5: C S M _ U  
  The only remaining letter is B or D.  
  C S M B U → “CSMBU” invalid.  
  C S M D U → “CSMDU” invalid.  
- If C is in position 5: _ S M _ C  
  U must be in position 1: U S M _ C  
  The only remaining letter is B or D.  
  U S M B C → “USMBC” invalid.  
  U S M D C → “USMDC” invalid.  

Case 2: S in position 3  
Structure: _ _ S _ _  
Then M must be in position 5: _ _ S _ M  
U must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
Position 5 is M, so U must be in position 1 or 2.  
C must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
Position 3 is S, position 5 is M, so C must be in position 1 or 2.  
- If C is in position 1: C _ S _ M  
  U must be in position 2: C U S _ M  
  The only remaining letter is B or D.  
  C U S B M → “CUSBM” invalid.  
  C U S D M → “CUSDM” invalid.  
- If C is in position 2: _ C S _ M  
  U must be in position 1: U C S _ M  
  The only remaining letter is B or D.  
  U C S B M → “UCSBM” invalid.  
  U C S D M → “UCSDM” invalid.  

Case 3: S in position 2, M in position 5  
Structure: _ S _ _ M  
Then U must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
Position 2 is S, position 5 is M, so U must be in position 1: U S _ _ M  
C must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
Position 1 is U, position 2 is S, position 5 is M, so C must be in position 3 or 4.  
- If C is in position 3: U S C _ M  
  The only remaining letter is B or D.  
  U S C B M → “USCBM” invalid.  
  U S C D M → “USCDM” invalid.  
- If C is in position 4: U S _ C M  
  The only remaining letter is B or D.  
  U S B C M → “USBCM” invalid.  
  U S D C M → “USDCM” invalid.  

Case 4: S in position 3, M in position 5  
Structure: _ _ S _ M  
U must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
Position 5 is M, so U must be in position 1 or 2.  
C must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
Position 3 is S, position 5 is M, so C must be in position 1 or 2.  
- If C is in position 1: C _ S _ M  
  U must be in position 2: C U S _ M  
  The only remaining letter is B or D.  
  C U S B M → “CUSBM” invalid.  
  C U S D M → “CUSDM” invalid.  
- If C is in position 2: _ C S _ M  
  U must be in position 1: U C S _ M  
  The only remaining letter is B or D.  
  U C S B M → “UCSBM” invalid.  
  U C S D M → “UCSDM” invalid.  

After checking all possible positions, the only valid word that fits all constraints is “CUSBM” or “CUSDM”, but these are invalid. This suggests we need to try a different approach.

Let me try introducing a new letter, say D, and see if we can form a valid word.

Try structure: C U S D M → invalid.  
Try structure: U C S D M → invalid.  
Try structure: U D S C M → invalid.  
Try structure: D U S C M → invalid.  

Wait, let me try a different set of letters. Instead of C and K, we could use other unused letters. But K is already ruled out.

Actually, the only remaining unused common letters are B and D. Let me try a different word structure.

Try structure: C U D S M → invalid.  
Try structure: U C D S M → invalid.  

This seems impossible. Let me re-examine the constraints.

We have four known letters: S, M, U, C. We need one more letter. The only common unused letters are B and D. Let me try to form a valid word with these letters.

Possible valid words:
- C U S D M → invalid.  
- C U D S M → invalid.  
- U C S D M → invalid.  
- U D S C M → invalid.  

This suggests I might have missed a valid word. Let me think differently.

Actually, the word “CUSUM” is valid, but M is already in position 5, and U is in position 2. Let me check:

CUSUM:
- C (1)  
- U (2)  
- S (3)  
- U (4)  
- M (5)  

But U cannot be in position 4 (from SMUCK feedback). So this is invalid.

Another valid word: “CUSPY” – but Y is new and P is ruled out.

Another valid word: “CUSPS” – but P is ruled out.

Another valid word: “CUBUS” – but B is new, U is repeated, which is allowed.

CUBUS:
- C (1)  
- U (2)  
- B (3)  
- U (4)  
- S (5)  

Check constraints:
- S is in position 5 – allowed.  
- M is missing – invalid.  

We need M somewhere.

Another valid word: “MUSCU” – but C is in position 4, which is allowed, U in 2, S in 3, M in 1.

MUSCU:
- M (1) – allowed.  
- U (2) – allowed.  
- S (3) – allowed.  
- C (4) – allowed.  
- U (5) – allowed.  

This fits all constraints!

Let me verify:
- Letters: M, U, S, C, U.  
- S is in position 3 – allowed.  
- M is in position 1 – allowed.  
- U is in positions 2 and 5 – allowed.  
- C is in position 4 – allowed.  
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, L, P, K).  

Thus, the next logical guess is MUSCU.
</think>

<guess>MUSCU</guess>",MUSCU,"Let’s update what we know after the four guesses:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, L, P, K  

Letters that ARE in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown):  
S, M, U, C  

Positions ruled out for each of these:  
- S cannot be in positions 1, 4, 5 (from STING, AROSE, SMUCK).  
  Therefore S must be in position 2 or 3.  
- M cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4 (from SMUCK, SLUMP).  
  Therefore M must be in position 3 or 5.  
- U cannot be in positions 3, 4 (from SLUMP, SMUCK).  
  Therefore U must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
- C cannot be in position 4 (from SMUCK).  
  Therefore C must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We still need one more letter (since we have four known letters and the word is five letters).  
The only letters not yet ruled out that are common and not yet tested are: B, D, F, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Let’s pick B and D (common and unused).

Now we must place S, M, U, C, and one new letter (B or D) into the word while respecting the positional restrictions.

Possible word structures:
- S must be in position 2 or 3.  
- M must be in position 3 or 5.  
- U must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
- C must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s try to build a valid word:

Case 1: S in position 2  
Structure: _ S _ _ _  
Then M must be in position 3 or 5.  
If M is in position 3: _ S M _ _  
U must be in position 1 or 5.  
C must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
Position 2 is S, position 3 is M, so C must be in position 1 or 5.  
- If C is in position 1: C S M _ _  
  U must be in position 5: C S M _ U  
  The only remaining letter is B or D.  
  C S M B U → “CSMBU” invalid.  
  C S M D U → “CSMDU” invalid.  
- If C is in position 5: _ S M _ C  
  U must be in position 1: U S M _ C  
  The only remaining letter is B or D.  
  U S M B C → “USMBC” invalid.  
  U S M D C → “USMDC” invalid.  

Case 2: S in position 3  
Structure: _ _ S _ _  
Then M must be in position 5: _ _ S _ M  
U must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
Position 5 is M, so U must be in position 1 or 2.  
C must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
Position 3 is S, position 5 is M, so C must be in position 1 or 2.  
- If C is in position 1: C _ S _ M  
  U must be in position 2: C U S _ M  
  The only remaining letter is B or D.  
  C U S B M → “CUSBM” invalid.  
  C U S D M → “CUSDM” invalid.  
- If C is in position 2: _ C S _ M  
  U must be in position 1: U C S _ M  
  The only remaining letter is B or D.  
  U C S B M → “UCSBM” invalid.  
  U C S D M → “UCSDM” invalid.  

Case 3: S in position 2, M in position 5  
Structure: _ S _ _ M  
Then U must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
Position 2 is S, position 5 is M, so U must be in position 1: U S _ _ M  
C must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
Position 1 is U, position 2 is S, position 5 is M, so C must be in position 3 or 4.  
- If C is in position 3: U S C _ M  
  The only remaining letter is B or D.  
  U S C B M → “USCBM” invalid.  
  U S C D M → “USCDM” invalid.  
- If C is in position 4: U S _ C M  
  The only remaining letter is B or D.  
  U S B C M → “USBCM” invalid.  
  U S D C M → “USDCM” invalid.  

Case 4: S in position 3, M in position 5  
Structure: _ _ S _ M  
U must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
Position 5 is M, so U must be in position 1 or 2.  
C must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
Position 3 is S, position 5 is M, so C must be in position 1 or 2.  
- If C is in position 1: C _ S _ M  
  U must be in position 2: C U S _ M  
  The only remaining letter is B or D.  
  C U S B M → “CUSBM” invalid.  
  C U S D M → “CUSDM” invalid.  
- If C is in position 2: _ C S _ M  
  U must be in position 1: U C S _ M  
  The only remaining letter is B or D.  
  U C S B M → “UCSBM” invalid.  
  U C S D M → “UCSDM” invalid.  

After checking all possible positions, the only valid word that fits all constraints is “CUSBM” or “CUSDM”, but these are invalid. This suggests we need to try a different approach.

Let me try introducing a new letter, say D, and see if we can form a valid word.

Try structure: C U S D M → invalid.  
Try structure: U C S D M → invalid.  
Try structure: U D S C M → invalid.  
Try structure: D U S C M → invalid.  

Wait, let me try a different set of letters. Instead of C and K, we could use other unused letters. But K is already ruled out.

Actually, the only remaining unused common letters are B and D. Let me try a different word structure.

Try structure: C U D S M → invalid.  
Try structure: U C D S M → invalid.  

This seems impossible. Let me re-examine the constraints.

We have four known letters: S, M, U, C. We need one more letter. The only common unused letters are B and D. Let me try to form a valid word with these letters.

Possible valid words:
- C U S D M → invalid.  
- C U D S M → invalid.  
- U C S D M → invalid.  
- U D S C M → invalid.  

This suggests I might have missed a valid word. Let me think differently.

Actually, the word “CUSUM” is valid, but M is already in position 5, and U is in position 2. Let me check:

CUSUM:
- C (1)  
- U (2)  
- S (3)  
- U (4)  
- M (5)  

But U cannot be in position 4 (from SMUCK feedback). So this is invalid.

Another valid word: “CUSPY” – but Y is new and P is ruled out.

Another valid word: “CUSPS” – but P is ruled out.

Another valid word: “CUBUS” – but B is new, U is repeated, which is allowed.

CUBUS:
- C (1)  
- U (2)  
- B (3)  
- U (4)  
- S (5)  

Check constraints:
- S is in position 5 – allowed.  
- M is missing – invalid.  

We need M somewhere.

Another valid word: “MUSCU” – but C is in position 4, which is allowed, U in 2, S in 3, M in 1.

MUSCU:
- M (1) – allowed.  
- U (2) – allowed.  
- S (3) – allowed.  
- C (4) – allowed.  
- U (5) – allowed.  

This fits all constraints!

Let me verify:
- Letters: M, U, S, C, U.  
- S is in position 3 – allowed.  
- M is in position 1 – allowed.  
- U is in positions 2 and 5 – allowed.  
- C is in position 4 – allowed.  
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, L, P, K).  

Thus, the next logical guess is MUSCU.",Guess 5: MUSCU -> FEEDBACK: M(-) U(✓) S(✓) C(-) U(-),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The best starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are not in the word at all (x).
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter S somewhere other than position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels (like I, U, T, N, L, etc.).

A good next guess should test new common letters while placing S in a different spot. ""SLINT"" is a valid word, but let's pick something more common. ""STING"" is great because:
- S is in position 1 (new position).
- T, I, N, G are all common letters we haven't tested yet.
- Avoids A, R, O, E.

Let's go with STING.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(x) N(x) G(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: S (from both guesses, and both times it was marked “-”, meaning it’s in the word but not in the position guessed)

So the secret word:
- Contains S exactly once (since we haven’t seen it marked “✓” anywhere).
- Does NOT contain any of A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G.
- S must appear in a position other than 4 (from AROSE) or 1 (from STING), so possible positions for S: 2, 3, or 5.

We still need to test the remaining common consonants and vowels: B, C, D, F, H, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
1. Place S in a new position (2, 3, or 5).
2. Introduce several fresh, common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Let’s try “SLUMP”:
- S is in position 2 (new placement).
- L, U, M, P are all untested common letters.
- Avoids every excluded letter.

This will give us information on four new letters while repositioning S.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses:

Letters NOT in the word at all:  
A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, L, P  

Letters that ARE in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown):  
S, U, M  

Positions ruled out for each of these:  
- S cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from STING and AROSE).  
  Therefore S must be in position 2 or 3.  
- U cannot be in position 3 (from SLUMP).  
- M cannot be in position 4 (from SLUMP).

So the word structure must be:  
_ S _ _ _   or   _ _ S _ _

and must contain the letters S, U, M in some order, plus two more letters that have not yet been tested and are not in the forbidden list.

Remaining common letters not yet tried:  
B, C, D, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the vowels Y (which acts as a vowel).

We need two more letters (positions not yet filled by S, U, M) from the unused set.  
Let’s pick two that are common and haven’t been ruled out: B and D.

Possible placements:  
- If S is in position 2:  
  _ S _ _ _  
  We need to place U and M in positions 3,4,5 with no conflicts.  
  Try S U M in positions 2,3,4: but that would put U in position 3 which is forbidden.  
  Try S M U in positions 2,3,4: U is in 4 (allowed).  
  Then we need two more letters in positions 1 and 5.  
  From unused: B, C, D, F, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.  
  Let’s try B and D: B S M U D → “BSMUD” is not a valid word.  
  Try D S M U B → “DSMUB” is invalid.  
  Try B S U M D → “BSUMD” invalid.  
  Try D S U M B → “DSUMB” invalid.  
  Try C S M U B → “CSUMB” invalid.  
  Try F S M U B → “FSUMB” invalid.  
  Try H S M U B → “HSMUB” invalid.  
  Try K S M U B → “KSMUB” invalid.

  Try V S M U Y → “VSMUY” invalid.  
  Try W S M U Y → “WSMUY” invalid.  
  Try Y S M U Y → “YSMUY” invalid.  
  None of these are valid 5-letter words.

- If S is in position 3:  
  _ _ S _ _  
  We need to place U and M in positions 1,2,4,5 with no conflicts.  
  U cannot be in position 3 (already S), so it can be in 1,2,4,5.  
  M cannot be in position 4, so it can be in 1,2,5.

Let’s try U in position 1 and M in position 2: U M S _ _  
Then positions 4 and 5 need two unused letters.  
From unused: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

After checking all placements of S, U, M with the remaining letters, none of the combinations form valid 5-letter words. This suggests we need to introduce different unused letters. Let’s try adding C and H instead of B and D.

None are valid words.

After checking all combinations, the only valid 5-letter word that fits the constraints is “SMUCK” (but C is unused and K is unused). Let me check:

SMUCK:  
- S is in position 1 (allowed, since S can be in 2,3,5).  
- M is in position 2 (allowed).  
- U is in position 3 (allowed).  
- C and K are new letters not yet tested.  

However, “SMUCK” is valid and fits all constraints.

Let me verify:  
- S is in the word (✓).  
- M is in the word (✓).  
- U is in the word (✓).  
- C and K are new letters.  

Therefore, the next logical guess is SMUCK.Based on the constraints we now have (S must be in positions 2 or 3, and must be accompanied by U and M), and introducing two new letters (C and K), the word SMUCK fits perfectly.

Let’s update what we know after the four guesses:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, L, P, K  

Letters that ARE in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown):  
S, M, U, C  

Positions ruled out for each of these:  
- S cannot be in positions 1, 4, 5 (from STING, AROSE, SMUCK).  
  Therefore S must be in position 2 or 3.  
- M cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4 (from SMUCK, SLUMP).  
  Therefore M must be in position 3 or 5.  
- U cannot be in positions 3, 4 (from SLUMP, SMUCK).  
  Therefore U must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
- C cannot be in position 4 (from SMUCK).  
  Therefore C must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We still need one more letter (since we have four known letters and the word is five letters).  
The only letters not yet ruled out that are common and not yet tested are: B, D, F, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Let’s pick B and D (common and unused).

Now we must place S, M, U, C, and one new letter (B or D) into the word while respecting the positional restrictions.

Possible word structures:
- S must be in position 2 or 3.  
- M must be in position 3 or 5.  
- U must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
- C must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Let’s try to build a valid word:

Case 1: S in position 2  
Structure: _ S _ _ _  
Then M must be in position 3 or 5.  
If M is in position 3: _ S M _ _  
U must be in position 1 or 5.  
C must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
Position 2 is S, position 3 is M, so C must be in position 1 or 5.  
- If C is in position 1: C S M _ _  
  U must be in position 5: C S M _ U  
  The only remaining letter is B or D.  
  C S M B U → “CSMBU” invalid.  
  C S M D U → “CSMDU” invalid.  
- If C is in position 5: _ S M _ C  
  U must be in position 1: U S M _ C  
  The only remaining letter is B or D.  
  U S M B C → “USMBC” invalid.  
  U S M D C → “USMDC” invalid.  

Case 2: S in position 3  
Structure: _ _ S _ _  
Then M must be in position 5: _ _ S _ M  
U must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
Position 5 is M, so U must be in position 1 or 2.  
C must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
Position 3 is S, position 5 is M, so C must be in position 1 or 2.  
- If C is in position 1: C _ S _ M  
  U must be in position 2: C U S _ M  
  The only remaining letter is B or D.  
  C U S B M → “CUSBM” invalid.  
  C U S D M → “CUSDM” invalid.  
- If C is in position 2: _ C S _ M  
  U must be in position 1: U C S _ M  
  The only remaining letter is B or D.  
  U C S B M → “UCSBM” invalid.  
  U C S D M → “UCSDM” invalid.  

Case 3: S in position 2, M in position 5  
Structure: _ S _ _ M  
Then U must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
Position 2 is S, position 5 is M, so U must be in position 1: U S _ _ M  
C must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
Position 1 is U, position 2 is S, position 5 is M, so C must be in position 3 or 4.  
- If C is in position 3: U S C _ M  
  The only remaining letter is B or D.  
  U S C B M → “USCBM” invalid.  
  U S C D M → “USCDM” invalid.  
- If C is in position 4: U S _ C M  
  The only remaining letter is B or D.  
  U S B C M → “USBCM” invalid.  
  U S D C M → “USDCM” invalid.  

Case 4: S in position 3, M in position 5  
Structure: _ _ S _ M  
U must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
Position 5 is M, so U must be in position 1 or 2.  
C must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.  
Position 3 is S, position 5 is M, so C must be in position 1 or 2.  
- If C is in position 1: C _ S _ M  
  U must be in position 2: C U S _ M  
  The only remaining letter is B or D.  
  C U S B M → “CUSBM” invalid.  
  C U S D M → “CUSDM” invalid.  
- If C is in position 2: _ C S _ M  
  U must be in position 1: U C S _ M  
  The only remaining letter is B or D.  
  U C S B M → “UCSBM” invalid.  
  U C S D M → “UCSDM” invalid.  

After checking all possible positions, the only valid word that fits all constraints is “CUSBM” or “CUSDM”, but these are invalid. This suggests we need to try a different approach.

Let me try introducing a new letter, say D, and see if we can form a valid word.

Try structure: C U S D M → invalid.  
Try structure: U C S D M → invalid.  
Try structure: U D S C M → invalid.  
Try structure: D U S C M → invalid.  

Wait, let me try a different set of letters. Instead of C and K, we could use other unused letters. But K is already ruled out.

Actually, the only remaining unused common letters are B and D. Let me try a different word structure.

Try structure: C U D S M → invalid.  
Try structure: U C D S M → invalid.  

This seems impossible. Let me re-examine the constraints.

We have four known letters: S, M, U, C. We need one more letter. The only common unused letters are B and D. Let me try to form a valid word with these letters.

Possible valid words:
- C U S D M → invalid.  
- C U D S M → invalid.  
- U C S D M → invalid.  
- U D S C M → invalid.  

This suggests I might have missed a valid word. Let me think differently.

Actually, the word “CUSUM” is valid, but M is already in position 5, and U is in position 2. Let me check:

CUSUM:
- C (1)  
- U (2)  
- S (3)  
- U (4)  
- M (5)  

But U cannot be in position 4 (from SMUCK feedback). So this is invalid.

Another valid word: “CUSPY” – but Y is new and P is ruled out.

Another valid word: “CUSPS” – but P is ruled out.

Another valid word: “CUBUS” – but B is new, U is repeated, which is allowed.

CUBUS:
- C (1)  
- U (2)  
- B (3)  
- U (4)  
- S (5)  

Check constraints:
- S is in position 5 – allowed.  
- M is missing – invalid.  

We need M somewhere.

Another valid word: “MUSCU” – but C is in position 4, which is allowed, U in 2, S in 3, M in 1.

MUSCU:
- M (1) – allowed.  
- U (2) – allowed.  
- S (3) – allowed.  
- C (4) – allowed.  
- U (5) – allowed.  

This fits all constraints!

Let me verify:
- Letters: M, U, S, C, U.  
- S is in position 3 – allowed.  
- M is in position 1 – allowed.  
- U is in positions 2 and 5 – allowed.  
- C is in position 4 – allowed.  
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, L, P, K).  

Thus, the next logical guess is MUSCU.

From the latest feedback:

1. M(-) : M is in the word but not in position 1.  
2. U(✓) : U is in position 2 and is correct.  
3. S(✓) : S is in position 3 and is correct.  
4. C(-) : C is in the word but not in position 4.  
5. U(-) : U is in the word but not in position 5 (already known it’s in position 2).

So the word looks like: _ U S _ _  
Letters we know are present: M, C, and we already have U, S.  
Letters not present: A, R, O, E, T, I, N, G, L, P, K.

We need to place M and C in the remaining positions (1, 4, 5) with the constraints:
- M cannot be in position 1 (from MUSCU feedback).  
- C cannot be in position 4 (from SMUCK feedback).  

Possible positions for M: 4 or 5.  
Possible positions for C: 1 or 5 (since 4 is excluded for C).

Let’s consider combinations:

Case 1: M in position 4  
Then C must be in position 1 or 5.  
- If C is in position 1: C U S M _  
  The last letter must be unused and common. Remaining unused letters: B, D, F, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
  Valid word: C U S M B → “CUSMB” invalid.  
  C U S M D → “CUSMD” invalid.  
  No valid word.

- If C is in position 5: _ U S _ C

  The first letter must be unused and common.  
  Valid word: B U S M C → “BUSMC” invalid.  
  D U S M C → “DUSMC” invalid.  
  No valid word.

Case 2: M in position 5  
Then C must be in position 1 or 4.  
- If C is in position 1: C U S _ M  
  The fourth letter must be unused and common.  
  Valid word: C U S B M → “CUSBM” invalid.  
  C U S D M → “CUSDM” invalid.

  The first letter must be unused and common.  
  Valid word: B U S C M → “BUSCM” invalid.  
  D U S C M → “DUSCM” invalid.  
  No valid word.

This suggests we need to introduce a new letter. Let’s check if we missed any valid word.

Actually, let me list all valid 5-letter words fitting _ U S _ _ with letters from remaining pool (B, D, F, H, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) and containing M and C.
