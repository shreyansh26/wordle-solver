Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A balanced word that includes several of these would be ideal. 

Some good first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes 5 very common letters (R, A, I, S, E) that appear in many words, giving me good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses:

1. From RAISE:
   - Letters in word: A, S  
   - Letters NOT in word: R, I, E

2. From STAGS:
   - S is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter) – so the word ends in S.
   - A is in the word but in the wrong position (was 3rd, now it must be elsewhere).
   - T and G are NOT in the word.

So far we have:
- Word ends in S.
- Contains A (but not in 3rd position).
- Does NOT contain: R, I, E, T, G.

Remaining letters to work with include common consonants like N, L, C, D, M, P, B, H, K, etc., plus vowels O, U (since A is already used).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains A but not in the 3rd spot.  
Possible positions for A: 1st, 2nd, 4th.

Let’s brainstorm:
- _ _ A _ S → A in 3rd is invalid (was 3rd in STAGS), so A cannot be 3rd.
- _ A _ _ S → A in 2nd
- A _ _ _ S → A in 1st

Candidate words:
- _ A _ _ S:  
  – “BANAL” – ends in L, not S  
  – “CABOS” – contains O, C, B; A in 2nd, S in 5th  
  – “DAMPS” – D, A, M, P, S; A in 2nd, S in 5th  
  – “FANAL” – L at end, not S  
  – “HARAS” – R is forbidden  
  – “JAMBS” – J uncommon  
  – “LAMBS” – B is allowed, A in 2nd, S in 5th  
  – “MAMAS” – double A, but A in 2nd and 4th; S in 5th  
  – “NAMAS” – N, A, M, A, S; A in 2nd and 4th  
  – “PAPAS” – P, A, P, A, S; A in 2nd and 4th  

- A _ _ _ S:  
  – “ACARS” – C, A, R, S – but R is forbidden  
  – “ALABS” – L, A, B, S – ends in S, A in 2nd  
  – “AMASS” – A in 1st, M, A, S, S – double A, S in 5th  
  – “ANALS” – N, A, L, S – ends in S, A in 2nd  

- _ _ _ A S:  
  – “BALKS” – K is allowed, A in 4th  
  – “CABAS” – C, A, B, A, S – double A, A in 2nd and 4th  
  – “DAMAS” – D, A, M, A, S – double A, A in 2nd and 4th  
  – “FAMAS” – F, A, M, A, S – double A, A in 2nd and 4th  

Among these, “LAMBS” fits best: ends in S, contains A (2nd position, which is new), and uses only allowed letters (L, A, M, B, S).  
Another strong option is “DAMPS”: D, A, M, P, S – all allowed letters, A in 2nd, S in 5th.

I’ll choose “LAMBS” as it’s a common word and uses fresh letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A balanced word that includes several of these would be ideal. 

Some good first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes 5 very common letters (R, A, I, S, E) that appear in many words, giving me good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- I: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains A and S, but neither is in its current position.
- It does NOT contain R, I, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and S.
2. Does NOT contain R, I, or E.
3. Places A and S in different positions than before (A not 2nd, S not 4th).

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A is already used, and E/I are out).

Possible structure: _ _ _ _ _
We need to place A and S somewhere else. Let's try to use common letters.

Candidate words:
- STAND (but has N, D, T - but S is 1st, which is allowed)
- SAUNT (but U is 5th, A is 2nd - but A is not allowed in 2nd)
- STOAC (but C is less common)
- SALTY (but Y is less common)
- SPOON (but O is 3rd, A is missing)
- SLOTH (but H is 5th, A is missing)
- SATCH (but C is 5th, A is 2nd - not allowed)
- STAGS (but G is 4th, A is 3rd, S is 5th - this seems possible)

STAGS:
- S is 1st (was 4th before - allowed)
- T is 2nd (new)
- A is 3rd (was 2nd - allowed)
- G is 4th (new)
- S is 5th (was 4th - allowed)

This seems valid and uses common letters.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses:

1. From RAISE:
   - Letters in word: A, S  
   - Letters NOT in word: R, I, E

2. From STAGS:
   - S is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter) – so the word ends in S.
   - A is in the word but in the wrong position (was 3rd, now it must be elsewhere).
   - T and G are NOT in the word.

So far we have:
- Word ends in S.
- Contains A (but not in 3rd position).
- Does NOT contain: R, I, E, T, G.

Remaining letters to work with include common consonants like N, L, C, D, M, P, B, H, K, etc., plus vowels O, U (since A is already used).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains A but not in the 3rd spot.  
Possible positions for A: 1st, 2nd, 4th.

Let’s brainstorm:
- _ _ A _ S → A in 3rd is invalid (was 3rd in STAGS), so A cannot be 3rd.
- _ A _ _ S → A in 2nd
- A _ _ _ S → A in 1st

Candidate words:
- _ A _ _ S:  
  – “BANAL” – ends in L, not S  
  – “CABOS” – contains O, C, B; A in 2nd, S in 5th  
  – “DAMPS” – D, A, M, P, S; A in 2nd, S in 5th  
  – “FANAL” – L at end, not S  
  – “HARAS” – R is forbidden  
  – “JAMBS” – J uncommon  
  – “LAMBS” – B is allowed, A in 2nd, S in 5th  
  – “MAMAS” – double A, but A in 2nd and 4th; S in 5th  
  – “NAMAS” – N, A, M, A, S; A in 2nd and 4th  
  – “PAPAS” – P, A, P, A, S; A in 2nd and 4th  

- A _ _ _ S:  
  – “ACARS” – C, A, R, S – but R is forbidden  
  – “ALABS” – L, A, B, S – ends in S, A in 2nd  
  – “AMASS” – A in 1st, M, A, S, S – double A, S in 5th  
  – “ANALS” – N, A, L, S – ends in S, A in 2nd  

- _ _ _ A S:  
  – “BALKS” – K is allowed, A in 4th  
  – “CABAS” – C, A, B, A, S – double A, A in 2nd and 4th  
  – “DAMAS” – D, A, M, A, S – double A, A in 2nd and 4th  
  – “FAMAS” – F, A, M, A, S – double A, A in 2nd and 4th  

Among these, “LAMBS” fits best: ends in S, contains A (2nd position, which is new), and uses only allowed letters (L, A, M, B, S).  
Another strong option is “DAMPS”: D, A, M, P, S – all allowed letters, A in 2nd, S in 5th.

I’ll choose “LAMBS” as it’s a common word and uses fresh letters.

Let’s summarize everything we now know after three guesses.

Letters we know are NOT in the word:  
R, I, E, T, G, L, M, B

Letters we know ARE in the word and their positions:  
- S is definitely in the 5th position (✓ from STAGS and LAMBS).

Letters we know ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
- A (from RAISE and STAGS/LAMBS feedback)

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ _ S  
with A somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 3, because in STAGS A was in 3rd and marked “-” meaning wrong position).

Remaining common consonants we haven’t ruled out: N, C, D, P, H, K, F, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: O, U (since A and E/I are already handled).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains A (not in 3rd spot) and uses only allowed letters.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, or 4.

  – “ALASS” – L is forbidden  
  – “ANASS” – N, A, S, S – but we need 5 letters, and A would be 2nd, S 5th; however, this is invalid (A in 2nd, S in 5th, but we need 5 letters total).  
  – “APASS” – P, A, S, S – A in 2nd, S in 5th; but S is already 5th, so this would be 4 letters.  
  – “ASHES” – H, E, S – E is forbidden  
  – “AUSKS” – U, S, K, S – but this is 5 letters: A, U, S, K, S – S is 5th, A is 1st, but we need A somewhere in 1-4 and S in 5. This seems valid.  
  – “AUSKS” is valid: A(1), U(2), S(5) – but we have to check if S is allowed in 5th (yes) and letters are allowed (A, U, S, K). K hasn’t been ruled out yet.

  – “JAMAS” – J uncommon  
  – “KANAS” – K, A, N, A, S – A in 2nd, S in 5th. Valid.

  – “CANAS” – C, A, N, A, S – A in 3rd is invalid (from STAGS feedback)  
  – “DANAS” – D, A, N, A, S – A in 3rd invalid  
  – “FANAS” – already considered  
  – “HANAS” – H, A, N, A, S – A in 3rd invalid  
  – “KANAS” – already considered  

- _ _ _ A S:

  – “DAMAS” – M is forbidden  
  – “FANAS” – already considered  
  – “HABAS” – B is forbidden  
  – “KANAS” – already considered  

The most promising candidates are:
- AUSKS (A1, U2, S5) – but this has S in 5th and S in 4th, which is fine since S is allowed to repeat (though unlikely in a word ending in S).  
- FANAS (F1, A2, N3, A4, S5) – A is in 2nd and 4th, which is allowed.  
- KANAS (K1, A2, N3, A4, S5) – same as FANAS but K instead of F.  

Between these, “FANAS” is a valid English word (plural of fana, though rare), while “KANAS” is also valid.  
“FANAS” uses F and N which are still allowed and fits the pattern perfectly.

Therefore, I will guess FANAS.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A balanced word that includes several of these would be ideal. 

Some good first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes 5 very common letters (R, A, I, S, E) that appear in many words, giving me good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- I: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains A and S, but neither is in its current position.
- It does NOT contain R, I, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and S.
2. Does NOT contain R, I, or E.
3. Places A and S in different positions than before (A not 2nd, S not 4th).

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A is already used, and E/I are out).

Possible structure: _ _ _ _ _
We need to place A and S somewhere else. Let's try to use common letters.

Candidate words:
- STAND (but has N, D, T - but S is 1st, which is allowed)
- SAUNT (but U is 5th, A is 2nd - but A is not allowed in 2nd)
- STOAC (but C is less common)
- SALTY (but Y is less common)
- SPOON (but O is 3rd, A is missing)
- SLOTH (but H is 5th, A is missing)
- SATCH (but C is 5th, A is 2nd - not allowed)
- STAGS (but G is 4th, A is 3rd, S is 5th - this seems possible)

STAGS:
- S is 1st (was 4th before - allowed)
- T is 2nd (new)
- A is 3rd (was 2nd - allowed)
- G is 4th (new)
- S is 5th (was 4th - allowed)

This seems valid and uses common letters.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses:

1. From RAISE:
   - Letters in word: A, S  
   - Letters NOT in word: R, I, E

2. From STAGS:
   - S is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter) – so the word ends in S.
   - A is in the word but in the wrong position (was 3rd, now it must be elsewhere).
   - T and G are NOT in the word.

So far we have:
- Word ends in S.
- Contains A (but not in 3rd position).
- Does NOT contain: R, I, E, T, G.

Remaining letters to work with include common consonants like N, L, C, D, M, P, B, H, K, etc., plus vowels O, U (since A is already used).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains A but not in the 3rd spot.  
Possible positions for A: 1st, 2nd, 4th.

Let’s brainstorm:
- _ _ A _ S → A in 3rd is invalid (was 3rd in STAGS), so A cannot be 3rd.
- _ A _ _ S → A in 2nd
- A _ _ _ S → A in 1st

Candidate words:
- _ A _ _ S:  
  – “BANAL” – ends in L, not S  
  – “CABOS” – contains O, C, B; A in 2nd, S in 5th  
  – “DAMPS” – D, A, M, P, S; A in 2nd, S in 5th  
  – “FANAL” – L at end, not S  
  – “HARAS” – R is forbidden  
  – “JAMBS” – J uncommon  
  – “LAMBS” – B is allowed, A in 2nd, S in 5th  
  – “MAMAS” – double A, but A in 2nd and 4th; S in 5th  
  – “NAMAS” – N, A, M, A, S; A in 2nd and 4th  
  – “PAPAS” – P, A, P, A, S; A in 2nd and 4th  

- A _ _ _ S:  
  – “ACARS” – C, A, R, S – but R is forbidden  
  – “ALABS” – L, A, B, S – ends in S, A in 2nd  
  – “AMASS” – A in 1st, M, A, S, S – double A, S in 5th  
  – “ANALS” – N, A, L, S – ends in S, A in 2nd  

- _ _ _ A S:  
  – “BALKS” – K is allowed, A in 4th  
  – “CABAS” – C, A, B, A, S – double A, A in 2nd and 4th  
  – “DAMAS” – D, A, M, A, S – double A, A in 2nd and 4th  
  – “FAMAS” – F, A, M, A, S – double A, A in 2nd and 4th  

Among these, “LAMBS” fits best: ends in S, contains A (2nd position, which is new), and uses only allowed letters (L, A, M, B, S).  
Another strong option is “DAMPS”: D, A, M, P, S – all allowed letters, A in 2nd, S in 5th.

I’ll choose “LAMBS” as it’s a common word and uses fresh letters.

Let’s summarize everything we now know after three guesses.

Letters we know are NOT in the word:  
R, I, E, T, G, L, M, B

Letters we know ARE in the word and their positions:  
- S is definitely in the 5th position (✓ from STAGS and LAMBS).

Letters we know ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
- A (from RAISE and STAGS/LAMBS feedback)

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ _ S  
with A somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 3, because in STAGS A was in 3rd and marked “-” meaning wrong position).

Remaining common consonants we haven’t ruled out: N, C, D, P, H, K, F, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: O, U (since A and E/I are already handled).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains A (not in 3rd spot) and uses only allowed letters.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, or 4.

Candidate words:
- A _ _ _ S:  
  – “ACARS” – R is forbidden  
  – “ADAMS” – D, A, M, S – M is forbidden  
  – “AFARS” – F, A, R, S – R forbidden  
  – “ALASS” – L is forbidden  
  – “ANASS” – N, A, S, S – but we need 5 letters, and A would be 2nd, S 5th; however, this is invalid (A in 2nd, S in 5th, but we need 5 letters total).  
  – “APASS” – P, A, S, S – A in 2nd, S in 5th; but S is already 5th, so this would be 4 letters.  
  – “ASHES” – H, E, S – E is forbidden  
  – “AUSKS” – U, S, K, S – but this is 5 letters: A, U, S, K, S – S is 5th, A is 1st, but we need A somewhere in 1-4 and S in 5. This seems valid.  
  – “AUSKS” is valid: A(1), U(2), S(5) – but we have to check if S is allowed in 5th (yes) and letters are allowed (A, U, S, K). K hasn’t been ruled out yet.  

- _ A _ _ S:  
  – “CABAS” – C, A, B, A, S – B is forbidden  
  – “DAMAS” – D, A, M, A, S – M is forbidden  
  – “FANAS” – F, A, N, A, S – N is allowed, A in 2nd, S in 5th. This seems valid.  
  – “HABAS” – H, A, B, A, S – B is forbidden  
  – “JAMAS” – J uncommon  
  – “KANAS” – K, A, N, A, S – A in 2nd, S in 5th. Valid.  

- _ _ A _ S:  
  – “BANAS” – B is forbidden  
  – “CANAS” – C, A, N, A, S – A in 3rd is invalid (from STAGS feedback)  
  – “DANAS” – D, A, N, A, S – A in 3rd invalid  
  – “FANAS” – already considered  
  – “HANAS” – H, A, N, A, S – A in 3rd invalid  
  – “KANAS” – already considered  

- _ _ _ A S:  
  – “BALKS” – L is forbidden  
  – “CABAS” – B is forbidden  
  – “DAMAS” – M is forbidden  
  – “FANAS” – already considered  
  – “HABAS” – B is forbidden  
  – “KANAS” – already considered  

The most promising candidates are:
- AUSKS (A1, U2, S5) – but this has S in 5th and S in 4th, which is fine since S is allowed to repeat (though unlikely in a word ending in S).  
- FANAS (F1, A2, N3, A4, S5) – A is in 2nd and 4th, which is allowed.  
- KANAS (K1, A2, N3, A4, S5) – same as FANAS but K instead of F.  

Between these, “FANAS” is a valid English word (plural of fana, though rare), while “KANAS” is also valid.  
“FANAS” uses F and N which are still allowed and fits the pattern perfectly.

Therefore, I will guess FANAS.

Let’s update what we know after four guesses.

Letters we know are NOT in the word (×):  
R, I, E, T, G, L, M, B, F, N

Letters we know ARE in the word and their positions:  
- S is definitely in the 5th position (✓ from STAGS, LAMBS, FANAS).

Letters we know ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
- A (from RAISE, STAGS, LAMBS, FANAS feedback)

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ S  
with A somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 3, because in STAGS A was in 3rd and marked “-” meaning wrong position).

Remaining common consonants we haven’t ruled out: C, D, H, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: O, U (since A and E/I are already handled).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains A (not in 3rd spot) and uses only allowed letters.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, or 4.

Candidate words:
- A _ _ _ S:  
  – “ACARS” – R is forbidden  
  – “ADAYS” – D, A, Y, S – A in 2nd, S in 5th; but A would be 2nd, S 5th; letters allowed.  
  – “ALAYS” – L is forbidden  
  – “APAYS” – P, A, Y, S – A in 2nd, S in 5th; letters allowed.  
  – “AUSKS” – U, S, K, S – A in 1st, S in 5th; letters allowed.

The most promising candidates are:

- APAYS (A2, P3, Y4, S5) – letters allowed.  
- AUSKS (A1, U2, S4, S5) – letters allowed.  
- PAPAS (P1, A2, P3, A4, S5) – letters allowed.  

Among these, “ADAYS” and “APAYS” are valid English words, while “AUSKS” is less common and “PAPAS” repeats A.  
“ADAYS” uses D and Y which are still allowed and fits the pattern perfectly.

Therefore, I will guess ADAYS.

Among these, “ADAYS” and “APAYS” are valid English words, while “AUSKS” is less common and “PAPAS” repeats A.  
“ADAYS” uses D and Y which are still allowed and fits the pattern perfectly.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A balanced word that includes several of these would be ideal. 

Some good first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes 5 very common letters (R, A, I, S, E) that appear in many words, giving me good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- I: not in the word (x)
- S: in the word but wrong position (-)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains A and S, but neither is in its current position.
- It does NOT contain R, I, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and S.
2. Does NOT contain R, I, or E.
3. Places A and S in different positions than before (A not 2nd, S not 4th).

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A is already used, and E/I are out).

Possible structure: _ _ _ _ _
We need to place A and S somewhere else. Let's try to use common letters.

Candidate words:
- STAND (but has N, D, T - but S is 1st, which is allowed)
- SAUNT (but U is 5th, A is 2nd - but A is not allowed in 2nd)
- STOAC (but C is less common)
- SALTY (but Y is less common)
- SPOON (but O is 3rd, A is missing)
- SLOTH (but H is 5th, A is missing)
- SATCH (but C is 5th, A is 2nd - not allowed)
- STAGS (but G is 4th, A is 3rd, S is 5th - this seems possible)

STAGS:
- S is 1st (was 4th before - allowed)
- T is 2nd (new)
- A is 3rd (was 2nd - allowed)
- G is 4th (new)
- S is 5th (was 4th - allowed)

This seems valid and uses common letters.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses:

1. From RAISE:
   - Letters in word: A, S  
   - Letters NOT in word: R, I, E

2. From STAGS:
   - S is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter) – so the word ends in S.
   - A is in the word but in the wrong position (was 3rd, now it must be elsewhere).
   - T and G are NOT in the word.

So far we have:
- Word ends in S.
- Contains A (but not in 3rd position).
- Does NOT contain: R, I, E, T, G.

Remaining letters to work with include common consonants like N, L, C, D, M, P, B, H, K, etc., plus vowels O, U (since A is already used).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains A but not in the 3rd spot.  
Possible positions for A: 1st, 2nd, 4th.

Let’s brainstorm:
- _ _ A _ S → A in 3rd is invalid (was 3rd in STAGS), so A cannot be 3rd.
- _ A _ _ S → A in 2nd
- A _ _ _ S → A in 1st

Candidate words:
- _ A _ _ S:  
  – “BANAL” – ends in L, not S  
  – “CABOS” – contains O, C, B; A in 2nd, S in 5th  
  – “DAMPS” – D, A, M, P, S; A in 2nd, S in 5th  
  – “FANAL” – L at end, not S  
  – “HARAS” – R is forbidden  
  – “JAMBS” – J uncommon  
  – “LAMBS” – B is allowed, A in 2nd, S in 5th  
  – “MAMAS” – double A, but A in 2nd and 4th; S in 5th  
  – “NAMAS” – N, A, M, A, S; A in 2nd and 4th  
  – “PAPAS” – P, A, P, A, S; A in 2nd and 4th  

- A _ _ _ S:  
  – “ACARS” – C, A, R, S – but R is forbidden  
  – “ALABS” – L, A, B, S – ends in S, A in 2nd  
  – “AMASS” – A in 1st, M, A, S, S – double A, S in 5th  
  – “ANALS” – N, A, L, S – ends in S, A in 2nd  

- _ _ _ A S:  
  – “BALKS” – K is allowed, A in 4th  
  – “CABAS” – C, A, B, A, S – double A, A in 2nd and 4th  
  – “DAMAS” – D, A, M, A, S – double A, A in 2nd and 4th  
  – “FAMAS” – F, A, M, A, S – double A, A in 2nd and 4th  

Among these, “LAMBS” fits best: ends in S, contains A (2nd position, which is new), and uses only allowed letters (L, A, M, B, S).  
Another strong option is “DAMPS”: D, A, M, P, S – all allowed letters, A in 2nd, S in 5th.

I’ll choose “LAMBS” as it’s a common word and uses fresh letters.

Let’s summarize everything we now know after three guesses.

Letters we know are NOT in the word:  
R, I, E, T, G, L, M, B

Letters we know ARE in the word and their positions:  
- S is definitely in the 5th position (✓ from STAGS and LAMBS).

Letters we know ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
- A (from RAISE and STAGS/LAMBS feedback)

So the pattern so far is: _ _ _ _ S  
with A somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 3, because in STAGS A was in 3rd and marked “-” meaning wrong position).

Remaining common consonants we haven’t ruled out: N, C, D, P, H, K, F, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: O, U (since A and E/I are already handled).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains A (not in 3rd spot) and uses only allowed letters.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, or 4.

Candidate words:
- A _ _ _ S:  
  – “ACARS” – R is forbidden  
  – “ADAMS” – D, A, M, S – M is forbidden  
  – “AFARS” – F, A, R, S – R forbidden  
  – “ALASS” – L is forbidden  
  – “ANASS” – N, A, S, S – but we need 5 letters, and A would be 2nd, S 5th; however, this is invalid (A in 2nd, S in 5th, but we need 5 letters total).  
  – “APASS” – P, A, S, S – A in 2nd, S in 5th; but S is already 5th, so this would be 4 letters.  
  – “ASHES” – H, E, S – E is forbidden  
  – “AUSKS” – U, S, K, S – but this is 5 letters: A, U, S, K, S – S is 5th, A is 1st, but we need A somewhere in 1-4 and S in 5. This seems valid.  
  – “AUSKS” is valid: A(1), U(2), S(5) – but we have to check if S is allowed in 5th (yes) and letters are allowed (A, U, S, K). K hasn’t been ruled out yet.  

- _ A _ _ S:  
  – “CABAS” – C, A, B, A, S – B is forbidden  
  – “DAMAS” – D, A, M, A, S – M is forbidden  
  – “FANAS” – F, A, N, A, S – N is allowed, A in 2nd, S in 5th. This seems valid.  
  – “HABAS” – H, A, B, A, S – B is forbidden  
  – “JAMAS” – J uncommon  
  – “KANAS” – K, A, N, A, S – A in 2nd, S in 5th. Valid.  

- _ _ A _ S:  
  – “BANAS” – B is forbidden  
  – “CANAS” – C, A, N, A, S – A in 3rd is invalid (from STAGS feedback)  
  – “DANAS” – D, A, N, A, S – A in 3rd invalid  
  – “FANAS” – already considered  
  – “HANAS” – H, A, N, A, S – A in 3rd invalid  
  – “KANAS” – already considered  

- _ _ _ A S:  
  – “BALKS” – L is forbidden  
  – “CABAS” – B is forbidden  
  – “DAMAS” – M is forbidden  
  – “FANAS” – already considered  
  – “HABAS” – B is forbidden  
  – “KANAS” – already considered  

The most promising candidates are:
- AUSKS (A1, U2, S5) – but this has S in 5th and S in 4th, which is fine since S is allowed to repeat (though unlikely in a word ending in S).  
- FANAS (F1, A2, N3, A4, S5) – A is in 2nd and 4th, which is allowed.  
- KANAS (K1, A2, N3, A4, S5) – same as FANAS but K instead of F.  

Between these, “FANAS” is a valid English word (plural of fana, though rare), while “KANAS” is also valid.  
“FANAS” uses F and N which are still allowed and fits the pattern perfectly.

Therefore, I will guess FANAS.

Let’s update what we know after four guesses.

Letters we know are NOT in the word (×):  
R, I, E, T, G, L, M, B, F, N

Letters we know ARE in the word and their positions:  
- S is definitely in the 5th position (✓ from STAGS, LAMBS, FANAS).

Letters we know ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:  
- A (from RAISE, STAGS, LAMBS, FANAS feedback)

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ S  
with A somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not 3, because in STAGS A was in 3rd and marked “-” meaning wrong position).

Remaining common consonants we haven’t ruled out: C, D, H, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: O, U (since A and E/I are already handled).

We need a 5-letter word ending in S that contains A (not in 3rd spot) and uses only allowed letters.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, or 4.

Candidate words:
- A _ _ _ S:  
  – “ACARS” – R is forbidden  
  – “ADAYS” – D, A, Y, S – A in 2nd, S in 5th; but A would be 2nd, S 5th; letters allowed.  
  – “ALAYS” – L is forbidden  
  – “APAYS” – P, A, Y, S – A in 2nd, S in 5th; letters allowed.  
  – “AUSKS” – U, S, K, S – A in 1st, S in 5th; letters allowed.

  – “DAMAS” – M is forbidden  
  – “HABAS” – B is forbidden  
  – “KABAS” – B is forbidden  
  – “PAPAS” – already considered  

The most promising candidates are:
- ADAYS (A2, D3, Y4, S5) – letters allowed.  
- APAYS (A2, P3, Y4, S5) – letters allowed.  
- AUSKS (A1, U2, S4, S5) – letters allowed.  
- PAPAS (P1, A2, P3, A4, S5) – letters allowed.  

Among these, “ADAYS” and “APAYS” are valid English words, while “AUSKS” is less common and “PAPAS” repeats A.  
“ADAYS” uses D and Y which are still allowed and fits the pattern perfectly.

Therefore, I will guess ADAYS.

From the latest feedback on ADAYS:
- A(✓) in position 1 → A is fixed at the start.
- S(✓) in position 5 → S is fixed at the end.
- D(x) and Y(x) → D and Y are not in the word at all.

So the pattern is now:
A _ _ _ S

Letters we know are NOT in the word (×):  
R, I, E, T, G, L, M, B, F, N, D, Y

Letters we know ARE in the word:  
A (position 1), S (position 5)

Remaining common consonants still allowed: C, H, K, P, V, W, etc.
Remaining vowels still allowed: O, U (since A is already used).

We need a 5-letter word that starts with A, ends with S, and uses only the still-allowed letters in positions 2, 3, 4.

Possible letters for positions 2, 3, 4: C, H, K, P, V, W, O, U.

We also know from earlier feedback that A cannot be in position 3 (from STAGS feedback). However, since A is already fixed in position 1, this is irrelevant now.

Let’s think of common 5-letter words that fit A _ _ _ S:
- ACARS – R is forbidden
- ACKAS – K, C, A, S – but A is already fixed in 1, and we’d have A twice, which might be possible, but let’s check
- ACHOS – H, C, O – but this is 5 letters: A C H O S
- AKCAS – K, C, A, S – again A twice
- AHOYS – H, O, Y – Y is forbidden
- APHAS – P, H, A, S – A is already in 1, so this would be A P H A S – but A is already in 1, and we don’t know about double A yet
- AVAST – V, A, S, T – T is forbidden
- AWACS – W, A, C, S – A is in 1, so A W A C S – but A is already in 1, and we don’t know if double A is allowed
- ACHOS – A C H O S – letters allowed: A, C, H, O, S – none of C, H, O are forbidden, and none of the forbidden letters are used.

Let’s verify ACHOS:
- Starts with A (✓ position 1)
- Ends with S (✓ position 5)
- Letters: A, C, H, O, S – none of C, H, O are in the forbidden list.
- No forbidden letters D, Y, etc.

This seems valid.

Another candidate: ACHOS is a valid word (a type of aircraft or a variant of “achoo”). Let’s go with that.
