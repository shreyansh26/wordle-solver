For the first guess, we want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses these letters without repeating any. 

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it covers five of the most common letters and has no duplicates, giving us maximum information about the secret word's composition.

From the feedback on ARISE:
- A, R, I are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere, but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, I.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S and E (each at least once).
2. Does NOT have A, R, I.
3. S is not in position 4.
4. E is not in position 5.

Possible candidates:
- STOLE (S in 1, E in 4) – but E is in 4, which is allowed.
- STONE (S in 1, E in 4) – same issue.
- STEPS (S in 1, E in 3) – but S appears twice, and we don’t know if S is unique.
- STOLE: S in 1, E in 4 – satisfies all constraints.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x): A, R, I, L  
Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions (-): S, E, T, O  

So the secret word must contain each of S, E, T, O exactly once (since we have four distinct letters marked “in word but wrong place”), and it must be five letters long. Therefore the fifth letter must be one we haven’t tried yet and must not be any of A, R, I, L.

Remaining unused common consonants: N, D, C, M, P, H, etc.  
Remaining unused vowels: U (since E is already confirmed, and A, I are out).

Let’s list possible 5-letter words using the four known letters plus one new letter, ensuring:
- S, E, T, O appear once each.
- The new letter is not A, R, I, L.

A quick mental scan yields:
- “O” must be in a new position (it was in position 3 in STOLE, so it can’t be 3).
- “T” must be in a new position (it was in position 2 in STOLE, so it can’t be 2).
- “S” must be in a new position (it was in position 1 in STOLE, so it can’t be 1).
- “E” must be in a new position (it was in position 5 in STOLE, so it can’t be 5).

Let’s try to place them:
- Position 1: Can’t be S → possible T, O, new letter.
- Position 2: Can’t be T → possible S, O, new letter.
- Position 3: Can’t be O → possible S, T, E, new letter.
- Position 4: Any of S, T, E, O, new letter.
- Position 5: Can’t be E → possible S, T, O, new letter.

A valid arrangement that satisfies all constraints is:
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: new letter (must be one we haven’t used, say N)

This gives the word “TOESN” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Let’s rearrange:
- Position 1: E (allowed, wasn’t in position 1 before)
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: N

This gives “ETONS” – also not a word.

Another valid English word that fits the constraints is “OCEAN” – but A is already excluded.

Another candidate: “TONES”
- T (position 1) – allowed (wasn’t in 1 before)
- O (position 2) – allowed (wasn’t in 2 before)
- N (new letter)
- E (position 4) – allowed (wasn’t in 4 before)

So the secret word must contain each of S, E, T, O exactly once (since we have four distinct letters marked “in word but wrong place”), and it must be five letters long. Therefore the fifth letter must be one we haven’t tried yet and must not be any of A, R, I, L.

Remaining unused common consonants: N, D, C, M, P, H, etc.  
Remaining unused vowels: U (since E is already confirmed, and A, I are out).

Let’s list possible 5-letter words using the four known letters plus one new letter, ensuring:
- S, E, T, O appear once each.
- The new letter is not A, R, I, L.

A quick mental scan yields:
- “O” must be in a new position (it was in position 3 in STOLE, so it can’t be 3).
- “T” must be in a new position (it was in position 2 in STOLE, so it can’t be 2).
- “S” must be in a new position (it was in position 1 in STOLE, so it can’t be 1).
- “E” must be in a new position (it was in position 5 in STOLE, so it can’t be 5).

Let’s try to place them:
- Position 1: Can’t be S → possible T, O, new letter.
- Position 2: Can’t be T → possible S, O, new letter.
- Position 3: Can’t be O → possible S, T, E, new letter.
- Position 4: Any of S, T, E, O, new letter.
- Position 5: Can’t be E → possible S, T, O, new letter.

A valid arrangement that satisfies all constraints is:
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: new letter (must be one we haven’t used, say N)

This gives the word “TOESN” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Let’s rearrange:
- Position 1: E (allowed, wasn’t in position 1 before)
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: N

This gives “ETONS” – also not a word.

Another valid English word that fits the constraints is “OCEAN” – but A is already excluded.

Another candidate: “TONES”
- T (position 1) – allowed (wasn’t in 1 before)
- O (position 2) – allowed (wasn’t in 2 before)
- N (new letter)
- E (position 4) – allowed (wasn’t in 4 before)
- S (position 5) – allowed (wasn’t in 5 before)

“TONES” is a valid English word and satisfies all constraints.

From the feedback on TONES:

- O is in the correct position (position 2).
- N is NOT in the word.
- E is in the correct position (position 4).
- S is in the correct position (position 5).

T O _ E S

The only missing letter is the third position. From previous feedback we know:
- The word must contain S, E, T, O (each exactly once).
- It must NOT contain A, R, I, L, N.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses these letters without repeating any. 

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it covers five of the most common letters and has no duplicates, giving us maximum information about the secret word's composition.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A, R, I are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere, but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, I.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S and E (each at least once).
2. Does NOT have A, R, I.
3. S is not in position 4.
4. E is not in position 5.

Possible candidates:
- STOLE (S in 1, E in 4) – but E is in 4, which is allowed.
- STONE (S in 1, E in 4) – same issue.
- STEPS (S in 1, E in 3) – but S appears twice, and we don’t know if S is unique.
- STOLE: S in 1, E in 4 – satisfies all constraints.
- STEIN: E in 3 – satisfies all constraints.
- STEPS: S in 1, E in 3 – satisfies all constraints.
- STEWS: S in 1, E in 3 – but no E at all, so invalid.
- STOLE seems best.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x): A, R, I, L  
Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions (-): S, E, T, O  

So the secret word must contain each of S, E, T, O exactly once (since we have four distinct letters marked “in word but wrong place”), and it must be five letters long. Therefore the fifth letter must be one we haven’t tried yet and must not be any of A, R, I, L.

Remaining unused common consonants: N, D, C, M, P, H, etc.  
Remaining unused vowels: U (since E is already confirmed, and A, I are out).

Let’s list possible 5-letter words using the four known letters plus one new letter, ensuring:
- S, E, T, O appear once each.
- The new letter is not A, R, I, L.

A quick mental scan yields:
- “O” must be in a new position (it was in position 3 in STOLE, so it can’t be 3).
- “T” must be in a new position (it was in position 2 in STOLE, so it can’t be 2).
- “S” must be in a new position (it was in position 1 in STOLE, so it can’t be 1).
- “E” must be in a new position (it was in position 5 in STOLE, so it can’t be 5).

Let’s try to place them:
- Position 1: Can’t be S → possible T, O, new letter.
- Position 2: Can’t be T → possible S, O, new letter.
- Position 3: Can’t be O → possible S, T, E, new letter.
- Position 4: Any of S, T, E, O, new letter.
- Position 5: Can’t be E → possible S, T, O, new letter.

A valid arrangement that satisfies all constraints is:
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: new letter (must be one we haven’t used, say N)

This gives the word “TOESN” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Let’s rearrange:
- Position 1: E (allowed, wasn’t in position 1 before)
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: N

This gives “ETONS” – also not a word.

Another valid English word that fits the constraints is “OCEAN” – but A is already excluded.

Another candidate: “TONES”
- T (position 1) – allowed (wasn’t in 1 before)
- O (position 2) – allowed (wasn’t in 2 before)
- N (new letter)
- E (position 4) – allowed (wasn’t in 4 before)
- S (position 5) – allowed (wasn’t in 5 before)

“TONES” is a valid English word and satisfies all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses these letters without repeating any. 

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""ARISE"" as it covers five of the most common letters and has no duplicates, giving us maximum information about the secret word's composition.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A, R, I are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere, but NOT in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, I.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S and E (each at least once).
2. Does NOT have A, R, I.
3. S is not in position 4.
4. E is not in position 5.

Possible candidates:
- STOLE (S in 1, E in 4) – but E is in 4, which is allowed.
- STONE (S in 1, E in 4) – same issue.
- STEPS (S in 1, E in 3) – but S appears twice, and we don’t know if S is unique.
- STOLE: S in 1, E in 4 – satisfies all constraints.
- STEIN: E in 3 – satisfies all constraints.
- STEPS: S in 1, E in 3 – satisfies all constraints.
- STEWS: S in 1, E in 3 – but no E at all, so invalid.
- STOLE seems best.

Let’s go with STOLE.

<|im_end|>

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x): A, R, I, L  
Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions (-): S, E, T, O  

So the secret word must contain each of S, E, T, O exactly once (since we have four distinct letters marked “in word but wrong place”), and it must be five letters long. Therefore the fifth letter must be one we haven’t tried yet and must not be any of A, R, I, L.

Remaining unused common consonants: N, D, C, M, P, H, etc.  
Remaining unused vowels: U (since E is already confirmed, and A, I are out).

Let’s list possible 5-letter words using the four known letters plus one new letter, ensuring:
- S, E, T, O appear once each.
- The new letter is not A, R, I, L.

A quick mental scan yields:
- “O” must be in a new position (it was in position 3 in STOLE, so it can’t be 3).
- “T” must be in a new position (it was in position 2 in STOLE, so it can’t be 2).
- “S” must be in a new position (it was in position 1 in STOLE, so it can’t be 1).
- “E” must be in a new position (it was in position 5 in STOLE, so it can’t be 5).

Let’s try to place them:
- Position 1: Can’t be S → possible T, O, new letter.
- Position 2: Can’t be T → possible S, O, new letter.
- Position 3: Can’t be O → possible S, T, E, new letter.
- Position 4: Any of S, T, E, O, new letter.
- Position 5: Can’t be E → possible S, T, O, new letter.

A valid arrangement that satisfies all constraints is:
- Position 1: T
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: new letter (must be one we haven’t used, say N)

This gives the word “TOESN” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Let’s rearrange:
- Position 1: E (allowed, wasn’t in position 1 before)
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: N

This gives “ETONS” – also not a word.

Another valid English word that fits the constraints is “OCEAN” – but A is already excluded.

Another candidate: “TONES”
- T (position 1) – allowed (wasn’t in 1 before)
- O (position 2) – allowed (wasn’t in 2 before)
- N (new letter)
- E (position 4) – allowed (wasn’t in 4 before)
- S (position 5) – allowed (wasn’t in 5 before)

“TONES” is a valid English word and satisfies all constraints.

Let’s go with TONES.

Guess 3: TONES -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) O(✓) N(x) E(✓) S(✓)

From the feedback on TONES:
- T is in the correct position (position 1).
- O is in the correct position (position 2).
- N is NOT in the word.
- E is in the correct position (position 4).
- S is in the correct position (position 5).

So the secret word is now known to be:
T O _ E S

The only missing letter is the third position. From previous feedback we know:
- The word must contain S, E, T, O (each exactly once).
- It must NOT contain A, R, I, L, N.
- Therefore the third letter must be one of the remaining unused letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter English words that fit T O _ E S:
- T O B E S – “TOBES” is not a valid English word.
- T O C E S – “TOCES” is not valid.
- T O D E S – “TODES” is not valid.
- T O F E S – “TOFES” is not valid.
- T O G E S – “TOGES” is valid (plural of toga).
- T O H E S – “TOHES” is not valid.
- T O K E S – “TOKES” is valid (past tense of “toke”).
- T O M E S – “TOMES” is valid (plural of tome).
- T O P E S – “TOPES” is not valid.
- T O Q E S – “TOQES” is not valid.
- T O R E S – “TORIES” is 6 letters, but “TORS” is 4 letters.
- T O S E S – “TOSES” is not valid.
- T O U E S – “TOUES” is not valid.

- T O W E S – “TOWES” is not valid.
- T O X E S – “TOXES” is not valid.
- T O Y E S – “TOYES” is not valid.

The valid options among these are:
