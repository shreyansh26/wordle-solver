### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and covers as many vowels and consonants as possible. Some popular choices include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - covering common consonants and vowels.
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - another strong set.
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - which includes two vowels (A, O) and three common consonants.

""AROSE"" seems slightly better because it includes the very common vowel 'O' and the consonants R and S, which are frequent in 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage to eliminate or confirm many letters in subsequent guesses.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – A, R, O are all in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.  
   – S and E are not in the word at all.

2. ROACH → R(-) O(-) A(-) C(x) H(x)  
   – R is still in the word but not in position 1.  
   – O is still in the word but not in position 2.  
   – A is still in the word but not in position 3.  
   – C and H are not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, O  
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, E, C, H  
- Position constraints:  
  – A ≠ 1, 3  
  – R ≠ 2, 1  
  – O ≠ 3, 2  

We still need to place A, R, O and introduce two new letters that are not yet ruled out (i.e., not S, E, C, H).

Possible remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels left to test: I, U (since A, O are already confirmed and E is out).

A good next guess should:
- Use A, R, O in new positions.  
- Introduce two new letters that are common and haven’t been tested yet.

Let’s try “TROOP”:
- T and P are new letters.  
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since R was only excluded from 1 and 2).  
- O is in position 3 (but O was excluded from 3 in guess 1). ❌ Invalid.

Try “GROAN”:
- G and N are new letters.  
- G in 1 (allowed), R in 2 (allowed), O in 3 (excluded) ❌ Invalid.

Try “GRAIL”:
- G, I, L are new letters.  
- R in 2 (allowed), A in 3 (excluded) ❌ Invalid.

Try “MORAL”:

- M in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (excluded) ❌ Invalid.

Try “BROIL”:

Try “TROOP” again – no, O in 3 is excluded.

Try “GRAIL” – A in 3 is excluded.

Let’s systematically list possible positions for A, R, O:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Known: A ≠ 1,3; R ≠ 1,2; O ≠ 2,3.

Possible placements:
- A can be in 2,4,5  
- R can be in 3,4,5  
- O can be in 1,4,5  

We need to pick a word that satisfies these and introduces two new letters.

Let’s try “RADIO”:

“ROADY”:
- R in 1 (excluded) ❌

“ROARY”:

“OARLY”:

  This seems valid.

Check constraints:

Looking at these options:
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - covering common consonants and vowels.
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - another strong set.
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - which includes two vowels (A, O) and three common consonants.

""AROSE"" seems slightly better because it includes the very common vowel 'O' and the consonants R and S, which are frequent in 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage to eliminate or confirm many letters in subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters to include: A, R, O (but not in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively).
- Letters to exclude: S, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that contains A, R, O in different positions and avoids S and E. Possible positions:
- A cannot be in slot 1.
- R cannot be in slot 2.
- O cannot be in slot 3.

A good next guess should test new letters while repositioning the known ones. Let's try ""ROACH"":
- R in slot 1 (allowed, since R was only excluded from slot 2).
- O in slot 2 (allowed, since O was only excluded from slot 3).
- A in slot 3 (allowed, since A was only excluded from slot 1).
- C and H are new letters to test.

This should give us information on C and H while repositioning A, R, O.

Guess 2: ROACH -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) A(-) C(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – A, R, O are all in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.  
   – S and E are not in the word at all.

2. ROACH → R(-) O(-) A(-) C(x) H(x)  
   – R is still in the word but not in position 1.  
   – O is still in the word but not in position 2.  
   – A is still in the word but not in position 3.  
   – C and H are not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, O  
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, E, C, H  
- Position constraints:  
  – A ≠ 1, 3  
  – R ≠ 2, 1  
  – O ≠ 3, 2  

We still need to place A, R, O and introduce two new letters that are not yet ruled out (i.e., not S, E, C, H).

Possible remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels left to test: I, U (since A, O are already confirmed and E is out).

A good next guess should:
- Use A, R, O in new positions.  
- Introduce two new letters that are common and haven’t been tested yet.

Let’s try “TROOP”:
- T and P are new letters.  
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since R was only excluded from 1 and 2).  
- O is in position 3 (but O was excluded from 3 in guess 1). ❌ Invalid.

Try “GROAN”:
- G and N are new letters.  
- G in 1 (allowed), R in 2 (allowed), O in 3 (excluded) ❌ Invalid.

Try “GRAIL”:
- G, I, L are new letters.  
- R in 2 (allowed), A in 3 (excluded) ❌ Invalid.

Try “MORAL”:
- M and L are new letters.  
- M in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (excluded) ❌ Invalid.

Try “BROIL”:
- B and L are new letters.  
- B in 1 (allowed), R in 2 (excluded) ❌ Invalid.

Try “DRAIL”:
- D and L are new letters.  
- D in 1 (allowed), R in 2 (excluded) ❌ Invalid.

Try “FRANK”:
- F and N, K are new letters.  
- F in 1 (allowed), R in 2 (excluded) ❌ Invalid.

Try “TRIAD”:
- T and D are new letters.  
- T in 1 (allowed), R in 2 (excluded) ❌ Invalid.

Try “WORRY”:
- W and Y are new letters.  
- W in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (excluded) ❌ Invalid.

Try “TROOP” again – no, O in 3 is excluded.

Try “GRAIL” – A in 3 is excluded.

Let’s systematically list possible positions for A, R, O:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Known: A ≠ 1,3; R ≠ 1,2; O ≠ 2,3.

Possible placements:
- A can be in 2,4,5  
- R can be in 3,4,5  
- O can be in 1,4,5  

We need to pick a word that satisfies these and introduces two new letters.

Let’s try “RADIO”:
- R in 1 (excluded) ❌

“ROADY”:
- R in 1 (excluded) ❌

“ROARY”:
- R in 1 (excluded) ❌

“OARLY”:
- O in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed), L and Y new.  
  This seems valid.

Check constraints:
- O in 1 (allowed)  
- A in 2 (allowed)  
- R in 3 (allowed)  
- L and Y are new letters.

This fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, we want to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and covers as many vowels and consonants as possible. Some popular choices include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - covering common consonants and vowels.
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - another strong set.
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - which includes two vowels (A, O) and three common consonants.

""AROSE"" seems slightly better because it includes the very common vowel 'O' and the consonants R and S, which are frequent in 5-letter words. This should give us good coverage to eliminate or confirm many letters in subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters to include: A, R, O (but not in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively).
- Letters to exclude: S, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that contains A, R, O in different positions and avoids S and E. Possible positions:
- A cannot be in slot 1.
- R cannot be in slot 2.
- O cannot be in slot 3.

A good next guess should test new letters while repositioning the known ones. Let's try ""ROACH"":
- R in slot 1 (allowed, since R was only excluded from slot 2).
- O in slot 2 (allowed, since O was only excluded from slot 3).
- A in slot 3 (allowed, since A was only excluded from slot 1).
- C and H are new letters to test.

This should give us information on C and H while repositioning A, R, O.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – A, R, O are all in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively.  
   – S and E are not in the word at all.

2. ROACH → R(-) O(-) A(-) C(x) H(x)  
   – R is still in the word but not in position 1.  
   – O is still in the word but not in position 2.  
   – A is still in the word but not in position 3.  
   – C and H are not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, O  
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, E, C, H  
- Position constraints:  
  – A ≠ 1, 3  
  – R ≠ 2, 1  
  – O ≠ 3, 2  

We still need to place A, R, O and introduce two new letters that are not yet ruled out (i.e., not S, E, C, H).

Possible remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels left to test: I, U (since A, O are already confirmed and E is out).

A good next guess should:
- Use A, R, O in new positions.  
- Introduce two new letters that are common and haven’t been tested yet.

Let’s try “TROOP”:
- T and P are new letters.  
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since R was only excluded from 1 and 2).  
- O is in position 3 (but O was excluded from 3 in guess 1). ❌ Invalid.

Try “GROAN”:
- G and N are new letters.  
- G in 1 (allowed), R in 2 (allowed), O in 3 (excluded) ❌ Invalid.

Try “GRAIL”:
- G, I, L are new letters.  
- R in 2 (allowed), A in 3 (excluded) ❌ Invalid.

Try “MORAL”:
- M and L are new letters.  
- M in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (excluded) ❌ Invalid.

Try “BROIL”:
- B and L are new letters.  
- B in 1 (allowed), R in 2 (excluded) ❌ Invalid.

Try “DRAIL”:
- D and L are new letters.  
- D in 1 (allowed), R in 2 (excluded) ❌ Invalid.

Try “FRANK”:
- F and N, K are new letters.  
- F in 1 (allowed), R in 2 (excluded) ❌ Invalid.

Try “TRIAD”:
- T and D are new letters.  
- T in 1 (allowed), R in 2 (excluded) ❌ Invalid.

Try “WORRY”:
- W and Y are new letters.  
- W in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (excluded) ❌ Invalid.

Try “TROOP” again – no, O in 3 is excluded.

Try “GRAIL” – A in 3 is excluded.

Let’s systematically list possible positions for A, R, O:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5  
Known: A ≠ 1,3; R ≠ 1,2; O ≠ 2,3.

Possible placements:
- A can be in 2,4,5  
- R can be in 3,4,5  
- O can be in 1,4,5  

We need to pick a word that satisfies these and introduces two new letters.

Let’s try “RADIO”:
- R in 1 (excluded) ❌

“ROADY”:
- R in 1 (excluded) ❌

“ROARY”:
- R in 1 (excluded) ❌

“OARLY”:
- O in 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed), L and Y new.  
  This seems valid.

Check constraints:
- O in 1 (allowed)  
- A in 2 (allowed)  
- R in 3 (allowed)  
- L and Y are new letters.

This fits all constraints.
