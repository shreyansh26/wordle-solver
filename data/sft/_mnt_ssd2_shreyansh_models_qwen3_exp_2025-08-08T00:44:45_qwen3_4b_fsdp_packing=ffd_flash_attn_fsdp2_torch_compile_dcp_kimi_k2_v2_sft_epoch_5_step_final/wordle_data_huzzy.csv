For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use a mix of these letters without repeating any. 

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it covers R, A, I, S, E - five of the most common letters in English, giving us good coverage for identifying which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

All five letters in RAISE (R, A, I, S, E) are marked “x”, which means none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates the most common letters in English and leaves us with the remaining alphabet to work with.

Next step: pick a word that uses letters we haven’t tried yet and still covers common remaining consonants and vowels.  
Good candidates:  
- LUNCH (L, U, N, C, H)  
- MOUNT (M, O, U, N, T)  
- PLUMB (P, L, U, M, B)  
- DOUGH (D, O, U, G, H)  

Among these, “MOUNT” uses M, O, U, N, T — five high-frequency letters still untested.  
It balances consonants (M, N, T) and the vowel O, plus the semi-common vowel U, making it a strong second guess.

- Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, A, I, S, E, M, O, N, T, D, C, K
- Letters we know ARE in the word: U (correctly placed in position 2) and Y (somewhere in the word, but not in position 5)

- PULPY (but P, L, Y are allowed, but P is repeated which might not be optimal)
- GUMMY (but M is ruled out)
- LUMPY (but M is ruled out)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use a mix of these letters without repeating any. 

Some excellent starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it covers R, A, I, S, E - five of the most common letters in English, giving us good coverage for identifying which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in RAISE (R, A, I, S, E) are marked “x”, which means none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates the most common letters in English and leaves us with the remaining alphabet to work with.

Next step: pick a word that uses letters we haven’t tried yet and still covers common remaining consonants and vowels.  
Good candidates:  
- LUNCH (L, U, N, C, H)  
- MOUNT (M, O, U, N, T)  
- PLUMB (P, L, U, M, B)  
- DOUGH (D, O, U, G, H)  

Among these, “MOUNT” uses M, O, U, N, T — five high-frequency letters still untested.  
It balances consonants (M, N, T) and the vowel O, plus the semi-common vowel U, making it a strong second guess.

From the two guesses we have:

- Letters ruled out completely: R, A, I, S, E, M, O, N, T  
- Letters we know are in the word but in the wrong place: U (it was in position 3 in MOUNT, so it must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter U (but not in position 3)
2. Uses only letters not yet eliminated (so no R, A, I, S, E, M, O, N, T)
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information gain

Remaining common letters: D, L, C, G, H, K, P, B, F, Y, W, V, etc.

A good candidate is “DUCKY”:
- Contains U (in position 2, so it’s not in position 3, satisfying the feedback)
- Uses D, U, C, K, Y — all letters are still possible
- Includes two new consonants (D, C, K) and a new vowel (Y, which acts as a vowel)

Another candidate is “FUGLY” (but Y is less common), so “DUCKY” is better.

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it covers R, A, I, S, E - five of the most common letters in English, giving us good coverage for identifying which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in RAISE (R, A, I, S, E) are marked “x”, which means none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates the most common letters in English and leaves us with the remaining alphabet to work with.

Next step: pick a word that uses letters we haven’t tried yet and still covers common remaining consonants and vowels.  
Good candidates:  
- LUNCH (L, U, N, C, H)  
- MOUNT (M, O, U, N, T)  
- PLUMB (P, L, U, M, B)  
- DOUGH (D, O, U, G, H)  

Among these, “MOUNT” uses M, O, U, N, T — five high-frequency letters still untested.  
It balances consonants (M, N, T) and the vowel O, plus the semi-common vowel U, making it a strong second guess.

Guess 2: MOUNT -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) U(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

- Letters ruled out completely: R, A, I, S, E, M, O, N, T  
- Letters we know are in the word but in the wrong place: U (it was in position 3 in MOUNT, so it must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter U (but not in position 3)
2. Uses only letters not yet eliminated (so no R, A, I, S, E, M, O, N, T)
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information gain

Remaining common letters: D, L, C, G, H, K, P, B, F, Y, W, V, etc.

A good candidate is “DUCKY”:
- Contains U (in position 2, so it’s not in position 3, satisfying the feedback)
- Uses D, U, C, K, Y — all letters are still possible
- Includes two new consonants (D, C, K) and a new vowel (Y, which acts as a vowel)

Another candidate is “FUGLY” (but Y is less common), so “DUCKY” is better.

Let’s go with “DUCKY”.

Guess 3: DUCKY -> FEEDBACK: D(x) U(✓) C(x) K(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

- Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, A, I, S, E, M, O, N, T, D, C, K
- Letters we know ARE in the word: U (correctly placed in position 2) and Y (somewhere in the word, but not in position 5)
- Therefore the secret word looks like: _ U _ _ _ with Y somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Remaining unused common letters: B, F, G, H, L, P, V, W, X, Z, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has U in position 2.
2. Contains Y (in position 1, 3, or 4).
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible patterns:
- Y U _ _ _
- _ U Y _ _
- _ U _ Y _

Let’s try to find a common word that fits these constraints. The most straightforward is _ U Y _ _, such as:
- BUYER (but E is ruled out)
- HUMID (but M, I, D are ruled out)
- PULPY (but P, L, Y are allowed, but P is repeated which might not be optimal)
- GUMMY (but M is ruled out)
- LUMPY (but M is ruled out)
- BUYON (but N is ruled out)

Looking at the remaining letters, ""BUYON"" is invalid because N is out. Let me think differently: maybe Y is in position 1 or 4.

Another approach: Y U _ _ _:
- YUGAL (not a valid word)
- YULIA (not valid, A is out)
- YUKES (E is out)
- YUGAL (invalid)

_ U Y _ _:
- BULGY (B, U, L, G, Y) – all letters are still possible, and it’s a valid word.
- PULPY (P, U, L, P, Y) – but P is repeated, which might not be ideal.
- GULPY (not a common word)

""BULGY"" seems the best fit: B, U, L, G, Y. All letters are still allowed, and it uses common remaining letters.

Let’s go with BULGY.

From the new feedback:

- B(x) – B is NOT in the word  
- U(✓) – U is in position 2 (fixed)  
- L(x) – L is NOT in the word  
- G(x) – G is NOT in the word  
- Y(✓) – Y is in the word, but NOT in position 5  

So the pattern so far is:  
_ U _ _ Y  (Y must be in position 5)

Letters already ruled out:  
R, A, I, S, E, M, O, N, T, D, C, K, B, L, G

Remaining unused common letters: F, H, P, V, W, Z, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Has U in position 2.  
2. Has Y in position 5.  
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Possible patterns:  
_ U _ _ Y

Let’s list common words fitting this pattern:
- FURY? (only 4 letters)  
- HUMID? (M, I, D out)  
- PUFFY (F, P, U, F, Y – but F is repeated)  
- PULPY (L out)  
- WUMPY (M out)  
- VULPY (L out)  
- HUMPY (M out)  
- FUMPY (M out)  
- HUZZY (Z is allowed, but not common)  

The only common valid word left is PUFFY, despite the double F.  
It uses P and F, both still allowed, and fits the pattern _ U _ _ Y.

Let’s go with PUFFY.
