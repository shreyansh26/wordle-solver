For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - good for vowels)
- ROATE (contains R, O, A, T, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down the secret word quickly.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓)
- L, A, T are not in the word at all (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
1. The word starts with S
2. It does NOT contain L, A, or T
3. It does contain E, but not in the 5th position

We need a 5-letter word starting with S that:
- Does NOT have L, A, or T
- Has E somewhere in positions 2-4

Good letters to test next might be R, N, I, O, C, etc. A word like ""SIREN"" fits:
- Starts with S
- Doesn't have L, A, or T
- Has E in position 3
- Uses common remaining letters (R, I, N)

Another option could be ""SHIRE"" but H is less common. ""SIREN"" seems like a strong next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - good for vowels)
- ROATE (contains R, O, A, T, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down the secret word quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓)
- L, A, T are not in the word at all (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
1. The word starts with S
2. It does NOT contain L, A, or T
3. It does contain E, but not in the 5th position

We need a 5-letter word starting with S that:
- Does NOT have L, A, or T
- Has E somewhere in positions 2-4

Good letters to test next might be R, N, I, O, C, etc. A word like ""SIREN"" fits:
- Starts with S
- Doesn't have L, A, or T
- Has E in position 3
- Uses common remaining letters (R, I, N)

Another option could be ""SHIRE"" but H is less common. ""SIREN"" seems like a strong next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
   - Word starts with S
   - Does NOT contain L, A, T
   - Contains E, but not at position 5

2. SIREN → S(✓) I(x) R(✓) E(-) N(x)
   - S is still correct at position 1
   - I and N are NOT in the word
   - R is correct at position 3
   - E is in the word but not at position 4

So far we know:
- Pattern: S _ R _ _
- Letters to exclude: L, A, T, I, N
- Letters to include: S, R, E (with E not at 4 or 5)
- E must be in position 2.

Therefore the pattern is now: S E R _ _

Remaining letters to fill positions 4 and 5 must not be any of the excluded letters (L, A, T, I, N) and must be from the remaining alphabet. Common letters left include C, D, M, O, U, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- SERUM
- SERCO
- SERMO
- SERVO
- SERED (but D is common)
- SERUM seems the most common English word fitting this pattern.

Let's check:
- S E R U M
- No L, A, T, I, N
- E is in position 2 (allowed)
- R is in position 3 (matches ✓)
- S is in position 1 (matches ✓)

This seems valid.

3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it includes:

   - Does NOT contain L, A, T
   - Contains E, but not at position 5

2. SIREN → S(✓) I(x) R(✓) E(-) N(x)
   - S is still correct at position 1
   - I and N are NOT in the word
   - R is correct at position 3
   - E is in the word but not at position 4

So far we know:
- Pattern: S _ R _ _
- Letters to exclude: L, A, T, I, N
- Letters to include: S, R, E (with E not at 4 or 5)
- E must be in position 2.

Therefore the pattern is now: S E R _ _

Remaining letters to fill positions 4 and 5 must not be any of the excluded letters (L, A, T, I, N) and must be from the remaining alphabet. Common letters left include C, D, M, O, U, Y, etc.

Possible words:
- SERUM
- SERCO
- SERMO
- SERVO
- SERED (but D is common)
- SERUM seems the most common English word fitting this pattern.

Let's check:
- S E R U M
- No L, A, T, I, N
- E is in position 2 (allowed)
- R is in position 3 (matches ✓)
- S is in position 1 (matches ✓)

This seems valid.

2. SIREN → S(✓) I(x) R(✓) E(-) N(x)
3. SERUM → S(✓) E(✓) R(✓) U(x) M(x)

What we know for sure:
- The word is S E R _ _
- Letters already excluded: L, A, T, I, N, U, M
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. Common English 5-letter words that fit S E R _ _ and use only the allowed letters are:

- SERED (but D is allowed, E is already used)
- SERGE (but G is allowed, E is already used)
- SERFS (but F is allowed, S is already used)
- SERED is not a valid word.
- SERGE is a valid word (a fabric)
- SERFS is a valid word (plural of serf)

Between these, ""SERGE"" is more common.

Let's check:
- S E R G E
- No excluded letters
- Fits the pattern

From all feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)  
   - Word starts with S, contains E (not at position 5)

2. SIREN → S(✓) I(x) R(✓) E(-) N(x)  
   - R is in position 3, E is in word but not at 4

3. SERUM → S(✓) E(✓) R(✓) U(x) M(x)  
   - E is now in position 2, R in 3, S in 1

4. SERGE → S(✓) E(✓) R(✓) G(x) E(-)  
   - G is not in word, E is in word but not at 5 (already known)

Current pattern: S E R _ _

Letters excluded: L, A, T, I, N, U, M, G  
Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two letters for positions 4 and 5, using only the allowed set. The only common English word that fits is:

S E R F S → but S is already used in position 1 and cannot appear again (since letters are distinct in standard Wordle rules).

Next common word: S E R V E → but E is already in position 2 and cannot appear again.

Next: S E R V O → uses V and O, both allowed.

Check SERVO:
- S E R V O
- No excluded letters
- Fits the pattern

Therefore, the next logical guess is SERVO.

We need two distinct letters from this set to fill positions 4 and 5.

- SERF_ : none
- SERH_ : none
- SERK_ : none
- SERP_ : SERP_ → SERP_ (none)
- SERX_ : none

- SERZ_ : none

The only valid word left is:

SERBS

Check:
- S E R B S
- S is already in position 1, so B and S are allowed (S can repeat in Wordle rules).
- Letters used: S, E, R, B, S – none are in the excluded list.
- Fits the pattern S E R _ _

Therefore, the only remaining candidate is SERBS.
