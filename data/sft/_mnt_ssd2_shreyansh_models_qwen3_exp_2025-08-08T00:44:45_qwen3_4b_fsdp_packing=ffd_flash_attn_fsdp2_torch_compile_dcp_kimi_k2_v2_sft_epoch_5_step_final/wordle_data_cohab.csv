2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters and covers different vowels and consonants. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular starting words include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is correct in position 1 (✓).
- R is not in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- N and E are not in the word (x).

So the secret word looks like: C _ _ _ _

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s try a word that places A in a different position and uses common remaining letters. A good candidate is “CLOUD”:
- Starts with C
- Contains A (but we don’t have an A in CLOUD, so this is bad). Oops, let’s pick a word with A.

How about “CABOT”:
- Starts with C
- Contains A in position 2
- Uses common letters B, O, T
- Does not contain R, N, E

This should give us more information about A’s position and other letters.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters and covers different vowels and consonants. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular starting words include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"". 

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give us good coverage to identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is correct in position 1 (✓).
- R is not in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- N and E are not in the word (x).

So the secret word looks like: C _ _ _ _
Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, N, E
Letters we know are in the word: C (position 1), A (somewhere else)

We need a word that:
1. Starts with C
2. Contains A (but not in position 3)
3. Does NOT contain R, N, or E

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s try a word that places A in a different position and uses common remaining letters. A good candidate is “CLOUD”:
- Starts with C
- Contains A (but we don’t have an A in CLOUD, so this is bad). Oops, let’s pick a word with A.

How about “CABOT”:
- Starts with C
- Contains A in position 2
- Uses common letters B, O, T
- Does not contain R, N, E

This should give us more information about A’s position and other letters.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. CRANE → C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   - Word starts with C.
   - Letters NOT in the word: R, N, E.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. CABOT → C(✓) A(-) B(-) O(-) T(x)
   - A is still in the word but now we know it’s not in position 2 either.
   - B, O are in the word but in wrong positions.
   - T is not in the word.

Current constraints:
- First letter: C
- A is somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5 (but position 1 is already C).
- B, O are somewhere in the word, but not in positions 2, 4, 5 respectively.
- Letters NOT in the word: R, N, E, T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with C
- Contains A, B, O
- Does NOT contain R, N, E, T
- A is in position 4 or 5
- B is not in position 2
- O is not in position 4

Possible positions:
C _ _ _ _  
A must be in 4 or 5 → C _ _ A _ or C _ _ _ A

B must be in 1, 3, or 5 → but 1 is C, so 3 or 5
O must be in 1, 2, or 3 → 1 is C, so 2 or 3

Let’s try:
- C _ O B A → positions: C(1), O(3), B(4), A(5)
  - Check constraints: A is in 5 (allowed), B is in 4 (allowed), O is in 3 (allowed). No forbidden letters. Valid word: COBRA – but R is forbidden. So invalid.

- C _ B O A → positions: C(1), B(3), O(4), A(5)
  - Check: A in 5, B in 3, O in 4. All constraints met. Word: CBOOA – not valid.

- C B O A _ → positions: C(1), B(2), O(3), A(4)
  - B in 2 is forbidden (from CABOT feedback, B is in wrong position, which was 3 in CABOT, so 2 is allowed? Wait, CABOT had B in 3 with (-), so B is in word but not in 3. So B can be in 2, 4, 5. So this is allowed. Word: CBOA_ – need a 5th letter. CBOAD – not valid. CBOAK – not valid. CBOAL – not valid. CBOAM – not valid. CBOAP – not valid. CBOAQ – not valid. CBOAR – R forbidden. CBOAS – S is allowed. CBOAS is valid (CBOAS – not a common word). 

- C A B O _ – A in 2 is forbidden (from CABOT, A was in 2 with (-)). 

- C O B A _ – O in 2, B in 3, A in 4. Word: COB_A – COBAD – not valid. COBAK – not valid. COBAL – not valid. COBAM – not valid. COBAP – not valid. COBAQ – not valid. COBAR – R forbidden. COBAS – COBAS is valid (short for COBAS, but may not be common). 

- C O A B _ – A in 3 is allowed (from CRANE, A was in 3 with (-), so 3 is allowed). Word: COAB_ – COABD – not valid. COABK – not valid. COABL – not valid. COABM – not valid. COABP – not valid. COABQ – not valid. COABR – R forbidden. COABS – COABS is valid (short for COABS, but uncommon). 

- C A O B _ – A in 2 is forbidden. 

- C _ A O B – A in 3, O in 4, B in 5. Word: C_AOB – CDOAB – not valid. CMOAB – not valid. CVOAB – not valid. CVOAB – not valid. 

- C _ A B O – A in 3, B in 4, O in 5. Word: C_A_B_O – CDOAB – not valid. CMOAB – not valid. CVOAB – not valid. 

Let’s try a different approach: list possible words that start with C, contain A, B, O, and fit constraints.

Possible words:
- COBRA – R forbidden.
- COBIA – C O B I A – I is allowed, but we know B must be in word. COBIA has B in 3, A in 5. Check constraints:
  - C(1) ✓
  - A in 5 (allowed)
  - B in 3 (allowed, since in CABOT B was in 3 with (-), so 3 is allowed)
  - O in 2 (allowed, since in CABOT O was in 4 with (-), so 2 is allowed)
  - Letters: C, O, B, I, A – none of R, N, E, T. Valid word.

COBIA seems to fit all constraints.

From all feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)

Current constraints:
- Word structure: C O _ _ _
- Letters known to be in the word: A, B (and O, C already placed).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, N, E, T, I.
- A must be in position 4 (since it cannot be in 2, 3, or 5 and positions 1,2 are taken by C,O).
- B must be in position 3 or 4, but position 4 is A, so B must be in position 3.

Thus the word must be: C O B A _

Now we need a 5th letter that:
- Is not any of R, N, E, T, I.
- Common consonants left: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible candidates:
- COBAS (but S is allowed, though uncommon)
- COBAD (D is allowed)
- COBAK (K is allowed)
- COBAL (L is allowed)
- COBAM (M is allowed)
- COBAP (P is allowed)

Among these, COBAD is a valid English word (a type of fish), so let's try that.

  - C(1) ✓
  - A in 5 (allowed)
  - B in 3 (allowed, since in CABOT B was in 3 with (-), so 3 is allowed)
  - O in 2 (allowed, since in CABOT O was in 4 with (-), so 2 is allowed)
  - Letters: C, O, B, I, A – none of R, N, E, T. Valid word.

COBIA seems to fit all constraints.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CABOT -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(-) B(-) O(-) T(x)
Guess 3: COBIA -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(✓) B(-) I(x) A(-)

From all feedback so far:

1. CRANE → C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   - C is fixed at position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, or 5.
   - R, N, E are not in the word.

2. CABOT → C(✓) A(-) B(-) O(-) T(x)
   - A is not in position 2 (already known).
   - B is in the word but not in position 3.
   - O is in the word but not in position 4.
   - T is not in the word.

3. COBIA → C(✓) O(✓) B(-) I(x) A(-)
   - C(1) and O(2) are fixed.
   - B is in the word but not in position 3 (already known).
   - I is not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 5 (already known).

Current constraints:
- Word structure: C O _ _ _
- Letters known to be in the word: A, B (and O, C already placed).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, N, E, T, I.
- A must be in position 4 (since it cannot be in 2, 3, or 5 and positions 1,2 are taken by C,O).
- B must be in position 3 or 4, but position 4 is A, so B must be in position 3.

Thus the word must be: C O B A _

Now we need a 5th letter that:
- Is not any of R, N, E, T, I.
- Common consonants left: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible candidates:
- COBAS (but S is allowed, though uncommon)
- COBAD (D is allowed)
- COBAK (K is allowed)
- COBAL (L is allowed)
- COBAM (M is allowed)
- COBAP (P is allowed)

Among these, COBAD is a valid English word (a type of fish), so let's try that.
