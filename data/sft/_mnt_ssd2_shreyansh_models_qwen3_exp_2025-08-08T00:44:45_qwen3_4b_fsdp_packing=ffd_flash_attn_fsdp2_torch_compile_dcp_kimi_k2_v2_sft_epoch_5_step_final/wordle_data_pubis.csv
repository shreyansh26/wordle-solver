Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" because it contains S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better because it covers more vowel positions.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it balances vowels and consonants well and uses very common letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
- DOES contain S, but S is NOT in position 4.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (but not in position 4).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

Good letters to include next: common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc., and vowels like I, U.

Possible candidates:
- STING (but has S in position 1, which is allowed, and no forbidden letters)
- STUMP (S in position 1, no forbidden letters)
- SLING (S in position 1, no forbidden letters)
- STINT (S in position 1, no forbidden letters)

""STING"" seems good - it uses S in position 1, and includes common letters T, I, N, G.

So far we know:

- I is in the word but not in position 3

Remaining possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5
Remaining possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4, 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and I
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, T, N, G
- S is not in position 1 or 4
- I is not in position 3

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

I think ""ISKUM"" is the only possible word left, even though it's uncommon. Let's go with that.

<guess>ISKUM</guess>
</think>

Given the constraints:
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, T, N, G
- S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4
- I is in the word but not in position 3

The only remaining common word that fits these constraints is ""ISKUM"" (though it's not very common). However, since we need a valid 5-letter word, I'll choose ""ISKUM"" as the next guess.

<guess>ISKUM</guess>",ISKUM,"So far we know:
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, T, N, G
- S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4
- I is in the word but not in position 3

Remaining possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5
Remaining possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4, 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and I
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, T, N, G
- S is not in position 1 or 4
- I is not in position 3

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let's look for common combinations:
- S in position 2: _ S _ _ _
- S in position 3: _ _ S _ _
- S in position 5: _ _ _ _ S

I must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" because it contains S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better because it covers more vowel positions.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it balances vowels and consonants well and uses very common letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
- DOES contain S, but S is NOT in position 4.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (but not in position 4).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

Good letters to include next: common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc., and vowels like I, U.

Possible candidates:
- STING (but has S in position 1, which is allowed, and no forbidden letters)
- STUMP (S in position 1, no forbidden letters)
- SLING (S in position 1, no forbidden letters)
- STINT (S in position 1, no forbidden letters)

""STING"" seems good - it uses S in position 1, and includes common letters T, I, N, G.

So far we know:
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, T, N, G
- S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4
- I is in the word but not in position 3

Remaining possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5
Remaining possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4, 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and I
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, T, N, G
- S is not in position 1 or 4
- I is not in position 3

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

This is really challenging. Maybe I should try ""S"" in position 5 and ""I"" in position 4: _ _ _ I S
Possible: _ _ _ I S
Need common words:
B _ _ I S - no
C _ _ I S - no

J _ _ I S - no

U _ _ I S - no
V _ _ I S - no
W _ _ I S - no
X _ _ I S - no
Y _ _ I S - no
Z _ _ I S - no

I think ""ISKUM"" is the only possible word left, even though it's uncommon. Let's go with that.

<guess>ISKUM</guess>Given the constraints:
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, T, N, G
- S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4
- I is in the word but not in position 3

The only remaining common word that fits these constraints is ""ISKUM"" (though it's not very common). However, since we need a valid 5-letter word, I'll choose ""ISKUM"" as the next guess.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STING → S(-) T(x) I(-) N(x) G(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.

3. ISKUM → I(-) S(-) K(x) U(-) M(x)
   - I is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 2.
   - U is in the word but not in position 4.

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, E, T, N, G, K, M.

Known letters that must appear: S, I, U.

Positions ruled out:
- S cannot be in 1, 2, 4.
- I cannot be in 1, 3.
- U cannot be in 4.

Therefore:
- S must be in position 3 or 5.
- I must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- U must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Let’s list possible patterns:

Case 1: S in position 3
   Pattern: _ _ S _ _
   Then:
   - I must be in 2, 4, or 5.
   - U must be in 1, 2, or 3 (but 3 is S), so U must be in 1 or 2.
   Possible sub-patterns:
   - U I S _ _  (I in 2, U in 1)
   - I U S _ _  (I in 2, U in 1 is same as above)
   - _ I S U _  (I in 2, U in 4 – but U cannot be in 4)
   - _ U S I _  (U in 2, I in 4)
   - _ U S _ I  (U in 2, I in 5)
   - U _ S I _  (U in 1, I in 4)
   - U _ S _ I  (U in 1, I in 5)

Case 2: S in position 5
   Pattern: _ _ _ _ S
   Then:
   - I must be in 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is S), so I in 2 or 4.
   - U must be in 1, 2, or 3.
   Possible sub-patterns:
   - U I _ _ S  (I in 2, U in 1)
   - I U _ _ S  (I in 2, U in 1 is same as above)
   - _ U I _ S  (U in 2, I in 3 – but I cannot be in 3)
   - _ I U _ S  (I in 2, U in 3)
   - _ U _ I S  (I in 4, U in 2)
   - _ _ U I S  (I in 4, U in 3)
   - _ I _ U S  (I in 2, U in 4 – but U cannot be in 4)

From these, the valid patterns are:

1. U I S _ _  (U in 1, I in 2, S in 3)
2. _ U S I _  (U in 2, S in 3, I in 4)
3. _ U S _ I  (U in 2, S in 3, I in 5)
4. _ I U _ S  (I in 2, U in 3, S in 5)
5. _ U _ I S  (U in 2, I in 4, S in 5)
6. _ _ U I S  (U in 3, I in 4, S in 5)

Now, we need to find common 5-letter words that fit these patterns and use only allowed letters (no A, R, O, E, T, N, G, K, M).

Looking at pattern 1: U I S _ _
   Need two more letters in positions 4 and 5, from allowed letters (B, C, D, F, H, J, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).
   Possible word: ""UIST_"" – not common.

Pattern 2: _ U S I _
   Need first and last letters. Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, H, J, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   Possible word: ""BUSID"" – invalid (D is allowed, but not common).
   ""FUSIL"" – but L is allowed, but ""FUSIL"" is valid.

Pattern 3: _ U S _ I
   Need first and fourth letters. ""B"" and ""D"" are allowed.
   ""BUSDI"" – invalid.
   ""FUSDI"" – invalid.

Pattern 4: _ I U _ S
   Need first and fourth letters. ""B"" and ""D"" are allowed.
   ""BIU_S"" – not common.

Pattern 5: _ U _ I S
   Need first and third letters. ""B"" and ""D"" are allowed.
   ""BU_D_S"" – ""BU_D_S"" → ""BUDIS"" – invalid.
   ""FUDIS"" – invalid.

Pattern 6: _ _ U I S
   Need first two letters. ""B"" and ""D"" are allowed.
   ""BUIS_"" – ""BUIS_"" → ""BUIS_"" – not common.
   ""FUIS_"" – invalid.

The most promising seems pattern 2: _ U S I _
   The word ""FUSIL"" fits (F, U, S, I, L), all letters allowed and positions correct.

Let's verify:
- F: allowed
- U: allowed (in position 2)
- S: allowed (in position 3)
- I: allowed (in position 4)
- L: allowed

This seems valid.

</think>

Based on the feedback, the only remaining common word that fits all constraints is ""FUSIL"".

<guess>FUSIL</guess>",FUSIL,"From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STING → S(-) T(x) I(-) N(x) G(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.

3. ISKUM → I(-) S(-) K(x) U(-) M(x)
   - I is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 2.
   - U is in the word but not in position 4.

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, E, T, N, G, K, M.

Known letters that must appear: S, I, U.

Positions ruled out:
- S cannot be in 1, 2, 4.
- I cannot be in 1, 3.
- U cannot be in 4.

Therefore:
- S must be in position 3 or 5.
- I must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- U must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Let’s list possible patterns:

Case 1: S in position 3
   Pattern: _ _ S _ _
   Then:
   - I must be in 2, 4, or 5.
   - U must be in 1, 2, or 3 (but 3 is S), so U must be in 1 or 2.
   Possible sub-patterns:
   - U I S _ _  (I in 2, U in 1)
   - I U S _ _  (I in 2, U in 1 is same as above)
   - _ I S U _  (I in 2, U in 4 – but U cannot be in 4)
   - _ U S I _  (U in 2, I in 4)
   - _ U S _ I  (U in 2, I in 5)
   - U _ S I _  (U in 1, I in 4)
   - U _ S _ I  (U in 1, I in 5)

Case 2: S in position 5
   Pattern: _ _ _ _ S
   Then:
   - I must be in 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is S), so I in 2 or 4.
   - U must be in 1, 2, or 3.
   Possible sub-patterns:
   - U I _ _ S  (I in 2, U in 1)
   - I U _ _ S  (I in 2, U in 1 is same as above)
   - _ U I _ S  (U in 2, I in 3 – but I cannot be in 3)
   - _ I U _ S  (I in 2, U in 3)
   - _ U _ I S  (I in 4, U in 2)
   - _ _ U I S  (I in 4, U in 3)
   - _ I _ U S  (I in 2, U in 4 – but U cannot be in 4)

From these, the valid patterns are:

1. U I S _ _  (U in 1, I in 2, S in 3)
2. _ U S I _  (U in 2, S in 3, I in 4)
3. _ U S _ I  (U in 2, S in 3, I in 5)
4. _ I U _ S  (I in 2, U in 3, S in 5)
5. _ U _ I S  (U in 2, I in 4, S in 5)
6. _ _ U I S  (U in 3, I in 4, S in 5)

Now, we need to find common 5-letter words that fit these patterns and use only allowed letters (no A, R, O, E, T, N, G, K, M).

Looking at pattern 1: U I S _ _
   Need two more letters in positions 4 and 5, from allowed letters (B, C, D, F, H, J, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).
   Possible word: ""UIST_"" – not common.

Pattern 2: _ U S I _
   Need first and last letters. Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, H, J, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   Possible word: ""BUSID"" – invalid (D is allowed, but not common).
   ""FUSIL"" – but L is allowed, but ""FUSIL"" is valid.

Pattern 3: _ U S _ I

   ""BUSDI"" – invalid.
   ""FUSDI"" – invalid.

Pattern 4: _ I U _ S

   ""FUIS_"" – invalid.

The most promising seems pattern 2: _ U S I _
   The word ""FUSIL"" fits (F, U, S, I, L), all letters allowed and positions correct.

Let's verify:
- F: allowed
- U: allowed (in position 2)
- S: allowed (in position 3)
- I: allowed (in position 4)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring consonants and vowels. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" because it contains S, L, A, T, E - which are all very common letters. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better because it covers more vowel positions.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it balances vowels and consonants well and uses very common letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.
- DOES contain S, but S is NOT in position 4.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S (but not in position 4).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

Good letters to include next: common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc., and vowels like I, U.

Possible candidates:
- STING (but has S in position 1, which is allowed, and no forbidden letters)
- STUMP (S in position 1, no forbidden letters)
- SLING (S in position 1, no forbidden letters)
- STINT (S in position 1, no forbidden letters)

""STING"" seems good - it uses S in position 1, and includes common letters T, I, N, G.

So far we know:
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, T, N, G
- S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4
- I is in the word but not in position 3

Remaining possible positions for S: 2, 3, 5
Remaining possible positions for I: 1, 2, 4, 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains S and I
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E, T, N, G
- S is not in position 1 or 4
- I is not in position 3

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let's look for common combinations:
- S in position 2: _ S _ _ _
- S in position 3: _ _ S _ _
- S in position 5: _ _ _ _ S

I must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

I think ""ISKUM"" is the only possible word left, even though it's uncommon. Let's go with that.

<guess>ISKUM</guess>Given the constraints:
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, E, T, N, G
- S is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4
- I is in the word but not in position 3

The only remaining common word that fits these constraints is ""ISKUM"" (though it's not very common). However, since we need a valid 5-letter word, I'll choose ""ISKUM"" as the next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: STING -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) I(-) N(x) G(x)
Guess 3: ISKUM -> FEEDBACK: I(-) S(-) K(x) U(-) M(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 4.

2. STING → S(-) T(x) I(-) N(x) G(x)
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.

3. ISKUM → I(-) S(-) K(x) U(-) M(x)
   - I is in the word but not in position 1.
   - S is in the word but not in position 2.
   - U is in the word but not in position 4.

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, E, T, N, G, K, M.

Known letters that must appear: S, I, U.

Positions ruled out:
- S cannot be in 1, 2, 4.
- I cannot be in 1, 3.
- U cannot be in 4.

Therefore:
- S must be in position 3 or 5.
- I must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- U must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Let’s list possible patterns:

Case 1: S in position 3
   Pattern: _ _ S _ _
   Then:
   - I must be in 2, 4, or 5.
   - U must be in 1, 2, or 3 (but 3 is S), so U must be in 1 or 2.
   Possible sub-patterns:
   - U I S _ _  (I in 2, U in 1)
   - I U S _ _  (I in 2, U in 1 is same as above)
   - _ I S U _  (I in 2, U in 4 – but U cannot be in 4)
   - _ U S I _  (U in 2, I in 4)
   - _ U S _ I  (U in 2, I in 5)
   - U _ S I _  (U in 1, I in 4)
   - U _ S _ I  (U in 1, I in 5)

Case 2: S in position 5
   Pattern: _ _ _ _ S
   Then:
   - I must be in 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is S), so I in 2 or 4.
   - U must be in 1, 2, or 3.
   Possible sub-patterns:
   - U I _ _ S  (I in 2, U in 1)
   - I U _ _ S  (I in 2, U in 1 is same as above)
   - _ U I _ S  (U in 2, I in 3 – but I cannot be in 3)
   - _ I U _ S  (I in 2, U in 3)
   - _ U _ I S  (I in 4, U in 2)
   - _ _ U I S  (I in 4, U in 3)
   - _ I _ U S  (I in 2, U in 4 – but U cannot be in 4)

From these, the valid patterns are:

1. U I S _ _  (U in 1, I in 2, S in 3)
2. _ U S I _  (U in 2, S in 3, I in 4)
3. _ U S _ I  (U in 2, S in 3, I in 5)
4. _ I U _ S  (I in 2, U in 3, S in 5)
5. _ U _ I S  (U in 2, I in 4, S in 5)
6. _ _ U I S  (U in 3, I in 4, S in 5)

Now, we need to find common 5-letter words that fit these patterns and use only allowed letters (no A, R, O, E, T, N, G, K, M).

Looking at pattern 1: U I S _ _
   Need two more letters in positions 4 and 5, from allowed letters (B, C, D, F, H, J, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).
   Possible word: ""UIST_"" – not common.

Pattern 2: _ U S I _
   Need first and last letters. Allowed letters: B, C, D, F, H, J, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   Possible word: ""BUSID"" – invalid (D is allowed, but not common).
   ""FUSIL"" – but L is allowed, but ""FUSIL"" is valid.

Pattern 3: _ U S _ I
   Need first and fourth letters. ""B"" and ""D"" are allowed.
   ""BUSDI"" – invalid.
   ""FUSDI"" – invalid.

Pattern 4: _ I U _ S
   Need first and fourth letters. ""B"" and ""D"" are allowed.
   ""BIU_S"" – not common.

Pattern 5: _ U _ I S
   Need first and third letters. ""B"" and ""D"" are allowed.
   ""BU_D_S"" – ""BU_D_S"" → ""BUDIS"" – invalid.
   ""FUDIS"" – invalid.

Pattern 6: _ _ U I S
   Need first two letters. ""B"" and ""D"" are allowed.
   ""BUIS_"" – ""BUIS_"" → ""BUIS_"" – not common.
   ""FUIS_"" – invalid.

The most promising seems pattern 2: _ U S I _
   The word ""FUSIL"" fits (F, U, S, I, L), all letters allowed and positions correct.

Let's verify:
- F: allowed
- U: allowed (in position 2)
- S: allowed (in position 3)
- I: allowed (in position 4)
- L: allowed

This seems valid.Based on the feedback, the only remaining common word that fits all constraints is ""FUSIL"".

From the latest feedback:

FUSIL → F(x) U(✓) S(-) I(✓) L(x)

- U is in the correct position (position 2).
- I is in the correct position (position 4).
- S is in the word but not in position 3.
- F and L are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: U (position 2), I (position 4), S (somewhere except 1,2,3,5).
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, T, N, G, K, M, F, L.
- Allowed positions for S: only position 3 is still open for S, but feedback says S is not in position 3. Wait, let me re-examine:

Looking back:
- S cannot be in positions 1,2,3,4,5? No, let's re-express the constraints:

From all feedback:
1. S cannot be in positions 1,2,4 (from STING and ISKUM)
2. S cannot be in position 3 (from FUSIL feedback)
3. S cannot be in position 5 (from ISKUM feedback? No, ISKUM had S in position 2 and it was -, meaning S is not in position 2. So S is not in 1,2,3,4,5? That can't be. Wait:

Let me re-express all position constraints for S:

- AROSE: S(-) → S not in position 4
- STING: S(-) → S not in position 1
- ISKUM: S(-) → S not in position 2
- FUSIL: S(-) → S not in position 3

So S is NOT in positions 1,2,3,4. The only remaining position is 5. Therefore S must be in position 5.

So the word has the form: _ U _ I S

Now we need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters not yet ruled out. Forbidden letters include: A, R, O, E, T, N, G, K, M, F, L.

Allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: B, C, D, H, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common 5-letter word that fits _ U _ I S.

Possible candidates:
- B U D I S → ""BUDIS"" – not a word
- C U B I S → ""CUBIS"" – not a word
- C U D I S → ""CUDIS"" – not a word
- H U B I S → ""HUBIS"" – not a word
- J U B I S → ""JUBIS"" – not a word
- P U B I S → ""PUBIS"" – valid word (plural of pubis)

""PUBIS"" fits:
- P: allowed
- U: position 2 (correct)

This seems to be the only common word left that fits all constraints.
