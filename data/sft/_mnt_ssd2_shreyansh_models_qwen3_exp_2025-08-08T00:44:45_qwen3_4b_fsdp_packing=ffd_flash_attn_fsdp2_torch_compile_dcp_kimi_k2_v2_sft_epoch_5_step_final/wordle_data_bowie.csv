For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters and covers a broad range of vowels and consonants. This helps eliminate many possibilities early on.

Common starting words include:
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- A, E (common vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)
- O (another vowel)
This gives good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
- E is in the word AND in position 5 (✓).

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains an O somewhere other than the 3rd position.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing O (not in position 3), and avoiding A, R, S.

- _ _ O _ E
- _ O _ _ E
- O _ _ _ E

Let's pick a word that fits these constraints and uses common remaining letters. ""POINT"" is out (has I and T, but we don't know about I yet). ""HOVEL"" has H, O, V, E, L - but V is less common. ""CLOVE"" has C, L, O, V, E - again V is less common. ""HOPE"" is 4 letters. ""GLOVE"" has G, L, O, V, E - still V. ""MONEY"" has M, O, N, E, Y - this looks good: M, O, N, E, Y.

Possible patterns:
- _ O _ _ E
- We can try common combinations like B, C, D, F, G, H, L, P, T, V, W with vowels I or U.

Let's pick a word that fits these constraints and uses common remaining letters. ""POINT"" is out (has I and T, but we don't know about I yet). ""HOVEL"" has H, O, V, E, L - but V is less common. ""CLOVE"" has C, L, O, V, E - again V is less common. ""HOPE"" is 4 letters. ""GLOVE"" has G, L, O, V, E - still V. ""MONEY"" has M, O, N, E, Y - this looks good: M, O, N, E, Y. It ends in E, has O (position 2), and avoids A, R, S.

Let's try ""MONEY"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: MONEY -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is in position 5 (✓)
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)
   - A, R, S are not in the word

2. MONEY → M(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)
   - O is in position 2 (✓)
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-)
   - M, N, Y are not in the word

Combining both:
- Word ends with E (position 5)
- O is in position 2
- Letters not in the word: A, R, S, M, N, Y
- So far we have: _ O _ _ E

We need three more letters (positions 1, 3, 4) that are not A, R, S, M, N, Y. Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, P, T, V, W, etc. Vowels left: I, U (since O and E are used).

Possible patterns:
- _ O _ _ E
- We can try common combinations like B, C, D, F, G, H, L, P, T, V, W with vowels I or U.

Let's think of words:
- B O O B E (invalid, repeats B)
- C O B E E (invalid)
- D O L E E (invalid)
- F O O D E (invalid)
- G O O D E (invalid)
- H O O K E (invalid)
- P O O L E (invalid)
- T O O L E (invalid)
- W O O D E (invalid)

Wait, we need to avoid A, R, S, M, N, Y. So letters allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z, etc.

Looking for valid 5-letter words ending in E with O in position 2 and avoiding forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- B O I L E
- C O B B E (invalid)
- D O I L E
- F O I L E
- G O I L E
- H O I L E
- P O I L E
- T O I L E
- V O I L E
- W O I L E

Among these, ""HOILE"" is not a valid word. ""DOILE"" is not valid. ""FOILE"" is not valid. ""GOILE"" is not valid. ""POILE"" is not valid. ""TOILE"" is a valid word (a type of fabric).

Let's check:
- T O I L E
  - T, O, I, L, E
  - O is in position 2 (✓)
  - E is in position 5 (✓)
  - Letters used: T, O, I, L, E
  - Forbidden letters: A, R, S, M, N, Y - none of these are used.
  - This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""COILE"" is not valid. ""BOILE"" is not valid. ""VOILE"" is valid (a type of fabric).

Between ""TOILE"" and ""VOILE"", both are valid. ""TOILE"" seems more common.

Let's go with ""TOILE"".

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - A, R, S are not in the word.

2. MONEY → M(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)
   - O is fixed in position 2.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (already known, since it’s in position 5).
   - M, N, Y are not in the word.

3. TOILE → T(x) O(✓) I(-) L(x) E(✓)
   - O is fixed in position 2 (already known).
   - E is fixed in position 5 (already known).
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - T, L are not in the word.

So the pattern is:
- Position 2: O (✓)
- Position 5: E (✓)
- Position 3: NOT I (from TOILE feedback)
- Forbidden letters so far: A, R, S, M, N, Y, T, L

Letters still allowed (besides O and E already placed):
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z
Vowels: I, U (since A is out, O and E are used)

We need:
- Position 1: any allowed letter
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: any allowed letter except I (from TOILE feedback)
- Position 4: any allowed letter
- Position 5: E

Possible patterns:
- _ O _ _ E
with positions 1,3,4 chosen from allowed letters, and position 3 ≠ I.

Looking for common words:
- B O B B E (invalid, repeats B)
- C O B B E (invalid)
- D O B B E (invalid)
- F O B B E (invalid)
- G O B B E (invalid)
- H O B B E (invalid)
- P O B B E (invalid)
- V O B B E (invalid)
- W O B B E (invalid)

Instead, look for words like:
- B O O B E (invalid)
- C O O D E (invalid, D allowed, but O repeats)
- D O O D E (invalid)
- F O O D E (invalid)
- G O O D E (invalid)
- H O O D E (invalid)
- P O O D E (invalid)
- V O O D E (invalid)
- W O O D E (invalid)

Actually, we need to avoid O in position 3 (from AROSE feedback). So position 3 must be a consonant or U.

Let’s list possible words ending in O E with position 3 not I and avoiding forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- B O U G E (invalid, G is allowed, but word not common)
- C O U G E (invalid)
- D O U B E (invalid)
- F O U N D (invalid, ends in D)
- G O U N D (invalid)
- H O U N D (invalid)
- P O U N D (invalid)
- V O U N D (invalid)
- W O U N D (invalid)

Wait, we need 5-letter words ending in E with pattern _ O _ _ E.

Looking for common words:
- B O U G E (invalid)
- C O U G E (invalid)
- D O U B E (invalid)
- F O U N D (invalid)
- G O U N D (invalid)
- H O U N D (invalid)
- P O U N D (invalid)
- V O U N D (invalid)
- W O U N D (invalid)

Actually, let’s think differently. We have:
- Position 2: O
- Position 5: E
- Position 3: not I, not O (from AROSE feedback, O is not in position 3)
- Forbidden letters: A, R, S, M, N, Y, T, L

So position 3 must be a consonant or U (since I is excluded).

Possible words:
- B O U G E (invalid)
- C O U G E (invalid)
- D O U B E (invalid)
- F O U N D (invalid)
- G O U N D (invalid)
- H O U N D (invalid)
- P O U N D (invalid)
- V O U N D (invalid)
- W O U N D (invalid)

This seems tricky. Let’s try to construct a word:
- Position 1: B
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: U (allowed)
- Position 4: G
- Position 5: E
→ B O U G E (invalid)

Another:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: G
- Position 5: E
→ C O U G E (invalid)

Another:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: B
- Position 5: E
→ D O U B E (invalid)

Another:
- Position 1: F
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: E
→ F O U N E (invalid)

Another:
- Position 1: G
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: E
→ G O U N E (invalid)

Another:
- Position 1: H
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: E
→ H O U N E (invalid)

Another:
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: E
→ P O U N E (invalid)

Another:
- Position 1: V
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: E
→ V O U N E (invalid)

Another:
- Position 1: W
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: E
→ W O U N E (invalid)

This is not working. Let’s try position 3 as a consonant.

Possible words:
- B O B B E (invalid)
- C O B B E (invalid)
- D O B B E (invalid)
- F O B B E (invalid)
- G O B B E (invalid)
- H O B B E (invalid)
- P O B B E (invalid)
- V O B B E (invalid)
- W O B B E (invalid)

Another approach: look for words ending in O E with position 3 not I and avoiding forbidden letters.

Possible valid words:
- B O U G E (invalid)
- C O U G E (invalid)
- D O U B E (invalid)
- F O U N D (invalid)
- G O U N D (invalid)
- H O U N D (invalid)
- P O U N D (invalid)
- V O U N D (invalid)
- W O U N D (invalid)

Actually, let’s think of ""BOUGE"" is invalid, but ""BOUGE"" is not a common word. Let’s try ""COUGE"" is invalid. ""DOUGE"" is invalid.

Another possible word: ""BOUGE"" is invalid. ""FOUGE"" is invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters and covers a broad range of vowels and consonants. This helps eliminate many possibilities early on.

Common starting words include:
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- A, E (common vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)
- O (another vowel)
This gives good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
- E is in the word AND in position 5 (✓).

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains an O somewhere other than the 3rd position.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing O (not in position 3), and avoiding A, R, S.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ _ O E
- _ _ O _ E
- _ O _ _ E
- O _ _ _ E

Common consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's pick a word that fits these constraints and uses common remaining letters. ""POINT"" is out (has I and T, but we don't know about I yet). ""HOVEL"" has H, O, V, E, L - but V is less common. ""CLOVE"" has C, L, O, V, E - again V is less common. ""HOPE"" is 4 letters. ""GLOVE"" has G, L, O, V, E - still V. ""MONEY"" has M, O, N, E, Y - this looks good: M, O, N, E, Y. It ends in E, has O (position 2), and avoids A, R, S.

Let's try ""MONEY"".

<guess>MONEY</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: MONEY -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is in position 5 (✓)
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)
   - A, R, S are not in the word

2. MONEY → M(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)
   - O is in position 2 (✓)
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-)
   - M, N, Y are not in the word

Combining both:
- Word ends with E (position 5)
- O is in position 2
- Letters not in the word: A, R, S, M, N, Y
- So far we have: _ O _ _ E

We need three more letters (positions 1, 3, 4) that are not A, R, S, M, N, Y. Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, P, T, V, W, etc. Vowels left: I, U (since O and E are used).

Possible patterns:
- _ O _ _ E
- We can try common combinations like B, C, D, F, G, H, L, P, T, V, W with vowels I or U.

Let's think of words:
- B O O B E (invalid, repeats B)
- C O B E E (invalid)
- D O L E E (invalid)
- F O O D E (invalid)
- G O O D E (invalid)
- H O O K E (invalid)
- P O O L E (invalid)
- T O O L E (invalid)
- W O O D E (invalid)

Wait, we need to avoid A, R, S, M, N, Y. So letters allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z, etc.

Looking for valid 5-letter words ending in E with O in position 2 and avoiding forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- B O I L E
- C O B B E (invalid)
- D O I L E
- F O I L E
- G O I L E
- H O I L E
- P O I L E
- T O I L E
- V O I L E
- W O I L E

Among these, ""HOILE"" is not a valid word. ""DOILE"" is not valid. ""FOILE"" is not valid. ""GOILE"" is not valid. ""POILE"" is not valid. ""TOILE"" is a valid word (a type of fabric).

Let's check:
- T O I L E
  - T, O, I, L, E
  - O is in position 2 (✓)
  - E is in position 5 (✓)
  - Letters used: T, O, I, L, E
  - Forbidden letters: A, R, S, M, N, Y - none of these are used.
  - This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""COILE"" is not valid. ""BOILE"" is not valid. ""VOILE"" is valid (a type of fabric).

Between ""TOILE"" and ""VOILE"", both are valid. ""TOILE"" seems more common.

Let's go with ""TOILE"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain by choosing a word that contains common letters and covers a broad range of vowels and consonants. This helps eliminate many possibilities early on.

Common starting words include:
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains:
- A, E (common vowels)
- R, S (common consonants)
- O (another vowel)
This gives good coverage of common letters to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
- E is in the word AND in position 5 (✓).

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains an O somewhere other than the 3rd position.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing O (not in position 3), and avoiding A, R, S.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ _ O E
- _ _ O _ E
- _ O _ _ E
- O _ _ _ E

Common consonants left to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's pick a word that fits these constraints and uses common remaining letters. ""POINT"" is out (has I and T, but we don't know about I yet). ""HOVEL"" has H, O, V, E, L - but V is less common. ""CLOVE"" has C, L, O, V, E - again V is less common. ""HOPE"" is 4 letters. ""GLOVE"" has G, L, O, V, E - still V. ""MONEY"" has M, O, N, E, Y - this looks good: M, O, N, E, Y. It ends in E, has O (position 2), and avoids A, R, S.

Let's try ""MONEY"".

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is in position 5 (✓)
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)
   - A, R, S are not in the word

2. MONEY → M(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)
   - O is in position 2 (✓)
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-)
   - M, N, Y are not in the word

Combining both:
- Word ends with E (position 5)
- O is in position 2
- Letters not in the word: A, R, S, M, N, Y
- So far we have: _ O _ _ E

We need three more letters (positions 1, 3, 4) that are not A, R, S, M, N, Y. Common remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, P, T, V, W, etc. Vowels left: I, U (since O and E are used).

Possible patterns:
- _ O _ _ E
- We can try common combinations like B, C, D, F, G, H, L, P, T, V, W with vowels I or U.

Let's think of words:
- B O O B E (invalid, repeats B)
- C O B E E (invalid)
- D O L E E (invalid)
- F O O D E (invalid)
- G O O D E (invalid)
- H O O K E (invalid)
- P O O L E (invalid)
- T O O L E (invalid)
- W O O D E (invalid)

Wait, we need to avoid A, R, S, M, N, Y. So letters allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z, etc.

Looking for valid 5-letter words ending in E with O in position 2 and avoiding forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- B O I L E
- C O B B E (invalid)
- D O I L E
- F O I L E
- G O I L E
- H O I L E
- P O I L E
- T O I L E
- V O I L E
- W O I L E

Among these, ""HOILE"" is not a valid word. ""DOILE"" is not valid. ""FOILE"" is not valid. ""GOILE"" is not valid. ""POILE"" is not valid. ""TOILE"" is a valid word (a type of fabric).

Let's check:
- T O I L E
  - T, O, I, L, E
  - O is in position 2 (✓)
  - E is in position 5 (✓)
  - Letters used: T, O, I, L, E
  - Forbidden letters: A, R, S, M, N, Y - none of these are used.

From the latest feedback:

BOGIE → B(✓) O(✓) G(x) I(✓) E(✓)

This means:
- B is in position 1 (✓)
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- G is NOT in the word (x)
- I is in position 4 (✓)
- E is in position 5 (✓)

So the pattern is now fully determined: B O _ I E

We only need to find a valid 5-letter word that matches B O _ I E.

Looking at common English words:
- B O _ I E
  - B O D I E (invalid)
  - B O K I E (invalid)
  - B O P I E (invalid)
  - B O V I E (invalid)
  - B O F I E (invalid)
  - B O H I E (invalid)
  - B O W I E (invalid)

Wait, ""BODIE"" is a valid word (a type of gun or a surname). However, we have to check if any letters are forbidden.

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, S, M, N, Y, T, L, G

""BODIE"" uses B, O, D, I, E - none of these are forbidden.

Therefore, ""BODIE"" fits perfectly.
