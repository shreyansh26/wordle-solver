For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. 

Looking at common letters in English, I see that letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, I, O, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, K, W, V, F, Y, etc., are very common. 

A good starting word should ideally contain:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'm going to choose ""RAISE"" because it includes:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give us good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: x → R is not in the word at all.
- A: - → A is in the word but not in position 2.
- I: x → I is not in the word.
- S: - → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E: x → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, I, E
- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): A, S
- We still need three more distinct letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, I, E).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S (since they are confirmed present).
2. Does NOT contain R, I, or E.
3. Uses A and S in different positions than before (A not in 2nd, S not in 4th).

Possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3, 5

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints and also introduces new common letters (like T, N, L, C, D, etc.) to maximize information.

A good candidate is “STAND”:
- S is in position 1 (different from position 4 in RAISE).
- A is in position 3 (different from position 2 in RAISE).
- Contains new common letters T, N, D.

Let’s verify:
- S is in the word (✓ from feedback)
- A is in the word (✓ from feedback)
- No R, I, E (✓)
- New letters T, N, D introduced.

This should give us good information about the remaining letters and positions.

Looking at common letters in English, I see that letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, I, O, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, K, W, V, F, Y, etc., are very common.

- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'm going to choose ""RAISE"" because it includes:

- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: x → R is not in the word at all.
- A: - → A is in the word but not in position 2.
- I: x → I is not in the word.
- S: - → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E: x → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, I, E
- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): A, S
- We still need three more distinct letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, I, E).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S (since they are confirmed present).
2. Does NOT contain R, I, or E.
3. Uses A and S in different positions than before (A not in 2nd, S not in 4th).

Possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3, 5

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints and also introduces new common letters (like T, N, L, C, D, etc.) to maximize information.

A good candidate is “STAND”:
- S is in position 1 (different from position 4 in RAISE).
- A is in position 3 (different from position 2 in RAISE).
- Contains new common letters T, N, D.

Let’s verify:
- S is in the word (✓ from feedback)
- A is in the word (✓ from feedback)
- No R, I, E (✓)
- New letters T, N, D introduced.

This should give us good information about the remaining letters and positions.

2. Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:  
   – S is in position 1 (✓)

3. Therefore the pattern so far is: S _ A _ _

We still need two more letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, I, E, T, N, D).  
Common remaining letters: C, L, M, P, U, Y, B, G, H, K, O, V, W, F, etc.

We want a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S, has A in the 3rd position.  
- Uses two new letters (not yet tested).  
- Avoids any of the eliminated letters (R, I, E, T, N, D).

Candidate words fitting S _ A _ _:

- SCALY – L and Y are fine.  
- SABLE – B and L are fine.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. 

Looking at common letters in English, I see that letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, I, O, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, K, W, V, F, Y, etc., are very common. 

A good starting word should ideally contain:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'm going to choose ""RAISE"" because it includes:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give us good coverage of common letters and positions.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once. 

Looking at common letters in English, I see that letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, I, O, C, U, D, P, M, H, G, B, K, W, V, F, Y, etc., are very common. 

A good starting word should ideally contain:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- CRISP (contains C, R, I, S, P)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'm going to choose ""RAISE"" because it includes:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This should give us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: x → R is not in the word at all.
- A: - → A is in the word but not in position 2.
- I: x → I is not in the word.
- S: - → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E: x → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, I, E
- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): A, S
- We still need three more distinct letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, I, E).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S (since they are confirmed present).
2. Does NOT contain R, I, or E.
3. Uses A and S in different positions than before (A not in 2nd, S not in 4th).

Possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for S: 1, 2, 3, 5

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints and also introduces new common letters (like T, N, L, C, D, etc.) to maximize information.

A good candidate is “STAND”:
- S is in position 1 (different from position 4 in RAISE).
- A is in position 3 (different from position 2 in RAISE).
- Contains new common letters T, N, D.

Let’s verify:
- S is in the word (✓ from feedback)
- A is in the word (✓ from feedback)
- No R, I, E (✓)
- New letters T, N, D introduced.

This should give us good information about the remaining letters and positions.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

2. Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:

   – A is in position 3 (✓)  
3. Therefore the pattern so far is: S _ A _ _

We still need two more letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, I, E, T, N, D).  
Common remaining letters: C, L, M, P, U, Y, B, G, H, K, O, V, W, F, etc.

We want a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S, has A in the 3rd position.  
- Uses two new letters (not yet tested).
