For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. The best strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should contain as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some strong starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid English word.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - O is fixed in position 3.
   - R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 1 (because in ROBIN, R was in position 1 and got “-”).
   - A, S, E are not in the word.

2. ROBIN → R(-) O(-) B(x) I(x) N(x)
   - O was in position 3 and got “-” here, which means O is still in the word but NOT in position 3. This contradicts the first round feedback where O was ✓ in position 3.  
   - The only consistent interpretation is that the “-” for O in ROBIN means O is in the word but not in position 3, while the “✓” in AROSE means O IS in position 3.  
   - Therefore, the feedback must have been misread: the “-” in ROBIN for O simply confirms O is in the word but not in position 3 (which conflicts with AROSE), but since AROSE already gave O ✓ in position 3, the only resolution is that O is indeed in position 3 and the “-” in ROBIN for O is irrelevant or a typo.  
   - To resolve this, I’ll proceed under the assumption that O is in position 3 (from AROSE) and R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (from AROSE and ROBIN).

So current constraints:
- Position 3 = O
- R is in the word, but not in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- Forbidden letters: A, S, E, B, I, N
- Allowed letters so far: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not yet excluded)

Possible positions for R: 4 or 5.

- DROOL (but L is allowed, but O repeats)
- FROTH (but T and H are allowed)
- GROIN (but I and N are excluded)
- PROUD (but U and D are allowed)
- TROOP (but O repeats)

Wait, let me list valid ones:
- CROOK – C R O O K → O repeats, but allowed
- DROOL – D R O O L → O repeats
- FROTH – F R O T H → T and H are allowed
- GROIN – G R O I N → I and N excluded
- PROUD – P R O U D → U and D allowed
- TROOP – T R O O P → O repeats
- WROTE – W R O T E → E excluded
- YOUTH – Y O U T H → O not in position 3
- CROAK – C R O A K → A excluded

Valid ones: CROOK, DROOL, FROTH, PROUD, TROOP

Between these, let’s pick one that introduces new letters to narrow down:
- PROUD introduces P, U, D
- FROTH introduces F, T, H

I’ll go with PROUD as it gives three new letters.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. The best strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should contain as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some strong starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid English word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in position 3.
- It contains R somewhere, but not in position 2.
- It does NOT contain A, S, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Contains R somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, but not position 2).
- Does not contain A, S, or E.

Possible words that fit:
- BROWN (O in 3, R in 2 – but R can’t be in 2, so this fails)
- FROST (O in 3, R in 2 – same issue)
- GROIN (O in 3, R in 2 – same issue)
- CROWN (O in 3, R in 2 – same issue)

Let me look for words with O in position 3 and R not in position 2:
- BROOD – but O is in 3 and 4, and R is in 2 (invalid)
- CROOK – O in 3, R in 2 (invalid)
- DROOP – O in 3, R in 2 (invalid)
- FROTH – O in 3, R in 2 (invalid)

Hmm, let me think differently. Maybe R is in position 1, 4, or 5.

Possible words:
- R O _ _ _ (R in 1)
- _ O _ R _ (R in 4)
- _ O _ _ R (R in 5)

Looking for valid words:
- ROBIN – O in 3, R in 1, B, I, N. Does not contain A, S, E. This seems valid.
- RODOR – Not a common word.
- ROPER – O in 3, R in 1, O, P, E – but E is excluded.
- RODOR – invalid.
- RUGBY – O in 3, R in 1, U, G, B. This seems valid too.

Between ROBIN and RUGBY, both fit. ROBIN is more common, so I’ll go with ROBIN.

Guess 2: ROBIN -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) B(x) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - O is fixed in position 3.
   - R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 1 (because in ROBIN, R was in position 1 and got “-”).
   - A, S, E are not in the word.

2. ROBIN → R(-) O(-) B(x) I(x) N(x)
   - O was in position 3 and got “-” here, which means O is still in the word but NOT in position 3. This contradicts the first round feedback where O was ✓ in position 3.  
   - The only consistent interpretation is that the “-” for O in ROBIN means O is in the word but not in position 3, while the “✓” in AROSE means O IS in position 3.  
   - Therefore, the feedback must have been misread: the “-” in ROBIN for O simply confirms O is in the word but not in position 3 (which conflicts with AROSE), but since AROSE already gave O ✓ in position 3, the only resolution is that O is indeed in position 3 and the “-” in ROBIN for O is irrelevant or a typo.  
   - To resolve this, I’ll proceed under the assumption that O is in position 3 (from AROSE) and R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (from AROSE and ROBIN).

So current constraints:
- Position 3 = O
- R is in the word, but not in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- Forbidden letters: A, S, E, B, I, N
- Allowed letters so far: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not yet excluded)

Possible positions for R: 4 or 5.

Let’s look for 5-letter words with:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- R in position 4 or 5
- No A, S, E, B, I, N

Possible candidates:
- CROOK (but O repeats, and K is allowed)
- DROOL (but L is allowed, but O repeats)
- FROTH (but T and H are allowed)
- GROIN (but I and N are excluded)
- PROUD (but U and D are allowed)
- TROOP (but O repeats)

Wait, let me list valid ones:
- CROOK – C R O O K → O repeats, but allowed
- DROOL – D R O O L → O repeats
- FROTH – F R O T H → T and H are allowed
- GROIN – G R O I N → I and N excluded
- PROUD – P R O U D → U and D allowed
- TROOP – T R O O P → O repeats
- WROTE – W R O T E → E excluded
- YOUTH – Y O U T H → O not in position 3
- CROAK – C R O A K → A excluded

Valid ones: CROOK, DROOL, FROTH, PROUD, TROOP

Between these, let’s pick one that introduces new letters to narrow down:

   - To resolve this, I’ll proceed under the assumption that O is in position 3 (from AROSE) and R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (from AROSE and ROBIN).

So current constraints:
- Position 3 = O
- R is in the word, but not in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- Forbidden letters: A, S, E, B, I, N
- Allowed letters so far: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not yet excluded)

Possible positions for R: 4 or 5.

Let’s look for 5-letter words with:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- R in position 4 or 5
- No A, S, E, B, I, N

Possible candidates:
- CROOK (but O repeats, and K is allowed)
- DROOL (but L is allowed, but O repeats)
- FROTH (but T and H are allowed)
- GROIN (but I and N are excluded)
- PROUD (but U and D are allowed)
- TROOP (but O repeats)

Wait, let me list valid ones:
- CROOK – C R O O K → O repeats, but allowed
- DROOL – D R O O L → O repeats
- FROTH – F R O T H → T and H are allowed
- GROIN – G R O I N → I and N excluded
- PROUD – P R O U D → U and D allowed
- TROOP – T R O O P → O repeats
- WROTE – W R O T E → E excluded
- YOUTH – Y O U T H → O not in position 3
- CROAK – C R O A K → A excluded

Valid ones: CROOK, DROOL, FROTH, PROUD, TROOP

Between these, let’s pick one that introduces new letters to narrow down:
- PROUD introduces P, U, D
- FROTH introduces F, T, H

I’ll go with PROUD as it gives three new letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROBIN -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) B(x) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: PROUD -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - O is fixed in position 3.
   - R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from AROSE and ROBIN).

2. ROBIN → R(-) O(-) B(x) I(x) N(x)
   - Confirms O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (contradicts AROSE).  
   - The only consistent interpretation is that the “-” in ROBIN for O simply means O is in the word but not in position 3, while the “✓” in AROSE means O IS in position 3.  
   - Therefore, the feedback must have been misread: the “-” in ROBIN for O is irrelevant or a typo, and O is indeed in position 3.

3. PROUD → P(x) R(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
   - Confirms O is in position 3 (✓) and R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (from PROUD).

So the constraints are:
- Position 3 = O
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 → R must be in position 5.
- Forbidden letters: A, S, E, B, I, N, P, U, D

Thus the pattern is: _ _ O _ R

Allowed letters for positions 1, 2, 4: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not yet excluded).

Looking for 5-letter words fitting _ _ O _ R:
- CROCK – but O is in position 3, and C is allowed.
- FROST – S excluded.
- GROIN – I, N excluded.
- JOKER – E excluded.
- KOTOR – T, K allowed.
- LORRY – R repeats, but allowed.
- MORTY – T, Y allowed.
- TORTO – not a word.
- WORRY – R repeats, but allowed.
- YORUB – B excluded.

Valid candidates: CROCK, KOTOR, LORRY, MORTY, WORRY

Let’s pick one that introduces new letters: KOTOR (K, T, O, R)

But KOTOR has O in position 3 and R in position 5, and uses K and T which haven’t been tested.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. The best strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. This helps eliminate many possibilities at once.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and D. A good starting word should contain as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some strong starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid English word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in position 3.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has an O in position 3.
- It contains R somewhere, but not in position 2.
- It does NOT contain A, S, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Contains R somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, but not position 2).
- Does not contain A, S, or E.

Possible words that fit:
- BROWN (O in 3, R in 2 – but R can’t be in 2, so this fails)
- FROST (O in 3, R in 2 – same issue)
- GROIN (O in 3, R in 2 – same issue)
- CROWN (O in 3, R in 2 – same issue)

Let me look for words with O in position 3 and R not in position 2:
- BROOD – but O is in 3 and 4, and R is in 2 (invalid)
- CROOK – O in 3, R in 2 (invalid)
- DROOP – O in 3, R in 2 (invalid)
- FROTH – O in 3, R in 2 (invalid)

Hmm, let me think differently. Maybe R is in position 1, 4, or 5.

Possible words:
- R O _ _ _ (R in 1)
- _ O _ R _ (R in 4)
- _ O _ _ R (R in 5)

Looking for valid words:
- ROBIN – O in 3, R in 1, B, I, N. Does not contain A, S, E. This seems valid.
- RODOR – Not a common word.
- ROPER – O in 3, R in 1, O, P, E – but E is excluded.
- RODOR – invalid.
- RUGBY – O in 3, R in 1, U, G, B. This seems valid too.

Between ROBIN and RUGBY, both fit. ROBIN is more common, so I’ll go with ROBIN.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - O is fixed in position 3.
   - R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 1 (because in ROBIN, R was in position 1 and got “-”).
   - A, S, E are not in the word.

2. ROBIN → R(-) O(-) B(x) I(x) N(x)
   - O was in position 3 and got “-” here, which means O is still in the word but NOT in position 3. This contradicts the first round feedback where O was ✓ in position 3.  
   - The only consistent interpretation is that the “-” for O in ROBIN means O is in the word but not in position 3, while the “✓” in AROSE means O IS in position 3.  
   - Therefore, the feedback must have been misread: the “-” in ROBIN for O simply confirms O is in the word but not in position 3 (which conflicts with AROSE), but since AROSE already gave O ✓ in position 3, the only resolution is that O is indeed in position 3 and the “-” in ROBIN for O is irrelevant or a typo.  
   - To resolve this, I’ll proceed under the assumption that O is in position 3 (from AROSE) and R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (from AROSE and ROBIN).

So current constraints:
- Position 3 = O
- R is in the word, but not in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- Forbidden letters: A, S, E, B, I, N
- Allowed letters so far: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not yet excluded)

Possible positions for R: 4 or 5.

Let’s look for 5-letter words with:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- R in position 4 or 5
- No A, S, E, B, I, N

Possible candidates:
- CROOK (but O repeats, and K is allowed)
- DROOL (but L is allowed, but O repeats)
- FROTH (but T and H are allowed)
- GROIN (but I and N are excluded)
- PROUD (but U and D are allowed)
- TROOP (but O repeats)

Wait, let me list valid ones:
- CROOK – C R O O K → O repeats, but allowed
- DROOL – D R O O L → O repeats
- FROTH – F R O T H → T and H are allowed
- GROIN – G R O I N → I and N excluded

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROBIN -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) B(x) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: PROUD -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - O is fixed in position 3.
   - R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from AROSE and ROBIN).

2. ROBIN → R(-) O(-) B(x) I(x) N(x)
   - Confirms O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (contradicts AROSE).  
   - The only consistent interpretation is that the “-” in ROBIN for O simply means O is in the word but not in position 3, while the “✓” in AROSE means O IS in position 3.  
   - Therefore, the feedback must have been misread: the “-” in ROBIN for O is irrelevant or a typo, and O is indeed in position 3.

3. PROUD → P(x) R(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
   - Confirms O is in position 3 (✓) and R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (from PROUD).

So the constraints are:
- Position 3 = O
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 → R must be in position 5.
- Forbidden letters: A, S, E, B, I, N, P, U, D

Thus the pattern is: _ _ O _ R

Allowed letters for positions 1, 2, 4: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not yet excluded).

Looking for 5-letter words fitting _ _ O _ R:
- CROCK – but O is in position 3, and C is allowed.
- FROST – S excluded.
- GROIN – I, N excluded.
- JOKER – E excluded.
- KOTOR – T, K allowed.
- LORRY – R repeats, but allowed.
- MORTY – T, Y allowed.
- TORTO – not a word.
- WORRY – R repeats, but allowed.
- YORUB – B excluded.

Valid candidates: CROCK, KOTOR, LORRY, MORTY, WORRY

Let’s pick one that introduces new letters: KOTOR (K, T, O, R)

But KOTOR has O in position 3 and R in position 5, and uses K and T which haven’t been tested.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROBIN -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) B(x) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: PROUD -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(-) O(✓) U(x) D(x)
Guess 4: KOTOR -> FEEDBACK: K(x) O(-) T(x) O(-) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback on KOTOR:

K(x)  O(-)  T(x)  O(-)  R(✓)

Interpretation:
- K is not in the word.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (because it got “-”).
- T is not in the word.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 4 (because it got “-”).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, since it got “✓”).

So now we know:
- Position 3 = O (from AROSE)
- Position 5 = R (from KOTOR)
- O is also in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from KOTOR feedback).  
  Since position 3 is already O, this is consistent.
- Forbidden letters so far: A, S, E, B, I, N, P, U, D, K, T

Pattern: _ _ O _ R

Allowed letters for positions 1, 2, 4: C, F, G, H, J, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not yet excluded).

Looking for 5-letter words of the form _ _ O _ R:
- CROCK – C, R, O, C, K → K excluded.
- FROST – S excluded.
- GROIN – I, N excluded.
- JOKER – E excluded.
- LORRY – R repeats, but allowed.
- MORTY – T excluded.

From the feedback on WORRY:

W(x)  O(-)  R(-)  R(✓)  Y(x)

Interpretation:
- W is not in the word.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (because it got “-”).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (because it got “-”).
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since it got “✓”).
- Y is not in the word.

So now we know:
- Position 3 = O (from AROSE)
- Position 4 = R (from WORRY)
- Position 5 = R (from KOTOR)
- Therefore the word must be _ _ O R R

Forbidden letters so far: A, S, E, B, I, N, P, U, D, K, T, W, Y
