For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - good mix of common consonants and vowels
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - another strong choice
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E - covers multiple vowels and common consonants

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes very common letters (S, T) and covers the vowels A and E, which appear frequently in English words. This should give us good initial information about which letters might be in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
- The word contains the letter A, but not in position 3.
- The letters S, L, T, E are excluded.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Contains A (since it's confirmed in the word).
2. Avoids S, L, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to gather more information.

Good remaining consonants to test: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Vowels left to test: I, O, U (A is already confirmed).

A strong candidate is ""CRAIN"":
- C, R, A, I, N - all new letters except A (which we know is present).
- Positions: A is in position 3 here, but we know it's not in position 3 from SLATE, so this is safe.
- Covers C, R, N, I which are all common letters.

Another good option is ""GRAIN"":
- G, R, A, I, N - same reasoning.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - good mix of common consonants and vowels
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - another strong choice
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E - covers multiple vowels and common consonants

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes very common letters (S, T) and covers the vowels A and E, which appear frequently in English words. This should give us good initial information about which letters might be in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
- The word contains the letter A, but not in position 3.
- The letters S, L, T, E are excluded.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Contains A (since it's confirmed in the word).
2. Avoids S, L, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to gather more information.

Good remaining consonants to test: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Vowels left to test: I, O, U (A is already confirmed).

A strong candidate is ""CRAIN"":
- C, R, A, I, N - all new letters except A (which we know is present).
- Positions: A is in position 3 here, but we know it's not in position 3 from SLATE, so this is safe.
- Covers C, R, N, I which are all common letters.

Another good option is ""GRAIN"":
- G, R, A, I, N - same reasoning.

I'll go with ""CRAIN"" as it uses C and N which are quite common.

- Letter A is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from SLATE: A was in position 3, and from CRAIN: A was in position 3 again, so both times it was wrong position).

So A must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

Remaining common letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, O, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A in one of positions 1, 2, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Good candidates:
- M A D U R (but U is less common)
- B A D G Y
- H A M M Y
- P A U L Y
- G O A L D (but D and L are out)
- B O A R D (R is out)
- F O A M Y

Looking at these, ""BADGY"" seems strong:
- B, D, G, Y are all new letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).

2. A is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4, 5 (from SLATE, CRAIN, BADGY, HOGGA).  
   Therefore A must be in position 1 or 2.
3. O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
4. H is NOT in the word (x).

Letters already ruled out: S, L, T, E, C, R, I, N, B, D, Y, H.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a variety of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E - good mix of common consonants and vowels
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E - another strong choice
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E - covers multiple vowels and common consonants

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it includes very common letters (S, T) and covers the vowels A and E, which appear frequently in English words. This should give us good initial information about which letters might be in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
- The word contains the letter A, but not in position 3.
- The letters S, L, T, E are excluded.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Contains A (since it's confirmed in the word).
2. Avoids S, L, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to gather more information.

Good remaining consonants to test: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Vowels left to test: I, O, U (A is already confirmed).

A strong candidate is ""CRAIN"":
- C, R, A, I, N - all new letters except A (which we know is present).
- Positions: A is in position 3 here, but we know it's not in position 3 from SLATE, so this is safe.
- Covers C, R, N, I which are all common letters.

Another good option is ""GRAIN"":
- G, R, A, I, N - same reasoning.

I'll go with ""CRAIN"" as it uses C and N which are quite common.

Guess 2: CRAIN -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we now know:

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, C, R, I, N
- Letter A is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from SLATE: A was in position 3, and from CRAIN: A was in position 3 again, so both times it was wrong position).

So A must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

Remaining common letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, O, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A in one of positions 1, 2, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Good candidates:
- M A D U R (but U is less common)
- B A D G Y
- H A M M Y
- P A U L Y
- G O A L D (but D and L are out)
- B O A R D (R is out)
- F O A M Y

Looking at these, ""BADGY"" seems strong:
- B, D, G, Y are all new letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRAIN -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)
Guess 3: BADGY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(-) D(x) G(✓) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on BADGY:

- B, D, Y are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from BADGY) and also NOT in position 3 (from SLATE) or 4 (from CRAIN).  
  Therefore A must be in position 1 or 5.
- G is in the word AND in the correct position (✓), so G is in position 4.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, C, R, I, N, B, D, Y
- G is in position 4.
- A is in the word and must be in position 1 or 5.

Remaining common letters to test: F, H, K, M, P, U, O, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- G in position 4.
- A in position 1 or 5.
- Only letters from the remaining pool.

Possible patterns:
1. A _ _ G _
2. _ _ _ G A

Let's think of valid words fitting these patterns:
- A _ _ G _ : ""AGLOW"" (but O and W are allowed, L is out), ""AGONY"" (N is out), ""AGILE"" (I and E are out), ""AGAVE"" (V is allowed, E is out), ""AGLOW"" seems possible but L is out.  
- _ _ _ G A : ""FOGGA"" (double G), ""HOGGA"" (H allowed), ""MOGGA"" (M allowed), ""POGGA"" (P allowed), ""WOGGA"" (W allowed).

Among these, ""HOGGA"" uses H and O which are still allowed, and fits _ _ _ G A.

Another candidate is ""FOGGA"" but F is allowed.  
""HOGGA"" seems better as it tests H and O.

Let's verify:
- H, O, G, G, A.
- G is in position 4 (✓).
- A is in position 5 (allowed).
- H and O are new letters.

Thus, ""HOGGA"" is a valid next guess.

Let’s extract everything we know from the four guesses so far.

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.  
   – S, L, T, E are not in the word.

2. CRAIN → C(x) R(x) A(-) I(x) N(x)  
   – A is in the word but not in position 3 (already known) and also not in position 3 again (so still not position 3).  
   – C, R, I, N are not in the word.

3. BADGY → B(x) A(-) D(x) G(✓) Y(x)  
   – A is in the word but not in position 2.  
   – B, D, Y are not in the word.  
   – G is in the word and in position 4.

4. HOGGA → H(x) O(-) G(-) G(✓) A(-)  
   – G is in position 4 (already known).  
   – O is in the word but not in position 2.  
   – A is in the word but not in position 5.  
   – H is not in the word.

Letters we know are NOT in the word:  
S, L, T, E, C, R, I, N, B, D, Y, H

Letters we know ARE in the word:  
A, G, O

Positions we now know:  
- Position 4 = G  
- A is in the word but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 → therefore A must be in position 1.  
- O is in the word but cannot be in position 2 → so O must be in position 3 or 5.

We still need to fill positions 2, 3, 5 with letters that are not yet ruled out.  
Available letters (not yet eliminated): F, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z, and any others not listed.

We need a 5-letter word of the form:  
A _ _ G _ or A _ _ G _ with O in position 3 or 5.

Let’s try to find a word that fits A _ O G _ or A _ _ G O.

Candidate words:  
- AFOGA (but double G is unlikely)  
- AMOGO (but O is repeated)  
- APGOW (but W is allowed)  
- AFOGO (but O is repeated)  

The most common and valid word fitting A _ O G _ is **AMOGO**, but O is repeated.  
Another possibility is **APGOW**, but that’s less common.

Actually, let’s list valid 5-letter words with A _ O G _:

- AMOGO – not common  
- APGOW – not common  
- AFOGO – not common  

Let’s instead try A _ _ G O, since O could be in position 5.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form A _ _ G O.

Candidate words:  
- AFOGO – not valid  
- AMIGO – valid (but I is out)  
- AMIGO – invalid (I is out)  
- AMIGO – invalid  
- AMIGO – invalid  

Another candidate: **AFGOW** – not valid.
