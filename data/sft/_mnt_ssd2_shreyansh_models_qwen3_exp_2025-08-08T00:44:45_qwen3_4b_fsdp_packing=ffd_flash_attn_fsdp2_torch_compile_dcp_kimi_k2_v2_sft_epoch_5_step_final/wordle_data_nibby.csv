### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives us maximum information. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 consonants (R, S) which are also very common
- All letters are distinct, giving us maximum information

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common letters.  
I now want a word that uses completely different, still-common letters to maximize new information.  
Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, E, O are out).  

A classic second-guess word is “UNTIL” because it uses:  
- U (vowel)

None of these letters were in AROSE, so they’ll give fresh information.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ None of A, R, O, S, E appear in the secret word.

2. UNTIL → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)  
   ⇒ U, T, L are ruled out.  
   ⇒ N and I are in the word but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

So the letters we can use are:  
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: I (already confirmed present), plus Y (sometimes vowel).

Positions we know:  
- Position 2 ≠ N  
- Position 4 ≠ I  

We need a 5-letter word that contains both N and I, uses only letters not yet eliminated, and places N and I in new positions.

A good candidate is “CHINK”:
- C, H, K are still allowed.  
- I is in position 3 (new).  
- N is in position 2 (new).  
- No letters from AROSE or UNTIL are used.

This gives us fresh information about C, H, K, I, and N’s placement.

Summary of what we know so far:

- Positions still open for N: 1, 3, 5

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and gives us maximum information. A good strategy is to pick a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular choices include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 consonants (R, S) which are also very common
- All letters are distinct, giving us maximum information

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That eliminates a large chunk of common letters.  
I now want a word that uses completely different, still-common letters to maximize new information.  
Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, E, O are out).  

A classic second-guess word is “UNTIL” because it uses:  
- U (vowel)  
- N, T, L, I (common consonants and remaining vowel).  

None of these letters were in AROSE, so they’ll give fresh information.

Guess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   ⇒ None of A, R, O, S, E appear in the secret word.

2. UNTIL → U(x) N(-) T(x) I(-) L(x)  
   ⇒ U, T, L are ruled out.  
   ⇒ N and I are in the word but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.

So the letters we can use are:  
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: I (already confirmed present), plus Y (sometimes vowel).

Positions we know:  
- Position 2 ≠ N  
- Position 4 ≠ I  

We need a 5-letter word that contains both N and I, uses only letters not yet eliminated, and places N and I in new positions.

A good candidate is “CHINK”:
- C, H, K are still allowed.  
- I is in position 3 (new).  
- N is in position 2 (new).  
- No letters from AROSE or UNTIL are used.

This gives us fresh information about C, H, K, I, and N’s placement.

   - I (✓ in position 2)  
   - N (still “-” in positions 4 and 5, but we now know it’s not in position 2 from UNTIL or position 4 from CHINK or 5 from MIXIN).

3. Allowed letters left (not yet ruled out):  
   B, D, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z, plus the fixed I and N.

4. Word structure so far:  
   - Position 2 = I  
   - N must be in position 1 or 3.  
   - Remaining positions (3, 4, 5 if N is in 1, or 1, 4, 5 if N is in 3) must use only allowed letters.

5. Candidate words:  
   - If N is in position 1: N I _ _ _

Let's consolidate everything we know after five guesses.

Eliminated letters (marked “x” at least once):  
A, R, O, S, E, U, T, L, C, H, K, M, X, F

Confirmed present letters:  
- I (✓ in position 2)  
- N (still “-” in positions 3, 4, 5)  
- Y (✓ in position 5)

So the secret word looks like:  
_ I _ _ Y  
with N somewhere in positions 1 or 3 (it cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5).

Allowed letters left (not yet ruled out):  
B, D, G, J, P, Q, V, W, Z, plus the fixed I, N, Y.

Possible word structures:  
1. N I _ _ Y  (N in position 1)  
2. _ I N _ Y  (N in position 3)

Let's list valid 5-letter words that fit these patterns using only the allowed letters:

1. N I _ _ Y  
   - NINNY (N repeated, but N is allowed)  
   - NIPPY (P is allowed)  
   - NIBBY (B is allowed)

2. _ I N _ Y  
   - PINNY (P is allowed)  
   - DINNY (D is allowed)  
   - VINNY (V is allowed)

Among these, “NINNY” and “NIPPY” are the most common. “NINNY” uses only N, I, Y and gives new info on the second N. “NIPPY” uses P, which is still allowed.

I’ll choose “NIPPY” as it tests P in position 3 and keeps the structure consistent.
