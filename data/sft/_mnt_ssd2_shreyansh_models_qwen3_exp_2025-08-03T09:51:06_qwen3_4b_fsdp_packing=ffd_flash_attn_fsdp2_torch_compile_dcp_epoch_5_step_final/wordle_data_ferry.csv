Since this is the first guess and we have no feedback to work with, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should include frequently used letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum information about the presence and positions of these letters in the secret word.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - also very common letters. However, ""AROSE"" tends to be slightly more effective in many word-guessing analyses.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a good mix of common vowels and consonants to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, E (but in wrong positions)
- R is not in position 2
- E is not in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both R and E
2. Does not contain A, O, or S
3. R is not in position 2
4. E is not in position 5

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out, E is in, and we might have another vowel)

Let’s try to build a word with these constraints. A good candidate is “ENTER”:
- Contains E (twice) and R
- No A, O, S
- R is in position 4 (not 2) ✓
- E is in positions 1 and 3 (not 5) ✓

But “ENTER” has T which we haven’t tested yet. Another candidate is “TREND”:

Next: “PERIL”

- R in position 3 ✓

- No A, O, S ✓
- E is not in position 5 ✓

This seems valid. Let’s choose “PERIL”.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are in the word and in the correct positions:
   - E is in position 2 (✓)
   - R is in position 3 (✓)

2. Letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions (from Guess 1):
   - R was in position 2 in AROSE but we now know it’s in position 3, so this is already satisfied.
   - E was in position 5 in AROSE but we now know it’s in position 2, so this is already satisfied.

3. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   - A, O, S, P, I, L

4. Therefore, the secret word must be of the form:
   _ E R _ _

5. We still need to determine positions 1, 4, and 5.
   Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

6. Common remaining consonants and vowels: C, D, N, T, U (since I is out).

7. Let’s try a word that fits _ E R _ _ and uses new letters. A good candidate is “TERED” (but this is not a valid English word). Another is “NERED” (invalid). “BERET” is invalid because T is in position 5 and E is already in position 2. 

8. A valid word that fits: “CERED” – but “CERED” is not valid. “DERED” – not valid. “FURED” – not valid. 

9. Let’s think of common English words with pattern _ E R _ _. Examples:
   - “HERED” – invalid
   - “MERIT” – but I and T are allowed? Wait, I is already ruled out.
   - “TREND” – but N and D are allowed, and R is already in position 3. But T is position 1, E position 2, R position 3, N position 4, D position 5. This fits the pattern _ E R _ _.

10. Checking “TREND”:
    - T (position 1) – not yet ruled out
    - R (position 3) – already confirmed correct
    - E (position 2) – already confirmed correct
    - N (position 4) – not yet ruled out
    - D (position 5) – not yet ruled out
    - No forbidden letters (A, O, S, P, I, L)

11. “TREND” seems valid. However, let’s see if there’s a simpler word. Another candidate is “NERVE” but V is not ruled out, yet N is position 1, E position 2, R position 3, V position 4, E position 5. But E is already confirmed in position 2, and the second E in position 5 would conflict with earlier feedback (E was in position 5 in AROSE and marked as wrong position, so E cannot be in position 5). Therefore “NERVE” is invalid.

12. Next candidate: “CREST” – but S is ruled out.
13. “DREED” – invalid
14. “GREET” – but G is allowed, and the word is valid, but E is in position 2, R in 3, and we have two E’s. However, we don’t know if E appears twice. The feedback doesn’t indicate duplicates.
15. “BREAD” – but A is ruled out.
16. “FRESH” – but S and H are allowed, but S is ruled out.
17. “WRECK” – but C and K are allowed, and W is allowed. Pattern: W E R _ _ – needs two more letters. “WRECK” fits _ E R _ _ with W E R C K. C and K are not ruled out.

But let’s pick a word that uses common remaining letters and is valid. “TREND” seems the best fit among common words. However, let me verify:

- T (1), E (2), R (3), N (4), D (5) – all letters allowed, no conflicts.

But to be more certain, let’s try “TREND”.

Wait, let me double-check: “TREND” is a valid English word, fits _ E R _ _, and uses new letters T, N, D which have not been tested yet. This seems optimal.

However, another candidate is “WRECK” (W E R C K). Both are valid, but “TREND” is slightly more common.

I’ll go with “TREND”.

14. “GREET” – but G is allowed, and the word is valid, but E is in position 2, R in 3, and we have two E’s. However, we don’t know if E appears twice. The feedback doesn’t indicate duplicates.
15. “BREAD” – but A is ruled out.
16. “FRESH” – but S and H are allowed, but S is ruled out.
17. “WRECK” – but C and K are allowed, and W is allowed. Pattern: W E R _ _ – needs two more letters. “WRECK” fits _ E R _ _ with W E R C K. C and K are not ruled out.

But let’s pick a word that uses common remaining letters and is valid. “TREND” seems the best fit among common words. However, let me verify:

- T (1), E (2), R (3), N (4), D (5) – all letters allowed, no conflicts.

But to be more certain, let’s try “TREND”.

Wait, let me double-check: “TREND” is a valid English word, fits _ E R _ _, and uses new letters T, N, D which have not been tested yet. This seems optimal.

However, another candidate is “WRECK” (W E R C K). Both are valid, but “TREND” is slightly more common.

I’ll go with “TREND”.",Guess 3: TREND -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and we have no feedback to work with, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should include frequently used letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum information about the presence and positions of these letters in the secret word.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - also very common letters. However, ""AROSE"" tends to be slightly more effective in many word-guessing analyses.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a good mix of common vowels and consonants to start narrowing down possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, E (but in wrong positions)
- R is not in position 2
- E is not in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both R and E
2. Does not contain A, O, or S
3. R is not in position 2
4. E is not in position 5

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out, E is in, and we might have another vowel)

Let’s try to build a word with these constraints. A good candidate is “ENTER”:
- Contains E (twice) and R
- No A, O, S
- R is in position 4 (not 2) ✓
- E is in positions 1 and 3 (not 5) ✓

But “ENTER” has T which we haven’t tested yet. Another candidate is “TREND”:
- T, R, E, N, D
- R in position 2 → but feedback says R is not in position 2 → invalid

Next candidate: “CRUEL”
- C, R, E, U, L
- R in position 2 → invalid (same issue)

Next: “PERIL”
- P, E, R, I, L
- R in position 3 ✓
- E in position 2 ✓
- No A, O, S ✓
- E is not in position 5 ✓

This seems valid. Let’s choose “PERIL”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: PERIL -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) R(✓) I(x) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are in the word and in the correct positions:
   - E is in position 2 (✓)
   - R is in position 3 (✓)

2. Letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions (from Guess 1):
   - R was in position 2 in AROSE but we now know it’s in position 3, so this is already satisfied.
   - E was in position 5 in AROSE but we now know it’s in position 2, so this is already satisfied.

3. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   - A, O, S, P, I, L

4. Therefore, the secret word must be of the form:
   _ E R _ _

5. We still need to determine positions 1, 4, and 5.
   Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

6. Common remaining consonants and vowels: C, D, N, T, U (since I is out).

7. Let’s try a word that fits _ E R _ _ and uses new letters. A good candidate is “TERED” (but this is not a valid English word). Another is “NERED” (invalid). “BERET” is invalid because T is in position 5 and E is already in position 2. 

8. A valid word that fits: “CERED” – but “CERED” is not valid. “DERED” – not valid. “FURED” – not valid. 

9. Let’s think of common English words with pattern _ E R _ _. Examples:
   - “HERED” – invalid
   - “MERIT” – but I and T are allowed? Wait, I is already ruled out.
   - “TREND” – but N and D are allowed, and R is already in position 3. But T is position 1, E position 2, R position 3, N position 4, D position 5. This fits the pattern _ E R _ _.

10. Checking “TREND”:
    - T (position 1) – not yet ruled out
    - R (position 3) – already confirmed correct
    - E (position 2) – already confirmed correct
    - N (position 4) – not yet ruled out
    - D (position 5) – not yet ruled out
    - No forbidden letters (A, O, S, P, I, L)

11. “TREND” seems valid. However, let’s see if there’s a simpler word. Another candidate is “NERVE” but V is not ruled out, yet N is position 1, E position 2, R position 3, V position 4, E position 5. But E is already confirmed in position 2, and the second E in position 5 would conflict with earlier feedback (E was in position 5 in AROSE and marked as wrong position, so E cannot be in position 5). Therefore “NERVE” is invalid.

12. Next candidate: “CREST” – but S is ruled out.
13. “DREED” – invalid
14. “GREET” – but G is allowed, and the word is valid, but E is in position 2, R in 3, and we have two E’s. However, we don’t know if E appears twice. The feedback doesn’t indicate duplicates.
15. “BREAD” – but A is ruled out.
16. “FRESH” – but S and H are allowed, but S is ruled out.
17. “WRECK” – but C and K are allowed, and W is allowed. Pattern: W E R _ _ – needs two more letters. “WRECK” fits _ E R _ _ with W E R C K. C and K are not ruled out.

But let’s pick a word that uses common remaining letters and is valid. “TREND” seems the best fit among common words. However, let me verify:

Let’s consolidate everything we know after the three guesses.

1. Positions already fixed:
   - Position 2 = E (✓ from Guess 2)
   - Position 3 = R (✓ from Guess 2)

2. Letters that are in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
   - E (already placed at position 2)
   - R (already placed at position 3)
   - From Guess 1: E was in position 5 in AROSE → now known to be in position 2, so no further info.
   - From Guess 3: E was in position 3 in TREND → but R is in position 3, so this is consistent (E not in 3).

3. Letters that are NOT in the word (from all feedback):
   A, O, S, P, I, L, T, N, D

4. Pattern so far:
   _ E R _ _

5. Still-unused, allowed letters:
   B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

6. We need two more letters (positions 1 and 4-5) from the allowed set. We want a valid English word.

Let’s list possible words that fit _ E R _ _ and use only the allowed letters.

- B E R E _ → BERES? Not a word.
- B E R K _ → BERKS? Not common.
- B E R M _ → BERMS? Not common.
- C E R E _ → CERES? Not common.
- C E R V _ → CERVE? No.
- C E R V A → CERVE? No.
- F E R A _ → A is out.
- G E R M _ → GERMS? S is out.
- H E R B _ → HERBS? S is out.
- J E R K _ → JERKS? S is out.
- K E R N _ → KERN? Too short.
- M E R C _ → MERCS? Not common.
- M E R G _ → MERGS? No.
- U E R C _ → Not a word.
- W E R F _ → WERFS? No.
- W E R K _ → WERKS? No.

Wait, let’s think differently. We need a 5-letter word with pattern _ E R _ _. Some valid English words:

- BEVEL: B E V E L – but V and L are allowed? L is out (from Guess 2). So no.
- BERET: B E R E T – T is out (Guess 3).
- BERGS: B E R G S – S is out.
- BERKS: B E R K S – S is out.
- CEREB: Not a word.
- CERVE: Not a word.
- CERFS: S is out.
- FEVER: F E V E R – V is allowed, but we have E in position 2 already, so F E V E R has E in position 4, which is fine. But is FEVER a valid guess here? It fits _ E R _ _? No, FEVER is F E V E R – positions: 1-F, 2-E, 3-V, 4-E, 5-R. Doesn’t fit _ E R _ _.

Wait, the pattern is _ E R _ _. So positions: 1-?, 2-E, 3-R, 4-?, 5-?.

Looking for words matching that exact pattern:

- CEREM: Not a word.
- CERES: 4 letters.
- DEREK: D is out.
- FEVER: Doesn’t fit.
- GERAL: A is out.
- HERAL: A is out.
- JERKY: J E R K Y – K and Y are allowed. JERKY is a valid word. Let’s check:
   - J: allowed
   - E: position 2 ✓
   - R: position 3 ✓
   - K: allowed
   - Y: allowed
   - No disallowed letters (A, O, S, P, I, L, T, N, D).

This seems to fit perfectly.

Other candidates:
- MERRY: M E R R Y – R is already in position 3; we don’t know if R appears twice. The feedback doesn’t indicate duplicates, so safer to avoid.
- WERKS: W E R K S – S is out.
- BERGS: S is out.

Thus, the only valid common word left is JERKY.

Since this is the first guess and we have no feedback to work with, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should include frequently used letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum information about the presence and positions of these letters in the secret word.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - also very common letters. However, ""AROSE"" tends to be slightly more effective in many word-guessing analyses.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides a good mix of common vowels and consonants to start narrowing down possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, E (but in wrong positions)
- R is not in position 2
- E is not in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both R and E
2. Does not contain A, O, or S
3. R is not in position 2
4. E is not in position 5

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out, E is in, and we might have another vowel)

Let’s try to build a word with these constraints. A good candidate is “ENTER”:
- Contains E (twice) and R
- No A, O, S
- R is in position 4 (not 2) ✓
- E is in positions 1 and 3 (not 5) ✓

But “ENTER” has T which we haven’t tested yet. Another candidate is “TREND”:
- T, R, E, N, D
- R in position 2 → but feedback says R is not in position 2 → invalid

Next candidate: “CRUEL”
- C, R, E, U, L
- R in position 2 → invalid (same issue)

Next: “PERIL”
- P, E, R, I, L
- R in position 3 ✓
- E in position 2 ✓
- No A, O, S ✓
- E is not in position 5 ✓

This seems valid. Let’s choose “PERIL”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: PERIL -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) R(✓) I(x) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are in the word and in the correct positions:
   - E is in position 2 (✓)
   - R is in position 3 (✓)

2. Letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions (from Guess 1):
   - R was in position 2 in AROSE but we now know it’s in position 3, so this is already satisfied.
   - E was in position 5 in AROSE but we now know it’s in position 2, so this is already satisfied.

3. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   - A, O, S, P, I, L

4. Therefore, the secret word must be of the form:
   _ E R _ _

5. We still need to determine positions 1, 4, and 5.
   Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

6. Common remaining consonants and vowels: C, D, N, T, U (since I is out).

7. Let’s try a word that fits _ E R _ _ and uses new letters. A good candidate is “TERED” (but this is not a valid English word). Another is “NERED” (invalid). “BERET” is invalid because T is in position 5 and E is already in position 2. 

8. A valid word that fits: “CERED” – but “CERED” is not valid. “DERED” – not valid. “FURED” – not valid. 

9. Let’s think of common English words with pattern _ E R _ _. Examples:
   - “HERED” – invalid
   - “MERIT” – but I and T are allowed? Wait, I is already ruled out.
   - “TREND” – but N and D are allowed, and R is already in position 3. But T is position 1, E position 2, R position 3, N position 4, D position 5. This fits the pattern _ E R _ _.

10. Checking “TREND”:
    - T (position 1) – not yet ruled out
    - R (position 3) – already confirmed correct
    - E (position 2) – already confirmed correct
    - N (position 4) – not yet ruled out
    - D (position 5) – not yet ruled out
    - No forbidden letters (A, O, S, P, I, L)

11. “TREND” seems valid. However, let’s see if there’s a simpler word. Another candidate is “NERVE” but V is not ruled out, yet N is position 1, E position 2, R position 3, V position 4, E position 5. But E is already confirmed in position 2, and the second E in position 5 would conflict with earlier feedback (E was in position 5 in AROSE and marked as wrong position, so E cannot be in position 5). Therefore “NERVE” is invalid.

12. Next candidate: “CREST” – but S is ruled out.
13. “DREED” – invalid
14. “GREET” – but G is allowed, and the word is valid, but E is in position 2, R in 3, and we have two E’s. However, we don’t know if E appears twice. The feedback doesn’t indicate duplicates.
15. “BREAD” – but A is ruled out.
16. “FRESH” – but S and H are allowed, but S is ruled out.
17. “WRECK” – but C and K are allowed, and W is allowed. Pattern: W E R _ _ – needs two more letters. “WRECK” fits _ E R _ _ with W E R C K. C and K are not ruled out.

But let’s pick a word that uses common remaining letters and is valid. “TREND” seems the best fit among common words. However, let me verify:

- T (1), E (2), R (3), N (4), D (5) – all letters allowed, no conflicts.

But to be more certain, let’s try “TREND”.

Wait, let me double-check: “TREND” is a valid English word, fits _ E R _ _, and uses new letters T, N, D which have not been tested yet. This seems optimal.

However, another candidate is “WRECK” (W E R C K). Both are valid, but “TREND” is slightly more common.

I’ll go with “TREND”.

Let’s consolidate everything we know after the three guesses.

1. Positions already fixed:
   - Position 2 = E (✓ from Guess 2)
   - Position 3 = R (✓ from Guess 2)

2. Letters that are in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
   - E (already placed at position 2)
   - R (already placed at position 3)
   - From Guess 1: E was in position 5 in AROSE → now known to be in position 2, so no further info.
   - From Guess 3: E was in position 3 in TREND → but R is in position 3, so this is consistent (E not in 3).

3. Letters that are NOT in the word (from all feedback):
   A, O, S, P, I, L, T, N, D

4. Pattern so far:
   _ E R _ _

5. Still-unused, allowed letters:
   B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

6. We need two more letters (positions 1 and 4-5) from the allowed set. We want a valid English word.

Let’s list possible words that fit _ E R _ _ and use only the allowed letters.

- B E R E _ → BERES? Not a word.
- B E R K _ → BERKS? Not common.
- B E R M _ → BERMS? Not common.
- C E R E _ → CERES? Not common.
- C E R V _ → CERVE? No.
- C E R V A → CERVE? No.
- F E R A _ → A is out.
- G E R M _ → GERMS? S is out.
- H E R B _ → HERBS? S is out.
- J E R K _ → JERKS? S is out.
- K E R N _ → KERN? Too short.
- M E R C _ → MERCS? Not common.
- M E R G _ → MERGS? No.
- U E R C _ → Not a word.
- W E R F _ → WERFS? No.
- W E R K _ → WERKS? No.

Wait, let’s think differently. We need a 5-letter word with pattern _ E R _ _. Some valid English words:

- BEVEL: B E V E L – but V and L are allowed? L is out (from Guess 2). So no.
- BERET: B E R E T – T is out (Guess 3).
- BERGS: B E R G S – S is out.
- BERKS: B E R K S – S is out.
- CEREB: Not a word.
- CERVE: Not a word.
- CERFS: S is out.
- FEVER: F E V E R – V is allowed, but we have E in position 2 already, so F E V E R has E in position 4, which is fine. But is FEVER a valid guess here? It fits _ E R _ _? No, FEVER is F E V E R – positions: 1-F, 2-E, 3-V, 4-E, 5-R. Doesn’t fit _ E R _ _.

Wait, the pattern is _ E R _ _. So positions: 1-?, 2-E, 3-R, 4-?, 5-?.

Looking for words matching that exact pattern:

- CEREM: Not a word.
- CERES: 4 letters.
- DEREK: D is out.
- FEVER: Doesn’t fit.
- GERAL: A is out.
- HERAL: A is out.
- JERKY: J E R K Y – K and Y are allowed. JERKY is a valid word. Let’s check:
   - J: allowed
   - E: position 2 ✓
   - R: position 3 ✓
   - K: allowed
   - Y: allowed
   - No disallowed letters (A, O, S, P, I, L, T, N, D).

This seems to fit perfectly.

Other candidates:
- MERRY: M E R R Y – R is already in position 3; we don’t know if R appears twice. The feedback doesn’t indicate duplicates, so safer to avoid.
- WERKS: W E R K S – S is out.
- BERGS: S is out.

Thus, the only valid common word left is JERKY.Based on the feedback, the word must be of the form _ E R _ _ with letters not yet ruled out. The only common valid word fitting this pattern is:

Actually, the only valid English word that fits _ E R _ Y with allowed letters is ""FERRY"" (F E R R Y). Even though it has two R's, the feedback doesn't rule out duplicates, and we have no information against it.

Let’s try FERRY.

<guess>FERRY</guess>",FERRY,"Current confirmed information:
- Pattern: _ E R _ Y  (positions 2=E, 3=R, 5=Y)
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, P, I, L, T, N, D, J, K
- Still-allowed letters for positions 1 and 4: B, C, F, G, H, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that matches: [allowed] E R [allowed] Y.

Possible combinations:
1. B E R _ Y → BER?  BERGY? Not a word.
2. C E R _ Y → CER?  CERGY? Not a word.
3. F E R _ Y → FER?  FERGY? Not a word.
4. G E R _ Y → GER?  GERRY? (GERRY is a name, not common)
5. H E R _ Y → HERRY? Not a word.
6. M E R _ Y → MER?  MERGY? Not a word.
7. V E R _ Y → V E R ?  V E R G Y? No.
8. W E R _ Y → W E R ?  W E R V Y? No.
9. C E R V Y → CERVY? Not a word.
10. F E R V Y → FERVY? Not a word.
11. B E R V Y → BERVY? Not a word.
12. C E R B Y → CERBY? Not a word.

Wait, let’s think of actual English words:
- ""CERBY"" – not valid
- ""FERRY"" – F E R R Y – but we have R already in position 3, and no info on duplicate R
- ""GERRY"" – name, not a common word
- ""MERGE"" – doesn’t end in Y
- ""BERGY"" – not a word
- ""VERGY"" – not a word
- ""WERGY"" – not a word
- ""SERGY"" – S is out
- ""PERGY"" – P is out

Actually, the only valid English word that fits _ E R _ Y with allowed letters is ""FERRY"" (F E R R Y). Even though it has two R's, the feedback doesn't rule out duplicates, and we have no information against it.

Let’s try FERRY.",Guess 5: FERRY -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) E(✓) R(✓) R(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
