### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should ideally include several of these.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has no repeated letters. This gives us maximum coverage of potential letters in the secret word.

Another strong candidate could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly more balanced in terms of vowel coverage and common consonants. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ O _ E
- It contains S somewhere, but not in position 4
- It does not contain A or R

We need a 5-letter word that fits _ _ O _ E and contains S (not in position 4). Possible positions for S: 1, 2, or 5. But position 5 is already E, so S must be in position 1 or 2.

Looking for words that fit:
- S _ O _ E: possible words like SOUSE, SLOPE, STOLE, etc.
- _ S O _ E: possible words like BSOKE (not valid), CSOME (not valid), DSOME (not valid), etc. Not many valid words here.

Valid words fitting S _ O _ E:
- SOUSE
- SLOPE
- STOLE
- STONE
- SHOBE (not valid)
- SMOKE (but M is not common, but it's valid)

Among these, ""STONE"" is a common word. Let's check:
- S T O N E
- O is in position 3 (correct)
- E is in position 5 (correct)
- S is in position 1 (not in position 4, so valid)
- T and N are new letters to test.

This seems like a good next guess to test T and N while confirming S is in position 1.
