For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

A good candidate is “POINT”:
- P – new consonant
- O – already confirmed in position 3

- O – fixed in position 3

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the correct (third) position.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So the secret word looks like: _ _ O _ _  
Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, E  
We still need to test common consonants and vowels.  
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, E, O are in/out status known).

Let’s pick a word that keeps O in the middle and introduces new common consonants and the remaining vowels.  
A good candidate is “POINT”:
- P – new consonant
- O – already confirmed in position 3
- I – new vowel
- N – new consonant
- T – new consonant

This tests 4 new letters (P, I, N, T) while keeping O fixed in place.

We need a word that:
1. Keeps O in the 3rd position.
2. Uses only the still-possible letters.
3. Introduces new consonants and the remaining vowel U to narrow things down quickly.

A good candidate is “CLOUD”:
- C – new consonant
- L – new consonant
- O – fixed in position 3
- U – the only remaining vowel
- D – new consonant

This tests 4 new letters while maintaining the known pattern.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (very common vowel)

This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, E, O are in/out status known).

Let’s pick a word that keeps O in the middle and introduces new common consonants and the remaining vowels.  
A good candidate is “POINT”:
- P – new consonant
- O – already confirmed in position 3
- I – new vowel
- N – new consonant
- T – new consonant

This tests 4 new letters (P, I, N, T) while keeping O fixed in place.

So far we know:
- The word is _ _ O _ _
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T
- Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the vowels we haven’t tried yet (only U is left among vowels)

We need a word that:
1. Keeps O in the 3rd position.
2. Uses only the still-possible letters.
3. Introduces new consonants and the remaining vowel U to narrow things down quickly.

A good candidate is “CLOUD”:
- C – new consonant
- L – new consonant
- O – fixed in position 3
- U – the only remaining vowel
- D – new consonant

This tests 4 new letters while maintaining the known pattern.

From the new feedback on CLOUD:

- O(✓) → O is still in the correct 3rd position.
- U(x) → U is not in the word.
- D(-) → D is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, L, U
- Letters that ARE in the word (but position unknown): D

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in the 3rd position.
2. Contains D somewhere other than the 5th position.
3. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.

Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus D is confirmed present).

Good candidates: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s pick a word that places D in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position while keeping O in 3rd. A simple choice is “DOGMA” but M and A are ruled out. Instead, let’s try “BODGY”:
- B – new consonant
- O – fixed in position 3
- D – confirmed present, placed in 2nd position
- G – new consonant
- Y – new consonant

This tests B, D, G, Y while keeping O in place and placing D in the 2nd position.

- G(x) → G is not in the word.
- Y(✓) → Y is in the word and in the 5th position.

So the pattern is: _ _ O _ Y  
Letters known to be in the word: D, Y (Y is fixed at 5th)  
Letters ruled out: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, L, U, B, G  
Remaining possible letters for positions 1, 2, 4: D, F, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z

We know D must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since it can't be in 3rd or 5th).  
Let’s try placing D in the 4th position: _ _ O D Y  
We need two more letters from the remaining set for positions 1 and 2.

A good candidate is ""MODYF"" but F hasn't been tested yet. However, ""MODYF"" isn't a valid word.  
Another option is ""FOXY"" but it's 4 letters.  
A valid word fitting _ _ O _ Y with D in 4th is ""HODY"" but again too short.  
Wait, we need 5 letters. Let's think of valid words ending in O _ Y with D in 4th:  
""MODGY"" – G is ruled out.  
""FOXY"" – 4 letters.  
""VODY"" – not a word.  
""HODY"" – not a word.  
""JODY"" – valid word: J-O-D-Y, but that's 4 letters.  
""WODY"" – not a word.  
""KODY"" – not a word.  
""ZODY"" – not a word.  
""XODY"" – not a word.  
""QODY"" – not a word.  
""FODY"" – valid word: F-O-D-Y, but again 4 letters.  

Hmm, seems like placing D in 4th is tricky. Let’s try D in 2nd position: _ D O _ Y  
We need a letter for position 1 from remaining: F, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z  
A valid word is ""VODDY"" but D is already in 2nd, and we can’t have two D’s unless the word allows it.  
""MODDY"" – same issue.  
""JODPY"" – not a word.  
""FODPY"" – not a word.  
""HODPY"" – not a word.  
""KODY"" – 4 letters.  
""VODY"" – 4 letters.  

Let’s try D in 1st position: D _ O _ Y  
We need a letter for position 2 from remaining: F, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z  
A valid word is ""DHYOL"" – but H and Y are allowed, but L is ruled out.  
""DFOXY"" – not a word.  
""DHODY"" – not a word.  
""DJODY"" – not a word.  
""DKODY"" – not a word.  
""DMODY"" – not a word.  
""DVODY"" – not a word.  
""DWODY"" – not a word.  
""DXODY"" – not a word.  
""DZODY"" – not a word.  

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words ending in O _ Y with D in 2nd or 1st or 4th and only using allowed letters.  
Looking at valid words ending in O _ Y:  
- ""FOXY"" – 4 letters.  
- ""HONEY"" – E is ruled out.  
- ""JODY"" – 4 letters.  
- ""KODY"" – 4 letters.  
- ""LLOYD"" – L is ruled out.  
- ""MODY"" – 4 letters.  
- ""NODDY"" – N is ruled out.  
- ""POMMY"" – P, M ruled out.  
- ""ROSY"" – R, S, Y ruled out.  
- ""SALTY"" – S, A, T ruled out.  
- ""TOMMY"" – T, M ruled out.  
- ""VODKY"" – K is allowed, but ""VODKY"" is a valid word (variant spelling of Vodka).  
""VODKY"" fits: V-O-D-K-Y  
- Position 1: V (allowed)  
- Position 2: O (fixed)  
- Position 3: D (allowed, not in 3rd position)  
- Position 4: K (allowed)  
- Position 5: Y (fixed)  

This seems valid. Let’s go with ""VODKY"".

Actually, ""HODDY"" – but D is already in 4th.  
""HODDY"" – H-O-D-D-Y – but we can't have two D's unless the word allows it, and ""HODDY"" is a valid word (variant spelling of ""hoddy"").  
""HODDY"" fits: H-O-D-D-Y  
- H is allowed (not ruled out)  
- O is fixed in 3rd  
- D appears twice, but we haven't ruled out double letters yet.  
This seems like the closest valid word fitting the constraints.

However, let's verify:  
Letters used: H, O, D, D, Y  
- H: allowed  
- O: fixed  
- D: allowed (must appear)

Wait, let's list valid 5-letter words ending in O D Y with allowed letters:  
- ""FOXYD"" – not a word.  
- ""HODY"" – 4 letters.  
- ""JODY"" – 4 letters.  
- ""MODY"" – 4 letters.  
- ""VODY"" – V is ruled out.  
- ""WODY"" – not a word.  
- ""XODY"" – not a word.  
- ""ZODY"" – not a word.  

This seems problematic. Let's reconsider the remaining letters and possible words.  
Looking at valid 5-letter words ending in O _ Y with D somewhere:  
- ""HONEY"" – E is ruled out.  
- ""MONEY"" – E, N ruled out.  
- ""POMMY"" – P, M ruled out.  
- ""SALTY"" – S, A, T ruled out.  
- ""TOMMY"" – T, M ruled out.  

Wait, let's try ""HODY"" – but it's 4 letters.  
Actually, ""HODDY"" – but D is already in 4th.  
""HODDY"" – H-O-D-D-Y – but we can't have two D's unless the word allows it, and ""HODDY"" is a valid word (variant spelling of ""hoddy"").  
""HODDY"" fits: H-O-D-D-Y  
- H is allowed (not ruled out)  
- O is fixed in 3rd  
- D appears twice, but we haven't ruled out double letters yet.  
This seems like the closest valid word fitting the constraints.

However, let's verify:  
Letters used: H, O, D, D, Y  
- H: allowed  
- O: fixed  
- D: allowed (must appear)  
- D: allowed (can repeat)  
- Y: fixed  

This seems valid. Let's go with ""HODDY"".",Guess 6: HODDY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) D(-) D(✓) Y(✓),FAIL
