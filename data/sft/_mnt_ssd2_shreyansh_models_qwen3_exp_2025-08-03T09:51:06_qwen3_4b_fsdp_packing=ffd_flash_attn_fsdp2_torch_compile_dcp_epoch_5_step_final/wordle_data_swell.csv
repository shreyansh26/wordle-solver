For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and can help eliminate many possibilities. Another good option is ""AROSE"" or ""ADIEU"". 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers vowels and common consonants, which should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x)
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E
- Does NOT contain A, R, O
- S is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5

Next guess should:
1. Include S and E
2. Avoid A, R, O
3. Place S somewhere other than position 4 and E somewhere other than position 5
4. Use other common letters not yet tested (T, N, L, I, U, etc.)

Current confirmed information:
- Word pattern: S _ E L _
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, I, N, H, F
- Letters confirmed in the word and in the correct positions: S (pos 1), E (pos 3), L (pos 4)

So we need to determine the 2nd and 5th letters.  
Available letters (excluding ruled-out ones): B, C, D, G, J, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, plus any others not yet tested.

Let's look for common 5-letter words that fit S _ E L _:
- S B E L L → ""SBE LL"" – not a valid word.
- S C E L L → ""SCELL"" – not a valid English word.
- S C E L L → ""S C E L L"" – invalid.
- S C E L L → ""S C E L L"" – invalid.
- S P E L L → but P would be in position 2 and L in position 5, but L is already in position 4.
- S W E L L → fits! Pattern: S W E L L. Letters: S, W, E, L, L.  
  - W and second L haven't been ruled out.
  - This is a valid English word.
