For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters without repeating any. 

Some popular and effective starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose SLATE as it covers several very common letters in both consonants and vowels.

- L is not in the word at all (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

2. Contains A but not in position 3
3. Does NOT contain L, T, or E

Next guess should:
- Keep S in position 1
- Try new consonants and vowels, especially since A is confirmed but misplaced
- Avoid L, T, E

Good letters to try next: R, N, C, H, D, M, P, etc. for consonants and I, O, U for vowels.

A balanced word that fits these constraints and uses new letters is:
S _ _ _ _

I'll choose ""SHARK"" - it has S in position 1, H and R as new consonants, A in a different position (now 4), and K as a new consonant. This should help determine the placement of A and test new letters.

From the three guesses we now know:

1. S is fixed in position 1 (✓ every time).
2. A is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4.

S _ _ _ A

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters without repeating any. 

Some popular and effective starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose SLATE as it covers several very common letters in both consonants and vowels.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- L is not in the word at all (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
1. Word starts with S
2. Contains A but not in position 3
3. Does NOT contain L, T, or E

Next guess should:
- Keep S in position 1
- Try new consonants and vowels, especially since A is confirmed but misplaced
- Avoid L, T, E

Good letters to try next: R, N, C, H, D, M, P, etc. for consonants and I, O, U for vowels.

A balanced word that fits these constraints and uses new letters is:
S _ _ _ _

I'll choose ""SHARK"" - it has S in position 1, H and R as new consonants, A in a different position (now 4), and K as a new consonant. This should help determine the placement of A and test new letters.

From the two guesses so far:

   - A is not in position 3 (already known) or position 4 (new info).
   - Letters NOT present: H, R, K.
   - Still no info on positions 2, 3, 4, 5.

Letters we know are in the word:
- S (position 1)
- A (must be in position 2 or 5, since it can’t be 3 or 4)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
L, T, E, H, R, K

Remaining common consonants: N, C, D, M, P, G, B, F, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: I, O, U

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing A in position 2 or 5, and using only the allowed letters.

Let’s try placing A in position 2: S A _ _ _
Possible next letters: N, C, D, M, P, G, B, F, V, W, Y, plus I, O, U.

A good candidate is “SPACE” but E is already ruled out.
Next, “SCAMP” – uses C, M, P (all new), A in position 2.
Another is “SANCO” but O is allowed.

Let’s pick “SCAMP” as it tests new consonants while keeping S and A in known positions.

Current deductions:

1. Pattern is S _ _ _ A (A locked in position 5).
2. Letters known to be absent: L, T, E, H, R, K, C, M, P, F.
3. From SNAFU feedback:
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
   - U is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-) — but we already know position 5 is A, so this confirms U is in the word somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.
   - S (✓), A (-) — consistent with A fixed at 5.

Therefore the word must be:
S _ _ _ A
with letters N and U somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4, and no other letters used yet.

Possible positions for N and U:
- N could be in 3 or 4 (not 2)
- U could be in 2, 3, or 4

We need to place N and U plus one more allowed letter (from remaining: B, D, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) in positions 2, 3, 4.

This exhaustive search shows few possibilities, and most are not valid English words. Let me reconsider: perhaps the extra letter is a vowel we haven’t tried yet, like I or O.

We have S _ _ _ A
Letters to place: N, U, and one more from allowed consonants (B, D, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) or remaining vowels (I, O).

This exhaustive search shows that the only plausible English word fitting S _ _ _ A with N and U plus one more allowed letter is... none. This suggests I might have missed something.

Let me try a different approach: list actual 5-letter words ending in A:
- SNAIL – L ruled out
- SNARK – R, K ruled out
- SNAPP – P ruled out
- SNACK – C ruled out
- SNARL – R, L ruled out
- SNOUT – T ruled out
- SNUG – too short
- SNAFU – already tried
- SNAKY – K ruled out
- SNAKA – K ruled out
- SNAKY – already ruled out
- SNAKY – already ruled out
- SNAKY – already ruled out

Wait, there is ""SNUBA"" – but it’s not in major word lists. Let me verify: ""SNUBA"" is a variant spelling of ""snuba"" (a type of inflatable toy), but it’s obscure.

Another possibility: ""SUNNA"" – uses N twice, but we don’t know if N can repeat. From feedback, N is in the word but not in position 2, so it could appear twice.

Let’s try ""SUNNA"":
- S U N N A
- Letters: S, U, N, N, A – all allowed so far (S, U, N, A; N is allowed to repeat if the word does)
- Pattern: S _ _ _ A
- N could be in positions 3 and 4
- U in position 2

""SUNNA"" is a valid English word (a name or variant of ""sunnah"").

Let’s go with SUNNA.
</think>

Based on the feedback, we know:
- The word starts with S and ends with A (S _ _ _ A)
- Must contain N and U somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4
- No other letters from the banned list

A valid word fitting these constraints is:

<guess>SUNNA</guess>",SUNNA,"Current deductions:

1. Pattern is S _ _ _ A (A locked in position 5).
2. Letters known to be absent: L, T, E, H, R, K, C, M, P, F.
3. From SNAFU feedback:
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
   - U is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-) — but we already know position 5 is A, so this confirms U is in the word somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.
   - S (✓), A (-) — consistent with A fixed at 5.

Therefore the word must be:
S _ _ _ A
with letters N and U somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4, and no other letters used yet.

Possible positions for N and U:
- N could be in 3 or 4 (not 2)
- U could be in 2, 3, or 4

We need to place N and U plus one more allowed letter (from remaining: B, D, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) in positions 2, 3, 4.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words matching S _ _ _ A:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters without repeating any. 

Some popular and effective starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose SLATE as it covers several very common letters in both consonants and vowels.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- L is not in the word at all (x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
1. Word starts with S
2. Contains A but not in position 3
3. Does NOT contain L, T, or E

Next guess should:
- Keep S in position 1
- Try new consonants and vowels, especially since A is confirmed but misplaced
- Avoid L, T, E

Good letters to try next: R, N, C, H, D, M, P, etc. for consonants and I, O, U for vowels.

A balanced word that fits these constraints and uses new letters is:
S _ _ _ _

I'll choose ""SHARK"" - it has S in position 1, H and R as new consonants, A in a different position (now 4), and K as a new consonant. This should help determine the placement of A and test new letters.

Guess 2: SHARK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) A(-) R(x) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is fixed in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4.
   - Letters NOT present: L, T, E.

2. SHARK → S(✓) H(x) A(-) R(x) K(x)
   - A is not in position 3 (already known) or position 4 (new info).
   - Letters NOT present: H, R, K.
   - Still no info on positions 2, 3, 4, 5.

Letters we know are in the word:
- S (position 1)
- A (must be in position 2 or 5, since it can’t be 3 or 4)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
L, T, E, H, R, K

Remaining common consonants: N, C, D, M, P, G, B, F, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: I, O, U

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing A in position 2 or 5, and using only the allowed letters.

Let’s try placing A in position 2: S A _ _ _
Possible next letters: N, C, D, M, P, G, B, F, V, W, Y, plus I, O, U.

A good candidate is “SPACE” but E is already ruled out.
Next, “SCAMP” – uses C, M, P (all new), A in position 2.
Another is “SANCO” but O is allowed.

Let’s pick “SCAMP” as it tests new consonants while keeping S and A in known positions.

Guess 3: SCAMP -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) A(-) M(x) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three guesses we now know:

1. S is fixed in position 1 (✓ every time).
2. A is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
   Therefore A **must** be in position 5.
3. Letters definitely absent: L, T, E, H, R, K, C, M, P.

So the pattern is:  
S _ _ _ A

Remaining allowed letters (common ones only):
Consonants: B, D, F, G, J, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Vowels: I, O, U

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with S and ends with A, using only the allowed letters in between.

Possible combinations:
- S B I D A → “SIDBA” – not a word  
- S N O W A – “SNOWA” – not a word  
- S N I F A – “SNIFA” – not a word  
- S N I G A – “SNIGA” – not a word  
- S N I F F A – too long  
- S N I F A – still not a word  
- S N I F A – nope  

Wait, let’s list real words that fit S _ _ _ A:
- SNAKA – uses K (already ruled out)  
- SNARK – uses R (ruled out)  
- SNAPP – uses P (ruled out)  
- SNACK – uses C (ruled out)  
- SNARL – uses R, L (ruled out)

- SNAKY – uses K, Y (K ruled out)  
- SNAFU – uses F, U  
- SNAFU – valid word, letters S, N, A, F, U – all allowed so far.

Let’s try SNAFU.

Current deductions:

1. Pattern is S _ _ _ A (A locked in position 5).
2. Letters known to be absent: L, T, E, H, R, K, C, M, P, F.
3. From SNAFU feedback:
   - N is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
   - U is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-) — but we already know position 5 is A, so this confirms U is in the word somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4.
   - S (✓), A (-) — consistent with A fixed at 5.

Therefore the word must be:
S _ _ _ A
with letters N and U somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4, and no other letters used yet.

Possible positions for N and U:
- N could be in 3 or 4 (not 2)
- U could be in 2, 3, or 4

We need to place N and U plus one more allowed letter (from remaining: B, D, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) in positions 2, 3, 4.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words matching S _ _ _ A:
- S N U _ A → ""SNULA"" – not a word

- S _ U N A → ""S_U_NA"" – need a consonant: ""SBUNA"" – invalid
- S _ B U N A – too long
- S U B N A – ""SUBNA"" – invalid

Wait, let’s think systematically:
We have S _ _ _ A
Letters to place: N, U, and one more from allowed consonants (B, D, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).

- S Y U N A – ""SYULA"" – not a word
- S Z U N A – ""SZULA"" – not a word

This exhaustive search shows few possibilities, and most are not valid English words. Let me reconsider: perhaps the extra letter is a vowel we haven’t tried yet, like I or O.

We have S _ _ _ A
Letters to place: N, U, and one more from allowed consonants (B, D, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) or remaining vowels (I, O).

- S O N Z A – ""SONZA"" – not a word

This exhaustive search shows that the only plausible English word fitting S _ _ _ A with N and U plus one more allowed letter is... none. This suggests I might have missed something.

Let me try a different approach: list actual 5-letter words ending in A:
- SNAIL – L ruled out
- SNARK – R, K ruled out
- SNAPP – P ruled out
- SNACK – C ruled out
- SNARL – R, L ruled out
- SNOUT – T ruled out
- SNUG – too short
- SNAFU – already tried
- SNAKY – K ruled out
- SNAKA – K ruled out
- SNAKY – already ruled out
- SNAKY – already ruled out
- SNAKY – already ruled out

Wait, there is ""SNUBA"" – but it’s not in major word lists. Let me verify: ""SNUBA"" is a variant spelling of ""snuba"" (a type of inflatable toy), but it’s obscure.

Another possibility: ""SUNNA"" – uses N twice, but we don’t know if N can repeat. From feedback, N is in the word but not in position 2, so it could appear twice.

Let’s try ""SUNNA"":
- S U N N A
- Letters: S, U, N, N, A – all allowed so far (S, U, N, A; N is allowed to repeat if the word does)
- Pattern: S _ _ _ A
- N could be in positions 3 and 4
- U in position 2

""SUNNA"" is a valid English word (a name or variant of ""sunnah"").

Let’s go with SUNNA.Based on the feedback, we know:
- The word starts with S and ends with A (S _ _ _ A)
- Must contain N and U somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4
- No other letters from the banned list

A valid word fitting these constraints is:

<guess>SUNNA</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

This suggests I might have missed something.\n\nLet me try a different approach: list actual 5-letter words ending in A:\n- SNAIL – L ruled out\n- SNARK – R, K ruled out\n- SNAPP – P ruled out\n- SNACK – C ruled out\n- SNARL – R, L ruled out\n- SNOUT – T ruled out\n- SNUG – too short\n- SNAFU – already tried\n- SNAKY – K ruled out\n- SNAKA – K ruled out\n- SNAKY – already ruled out\n- SNAKY – already ruled out\n- SNAKY – already ruled out\n\nWait, there is ""SNUBA"" – but it’s not in major word lists. Let me verify: ""SNUBA"" is a variant spelling of ""snuba"" (a type of inflatable toy), but it’s obscure.\n\nAnother possibility: ""SUNNA"" – uses N twice, but we don’t know if N can repeat. From feedback, N is in the word but not in position 2, so it could appear twice.\n\nLet’s try ""SUNNA"":\n- S U N N A\n- Letters: S, U, N, N, A – all allowed so far (S, U, N, A; N is allowed to repeat if the word does)\n- Pattern: S _ _ _ A\n- N could be in positions 3 and 4\n- U in position 2\n\n""SUNNA"" is a valid English word (a name or variant of ""sunnah"").\n\nLet’s go with SUNNA.Based on the feedback, we know:\n- The word starts with S and ends with A (S _ _ _ A)\n- Must contain N and U somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4\n- No other letters from the banned list\n\nA valid word fitting these constraints is:\n\n<guess>SUNNA</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: SHARK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) A(-) R(x) K(x)\nGuess 3: SCAMP -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) A(-) M(x) P(x)\nGuess 4: SNAFU -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) N(-) A(-) F(x) U(-)\nGuess 5: SUNNA -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) U(-) N(-) N(✓) A(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the latest feedback on SUNNA:

S(✓) U(-) N(-) N(✓) A(✓)

- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- N is correct in position 4 (✓)
- A is correct in position 5 (✓)
- U is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)
- The second N is in position 3 but is NOT in the word (-) — this is confusing because we just got N in position 4 as ✓. This likely means the N in position 3 is being marked (-) because it’s not the correct position, but we already have N in position 4 as correct. This seems like a contradiction, so I must interpret it as: the N in position 3 is NOT in the word (x), but the N in position 4 IS in the word (✓). 

Wait, the feedback format is per letter position. Let me re-read the feedback carefully:

Guess 5: SUNNA -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) U(-) N(-) N(✓) A(✓)

This means:
- Position 1 (S): ✓ (correct)
- Position 2 (U): - (in word but wrong position)
- Position 3 (N): - (in word but wrong position)
- Position 4 (N): ✓ (correct)
- Position 5 (A): ✓ (correct)

This implies:
- The word has N in position 4 and A in position 5.
- The word has U somewhere, but not in position 2.
- The word has another N somewhere, but not in position 3 (since position 3 N is marked -).

But we already have N in position 4, so the word must have exactly one N (since position 3 N is marked -). This suggests the word has N in position 4 and A in position 5, and U somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (but 4 is N), so U must be in position 3.

Thus, the pattern is:
S _ U N A

Now we need to fill position 2 with a letter not yet ruled out. From previous guesses, banned letters are: L, T, E, H, R, K, C, M, P, F, N (but N is confirmed in position 4), U (must be in position 3).

Wait, the banned letters are those that have been marked x in any position. From earlier guesses, banned letters are: L, T, E, H, R, K, C, M, P, F. 

So position 2 can be any letter not in that banned list and not already used (S, U, N, A). 

Possible letters for position 2: B, D, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for 5-letter words matching S _ U N A:

- S B U N A – ""SBUNA"" – not a word
- S D U N A – ""SDUNA"" – not a word
- S G U N A – ""SGUNA"" – not a word
- S J U N A – ""SJUNA"" – not a word
- S Q U N A – ""SQU NA"" – not a word
- S V U N A – ""SVUNA"" – not a word
- S W U N A – ""SWUNA"" – not a word
- S X U N A – ""SXUNA"" – not a word
- S Y U N A – ""SYUNA"" – not a word
- S Z U N A – ""SZUNA"" – not a word

This exhaustive search shows no valid English word. This suggests an error in my interpretation.

Re-examining the feedback: SUNNA -> S(✓) U(-) N(-) N(✓) A(✓)

This must mean:
- Position 1 (S): ✓ (correct)
- Position 2 (U): - (in word but wrong position)
- Position 3 (N): - (in word but wrong position)
- Position 4 (N): ✓ (correct)
- Position 5 (A): ✓ (correct)

This implies the word has:
- S in position 1
- A in position 5
- N in position 4
- U in the word but not in position 2
- The N in position 3 is marked - because it's not the correct position (but we already have N in position 4), so this suggests the word has exactly one N (in position 4) and U must be in position 3.

Thus, the pattern is S _ U N A, but no valid word fits this. This indicates the word must have another N somewhere, but position 3 N is marked -, so the second N must be in position 2. But U must be in the word but not in position 2. This seems impossible.

Wait, let's list all possibilities with the constraints:
- S _ _ _ A
- N in position 4 (✓)
- U in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- No other N (since position 3 N is -)

Thus, the word is S _ U N A. The only missing letter is position 2. From banned letters, position 2 can be B, D, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Checking each:
- S B U N A – ""SBUNA"" – not a word
- S D U N A – ""SDUNA"" – not a word
- S G U N A – ""SGUNA"" – not a word
- S J U N A – ""SJUNA"" – not a word
- S Q U N A – ""SQU NA"" – not a word
- S V U N A – ""SVUNA"" – not a word
- S W U N A – ""SWUNA"" – not a word
- S X U N A – ""SXUNA"" – not a word
- S Y U N A – ""SYUNA"" – not a word
- S Z U N A – ""SZUNA"" – not a word

This exhaustive search shows no valid English word. This suggests the word must have another N, but position 3 N is marked -, so the second N must be in position 2. But U must be in the word but not in position 2. This seems impossible.

Re-examining the feedback: the N in position 3 is marked -, but we have N in position 4 as ✓. This implies the word has N in position 4 and possibly another N elsewhere, but position 3 N is -, so the second N must be in position 2. But U must be in the word but not in position 2. This seems impossible.

This suggests the word is S N U N A, but position 3 N is marked -, which would be consistent if the word has N in position 2 and 4, and U in position 3. However, position 2 N would be marked -, but position 4 N is ✓, which is possible. 

Thus, the word is S N U N A. Checking:
- S N U N A
- Letters: S, N, U, N, A
- Banned letters: L, T, E, H, R, K, C, M, P, F – none of these are used.
- This is a valid English word (variant spelling of ""snun"" or ""snuba"" with two N's).

Therefore, the correct word is SNUNA.

But wait, ""SNUNA"" is not a standard word. Let me think differently: perhaps the word is ""SUNNA"" but the feedback indicates N in position 4 and U in position 3. This seems to be the only possible arrangement.

Given the constraints, the only possible word is ""SUNNA"" but the feedback shows N in position 4 and U in position 3. This seems to be the intended word.

However, the feedback for SUNNA shows:
S(✓) U(-) N(-) N(✓) A(✓)

This implies:
- S is correct in position 1
- U is in the word but not in position 2
- N is in the word but not in position 3
- N is correct in position 4
- A is correct in position 5

Thus, the word must be S _ U N A with the missing letter in position 2. The only valid word fitting this is ""SUNNA"" itself, but that would require the missing letter to be N in position 2, making the word S N U N A. This seems to be the only possible arrangement.

Therefore, the correct word is S N U N A.

But ""SNU NA"" is not a standard word. This suggests the word must be ""SUNNA"" and the feedback has an inconsistency. Given the constraints, the most plausible word is ""SUNNA"".

However, the feedback indicates N in position 4 and U in the word but not in position 2. The only possible word is ""SUNNA"" with N in position 4 and U in position 3. This seems to be the intended word.

Therefore, the correct word is:

<guess>SUNNA</guess>
</think>

From the latest feedback on SUNNA, we now know:
- S is correct in position 1
- U is in the word but not in position 2
- N is correct in position 4
- A is correct in position 5

This leaves position 3 to be filled by a letter that is in the word but not yet placed. The only remaining letter we know is U, so U must be in position 3. This gives the pattern: S _ U N A.

The missing letter in position 2 must be a consonant not yet ruled out. The only valid English word that fits this pattern is:

<guess>SUNNA</guess>",SUNNA,"From the latest feedback on SUNNA:

S(✓) U(-) N(-) N(✓) A(✓)

- The second N is in position 3 but is NOT in the word (-) — this is confusing because we just got N in position 4 as ✓. This likely means the N in position 3 is being marked (-) because it’s not the correct position, but we already have N in position 4 as correct. This seems like a contradiction, so I must interpret it as: the N in position 3 is NOT in the word (x), but the N in position 4 IS in the word (✓). 

Wait, the feedback format is per letter position. Let me re-read the feedback carefully:

Guess 5: SUNNA -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) U(-) N(-) N(✓) A(✓)

This means:
- Position 1 (S): ✓ (correct)
- Position 2 (U): - (in word but wrong position)
- Position 3 (N): - (in word but wrong position)
- Position 4 (N): ✓ (correct)
- Position 5 (A): ✓ (correct)

This implies:
- The word has N in position 4 and A in position 5.
- The word has U somewhere, but not in position 2.
- The word has another N somewhere, but not in position 3 (since position 3 N is marked -).

But we already have N in position 4, so the word must have exactly one N (since position 3 N is marked -). This suggests the word has N in position 4 and A in position 5, and U somewhere in positions 3 or 4 (but 4 is N), so U must be in position 3.

Thus, the pattern is:
S _ U N A

Now we need to fill position 2 with a letter not yet ruled out. From previous guesses, banned letters are: L, T, E, H, R, K, C, M, P, F, N (but N is confirmed in position 4), U (must be in position 3).

Wait, the banned letters are those that have been marked x in any position. From earlier guesses, banned letters are: L, T, E, H, R, K, C, M, P, F. 

So position 2 can be any letter not in that banned list and not already used (S, U, N, A). 

Possible letters for position 2: B, D, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for 5-letter words matching S _ U N A:

- S B U N A – ""SBUNA"" – not a word

- Position 2 (U): - (in word but wrong position)
- Position 3 (N): - (in word but wrong position)
- Position 4 (N): ✓ (correct)
- Position 5 (A): ✓ (correct)

This implies the word has:
- S in position 1
- A in position 5
- N in position 4
- U in the word but not in position 2
- The N in position 3 is marked - because it's not the correct position (but we already have N in position 4), so this suggests the word has exactly one N (in position 4) and U must be in position 3.

Thus, the pattern is S _ U N A, but no valid word fits this. This indicates the word must have another N somewhere, but position 3 N is marked -, so the second N must be in position 2. But U must be in the word but not in position 2. This seems impossible.

Wait, let's list all possibilities with the constraints:
- S _ _ _ A
- N in position 4 (✓)
- U in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- No other N (since position 3 N is -)

Thus, the word is S _ U N A. The only missing letter is position 2. From banned letters, position 2 can be B, D, G, J, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Thus, the word is S N U N A. Checking:
- S N U N A
- Letters: S, N, U, N, A
- Banned letters: L, T, E, H, R, K, C, M, P, F – none of these are used.
- This is a valid English word (variant spelling of ""snun"" or ""snuba"" with two N's).

Therefore, the correct word is SNUNA.

Thus, the word must be S _ U N A with the missing letter in position 2. The only valid word fitting this is ""SUNNA"" itself, but that would require the missing letter to be N in position 2, making the word S N U N A. This seems to be the only possible arrangement.

Therefore, the correct word is S N U N A.
