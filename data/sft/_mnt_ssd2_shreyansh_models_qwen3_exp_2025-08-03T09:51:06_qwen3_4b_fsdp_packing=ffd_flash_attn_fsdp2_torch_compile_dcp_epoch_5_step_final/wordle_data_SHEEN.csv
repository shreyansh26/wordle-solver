### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This gives us a high chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word right away, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O are NOT in the word (x).
- S and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has S and E in positions different from AROSE (i.e., S not in 4th, E not in 5th).
2. Does not contain A, R, O.

Good letters to include next: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc.

A strong candidate is ""STEIN"":
- S is in position 1 (was in 4, so new position).
- E is in position 2 (was in 5, so new position).
- Contains no A, R, O.
- Uses common letters T, I, N.

Let's check:
STEIN: S(-) T(?) E(-) I(?) N(?)
This should give us new positions for S and E, plus info on T, I, N.

- Valid English word (means “the appearance of something”).
