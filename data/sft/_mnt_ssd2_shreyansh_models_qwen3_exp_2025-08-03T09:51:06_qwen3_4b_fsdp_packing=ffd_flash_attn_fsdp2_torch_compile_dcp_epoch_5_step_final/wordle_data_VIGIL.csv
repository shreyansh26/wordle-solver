### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word.

Some popular first guesses are words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". These words contain multiple vowels and common consonants. I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it has three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should provide good coverage for the first guess.

All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every word that contains any of those five letters.  
To maximize information in the next guess, I’ll pick a word that uses entirely different letters, ideally covering other high-frequency consonants and vowels.  
A good candidate is “UNTIL”: it contains U, N, T, I, L — none of which were in AROSE, and it hits several common letters that might appear in the secret word.  
Another strong choice would be “CHIMP” or “BLIMP,” but “UNTIL” feels slightly more balanced for first-time feedback.  
I’ll go with “UNTIL.”

We now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T  
- Letters IN the word and in the correct positions: I (4th) and L (5th)  
- So the secret word ends in “IL” and has three other letters that must come from the remaining alphabet (excluding the eliminated set).

Common remaining consonants include D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Vowels left: I, Y (Y sometimes acts as a vowel).  
We need three new letters that haven’t been tried yet.

A good next guess should introduce several fresh, high-frequency letters while respecting the fixed ending “IL”.  
Candidate words:
- “WHILM” – but W and H are okay, M is okay, but it’s less common.  
- “CHIMP” – C, H, M, P are all unused.  
- “BLIMP” – B, L, M, P; L is already confirmed, so this is valid.  
- “GIMPY” – G, M, P, Y; ends in PY, which conflicts with known IL.  
- “DILLY” – D, L, L, Y; ends in LY, again conflicting.  
- “FILMY” – F, L, M, Y; ends in MY, conflicting.  
- “WIMPY” – same issue with ending.  

Best fit: “CHIMP” – letters C, H, M, P are all new and high-frequency, and the ending “MP” is compatible with the known “IL” (though it doesn’t test the ending directly; we’ll get more info from the feedback).

Wait – the known ending is “IL”, so any guess must end in “IL”.  
So the structure is _ _ _ I L.  
That changes things: the first three letters must be from the remaining alphabet, and the last two are locked.  
So we need three new letters for positions 1-3, none of which can be A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T.  

Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I (already used), Y (sometimes vowel).  

We need three distinct letters from the remaining set.  
Possible combinations:  
- B, C, D → “BCDIL” – not a word.  
- C, H, M → “CHMIL” – not a word.  
- D, I, L – but I and L are fixed.  
- F, I, L – same.  
- G, I, L – same.  
- H, I, L – same.  
- K, I, L – same.  
- M, I, L – same.  
- P, I, L – same.  
- V, I, L – same.  
- W, I, L – same.  

We need real 5-letter words ending in “IL”.  
Real words ending in “IL”:  
- “WILL” – only 4 letters.  
- “FILMY” – ends in “MY”.  
- “HILAR” – ends in “AR”.  
- “TILDA” – ends in “DA”.  
- “GILTS” – ends in “TS”.  
- “DILTS” – ends in “TS”.  
- “CILIA” – ends in “IA”.  
- “MILCH” – ends in “CH”.  
- “PILCH” – ends in “CH”.  
- “WILDS” – ends in “DS”.  
- “DILLY” – ends in “LY”.  
- “FILLY” – ends in “LY”.  
- “GILLY” – ends in “LY”.  
- “HILLY” – ends in “LY”.  
- “MILLY” – ends in “LY”.  
- “PILLY” – ends in “LY”.  
- “SILLY” – ends in “LY” (but S is eliminated).  
- “TILLY” – ends in “LY” (T is eliminated).  
- “WILLY” – ends in “LY” (W is okay, but T is eliminated, so W is allowed).  

Looking through these, the only remaining common words ending in “IL” that use new letters are:  
- “WILLY” – W, I, L, L, Y.  
- “MILLY” – M, I, L, L, Y.  
- “PILLY” – P, I, L, L, Y.  
- “FILLY” – F, I, L, L, Y.  
- “DILLY” – D, I, L, L, Y.  
- “GILLY” – G, I, L, L, Y.  
- “HILLY” – H, I, L, L, Y.  

Among these, “WILLY” uses W, L, Y – but L is already confirmed in position 5.  
Similarly, “MILLY” uses M, L, Y – but L is already in position 5.  
The first three letters must be new.  

Looking for words with distinct first three letters ending in “IL”:  
- “WIMIL” – not a word.  
- “CHIMB” – not ending in “IL”.  
- “BILLY” – B, I, L, L, Y – B is new, but I and L are fixed.  
- “DILLY” – D is new.  
- “FILLY” – F is new.  
- “GILLY” – G is new.  
- “HILLY” – H is new.  
- “PILLY” – P is new.  
- “WILLY” – W is new.  

The most common among these is “WILLY” (though it repeats L twice).  
Another is “BILLY”.  
A less common but valid word is “WIMIL” – but it’s not standard.  
Another possibility is “CHIMB” – but it doesn’t end in “IL”.  

Upon reflection, the simplest valid 5-letter word ending in “IL” with new letters is “WILLY” (W, I, L, L, Y).  
But since L is already fixed in position 5, the word must be _ _ _ I L.  
So the first three letters must be new.  
Real words ending in “IL” with distinct first three letters:  
- “WIMIL” – not valid.  
- “CHIMB” – not ending in “IL”.  
- “BILLY” – B, I, L, L, Y – B is new, but L repeats.  
- “DILLY” – D, I, L, L, Y – D is new.  
- “FILLY” – F, I, L, L, Y – F is new.  
- “GILLY” – G, I, L, L, Y – G is new.  
- “HILLY” – H, I, L, L, Y – H is new.  
- “PILLY” – P, I, L, L, Y – P is new.  
- “WILLY” – W, I, L, L, Y – W is new.  

The most straightforward choice is “WILLY” (W, I, L, L, Y).  
It introduces W and Y as new letters, and we already know I and L are in their correct positions.  

Therefore, the next guess should be “WILLY”.

- “WIMIL” – not valid.  
- “CHIMB” – not ending in “IL”.  
- “BILLY” – B, I, L, L, Y – B is new, but L repeats.  
- “DILLY” – D, I, L, L, Y – D is new.  
- “FILLY” – F, I, L, L, Y – F is new.  
- “GILLY” – G, I, L, L, Y – G is new.  
- “HILLY” – H, I, L, L, Y – H is new.  
- “PILLY” – P, I, L, L, Y – P is new.  
- “WILLY” – W, I, L, L, Y – W is new.  

The most straightforward choice is “WILLY” (W, I, L, L, Y).  
It introduces W and Y as new letters, and we already know I and L are in their correct positions.  

Therefore, the next guess should be “WILLY”.",Guess 3: WILLY -> FEEDBACK: W(x) I(✓) L(-) L(-) Y(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word.

Some popular first guesses are words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". These words contain multiple vowels and common consonants. I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it has three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should provide good coverage for the first guess.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every word that contains any of those five letters.  
To maximize information in the next guess, I’ll pick a word that uses entirely different letters, ideally covering other high-frequency consonants and vowels.  
A good candidate is “UNTIL”: it contains U, N, T, I, L — none of which were in AROSE, and it hits several common letters that might appear in the secret word.  
Another strong choice would be “CHIMP” or “BLIMP,” but “UNTIL” feels slightly more balanced for first-time feedback.  
I’ll go with “UNTIL.”

We now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T  
- Letters IN the word and in the correct positions: I (4th) and L (5th)  
- So the secret word ends in “IL” and has three other letters that must come from the remaining alphabet (excluding the eliminated set).

Common remaining consonants include D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Vowels left: I, Y (Y sometimes acts as a vowel).  
We need three new letters that haven’t been tried yet.

A good next guess should introduce several fresh, high-frequency letters while respecting the fixed ending “IL”.  
Candidate words:
- “WHILM” – but W and H are okay, M is okay, but it’s less common.  
- “CHIMP” – C, H, M, P are all unused.  
- “BLIMP” – B, L, M, P; L is already confirmed, so this is valid.  
- “GIMPY” – G, M, P, Y; ends in PY, which conflicts with known IL.  
- “DILLY” – D, L, L, Y; ends in LY, again conflicting.  
- “FILMY” – F, L, M, Y; ends in MY, conflicting.  
- “WIMPY” – same issue with ending.  

Best fit: “CHIMP” – letters C, H, M, P are all new and high-frequency, and the ending “MP” is compatible with the known “IL” (though it doesn’t test the ending directly; we’ll get more info from the feedback).

Wait – the known ending is “IL”, so any guess must end in “IL”.  
So the structure is _ _ _ I L.  
That changes things: the first three letters must be from the remaining alphabet, and the last two are locked.  
So we need three new letters for positions 1-3, none of which can be A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T.  

Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I (already used), Y (sometimes vowel).  

We need three distinct letters from the remaining set.  
Possible combinations:  
- B, C, D → “BCDIL” – not a word.  
- C, H, M → “CHMIL” – not a word.  
- D, I, L – but I and L are fixed.  
- F, I, L – same.  
- G, I, L – same.  
- H, I, L – same.  
- K, I, L – same.  
- M, I, L – same.  
- P, I, L – same.  
- V, I, L – same.  
- W, I, L – same.  

We need real 5-letter words ending in “IL”.  
Real words ending in “IL”:  
- “WILL” – only 4 letters.  
- “FILMY” – ends in “MY”.  
- “HILAR” – ends in “AR”.  
- “TILDA” – ends in “DA”.  
- “GILTS” – ends in “TS”.  
- “DILTS” – ends in “TS”.  
- “CILIA” – ends in “IA”.  
- “MILCH” – ends in “CH”.  
- “PILCH” – ends in “CH”.  
- “WILDS” – ends in “DS”.  
- “DILLY” – ends in “LY”.  
- “FILLY” – ends in “LY”.  
- “GILLY” – ends in “LY”.  
- “HILLY” – ends in “LY”.  
- “MILLY” – ends in “LY”.  
- “PILLY” – ends in “LY”.  
- “SILLY” – ends in “LY” (but S is eliminated).  
- “TILLY” – ends in “LY” (T is eliminated).  
- “WILLY” – ends in “LY” (W is okay, but T is eliminated, so W is allowed).  

Looking through these, the only remaining common words ending in “IL” that use new letters are:  
- “WILLY” – W, I, L, L, Y.  
- “MILLY” – M, I, L, L, Y.  
- “PILLY” – P, I, L, L, Y.  
- “FILLY” – F, I, L, L, Y.  
- “DILLY” – D, I, L, L, Y.  
- “GILLY” – G, I, L, L, Y.  
- “HILLY” – H, I, L, L, Y.  

Among these, “WILLY” uses W, L, Y – but L is already confirmed in position 5.  
Similarly, “MILLY” uses M, L, Y – but L is already in position 5.  
The first three letters must be new.  

Looking for words with distinct first three letters ending in “IL”:  
- “WIMIL” – not a word.  
- “CHIMB” – not ending in “IL”.  
- “BILLY” – B, I, L, L, Y – B is new, but I and L are fixed.  
- “DILLY” – D is new.  
- “FILLY” – F is new.  
- “GILLY” – G is new.  
- “HILLY” – H is new.  
- “PILLY” – P is new.  
- “WILLY” – W is new.  

The most common among these is “WILLY” (though it repeats L twice).  
Another is “BILLY”.  
A less common but valid word is “WIMIL” – but it’s not standard.  
Another possibility is “CHIMB” – but it doesn’t end in “IL”.  

Upon reflection, the simplest valid 5-letter word ending in “IL” with new letters is “WILLY” (W, I, L, L, Y).  
But since L is already fixed in position 5, the word must be _ _ _ I L.  
So the first three letters must be new.  
Real words ending in “IL” with distinct first three letters:  
- “WIMIL” – not valid.  
- “CHIMB” – not ending in “IL”.  
- “BILLY” – B, I, L, L, Y – B is new, but L repeats.  
- “DILLY” – D, I, L, L, Y – D is new.  
- “FILLY” – F, I, L, L, Y – F is new.  
- “GILLY” – G, I, L, L, Y – G is new.  
- “HILLY” – H, I, L, L, Y – H is new.  
- “PILLY” – P, I, L, L, Y – P is new.  
- “WILLY” – W, I, L, L, Y – W is new.  

The most straightforward choice is “WILLY” (W, I, L, L, Y).  
It introduces W and Y as new letters, and we already know I and L are in their correct positions.  

Therefore, the next guess should be “WILLY”.

Let’s update what we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word:  
   A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, W, Y

2. Letters that ARE in the word and their known positions:
   - I is in position 4 (✓)
   - L is in the word, but **not** in positions 3 or 5 (because L got “-” in positions 3 and 5 in WILLY).  
     So L must be in position 1, 2, or 4.  
     But position 4 is already I, so L must be in position 1 or 2.

3. Word pattern so far:  
   _ _ _ I _   (with L somewhere in position 1 or 2)

4. Remaining unused common letters (excluding the eliminated set):  
   Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Z  
   Vowels: I (already placed), sometimes Y (but Y is out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
   - Ends in I _  (positions 4 and 5 must be I and something else)  
   - Contains L exactly once (since L appeared once in WILLY and was marked “-”)  
   - Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Possible patterns:  
   L _ _ I _   or   _ L _ I _

Let’s brainstorm real words that fit:
   - L _ _ I _:  
     LIMIX – not a word  
     LIVID – V is unused, D is unused → LIVID is valid  
     LIMPY – Y is out  
     LIRIC – R is out  
     LIVOR – O is out  
     LIVID seems to fit.

   - _ L _ I _:  
     FLICK – C is unused, K is unused → FLICK is valid  
     BLICK – B is unused  
     CLINK – N is out  
     PLINK – P is unused, but N is out in K  
     SLINK – S is out  
     DLICK – not a word  
     GLICK – G is unused  
     PLI… no common words.

Between LIVID and FLICK, LIVID uses I, V, I, D – but I is already in position 4.  
FLICK uses F, L, I, C, K – all letters are new or already confirmed.

FLICK introduces F, L, I, C, K.  
LIVID introduces L, I, V, I, D – but repeats I and uses V.  
FLICK seems better because it adds four new letters (F, L, C, K) while respecting all constraints.

So the next guess is FLICK.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word.

Some popular first guesses are words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". These words contain multiple vowels and common consonants. I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it has three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should provide good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every word that contains any of those five letters.  
To maximize information in the next guess, I’ll pick a word that uses entirely different letters, ideally covering other high-frequency consonants and vowels.  
A good candidate is “UNTIL”: it contains U, N, T, I, L — none of which were in AROSE, and it hits several common letters that might appear in the secret word.  
Another strong choice would be “CHIMP” or “BLIMP,” but “UNTIL” feels slightly more balanced for first-time feedback.  
I’ll go with “UNTIL.”

We now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T  
- Letters IN the word and in the correct positions: I (4th) and L (5th)  
- So the secret word ends in “IL” and has three other letters that must come from the remaining alphabet (excluding the eliminated set).

Common remaining consonants include D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Vowels left: I, Y (Y sometimes acts as a vowel).  
We need three new letters that haven’t been tried yet.

A good next guess should introduce several fresh, high-frequency letters while respecting the fixed ending “IL”.  
Candidate words:
- “WHILM” – but W and H are okay, M is okay, but it’s less common.  
- “CHIMP” – C, H, M, P are all unused.  
- “BLIMP” – B, L, M, P; L is already confirmed, so this is valid.  
- “GIMPY” – G, M, P, Y; ends in PY, which conflicts with known IL.  
- “DILLY” – D, L, L, Y; ends in LY, again conflicting.  
- “FILMY” – F, L, M, Y; ends in MY, conflicting.  
- “WIMPY” – same issue with ending.  

Best fit: “CHIMP” – letters C, H, M, P are all new and high-frequency, and the ending “MP” is compatible with the known “IL” (though it doesn’t test the ending directly; we’ll get more info from the feedback).

Wait – the known ending is “IL”, so any guess must end in “IL”.  
So the structure is _ _ _ I L.  
That changes things: the first three letters must be from the remaining alphabet, and the last two are locked.  
So we need three new letters for positions 1-3, none of which can be A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T.  

Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I (already used), Y (sometimes vowel).  

We need three distinct letters from the remaining set.  
Possible combinations:  
- B, C, D → “BCDIL” – not a word.  
- C, H, M → “CHMIL” – not a word.  
- D, I, L – but I and L are fixed.  
- F, I, L – same.  
- G, I, L – same.  
- H, I, L – same.  
- K, I, L – same.  
- M, I, L – same.  
- P, I, L – same.  
- V, I, L – same.  
- W, I, L – same.  

We need real 5-letter words ending in “IL”.  
Real words ending in “IL”:  
- “WILL” – only 4 letters.  
- “FILMY” – ends in “MY”.  
- “HILAR” – ends in “AR”.  
- “TILDA” – ends in “DA”.  
- “GILTS” – ends in “TS”.  
- “DILTS” – ends in “TS”.  
- “CILIA” – ends in “IA”.  
- “MILCH” – ends in “CH”.  
- “PILCH” – ends in “CH”.  
- “WILDS” – ends in “DS”.  
- “DILLY” – ends in “LY”.  
- “FILLY” – ends in “LY”.  
- “GILLY” – ends in “LY”.  
- “HILLY” – ends in “LY”.  
- “MILLY” – ends in “LY”.  
- “PILLY” – ends in “LY”.  
- “SILLY” – ends in “LY” (but S is eliminated).  
- “TILLY” – ends in “LY” (T is eliminated).  
- “WILLY” – ends in “LY” (W is okay, but T is eliminated, so W is allowed).  

Looking through these, the only remaining common words ending in “IL” that use new letters are:  
- “WILLY” – W, I, L, L, Y.  
- “MILLY” – M, I, L, L, Y.  
- “PILLY” – P, I, L, L, Y.  
- “FILLY” – F, I, L, L, Y.  
- “DILLY” – D, I, L, L, Y.  
- “GILLY” – G, I, L, L, Y.  
- “HILLY” – H, I, L, L, Y.  

Among these, “WILLY” uses W, L, Y – but L is already confirmed in position 5.  
Similarly, “MILLY” uses M, L, Y – but L is already in position 5.  
The first three letters must be new.  

Looking for words with distinct first three letters ending in “IL”:  
- “WIMIL” – not a word.  
- “CHIMB” – not ending in “IL”.  
- “BILLY” – B, I, L, L, Y – B is new, but I and L are fixed.  
- “DILLY” – D is new.  
- “FILLY” – F is new.  
- “GILLY” – G is new.  
- “HILLY” – H is new.  
- “PILLY” – P is new.  
- “WILLY” – W is new.  

The most common among these is “WILLY” (though it repeats L twice).  
Another is “BILLY”.  
A less common but valid word is “WIMIL” – but it’s not standard.  
Another possibility is “CHIMB” – but it doesn’t end in “IL”.  

Upon reflection, the simplest valid 5-letter word ending in “IL” with new letters is “WILLY” (W, I, L, L, Y).  
But since L is already fixed in position 5, the word must be _ _ _ I L.  
So the first three letters must be new.  
Real words ending in “IL” with distinct first three letters:  
- “WIMIL” – not valid.  
- “CHIMB” – not ending in “IL”.  
- “BILLY” – B, I, L, L, Y – B is new, but L repeats.  
- “DILLY” – D, I, L, L, Y – D is new.  
- “FILLY” – F, I, L, L, Y – F is new.  
- “GILLY” – G, I, L, L, Y – G is new.  
- “HILLY” – H, I, L, L, Y – H is new.  
- “PILLY” – P, I, L, L, Y – P is new.  
- “WILLY” – W, I, L, L, Y – W is new.  

The most straightforward choice is “WILLY” (W, I, L, L, Y).  
It introduces W and Y as new letters, and we already know I and L are in their correct positions.  

Therefore, the next guess should be “WILLY”.

Let’s update what we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word:  
   A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, W, Y

2. Letters that ARE in the word and their known positions:
   - I is in position 4 (✓)
   - L is in the word, but **not** in positions 3 or 5 (because L got “-” in positions 3 and 5 in WILLY).  
     So L must be in position 1, 2, or 4.  
     But position 4 is already I, so L must be in position 1 or 2.

3. Word pattern so far:  
   _ _ _ I _   (with L somewhere in position 1 or 2)

4. Remaining unused common letters (excluding the eliminated set):  
   Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Z  
   Vowels: I (already placed), sometimes Y (but Y is out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
   - Ends in I _  (positions 4 and 5 must be I and something else)  
   - Contains L exactly once (since L appeared once in WILLY and was marked “-”)  
   - Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Possible patterns:  
   L _ _ I _   or   _ L _ I _

Let’s brainstorm real words that fit:
   - L _ _ I _:  
     LIMIX – not a word  
     LIVID – V is unused, D is unused → LIVID is valid  
     LIMPY – Y is out  
     LIRIC – R is out  
     LIVOR – O is out  
     LIVID seems to fit.

   - _ L _ I _:  
     FLICK – C is unused, K is unused → FLICK is valid  
     BLICK – B is unused  
     CLINK – N is out  
     PLINK – P is unused, but N is out in K  
     SLINK – S is out  
     DLICK – not a word  
     GLICK – G is unused  
     PLI… no common words.

Between LIVID and FLICK, LIVID uses I, V, I, D – but I is already in position 4.  
FLICK uses F, L, I, C, K – all letters are new or already confirmed.

FLICK introduces F, L, I, C, K.  
LIVID introduces L, I, V, I, D – but repeats I and uses V.  
FLICK seems better because it adds four new letters (F, L, C, K) while respecting all constraints.

So the next guess is FLICK.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x so far):
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, W, Y, F, C, K

Letters that ARE in the word:
- I (vowel) — somewhere, but not in positions 3 or 4 (because it got “-” in FLICK at positions 3 and 4)
- L (consonant) — somewhere, but not in positions 2, 3, or 5 (because it got “-” in positions 2, 3, and 5 so far)

So L must be in position 1 or 4.
I must be somewhere, but not in positions 3 or 4, so possible positions: 1, 2, 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains both I and L
- has L only in position 1 or 4
- has I only in positions 1, 2, or 5
- uses only letters not yet eliminated

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out):
B, D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, X, Z

Let’s list possible patterns:

1. L _ _ I _   (L in 1, I in 4) — but I cannot be in 4 (from FLICK feedback), so this is invalid.
2. L _ I _ _   (L in 1, I in 3) — but I cannot be in 3 (from FLICK), so invalid.
3. L _ _ _ I   (L in 1, I in 5) — possible. Pattern: L _ _ _ I
4. _ L _ _ I   (L in 2, I in 5) — possible. Pattern: _ L _ _ I
5. _ _ L _ I   (L in 3, I in 5) — possible. Pattern: _ _ L _ I
6. _ _ _ L I   (L in 4, I in 5) — possible. Pattern: _ _ _ L I

But L cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from earlier feedback), so:
- Pattern 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 → only valid ones are:
  - Pattern 3: L _ _ _ I
  - Pattern 5: _ _ L _ I
  - Pattern 6: _ _ _ L I

Now let’s check which of these patterns yield real words using only allowed letters.

Pattern 3: L _ _ _ I
Need three letters between L and I, none eliminated. Possible:
- LIMPY – Y out
- LIVID – V, D allowed → LIVID (but I is in 4, which is invalid)
- LIMAX – X allowed, but not a word
- LIMBO – O out
- LIGER – G, E, R – E and R out
- LIMES – S out
- LIMAN – N out
- LIMBO – O out
- LIMAX – not valid
- LIMID – not valid
- LIMUS – S out
- LIMBO – O out
- LIMAX – not valid
- LIMID – not valid
- LIMUS – S out
- LIMBO – O out
- LIMAX – not valid
- LIMID – not valid
- LIMUS – S out

Seems no common word for L _ _ _ I.

Pattern 6: _ _ _ L I
Need three letters before L, all allowed. Possible:

Seems no common word for _ _ _ L I.

Wait, let’s double-check pattern 4: _ L _ _ I
This is L in 2, I in 5. Is this allowed?
- L cannot be in 2 (from WILLY feedback), so invalid.

Pattern 2: L _ I _ _ — invalid (I in 3 from FLICK)

Pattern 1: L _ _ I _ — invalid (I in 4 from FLICK)

So the only possible positions left are:
- L in 1, I in 5 → L _ _ _ I
- L in 4, I in 5 → _ _ _ L I
- L in 4, I in 2 → _ _ L I _ — but I cannot be in 3 (from FLICK), but this is I in 2, which is allowed. Wait, FLICK had I in 3 marked “-”, so I cannot be in 3, but can be in 2 or 5.

So let’s re-examine:

Possible positions:
- L in 1: pattern L _ _ _ I
- L in 4: pattern _ _ _ L I
- L in 2: pattern _ L _ _ I (but L cannot be in 2 from WILLY feedback)
- L in 3: pattern _ _ L _ I (but L cannot be in 3 from WILLY feedback)
- L in 5: pattern _ _ _ _ L (but L cannot be in 5 from WILLY feedback)

Thus only L in 1 or 4.

For L in 1: L _ _ _ I
Need three letters between L and I, none eliminated. Possible:
- LIMPY – Y out
- LIVID – V, D allowed → LIVID (but I is in 4, which is invalid)
- LIMAX – not valid
- LIGER – G, E, R – E, R out
- LIMES – S out
- LIMAN – N out
- LIMBO – O out
- LIMUS – S out

Seems no valid word.

For L in 4: _ _ _ L I

- GADLI – not a word
- HADLI – not a word
- MADLI – not a word
- PADLI – not a word
- VADLI – not a word

Still no valid word.

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe the word has a repeated letter we haven’t considered, or a less common word.

Looking at remaining letters: B, D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, X, Z

Let’s try pattern _ _ _ L I:
- BAGLI – not a word
- DAGLI – not a word
- MAGLI – not a word
- PAGLI – not a word
- VAGLI – not a word
- GADLI – not a word
- HADLI – not a word

- LIGER – G, E, R – E, R out
- LIMES – S out
- LIMAN – N out
- LIMBO – O out
- LIMUS – S out

No valid word.

Wait, what about:
- LIVID – but I is in 4, which is invalid (from FLICK)
- LIMBO – O out
- LIMES – S out
- LIGER – E, R out
- LIMPY – Y out

No valid word.

Let’s try pattern _ L _ _ I:
- BULLI – not a word
- GULLI – not a word
- MULLI – not a word
- PULLI – not a word
- DULLI – not a word
- HULLI – not a word

- PAGLI – not a word
- VAGLI – not a word
- GADLI – not a word
- HADLI – not a word
- MADLI – not a word
- PADLI – not a word
- VADLI – not a word

No valid word.

This suggests we might have missed something. Let’s re-examine the constraints.

From FLICK:
- F(x) L(-) I(-) C(x) K(x)
This means:
- F, C, K are out.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- I is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4.

From earlier:
- L cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5 (from WILLY and FLICK)
- I cannot be in positions 3, 4 (from FLICK)

Thus possible positions:
- L: 1 or 4
- I: 1, 2, or 5

Let’s try L in 4, I in 1 or 2 or 5.

Pattern _ I _ _ L – but L cannot be in 5, so invalid.

Pattern I _ _ _ L – but L cannot be in 5, so invalid.

Pattern _ I _ L _ – but L cannot be in 4, so invalid.

Pattern _ _ I L _ – but L cannot be in 4, so invalid.

Pattern _ _ _ I L – but L cannot be in 5, so invalid.

Pattern _ L I _ _ – but I cannot be in 3, so invalid.

Pattern L _ _ _ I – but I cannot be in 4, so invalid.

Pattern _ L _ I _ – but I cannot be in 4, so invalid.

Pattern _ _ L I _ – but I cannot be in 4, so invalid.

Pattern _ _ _ L I – but L cannot be in 4, so invalid.

Wait, L must be in 1 or 4, and I must be in 1, 2, or 5.

Let’s list all valid combinations:

1. L in 1:
   - L I _ _ _ – I in 2: L I _ _ _ → need three more letters, none eliminated. Possible:
     - LIVID – but I in 2, L in 1, V, D allowed → LIVID. This is a valid word.
     - LIMID – not a word
     - LIGID – G, D allowed → LIGID (but D is allowed, G is allowed)
     - LIVOR – O out
     - LIVID seems valid.

2. L in 4:
   - _ _ _ L I – need three letters before L, none eliminated. Possible:
     - BAGLI – not a word
     - DAGLI – not a word
     - MAGLI – not a word
     - PAGLI – not a word
     - VAGLI – not a word
     - GADLI – not a word
     - HADLI – not a word
     - MADLI – not a word
     - PADLI – not a word
     - VADLI – not a word

Thus the only valid word seems to be LIVID.

Let’s verify LIVID:
- Letters: L, I, V, I, D
- L is in position 1 (allowed)
- I is in position 2 (allowed, not in 3 or 4)
- V and D are new letters, not eliminated.

This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is LIVID.
</think>

<guess>LIVID</guess>",LIVID,"Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x so far):
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, W, Y, F, C, K

Letters that ARE in the word:
- I (vowel) — somewhere, but not in positions 3 or 4 (because it got “-” in FLICK at positions 3 and 4)
- L (consonant) — somewhere, but not in positions 2, 3, or 5 (because it got “-” in positions 2, 3, and 5 so far)

So L must be in position 1 or 4.
I must be somewhere, but not in positions 3 or 4, so possible positions: 1, 2, 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains both I and L
- has L only in position 1 or 4
- has I only in positions 1, 2, or 5
- uses only letters not yet eliminated

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out):
B, D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, X, Z

Let’s list possible patterns:

1. L _ _ I _   (L in 1, I in 4) — but I cannot be in 4 (from FLICK feedback), so this is invalid.
2. L _ I _ _   (L in 1, I in 3) — but I cannot be in 3 (from FLICK), so invalid.
3. L _ _ _ I   (L in 1, I in 5) — possible. Pattern: L _ _ _ I
4. _ L _ _ I   (L in 2, I in 5) — possible. Pattern: _ L _ _ I
5. _ _ L _ I   (L in 3, I in 5) — possible. Pattern: _ _ L _ I
6. _ _ _ L I   (L in 4, I in 5) — possible. Pattern: _ _ _ L I

But L cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from earlier feedback), so:
- Pattern 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 → only valid ones are:
  - Pattern 3: L _ _ _ I
  - Pattern 5: _ _ L _ I
  - Pattern 6: _ _ _ L I

Now let’s check which of these patterns yield real words using only allowed letters.

Pattern 3: L _ _ _ I
Need three letters between L and I, none eliminated. Possible:
- LIMPY – Y out
- LIVID – V, D allowed → LIVID (but I is in 4, which is invalid)
- LIMAX – X allowed, but not a word
- LIMBO – O out
- LIGER – G, E, R – E and R out
- LIMES – S out
- LIMAN – N out
- LIMBO – O out
- LIMAX – not valid

- LIMBO – O out
- LIMAX – not valid
- LIMID – not valid
- LIMUS – S out
- LIMBO – O out
- LIMAX – not valid
- LIMID – not valid
- LIMUS – S out

Seems no common word for L _ _ _ I.

Pattern 5: _ _ L _ I
Need two letters before L, one between L and I. Possible:
- BULLI – not a word
- GULLI – not a word
- MULLI – not a word
- PULLI – not a word

Seems no common word for _ _ _ L I.

Wait, let’s double-check pattern 4: _ L _ _ I
This is L in 2, I in 5. Is this allowed?
- L cannot be in 2 (from WILLY feedback), so invalid.

Pattern 2: L _ I _ _ — invalid (I in 3 from FLICK)

Pattern 1: L _ _ I _ — invalid (I in 4 from FLICK)

So the only possible positions left are:
- L in 1, I in 5 → L _ _ _ I
- L in 4, I in 5 → _ _ _ L I
- L in 4, I in 2 → _ _ L I _ — but I cannot be in 3 (from FLICK), but this is I in 2, which is allowed. Wait, FLICK had I in 3 marked “-”, so I cannot be in 3, but can be in 2 or 5.

So let’s re-examine:

Possible positions:
- L in 1: pattern L _ _ _ I
- L in 4: pattern _ _ _ L I
- L in 2: pattern _ L _ _ I (but L cannot be in 2 from WILLY feedback)
- L in 3: pattern _ _ L _ I (but L cannot be in 3 from WILLY feedback)
- L in 5: pattern _ _ _ _ L (but L cannot be in 5 from WILLY feedback)

Thus only L in 1 or 4.

For L in 1: L _ _ _ I
Need three letters between L and I, none eliminated. Possible:

This suggests we might have missed something. Let’s re-examine the constraints.

From FLICK:
- F(x) L(-) I(-) C(x) K(x)
This means:
- F, C, K are out.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- I is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4.

From earlier:
- L cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5 (from WILLY and FLICK)
- I cannot be in positions 3, 4 (from FLICK)

Thus possible positions:
- L: 1 or 4
- I: 1, 2, or 5

Let’s try L in 4, I in 1 or 2 or 5.

Pattern _ I _ _ L – but L cannot be in 5, so invalid.

Pattern I _ _ _ L – but L cannot be in 5, so invalid.

Pattern _ I _ L _ – but L cannot be in 4, so invalid.

Pattern _ _ _ L I – but L cannot be in 4, so invalid.

Wait, L must be in 1 or 4, and I must be in 1, 2, or 5.

Let’s list all valid combinations:

1. L in 1:
   - L I _ _ _ – I in 2: L I _ _ _ → need three more letters, none eliminated. Possible:
     - LIVID – but I in 2, L in 1, V, D allowed → LIVID. This is a valid word.

Thus the only valid word seems to be LIVID.

Let’s verify LIVID:
- Letters: L, I, V, I, D
- L is in position 1 (allowed)
- I is in position 2 (allowed, not in 3 or 4)
- V and D are new letters, not eliminated.

This fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word.

Some popular first guesses are words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AUDIO"". These words contain multiple vowels and common consonants. I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it has three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should provide good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every word that contains any of those five letters.  
To maximize information in the next guess, I’ll pick a word that uses entirely different letters, ideally covering other high-frequency consonants and vowels.  
A good candidate is “UNTIL”: it contains U, N, T, I, L — none of which were in AROSE, and it hits several common letters that might appear in the secret word.  
Another strong choice would be “CHIMP” or “BLIMP,” but “UNTIL” feels slightly more balanced for first-time feedback.  
I’ll go with “UNTIL.”

<|im_end|>

We now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T  
- Letters IN the word and in the correct positions: I (4th) and L (5th)  
- So the secret word ends in “IL” and has three other letters that must come from the remaining alphabet (excluding the eliminated set).

Common remaining consonants include D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Vowels left: I, Y (Y sometimes acts as a vowel).  
We need three new letters that haven’t been tried yet.

A good next guess should introduce several fresh, high-frequency letters while respecting the fixed ending “IL”.  
Candidate words:
- “WHILM” – but W and H are okay, M is okay, but it’s less common.  
- “CHIMP” – C, H, M, P are all unused.  
- “BLIMP” – B, L, M, P; L is already confirmed, so this is valid.  
- “GIMPY” – G, M, P, Y; ends in PY, which conflicts with known IL.  
- “DILLY” – D, L, L, Y; ends in LY, again conflicting.  
- “FILMY” – F, L, M, Y; ends in MY, conflicting.  
- “WIMPY” – same issue with ending.  

Best fit: “CHIMP” – letters C, H, M, P are all new and high-frequency, and the ending “MP” is compatible with the known “IL” (though it doesn’t test the ending directly; we’ll get more info from the feedback).

Wait – the known ending is “IL”, so any guess must end in “IL”.  
So the structure is _ _ _ I L.  
That changes things: the first three letters must be from the remaining alphabet, and the last two are locked.  
So we need three new letters for positions 1-3, none of which can be A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T.  

Remaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: I (already used), Y (sometimes vowel).  

We need three distinct letters from the remaining set.  
Possible combinations:  
- B, C, D → “BCDIL” – not a word.  
- C, H, M → “CHMIL” – not a word.  
- D, I, L – but I and L are fixed.  
- F, I, L – same.  
- G, I, L – same.  
- H, I, L – same.  
- K, I, L – same.  
- M, I, L – same.  
- P, I, L – same.  
- V, I, L – same.  
- W, I, L – same.  

We need real 5-letter words ending in “IL”.  
Real words ending in “IL”:  
- “WILL” – only 4 letters.  
- “FILMY” – ends in “MY”.  
- “HILAR” – ends in “AR”.  
- “TILDA” – ends in “DA”.  
- “GILTS” – ends in “TS”.  
- “DILTS” – ends in “TS”.  
- “CILIA” – ends in “IA”.  
- “MILCH” – ends in “CH”.  
- “PILCH” – ends in “CH”.  
- “WILDS” – ends in “DS”.  
- “DILLY” – ends in “LY”.  
- “FILLY” – ends in “LY”.  
- “GILLY” – ends in “LY”.  
- “HILLY” – ends in “LY”.  
- “MILLY” – ends in “LY”.  
- “PILLY” – ends in “LY”.  
- “SILLY” – ends in “LY” (but S is eliminated).  
- “TILLY” – ends in “LY” (T is eliminated).  
- “WILLY” – ends in “LY” (W is okay, but T is eliminated, so W is allowed).  

Looking through these, the only remaining common words ending in “IL” that use new letters are:  
- “WILLY” – W, I, L, L, Y.  
- “MILLY” – M, I, L, L, Y.  
- “PILLY” – P, I, L, L, Y.  
- “FILLY” – F, I, L, L, Y.  
- “DILLY” – D, I, L, L, Y.  
- “GILLY” – G, I, L, L, Y.  
- “HILLY” – H, I, L, L, Y.  

Among these, “WILLY” uses W, L, Y – but L is already confirmed in position 5.  
Similarly, “MILLY” uses M, L, Y – but L is already in position 5.  
The first three letters must be new.  

Looking for words with distinct first three letters ending in “IL”:  
- “WIMIL” – not a word.  
- “CHIMB” – not ending in “IL”.  
- “BILLY” – B, I, L, L, Y – B is new, but I and L are fixed.  
- “DILLY” – D is new.  
- “FILLY” – F is new.  
- “GILLY” – G is new.  
- “HILLY” – H is new.  
- “PILLY” – P is new.  
- “WILLY” – W is new.  

The most common among these is “WILLY” (though it repeats L twice).  
Another is “BILLY”.  
A less common but valid word is “WIMIL” – but it’s not standard.  
Another possibility is “CHIMB” – but it doesn’t end in “IL”.  

Upon reflection, the simplest valid 5-letter word ending in “IL” with new letters is “WILLY” (W, I, L, L, Y).  
But since L is already fixed in position 5, the word must be _ _ _ I L.  
So the first three letters must be new.  
Real words ending in “IL” with distinct first three letters:  
- “WIMIL” – not valid.  
- “CHIMB” – not ending in “IL”.  
- “BILLY” – B, I, L, L, Y – B is new, but L repeats.  
- “DILLY” – D, I, L, L, Y – D is new.  
- “FILLY” – F, I, L, L, Y – F is new.  
- “GILLY” – G, I, L, L, Y – G is new.  
- “HILLY” – H, I, L, L, Y – H is new.  
- “PILLY” – P, I, L, L, Y – P is new.  
- “WILLY” – W, I, L, L, Y – W is new.  

The most straightforward choice is “WILLY” (W, I, L, L, Y).  
It introduces W and Y as new letters, and we already know I and L are in their correct positions.  

Therefore, the next guess should be “WILLY”.

Let’s update what we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word:  
   A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, W, Y

2. Letters that ARE in the word and their known positions:
   - I is in position 4 (✓)
   - L is in the word, but **not** in positions 3 or 5 (because L got “-” in positions 3 and 5 in WILLY).  
     So L must be in position 1, 2, or 4.  
     But position 4 is already I, so L must be in position 1 or 2.

3. Word pattern so far:  
   _ _ _ I _   (with L somewhere in position 1 or 2)

4. Remaining unused common letters (excluding the eliminated set):  
   Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Z  
   Vowels: I (already placed), sometimes Y (but Y is out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
   - Ends in I _  (positions 4 and 5 must be I and something else)  
   - Contains L exactly once (since L appeared once in WILLY and was marked “-”)  
   - Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Possible patterns:  
   L _ _ I _   or   _ L _ I _

Let’s brainstorm real words that fit:
   - L _ _ I _:  
     LIMIX – not a word  
     LIVID – V is unused, D is unused → LIVID is valid  
     LIMPY – Y is out  
     LIRIC – R is out  
     LIVOR – O is out  
     LIVID seems to fit.

   - _ L _ I _:  
     FLICK – C is unused, K is unused → FLICK is valid  
     BLICK – B is unused  
     CLINK – N is out  
     PLINK – P is unused, but N is out in K  
     SLINK – S is out  
     DLICK – not a word  
     GLICK – G is unused  
     PLI… no common words.

Between LIVID and FLICK, LIVID uses I, V, I, D – but I is already in position 4.  
FLICK uses F, L, I, C, K – all letters are new or already confirmed.

FLICK introduces F, L, I, C, K.  
LIVID introduces L, I, V, I, D – but repeats I and uses V.  
FLICK seems better because it adds four new letters (F, L, C, K) while respecting all constraints.

So the next guess is FLICK.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x so far):
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, W, Y, F, C, K

Letters that ARE in the word:
- I (vowel) — somewhere, but not in positions 3 or 4 (because it got “-” in FLICK at positions 3 and 4)
- L (consonant) — somewhere, but not in positions 2, 3, or 5 (because it got “-” in positions 2, 3, and 5 so far)

So L must be in position 1 or 4.
I must be somewhere, but not in positions 3 or 4, so possible positions: 1, 2, 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains both I and L
- has L only in position 1 or 4
- has I only in positions 1, 2, or 5
- uses only letters not yet eliminated

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out):
B, D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, X, Z

Let’s list possible patterns:

1. L _ _ I _   (L in 1, I in 4) — but I cannot be in 4 (from FLICK feedback), so this is invalid.
2. L _ I _ _   (L in 1, I in 3) — but I cannot be in 3 (from FLICK), so invalid.
3. L _ _ _ I   (L in 1, I in 5) — possible. Pattern: L _ _ _ I
4. _ L _ _ I   (L in 2, I in 5) — possible. Pattern: _ L _ _ I
5. _ _ L _ I   (L in 3, I in 5) — possible. Pattern: _ _ L _ I
6. _ _ _ L I   (L in 4, I in 5) — possible. Pattern: _ _ _ L I

But L cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from earlier feedback), so:
- Pattern 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 → only valid ones are:
  - Pattern 3: L _ _ _ I
  - Pattern 5: _ _ L _ I
  - Pattern 6: _ _ _ L I

Now let’s check which of these patterns yield real words using only allowed letters.

Pattern 3: L _ _ _ I
Need three letters between L and I, none eliminated. Possible:
- LIMPY – Y out
- LIVID – V, D allowed → LIVID (but I is in 4, which is invalid)
- LIMAX – X allowed, but not a word
- LIMBO – O out
- LIGER – G, E, R – E and R out
- LIMES – S out
- LIMAN – N out
- LIMBO – O out
- LIMAX – not valid
- LIMID – not valid
- LIMUS – S out
- LIMBO – O out
- LIMAX – not valid
- LIMID – not valid
- LIMUS – S out
- LIMBO – O out
- LIMAX – not valid
- LIMID – not valid
- LIMUS – S out

Seems no common word for L _ _ _ I.

Pattern 5: _ _ L _ I
Need two letters before L, one between L and I. Possible:
- BULLI – not a word
- GULLI – not a word
- MULLI – not a word
- PULLI – not a word
- DULLI – not a word
- HULLI – not a word
- VULLI – not a word
- GULCH – ends with CH, not I
- GULFS – S out
- GULPS – S out
- GULLE – not a word
- GULIO – O out
- GULCH – not ending in I
- GULFS – S out
- GULPS – S out
- GULLE – not a word
- GULIO – O out
- GULCH – not ending in I
- GULFS – S out
- GULPS – S out

Not finding common words here.

Pattern 6: _ _ _ L I
Need three letters before L, all allowed. Possible:
- BAGLI – not a word
- DAGLI – not a word
- MAGLI – not a word
- PAGLI – not a word
- VAGLI – not a word
- GADLI – not a word
- HADLI – not a word
- MADLI – not a word
- PADLI – not a word
- VADLI – not a word
- BAGLI – not a word
- DAGLI – not a word
- MAGLI – not a word
- PAGLI – not a word
- VAGLI – not a word
- GADLI – not a word
- HADLI – not a word
- MADLI – not a word
- PADLI – not a word
- VADLI – not a word

Seems no common word for _ _ _ L I.

Wait, let’s double-check pattern 4: _ L _ _ I
This is L in 2, I in 5. Is this allowed?
- L cannot be in 2 (from WILLY feedback), so invalid.

Pattern 2: L _ I _ _ — invalid (I in 3 from FLICK)

Pattern 1: L _ _ I _ — invalid (I in 4 from FLICK)

So the only possible positions left are:
- L in 1, I in 5 → L _ _ _ I
- L in 4, I in 5 → _ _ _ L I
- L in 4, I in 2 → _ _ L I _ — but I cannot be in 3 (from FLICK), but this is I in 2, which is allowed. Wait, FLICK had I in 3 marked “-”, so I cannot be in 3, but can be in 2 or 5.

So let’s re-examine:

Possible positions:
- L in 1: pattern L _ _ _ I
- L in 4: pattern _ _ _ L I
- L in 2: pattern _ L _ _ I (but L cannot be in 2 from WILLY feedback)
- L in 3: pattern _ _ L _ I (but L cannot be in 3 from WILLY feedback)
- L in 5: pattern _ _ _ _ L (but L cannot be in 5 from WILLY feedback)

Thus only L in 1 or 4.

For L in 1: L _ _ _ I
Need three letters between L and I, none eliminated. Possible:
- LIMPY – Y out
- LIVID – V, D allowed → LIVID (but I is in 4, which is invalid)
- LIMAX – not valid
- LIGER – G, E, R – E, R out
- LIMES – S out
- LIMAN – N out
- LIMBO – O out
- LIMUS – S out

Seems no valid word.

For L in 4: _ _ _ L I
Need three letters before L, none eliminated. Possible:
- BAGLI – not a word
- DAGLI – not a word
- MAGLI – not a word
- PAGLI – not a word
- VAGLI – not a word
- GADLI – not a word
- HADLI – not a word
- MADLI – not a word
- PADLI – not a word
- VADLI – not a word

Still no valid word.

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe the word has a repeated letter we haven’t considered, or a less common word.

Looking at remaining letters: B, D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, X, Z

Let’s try pattern _ _ _ L I:
- BAGLI – not a word
- DAGLI – not a word
- MAGLI – not a word
- PAGLI – not a word
- VAGLI – not a word
- GADLI – not a word
- HADLI – not a word
- MADLI – not a word
- PADLI – not a word
- VADLI – not a word

No valid word.

Pattern L _ _ _ I:
- LIMPY – Y out
- LIVID – V, D allowed → LIVID (but I in 4 invalid)
- LIGER – G, E, R – E, R out
- LIMES – S out
- LIMAN – N out
- LIMBO – O out
- LIMUS – S out

No valid word.

Wait, what about:
- LIVID – but I is in 4, which is invalid (from FLICK)
- LIMBO – O out
- LIMES – S out
- LIGER – E, R out
- LIMPY – Y out

No valid word.

Let’s try pattern _ L _ _ I:
- BULLI – not a word
- GULLI – not a word
- MULLI – not a word
- PULLI – not a word
- DULLI – not a word
- HULLI – not a word
- VULLI – not a word

No valid word.

Pattern _ _ L _ I:
- BULGI – not a word
- DULGI – not a word
- GULGI – not a word
- HULGI – not a word
- MULGI – not a word
- PULGI – not a word
- VULGI – not a word

No valid word.

Pattern _ _ _ L I:
- BAGLI – not a word
- DAGLI – not a word
- MAGLI – not a word
- PAGLI – not a word
- VAGLI – not a word
- GADLI – not a word
- HADLI – not a word
- MADLI – not a word
- PADLI – not a word
- VADLI – not a word

No valid word.

This suggests we might have missed something. Let’s re-examine the constraints.

From FLICK:
- F(x) L(-) I(-) C(x) K(x)
This means:
- F, C, K are out.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.
- I is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4.

From earlier:
- L cannot be in positions 2, 3, 5 (from WILLY and FLICK)
- I cannot be in positions 3, 4 (from FLICK)

Thus possible positions:
- L: 1 or 4
- I: 1, 2, or 5

Let’s try L in 4, I in 1 or 2 or 5.

Pattern _ I _ _ L – but L cannot be in 5, so invalid.

Pattern I _ _ _ L – but L cannot be in 5, so invalid.

Pattern _ I _ L _ – but L cannot be in 4, so invalid.

Pattern _ _ I L _ – but L cannot be in 4, so invalid.

Pattern _ _ _ I L – but L cannot be in 5, so invalid.

Pattern _ L I _ _ – but I cannot be in 3, so invalid.

Pattern L _ _ _ I – but I cannot be in 4, so invalid.

Pattern _ L _ I _ – but I cannot be in 4, so invalid.

Pattern _ _ L I _ – but I cannot be in 4, so invalid.

Pattern _ _ _ L I – but L cannot be in 4, so invalid.

Wait, L must be in 1 or 4, and I must be in 1, 2, or 5.

Let’s list all valid combinations:

1. L in 1:
   - L I _ _ _ – I in 2: L I _ _ _ → need three more letters, none eliminated. Possible:
     - LIVID – but I in 2, L in 1, V, D allowed → LIVID. This is a valid word.
     - LIMID – not a word
     - LIGID – G, D allowed → LIGID (but D is allowed, G is allowed)
     - LIVOR – O out
     - LIVID seems valid.

2. L in 4:
   - _ _ _ L I – need three letters before L, none eliminated. Possible:
     - BAGLI – not a word
     - DAGLI – not a word
     - MAGLI – not a word
     - PAGLI – not a word
     - VAGLI – not a word
     - GADLI – not a word
     - HADLI – not a word
     - MADLI – not a word
     - PADLI – not a word
     - VADLI – not a word

Thus the only valid word seems to be LIVID.

Let’s verify LIVID:
- Letters: L, I, V, I, D
- L is in position 1 (allowed)
- I is in position 2 (allowed, not in 3 or 4)
- V and D are new letters, not eliminated.

This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is LIVID.

Let’s re-examine all constraints after the fifth guess.

Known letters that are NOT in the word (x so far):
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, W, Y, F, C, K, D

Known letters that ARE in the word:
- I (✓) – must appear at least twice, and we now see it appears in positions 2 and 4.
- L (✓) – must appear at least once, but we’ve never seen it in the correct position yet.

From the feedback on LIVID:
- L in position 1 → (-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- I in position 2 → (✓) → I is in position 2.
- V in position 3 → (-) → V is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- I in position 4 → (✓) → I is in position 4.
- D in position 5 → (x) → D is NOT in the word.

So the word must:
- Have I in positions 2 and 4 (fixed).
- Have L somewhere, but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (from earlier feedback).  
  The only remaining spot for L is position 3.
- Have V somewhere, but NOT in position 3 (from LIVID feedback).  
  V must be in position 1 or 5.
- Cannot contain any of the eliminated letters.

Current pattern:
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Letters:   _ I _ I _

We know:
- Position 3 must be L (only remaining spot for L).
- Positions 1 and 5 must be filled with letters not yet eliminated and not already used (I, L, V are already placed).

Letters still allowed (excluding all eliminated so far):
B, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, X, Z

But V cannot be in position 3 (already satisfied) and we haven’t ruled out V from positions 1 or 5.  
However, we know V is in the word (from LIVID feedback), so V must be in position 1 or 5.

Let’s list the two possibilities:

Case 1: V in position 1
Word pattern: V I L I _

We need a letter for position 5 that:
- Has not been eliminated (not A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, W, Y, F, C, K, D)
- Is not already used (I, L, V are already used)
- Is among the remaining letters: B, G, H, J, M, P, Q, X, Z

Real words ending in these letters:
- VILIN – not a word
- VILIP – not a word
- VILIG – not a word
- VILIG – not a word
- VILIP – not a word
- VILIX – not a word
- VILIZ – not a word

None of these are valid.

Case 2: V in position 5
Word pattern: _ I L I V

We need a letter for position 1 from remaining allowed letters: B, G, H, J, M, P, Q, X, Z

Real words:
- BILIV – not a word
- GILIV – not a word
- HILIV – not a word
- JILIV – not a word
- MILIV – not a word
- PILIV – not a word
- QILIV – not a word
- XILIV – not a word
- ZILIV – not a word

None of these are valid.

Wait, let’s double-check the constraints.  
From LIVID, we know:
- V is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
  So V must be in position 1 or 5.

From the pattern _ I _ I _, and knowing L must be in position 3 (only spot left), we have:
- _ I L I _

So the word must be _ I L I V or V I L I _.

But neither V I L I _ nor _ I L I V yields a valid English word.

This suggests we may have made an error.  
Let’s re-examine the feedback:

From LIVID:
- L(-) – L is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- I(✓) – I is in position 2.
- V(-) – V is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- I(✓) – I is in position 4.
- D(x) – D is NOT in the word.

So the word has:
- I in positions 2 and 4.
- L must be in the word, but positions 1, 2, 3, 5 are ruled out for L.  
  This is impossible – L cannot be placed anywhere.

This contradiction implies our earlier assumption that I appears twice is incorrect.  
Let’s re-read the feedback carefully.

From Guess 2 (UNTIL):
- I(✓) – I is in position 4.

From Guess 3 (WILLY):
- I(✓) – I is in position 2.

From Guess 4 (FLICK):
- I(-) – I is in the word but NOT in position 3.

From Guess 5 (LIVID):
- I(✓) – I is in position 2.
- I(✓) – I is in position 4.

This shows I is confirmed in positions 2 and 4.

From Guess 5, L is in the word but NOT in position 1.

From Guess 3, L is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.

From Guess 4, L is in the word but NOT in position 2.

So L must be in position 5.

From Guess 5, V is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Thus the word must be:
_ I _ I L

With:
- L in position 5.
- I in positions 2 and 4.
- V must be in position 1 or 3 (but NOT 3, from LIVID feedback), so V in position 1.

So the word is V I _ I L.

We need a letter for position 3 from remaining allowed letters: B, G, H, J, M, P, Q, X, Z.

Real words:
- VIGIL – G is allowed, but G hasn’t been eliminated.
- VIGIL – V I G I L

Check constraints:
- V in position 1 – allowed (not eliminated, and V is confirmed in word).
- I in positions 2 and 4 – confirmed.
- G in position 3 – not eliminated.
- L in position 5 – allowed (not eliminated, and L is confirmed).

All letters are from the allowed set.

Therefore, the word must be VIGIL.
</think>

The only valid word that fits all constraints is VIGIL.

<guess>VIGIL</guess>",VIGIL,"Let’s re-examine all constraints after the fifth guess.

Known letters that are NOT in the word (x so far):
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, W, Y, F, C, K, D

Known letters that ARE in the word:
- I (✓) – must appear at least twice, and we now see it appears in positions 2 and 4.
- L (✓) – must appear at least once, but we’ve never seen it in the correct position yet.

From the feedback on LIVID:
- L in position 1 → (-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- I in position 2 → (✓) → I is in position 2.
- V in position 3 → (-) → V is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- I in position 4 → (✓) → I is in position 4.
- D in position 5 → (x) → D is NOT in the word.

So the word must:
- Have I in positions 2 and 4 (fixed).
- Have L somewhere, but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (from earlier feedback).  
  The only remaining spot for L is position 3.
- Have V somewhere, but NOT in position 3 (from LIVID feedback).  
  V must be in position 1 or 5.
- Cannot contain any of the eliminated letters.

Current pattern:
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Letters:   _ I _ I _

We know:
- Position 3 must be L (only remaining spot for L).
- Positions 1 and 5 must be filled with letters not yet eliminated and not already used (I, L, V are already placed).

Letters still allowed (excluding all eliminated so far):
B, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, X, Z

But V cannot be in position 3 (already satisfied) and we haven’t ruled out V from positions 1 or 5.  
However, we know V is in the word (from LIVID feedback), so V must be in position 1 or 5.

Let’s list the two possibilities:

Case 1: V in position 1
Word pattern: V I L I _

We need a letter for position 5 that:
- Has not been eliminated (not A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, W, Y, F, C, K, D)
- Is not already used (I, L, V are already used)
- Is among the remaining letters: B, G, H, J, M, P, Q, X, Z

Real words ending in these letters:
- VILIN – not a word
- VILIP – not a word
- VILIG – not a word
- VILIG – not a word
- VILIP – not a word
- VILIX – not a word
- VILIZ – not a word

None of these are valid.

Case 2: V in position 5
Word pattern: _ I L I V

We need a letter for position 1 from remaining allowed letters: B, G, H, J, M, P, Q, X, Z

Real words:
- BILIV – not a word
- GILIV – not a word
- HILIV – not a word
- JILIV – not a word
- MILIV – not a word
- PILIV – not a word
- QILIV – not a word
- XILIV – not a word
- ZILIV – not a word

None of these are valid.

Wait, let’s double-check the constraints.  
From LIVID, we know:
- V is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
  So V must be in position 1 or 5.

From the pattern _ I _ I _, and knowing L must be in position 3 (only spot left), we have:
- _ I L I _

So the word must be _ I L I V or V I L I _.

But neither V I L I _ nor _ I L I V yields a valid English word.

This suggests we may have made an error.  
Let’s re-examine the feedback:

From LIVID:
- L(-) – L is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- I(✓) – I is in position 2.
- V(-) – V is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- I(✓) – I is in position 4.
- D(x) – D is NOT in the word.

So the word has:
- I in positions 2 and 4.
- L must be in the word, but positions 1, 2, 3, 5 are ruled out for L.  
  This is impossible – L cannot be placed anywhere.

This contradiction implies our earlier assumption that I appears twice is incorrect.  
Let’s re-read the feedback carefully.

From Guess 2 (UNTIL):
- I(✓) – I is in position 4.

From Guess 3 (WILLY):
- I(✓) – I is in position 2.

From Guess 4 (FLICK):
- I(-) – I is in the word but NOT in position 3.

From Guess 5 (LIVID):
- I(✓) – I is in position 2.
- I(✓) – I is in position 4.

This shows I is confirmed in positions 2 and 4.

From Guess 5, L is in the word but NOT in position 1.

From Guess 3, L is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.

From Guess 4, L is in the word but NOT in position 2.

So L must be in position 5.

From Guess 5, V is in the word but NOT in position 3.

Thus the word must be:
_ I _ I L

With:
- L in position 5.
- I in positions 2 and 4.
- V must be in position 1 or 3 (but NOT 3, from LIVID feedback), so V in position 1.

So the word is V I _ I L.

We need a letter for position 3 from remaining allowed letters: B, G, H, J, M, P, Q, X, Z.

Real words:
- VIGIL – G is allowed, but G hasn’t been eliminated.
- VIGIL – V I G I L

Check constraints:
- V in position 1 – allowed (not eliminated, and V is confirmed in word).
- I in positions 2 and 4 – confirmed.
- G in position 3 – not eliminated.
- L in position 5 – allowed (not eliminated, and L is confirmed).

All letters are from the allowed set.

Therefore, the word must be VIGIL.The only valid word that fits all constraints is VIGIL.",Guess 6: VIGIL -> FEEDBACK: V(✓) I(✓) G(✓) I(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
