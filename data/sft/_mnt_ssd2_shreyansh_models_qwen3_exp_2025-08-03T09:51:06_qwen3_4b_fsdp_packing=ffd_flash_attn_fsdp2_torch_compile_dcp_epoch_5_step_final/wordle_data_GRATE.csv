### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these common letters in different positions. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and they are all in different positions, which should give me good information about which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)  
- R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter)  
- O is NOT in the word (x)  
- S is NOT in the word (x)  
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter)  

So we now know:
1. The word is _ R _ _ E
2. It contains A somewhere (but not 1st position)
3. It does NOT contain O or S

Next guess should:
- Keep R in 2nd and E in 5th
- Try to place A in a new spot
- Avoid O and S entirely
- Introduce new common letters to test

A good candidate is ""CRANE"":
- C: new letter
- R: confirmed in 2nd
- A: test in 3rd (since 1st is ruled out)
- N: new letter
- E: confirmed in 5th

This tests C, N, and keeps R/E while moving A to a new position.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these common letters in different positions. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and they are all in different positions, which should give me good information about which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)  
- R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter)  
- O is NOT in the word (x)  
- S is NOT in the word (x)  
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter)  

So we now know:
1. The word is _ R _ _ E
2. It contains A somewhere (but not 1st position)
3. It does NOT contain O or S

Next guess should:
- Keep R in 2nd and E in 5th
- Try to place A in a new spot
- Avoid O and S entirely
- Introduce new common letters to test

A good candidate is ""CRANE"":
- C: new letter
- R: confirmed in 2nd
- A: test in 3rd (since 1st is ruled out)
- N: new letter
- E: confirmed in 5th

This tests C, N, and keeps R/E while moving A to a new position.

- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, C, N  
- Letters confirmed in the word: R (2nd), A (3rd), E (5th)  
- We still need to determine the 1st and 4th letters.

Good remaining common letters to test: T, L, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, Y, etc.
