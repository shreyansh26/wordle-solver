### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

  Therefore O cannot be in positions 2 or 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R and O exactly once each.
- R is in position 3, 4, or 5.
- O is in position 1, 4, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated: no A, S, E, U, N, D.

Good remaining consonants: T, L, C, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I (since A, E, O are considered; U is out).

Let’s try to place O and R together in positions 4 and 5:
- O in position 4, R in position 5 → word ends in OR.
- Need 3 more letters from allowed set: T, L, C, M, P, H, I, etc.

A candidate: CROFT
- C, F, T are new letters.
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- O is in position 2 (but we just saw O cannot be in position 2). So CROFT is invalid.

Next candidate: PROXY
- P, X, Y are new (but X/Y may be too obscure).
- R in position 2 (invalid, already ruled out).

Next candidate: GROIN
- G, I, N, but N is eliminated.

Next candidate: CROOK

Let’s try O in position 1 and R in position 3, 4, or 5:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains R and O, but R is not in position 2 and O is not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain A, S, or E.

Next guess should:
- Keep R and O but move them away from positions 2 and 3.
- Introduce new common consonants to test (T, L, N, etc.).
- Avoid A, S, E.

A good candidate is ""FRONT"":
- F: new consonant
- R: must stay, but now in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2, so this is risky)
Wait, feedback said R is in the word but not in position 2. So R must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5 in the secret word.

Let's try ""ROUND"":
- R in position 1 (could be correct)
- O in position 2 (could be correct)
- U, N, D are new letters

But O was in position 3 in AROSE and feedback said O is in the word but not in position 3, so position 2 is possible for O.

""ROUND"" seems better:
- R in position 1
- O in position 2
- U, N, D are new letters

  Therefore R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.

From all feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – R is in word, not in position 2.  
   – O is in word, not in position 3.

2. ROUND → R(-) O(-) U(x) N(x) D(x)  
   – R not in position 1, O not in position 2.

3. ORBIT → O(-) R(-) B(x) I(-) T(x)  
   – O not in position 1, R not in position 3, I not in position 4.

4. CHIRO → C(x) H(x) I(-) R(-) O(-)  
   – I not in position 3, R not in position 4, O not in position 5.

Current constraints:

- R must be in position 5 (only remaining spot after ruling out 1-4).  
- O must be in position 4 (only remaining spot after ruling out 1-3).  
- I must be in position 2 (only remaining spot after ruling out 1,4).  

Thus the word must be: _ I O R 5

We need the first letter to be any allowed letter not yet used (allowed letters so far: C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z minus C, H already ruled out).  
Valid choices: F, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Candidate: F I O R 5 → FIORK? Not a valid word.  
K I O R 5 → KIOR? Too short.

Z I O R 5 → ZIOR? Not valid.

Wait, we need a valid 5-letter word. Let’s think differently: the pattern is _ I O R _ but we already fixed O in 4 and R in 5. So the pattern is: _ I O R ?  
But we have O in 4 and R in 5, so the word must be _ I O R 5, but we have 5 letters, so positions 1-5: 1 2 3 4 5.

We have:
- Position 2: I (from I not in 1,4,5 and must be in 2)
- Position 4: O (from O not in 1,2,3,5 and must be in 4)
- Position 5: R (from R not in 1-4 and must be in 5)

Thus the word must be: _ I _ O R

Now we need to fill position 1 and 3 with allowed letters (not yet eliminated). Allowed letters: C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z minus C, H already ruled out in CHIRO.  
So position 1 and 3 can be F, G, K, L, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.
