For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters while avoiding repeats. 

Some good first guesses include:
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So the secret word contains A, R, O, but not S or E.  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, E  
Letters we know ARE in the word (but positions unknown): A, R, O  

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, R, O plus two other letters (not S or E).  
Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are already confirmed, E is ruled out).

Let’s try a word that places A, R, O in new positions and introduces two new consonants.  
A common pattern is to use A, R, O plus T and N.  
A word that fits: “RATIO” – but it has I and T, and we already know O is in the word. However, “RATIO” has A in position 2, R in position 1, T in position 3, I in position 4, O in position 5. This tests new positions for A, R, O and introduces T and I.  
Another option is “TAROC” – but C is less common.  
A better balanced choice is “RATIO”.

But let’s verify:  
- Must contain A, R, O.  
- Must not contain S or E.  
- Must be a valid 5-letter word.  
“RATIO” is valid and meets all criteria.  
However, let’s pick a word that spreads the known letters more evenly.  
Another candidate: “TROAK” – but K is uncommon.  
“ROAST” – but S is ruled out.  
“TORAH” – H is uncommon.  
“TAROK” – K is uncommon.  
“TORAI” – I is a vowel we haven’t tested yet, but “TORAI” is valid.  

But to maximize new letter coverage, let’s use two new consonants.  
A good choice: “TARON” – but N is common.  
“TARON” is valid.  

However, “TARON” is a valid word meaning a unit of measurement, but let’s pick something more common.  
“TAROC” is a variant spelling of tarot cards, but C is less common.  
“TROAK” is obscure.  
“TORAI” is obscure.  
“TARON” is acceptable but not super common.  

A better common word: “RATIO” – valid, common, tests new positions for A, R, O, and introduces I and T.  

But let’s double-check:  
- A is in word, not position 1.  
- R is in word, not position 2.  
- O is in word, not position 3.  

In “RATIO”:  
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since original A was position 1).  
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since original R was position 2).  
- O is in position 5 (allowed, since original O was position 3).  

This fits all constraints.  
Another candidate: “TORAH” – but H is uncommon.  
“TORAI” – I is new, but “TORAI” is obscure.  
“RATIO” seems the best balance.  

But let’s try “RATIO”.

Based on the feedback that A, R, and O are in the word but not in their original positions, and S and E are not in the word, I will test new positions for A, R, O and introduce two new letters (T and I) to maximize information gain.

- B, R, A, V, O
- A is in position 2 (correct)
- R is in position 2? No, position 2 is A. So R must be in 3,4, or 5. In BRAVO, R is in position 2 - that's wrong.
  
Next candidate: ""DRAVO"" - invalid. ""FRAVO"" - invalid. ""GRAFO"" - invalid. ""LARDO"" - valid:
- L, A, R, D, O
- A in position 2 (correct)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- O in position 5 - but O cannot be in position 5 (from RATIO feedback: O was in position 5 and marked (-), so O is in word but not in position 5). So LARDO is invalid.

Next: ""CARRO"" - invalid. ""MORAL"" - but A is in position 2, so ""MORAL"" has A in position 4 - wrong. ""ORAL"" is 4 letters.

Next: ""FARON"" - invalid. ""GAROL"" - invalid. ""HARPO"" - invalid. ""JARDO"" - invalid. ""KARDO"" - invalid. ""LARDO"" already checked. ""MARCO"" - valid:
- M, A, R, C, O
- A in position 2 (correct)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- O in position 5 - but O cannot be in position 5 (from RATIO feedback), so MARCO is invalid.

Next: ""PAPAR"" - invalid. ""MORAY"" - invalid. ""VAPOR"" - valid:
- V, A, P, O, R
- A in position 2 (correct)
- O in position 4 (allowed)
- R in position 5 (allowed)
- Letters used: V, P - both allowed
- No S, E, T, I
This seems valid.

Let's verify:
- Position 1: V (unknown)
- Position 2: A (matches ✓)
- Position 3: P (unknown)
- Position 4: O (must be in word, position 4 is allowed)
- Position 5: R (must be in word, position 5 is allowed)
This fits all constraints.

Based on the feedback:
- A is fixed in position 2.
- R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.
- O is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5.
- Letters S, E, T, I are eliminated.

A valid word that fits these constraints is VAPOR, where:
- A is in position 2 (correct).
- R is in position 5 (allowed).
- O is in position 4 (allowed).
- V and P are new letters not yet tested.

- I(x): I is not in the word.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
Letters in the word: A (fixed at position 2), R, O
Letters NOT in the word: S, E, T, I
Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Positions we know:
- Position 2 = A
- R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2 (from AROSE and RATIO feedback)

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters while avoiding repeats. 

Some good first guesses include:
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So the secret word contains A, R, O, but not S or E.  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, E  
Letters we know ARE in the word (but positions unknown): A, R, O  

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, R, O plus two other letters (not S or E).  
Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are already confirmed, E is ruled out).

Let’s try a word that places A, R, O in new positions and introduces two new consonants.  
A common pattern is to use A, R, O plus T and N.  
A word that fits: “RATIO” – but it has I and T, and we already know O is in the word. However, “RATIO” has A in position 2, R in position 1, T in position 3, I in position 4, O in position 5. This tests new positions for A, R, O and introduces T and I.  
Another option is “TAROC” – but C is less common.  
A better balanced choice is “RATIO”.

But let’s verify:  
- Must contain A, R, O.  
- Must not contain S or E.  
- Must be a valid 5-letter word.  
“RATIO” is valid and meets all criteria.  
However, let’s pick a word that spreads the known letters more evenly.  
Another candidate: “TROAK” – but K is uncommon.  
“ROAST” – but S is ruled out.  
“TORAH” – H is uncommon.  
“TAROK” – K is uncommon.  
“TORAI” – I is a vowel we haven’t tested yet, but “TORAI” is valid.  

But to maximize new letter coverage, let’s use two new consonants.  
A good choice: “TARON” – but N is common.  
“TARON” is valid.  

However, “TARON” is a valid word meaning a unit of measurement, but let’s pick something more common.  
“TAROC” is a variant spelling of tarot cards, but C is less common.  
“TROAK” is obscure.  
“TORAI” is obscure.  
“TARON” is acceptable but not super common.  

A better common word: “RATIO” – valid, common, tests new positions for A, R, O, and introduces I and T.  

But let’s double-check:  
- A is in word, not position 1.  
- R is in word, not position 2.  
- O is in word, not position 3.  

In “RATIO”:  
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since original A was position 1).  
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since original R was position 2).  
- O is in position 5 (allowed, since original O was position 3).  

This fits all constraints.  
Another candidate: “TORAH” – but H is uncommon.  
“TORAI” – I is new, but “TORAI” is obscure.  
“RATIO” seems the best balance.  

But let’s try “RATIO”.Based on the feedback that A, R, and O are in the word but not in their original positions, and S and E are not in the word, I will test new positions for A, R, O and introduce two new letters (T and I) to maximize information gain.

Another candidate: MARON (but MARON is a surname, less common).
CALOR seems more likely.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters while avoiding repeats. 

Some good first guesses include:
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So the secret word contains A, R, O, but not S or E.  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, E  
Letters we know ARE in the word (but positions unknown): A, R, O  

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, R, O plus two other letters (not S or E).  
Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are already confirmed, E is ruled out).

Let’s try a word that places A, R, O in new positions and introduces two new consonants.  
A common pattern is to use A, R, O plus T and N.  
A word that fits: “RATIO” – but it has I and T, and we already know O is in the word. However, “RATIO” has A in position 2, R in position 1, T in position 3, I in position 4, O in position 5. This tests new positions for A, R, O and introduces T and I.  
Another option is “TAROC” – but C is less common.  
A better balanced choice is “RATIO”.

But let’s verify:  
- Must contain A, R, O.  
- Must not contain S or E.  
- Must be a valid 5-letter word.  
“RATIO” is valid and meets all criteria.  
However, let’s pick a word that spreads the known letters more evenly.  
Another candidate: “TROAK” – but K is uncommon.  
“ROAST” – but S is ruled out.  
“TORAH” – H is uncommon.  
“TAROK” – K is uncommon.  
“TORAI” – I is a vowel we haven’t tested yet, but “TORAI” is valid.  

But to maximize new letter coverage, let’s use two new consonants.  
A good choice: “TARON” – but N is common.  
“TARON” is valid.  

However, “TARON” is a valid word meaning a unit of measurement, but let’s pick something more common.  
“TAROC” is a variant spelling of tarot cards, but C is less common.  
“TROAK” is obscure.  
“TORAI” is obscure.  
“TARON” is acceptable but not super common.  

A better common word: “RATIO” – valid, common, tests new positions for A, R, O, and introduces I and T.  

But let’s double-check:  
- A is in word, not position 1.  
- R is in word, not position 2.  
- O is in word, not position 3.  

In “RATIO”:  
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since original A was position 1).  
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since original R was position 2).  
- O is in position 5 (allowed, since original O was position 3).  

This fits all constraints.  
Another candidate: “TORAH” – but H is uncommon.  
“TORAI” – I is new, but “TORAI” is obscure.  
“RATIO” seems the best balance.  

But let’s try “RATIO”.Based on the feedback that A, R, and O are in the word but not in their original positions, and S and E are not in the word, I will test new positions for A, R, O and introduce two new letters (T and I) to maximize information gain.

Guess 2: RATIO -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on RATIO:
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A(✓): A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- T(x): T is not in the word.
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
Letters in the word: A (fixed at position 2), R, O
Letters NOT in the word: S, E, T, I
Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Positions we know:
- Position 2 = A
- R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2 (from AROSE and RATIO feedback)
- O is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5 (from AROSE and RATIO feedback)

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2
- R somewhere (positions 3,4,5)
- O somewhere (positions 1,2,4) but position 2 is A, so positions 1 or 4
- No S, E, T, I
- Two more letters from the remaining pool

Possible patterns:
- O A R _ _
- _ A R O _
- _ A R _ O
- O A _ A R
- etc.

Let's try to find a common word that fits. One candidate is ""CRAVO"" but that's not valid. Another is ""GRAVO"" - not valid. ""BRAVO"" is valid, let's check:
- B, R, A, V, O
- A is in position 2 (correct)
- R is in position 2? No, position 2 is A. So R must be in 3,4, or 5. In BRAVO, R is in position 2 - that's wrong.
  
Next candidate: ""DRAVO"" - invalid. ""FRAVO"" - invalid. ""GRAFO"" - invalid. ""LARDO"" - valid:
- L, A, R, D, O
- A in position 2 (correct)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- O in position 5 - but O cannot be in position 5 (from RATIO feedback: O was in position 5 and marked (-), so O is in word but not in position 5). So LARDO is invalid.

Next: ""CARRO"" - invalid. ""MORAL"" - but A is in position 2, so ""MORAL"" has A in position 4 - wrong. ""ORAL"" is 4 letters.

Next: ""FARON"" - invalid. ""GAROL"" - invalid. ""HARPO"" - invalid. ""JARDO"" - invalid. ""KARDO"" - invalid. ""LARDO"" already checked. ""MARCO"" - valid:
- M, A, R, C, O
- A in position 2 (correct)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- O in position 5 - but O cannot be in position 5 (from RATIO feedback), so MARCO is invalid.

Next: ""PAPAR"" - invalid. ""MORAY"" - invalid. ""VAPOR"" - valid:
- V, A, P, O, R
- A in position 2 (correct)
- O in position 4 (allowed)
- R in position 5 (allowed)
- Letters used: V, P - both allowed
- No S, E, T, I
This seems valid.

Let's verify:
- Position 1: V (unknown)
- Position 2: A (matches ✓)
- Position 3: P (unknown)
- Position 4: O (must be in word, position 4 is allowed)
- Position 5: R (must be in word, position 5 is allowed)
This fits all constraints.Based on the feedback:
- A is fixed in position 2.
- R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.
- O is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5.
- Letters S, E, T, I are eliminated.

A valid word that fits these constraints is VAPOR, where:
- A is in position 2 (correct).
- R is in position 5 (allowed).
- O is in position 4 (allowed).
- V and P are new letters not yet tested.

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me reconsider the vowel options. We have U as the only remaining vowel.

Possible patterns:
- _ A U O R → but O is already in position 4, so this would be _ A _ O R with U in position 3.
- _ A _ O R with U in position 3: _ A U O R → but this would be 5 letters: position 1, A, U, O, R → _ A U O R.

MAROR is valid and fits:
- M (position 1): not yet ruled out.
- A (position 2): ✓
- R (position 3): but R is already in position 5, and letters can repeat? Wait, the secret word could have repeated letters, but we have no info about repeats yet.

However, MAROR has R in position 3 and 5, which is possible. Let's verify:
- M: not ruled out.
- A: ✓
- R: but R is already in position 5, and we have no restriction against repeats.

MAROR seems the only valid candidate left.

But let me double-check: is MAROR a valid 5-letter English word? Yes, it is a Hebrew bitter herb used in Passover.

Therefore, the next guess should be MAROR.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that contains several of these common letters while avoiding repeats. 

Some good first guesses include:
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- STARE (uses S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 of the most common letters and gives good coverage of vowels and consonants.

<guess>AROSE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So the secret word contains A, R, O, but not S or E.  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, E  
Letters we know ARE in the word (but positions unknown): A, R, O  

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, R, O plus two other letters (not S or E).  
Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are already confirmed, E is ruled out).

Let’s try a word that places A, R, O in new positions and introduces two new consonants.  
A common pattern is to use A, R, O plus T and N.  
A word that fits: “RATIO” – but it has I and T, and we already know O is in the word. However, “RATIO” has A in position 2, R in position 1, T in position 3, I in position 4, O in position 5. This tests new positions for A, R, O and introduces T and I.  
Another option is “TAROC” – but C is less common.  
A better balanced choice is “RATIO”.

But let’s verify:  
- Must contain A, R, O.  
- Must not contain S or E.  
- Must be a valid 5-letter word.  
“RATIO” is valid and meets all criteria.  
However, let’s pick a word that spreads the known letters more evenly.  
Another candidate: “TROAK” – but K is uncommon.  
“ROAST” – but S is ruled out.  
“TORAH” – H is uncommon.  
“TAROK” – K is uncommon.  
“TORAI” – I is a vowel we haven’t tested yet, but “TORAI” is valid.  

But to maximize new letter coverage, let’s use two new consonants.  
A good choice: “TARON” – but N is common.  
“TARON” is valid.  

However, “TARON” is a valid word meaning a unit of measurement, but let’s pick something more common.  
“TAROC” is a variant spelling of tarot cards, but C is less common.  
“TROAK” is obscure.  
“TORAI” is obscure.  
“TARON” is acceptable but not super common.  

A better common word: “RATIO” – valid, common, tests new positions for A, R, O, and introduces I and T.  

But let’s double-check:  
- A is in word, not position 1.  
- R is in word, not position 2.  
- O is in word, not position 3.  

In “RATIO”:  
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since original A was position 1).  
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since original R was position 2).  
- O is in position 5 (allowed, since original O was position 3).  

This fits all constraints.  
Another candidate: “TORAH” – but H is uncommon.  
“TORAI” – I is new, but “TORAI” is obscure.  
“RATIO” seems the best balance.  

But let’s try “RATIO”.Based on the feedback that A, R, and O are in the word but not in their original positions, and S and E are not in the word, I will test new positions for A, R, O and introduce two new letters (T and I) to maximize information gain.

From the new feedback on RATIO:
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A(✓): A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- T(x): T is not in the word.
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
Letters in the word: A (fixed at position 2), R, O
Letters NOT in the word: S, E, T, I
Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Positions we know:
- Position 2 = A
- R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2 (from AROSE and RATIO feedback)
- O is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5 (from AROSE and RATIO feedback)

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2
- R somewhere (positions 3,4,5)
- O somewhere (positions 1,2,4) but position 2 is A, so positions 1 or 4
- No S, E, T, I
- Two more letters from the remaining pool

Possible patterns:
- O A R _ _
- _ A R O _
- _ A R _ O
- O A _ A R
- etc.

Let's try to find a common word that fits. One candidate is ""CRAVO"" but that's not valid. Another is ""GRAVO"" - not valid. ""BRAVO"" is valid, let's check:
- B, R, A, V, O
- A is in position 2 (correct)
- R is in position 2? No, position 2 is A. So R must be in 3,4, or 5. In BRAVO, R is in position 2 - that's wrong.
  
Next candidate: ""DRAVO"" - invalid. ""FRAVO"" - invalid. ""GRAFO"" - invalid. ""LARDO"" - valid:
- L, A, R, D, O
- A in position 2 (correct)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- O in position 5 - but O cannot be in position 5 (from RATIO feedback: O was in position 5 and marked (-), so O is in word but not in position 5). So LARDO is invalid.

Next: ""CARRO"" - invalid. ""MORAL"" - but A is in position 2, so ""MORAL"" has A in position 4 - wrong. ""ORAL"" is 4 letters.

Next: ""FARON"" - invalid. ""GAROL"" - invalid. ""HARPO"" - invalid. ""JARDO"" - invalid. ""KARDO"" - invalid. ""LARDO"" already checked. ""MARCO"" - valid:
- M, A, R, C, O
- A in position 2 (correct)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- O in position 5 - but O cannot be in position 5 (from RATIO feedback), so MARCO is invalid.

Next: ""PAPAR"" - invalid. ""MORAY"" - invalid. ""VAPOR"" - valid:
- V, A, P, O, R
- A in position 2 (correct)
- O in position 4 (allowed)
- R in position 5 (allowed)
- Letters used: V, P - both allowed
- No S, E, T, I
This seems valid.

Let's verify:
- Position 1: V (unknown)
- Position 2: A (matches ✓)
- Position 3: P (unknown)
- Position 4: O (must be in word, position 4 is allowed)
- Position 5: R (must be in word, position 5 is allowed)
This fits all constraints.Based on the feedback:
- A is fixed in position 2.
- R is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.
- O is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5.
- Letters S, E, T, I are eliminated.

A valid word that fits these constraints is VAPOR, where:
- A is in position 2 (correct).
- R is in position 5 (allowed).
- O is in position 4 (allowed).
- V and P are new letters not yet tested.

- C A N O R → CANOR (invalid)
- C A L O R → CALOR
- C A R O N → CARON (invalid)
- C A R O T → CAROT (invalid)
- C A R O R → CALOR

CALOR is a valid word meaning heat, and it fits the pattern _ A _ O R with C in position 1 and L in position 3. Letters C and L have not been ruled out.

Another candidate: MARON (but MARON is a surname, less common).
CALOR seems more likely.

Let's verify:
- C (position 1): not yet ruled out.
- A (position 2): ✓
- L (position 3): not yet ruled out.
- O (position 4): ✓
- R (position 5): ✓

Letters used: C, A, L, O, R. None of these are in the eliminated list.Based on the latest feedback, positions 2, 4, and 5 are locked as A, O, R respectively. The remaining letters must come from the still-allowed set. The pattern _ A _ O R is satisfied by ""CALOR"" (C in position 1, L in position 3).

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the latest feedback on CALOR:
- C(x) → C is NOT in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- L(x) → L is NOT in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- R(✓) → R is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So far we know:
- Positions 2, 4, 5 are fixed: A, O, R respectively.
- Letters NOT in the word: S, E, T, I, V, P, C, L.
- Remaining positions to fill: 1 and 3.
- Allowed letters for positions 1 and 3: any letter not yet ruled out (excluding S, E, T, I, V, P, C, L).

Still-allowed consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.
Still-allowed vowels: U (A and O are already used, E is out).

We need two letters for positions 1 and 3. Common remaining choices:
- Position 1: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N
- Position 3: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, U

Looking for common 5-letter words with pattern _ A _ O R:
- B A _ O R → B A D O R (invalid), B A G O R (invalid), B A H O R (invalid)
- D A _ O R → D A B O R (invalid), D A G O R (invalid), D A M O R (invalid)
- F A _ O R → F A M O R (invalid)
- G A _ O R → G A M O R (invalid)
- H A _ O R → H A M O R (invalid)
- K A _ O R → K A M O R (invalid)
- M A _ O R → M A B O R (invalid), M A D O R (invalid), M A G O R (invalid)
- N A _ O R → N A B O R (invalid), N A G O R (invalid), N A M O R (invalid)

Wait, let's list valid English words:
- B A M O R → BAMOR (invalid)
- D A M O R → DAMOR (invalid)
- F A M O R → FAMOR (invalid)
- G A M O R → GAMOR (invalid)
- H A M O R → HAMOR (invalid)
- K A M O R → KAMOR (invalid)
- M A B O R → MABOR (invalid)
- M A D O R → MADOR (invalid)
- N A B O R → NABOR (invalid)
- N A G O R → NAGOR (invalid)
- N A M O R → NAMOR (invalid)

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me reconsider the vowel options. We have U as the only remaining vowel.

Possible patterns:
- _ A U O R → but O is already in position 4, so this would be _ A _ O R with U in position 3.
- _ A _ O R with U in position 3: _ A U O R → but this would be 5 letters: position 1, A, U, O, R → _ A U O R.

Looking for valid words:
- B A U O R → BAOOR (invalid)
- D A U O R → DAUOR (invalid)
- F A U O R → FAUOR (invalid)
- G A U O R → GAUOR (invalid)
- H A U O R → HAUOR (invalid)
- K A U O R → KAUOR (invalid)
- M A U O R → MAUOR (invalid)
- N A U O R → NAUOR (invalid)

None of these are valid. Let me check if I missed any consonants. The remaining consonants are B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, W, X, Y, Z.

Another approach: look for words ending in A O R with two letters before:
- B A R O R → BAROR (invalid)
- D A R O R → DAROR (invalid)
- F A R O R → FAROR (invalid)
- G A R O R → GAROR (invalid)
- H A R O R → HAROR (invalid)
- K A R O R → KAROR (invalid)
- M A R O R → MAROR (valid - a bitter herb)
- N A R O R → NAROR (invalid)

MAROR is valid and fits:
- M (position 1): not yet ruled out.
- A (position 2): ✓
- R (position 3): but R is already in position 5, and letters can repeat? Wait, the secret word could have repeated letters, but we have no info about repeats yet.

However, MAROR has R in position 3 and 5, which is possible. Let's verify:
- M: not ruled out.
- A: ✓
- R: but R is already in position 5, and we have no restriction against repeats.
- O: ✓
- R: ✓

This seems acceptable.

Alternative: look for other words:
- B A M O R → BAMOR (invalid)
- D A M O R → DAMOR (invalid)
- F A M O R → FAMOR (invalid)
- G A M O R → GAMOR (invalid)
- H A M O R → HAMOR (invalid)
- K A M O R → KAMOR (invalid)
- N A M O R → NAMOR (invalid)

MAROR seems the only valid candidate left.

But let me double-check: is MAROR a valid 5-letter English word? Yes, it is a Hebrew bitter herb used in Passover.

Therefore, the next guess should be MAROR.From the feedback, positions 2, 4, and 5 are fixed as A, O, R respectively. Positions 1 and 3 must be filled with letters not yet ruled out (excluding S, E, T, I, V, P, C, L). The only valid English word fitting the pattern _ A _ O R with remaining letters is MAROR.

- R(✓) → R is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the word is now fully determined except for the positions of R. We know:
- Position 1: M
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: must be a letter that is NOT R (from RATIO feedback: R is not in position 3)
- Position 4: O
- Position 5: R

The pattern is: M A _ O R

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits M A _ O R. The only common letter that fits in position 3 is N (forming MANOR), but we need to check if N has been ruled out. From previous guesses, N has not been tested yet, so it is still allowed.

Therefore, the word must be MANOR.",Guess 6: MANOR -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) N(x) O(✓) R(✓),FAIL
