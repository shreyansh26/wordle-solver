For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels are present and their positions, as well as whether R or S are in the word. 

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is another strong first guess with common letters. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better due to the inclusion of O, which is a common vowel not present in ""SLATE"".

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – not in the word at all  
- R (-) – in the word, but not in position 2  
- O (-) – in the word, but not in position 3  
- S (-) – in the word, but not in position 4  
- E (x) – not in the word at all  

So the secret word:
- Contains R, O, S somewhere (but not in positions 2, 3, 4 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A or E

Good next guesses should:
1. Re-use R, O, S in different positions
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tried yet (e.g., T, L, N, I, C, H, etc.)
3. Avoid A and E

A strong candidate is “STORE”:
- It moves R to position 3, O to position 2, S to position 1.
- Adds T and E, but E is already ruled out → discard.
  
Next try “FRONT”:
- F, N are new letters.
- R moves to 2, O to 3, T is new.
But O is not in position 3 (from feedback), so this could still work.

Better: “CROON” – but O repeats, and we already know O is in the word once.

Another: “STORY”:
- S moves to 1, T, O to 2, R to 4, Y new.
- R was not in position 2 (good), now in 4 – acceptable.
- O was not in 3, now in 2 – acceptable.
- S was not in 4, now in 1 – acceptable.
- Introduces T and Y.

This seems optimal.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - Letters in word: R, O, S (but not in positions 2, 3, 4 respectively)
   - Letters NOT in word: A, E

2. STORY → S(-) T(-) O(-) R(-) Y(x)
   - Letters in word: S, T, O, R (but not in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively)
   - Letters NOT in word: Y

So the secret word:
- Must contain exactly the letters {R, O, S, T} plus one more letter (since it’s 5 letters).
- Cannot contain A, E, Y.
- Position constraints:
  - R cannot be in 2, 4
  - O cannot be in 3
  - S cannot be in 1, 4
  - T cannot be in 1, 2, 3

We need a 5-letter word that uses R, O, S, T plus one new letter (from remaining common letters: I, N, L, C, H, U, D, etc.), while respecting the positional bans.

Let’s list possible positions for each letter:
- R: 1, 3, 5
- O: 1, 2, 4, 5
- S: 2, 3, 5
- T: 5 (only remaining spot that satisfies T not in 1-3)

From the constraints, T must be in position 5.

So the word ends with T: _ _ _ _ T

Now we need to place R, O, S in positions 1-4 with the remaining constraints:
- R can be 1, 3
- O can be 1, 2, 4
- S can be 2, 3

Let’s try combinations:

Option 1: R in 1, O in 2, S in 3 → R O S _ T → need one more letter in position 4. Possible letters left: I, N, L, C, H, etc. Common word: ""ROSCI"" – but not valid.
Option 2: R in 1, S in 2, O in 4 → R S _ O T → need letter in 3. ""RSOOT"" – invalid.
Option 3: S in 2, R in 3, O in 1 → O S R _ T → ""OSRT_"" – need letter in 4. ""OSRIT"" – invalid.
Option 4: R in 3, O in 2, S in 5 – but S can’t be 5 (from STORY feedback S(-) means S not in 1, but in 5 it’s allowed). Wait, S was not in 4 (from AROSE), so 5 is fine. But word must end with T, so S can’t be 5. Discard.
Option 5: R in 3, O in 1, S in 2 → O S R _ T → same as above, need valid word.
Option 6: R in 1, O in 4, S in 2 → R S _ O T → need letter in 3. ""RSOOT"" invalid.
Option 7: R in 3, O in 5 – but word ends with T, so O can’t be 5. Discard.
Option 8: R in 1, O in 2, S in 5 – but S can’t be 5 because word ends with T. Discard.
Option 9: R in 3, O in 2, S in 5 – same issue.

Wait, let’s list valid placements with T fixed at 5:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Letters to place: R, O, S, plus one new letter (let’s call it X)
Constraints:
- R: 1, 3
- O: 1, 2, 4
- S: 2, 3
- X: any remaining spot

Possible valid combinations:

1. R in 1, O in 2, S in 3 → R O S _ T → need X in 4. Possible X: I, N, L, C, H, etc. Common word: ""ROSCI"" – invalid.
2. R in 1, S in 2, O in 4 → R S _ O T → need X in 3. ""RSXOT"" – need valid word. ""RSN OT"" → ""RSNOT"" – invalid.
3. S in 2, R in 3, O in 1 → O S R _ T → need X in 4. ""OSRXT"" – invalid.
4. R in 3, O in 2, S in 5 – but S can’t be 5 (word ends with T). Discard.
5. R in 3, O in 1, S in 2 → O S R _ T → same as 3, invalid.
6. R in 1, O in 4, S in 2 → R S _ O T → same as 2, invalid.
7. R in 1, O in 2, S in 5 – same issue.

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words. Let’s consider that the fifth letter could be a repeated letter or a less common one. But we need a valid English word.

Alternative approach: look for real words ending in T with R, O, S plus one more letter.

Possible words:
- ""STORY"" – already guessed.
- ""ROAST"" – but A is excluded.
- ""TROOS"" – invalid.
- ""STROK"" – invalid.
- ""STROP"" – P is new, but let’s check constraints:
  - S in 1: from STORY feedback S(-) means S not in 1. So S can’t be 1. Discard ""STROP"".
- ""TROCK"" – invalid.
- ""TRODE"" – E excluded.
- ""TROOP"" – only two O’s, but we don’t know if O repeats.
- ""TROSE"" – E excluded.
- ""TROCK"" – invalid.
- ""TROTS"" – S can’t be 5, and word ends with T, so S can’t be 5. Discard.

Wait, let’s list all 5-letter words ending in T with letters R, O, S plus one new letter, excluding A, E, Y.

Valid English words:
- ""STROK"" – invalid.
- ""TROCK"" – invalid.
- ""TROOP"" – possible, but has two O’s.
- ""TROSE"" – E excluded.
- ""TROTS"" – S can’t be 5, word ends with T, so S can’t be 5. Discard.

This seems problematic. Maybe the fifth letter is a repeated letter. Let’s consider ""TROOP"":
- T R O O P – but P is new, and we have to check constraints:
  - T at 5: OK
  - R at 2: but R cannot be at 2 (from AROSE feedback R(-) means R not at 2). Discard.

Another word: ""TROCK"" – invalid.

Wait, perhaps the word is ""STROP"" – but S cannot be at 1 (from STORY feedback S(-) means S not at 1). Discard.

Next: ""TROCK"" – invalid.

This suggests we might need to reconsider our placement. Let’s try ""ROOST"":
- R O O S T – but O repeats, and we don’t know if O repeats.
- R at 1: allowed (R not banned at 1)
- O at 2: allowed (O not banned at 2)
- S at 4: but from AROSE feedback S(-) means S not at 4. Discard.

Another word: ""STOIC"" – ends with C, not T. Discard.

Wait, let’s think differently: the fifth letter could be a consonant we haven’t tried, like N, L, C, H, etc.

Let’s try ""SNORT"":
- S N O R T
- T at 5: OK
- S at 1: but S cannot be at 1 (STORY feedback S(-) means S not at 1). Discard.

""SNORT"" – S at 1 is banned.

""FRONT"" – already considered.

""CRONE"" – E banned.

""CRONY"" – Y banned.

""CRISP"" – P new, but:
- C, R, I, S, P
- R at 2: banned (from AROSE R(-) means R not at 2). Discard.

""PRIST"" – invalid.

""SPRIT"" – S at 1 banned.

""TRIOS"" – ends with S, not T.

""TORUS"" – ends with S.

""TORCH"" – ends with H.

""TORCH"" – let’s check:
- T O R C H
- T at 1: but T cannot be at 1 (STORY feedback T(-) means T not at 1). Discard.

""TORCH"" – T at 1 banned.

""TORUS"" – ends with S.

""TORON"" – invalid.

""TORCH"" – T at 1 banned.

This is tricky. Let’s list all valid words ending in T with letters R, O, S plus one new letter, excluding A, E, Y, and respecting positional bans.

After careful consideration, the only valid word that fits is ""STROK"" – but it’s not in standard word lists. Another possibility is ""TROCK"" – also invalid.

Wait, let’s try ""TROOP"" again:
- T R O O P
- T at 5: OK
- R at 2: banned (from AROSE R(-) means R not at 2). Discard.

""STROK"" – invalid.

""STRODE"" – E banned.

""STROPH"" – invalid.

""STROVE"" – E banned.

""STROCK"" – invalid.

""STROPH"" – invalid.

""STROPH"" – invalid.

This suggests we might need to use a repeated letter or reconsider. The only valid word I can find is ""TROOP"", but R is at 2 which is banned.

Let me re-examine the constraints carefully:

From AROSE:
- R not at 2
- O not at 3
- S not at 4

From STORY:
- S not at 1
- T not at 1,2,3
- O not at 3
- R not at 4

So T must be at 5.

Now, with T at 5, we have positions 1-4 to fill with R, O, S plus one new letter (X).

Possible valid placements:

1. R at 1, O at 2, S at 3 → R O S _ T → need X at 4. Possible X: I, N, L, C, H, etc. Common word: ""ROSCI"" – invalid.
2. R at 1, S at 2, O at 4 → R S _ O T → need X at 3. ""RSXOT"" – need valid word. ""RSN OT"" → ""RSN OT"" – invalid.
3. S at 2, R at 3, O at 1 → O S R _ T → need X at 4. ""OSRXT"" – invalid.
4. R at 3, O at 2, S at 5 – but S can’t be 5. Discard.
5. R at 3, O at 1, S at 2 → O S R _ T → same as 3, invalid.
6. R at 1, O at 4, S at 2 → R S _ O T → same as 2, invalid.
7. R at 1, O at 2, S at 5 – same issue.

This seems impossible with standard words. Perhaps the word uses a repeated letter. Let’s try ""TROOP"" but R is at 2 which is banned.

Another approach: the fifth letter could be a repeated letter, like ""TROOP"" but R is banned at 2.

Wait, let’s try ""STROK"" – but S at 1 is banned.

""STROVE"" – E banned.

""STROPH"" – invalid.

""STROPH"" – invalid.

This is perplexing. Let me think of valid English words ending in T with R, O, S plus one new letter, excluding A, E, Y.

After careful search, the only valid word is ""TROOP"" but R is at 2 which is banned.

This suggests I might have missed something. Let me re-examine the constraints:

From STORY:
- T cannot be at 1,2,3 → must be at 4 or 5. Wait, original feedback says T(-) means T not in positions 1,2,3. So T can be at 4 or 5.

Ah! My earlier assumption that T must be at 5 is incorrect. T can be at 4 or 5.

This changes things. Let’s re-evaluate.

Now T can be at 4 or 5.

So possible word structures:

Case 1: T at 4
Positions: _ _ _ T _
Letters to place: R, O, S plus one new letter (X)
Constraints:
- R: not 2,4 → 1,3,5
- O: not 3 → 1,2,4,5
- S: not 1,4 → 2,3,5
- T at 4

So:
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Letters:   _ _ _ T _

We need to place R, O, S in 1,2,3,5 with constraints.

Possible placements:

a) R at 1, O at 2, S at 3 → R O S T _ → need X at 5. ""ROSTX"" – need valid word. ""ROSTI"" – invalid.
b) R at 1, S at 2, O at 3 → R S O T _ → need X at 5. ""RSOTX"" – invalid.
c) S at 2, R at 3, O at 1 → O S R T _ → need X at 5. ""OSRTX"" – invalid.
d) R at 3, O at 1, S at 2 → O S R T _ → same as c.
e) R at 5, O at 1, S at 2 → O S _ T R → need X at 3. ""OSXTR"" – invalid.
f) R at 5, S at 2, O at 1 → O S _ T R → same as e.
g) S at 5, R at 1, O at 2 → R O _ T S → need X at 3. ""ROXTS"" – invalid.
h) S at 5, O at 1, R at 3 → O _ R T S → need X at 2. ""OXR TS"" – invalid.

Case 2: T at 5
Positions: _ _ _ _ T
Letters to place: R, O, S plus one new letter (X)
Constraints:
- R: not 2,4 → 1,3,5
- O: not 3 → 1,2,4,5
- S: not 1,4 → 2,3,5
- T at 5

So:
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Letters:   _ _ _ _ T

We need to place R, O, S in 1,2,3,4 with constraints.

Possible placements:

a) R at 1, O at 2, S at 3 → R O S _ T → need X at 4. ""RO SX T"" – need valid word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels are present and their positions, as well as whether R or S are in the word. 

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is another strong first guess with common letters. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better due to the inclusion of O, which is a common vowel not present in ""SLATE"".

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – not in the word at all  
- R (-) – in the word, but not in position 2  
- O (-) – in the word, but not in position 3  
- S (-) – in the word, but not in position 4  
- E (x) – not in the word at all  

So the secret word:
- Contains R, O, S somewhere (but not in positions 2, 3, 4 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A or E

Good next guesses should:
1. Re-use R, O, S in different positions
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tried yet (e.g., T, L, N, I, C, H, etc.)
3. Avoid A and E

A strong candidate is “STORE”:
- It moves R to position 3, O to position 2, S to position 1.
- Adds T and E, but E is already ruled out → discard.
  
Next try “FRONT”:
- F, N are new letters.
- R moves to 2, O to 3, T is new.
But O is not in position 3 (from feedback), so this could still work.

Better: “CROON” – but O repeats, and we already know O is in the word once.

Another: “STORY”:
- S moves to 1, T, O to 2, R to 4, Y new.
- R was not in position 2 (good), now in 4 – acceptable.
- O was not in 3, now in 2 – acceptable.
- S was not in 4, now in 1 – acceptable.
- Introduces T and Y.

This seems optimal.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels are present and their positions, as well as whether R or S are in the word. 

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is another strong first guess with common letters. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better due to the inclusion of O, which is a common vowel not present in ""SLATE"".

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – not in the word at all  
- R (-) – in the word, but not in position 2  
- O (-) – in the word, but not in position 3  
- S (-) – in the word, but not in position 4  
- E (x) – not in the word at all  

So the secret word:
- Contains R, O, S somewhere (but not in positions 2, 3, 4 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A or E

Good next guesses should:
1. Re-use R, O, S in different positions
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tried yet (e.g., T, L, N, I, C, H, etc.)
3. Avoid A and E

A strong candidate is “STORE”:
- It moves R to position 3, O to position 2, S to position 1.
- Adds T and E, but E is already ruled out → discard.
  
Next try “FRONT”:
- F, N are new letters.
- R moves to 2, O to 3, T is new.
But O is not in position 3 (from feedback), so this could still work.

Better: “CROON” – but O repeats, and we already know O is in the word once.

Another: “STORY”:
- S moves to 1, T, O to 2, R to 4, Y new.
- R was not in position 2 (good), now in 4 – acceptable.
- O was not in 3, now in 2 – acceptable.
- S was not in 4, now in 1 – acceptable.
- Introduces T and Y.

This seems optimal.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels are present and their positions, as well as whether R or S are in the word. 

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is another strong first guess with common letters. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better due to the inclusion of O, which is a common vowel not present in ""SLATE"".

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – not in the word at all  
- R (-) – in the word, but not in position 2  
- O (-) – in the word, but not in position 3  
- S (-) – in the word, but not in position 4  
- E (x) – not in the word at all  

So the secret word:
- Contains R, O, S somewhere (but not in positions 2, 3, 4 respectively)
- Does NOT contain A or E

Good next guesses should:
1. Re-use R, O, S in different positions
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tried yet (e.g., T, L, N, I, C, H, etc.)
3. Avoid A and E

A strong candidate is “STORE”:
- It moves R to position 3, O to position 2, S to position 1.
- Adds T and E, but E is already ruled out → discard.
  
Next try “FRONT”:
- F, N are new letters.
- R moves to 2, O to 3, T is new.
But O is not in position 3 (from feedback), so this could still work.

Better: “CROON” – but O repeats, and we already know O is in the word once.

Another: “STORY”:
- S moves to 1, T, O to 2, R to 4, Y new.
- R was not in position 2 (good), now in 4 – acceptable.
- O was not in 3, now in 2 – acceptable.
- S was not in 4, now in 1 – acceptable.
- Introduces T and Y.

This seems optimal.

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

1. Letters **not** in the word: A, E, Y  
2. Letters **in** the word but in **wrong positions** so far:  
   - R, O, S, T (each has been marked “-” in every position tried so far)  
3. Positions ruled out for these letters:  
   - R cannot be in positions 2 or 4  
   - O cannot be in positions 3 or 2  
   - S cannot be in positions 4 or 1  
   - T cannot be in positions 2 or 1  

We need a word that:
- contains R, O, S, T exactly once each  
- places them in **new** positions (not ruled out above)  
- introduces one new letter (must be from remaining common letters: I, N, L, C, H, etc.)  
- avoids A, E, Y entirely  

Candidate structure:  
- R must go in 1, 3, or 5  
- O must go in 1, 4, or 5  
- S must go in 2, 3, or 5  
- T must go in 3, 4, or 5  

A valid arrangement satisfying all constraints is:  
- Position 1: O (new for O)  
- Position 2: S (new for S)  
- Position 3: R (new for R)  
- Position 4: T (new for T)  
- Position 5: I (new vowel not ruled out)

This gives the word **OSTRI**, but that’s not a valid English word.  
Next valid English word fitting the constraints: **ROIST** – also invalid.  
Re-evaluate: **STORY** already used, **TROOP** repeats O, **SPORT** repeats P, **TORUS** repeats U.  

Valid English word that fits: **STORY** already used.  
Try **STROK** – invalid.  
Valid: **STOIC** – uses I and C, positions: S(2), T(3), O(4), R(5), I(1), C(4) – but O and C in 4, R in 5.  
Check positions:  
- S in 2 (allowed)  
- T in 3 (allowed)  
- O in 4 (allowed)  
- R in 5 (allowed)  
- I and C new letters, both allowed.  

**STOIC** is a valid English word and satisfies all constraints.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: A, E, Y, I, C  
Letters that ARE in the word but are in wrong positions: R, O, S, T  
Positions ruled out for each:
- R: not 2 or 4  
- O: not 3 or 2  
- S: not 4 or 1  
- T: not 2 or 1  

We need a 5-letter English word that:
- contains R, O, S, T exactly once each  
- places each of these letters in a position NOT previously ruled out  
- uses one new letter (must be from remaining common letters: N, L, U, H, etc.)  

Valid positions for each required letter:
R: 1, 3, 5  
O: 1, 4, 5  
S: 2, 3, 5  
T: 3, 4, 5  

One possible arrangement:
- Position 1: O (new for O)  
- Position 2: S (new for S)  
- Position 3: R (new for R)  
- Position 4: T (new for T)  
- Position 5: N (new letter)  

This gives the word **OSTRN**, but that’s not a valid English word.  
Next valid English word fitting the constraints: **STORY** already used.  
Try **TORON** – invalid.  
Valid word: **ROOST** – repeats O and S, invalid.  
Valid word: **STORM** – uses M (new), positions: S(2), T(3), O(4), R(5), M(1).  
Check constraints:
- S in 2 (allowed)  
- T in 3 (allowed)  
- O in 4 (allowed)
