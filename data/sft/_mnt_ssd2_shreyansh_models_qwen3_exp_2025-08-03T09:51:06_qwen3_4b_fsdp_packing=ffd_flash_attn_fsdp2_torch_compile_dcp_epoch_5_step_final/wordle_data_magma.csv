For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should have:
- Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L
- Common vowels like A, E, I, O, U

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and vowels, which will help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

But let’s check “CAMPY” – it’s valid. Another option is “CANNY” – but N is repeated, and we already have N in CANNY, but we haven’t ruled out N yet. However, “CANNY” uses C, N, N, Y – but N is allowed.

Wait, let’s pick “CANNY” – it uses C, N, Y (all new), and A is fixed in position 2. This seems optimal.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should have:
- Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L
- Common vowels like A, E, I, O, U

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and vowels, which will help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

“PAPAW” uses P, P, A, W – W is new, but PAPAW is a valid word.

However, let’s pick a word that introduces as many new common letters as possible. “CHALK” comes to mind: C, H, A, L, K. But L is excluded.
“CAMPY” – C, M, P, Y – uses C, M, P, Y (Y is new), and A is fixed in position 2. This seems good.

But let’s check “CAMPY” – it’s valid. Another option is “CANNY” – but N is repeated, and we already have N in CANNY, but we haven’t ruled out N yet. However, “CANNY” uses C, N, N, Y – but N is allowed.

Wait, let’s pick “CANNY” – it uses C, N, Y (all new), and A is fixed in position 2. This seems optimal.

But let me double-check: CANNY – C, A, N, N, Y. A is in position 2, and C, N, Y are new letters. This seems like the best guess.

From the new feedback on CANNY:
- C(x) – C is not in the word.
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- Y(x) – Y is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O, C, N, Y
- Letter definitely in the word and fixed in position 2: A
- Remaining unused common letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word with A in position 2. Good candidates should use new letters we haven’t tried yet. Let’s list some possibilities:
- B A _ _ _ (like BAGGY, BANJO – but N and O are excluded)
- F A _ _ _ (like FANCY – C and Y are excluded)
- G A _ _ _ (like GAUDY – D and Y are excluded)
- H A _ _ _ (like HABIT – I and T are excluded)
- K A _ _ _ (like KAYAK – K, A, Y, K – Y is excluded)
- M A _ _ _ (like MANGO – O is excluded)
- P A _ _ _ (like PAPAW – P, A, P, A, W – W is new)
- U A _ _ _ (like UMBRA – U, M, B, R – R is excluded)

Looking at these, “PAPAW” uses P, P, A, W – but W is new and P is repeated. Another option is “GUMMY” – but U, M, M, Y – Y is excluded. 

Wait, let’s try “BAGGY” – but G and Y are new. However, B, A, G, G, Y – Y is excluded. 

Another option: “FUGUE” – but U, G, E – E is excluded. 

Let’s think of words with A in position 2 and using remaining letters. “PAWNS” – but S is excluded. 

“BAMBO” – but O is excluded. 

“HABAN” – but N is excluded. 

“GAMMA” – but M, M are new, and A is repeated. 

“GAMMA” uses G, A, M, M, A – positions: G(1), A(2), M(3), M(4), A(5). We know A is in position 2, and G, M are new letters. This seems valid.

But let me check if there are better options. “GAMMA” is valid and uses G, M (both new). 

Another option: “GUMMY” – but Y is excluded. 

“PAWNS” – S is excluded. 

“BAGGY” – Y is excluded. 

“FUGUE” – E is excluded. 

“HABAN” – N is excluded. 

“PAPAW” – W is new, but P is repeated. 

“GAMMA” seems the best so far. 

However, let me think of other words: “GAMMA”, “GUMMY” (invalid), “HABAN” (invalid), “KAYAK” (invalid), “MAGMA” – uses M, M, G, A, M – positions: M(1), A(2), G(3), M(4), A(5). This uses M, G (both new) and A in position 2. 

“MAGMA” seems even better as it uses M, G, and A in position 2 without repeats.

Let me confirm: MAGMA – M, A, G, M, A. A is in position 2, and M, G are new letters. This seems optimal.

But wait, is MAGMA a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it means a type of rock or a metaphorical term for a crowd.

So, “MAGMA” is the best next guess.

Based on the feedback so far, we know:
- A is fixed in position 2.
- Letters eliminated: S, L, T, E, R, D, I, O, C, N, Y.
- Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

The word “MAGMA” uses:
- M (position 1)
- A (position 2 – confirmed correct)
- G (position 3)
- M (position 4)
- A (position 5)

This tests two new consonants (M, G) while keeping A in place.
