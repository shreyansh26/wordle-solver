For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should ideally include several of these.

Looking at combinations, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This gives us good coverage of common vowels and consonants to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" is particularly strong due to its mix of vowels and common consonants. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess to maximize information gain.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- O is in the correct position (3rd letter).
- A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word has the form: _ _ O _ _
2. The letters A, R, S, E are excluded.
3. We still need to test common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

A good second guess should:
- Keep O in position 3.
- Introduce new common letters not yet tested (e.g., L, N, T, I, U, C, etc.).
- Avoid any of the already excluded letters (A, R, S, E).

Possible candidates:
- ""POINT"" – but P, I, N, T are all good, but O is already confirmed in 3rd spot, so this would be O in 3rd place (P O I N T) – but that’s not correct.
- ""CLOTH"" – but H is less common.
- ""MOUND"" – but D is less common.
- ""CLOUD"" – but U is a vowel we haven’t tested.
- ""BOUND"" – B, U, N, D are all untested except for O.

However, ""CLOUD"" has C, L, U, D which are all new letters, and keeps O in 3rd spot. This seems optimal.

But let’s check: C, L, U, D, O – none of A, R, S, E appear, and O is in the correct position. This looks good.

Another candidate: ""CLOUT"" – C, L, O, U, T. This also keeps O in position 3 and introduces new letters.

Between ""CLOUD"" and ""CLOUT"", ""CLOUT"" introduces T which is very common, so I’ll go with ""CLOUT"".

So far we have:

Allowed letters (alphabet minus the forbidden set):  
B, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We still need to test several consonants and the only remaining vowel is I and Y.

We want a word that:
1. Keeps O in the 3rd position.
2. Uses only the allowed letters.
3. Tests as many new common letters as possible.

Good remaining consonants: B, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y  
Good remaining vowels: I, Y

Let’s look for a word that uses common combinations.  
Possible candidates:
- “PHONY” – but P, H, N, Y: N is forbidden.
- “BINGO” – but I, N, G, O: N is forbidden.
- “VIRGO” – but V, I, R, G, O: R is forbidden.
- “KIPPO” – but K, I, P, P, O: K, I, P are allowed, but double P is less informative.
- “BIFRO” – but F, R, O: R is forbidden.
- “HYPO” – but H, Y, P, O: all allowed, but it’s 4 letters.
- “BYPY” – too short.
- “PIGGY” – too long.
- “PIGMY” – but M is forbidden.

Actually, let’s list 5-letter words that fit _ _ O _ _ and use only allowed letters.

Some possibilities:
- “BINGO” – N is forbidden.
- “FINGO” – N is forbidden.
- “HINGO” – N is forbidden.
- “VINGO” – N is forbidden.
- “PINGO” – N is forbidden.
- “WINGO” – N is forbidden.
- “YINGO” – N is forbidden.

Next, try consonants:

- “BIGFO” – R is forbidden.
- “BIGGO” – G is allowed, but double G is less informative.
- “BIGYO” – Y is allowed, but double G is less informative.
- “BIGWO” – W is allowed, but double G is less informative.

Let’s try “BIGYO”:
- B, I, G, Y, O: all allowed letters, keeps O in 3rd position, tests I, G, Y, B.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should ideally include several of these.

Looking at combinations, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This gives us good coverage of common vowels and consonants to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" is particularly strong due to its mix of vowels and common consonants. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess to maximize information gain.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- O is in the correct position (3rd letter).
- A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word has the form: _ _ O _ _
2. The letters A, R, S, E are excluded.
3. We still need to test common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

A good second guess should:
- Keep O in position 3.
- Introduce new common letters not yet tested (e.g., L, N, T, I, U, C, etc.).
- Avoid any of the already excluded letters (A, R, S, E).

Possible candidates:
- ""POINT"" – but P, I, N, T are all good, but O is already confirmed in 3rd spot, so this would be O in 3rd place (P O I N T) – but that’s not correct.
- ""CLOTH"" – but H is less common.
- ""MOUND"" – but D is less common.
- ""CLOUD"" – but U is a vowel we haven’t tested.
- ""BOUND"" – B, U, N, D are all untested except for O.

However, ""CLOUD"" has C, L, U, D which are all new letters, and keeps O in 3rd spot. This seems optimal.

But let’s check: C, L, U, D, O – none of A, R, S, E appear, and O is in the correct position. This looks good.

Another candidate: ""CLOUT"" – C, L, O, U, T. This also keeps O in position 3 and introduces new letters.

Between ""CLOUD"" and ""CLOUT"", ""CLOUT"" introduces T which is very common, so I’ll go with ""CLOUT"".

2. The letters A, R, S, E, C, L, U, T are all absent.
3. The remaining alphabet (minus those 8 letters) contains: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in the 3rd position.
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.
- Introduces as many new common letters as possible to maximize information.

The most frequent remaining consonants are N, M, D, P, B, F, H, K.  
The remaining vowels are I and Y (since A, E, U are ruled out).

Let’s pick a word that places common letters in the remaining positions.  
A good candidate is “MOUND”:
- M, N, D are all common and untested.
- O is fixed in position 3.
- No forbidden letters appear.

“MOUND” fits all constraints.

- G is in the word but not in position 3 (it was in position 3 in “bigyo” and got “-”).
- Y is in the word but not in position 4 (it was in position 4 in “bigyo” and got “-”).

So G and Y must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We need a word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Contains both G and Y (since they are confirmed in the word).
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s list possible positions for G and Y:
- G could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- Y could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 4 because it was in position 4 and got “-”, so Y must be in 1, 2, or 5).

We need to fill the remaining spots with allowed letters (F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z).

Let’s try to construct words:
- G in 1, Y in 2: G Y O _ _ → need two more letters from allowed set. Possible: G Y O F K → “gyofk” (not a valid word).
- G in 1, Y in 5: G _ O _ Y → G F O K Y → “gfo ky” (invalid).
- G in 2, Y in 1: Y G O _ _ → Y G O F K → “y g o f k” (invalid).
- G in 2, Y in 5: _ G O _ Y → F G O K Y → “fgoky” (invalid).
- G in 4, Y in 1: Y _ O G _ → Y F O G K → “y fogk” (invalid).
- G in 4, Y in 2: _ Y O G _ → F Y O G K → “f y ogk” (invalid).
- G in 4, Y in 5: _ _ O G Y → F K O G Y → “fkog y” (invalid).
- G in 5, Y in 1: Y _ _ O G → Y F _ _ O G → “y f _ _ og” (invalid).

Let’s look for actual English words that fit _ _ O _ _ and contain G and Y with allowed letters.

Possible words:
- “phogy” – P, H, O, G, Y → all allowed, pattern _ _ O _ _ with O in 3, G in 4, Y in 5.
- “voghy” – V, O, G, H, Y → but O is in position 2, not 3.
- “kogoy” – K, O, G, O, Y → but O repeats and we don’t know if double O is allowed.
- “yoghy” – Y, O, G, H, Y → but Y repeats and O is in position 2.

“Phogy” seems valid:
- P, H, O, G, Y → all letters are allowed (P, H, G, Y are not forbidden; O is fixed in 3).
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _ → P H O G Y → O is in position 3, G in 4, Y in 5.
- This tests new letters P and H.

Let’s verify:
- P: not forbidden.
- H: not forbidden.
- O: fixed in 3.
- G: confirmed in word, not in 3 (it’s in 4).
- Y: confirmed in word, not in 4 (it’s in 5).

This seems like the best next guess.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should ideally include several of these.

Looking at combinations, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This gives us good coverage of common vowels and consonants to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" is particularly strong due to its mix of vowels and common consonants. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess to maximize information gain.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- O is in the correct position (3rd letter).
- A, R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word has the form: _ _ O _ _
2. The letters A, R, S, E are excluded.
3. We still need to test common consonants and vowels that haven’t been ruled out (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

A good second guess should:
- Keep O in position 3.
- Introduce new common letters not yet tested (e.g., L, N, T, I, U, C, etc.).
- Avoid any of the already excluded letters (A, R, S, E).

Possible candidates:
- ""POINT"" – but P, I, N, T are all good, but O is already confirmed in 3rd spot, so this would be O in 3rd place (P O I N T) – but that’s not correct.
- ""CLOTH"" – but H is less common.
- ""MOUND"" – but D is less common.
- ""CLOUD"" – but U is a vowel we haven’t tested.
- ""BOUND"" – B, U, N, D are all untested except for O.

However, ""CLOUD"" has C, L, U, D which are all new letters, and keeps O in 3rd spot. This seems optimal.

But let’s check: C, L, U, D, O – none of A, R, S, E appear, and O is in the correct position. This looks good.

Another candidate: ""CLOUT"" – C, L, O, U, T. This also keeps O in position 3 and introduces new letters.

Between ""CLOUD"" and ""CLOUT"", ""CLOUT"" introduces T which is very common, so I’ll go with ""CLOUT"".

From the two pieces of feedback we now know:

1. The word has the form _ _ O _ _  (O is fixed in the 3rd position).
2. The letters A, R, S, E, C, L, U, T are all absent.
3. The remaining alphabet (minus those 8 letters) contains: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in the 3rd position.
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.
- Introduces as many new common letters as possible to maximize information.

The most frequent remaining consonants are N, M, D, P, B, F, H, K.  
The remaining vowels are I and Y (since A, E, U are ruled out).

Let’s pick a word that places common letters in the remaining positions.  
A good candidate is “MOUND”:
- M, N, D are all common and untested.
- O is fixed in position 3.
- No forbidden letters appear.

“MOUND” fits all constraints.

So far we have:

- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- Forbidden letters: A, R, S, E, C, L, U, T, M, N, D

Allowed letters (alphabet minus the forbidden set):  
B, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We still need to test several consonants and the only remaining vowel is I and Y.

We want a word that:
1. Keeps O in the 3rd position.
2. Uses only the allowed letters.
3. Tests as many new common letters as possible.

Good remaining consonants: B, F, G, H, K, P, V, W, Y  
Good remaining vowels: I, Y

Let’s look for a word that uses common combinations.  
Possible candidates:
- “PHONY” – but P, H, N, Y: N is forbidden.
- “BINGO” – but I, N, G, O: N is forbidden.
- “VIRGO” – but V, I, R, G, O: R is forbidden.
- “KIPPO” – but K, I, P, P, O: K, I, P are allowed, but double P is less informative.
- “BIFRO” – but F, R, O: R is forbidden.
- “HYPO” – but H, Y, P, O: all allowed, but it’s 4 letters.
- “BYPY” – too short.
- “PIGGY” – too long.
- “PIGMY” – but M is forbidden.

Actually, let’s list 5-letter words that fit _ _ O _ _ and use only allowed letters.

Some possibilities:
- “BINGO” – N is forbidden.
- “FINGO” – N is forbidden.
- “HINGO” – N is forbidden.
- “VINGO” – N is forbidden.
- “PINGO” – N is forbidden.
- “WINGO” – N is forbidden.
- “YINGO” – N is forbidden.

Next, try consonants:
- “BIFRO” – R is forbidden.
- “BIGFO” – R is forbidden.
- “BIGGO” – G is allowed, but double G is less informative.
- “BIGYO” – Y is allowed, but double G is less informative.
- “BIGWO” – W is allowed, but double G is less informative.

Let’s try “BIGYO”:
- B, I, G, Y, O: all allowed letters, keeps O in 3rd position, tests I, G, Y, B.

This seems like a good next guess.

3. Allowed letters: F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
   (Y is still allowed even though it appeared as “-” in the last guess, because the “-” only means it’s in the word but not in that position; however, since Y appeared in position 4 with “-”, we know Y is somewhere else.)

We have:
- G is in the word but not in position 3 (it was in position 3 in “bigyo” and got “-”).
- Y is in the word but not in position 4 (it was in position 4 in “bigyo” and got “-”).

So G and Y must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We need a word that:
- Has O in position 3.
- Contains both G and Y (since they are confirmed in the word).
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s list possible positions for G and Y:
- G could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
- Y could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 4 because it was in position 4 and got “-”, so Y must be in 1, 2, or 5).

We need to fill the remaining spots with allowed letters (F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z).

Let’s try to construct words:
- G in 1, Y in 2: G Y O _ _ → need two more letters from allowed set. Possible: G Y O F K → “gyofk” (not a valid word).
- G in 1, Y in 5: G _ O _ Y → G F O K Y → “gfo ky” (invalid).
- G in 2, Y in 1: Y G O _ _ → Y G O F K → “y g o f k” (invalid).
- G in 2, Y in 5: _ G O _ Y → F G O K Y → “fgoky” (invalid).
- G in 4, Y in 1: Y _ O G _ → Y F O G K → “y fogk” (invalid).
- G in 4, Y in 2: _ Y O G _ → F Y O G K → “f y ogk” (invalid).
- G in 4, Y in 5: _ _ O G Y → F K O G Y → “fkog y” (invalid).
- G in 5, Y in 1: Y _ _ O G → Y F _ _ O G → “y f _ _ og” (invalid).

Let’s look for actual English words that fit _ _ O _ _ and contain G and Y with allowed letters.

Possible words:
- “phogy” – P, H, O, G, Y → all allowed, pattern _ _ O _ _ with O in 3, G in 4, Y in 5.
- “voghy” – V, O, G, H, Y → but O is in position 2, not 3.
- “kogoy” – K, O, G, O, Y → but O repeats and we don’t know if double O is allowed.
- “yoghy” – Y, O, G, H, Y → but Y repeats and O is in position 2.

“Phogy” seems valid:
- P, H, O, G, Y → all letters are allowed (P, H, G, Y are not forbidden; O is fixed in 3).
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _ → P H O G Y → O is in position 3, G in 4, Y in 5.
- This tests new letters P and H.

Let’s verify:
- P: not forbidden.
- H: not forbidden.
- O: fixed in 3.
- G: confirmed in word, not in 3 (it’s in 4).
- Y: confirmed in word, not in 4 (it’s in 5).

Current constraints:

1. Pattern: _ _ O _ _  (O locked in position 3)
2. Letters that are in the word (must appear somewhere):
   - G (not in position 3, not in position 4)
   - Y (must appear, and not in position 4)
3. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   A, R, S, E, C, L, U, T, M, N, D, B, I, P, H

Allowed letters (alphabet minus the forbidden set):
F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z
plus Y (which must appear once)

We have:
- O in position 3
- G must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (cannot be 3 or 4)
- Y must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (cannot be 3 or 4)

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3
- Contains both G and Y
- Uses only the allowed letters

Let’s list possible placements:

Case 1: G in position 1
   G _ O _ _
   Then Y must be in 2, 4, or 5.  But 4 is forbidden for Y (from guess 4), so Y in 2 or 5.
   - G Y O _ _  → need two more letters from {F, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z}
   - G _ O _ Y  → need one more letter from {F, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z}

Case 2: G in position 2
   _ G O _ _
   Then Y must be in 1, 4, or 5.  4 is forbidden for Y, so Y in 1 or 5.
   - Y G O _ _  → need two more letters from {F, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z}
   - _ G O _ Y  → need one more letter from {F, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z}

Case 3: G in position 5
   _ _ O _ G
   Then Y must be in 1 or 2 (cannot be 4 because G is in 5 and Y can’t be in 4 anyway)
   - Y _ O _ G  → need one more letter from {F, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z}
   - _ Y O _ G  → need one more letter from {F, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z}

We need to find actual English words that fit these patterns.

Let’s look at Case 1:
- G Y O _ _  → need two more letters.  Possible endings: GYOFK, GYOFJ, etc.  None are valid words.
- G _ O _ Y  → G F O K Y → “gfo ky” (invalid).  G J O K Y → “gjoky” (invalid).

Case 2:
- Y G O _ _  → Y G O F K → “ygofk” (invalid).
- _ G O _ Y  → F G O K Y → “fgoky” (invalid).

Case 3:
- Y _ O _ G  → Y F O K G → “yfokg” (invalid).
- _ Y O _ G  → F Y O K G → “fyokg” (invalid).

Let’s try other combinations.  Maybe:
- G in 1, Y in 5: G _ O _ Y → G F O K Y → “gfo ky” (invalid)
- G in 2, Y in 1: Y G O _ _ → “ygofk” (invalid)
- G in 5, Y in 1: Y _ O _ G → “yfokg” (invalid)

Wait, let’s think of real words that fit _ _ O _ _ with O in 3rd and contain G and Y.

Possible words:
- “joggy” – J, O, G, G, Y → but O is in 2, not 3.
- “vogey” – V, O, G, E, Y → but E is forbidden.
- “kogoy” – K, O, G, O, Y → O repeats and we don’t know if double O is allowed.
- “yoghy” – Y, O, G, H, Y → H is forbidden.
- “gogy” – too short.
- “jogy” – too short.

Actually, let’s list valid English words of the form _ _ O _ _ that contain both G and Y with allowed letters.

Looking at allowed letters: F, G, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z, Y

Possible words:
- “kogoy” – K, O, G, O, Y → but O repeats and we don’t know if double O is allowed.
- “joggy” – O is in 2, not 3.
- “vogey” – E is forbidden.
- “wogey” – W, O, G, E, Y → E is forbidden.
- “zoggy” – Z, O, G, G, Y → O is in 2, not 3.

Hmm, seems limited.  Let’s try:
- “kogy” – too short.
- “jogy” – too short.

Wait, let’s think of “kogoy” even though it has double O.  If O can appear twice, this might work.

But let’s try another approach: maybe G is in position 5 and Y in 2.

Pattern: _ Y O _ G

Need one letter for position 1 from {F, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z}

Possible words:
- F Y O K G → “fyokg” (invalid)
- J Y O K G → “jyokg” (invalid)
- K Y O K G → “kyokg” (invalid)
- V Y O K G → “vyokg” (invalid)

None are valid.

Let’s try G in position 2 and Y in 5: _ G O _ Y

Possible words:
- F G O K Y → “fgoky” (invalid)
- J G O K Y → “jgoky” (invalid)
- K G O K Y → “kgoky” (invalid)
- V G O K Y → “vgoky” (invalid)

Still invalid.

Let’s try G in 1, Y in 2: G Y O _ _

None are valid.

None are valid.

This is tricky.  Let’s consider that maybe the word is “kogoy” despite the double O.

But “kogoy” is not a standard English word.  Let’s think of other possibilities.

Wait, let’s try “kogoy” and see if it fits any dictionary.

Actually, let’s try “kogoy” as it seems closest.

But let’s double-check the constraints:
- O is in position 3 (✓)
- G must appear: in “kogoy” it is in position 2 (allowed)
- Y must appear: in “kogoy” it is in position 5 (allowed)
- All letters are allowed: K, O, G, O, Y → none are forbidden.

This seems to fit.

Therefore, the next guess is “kogoy”.
