### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these letters without repeating any to test multiple possibilities at once. Common strong starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", etc. 

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters, and no repeats. This will help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these letters without repeating any to test multiple possibilities at once. Common strong starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", etc. 

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters, and no repeats. This will help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

All five letters in “arose” (A, R, O, S, E) are now known to be absent from the secret word.  
That eliminates a large portion of the alphabet, so we should choose a word that uses completely different letters.  
The next most common letters not yet tested include T, N, L, I, C, U, D, P, M, etc.  
A balanced choice that uses five new, common letters is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L).  
This will help us quickly narrow down the remaining possibilities.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L  
- Letters that ARE in the word (but not yet in the correct spots): U

We still need three more letters. The remaining common letters are C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y.  
We should pick a word that contains U and three new letters from this remaining pool.  
A good candidate is “MUDGY” – it has U, plus M, D, G, Y, none of which have been ruled out yet.  
This will test five fresh letters and keep the word valid.

From the feedback so far:

1. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, N, T, I, L, D, G  
2. Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct positions:
   - M is in position 1
   - U is in position 2
   - Y is in position 5

So the pattern we have is: M U _ _ Y

We still need two more letters for positions 3 and 4.  
Available letters (common ones not yet ruled out): C, F, H, J, K, P, V, W, Z

Let’s pick a word that fits the pattern and uses two new letters.  
A good candidate is “MUKEY” – but K and E: E is already ruled out.  
Next option: “MUVHY” – not a common word.  
Better choice: “MUFFY” – but F and F are allowed, and F hasn’t been tested yet.  
However, we already have U in position 2, so “MUFFY” repeats U.  
Another option: “MUCKY” – C and K are both untested.  
“MUCKY” is a valid word and fits the pattern M U C K Y.

Let’s go with “MUCKY”.

3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

We need a single letter for position 3 that, together with position 4, forms a valid 5-letter word of the form M U ? ? Y.

Possible combinations:

<guess>muppy</guess>",muppy,"We now know:

- Fixed pattern: M U _ _ Y  
- Letters already ruled out for position 3: D, G, C, F, K, L, N, S, T, I, A, R, O, E

Remaining common letters that have not been tested for position 3: H, J, P, V, W, Z

We need a single letter for position 3 that, together with position 4, forms a valid 5-letter word of the form M U ? ? Y.

Possible combinations:
- M U H H Y (not a common word)
- M U P P Y (valid word)
- M U V V Y (not common)
- M U W W Y (not common)

Among these, ""MUPPY"" is the only common word left. It uses P for both positions 3 and 4, and P has not been ruled out yet.

Therefore, the next logical guess is ""MUPPY"".",Guess 6: muppy -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) U(✓) P(x) P(x) Y(✓),FAIL
