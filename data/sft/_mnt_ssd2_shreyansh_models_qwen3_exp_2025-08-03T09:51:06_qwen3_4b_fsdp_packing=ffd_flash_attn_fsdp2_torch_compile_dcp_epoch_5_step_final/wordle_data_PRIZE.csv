For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should cover these letters.

Popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""AROSE"" as it contains 4 of the most common vowels (A, O, E) and the common consonant S, plus R.

- PRIPE – P is allowed but ""PRIPE"" is rare
- PRIZE – Z is allowed but ""PRIZE"" doesn't fit the pattern (needs to be P R I _ E)

""PRIDE"" seems to be the most common and valid word here.

Current confirmed pattern: P R I _ E  
Letters ruled out: A, O, S, T, C, G, D  
Letters still allowed for the 4th position: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit P R I _ E:
- PRIME – M is allowed and common
- PRIKE – uncommon
- PRIPE – rare
- PRIZE – Z is allowed but the word would be PRIZ_E, not matching P R I _ E

""PRIME"" is the most logical and common word that fits all constraints.

We now know the pattern is P R I _ E and the fourth letter cannot be A, C, D, G, M, O, S, T.

Letters still allowed for the blank: B, F, H, J, K, L, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common 5-letter words that fit P R I _ E:
- PRIME – already tried, M ruled out
- PRIKE – archaic, unlikely
- PRIZE – fits the pattern and Z is allowed

""PRIZE"" is the only common word left that fits the pattern and hasn't been ruled out for the fourth letter.
