### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should cover several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E, which are all very common letters. This gives us a broad initial probe to see which letters might be in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.  
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.  
- O(x): O is not in the word.  
- S(x): S is not in the word.  
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, E (but not in positions 1, 2, or 5 respectively).  
- Does NOT contain O or S.  
- Has three unknown letters (since A, R, E are already confirmed).

To maximize information, we should introduce new common letters not yet tested. Good candidates are T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc. A word that uses A, R, E in different positions plus two new common letters is ideal. 

A strong choice is “RAISE”:
- R moves to position 1 (was in 2, so this is new).  
- A moves to position 2 (was in 1, so this is new).  
- I and S are new letters, but S was already ruled out (O and S are both marked x).  
Oops, S is ruled out, so RAISE is invalid.

Next try “REACT”:
- R in 1, E in 2, A in 3, C and T new.  
This fits all constraints and introduces new common letters C and T.

But let’s check: A(-) means A is in word but not in 1 → 3 is fine.  
R(-) means R is in word but not in 2 → 1 is fine.  
E(-) means E is in word but not in 5 → 2 is fine.  
O and S are ruled out.  
REACT introduces C and T, which are common and unused.
