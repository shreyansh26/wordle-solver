### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common consonants in 5-letter words include S, T, R, N, L, and common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. A good starting word should cover these letters without repeating any. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓).
- L is in the word but wrong place (-).
- A is in the word but wrong place (-).
- T and E are not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word starts with S, contains L and A somewhere after the first letter, and does NOT contain T or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep S in position 1.
2. Place L and A in new positions (not their original spots: L was position 2, A was position 3).
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested.

Good candidates: STRAW, SPANK, SCALD, SHALM, SKALD.

""SHALM"" uses:
- S in position 1 (confirmed).
- H (new letter).
- A in position 3 (originally position 3, but feedback says A is in word but wrong place, so position 3 was wrong; however, position 3 in SHALM is A which would conflict. So avoid that.)

""SCALD"" uses:

From the new feedback on SAUCY:
- S is still correct in position 1 (✓).
- A is now correct in position 2 (✓).
- U, C, Y are not in the word at all (x).

So the pattern so far is: S A _ _ _

Letters known to be in the word: S (pos 1), A (pos 2), L (somewhere), but not in positions 2 or 3 respectively.
Letters known NOT in the word: T, E, U, C, Y.

Remaining positions 3, 4, 5 must include L (since L was marked “in word but wrong place” in SLATE, and positions 2 and 3 are now taken by S and A).

We need to place L in either position 3, 4, or 5, but not 2 or 3 (since in SLATE, L was in position 2 and was marked “wrong place”). However, position 3 is still open.

Possible placements for L: positions 3, 4, or 5.

We also need two more letters that have not been tested yet and are common in 5-letter words. Common remaining letters: R, N, M, P, D, G, etc.

Let’s try to form words with S A _ _ _ and include L.

Possible words:
- S A L _ _: SALAD, SALTY, SALSA, SALSA (but T, U, C, Y are out), so SALAD is possible (but D hasn’t been tested).
- S A _ L _: SAMBA (B not tested), SANDY (D not tested), etc.
- S A _ _ L: SAMBA, SANDY, etc.

Let’s pick a word that places L in position 3 (since it was in position 2 before and now positions 2 and 3 are SA). This seems logical.

A good candidate is ""SALAD"":
- S A L A D
- L is in position 3 (new position).

This seems like a strong next guess to test L in position 3 and introduce D.

This combination gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓).
- L is in the word but wrong place (-).
- A is in the word but wrong place (-).
- T and E are not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word starts with S, contains L and A somewhere after the first letter, and does NOT contain T or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep S in position 1.
2. Place L and A in new positions (not their original spots: L was position 2, A was position 3).
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested.

Good candidates: STRAW, SPANK, SCALD, SHALM, SKALD.

""SHALM"" uses:
- S in position 1 (confirmed).
- H (new letter).
- A in position 3 (originally position 3, but feedback says A is in word but wrong place, so position 3 was wrong; however, position 3 in SHALM is A which would conflict. So avoid that.)

""SCALD"" uses:
- S in position 1.
- C (new letter).
- A in position 3 (again, same issue).

""STRAW"" uses:
- S in position 1.
- T is already ruled out (x in SLATE), so avoid.

""SPANK"" uses:
- S in position 1.
- P (new letter).
- A in position 3 (same issue).

""SHARK"" uses:
- S in position 1.
- H (new letter).
- A in position 3 (same issue).

""SKALD"" uses:
- S in position 1.
- K (new letter).
- A in position 3 (same issue).

""SHALL"" uses:
- S in position 1 and 5 (but A is missing).

""SCALY"" uses:
- S in position 1.
- C (new letter).
- A in position 3 (same issue).

""SAINT"" uses:
- S in position 1.
- A in position 2 (originally position 3, so this is new).
- I (new letter).
- N (new letter).
- T (ruled out).

""SAINT"" is invalid because T is ruled out.

""SAUCY"" uses:
- S in position 1.
- A in position 2 (new).
- U (new).
- C (new).
- Y (new).

This seems good because:
- Keeps S in position 1.
- Moves A to position 2 (originally position 3, now new).
- Introduces U, C, Y which are new letters.

Let's go with ""SAUCY"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SAUCY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) U(x) C(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on SAUCY:
- S is still correct in position 1 (✓).
- A is now correct in position 2 (✓).
- U, C, Y are not in the word at all (x).

So the pattern so far is: S A _ _ _

Letters known to be in the word: S (pos 1), A (pos 2), L (somewhere), but not in positions 2 or 3 respectively.
Letters known NOT in the word: T, E, U, C, Y.

Remaining positions 3, 4, 5 must include L (since L was marked “in word but wrong place” in SLATE, and positions 2 and 3 are now taken by S and A).

We need to place L in either position 3, 4, or 5, but not 2 or 3 (since in SLATE, L was in position 2 and was marked “wrong place”). However, position 3 is still open.

Possible placements for L: positions 3, 4, or 5.

We also need two more letters that have not been tested yet and are common in 5-letter words. Common remaining letters: R, N, M, P, D, G, etc.

Let’s try to form words with S A _ _ _ and include L.

Possible words:
- S A L _ _: SALAD, SALTY, SALSA, SALSA (but T, U, C, Y are out), so SALAD is possible (but D hasn’t been tested).
- S A _ L _: SAMBA (B not tested), SANDY (D not tested), etc.
- S A _ _ L: SAMBA, SANDY, etc.

Let’s pick a word that places L in position 3 (since it was in position 2 before and now positions 2 and 3 are SA). This seems logical.

A good candidate is ""SALAD"":
- S A L A D
- L is in position 3 (new position).
- A is already confirmed in position 2.
- D is a new letter to test.

This seems like a strong next guess to test L in position 3 and introduce D.

Current confirmed information:
- Word starts with S A L _ _
- A is in position 4 but is not in the correct spot (it was in position 3 in SALAD and marked “-”).
- D is not in the word.

So the pattern is: S A L _ _ and the 5th letter must be a consonant that has not been ruled out yet (T, E, U, C, Y, D are out). Remaining common consonants include R, N, M, P, G, etc.

The 4th position must be a letter that is not A (since A was in position 3 in SALAD and is now marked “-” for position 4). The 5th letter must be a consonant not yet tested.

Possible words:
- S A L E N (but E is out)
- S A L M O (O hasn’t been tested, but is this a valid word?)
- S A L M O is valid but O hasn’t been tested yet.
- S A L M O is a good candidate to test M and O.

However, let’s think of more common words:
- S A L M O
- S A L M O is valid.

Another option is S A L M O, but let me check if there are better common words:
- S A L V A (but A is already confirmed in position 2)
- S A L M O seems the best.

SALVO seems like a good next guess:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common consonants in 5-letter words include S, T, R, N, L, and common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. A good starting word should cover these letters without repeating any. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Current confirmed pattern: S A L _ _

Letters already ruled out: T, E, U, C, Y, D, V, O.

So positions 4 and 5 must be filled with letters that have not appeared yet and are not among the ruled-out set. Remaining common letters include R, N, M, P, G, H, K, etc.

From the feedback:
- In SALAD, the A in position 4 was marked “-” (in the word but wrong place). This tells us the word does NOT have an A in position 4, but we already know A is only in position 2 (from SAUCY feedback). So position 4 can’t be A anyway.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common consonants in 5-letter words include S, T, R, N, L, and common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. A good starting word should cover these letters without repeating any. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓).
- L is in the word but wrong place (-).
- A is in the word but wrong place (-).
- T and E are not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word starts with S, contains L and A somewhere after the first letter, and does NOT contain T or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep S in position 1.
2. Place L and A in new positions (not their original spots: L was position 2, A was position 3).
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested.

Good candidates: STRAW, SPANK, SCALD, SHALM, SKALD.

""SHALM"" uses:
- S in position 1 (confirmed).
- H (new letter).
- A in position 3 (originally position 3, but feedback says A is in word but wrong place, so position 3 was wrong; however, position 3 in SHALM is A which would conflict. So avoid that.)

""SCALD"" uses:
- S in position 1.
- C (new letter).
- A in position 3 (again, same issue).

""STRAW"" uses:
- S in position 1.
- T is already ruled out (x in SLATE), so avoid.

""SPANK"" uses:
- S in position 1.
- P (new letter).
- A in position 3 (same issue).

""SHARK"" uses:
- S in position 1.
- H (new letter).
- A in position 3 (same issue).

""SKALD"" uses:
- S in position 1.
- K (new letter).
- A in position 3 (same issue).

""SHALL"" uses:
- S in position 1 and 5 (but A is missing).

""SCALY"" uses:
- S in position 1.
- C (new letter).
- A in position 3 (same issue).

""SAINT"" uses:
- S in position 1.
- A in position 2 (originally position 3, so this is new).
- I (new letter).
- N (new letter).
- T (ruled out).

""SAINT"" is invalid because T is ruled out.

""SAUCY"" uses:
- S in position 1.
- A in position 2 (new).
- U (new).
- C (new).
- Y (new).

This seems good because:
- Keeps S in position 1.
- Moves A to position 2 (originally position 3, now new).
- Introduces U, C, Y which are new letters.

Let's go with ""SAUCY"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SAUCY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) U(x) C(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on SAUCY:
- S is still correct in position 1 (✓).
- A is now correct in position 2 (✓).
- U, C, Y are not in the word at all (x).

So the pattern so far is: S A _ _ _

Letters known to be in the word: S (pos 1), A (pos 2), L (somewhere), but not in positions 2 or 3 respectively.
Letters known NOT in the word: T, E, U, C, Y.

Remaining positions 3, 4, 5 must include L (since L was marked “in word but wrong place” in SLATE, and positions 2 and 3 are now taken by S and A).

We need to place L in either position 3, 4, or 5, but not 2 or 3 (since in SLATE, L was in position 2 and was marked “wrong place”). However, position 3 is still open.

Possible placements for L: positions 3, 4, or 5.

We also need two more letters that have not been tested yet and are common in 5-letter words. Common remaining letters: R, N, M, P, D, G, etc.

Let’s try to form words with S A _ _ _ and include L.

Possible words:
- S A L _ _: SALAD, SALTY, SALSA, SALSA (but T, U, C, Y are out), so SALAD is possible (but D hasn’t been tested).
- S A _ L _: SAMBA (B not tested), SANDY (D not tested), etc.
- S A _ _ L: SAMBA, SANDY, etc.

Let’s pick a word that places L in position 3 (since it was in position 2 before and now positions 2 and 3 are SA). This seems logical.

A good candidate is ""SALAD"":
- S A L A D
- L is in position 3 (new position).
- A is already confirmed in position 2.
- D is a new letter to test.

This seems like a strong next guess to test L in position 3 and introduce D.

Guess 3: SALAD -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) A(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current confirmed information:
- Word starts with S A L _ _
- A is in position 4 but is not in the correct spot (it was in position 3 in SALAD and marked “-”).
- D is not in the word.

So the pattern is: S A L _ _ and the 5th letter must be a consonant that has not been ruled out yet (T, E, U, C, Y, D are out). Remaining common consonants include R, N, M, P, G, etc.

The 4th position must be a letter that is not A (since A was in position 3 in SALAD and is now marked “-” for position 4). The 5th letter must be a consonant not yet tested.

Possible words:
- S A L E N (but E is out)
- S A L M O (O hasn’t been tested, but is this a valid word?)
- S A L M O is valid but O hasn’t been tested yet.
- S A L M O is a good candidate to test M and O.

However, let’s think of more common words:
- S A L M O
- S A L M O is valid.

Another option is S A L M O, but let me check if there are better common words:
- S A L V A (but A is already confirmed in position 2)
- S A L M O seems the best.

But let’s consider S A L M O is valid. Alternatively, S A L M O is the same as SALMO, which is a valid word.

Another candidate: S A L M O is valid.

Another candidate: S A L M O is valid.

Wait, let me think of more common words:
- S A L M O
- S A L M O is valid.

Actually, let me list possible 5-letter words starting with SAL and ending with consonants:
- SALSA (S is already in position 1, but S is already used)
- SALAD (already tried)
- SALTY (T is out)
- SALSA (S already used)
- SALVO (O hasn’t been tested, V hasn’t been tested)
- SALVO is a valid word.

SALVO seems like a good next guess:
- S A L V O
- Tests V and O, which haven’t been ruled out yet.
- L is in position 3 (confirmed correct)
- A is in position 2 (confirmed correct)
- S is in position 1 (confirmed correct)

This seems optimal to test two new letters in one guess.

Current confirmed information:
- The word starts with SAL (positions 1-3: S, A, L).
- Position 4 is NOT A (it was marked “-” in SALAD).
- Letters already ruled out: T, E, U, C, Y, D, V, O.

We need a 5-letter word of the form SAL _ _ where the 4th and 5th letters are not any of the ruled-out letters.  
Remaining common consonants that haven’t been tested yet: R, N, M, P, G, H, K, F, etc.

Possible valid words:
- SALMN (not a recognized word)
- SALNH (invalid)
- SALMP (invalid)
- SALMN (invalid)

- SALNK (invalid)
- SALNP (invalid)

Wait, let me list real 5-letter words starting with SAL:
- SALSA (but S is already in position 1)
- SALAD (already tried)
- SALTY (T is out)
- SALSA (S already used)
- SALVO (already tried)
- SALSA (S already used)
- SALMA (A is already in position 2)
- SALMA (A is already in position 2)
- SALMA (A is already in position 2)

Actually, the only remaining common letter combinations are:
- SAL + R + ? (SALRY? SALRA? SALRM? SALRN? SALRG? SALRH? SALRM? SALRN?)
- SAL + N + ? (SALNK? SALNP? SALNG? SALNH? SALNM?)
- SAL + M + ? (SALMP? SALMR? SALMN? SALMG?)
- SAL + P + ? (SALPR? SALPS? SALPH?)
- SAL + G + ? (SALGR? SALGH?)
- SAL + H + ? (SALHR? SALHM?)
- SAL + K + ? (SALKR?)
- SAL + F + ? (SALFR?)
- SAL + ? + ? (SAL??)

Real words:
- SALSA (S already in position 1)
- SALAD (already tried)
- SALTY (T is out)
- SALSA (S already used)
- SALVO (already tried)
- SALSA (S already used)
- SALMA (A is already in position 2)
- SALMA (A is already in position 2)
- SALMA (A is already in position 2)

Upon reflection, the only remaining valid word that fits all constraints is SALMA, but A is already in position 2, so this doesn’t fit. I realize I must have missed a word.

Let me systematically list valid 5-letter words starting with SAL:
1. SALSA
2. SALAD
3. SALTY
4. SALSA
5. SALVO
6. SALSA
7. SALMA
8. SALMA
9. SALMA

All of these either reuse letters already ruled out or repeat confirmed letters in invalid positions. This suggests I need to re-examine the constraints.

Wait, position 4 cannot be A, but it can be any other letter not in the ruled-out set. The only remaining common letters are R, N, M, P, G, H, K, F.

Valid words:
- SAL + R + ? → SALRY (invalid), SALRA (invalid), SALRM (invalid), SALRN (invalid), SALRG (invalid), SALRH (invalid), SALRM (invalid), SALRN (invalid)
- SAL + N + ? → SALNK (invalid), SALNP (invalid), SALNG (invalid), SALNH (invalid), SALNM (invalid)
- SAL + M + ? → SALMP (invalid), SALMR (invalid), SALMN (invalid), SALMG (invalid)
- SAL + P + ? → SALPR (invalid), SALPS (invalid), SALPH (invalid)
- SAL + G + ? → SALGR (invalid), SALGH (invalid)
- SAL + H + ? → SALHR (invalid), SALHM (invalid)
- SAL + K + ? → SALKR (invalid)
- SAL + F + ? → SALFR (invalid)

None of these form valid English words. This implies I must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Rechecking the feedback:
- Guess 3: SALAD → S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) A(-) D(x)
  - Position 4 A is marked “-”, meaning A is in the word but not in position 4. However, A is already confirmed in position 2, so this is consistent.
- Guess 4: SALVO → S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) V(x) O(x)
  - Letters V and O are ruled out.

Thus, the word is SAL _ _ with:
- Position 4: not A, V, O, D, T, E, U, C, Y
- Position 5: not any of the ruled-out letters

Remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, R, S, W, X, Z

Valid words:
- SAL + B + ? → SALBP (invalid), SALBS (invalid)
- SAL + F + ? → SALFR (invalid), SALFS (invalid)
- SAL + G + ? → SALGR (invalid), SALGH (invalid)
- SAL + H + ? → SALHR (invalid), SALHM (invalid)
- SAL + K + ? → SALKR (invalid)
- SAL + M + ? → SALMP (invalid), SALMR (invalid), SALMN (invalid)
- SAL + N + ? → SALNK (invalid), SALNP (invalid), SALNG (invalid)
- SAL + P + ? → SALPR (invalid), SALPS (invalid), SALPH (invalid)
- SAL + R + ? → SALRY (invalid), SALRA (invalid), SALRM (invalid), SALRN (invalid), SALRG (invalid), SALRH (invalid)

Upon closer inspection, the only valid English word that fits is SALSA, but it repeats S in position 5, which is allowed since S is already confirmed in position 1. However, SALSA has S in position 5, which hasn’t been ruled out.

Let’s verify:
- SALSA: S A L S A
  - Positions 1-3: S A L (confirmed correct)
  - Position 4: S (not ruled out)
  - Position 5: A (confirmed in position 2, but position 5 is new)

This seems valid. However, the feedback for SALAD showed A in position 3 was “-”, meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. Since A is confirmed in position 2, this is consistent.

Thus, SALSA is a valid next guess.
