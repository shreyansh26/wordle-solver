For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify vowels and consonants efficiently. A good starting word often includes multiple vowels and common consonants. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This will help me quickly determine which vowels are present and their positions, as well as test the R and S letters. Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, T, A, E. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good vowel spread and common letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be first).
- R, O, S are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be fifth).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, O, S.
- Contains A (not in position 1) and E (not in position 5).

We need a 5-letter word with A and E, avoiding R, O, S.  
Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A word like “TEA” is too short, but “TEACH” has 5 letters and uses T, E, A, C, H.  
However, we need to avoid R, O, S and keep A and E.  
Another candidate: “EATEN” – but it repeats E twice and may not give new info.  
Better to test new consonants.  
“TALON” uses T, A, L, O, N – but O is already ruled out.  
“TALKE” – invalid (not a common word).  
“ELATE” – uses E, L, A, T, E – repeats E.  
“TREAD” – ruled out because it contains R and S.  
“TAPED” – uses T, A, P, E, D. This avoids R, O, S and tests new consonants P and D.  
“TAPED” is a valid 5-letter word.

A good starting word often includes multiple vowels and common consonants. ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This will help me quickly determine which vowels are present and their positions, as well as test the R and S letters. Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, T, A, E.

From the new feedback on CABLE:
- C is not in the word (x).
- A is still correct in position 2 (✓).
- B is in the word and in the correct third position (✓).
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So far we know:
- Word structure: _ A B _ _
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, T, P, D, C
- Letters confirmed: A (position 2), B (position 3)
- Letters that must appear somewhere else: L and E (since they were marked “in word but wrong position” in CABLE)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has the pattern _ A B _ _
2. Contains both L and E somewhere (but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively, because in CABLE L was in position 4 and E in position 5, and both were marked “wrong position”).
3. Does not contain any of the ruled-out letters (R, O, S, T, P, D, C).

Possible positions for L and E:
- L could be in position 1, 4, or 5 (but 4 was already tried and marked wrong, so 1 or 5).
- E could be in position 1, 3, or 4 (but 3 is B, so 1 or 4).

But since the word is _ A B _ _, positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are:
1: ?
2: A
3: B
4: ?
5: ?

We need to place L and E in positions 1, 4, or 5, but ensuring they are not in the same positions as in CABLE (L not in 4, E not in 5).

Possible combinations:
- L in 1, E in 4 → L A B E _
- L in 1, E in 5 → L A B _ E
- L in 5, E in 4 → _ A B E L
- L in 5, E in 1 → E A B _ L

Now we need to check which of these patterns form valid 5-letter words with the remaining letters (not including R, O, S, T, P, D, C).

Let’s consider each pattern:

1. L A B E _ → LABE_ : Need a valid letter for position 5. Possible letters left (not ruled out): B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. LABEL is a word (but L is already in 1, and we need to check if L is allowed in 5; it was marked “in word but wrong position” in CABLE, so it can be in 5). LABEL is valid.
2. L A B _ E → LAB_E : Need a letter for position 4. Possible: LABFE? No, must be valid. LABBE? Not valid. LABGE? Not valid. LABKE? Not valid. LABME? Not valid. LABNE? Not valid. LABPE? P is ruled out. LABQE? Not valid. LABVE? Not valid. LABWE? Not valid. LABYE? Not valid. LABZE? Not valid. So no valid word here.
3. _ A B E L → ?ABEL: Need a letter for position 1. Possible: F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. FABLE is a word (but B is already in 3, so FABLE has F A B L E). Wait, FABLE is F A B L E, which fits _ A B E L with F in 1. But in CABLE, L was in position 4 and marked wrong position, so in FABLE L is in position 4 again, which would be marked wrong position again. However, we know L must be in the word, so FABLE would have L in 4, which conflicts with CABLE feedback (L was in 4 and marked wrong position). Therefore FABLE is invalid because L would still be in 4.
4. E A B _ L → EA_B_L: Need a letter for position 4. Possible: E A B ? L. EA?BL: EABEL? Not valid. EABEL is not a word. EABIL? Not valid. So no valid word here.

Thus, the only valid word that fits all constraints is LABEL (L A B E L), which places L in position 1 and E in position 4. This satisfies:
- L is in the word but not in position 4 (now in 1).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (now in 4).
- No ruled-out letters are used.
- The structure _ A B _ _ is maintained.

Therefore, the next guess is LABEL.
