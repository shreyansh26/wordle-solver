### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use some of these. 

Looking at combinations, ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can quickly reveal which of these letters are present in the secret word. This will give us valuable information to narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The secret word has the fixed pattern: A _ O _ E  
   (A in position 1, O in position 3, E in position 5).

2. Letters that have been ruled out entirely: R, S, L, N.

That leaves us to choose the 2nd and 4th letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding A, O, E, R, S, L, N).  
Good remaining consonants: T, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, K, F, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (but we already have A and O and E, so no help there).

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits A _ O _ E.  
Let’s list possibilities:

- A C O D E → uses C and D (both still allowed)  
- A G O N E → uses G and N (but N is already ruled out)  
- A P O K E → uses P and K  
- A M O R E → uses M and R (R is ruled out)  
- A T O N E → uses T and N (N ruled out)  
- A P O D E → uses P and D  

Among these, “ACODE” and “APOKE” are less common; “AGONE” is invalid (N ruled out).  
The most common valid word left is “ACODE” (though “ACORN” is invalid because R is out).  
Actually, let me double-check: “ACORN” is invalid because R is out.

Next: “ACODE” is valid but uncommon.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The fixed pattern: A B O _ E  
   (A in 1, B in 2, O in 3, E in 5).

2. Letters ruled out entirely: R, S, L, N, D.

We still need to determine the 4th letter.  
Available letters (excluding A, B, O, E, and the ruled-out set R,S,L,N,D):  
C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits A B O _ E.  
Possible candidates:

- A B O K E → ABOKE (not a valid word)  
- A B O M E → ABOUME (not valid)  
- A B O F E → ABOFE (not valid)  
- A B O G E → ABOGE (not valid)  
- A B O H E → ABOHE (not valid)  
- A B O I E → ABOIE (not valid)  
- A B O P E → ABOPE (not valid)  
- A B O T E → ABO TE (not valid)  
- A B O C E → ABOCE (not valid)  
- A B O M E → ABO ME (not valid)  

Wait, let me re-examine common words ending in “-O _ E”.  
The only common English word that fits A B O _ E is “ABOVE”.

Letters: A B O V E  
- A, B, O, E are already confirmed.  
- V has not been tested yet and is not in the ruled-out set.  

Therefore, “ABOVE” is the logical next guess.
