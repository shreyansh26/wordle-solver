### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help us eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants.

Looking at common letters in English, the most frequent are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess would use several of these. 

One popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help us eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants.

Looking at common letters in English, the most frequent are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess would use several of these. 

One popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From SLATE:
- S, L, T are absent.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

From CRANE:
- C, N are absent.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (reconfirmed).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (reconfirmed).

So far we know:
- Letters that are definitely in the word: A, E, R
- Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: S, L, T, C, N
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in position 3
  – E cannot be in position 5
  – R cannot be in position 2

We still need to test new letters and place A, E, R in allowable positions.

Good remaining common letters: I, O, U, D, M, P, Y, G, H, K, etc.

We want a word that:
- Contains A, E, R (in allowed positions)
- Avoids S, L, T, C, N
- Introduces new letters to maximize information

Let’s try “GRAPE”:
- G (new letter)
- R (must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5)
- A (must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)
- P (new letter)
- E (must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4)

This places:
- R in position 2 – but we know R cannot be in position 2, so GRAPE is invalid.

Next try “DRAPE” – same issue with R in position 2.

Try “RADIO”:
- R (position 1 – allowed)
- A (position 2 – allowed)
- D (new letter)
- I (new letter)
- O (new letter)
- E is missing – we must include E.

Try “RAISE” – but S is excluded.

Try “RAPID” – missing E.

Try “RADAR” – missing E.

Try “REACT” – C and T are excluded.

Try “REBAN” – N excluded.

Try “REBUT” – T excluded.

Try “REIGN” – N excluded.

Try “REGAL” – L excluded.

Try “REBID” – missing A or E.

Try “REBEE” – double E allowed, but we need to test new letters.

Wait, let’s systematically place A, E, R with new letters.

We need:
- A not in 3
- E not in 5
- R not in 2

Let’s try “MARGE”:
- M (new)
- A (position 2 – allowed)
- R (position 3 – allowed)
- G (new)
- E (position 5 – not allowed, E cannot be in 5)

Try “MARES” – S excluded.

Try “MARGE” invalid (E in 5).

Try “GARRE” – double R allowed, but E in 5 invalid.

Try “RAGED”:
- R (position 1 – allowed)
- A (position 2 – allowed)
- G (new)
- E (position 4 – allowed)
- D (new)

This satisfies all constraints:
- Contains R, A, E
- Avoids excluded letters
- Places A in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), R in 1 (allowed)

Let’s go with RAGED.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help us eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants.

Looking at common letters in English, the most frequent are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess would use several of these. 

One popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word.

- A(-) – A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So far we know:
1. The word contains A and E.
2. A is NOT in position 3.
3. E is NOT in position 5.
4. The word does NOT contain S, L, or T.

We now need a word that:
- Uses A and E (in positions other than 3 and 5 respectively).
- Avoids S, L, T.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good letters to test next: R, N, I, C, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

Let’s try “CRANE”:
- C (new letter)
- R (new letter)
- A (known to be in word, not in position 3)
- N (new letter)
- E (known to be in word, not in position 5)

This tests C, R, N while keeping A and E in positions 3 and 5 (but since we already know A isn’t in 3 and E isn’t in 5, this placement will give us new info).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help us eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Good starting words often include vowels and common consonants.

Looking at common letters in English, the most frequent are: E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess would use several of these. 

One popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So far we know:
1. The word contains A and E.
2. A is NOT in position 3.
3. E is NOT in position 5.
4. The word does NOT contain S, L, or T.

We now need a word that:
- Uses A and E (in positions other than 3 and 5 respectively).
- Avoids S, L, T.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good letters to test next: R, N, I, C, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

Let’s try “CRANE”:
- C (new letter)
- R (new letter)
- A (known to be in word, not in position 3)
- N (new letter)
- E (known to be in word, not in position 5)

This tests C, R, N while keeping A and E in positions 3 and 5 (but since we already know A isn’t in 3 and E isn’t in 5, this placement will give us new info).

<|im_end|>

Let’s consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From SLATE:
- S, L, T are absent.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

From CRANE:
- C, N are absent.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (reconfirmed).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (reconfirmed).

So far we know:
- Letters that are definitely in the word: A, E, R
- Letters that are definitely NOT in the word: S, L, T, C, N
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in position 3
  – E cannot be in position 5
  – R cannot be in position 2

We still need to test new letters and place A, E, R in allowable positions.

Good remaining common letters: I, O, U, D, M, P, Y, G, H, K, etc.

We want a word that:
- Contains A, E, R (in allowed positions)
- Avoids S, L, T, C, N
- Introduces new letters to maximize information

Let’s try “GRAPE”:
- G (new letter)
- R (must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5)
- A (must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)
- P (new letter)
- E (must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4)

This places:
- R in position 2 – but we know R cannot be in position 2, so GRAPE is invalid.

Next try “DRAPE” – same issue with R in position 2.

Try “RADIO”:
- R (position 1 – allowed)
- A (position 2 – allowed)
- D (new letter)
- I (new letter)
- O (new letter)
- E is missing – we must include E.

Try “RAISE” – but S is excluded.

Try “RAPID” – missing E.

Try “RADAR” – missing E.

Try “REACT” – C and T are excluded.

Try “REBAN” – N excluded.

Try “REBUT” – T excluded.

Try “REIGN” – N excluded.

Try “REGAL” – L excluded.

Try “REBID” – missing A or E.

Try “REBEE” – double E allowed, but we need to test new letters.

Wait, let’s systematically place A, E, R with new letters.

We need:
- A not in 3
- E not in 5
- R not in 2

Let’s try “MARGE”:
- M (new)
- A (position 2 – allowed)
- R (position 3 – allowed)
- G (new)
- E (position 5 – not allowed, E cannot be in 5)

Try “MARES” – S excluded.

Try “MARGE” invalid (E in 5).

Try “GARRE” – double R allowed, but E in 5 invalid.

Try “RAGED”:
- R (position 1 – allowed)
- A (position 2 – allowed)
- G (new)
- E (position 4 – allowed)
- D (new)

This satisfies all constraints:
- Contains R, A, E
- Avoids excluded letters
- Places A in 2 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed), R in 1 (allowed)

Let’s go with RAGED.

Step-by-step deduction:

1. Letters we know are in the word:
   - R (position 1 is correct)
   - A (must appear, but not in position 2 or 3)
   - E (must appear, but not in positions 4 or 5)

2. Letters we know are NOT in the word:
   S, L, T, C, N, G, D

3. Positions ruled out so far:
   - A ≠ 2, 3
   - E ≠ 4, 5
   - R ≠ 2 (confirmed by CRANE feedback)

4. Remaining possible positions:
   - A can be in 1, 4, or 5
   - E can be in 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4 or 5)

5. We need a word that:
   - Starts with R
   - Contains A and E in allowable positions
   - Uses only untested letters from the remaining alphabet
   - Avoids all excluded letters

6. Remaining common letters to test: B, F, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

7. Possible placements:
   - R _ _ _ _
   - A must go in 4 or 5 (since 1 is taken by R)
   - E must go in 2 or 3 (since 1 is taken by R)

8. Let’s try combinations:
   - R E _ A _  (A in 4, E in 2)
   - R _ E A _  (A in 4, E in 3)
   - R _ _ _ A  (A in 5, E in 2 or 3)

9. Testing R E _ A _ with new letters:
   - R E B A _  → need a 5th letter (not excluded)
   - R E M A Y  → all letters allowed
   - R E P A S  → S excluded
   - R E B A N  → N excluded

10. Testing R _ E A _ with new letters:
    - R I E A M  → all letters allowed
    - R O E A P  → all letters allowed
    - R U E A Y  → all letters allowed

11. Testing R _ _ _ A with new letters:
    - R I S T A  → S, T excluded
    - R E D G A  → D, G excluded
    - R O B A A  → double A allowed, but need to test new letters

12. Best candidate: R E B A M
    - R (correct position)
    - E (position 2 – allowed)
    - B (new letter)
    - A (position 4 – allowed)
    - M (new letter)

This tests two new letters (B, M) while respecting all constraints.

The feedback “Model answer is not five letters” is a system message, not actual feedback on the guess.  
I’ll treat it as a reminder to use valid 5-letter words only.

Re-evaluate the constraints:
- R is fixed in position 1.
- A must appear, but not in positions 2 or 3.
- E must appear, but not in positions 4 or 5.
- Excluded letters: S, L, T, C, N, G, D.
- Remaining common letters to test: B, F, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

Possible placements:
- A can be in 4 or 5.
- E can be in 2 or 3.

Try:
R E _ A _  (E in 2, A in 4)
R _ E A _  (E in 3, A in 4)
R _ _ _ A  (A in 5, E in 2 or 3)

Let’s pick R E _ A _ and fill with new letters F and M:  
R E F A M – this is a valid 5-letter word and uses new letters F and M.

Check constraints:
- R in position 1 (✓)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- F (new)
- A in position 4 (allowed)
- M (new)

This satisfies all rules.
