### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use some of these letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This will give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is correct in the first position.
- O is correct in the third position.
- R, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the pattern so far is:
A _ O _ _

We need a 5-letter word that starts with A and has O in the third spot, and doesn’t contain R, S, or E.

Good letters to try next: common consonants and vowels we haven’t ruled out yet. Let’s try “AUDIO” but that has I and U, and we need to keep checking consonants. A better choice is “ADOPT” but T is untested. However, “ADOPT” has P which is untested. 

Another good candidate is “ALOUD” but that has U and D. 

Let me think of words that fit A _ O _ _:
- ALOOF
- ALOHA
- ALOD? (not a word)
- AMONG
- ANCHO
- APOCALYPSE (too long)
- AFOOT
- AGLOW
- ADORE (but E is ruled out)
- ADOPT (but P is untested)

“AMONG” is a good candidate: A M O N G. It fits the pattern A _ O _ _, uses new letters M, N, G, and avoids R, S, E. 

Let’s go with “among”.
