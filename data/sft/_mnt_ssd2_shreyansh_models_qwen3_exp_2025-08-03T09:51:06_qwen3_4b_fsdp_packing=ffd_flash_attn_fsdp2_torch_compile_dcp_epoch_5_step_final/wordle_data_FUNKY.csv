### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that uses common letters and helps eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination of letters will help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

So far we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L  
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: U and N

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both U and N.
2. Does NOT contain any of A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L.
3. Has U and N in different positions from their current ones (Guess 2 had U in position 1 and N in position 2).

Remaining common letters that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to place U and N somewhere else and fill the other three spots with allowed letters.  
Let’s try “MUNGY”:
- M, U, N, G, Y — none of A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L are used.  
- U is now in position 2 (was 1), N is now in position 3 (was 2).  
- This gives us new placement info for both required letters.

This seems like a good third guess.

From the feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L, M, G  
Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct positions:  
- U is in position 2  
- N is in position 3  
- Y is in position 5  

So the pattern is: _ U N _ Y

We need to fill positions 1 and 4 with letters that have NOT been ruled out.  
Allowed letters (not in the forbidden list): B, C, D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Let’s pick a word that fits _ U N _ Y and uses two of these allowed letters.  
A good candidate is “BUNNY” but N is already in position 3 and we can’t reuse it in position 4.  
Another option is “FUNNY” – but again N repeats in position 4.  
Let’s try “PUNCY” – but C and Y are allowed, and Y is already in position 5.  
Wait, Y is already fixed in position 5, so position 4 must be a new letter.

A valid word: “BUNNY” is invalid because N repeats.  
“DUNNY” – same issue.  
“FUNNY” – same.  
“PUNY” is 4 letters.  
“CUNY” – not a valid word.  
“VUNY” – not valid.  
“WUNY” – not valid.  
“HUNKY” – has K and H, but U is in position 2, N in 3, K in 4, Y in 5.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I should choose a word that uses common letters and helps eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination of letters will help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

All five letters in ""arose"" (A, R, O, S, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every word that contains any of those letters.  
To maximize information, I should pick a word with completely different, common letters that weren’t in the first guess.  
Good remaining common letters include: T, N, I, L, U, C, D, M, P, etc.  
A strong second guess using several of these is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L).  
It avoids the eliminated letters and tests five new, high-frequency letters that appear in many 5-letter words.

So far we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L  
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: U and N

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both U and N.
2. Does NOT contain any of A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L.
3. Has U and N in different positions from their current ones (Guess 2 had U in position 1 and N in position 2).

Remaining common letters that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to place U and N somewhere else and fill the other three spots with allowed letters.  
Let’s try “MUNGY”:
- M, U, N, G, Y — none of A, R, O, S, E, T, I, L are used.  
- U is now in position 2 (was 1), N is now in position 3 (was 2).  
- This gives us new placement info for both required letters.

This seems like a good third guess.
