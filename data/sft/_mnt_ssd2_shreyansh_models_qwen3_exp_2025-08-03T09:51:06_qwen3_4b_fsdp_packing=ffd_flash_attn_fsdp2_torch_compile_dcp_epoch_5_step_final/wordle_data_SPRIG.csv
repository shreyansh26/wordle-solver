### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""AUDIO."" These words cover frequently used vowels and consonants. 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes:
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give good coverage for the first guess.

- A is not in the word at all.
- I is in the word but not in position 3.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT present: A, E
- Letters present but misplaced: R (not 1st), I (not 3rd), S (not 4th)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R, I, S
- Does NOT contain A or E
- R is not in position 1
- I is not in position 3

- No A or E
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since it's not position 1)
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since it's not position 3)
- S is in position 4 (not allowed - feedback says S is not in position 4)

So ""FIRST"" is invalid because S would be in position 4.

- If R is in 5: S must be in 1 or 2: S _ _ _ I or _ S _ R I

Now, we need to find 5-letter words that fit these patterns, use only letters not ruled out (no A, E, T, U), and contain R, S, I with I at position 4.

Possible candidates:
- S _ R _ I: S C R I D? Not valid
- _ S R _ I: B S R _ I? Not valid
- S _ _ _ I: S P R I N? ""SPRIN"" isn't a word
- _ S _ R I: C S _ R I? ""CSR_I"" isn't a word

Wait, let's think systematically:
We need words with:
- I at position 4
- R somewhere (positions 3 or 5)
- S somewhere (positions 1, 2, or 3)
- No A, E, T, U
- All letters must be from remaining alphabet (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z)

Possible words:
- ""CRISP"" - but we know S is not in position 4 (it's 5 here) but CRISP has S in 4 which is invalid
- ""FRISK"" - S in 4 invalid
- ""DRIPS"" - S in 4 invalid
- ""GRIST"" - S in 4 invalid
- ""PRISM"" - S in 4 invalid
- ""CRISP"" - same issue
- ""DRIPS"" - same issue
- ""BRISK"" - S in 4 invalid
- ""FRISK"" - S in 4 invalid
- ""SCRIP"" - S in 1, C in 2, R in 3, I in 4, P in 5. This fits:
  - S in 1 (allowed)
  - C not ruled out
  - R in 3 (allowed)
  - I in 4 (correct)
  - P not ruled out
  - No A, E, T, U
  - Contains R, S, I

Let's verify SCRIP:
- Letters: S, C, R, I, P
- No A, E, T, U - correct
- I at 4 - correct
- R not in 1 or 2 (it's 3) - correct
- S not in 4 or 5 (it's 1) - correct

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""RAISE,"" or ""AUDIO."" These words cover frequently used vowels and consonants. 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes:
- R (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A is not in the word at all.
- I is in the word but not in position 3.
- S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT present: A, E
- Letters present but misplaced: R (not 1st), I (not 3rd), S (not 4th)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R, I, S
- Does NOT contain A or E
- R is not in position 1
- I is not in position 3
- S is not in position 4

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, etc.
Good remaining vowels: O, U

Let's try ""FIRST"":
- Contains F, I, R, S, T
- No A or E
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since it's not position 1)
- I is in position 2 (allowed, since it's not position 3)
- S is in position 4 (not allowed - feedback says S is not in position 4)

So ""FIRST"" is invalid because S would be in position 4.

Next try ""CRISP"":
- C, R, I, S, P
- No A or E
- R in position 2 (allowed)
- I in position 3 (invalid - feedback says I is not in position 3)
- S in position 4 (invalid - feedback says S is not in position 4)

Next try ""TRUST"":
- T, R, U, S, T
- No A or E
- R in position 2 (allowed)
- I is missing - we need I
- So this is invalid (lacks I)

Next try ""DRIPS"":
- D, R, I, P, S
- No A or E
- R in position 2 (allowed)
- I in position 3 (invalid - feedback says I is not in position 3)
- S in position 5 (allowed)
- But I is in position 3 which is invalid

Next try ""FRISK"":
- F, R, I, S, K
- No A or E
- R in position 2 (allowed)
- I in position 3 (invalid - feedback says I is not in position 3)
- S in position 4 (invalid - feedback says S is not in position 4)

Next try ""GRIST"":
- G, R, I, S, T
- No A or E
- R in position 2 (allowed)
- I in position 3 (invalid - feedback says I is not in position 3)
- S in position 4 (invalid - feedback says S is not in position 4)

Next try ""TRIUM"":
- T, R, I, U, M
- No A or E
- R in position 2 (allowed)
- I in position 3 (invalid - feedback says I is not in position 3)
- U is allowed
- S is missing - we need S

Next try ""CRUST"":
- C, R, U, S, T
- No A or E
- R in position 2 (allowed)
- I is missing
- S in position 4 (invalid - feedback says S is not in position 4)

Next try ""TRUIS"":
- T, R, U, I, S
- No A or E
- R in position 2 (allowed)
- I in position 4 (allowed)
- S in position 5 (allowed)
- U is allowed
- This seems valid

Check positions:
- R is not in position 1 (it's 2) - ok
- I is not in position 3 (it's 4) - ok
- S is not in position 4 (it's 5) - ok
- No A or E - ok
- All letters are in the word (R, I, S, U, T)

This looks like a valid next guess.
