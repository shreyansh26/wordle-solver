For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, T, N, S, L, etc.)
3. No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Popular strong starting words include: CRANE, SLATE, CRISP, RAISE, or AUDIO. Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly effective because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- Tests the letter positions for each of these letters

This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the secret word.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — so A is the 2nd letter.
- I, S, E are not in the word (x).

So the pattern so far is:
_ A _ _ _

Letters to avoid: I, S, E  
Letters to keep: R (somewhere else than position 1)

Common 5-letter words that fit _ A _ _ _ and contain R:
- BARON, CAROL, FAVOR, GLOAT, PAROL, RAVEN, RAPID, etc.

Let’s pick a word that introduces new common consonants and keeps R in a different spot. “BARON” uses B, R, N, O, but O hasn’t been tested yet. However, we already know E, S, I are out, but O is still possible.  
Another option is “CAROL” but L hasn’t been tested either.  
A better choice is “RAPID” because:
- It keeps R (now in position 3) and A in position 2.
- Introduces P, D, and L (new letters).

But “RAPID” may be less common. A more balanced word is “CRANE” but we already tried that.  
“CRANK” uses C, R, N, K — but C and K are less common.  
“FRANK” is similar.  
“GLOAT” uses G, L, O, T — but G and T are okay.  
“PAROL” is less common.  
“RAZOR” repeats R.  

The best seems to be “BARON” as it tests B, O, N.  
But let’s choose “CRANK” to test C, N, K.  
However, we need to maximize new letters.  
Let me pick “CAROL” to test C, R (new position), O, L.  

But wait, we know R is in the word but not in position 1.  
Let’s pick “CAROL” because it places R in position 3 and tests C, O, L.  

Actually, “CAROL” is valid and introduces C, O, L.  
But let me double-check: CAROL — C A R O L.  
Positions: 1-C, 2-A (fixed), 3-R, 4-O, 5-L.  
This fits the pattern _ A _ _ _ and places R in position 3, testing new letters C, O, L.  

So the next guess is CAROL.

Current known facts:
- Word pattern: _ A R _ _
- Letters confirmed: A (position 2), R (position 3)
- Letters ruled out: I, S, E, C, O, L

So we need a 5-letter word that looks like: X A R Y Z
with X, Y, Z chosen from the remaining unused letters (not I, S, E, C, O, L).

Common unused consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
and remaining vowels: U (since A is already used, and E, I, O are out)

Let’s list possible combinations:
- B A R G ? → BARGH, BARGM (invalid)
- B A R K → BARK? (only 4 letters)
- B A R G N → BARGN (invalid)
- D A R K → DARK? (only 4 letters)
- D A R L → DARL (invalid)
- F A R M → FARM? (only 4 letters)
- G A R B → GARB (invalid)
- H A R V → HARV (invalid)
- K A R T → KART (invalid)
- M A R V → MARV (invalid)
- N A R R → NARR (invalid)
- P A R T → PART (invalid)
- T A R D → TARD (invalid)
- T A R R → TARR (invalid)
- V A R V → VARV (invalid)
- W A R V → WARV (invalid)
- Y A R G → YARG (invalid)
- Z A R G → ZARG (invalid)

Wait, let me think of actual valid 5-letter words that fit X A R Y Z:
- B A R G E → BARGE (but E is out)
- B A R R I → BARRI (invalid)
- B A R R E → BARR E (invalid)
- B A R G A → BARGA (invalid)
- D A R L I → DARLI (invalid)
- D A R L A → DARLA (invalid)
- F A R L Y → FARLY (invalid)
- G A R B A → GARBA (invalid)
- G A R R E → GARR E (invalid)
- H A R D Y → HARDY (but Y is allowed, H is allowed, D is allowed)
- J A R D Y → JARDY (invalid)
- K A R L S → KARLS (invalid)
- M A R V I → MARVI (invalid)
- N A R R O → NARRO (invalid)
- N A R R Y → NARRY (invalid)
- P A R T Y → PARTY (but T and Y are allowed)
- Q A R K S → QARKS (invalid)
- T A R D I → TAR DI (invalid)
- T A R R I → TARRI (invalid)
- V A R G O → VARGO (invalid)
- W A R D O → WARD O (invalid)
- W A R N E → WARNE (invalid)
- Y A R G A → YARGA (invalid)
- Z A R D O → ZARDO (invalid)

Valid words that fit:
- HARDY (H, A, R, D, Y) – but we need to check if all letters are allowed. H, D, Y are not yet ruled out. This seems valid.
- PARTY (P, A, R, T, Y) – P, T, Y are not ruled out. This is valid.
- BARGE – but E is ruled out.
- FARMY – not a word.
- GARDY – not a word.
- JARDY – not a word.
- KARMA – but M is allowed, A is already used, but KARMA has M and A in positions 4 and 5, but position 3 is R, so KARMA is K A R M A – this fits! A is in position 2, R in 3, M and A are allowed (A is already used in position 2, but position 5 can be A if the word is KARMA). However, A is already confirmed in position 2, and we don’t know if A appears elsewhere. But KARMA has A in position 5, which might be possible.

But let me check PARTY first:
PARTY – P A R T Y
- P: not ruled out
- A: confirmed in position 2
- R: confirmed in position 3
- T: not ruled out
- Y: not ruled out
This seems like a good next guess as it tests P, T, Y.

Another option is HARDY:
HARDY – H A R D Y
- H: not ruled out
- A: confirmed in position 2
- R: confirmed in position 3
- D: not ruled out
- Y: not ruled out
This also seems good.

Between PARTY and HARDY, PARTY introduces P and T which are common letters, while HARDY introduces H and D. I’ll go with PARTY as it tests more common letters.

Based on the feedback:
- Pattern: _ A R _ _

- W A R D O → WARD O (invalid)
- W A R N E → WARNE (invalid)
- Y A R G A → YARGA (invalid)
- Z A R D O → ZARDO (invalid)

Valid words that fit:
- HARDY (H, A, R, D, Y) – but we need to check if all letters are allowed. H, D, Y are not yet ruled out. This seems valid.
- PARTY (P, A, R, T, Y) – P, T, Y are not ruled out. This is valid.
- BARGE – but E is ruled out.
- FARMY – not a word.
- GARDY – not a word.
- JARDY – not a word.
- KARMA – but M is allowed, A is already used, but KARMA has M and A in positions 4 and 5, but position 3 is R, so KARMA is K A R M A – this fits! A is in position 2, R in 3, M and A are allowed (A is already used in position 2, but position 5 can be A if the word is KARMA). However, A is already confirmed in position 2, and we don’t know if A appears elsewhere. But KARMA has A in position 5, which might be possible.

But let me check PARTY first:
PARTY – P A R T Y
- P: not ruled out
- A: confirmed in position 2
- R: confirmed in position 3
- T: not ruled out
- Y: not ruled out
This seems like a good next guess as it tests P, T, Y.

Another option is HARDY:
HARDY – H A R D Y
- H: not ruled out
- A: confirmed in position 2
- R: confirmed in position 3
- D: not ruled out
- Y: not ruled out
This also seems good.

Between PARTY and HARDY, PARTY introduces P and T which are common letters, while HARDY introduces H and D. I’ll go with PARTY as it tests more common letters.Based on the feedback:
- Pattern: _ A R _ _
- Letters confirmed: A (position 2), R (position 3)
- Letters ruled out: I, S, E, C, O, L

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — so A is the 2nd letter.
- I, S, E are not in the word (x).

So the pattern so far is:
_ A _ _ _

Letters to avoid: I, S, E  
Letters to keep: R (somewhere else than position 1)

Common 5-letter words that fit _ A _ _ _ and contain R:
- BARON, CAROL, FAVOR, GLOAT, PAROL, RAVEN, RAPID, etc.

Let’s pick a word that introduces new common consonants and keeps R in a different spot. “BARON” uses B, R, N, O, but O hasn’t been tested yet. However, we already know E, S, I are out, but O is still possible.  
Another option is “CAROL” but L hasn’t been tested either.  
A better choice is “RAPID” because:
- It keeps R (now in position 3) and A in position 2.
- Introduces P, D, and L (new letters).

But “RAPID” may be less common. A more balanced word is “CRANE” but we already tried that.  
“CRANK” uses C, R, N, K — but C and K are less common.  
“FRANK” is similar.  
“GLOAT” uses G, L, O, T — but G and T are okay.  
“PAROL” is less common.  
“RAZOR” repeats R.  

The best seems to be “BARON” as it tests B, O, N.  
But let’s choose “CRANK” to test C, N, K.  
However, we need to maximize new letters.  
Let me pick “CAROL” to test C, R (new position), O, L.  

But wait, we know R is in the word but not in position 1.  
Let’s pick “CAROL” because it places R in position 3 and tests C, O, L.  

Actually, “CAROL” is valid and introduces C, O, L.  
But let me double-check: CAROL — C A R O L.  
Positions: 1-C, 2-A (fixed), 3-R, 4-O, 5-L.  
This fits the pattern _ A _ _ _ and places R in position 3, testing new letters C, O, L.  

So the next guess is CAROL.

Current known facts:
- Word pattern: _ A R _ _
- Letters confirmed: A (position 2), R (position 3)
- Letters ruled out: I, S, E, C, O, L

with X, Y, Z chosen from the remaining unused letters (not I, S, E, C, O, L).

Common unused consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common 5-letter words that fit _ A _ _ _ and contain R:
- BARON, CAROL, FAVOR, GLOAT, PAROL, RAVEN, RAPID, etc.

Let’s pick a word that introduces new common consonants and keeps R in a different spot. “BARON” uses B, R, N, O, but O hasn’t been tested yet. However, we already know E, S, I are out, but O is still possible.  
Another option is “CAROL” but L hasn’t been tested either.  
A better choice is “RAPID” because:
- It keeps R (now in position 3) and A in position 2.
- Introduces P, D, and L (new letters).

But “RAPID” may be less common. A more balanced word is “CRANE” but we already tried that.  
“CRANK” uses C, R, N, K — but C and K are less common.  
“FRANK” is similar.  
“GLOAT” uses G, L, O, T — but G and T are okay.  
“PAROL” is less common.  
“RAZOR” repeats R.  

The best seems to be “BARON” as it tests B, O, N.  
But let’s choose “CRANK” to test C, N, K.  
However, we need to maximize new letters.  
Let me pick “CAROL” to test C, R (new position), O, L.  

But wait, we know R is in the word but not in position 1.  
Let’s pick “CAROL” because it places R in position 3 and tests C, O, L.  

Actually, “CAROL” is valid and introduces C, O, L.  
But let me double-check: CAROL — C A R O L.  
Positions: 1-C, 2-A (fixed), 3-R, 4-O, 5-L.  
This fits the pattern _ A _ _ _ and places R in position 3, testing new letters C, O, L.  

So the next guess is CAROL.

Current known facts:
- Word pattern: _ A R _ _
- Letters confirmed: A (position 2), R (position 3)
- Letters ruled out: I, S, E, C, O, L

So we need a 5-letter word that looks like: X A R Y Z
with X, Y, Z chosen from the remaining unused letters (not I, S, E, C, O, L).

Common unused consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
and remaining vowels: U (since A is already used, and E, I, O are out)

Let’s list possible combinations:
- B A R G ? → BARGH, BARGM (invalid)
- B A R K → BARK? (only 4 letters)
- B A R G N → BARGN (invalid)
- D A R K → DARK? (only 4 letters)
- D A R L → DARL (invalid)
- F A R M → FARM? (only 4 letters)
- G A R B → GARB (invalid)
- H A R V → HARV (invalid)
- K A R T → KART (invalid)
- M A R V → MARV (invalid)
- N A R R → NARR (invalid)
- P A R T → PART (invalid)
- T A R D → TARD (invalid)
- T A R R → TARR (invalid)
- V A R V → VARV (invalid)
- W A R V → WARV (invalid)
- Y A R G → YARG (invalid)
- Z A R G → ZARG (invalid)

Wait, let me think of actual valid 5-letter words that fit X A R Y Z:
- B A R G E → BARGE (but E is out)
- B A R R I → BARRI (invalid)
- B A R R E → BARR E (invalid)
- B A R G A → BARGA (invalid)
- D A R L I → DARLI (invalid)
- D A R L A → DARLA (invalid)
- F A R L Y → FARLY (invalid)
- G A R B A → GARBA (invalid)
- G A R R E → GARR E (invalid)
- H A R D Y → HARDY (but Y is allowed, H is allowed, D is allowed)
- J A R D Y → JARDY (invalid)
- K A R L S → KARLS (invalid)
- M A R V I → MARVI (invalid)
- N A R R O → NARRO (invalid)
- N A R R Y → NARRY (invalid)
- P A R T Y → PARTY (but T and Y are allowed)
- Q A R K S → QARKS (invalid)
- T A R D I → TAR DI (invalid)
- T A R R I → TARRI (invalid)
- V A R G O → VARGO (invalid)
- W A R D O → WARD O (invalid)
- W A R N E → WARNE (invalid)
- Y A R G A → YARGA (invalid)
- Z A R D O → ZARDO (invalid)

Valid words that fit:
- HARDY (H, A, R, D, Y) – but we need to check if all letters are allowed. H, D, Y are not yet ruled out. This seems valid.
- PARTY (P, A, R, T, Y) – P, T, Y are not ruled out. This is valid.
- BARGE – but E is ruled out.
- FARMY – not a word.
- GARDY – not a word.
- JARDY – not a word.
- KARMA – but M is allowed, A is already used, but KARMA has M and A in positions 4 and 5, but position 3 is R, so KARMA is K A R M A – this fits! A is in position 2, R in 3, M and A are allowed (A is already used in position 2, but position 5 can be A if the word is KARMA). However, A is already confirmed in position 2, and we don’t know if A appears elsewhere. But KARMA has A in position 5, which might be possible.

But let me check PARTY first:
PARTY – P A R T Y
- P: not ruled out
- A: confirmed in position 2
- R: confirmed in position 3
- T: not ruled out
- Y: not ruled out
This seems like a good next guess as it tests P, T, Y.

Another option is HARDY:
HARDY – H A R D Y
- H: not ruled out
- A: confirmed in position 2
- R: confirmed in position 3
- D: not ruled out
- Y: not ruled out
This also seems good.

Between PARTY and HARDY, PARTY introduces P and T which are common letters, while HARDY introduces H and D. I’ll go with PARTY as it tests more common letters.Based on the feedback:
- Pattern: _ A R _ _
- Letters confirmed: A (position 2), R (position 3)
- Letters ruled out: I, S, E, C, O, L

A valid 5-letter word that fits and introduces new common letters is:

Letters ruled out so far: I, S, E, C, O, L, T
Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Z

Looking for 5-letter words that match P A R _ Y:
- P A R B Y – not a valid word
- P A R D Y – valid word (means ""like a party"")
- P A R F Y – not valid
