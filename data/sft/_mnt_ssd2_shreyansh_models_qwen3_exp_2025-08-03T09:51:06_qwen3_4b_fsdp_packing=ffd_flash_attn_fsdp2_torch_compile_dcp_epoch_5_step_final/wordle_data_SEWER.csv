### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. Common choices are words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", etc. 

Looking at these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This can help quickly identify which vowels are in the word and potentially their positions, as well as whether R or S are present. 

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but ""AROSE"" might give slightly better vowel coverage. After considering, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a balanced first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:

- Does NOT contain A or O
- R is not in position 2, S is not in position 4, E is not in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that uses R, S, E exactly once each (since they all got “-”), plus two other letters that are not A or O. Also, the positions of R, S, E must differ from their original positions (2, 4, 5 respectively).

Possible letters to add: consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc., or other vowels like I, U, Y.

Let’s try to construct a word that moves R, S, E to new positions and adds two new consonants.

One candidate: STERN
- S is now in position 1 (was 4) – OK
- T is new
- E is now in position 3 (was 5) – OK
- R is now in position 4 (was 2) – OK

So far we know:
- Word starts with S (position 1)
- Must contain R, E, S (S already placed at 1)
- Cannot contain A, O, T, N
- E must not be in position 3, R must not be in position 2

We need two more letters (positions 2,3,4,5) that are not A, O, T, N. Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also need to place E and R in the remaining four positions (2,3,4,5) while respecting the constraints:
- E not in position 3
- R not in position 2

Let’s list possible positions for E and R:

Possible positions for E: 2,4,5
Possible positions for R: 1,3,4,5 (but 1 is S, so 3,4,5)

We need to choose two distinct positions for E and R from the remaining four slots.

Let’s try to construct a word:

Start with S _ _ _ _

We need to place E and R plus two new consonants.

Let’s try to pick common consonants. Let’s try R in position 3 (since it can’t be 2). Then E can be in 2,4, or 5.

Option 1: E in position 2, R in position 3
Word so far: S E R _ _
We need two more letters (positions 4,5) not in forbidden set. Let’s pick common letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, etc.

Try SERCH: but H is allowed, C is allowed. SERCH is a word (variant spelling of ""search"") but might be obscure.

Try SERUM: U is allowed, M is allowed. SERUM is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- S in position 1: ✓ (matches feedback)
- E not in position 3: ✓ (E is in 2)
- R not in position 2: ✓ (R is in 3)
- No A, O, T, N: ✓ (letters are S,E,R,U,M)
- SERUM is a valid 5-letter word.

This seems like a good next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. Common choices are words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", etc. 

Looking at these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This can help quickly identify which vowels are in the word and potentially their positions, as well as whether R or S are present. 

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but ""AROSE"" might give slightly better vowel coverage. After considering, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it's a balanced first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is NOT in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains R, S, E
- Does NOT contain A or O
- R is not in position 2, S is not in position 4, E is not in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that uses R, S, E exactly once each (since they all got “-”), plus two other letters that are not A or O. Also, the positions of R, S, E must differ from their original positions (2, 4, 5 respectively).

Possible letters to add: consonants like T, N, L, C, D, etc., or other vowels like I, U, Y.

Let’s try to construct a word that moves R, S, E to new positions and adds two new consonants.

One candidate: STERN
- S is now in position 1 (was 4) – OK
- T is new
- E is now in position 3 (was 5) – OK
- R is now in position 4 (was 2) – OK
- N is new

  - R in position 5: allowed (was in position 3 before, now moved)
  - Letters: S, E, V, E, R – no forbidden letters (A, O, T, N, U, M)
  - All letters are valid English letters
  - “SEVER” is a valid 5-letter word

This seems to be the correct next guess.

A good starting word should include frequently used vowels and consonants. Common choices are words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", etc. \n\nLooking at these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This can help quickly identify which vowels are in the word and potentially their positions, as well as whether R or S are present. \n\nAnother strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but ""AROSE"" might give slightly better vowel coverage.

From the feedback on SEVER:
- S(✓) E(✓) V(x) E(✓) R(✓)

This tells us:
1. S is correctly placed at position 1.
2. E is correctly placed at position 2.
3. V is not in the word (x).
4. E is correctly placed at position 4.
5. R is correctly placed at position 5.

So the word structure is now:
S E _ E R

We only need to determine the letter in position 3. The remaining letters must be chosen from the unused, allowed letters. From earlier, forbidden letters are: A, O, T, N, U, M, V. The remaining possible letters include B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit S E _ E R:
- SEWER: uses W (allowed)
- SEGER: not a common word
- SEPER: not a word
- SEFER: not a word
- SEGER: not a word
- SEDER: uses D (allowed)
- SEGER: not a word
- SEPER: not a word
- SEFER: not a word
- SEWER is the most common word fitting this pattern.

Checking SEWER:
- Letters: S, E, W, E, R
- No forbidden letters (A, O, T, N, U, M, V)
- It fits the confirmed positions S(1), E(2), E(4), R(5)
- W has not been tested yet, so it's a valid candidate.

Therefore, SEWER is the logical next guess.
