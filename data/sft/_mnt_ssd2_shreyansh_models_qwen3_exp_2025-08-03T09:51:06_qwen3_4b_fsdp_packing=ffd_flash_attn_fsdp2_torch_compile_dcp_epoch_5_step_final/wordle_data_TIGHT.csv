For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A common strategy is to use words with frequently appearing letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, N, L, etc. 

Looking at these letters, a good starting word might be something like ""AROSE"" which contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). This gives a good mix of letters that appear in many 5-letter words. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is another popular starting word that covers S, L, A, T, E. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes 3 vowels and 2 very common consonants, which should give me good information about the presence and positions of these letters in the secret word.

- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Possible candidates:
- “DITCH” – but C and H are still possible, D and T/I positions are okay. However, I is in 4th position here, which was ruled out.
- “MIGHT” – M, G, H are possible; I is 3rd, T is 5th. Neither I nor T is in a forbidden spot.
- “VITIC” – but C is possible, V is possible, but this seems less common.

Let's digest the new feedback:

1. AROSE → A, R, O, S, E are all absent.  
2. UNTIL → U, N, L are absent; T and I are present but in wrong positions.  
3. PITHY → P, Y are absent; I is correct in 2nd position; T is present but wrong position; H is correct in 4th position.

So far we know the word looks like:
- 1st letter: not A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L, P, Y  
- 2nd letter: I (fixed)  
- 3rd letter: not T (because T was marked ""-"" when it was in 3rd place in PITHY)  
- 4th letter: H (fixed)  
- 5th letter: not A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L, P, Y  

Remaining common letters (from alphabet minus the eliminated set):
B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word with pattern: ? I ? H ?

Possible consonants for 1st and 3rd positions from the remaining set.  
Let’s brainstorm:

- B I _ H _ : BIH? – no 5-letter words.  
- C I _ H _ : CIH? – no.  
- D I _ H _ : DIH? – no.  
- F I _ H _ : FIH? – no.  
- G I _ H _ : GIH? – no.  
- M I _ H _ : MIH? – no.  
- W I _ H _ : WIH? – no.  
- V I _ H _ : VIH? – no.  
- K I _ H _ : KIH? – no.  

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid English words.  
Let’s try swapping the fixed letters:

We have I in 2nd and H in 4th.  
Let’s look for words with that exact pattern: _ I _ H _.

Valid English 5-letter words ending in H are rare; most end in consonants.  
But we need _ I _ H _.

Searching mentally:

- M I N H ? – no.  
- B I G H ? – no.  
- C I V I L – no H.  
- F I G H T – no I in 2nd.  
- G I V E N – no H.  
- P I C H E – no, P and E eliminated.  
- V I G H N – no.  

Wait, let’s list every 5-letter word with pattern _ I _ H _:

- B I G H ? – no valid word.  
- C I V I L – no.  
- D I V E R – no.  
- F I G H T – no I in 2nd.  
- G I V E N – no.  
- J I G H T – no.  
- K I T H E – no.  
- M I N H ? – no.  
- P I T H Y – already used (PITHY).  
- S I T H ? – no.  
- T I M H ? – no.  
- V I G H T – no.  
- W I T H ? – no.  

This suggests I might have made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback carefully.

From PITHY:
- P(x) → P absent  
- I(✓) → I correct in 2nd position  
- T(-) → T is present but not in 3rd position  
- H(✓) → H correct in 4th position  
- Y(x) → Y absent  

So the pattern is: ? I ? H ?

Letters not yet eliminated (besides the fixed ones):
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Vowels left: none, since A, E, O, U, Y are all out, and I is fixed.

We need two consonants: one for 1st and one for 5th positions, from the remaining set, such that T appears somewhere else.

Possible words:
- B I T H ? – but 5th letter must be consonant, and T is already in 3rd.  
- C I T H ? – same issue.  
- D I T H ? – same.  
- F I T H ? – same.  
- G I T H ? – same.  
- K I T H ? – same.  
- M I T H ? – same.  
- V I T H ? – same.  

But we need a valid 5-letter word. The only common word fitting _ I _ H _ is ""MIGHT"", but that would require I in 2nd and T in 3rd, which conflicts with T being in wrong position in PITHY.

Wait, let me try ""MIGHT"":
- M I G H T  
- Letters: M, I, G, H, T  
- Check eliminations: M, G not yet eliminated.  
- I is in 2nd (correct), H is in 4th (correct), T is in 5th (new position).  

This fits all constraints:
- No A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L, P, Y.  
- I in 2nd ✓  
- H in 4th ✓  
- T in 5th (new position) ✓  

""MIGHT"" seems to be the only valid word left that fits the pattern.

</think>

Based on the feedback, the word must be _ I _ H _ with T appearing in a new position (not 3rd) and using only un-eliminated letters. The only valid 5-letter word fitting this is:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A common strategy is to use words with frequently appearing letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, N, L, etc. 

Looking at these letters, a good starting word might be something like ""AROSE"" which contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). This gives a good mix of letters that appear in many 5-letter words. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is another popular starting word that covers S, L, A, T, E. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes 3 vowels and 2 very common consonants, which should give me good information about the presence and positions of these letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means the word contains none of those letters.  
I now need a new set of common letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
Popular letters still in play: T, N, L, I, U, D, P, M, H, C, etc.  
A good second-guess word should use several of these.  
“UNTIL” uses U, N, T, I, L — all still possible.  
Another strong candidate is “PLUMB,” but “UNTIL” covers more common letters.  
I’ll go with “UNTIL.”

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → all letters (A, R, O, S, E) are NOT in the word.
2. UNTIL → U, N, L are NOT in the word; T and I are in the word but in the wrong positions.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L.
- DOES contain T and I, but not in the 3rd and 4th positions respectively.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Includes T and I somewhere (but T not 3rd, I not 4th).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Possible candidates:
- “DITCH” – but C and H are still possible, D and T/I positions are okay. However, I is in 4th position here, which was ruled out.
- “MIGHT” – M, G, H are possible; I is 3rd, T is 5th. Neither I nor T is in a forbidden spot.
- “VITIC” – but C is possible, V is possible, but this seems less common.
- “WHIT” – only 4 letters.
- “MITER” – but E is eliminated.
- “PITHY” – P, H, Y are possible; I is 2nd, T is 3rd. This seems valid.

Let’s choose “PITHY”:
- P, I, T, H, Y – all letters are still possible.
- I is in 2nd position (allowed), T is in 3rd (allowed).

So far we know the word looks like:
- 1st letter: not A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L, P, Y  
- 2nd letter: I (fixed)  
- 3rd letter: not T (because T was marked ""-"" when it was in 3rd place in PITHY)

- 5th letter: not A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L, P, Y  

Remaining common letters (from alphabet minus the eliminated set):
B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word with pattern: ? I ? H ?

Possible consonants for 1st and 3rd positions from the remaining set.  
Let’s brainstorm:

- B I _ H _ : BIH? – no 5-letter words.  
- C I _ H _ : CIH? – no.

- K I _ H _ : KIH? – no.  

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid English words.  
Let’s try swapping the fixed letters:

Let’s look for words with that exact pattern: _ I _ H _.

Valid English 5-letter words ending in H are rare; most end in consonants.  
But we need _ I _ H _.

Searching mentally:

- M I N H ? – no.  
- B I G H ? – no.  
- C I V I L – no H.  
- F I G H T – no I in 2nd.  
- G I V E N – no H.  
- P I C H E – no, P and E eliminated.

Wait, let’s list every 5-letter word with pattern _ I _ H _:

- B I G H ? – no valid word.

- S I T H ? – no.  
- T I M H ? – no.  
- V I G H T – no.  
- W I T H ? – no.  

This suggests I might have made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback carefully.

From PITHY:
- P(x) → P absent  
- I(✓) → I correct in 2nd position  
- T(-) → T is present but not in 3rd position  
- H(✓) → H correct in 4th position  
- Y(x) → Y absent  

So the pattern is: ? I ? H ?

Letters not yet eliminated (besides the fixed ones):
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Vowels left: none, since A, E, O, U, Y are all out, and I is fixed.

We need two consonants: one for 1st and one for 5th positions, from the remaining set, such that T appears somewhere else.

Possible words:
- B I T H ? – but 5th letter must be consonant, and T is already in 3rd.  
- C I T H ? – same issue.  
- D I T H ? – same.  
- F I T H ? – same.  
- G I T H ? – same.  
- K I T H ? – same.  
- M I T H ? – same.  
- V I T H ? – same.  

But we need a valid 5-letter word. The only common word fitting _ I _ H _ is ""MIGHT"", but that would require I in 2nd and T in 3rd, which conflicts with T being in wrong position in PITHY.

Wait, let me try ""MIGHT"":
- M I G H T  
- Letters: M, I, G, H, T  
- Check eliminations: M, G not yet eliminated.  
- I is in 2nd (correct), H is in 4th (correct), T is in 5th (new position).

- I in 2nd ✓  
- H in 4th ✓

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A common strategy is to use words with frequently appearing letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, N, L, etc. 

Looking at these letters, a good starting word might be something like ""AROSE"" which contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). This gives a good mix of letters that appear in many 5-letter words. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is another popular starting word that covers S, L, A, T, E. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes 3 vowels and 2 very common consonants, which should give me good information about the presence and positions of these letters in the secret word.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means the word contains none of those letters.  
I now need a new set of common letters that haven’t been ruled out.  
Popular letters still in play: T, N, L, I, U, D, P, M, H, C, etc.  
A good second-guess word should use several of these.  
“UNTIL” uses U, N, T, I, L — all still possible.  
Another strong candidate is “PLUMB,” but “UNTIL” covers more common letters.  
I’ll go with “UNTIL.”

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → all letters (A, R, O, S, E) are NOT in the word.
2. UNTIL → U, N, L are NOT in the word; T and I are in the word but in the wrong positions.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L.
- DOES contain T and I, but not in the 3rd and 4th positions respectively.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Includes T and I somewhere (but T not 3rd, I not 4th).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Possible candidates:
- “DITCH” – but C and H are still possible, D and T/I positions are okay. However, I is in 4th position here, which was ruled out.
- “MIGHT” – M, G, H are possible; I is 3rd, T is 5th. Neither I nor T is in a forbidden spot.
- “VITIC” – but C is possible, V is possible, but this seems less common.
- “WHIT” – only 4 letters.
- “MITER” – but E is eliminated.
- “PITHY” – P, H, Y are possible; I is 2nd, T is 3rd. This seems valid.

Let’s choose “PITHY”:
- P, I, T, H, Y – all letters are still possible.
- I is in 2nd position (allowed), T is in 3rd (allowed).

Let's digest the new feedback:

1. AROSE → A, R, O, S, E are all absent.  
2. UNTIL → U, N, L are absent; T and I are present but in wrong positions.  
3. PITHY → P, Y are absent; I is correct in 2nd position; T is present but wrong position; H is correct in 4th position.

So far we know the word looks like:
- 1st letter: not A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L, P, Y  
- 2nd letter: I (fixed)  
- 3rd letter: not T (because T was marked ""-"" when it was in 3rd place in PITHY)  
- 4th letter: H (fixed)  
- 5th letter: not A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L, P, Y  

Remaining common letters (from alphabet minus the eliminated set):
B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word with pattern: ? I ? H ?

Possible consonants for 1st and 3rd positions from the remaining set.  
Let’s brainstorm:

- B I _ H _ : BIH? – no 5-letter words.  
- C I _ H _ : CIH? – no.  
- D I _ H _ : DIH? – no.  
- F I _ H _ : FIH? – no.  
- G I _ H _ : GIH? – no.  
- M I _ H _ : MIH? – no.  
- W I _ H _ : WIH? – no.  
- V I _ H _ : VIH? – no.  
- K I _ H _ : KIH? – no.  

Hmm, none of these seem to form valid English words.  
Let’s try swapping the fixed letters:

We have I in 2nd and H in 4th.  
Let’s look for words with that exact pattern: _ I _ H _.

Valid English 5-letter words ending in H are rare; most end in consonants.  
But we need _ I _ H _.

Searching mentally:

- M I N H ? – no.  
- B I G H ? – no.  
- C I V I L – no H.  
- F I G H T – no I in 2nd.  
- G I V E N – no H.  
- P I C H E – no, P and E eliminated.  
- V I G H N – no.  

Wait, let’s list every 5-letter word with pattern _ I _ H _:

- B I G H ? – no valid word.  
- C I V I L – no.  
- D I V E R – no.  
- F I G H T – no I in 2nd.  
- G I V E N – no.  
- J I G H T – no.  
- K I T H E – no.  
- M I N H ? – no.  
- P I T H Y – already used (PITHY).  
- S I T H ? – no.  
- T I M H ? – no.  
- V I G H T – no.  
- W I T H ? – no.  

This suggests I might have made an error. Let me re-examine the feedback carefully.

From PITHY:
- P(x) → P absent  
- I(✓) → I correct in 2nd position  
- T(-) → T is present but not in 3rd position  
- H(✓) → H correct in 4th position  
- Y(x) → Y absent  

So the pattern is: ? I ? H ?

Letters not yet eliminated (besides the fixed ones):
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z  
Vowels left: none, since A, E, O, U, Y are all out, and I is fixed.

We need two consonants: one for 1st and one for 5th positions, from the remaining set, such that T appears somewhere else.

Possible words:
- B I T H ? – but 5th letter must be consonant, and T is already in 3rd.  
- C I T H ? – same issue.  
- D I T H ? – same.  
- F I T H ? – same.  
- G I T H ? – same.  
- K I T H ? – same.  
- M I T H ? – same.  
- V I T H ? – same.  

But we need a valid 5-letter word. The only common word fitting _ I _ H _ is ""MIGHT"", but that would require I in 2nd and T in 3rd, which conflicts with T being in wrong position in PITHY.

Wait, let me try ""MIGHT"":
- M I G H T  
- Letters: M, I, G, H, T  
- Check eliminations: M, G not yet eliminated.  
- I is in 2nd (correct), H is in 4th (correct), T is in 5th (new position).  

This fits all constraints:
- No A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L, P, Y.  
- I in 2nd ✓  
- H in 4th ✓  
- T in 5th (new position) ✓  

""MIGHT"" seems to be the only valid word left that fits the pattern.Based on the feedback, the word must be _ I _ H _ with T appearing in a new position (not 3rd) and using only un-eliminated letters. The only valid 5-letter word fitting this is:

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is another popular starting word that covers S, L, A, T, E. \n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes 3 vowels and 2 very common consonants, which should give me good information about the presence and positions of these letters in the secret word.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are NOT in the secret word.  \nThat means the word contains none of those letters.  \nI now need a new set of common letters that haven’t been ruled out.  \nPopular letters still in play: T, N, L, I, U, D, P, M, H, C, etc.  \nA good second-guess word should use several of these.  \n“UNTIL” uses U, N, T, I, L — all still possible.  \nAnother strong candidate is “PLUMB,” but “UNTIL” covers more common letters.  \nI’ll go with “UNTIL.”\n\n<guess>UNTIL</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(-) I(-) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two guesses we have:\n\n1.

From all previous feedback we now know:

- The word has the pattern: ? I G H T
- The first letter cannot be: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L, P, Y, M, F

Remaining possible first letters (from the alphabet excluding the above and duplicates): B, C, D, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter English word that starts with one of these letters and is followed by ""IGHT"".  
Checking each:

- BIGHT – valid (means the bend of a rope)  
- CIGHT – not valid  
- DIGHT – archaic past of “do”, not standard  
- JIGHT – not valid  
- KIGHT – archaic past of “knew”, not standard  
- QIGHT – not valid  
- VIGHT – not valid  
- WIGHT – valid (means a supernatural being or a man-like creature)  
- XIGHT – not valid

Between BIGHT and WIGHT, both are valid, but BIGHT is more common in modern usage.  
Therefore, the only remaining candidate is BIGHT.
