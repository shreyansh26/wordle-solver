### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains several common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. This will give me maximum information about the letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, S, E are **not** in the word at all (x).
- O is in the word but in the **wrong** position (currently at position 3).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O, but **not** in the 3rd position.
- Does **not** contain A, R, S, or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep the letter O (but not in position 3).
2. Avoid A, R, S, E entirely.
3. Introduce new common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (O is already confirmed).

A balanced word that uses O in a different position and introduces new common letters is ""POINT"":
- P, I, N, T are all new letters.
- O is moved to position 2 (was 3 before).

This should help narrow down possibilities effectively.

   – O is in the word but **not** in position 3.

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   – P, I, N, T are out.  
   – O is **confirmed** in position 2.

3. cloud → C(x) L(x) O(-) U(x) D(-)  
   – C, L, U are out.  
   – D is in the word but **not** in position 5.  
   – O is **again** marked “-”, which is consistent with it **not** being in position 3 (but we already knew it was in position 2).

So the word has the pattern:
- _ O _ _ _

and must contain the letter D somewhere other than position 5.

Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, L, U.

Remaining common letters that are still possible: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, V, W, Y, plus any others not yet tested.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Contains D somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 4).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

A quick scan of common English words that fit _ O _ _ _ and contain D:

- D O _ _ _  → “dol” is too short, “dolly” is 5 letters but has L (already out).  
- _ O D _ _  → “mold” is 4 letters, “moldy” is 5 but has L.  
- _ O _ D _  → “broad” is 5 letters, but A is out.  
- _ O _ _ D  → “bogod” isn’t a word; “godly” has L.  
- _ O _ D _  → “moldy” already ruled out.  
- _ O _ _ D  → “bogod” no, “godly” no, “joked” has K and E (E is out).  
- _ O _ _ D  → “wood” is 4 letters.  
- _ O _ _ D  → “hodad” isn’t a word.  
- _ O _ _ D  → “mogad” isn’t a word.  
- _ O _ _ D  → “bogod” no.  
- _ O _ _ D  → “joked” has K and E (E is out).  
- _ O _ _ D  → “wod” is too short.  
- _ O _ _ D  → “yod” is too short.  
- _ O _ _ D  → “d” is already used.  

Let me rethink: we need a valid 5-letter word with O in position 2 and D somewhere else, using only the still-allowed letters.

Try “broad” – but A is out.  
Try “moldy” – L is out.  
Try “gloved” – L, V, E are out.  
Try “joked” – K and E are out.  
Try “wowed” – W, E, D; E is out.  
Try “joked” – already ruled out.  
Try “mogad” – not a word.  
Try “moldy” – L is out.  
Try “godly” – L, Y are out.  
Try “bogod” – not a word.  
Try “dodgy” – D, G, Y; but Y is allowed, G is allowed, D is allowed, but we have D twice and G is new.  
“dodgy” is a valid 5-letter word: D O D G Y.  
Check letters: D, O, G, Y – none are ruled out.  
Check positions: O is in position 2 (✓), D is in positions 1 and 3 (so not in 5, which matches feedback).  
This seems valid.

Another candidate: “dodgy”.

Let’s go with that.

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
