### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it covers very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) which appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Let's go with SLATE as our first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains A, but NOT in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A (but not in position 3).
2. Excludes S, L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

From the two pieces of feedback we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word, but NOT in position 3.

2. MARCH → M(✓) A(✓) R(✓) C(x) H(x)  
   – M is in position 1 and correct.  
   – A is in position 2 and correct.  
   – R is in position 3 and correct.  
   – C and H are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: M A R _ _
- Letters still allowed: any letter except S, L, T, E, C, H.
- Letters already placed: M, A, R are fixed in positions 1, 2, 3.
- We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding S, L, T, E, C, H.

Common letters left: D, F, G, I, K, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s look for 5-letter words that start with “MAR” and use only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- MARDI (but D and I are allowed) – however, “MARDI” is not a common word.
- MARGA (G and A already used, but A is already in position 2)
- MARRY – uses Y which is allowed, but double R might be okay.
- MARCH – already tried, C and H are invalid.
- MARGO – uses G and O, both allowed.
- MARMY – uses M again (but M is already in position 1 and can’t repeat in position 4).
- MARMAL (too long)
- MARCH – already tried
- MARDEN – uses D and N, both allowed.

Let’s pick a common word: MARDI is obscure, MARGO is plausible, MARDEN is plausible.

MARDEN is a valid 5-letter word meaning a piece of land adjacent to a river or stream.

Check letters: M, A, R, D, E – but E is invalid (from SLATE feedback, E(x)), so MARDEN is invalid.

Next: MARGO – letters M, A, R, G, O – all allowed.

Another candidate: MARRY – letters M, A, R, R, Y – double R is allowed, Y is allowed.

Between MARGO and MARRY, MARRY is more common.

Let’s go with MARRY.

But wait, MARRY uses Y which is allowed, but double R is acceptable as long as R is already confirmed in position 3.

Actually, position 4 is the second R, which is fine.

So final choice: MARRY.

But let me double-check: M A R R Y – positions 1-5, letters are M, A, R, R, Y. R is already confirmed in position 3, so the second R in position 4 is a repeat letter which is allowed.

But we need to ensure we’re not repeating letters unnecessarily. A better choice might be MARGO.

MARGO: M, A, R, G, O – all allowed, no repeats except R is already placed once.

Yes, MARGO is valid.

Let’s go with MARGO.

</think>

Based on the feedback:
- The first three letters are M A R.
- The last two letters must be from the remaining alphabet (excluding S, L, T, E, C, H).

A valid 5-letter word fitting these constraints is MARGO.

Another candidate: MARRY – letters M, A, R, R, Y – double R is allowed, Y is allowed.

Between MARGO and MARRY, MARRY is more common.

Let’s go with MARRY.

But wait, MARRY uses Y which is allowed, but double R is acceptable as long as R is already confirmed in position 3.

Actually, position 4 is the second R, which is fine.

So final choice: MARRY.

But let me double-check: M A R R Y – positions 1-5, letters are M, A, R, R, Y. R is already confirmed in position 3, so the second R in position 4 is a repeat letter which is allowed.

But we need to ensure we’re not repeating letters unnecessarily. A better choice might be MARGO.

MARGO: M, A, R, G, O – all allowed, no repeats except R is already placed once.

Yes, MARGO is valid.

Let’s go with MARGO.Based on the feedback:
- The first three letters are M A R.
- The last two letters must be from the remaining alphabet (excluding S, L, T, E, C, H).

A valid 5-letter word fitting these constraints is MARGO.",Guess 3: MARGO -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) R(✓) G(x) O(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it covers very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) which appear in many 5-letter words. This should give us good information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Let's go with SLATE as our first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains A, but NOT in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A (but not in position 3).
2. Excludes S, L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good letters to try next: R, N, I, O, C, U, M, P, etc.

Possible candidates:
- CRANK (but has C, R, A, N, K - positions: A in 3rd is disallowed)
- BRICK (B, R, I, C, K - no A, so skip)
- CHAIR (C, H, A, I, R - A in 3rd is disallowed)
- MARCH (M, A, R, C, H - A in 2nd is allowed)
- PRAIR (P, R, A, I, R - A in 3rd is disallowed)
- PRANK (P, R, A, N, K - A in 3rd is disallowed)
- GRAIN (G, R, A, I, N - A in 3rd is disallowed)
- MURKY (no A)
- CHARM (C, H, A, R, M - A in 3rd is disallowed)
- PRANC (P, R, A, N, C - A in 3rd is disallowed)

Wait, let's think differently - A can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Good candidates:
- CHARM (A in 3rd - invalid)
- MARCH (A in 2nd - valid)
- PRANK (A in 3rd - invalid)
- CRANE (invalid - has E)
- CRANK (invalid - A in 3rd)
- CHAIN (no A)
- MURAL (no A)
- RANCH (A in 3rd - invalid)
- CANTO (no A)
- MANTA (A in 5th - valid)
- MANIA (A in 3rd - invalid)
- PANDA (A in 3rd - invalid)
- MANGO (A in 3rd - invalid)
- HUMID (no A)
- MURKY (no A)
- MURRA (A in 5th - valid)
- MURRA is 5 letters but has double R - valid
- MURRA is acceptable

Another candidate: MURRA - but double letters might not be optimal.

Better: MARCH - has A in 2nd, uses M, R, C, H - all new letters.

Let's choose MARCH as next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: MARCH -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) R(✓) C(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word, but NOT in position 3.

2. MARCH → M(✓) A(✓) R(✓) C(x) H(x)  
   – M is in position 1 and correct.  
   – A is in position 2 and correct.  
   – R is in position 3 and correct.  
   – C and H are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: M A R _ _
- Letters still allowed: any letter except S, L, T, E, C, H.
- Letters already placed: M, A, R are fixed in positions 1, 2, 3.
- We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, chosen from the remaining alphabet excluding S, L, T, E, C, H.

Common letters left: D, F, G, I, K, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s look for 5-letter words that start with “MAR” and use only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- MARDI (but D and I are allowed) – however, “MARDI” is not a common word.
- MARGA (G and A already used, but A is already in position 2)
- MARRY – uses Y which is allowed, but double R might be okay.
- MARCH – already tried, C and H are invalid.
- MARGO – uses G and O, both allowed.
- MARMY – uses M again (but M is already in position 1 and can’t repeat in position 4).
- MARMAL (too long)
- MARCH – already tried
- MARDEN – uses D and N, both allowed.

Let’s pick a common word: MARDI is obscure, MARGO is plausible, MARDEN is plausible.

MARDEN is a valid 5-letter word meaning a piece of land adjacent to a river or stream.

Check letters: M, A, R, D, E – but E is invalid (from SLATE feedback, E(x)), so MARDEN is invalid.

Next: MARGO – letters M, A, R, G, O – all allowed.

Another candidate: MARRY – letters M, A, R, R, Y – double R is allowed, Y is allowed.

Between MARGO and MARRY, MARRY is more common.

Let’s go with MARRY.

But wait, MARRY uses Y which is allowed, but double R is acceptable as long as R is already confirmed in position 3.

Actually, position 4 is the second R, which is fine.

So final choice: MARRY.

But let me double-check: M A R R Y – positions 1-5, letters are M, A, R, R, Y. R is already confirmed in position 3, so the second R in position 4 is a repeat letter which is allowed.

But we need to ensure we’re not repeating letters unnecessarily. A better choice might be MARGO.

MARGO: M, A, R, G, O – all allowed, no repeats except R is already placed once.

Yes, MARGO is valid.

Let’s go with MARGO.Based on the feedback:
- The first three letters are M A R.
- The last two letters must be from the remaining alphabet (excluding S, L, T, E, C, H).

A valid 5-letter word fitting these constraints is MARGO.
