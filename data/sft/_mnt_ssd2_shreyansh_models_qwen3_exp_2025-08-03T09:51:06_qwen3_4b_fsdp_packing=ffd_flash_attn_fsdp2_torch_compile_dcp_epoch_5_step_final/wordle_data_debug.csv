For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify potential letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequently used in English

This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O, S are **not** in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E somewhere, but NOT in position 5.
- Does **not** contain A, R, O, S.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes E (but not at the end)
2. Avoids A, R, O, S
3. Uses common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out, and E is confirmed)

A strong second guess should test new common letters while incorporating E.  
""UNTIE"" is a good candidate because:
- It places E in a new position (position 4)
- Uses U and I (other common vowels)
- Uses N and T (common consonants not yet tested)
- Avoids all letters already ruled out (A, R, O, S)

This will help narrow down remaining possibilities efficiently.

Current constraints:

Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, N, T, I, M, L  
Letters definitely IN the word (but positions unknown): E, U, D  

So the secret word must contain E, U, D and none of the letters above.

Remaining common letters that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E, U, D exactly once each  
- Does NOT contain any of A, R, O, S, N, T, I, M, L  
- Uses only the allowed letters

Possible structure: Since we have three required letters (E, U, D), we need two more distinct letters from the remaining pool.

Let’s try to pick two common consonants. Good candidates: B, C, F, G, H, P, V, W, Y.

A word that fits: “DUPED” – but P and second E are allowed, and it contains D, U, P, E, D. However, this has two D’s, and we don’t know if D appears twice. Also, we have no info about P yet.

Another candidate: “BUDDY” – but has two D’s and Y, and we don’t know about Y.

“CUBED” – uses C, U, B, E, D. All letters are allowed, and no duplicates. This seems good because:
- Contains E, U, D  
- All letters are from the allowed set  
- C and B are new letters to test positions for.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify potential letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- Two common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequently used in English

This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O, S are **not** in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E somewhere, but NOT in position 5.
- Does **not** contain A, R, O, S.

I now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes E (but not at the end)
2. Avoids A, R, O, S
3. Uses common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are out, and E is confirmed)

A strong second guess should test new common letters while incorporating E.  
""UNTIE"" is a good candidate because:
- It places E in a new position (position 4)
- Uses U and I (other common vowels)
- Uses N and T (common consonants not yet tested)
- Avoids all letters already ruled out (A, R, O, S)

This will help narrow down remaining possibilities efficiently.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, N, T, I  
Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions): E, U  

So the secret word must contain both E and U, and must avoid the seven letters already ruled out.  
Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E and U  
- Does not contain A, R, O, S, N, T, I  
- Places E and U in new positions (since both have been marked “-” so far)

A straightforward candidate that meets these constraints is “MULED”:
- It has E and U  
- All letters are from the allowed set  
- E is now in position 4, U in position 2 – both new positions  
- Uses common letters M, L, D that haven’t been tested yet.

This should give us more information about which of the still-untested letters are present.

From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, N, T, I, M, L, C  
Letters that ARE in the word:  
- U (in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, or 4)  
- B (in the word and in the correct position 3)  
- E (in the word, but not in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)  
- D (in the word, but not in positions 3, 4, or 5)  

So the word pattern so far is: _ _ B _ _  
We know it must contain U and D somewhere, and E must appear exactly once (since it’s only been marked “-” so far).  
But E cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5. The only remaining spot for E is position 3, but position 3 is already B.  
This is impossible, meaning our earlier interpretation must be wrong.  

Wait: the feedback for guess 4 (cubed) shows:  
C(x) U(-) B(✓) E(-) D(-)  

This means:  
- B is in position 3 (✓)  
- U is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-)  
- D is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)  

So the word has B in position 3, and must also contain U, E, D.  
Positions available: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but 3 is B).  
Constraints:  
- E cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (from earlier feedback).  
This is impossible because E must appear somewhere, but all positions are ruled out.  

This contradiction implies we mis-read the feedback.  
Re-examining the feedback for guess 4 (cubed):  
C(x) U(-) B(✓) E(-) D(-)  

The symbols apply to the letters in the guess order:  
- C(x) – not in word  
- U(-) – in word, wrong position (position 2)  
- B(✓) – correct position (position 3)  
- E(-) – in word, wrong position (position 4)  
- D(-) – in word, wrong position (position 5)  

So the word has:  
- B in position 3  
- U somewhere (but not position 2)  
- E somewhere (but not position 4)  
- D somewhere (but not position 5)  

The word must be 5 letters, with B in position 3.  
Possible positions for U: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but 3 is B) → 1, 4, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 3 is B) → 1, 2, 5 (but E cannot be in 5 because D must be in 5 or earlier, and D cannot be in 5)  
Wait, D cannot be in 5, so D must be in 1, 2, or 4.  
E cannot be in 4, so E must be in 1, 2, or 5.  
But 5 is possible for E only if D is in 1 or 2 or 4.  

Let’s list possible arrangements:

Pattern: _ _ B _ _  

We need to place U, E, D in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with constraints:  
- U not in 2  
- E not in 4  
- D not in 5  

Possible positions:  
- D can be in 1, 2, or 4  
- E can be in 1, 2, or 5  
- U can be in 1, 4, or 5  

We need to choose two more letters from the remaining allowed letters (since we have only 3 known letters: B, U, E, D).  

But the word is exactly 5 letters and must contain B, U, E, D. That’s four letters, so the fifth must be one of the remaining allowed letters.  

Allowed letters so far:  
Not ruled out: B, U, E, D, and any others not in {A, R, O, S, N, T, I, M, L, C}.  

Looking at the remaining common letters: F, G, H, J, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.  

We need a 5-letter word that contains B, U, E, D and one more letter from the allowed set, with B in position 3.  

Possible candidates:  
- DUBED – but has two E’s, and we don’t know if E repeats.  
- BUSED – but S is ruled out.  
- BUDGE – contains G, which is allowed. Let’s check:  
  - B in 3 (✓)  
  - U in 2 – but U cannot be in 2 (from cubed feedback)  
- BUDGE: U in 2 – invalid  
- BUDDY – has two D’s and Y  
- BUSED – S is invalid  
- BUDDY – Y is allowed, but two D’s  
- BUDDY: B U D D Y – positions: 1=B, 2=U (invalid), 3=D (but B must be in 3), so invalid  

Wait, we need B in position 3. So the pattern is: _ _ B _ _  

We have to place U, E, D in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with constraints:  
- U not in 2  
- E not in 4  
- D not in 5  

Possible combinations:  
Let’s list possible distributions:  

Case 1: D in 1  
Then positions left: 2, 4, 5 for U, E, and one more letter.  
But we need to place U, E, and one more letter. However, we already have B, U, E, D, so the fifth letter must be one of the remaining allowed letters.  

But the word must be exactly 5 letters and must contain B, U, E, D. That means it must be a permutation of B, U, E, D plus one more letter. However, we have only four known letters, so the fifth must be another allowed letter.  

But the word must be 5 letters, and we have four required letters (B, U, E, D) plus one more. This seems complex.  

Wait, the word must contain B, U, E, D, and one more letter from the remaining allowed set.  

With B fixed in position 3, we need to arrange U, E, D plus one more letter in positions 1, 2, 4, 5.  

Let’s try to find such a word.  

Possible candidates:  
- B U D E D – but two D’s  
- B U E D _ – but D must be placed  
This is getting messy.  

Let’s step back. The constraints are:  
- B is in position 3  
- U is in the word, not in position 2  
- E is in the word, not in position 4  
- D is in the word, not in position 5  

So the word has:  
Position 3: B  
Positions 1, 2, 4, 5 must contain U, E, D and one more letter (from remaining allowed).  

Let’s list possible placements:  

Option 1: D in 1  
Then positions 2, 4, 5 must contain U, E, and one more letter.  
But E cannot be in 4, so possible:  
- D _ B U E – but position 2 is blank, need to place U or other.  
Actually, positions are: 1=D, 3=B, and need to place U, E in 2,4,5 with D already in 1.  

Wait, the word is 5 letters: _ _ B _ _  

We have letters: D, U, E, B, and one more.  

Let’s try to find a valid permutation.  

One valid word: B U D E D – but two D’s  
Another: D U B E _ – but need to place the fifth letter.  

This is tricky. Let’s try to use the remaining allowed letters.  

A possible word: B U D G E – but G is allowed.  
Check constraints:  
- B in 3 (✓)  
- U in 2 – but U cannot be in 2 (from cubed feedback)  
Invalid.  

Another: B U E D _ – but D must be placed.  

Wait, let’s try: B U E D _ – but we need to place the fifth letter.  

This suggests we need to include an extra letter.  

Let’s try: B U E D _ – but we have only four letters.  

Realization: The word must be a permutation of B, U, E, D plus one more allowed letter.  

With B fixed in position 3, let’s try to find such a word.  

Example: B U E D F – but this is 5 letters, but F is allowed.  
Check positions:  
- 1: B (but B is in 3) – invalid.  

Actually, the pattern is _ _ B _ _.  

We need to place U, E, D plus one more letter in positions 1, 2, 4, 5.  

Let’s try: D U B E _ – but position 5 needs a letter.  

This is getting too abstract. Let’s think of actual words.  

Possible words with B in 3rd position, containing U, E, D:  
- B U D G E – but U in 2 invalid  
- B U E D _ – no  
- D U B E _ – but B is in 3, so D U B E _ – but B is in 3, so this would be D U B E _ – but B is 3rd, so positions: 1=D, 2=U, 3=B, 4=E, 5=?.  
Check constraints:  
- U is in 2 – invalid (from cubed feedback)  

Another word: D E B U _ – but B is 3rd, so positions: 1=D, 2=E, 3=B, 4=U, 5=?.  
Check constraints:  
- U is in 4 – allowed (U not restricted to 1,4,5)  
- E is in 2 – allowed (E not restricted to 1,2,5)  
- D is in 1 – allowed (D not restricted to 1,2,4)  
We need one more letter. The word must be 5 letters, so we need one more letter from remaining allowed set.  

But the word must contain B, U, E, D. That’s four letters, so the fifth must be another allowed letter.  

But we have only five positions and B is fixed in 3. So the word must be D E B U _ – but we need a fifth letter.  

This suggests we need to include an extra letter.  

Let’s try: D E B U G – but G is allowed.  
Check:  
- D in 1 – allowed  
- E in 2 – allowed  
- B in 3 – correct  
- U in 4 – allowed  
- G is allowed  

This word: D E B U G  
Check if it fits all feedback:  

From arose: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-) – E is in word, not in 5.  
From untie: U(-) – U is in word, not in 2.  
From muled: D(-) – D is in word, not in 5.  
From cubed: B in 3 (✓), U not in 2, E not in 4, D not in 5.  

This word satisfies all constraints.  

So the next guess is DEBUG.

</think>

Based on the accumulated constraints, the secret word must have B in the third position and must contain U, E, and D. After careful placement of these letters while respecting the positional restrictions, the most plausible word is:

<guess>debug</guess>",debug,"From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, N, T, I, M, L, C  
Letters that ARE in the word:  
- U (in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, or 4)  
- B (in the word and in the correct position 3)  
- E (in the word, but not in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)  
- D (in the word, but not in positions 3, 4, or 5)  

So the word pattern so far is: _ _ B _ _  
We know it must contain U and D somewhere, and E must appear exactly once (since it’s only been marked “-” so far).  
But E cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5. The only remaining spot for E is position 3, but position 3 is already B.  
This is impossible, meaning our earlier interpretation must be wrong.  

Wait: the feedback for guess 4 (cubed) shows:  
C(x) U(-) B(✓) E(-) D(-)  

This means:  
- B is in position 3 (✓)  
- U is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-)  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-)  
- D is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-)  

So the word has B in position 3, and must also contain U, E, D.  
Positions available: 1, 2, 4, 5 (but 3 is B).  
Constraints:  
- E cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (from earlier feedback).  
This is impossible because E must appear somewhere, but all positions are ruled out.  

This contradiction implies we mis-read the feedback.  
Re-examining the feedback for guess 4 (cubed):  
C(x) U(-) B(✓) E(-) D(-)  

The symbols apply to the letters in the guess order:  
- C(x) – not in word  
- U(-) – in word, wrong position (position 2)  
- B(✓) – correct position (position 3)  
- E(-) – in word, wrong position (position 4)  
- D(-) – in word, wrong position (position 5)  

So the word has:  
- B in position 3  
- U somewhere (but not position 2)  
- E somewhere (but not position 4)  
- D somewhere (but not position 5)  

The word must be 5 letters, with B in position 3.  
Possible positions for U: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but 3 is B) → 1, 4, 5  
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 3 is B) → 1, 2, 5 (but E cannot be in 5 because D must be in 5 or earlier, and D cannot be in 5)  
Wait, D cannot be in 5, so D must be in 1, 2, or 4.  
E cannot be in 4, so E must be in 1, 2, or 5.  
But 5 is possible for E only if D is in 1 or 2 or 4.  

Let’s list possible arrangements:

Pattern: _ _ B _ _  

We need to place U, E, D in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with constraints:  
- U not in 2  
- E not in 4  
- D not in 5  

Possible positions:  
- D can be in 1, 2, or 4  
- E can be in 1, 2, or 5  
- U can be in 1, 4, or 5  

We need to choose two more letters from the remaining allowed letters (since we have only 3 known letters: B, U, E, D).  

But the word is exactly 5 letters and must contain B, U, E, D. That’s four letters, so the fifth must be one of the remaining allowed letters.  

Allowed letters so far:  
Not ruled out: B, U, E, D, and any others not in {A, R, O, S, N, T, I, M, L, C}.  

Looking at the remaining common letters: F, G, H, J, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.  

We need a 5-letter word that contains B, U, E, D and one more letter from the allowed set, with B in position 3.  

Possible candidates:  
- DUBED – but has two E’s, and we don’t know if E repeats.  
- BUSED – but S is ruled out.  
- BUDGE – contains G, which is allowed. Let’s check:  
  - B in 3 (✓)  
  - U in 2 – but U cannot be in 2 (from cubed feedback)  
- BUDGE: U in 2 – invalid  
- BUDDY – has two D’s and Y  
- BUSED – S is invalid  
- BUDDY – Y is allowed, but two D’s  
- BUDDY: B U D D Y – positions: 1=B, 2=U (invalid), 3=D (but B must be in 3), so invalid  

Wait, we need B in position 3. So the pattern is: _ _ B _ _  

We have to place U, E, D in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 with constraints:  
- U not in 2  
- E not in 4  
- D not in 5  

Possible combinations:  
Let’s list possible distributions:  

Case 1: D in 1  
Then positions left: 2, 4, 5 for U, E, and one more letter.  
But we need to place U, E, and one more letter. However, we already have B, U, E, D, so the fifth letter must be one of the remaining allowed letters.  

But the word must be exactly 5 letters and must contain B, U, E, D. That means it must be a permutation of B, U, E, D plus one more letter. However, we have only four known letters, so the fifth must be another allowed letter.  

But the word must be 5 letters, and we have four required letters (B, U, E, D) plus one more. This seems complex.  

Wait, the word must contain B, U, E, D, and one more letter from the remaining allowed set.  

With B fixed in position 3, we need to arrange U, E, D plus one more letter in positions 1, 2, 4, 5.  

Let’s try to find such a word.  

Possible candidates:  
- B U D E D – but two D’s  
- B U E D _ – but D must be placed  
This is getting messy.  

Let’s step back. The constraints are:  
- B is in position 3  
- U is in the word, not in position 2  
- E is in the word, not in position 4  
- D is in the word, not in position 5  

So the word has:  
Position 3: B  
Positions 1, 2, 4, 5 must contain U, E, D and one more letter (from remaining allowed).  

Let’s list possible placements:  

Option 1: D in 1  
Then positions 2, 4, 5 must contain U, E, and one more letter.  
But E cannot be in 4, so possible:  
- D _ B U E – but position 2 is blank, need to place U or other.  
Actually, positions are: 1=D, 3=B, and need to place U, E in 2,4,5 with D already in 1.  

Wait, the word is 5 letters: _ _ B _ _  

We have letters: D, U, E, B, and one more.  

Let’s try to find a valid permutation.  

One valid word: B U D E D – but two D’s  
Another: D U B E _ – but need to place the fifth letter.  

This is tricky. Let’s try to use the remaining allowed letters.  

A possible word: B U D G E – but G is allowed.  
Check constraints:  
- B in 3 (✓)  
- U in 2 – but U cannot be in 2 (from cubed feedback)  
Invalid.  

Another: B U E D _ – but D must be placed.  

Wait, let’s try: B U E D _ – but we need to place the fifth letter.  

This suggests we need to include an extra letter.  

Let’s try: B U E D _ – but we have only four letters.  

Realization: The word must be a permutation of B, U, E, D plus one more allowed letter.  

With B fixed in position 3, let’s try to find such a word.  

Example: B U E D F – but this is 5 letters, but F is allowed.  
Check positions:  
- 1: B (but B is in 3) – invalid.  

Actually, the pattern is _ _ B _ _.  

We need to place U, E, D plus one more letter in positions 1, 2, 4, 5.  

Let’s try: D U B E _ – but position 5 needs a letter.  

This is getting too abstract. Let’s think of actual words.  

Possible words with B in 3rd position, containing U, E, D:  
- B U D G E – but U in 2 invalid  
- B U E D _ – no  
- D U B E _ – but B is in 3, so D U B E _ – but B is in 3, so this would be D U B E _ – but B is 3rd, so positions: 1=D, 2=U, 3=B, 4=E, 5=?.  
Check constraints:  
- U is in 2 – invalid (from cubed feedback)  

Another word: D E B U _ – but B is 3rd, so positions: 1=D, 2=E, 3=B, 4=U, 5=?.  
Check constraints:  
- U is in 4 – allowed (U not restricted to 1,4,5)  
- E is in 2 – allowed (E not restricted to 1,2,5)  
- D is in 1 – allowed (D not restricted to 1,2,4)  
We need one more letter. The word must be 5 letters, so we need one more letter from remaining allowed set.  

But the word must contain B, U, E, D. That’s four letters, so the fifth must be another allowed letter.  

But we have only five positions and B is fixed in 3. So the word must be D E B U _ – but we need a fifth letter.  

This suggests we need to include an extra letter.  

Let’s try: D E B U G – but G is allowed.  
Check:  
- D in 1 – allowed  
- E in 2 – allowed  
- B in 3 – correct  
- U in 4 – allowed  
- G is allowed  

This word: D E B U G  
Check if it fits all feedback:  

From arose: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-) – E is in word, not in 5.  
From untie: U(-) – U is in word, not in 2.  
From muled: D(-) – D is in word, not in 5.  
From cubed: B in 3 (✓), U not in 2, E not in 4, D not in 5.  

This word satisfies all constraints.  

So the next guess is DEBUG.Based on the accumulated constraints, the secret word must have B in the third position and must contain U, E, and D. After careful placement of these letters while respecting the positional restrictions, the most plausible word is:",Guess 5: debug -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) E(✓) B(✓) U(✓) G(✓),SUCCESS
