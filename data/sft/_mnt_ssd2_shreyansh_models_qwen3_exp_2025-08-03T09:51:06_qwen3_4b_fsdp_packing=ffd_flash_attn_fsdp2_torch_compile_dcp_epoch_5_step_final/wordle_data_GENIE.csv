### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

1. The word ends with E (position 5 is fixed).
2. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, R, O.
3. Letter N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (so N must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5; but 5 is already E, so positions 1, 2, or 3).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains N (but not in position 4).
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, C, R, O.

Remaining common letters that haven’t been ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

A good candidate is “PHONE”:
- Ends with E.
- Contains N (in position 3).
- Uses P, H, O, N, E. But O is already ruled out (from CRONE feedback), so this is invalid.

Next candidate: “MIDGE” – but D and G are okay, but I and D and G and M and E. However, this uses D, I, G, M, E – but N is missing, so invalid.

Next: “UNITE” – ends with E, has N in position 2, and uses U, N, I, T, E. But T is ruled out.

Next: “BUNNY” – but ends with Y, not E.

Next: “NINER” – but R is ruled out.

Next: “MENUE” – but U and M and E and N and U, but E is fixed at 5, and this has U twice and N in position 2. Also, “MENUE” isn’t a common word.

Next: “PENNE” – ends with E, has N in positions 2 and 4, but N in 4 is invalid (from CRONE feedback), and P, E, N, N, E – but double N might be okay, but need to check if letters are allowed. P is allowed, E is allowed, N is allowed (but not in 4). So PENNE has N in 2 and 4. Since N is allowed in 2, this might work.

But PENNE is a valid word, ends with E, has N in position 2, and uses P, E, N, N, E. Letters used: P, E, N – all allowed so far.

But let’s think of a word with distinct letters to maximize information. How about “UNNEE”? No, invalid.

“BUNGE” – ends with E, has N in position 2, uses B, U, N, G, E. B, U, N, G, E – all allowed. BUNGE is a valid word (a type of climbing equipment).

But “BUNGE” might be obscure. Next: “DUNGE” – same issue.

“MINCE” – ends with E, has N in position 2, uses M, I, N, C, E. But C is ruled out.

“FINED” – ends with D, not E.

“FINKY” – ends with Y.

“HINED” – ends with D.

“MIDGE” – ends with E, has N in position 3, uses M, I, D, G, E. Letters: M, I, D, G, E – all allowed. MIDGE is a valid word.

But PENNE is a valid word, ends with E, has N in position 2, and uses P, E, N, N, E. Letters used: P, E, N – all allowed so far.

But let’s think of a word with distinct letters to maximize information. How about “UNNEE”? No, invalid.

“BUNGE” – ends with E, has N in position 2, uses B, U, N, G, E. B, U, N, G, E – all allowed. BUNGE is a valid word (a type of climbing equipment).

But “BUNGE” might be obscure. Next: “DUNGE” – same issue.

“MINCE” – ends with E, has N in position 2, uses M, I, N, C, E. But C is ruled out.

“FINED” – ends with D, not E.

“FINKY” – ends with Y.

“HINED” – ends with D.

“MIDGE” – ends with E, has N in position 3, uses M, I, D, G, E. Letters: M, I, D, G, E – all allowed. MIDGE is a valid word.

From the feedback so far:

1. Position 5 is definitely E.
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, R, O, M, D.
3. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - N (but not in position 4)
   - I (but not in position 2)
   - G (but not in position 4)

So the word ends with E and must contain N, I, G exactly once each, and cannot contain any of the forbidden letters. The remaining letters we haven’t tested yet that are common include B, F, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains N, I, G exactly once each
- Does NOT contain any of the forbidden letters (S, L, A, T, C, R, O, M, D)

Possible structure: _ _ _ _ E with N, I, G in positions 1-3 or 4 (but N cannot be in 4, G and I have no positional restrictions except what’s given).

Let’s list possible positions:
- N can be in 1, 2, or 3
- I can be in 1, 3, or 4
- G can be in 1, 2, or 3 (since it’s not in 4)

We need two more distinct letters (not N, I, G, E, and not any forbidden letters). Let’s pick common remaining letters: B, F, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y.

Looking for valid words:
- If we try N in 1: N _ _ _ E
  - Need I and G in positions 2-3 and one more letter.
  - Example: N I G _ E – but that’s 4 letters, need 5.
  - Maybe N I _ G E – but G would be in 4, which is allowed for G (only N cannot be in 4). However, N I _ G E would be N I ? G E – but we need two new letters. This seems complex.

Alternative approach: look for known words that fit the constraints.
- The word must be 5 letters ending in E, contain N, I, G, and avoid forbidden letters.

Possible words:
- ""PINGE"" – but P, I, N, G, E. This uses P, I, N, G, E. All letters are allowed (P is new, not forbidden). Let’s check:
  - P (new, allowed)
  - I (allowed, and in position 2 – but I cannot be in position 2 from MIDGE feedback (I was in 2 and got ""-""), so this is invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word and is in the correct 5th position (✓).

So the secret word ends with E and does NOT contain S, L, A, T.  
I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is ruled out).

A strong candidate is ""CRONE"":
- Ends with E.
- Contains C, R, O, N (none of which are S, L, A, T).
- Uses common letters C, R, O, N to test new positions and letters.

- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, C, R, O.

- Uses P, H, O, N, E. But O is already ruled out (from CRONE feedback), so this is invalid.

From all feedback so far:

1. Position 5 is E (locked).
2. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, R, O, M, D, Q, U.
3. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - N (cannot be in positions 4 or 5)
   - I (cannot be in positions 2 or 3)
   - G (cannot be in position 4)

So far we have:
- _ _ _ _ E
- Must contain N, I, G exactly once each
- N can only be in positions 1 or 2 (since 3 and 4 are excluded, 5 is E)
- I can only be in positions 1 or 4 (since 2 and 3 are excluded)
- G can be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (but 4 is excluded)

We need two more distinct letters from the remaining alphabet that are not forbidden. Remaining common letters: B, F, H, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s list possible positions for N, I, G:

Option 1: N in 1
Then I and G must fit in positions 2, 3, or 4, but:
- I cannot be in 2 or 3 → I must be in 4
- G must go in 2 or 3
So structure: N G I _ E or N _ I G E
But we need two new letters. Let’s try N G I _ E → need one more letter in position 4. From remaining: B, F, H, K, P, V, W, Y
Possible words:
- N G I B E → ""NGIBE"" – not a word
- N G I F E → ""NGIFE"" – not a word
- N G I H E → ""NGIHE"" – not a word
- N G I P E → ""NGIPE"" – not a word
- N G I V E → ""NGIVE"" – not a word
- N G I W E → ""NGIWE"" – not a word
- N G I Y E → ""NGIYE"" – not a word
None of these are valid.

Option 2: N in 2
Then I must be in 1 or 4
- If I in 1: I _ N _ E
  - G must be in 3 (cannot be in 4)
  - Structure: I _ N G E → need one more letter in position 2
  - Possible letters: B, F, H, K, P, V, W, Y
  - Possible words:
    - I B N G E → ""IBNGE"" – not a word

    - Y N G I E → ""YNGIE"" – not a word
  None are valid.

Option 3: N in 3
But I cannot be in 1 or 4 (I must be in 1 or 4, but N would be in 3, so I in 1 or 4)
- I in 1: I _ N _ E
  - G must be in 1, 2, or 3 → 1 is I, 3 is N → G must be in 2

  None are valid.

After exhaustively checking, the only valid word that fits all constraints is:

""INGEN"" – but this has N twice (invalid).

""INGEN"" is invalid because N appears twice.

Wait, let’s re-examine: we need exactly one N, one I, one G, and two new letters.

Let me try ""PINGE"" – but P, I, N, G, E. P is new, but I was in position 2 in PINGE which is invalid (I cannot be in 2).

""UNIGE"" – not a word.

""VINGE"" – not a word.

""PUNGE"" – not a word.

""VUNGE"" – not a word.

""WUNGE"" – not a word.

""YUNGE"" – not a word.

""BUGIE"" – ends with E, has B, U, G, I, E – but U is forbidden.

""FINGE"" – not a word.

""HINGE"" – ends with E, has H, I, N, G, E. Let’s check:
- H (new, allowed)
- I (allowed, in position 2 – but I cannot be in 2 from MIDGE feedback (I was in 2 and got ""-""), so this is invalid.

""KINGE"" – archaic, not common.

""MINGE"" – not a word.

""PINGE"" – not a word.

""WINGE"" – not a word.

- W (new, allowed)
- H (new, allowed)
- I (allowed, in position 3 – no restriction violated)
- N (allowed, in position 4 – but N cannot be in 4 from CRONE feedback (N was in 4 and got ""-""), so this is invalid.

""YHINE"" – not a word.

""BUGNE"" – not a word.

""BUGIE"" – U forbidden.

""BUGNE"" – not a word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word and is in the correct 5th position (✓).

So the secret word ends with E and does NOT contain S, L, A, T.  
I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is ruled out).

A strong candidate is ""CRONE"":
- Ends with E.
- Contains C, R, O, N (none of which are S, L, A, T).
- Uses common letters C, R, O, N to test new positions and letters.

Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) O(x) N(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we know:

1. The word ends with E (position 5 is fixed).
2. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, R, O.
3. Letter N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (so N must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5; but 5 is already E, so positions 1, 2, or 3).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains N (but not in position 4).
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, C, R, O.

Remaining common letters that haven’t been ruled out: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

A good candidate is “PHONE”:
- Ends with E.
- Contains N (in position 3).
- Uses P, H, O, N, E. But O is already ruled out (from CRONE feedback), so this is invalid.

Next candidate: “MIDGE” – but D and G are okay, but I and D and G and M and E. However, this uses D, I, G, M, E – but N is missing, so invalid.

Next: “UNITE” – ends with E, has N in position 2, and uses U, N, I, T, E. But T is ruled out.

Next: “BUNNY” – but ends with Y, not E.

Next: “NINER” – but R is ruled out.

Next: “MENUE” – but U and M and E and N and U, but E is fixed at 5, and this has U twice and N in position 2. Also, “MENUE” isn’t a common word.

Next: “PENNE” – ends with E, has N in positions 2 and 4, but N in 4 is invalid (from CRONE feedback), and P, E, N, N, E – but double N might be okay, but need to check if letters are allowed. P is allowed, E is allowed, N is allowed (but not in 4). So PENNE has N in 2 and 4. Since N is allowed in 2, this might work.

But PENNE is a valid word, ends with E, has N in position 2, and uses P, E, N, N, E. Letters used: P, E, N – all allowed so far.

But let’s think of a word with distinct letters to maximize information. How about “UNNEE”? No, invalid.

“BUNGE” – ends with E, has N in position 2, uses B, U, N, G, E. B, U, N, G, E – all allowed. BUNGE is a valid word (a type of climbing equipment).

But “BUNGE” might be obscure. Next: “DUNGE” – same issue.

“MINCE” – ends with E, has N in position 2, uses M, I, N, C, E. But C is ruled out.

“FINED” – ends with D, not E.

“FINKY” – ends with Y.

“HINED” – ends with D.

“MIDGE” – ends with E, has N in position 3, uses M, I, D, G, E. Letters: M, I, D, G, E – all allowed. MIDGE is a valid word.

This seems good: ends with E, has N in position 3, and uses M, I, D, G, E. None of the ruled-out letters (S, L, A, T, C, R, O) are present.

Let’s go with MIDGE.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) O(x) N(-) E(✓)
Guess 3: MIDGE -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(-) D(x) G(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. Position 5 is definitely E.
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, R, O, M, D.
3. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - N (but not in position 4)
   - I (but not in position 2)
   - G (but not in position 4)

So the word ends with E and must contain N, I, G exactly once each, and cannot contain any of the forbidden letters. The remaining letters we haven’t tested yet that are common include B, F, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains N, I, G exactly once each
- Does NOT contain any of the forbidden letters (S, L, A, T, C, R, O, M, D)

Possible structure: _ _ _ _ E with N, I, G in positions 1-3 or 4 (but N cannot be in 4, G and I have no positional restrictions except what’s given).

Let’s list possible positions:
- N can be in 1, 2, or 3
- I can be in 1, 3, or 4
- G can be in 1, 2, or 3 (since it’s not in 4)

We need two more distinct letters (not N, I, G, E, and not any forbidden letters). Let’s pick common remaining letters: B, F, H, K, P, U, V, W, Y.

Looking for valid words:
- If we try N in 1: N _ _ _ E
  - Need I and G in positions 2-3 and one more letter.
  - Example: N I G _ E – but that’s 4 letters, need 5.
  - Maybe N I _ G E – but G would be in 4, which is allowed for G (only N cannot be in 4). However, N I _ G E would be N I ? G E – but we need two new letters. This seems complex.

Alternative approach: look for known words that fit the constraints.
- The word must be 5 letters ending in E, contain N, I, G, and avoid forbidden letters.

Possible words:
- ""PINGE"" – but P, I, N, G, E. This uses P, I, N, G, E. All letters are allowed (P is new, not forbidden). Let’s check:
  - P (new, allowed)
  - I (allowed, and in position 2 – but I cannot be in position 2 from MIDGE feedback (I was in 2 and got ""-""), so this is invalid.

Next: ""GINE"" – but needs 5 letters.

""UNIGE"" – not a word.

""INUGE"" – not a word.

""KINGE"" – archaic spelling, not common.

""VINGE"" – not a word.

""FINGE"" – not a word.

""PHINE"" – not a word.

""WINGE"" – not a word.

""YINGE"" – not a word.

""BUGNE"" – not a word.

""FUNGE"" – not a word.

""HUNGE"" – not a word.

""PUINGE"" – too long.

""QUINE"" – ends with E, has N in 2, I in 3, U in 1, Q in 4. Letters: Q, U, I, N, E. All allowed (Q is new). Let’s check:
- Q (new, allowed)
- U (new, allowed)
- I (allowed, in position 3 – no restriction violated)
- N (allowed, in position 2 – no restriction violated)
- E (fixed in 5)

This seems valid. QUINE is a valid word meaning a person who is a lawyer or a legal expert.

Also, “MENUE” isn’t a common word.\n\nNext: “PENNE” – ends with E, has N in positions 2 and 4, but N in 4 is invalid (from CRONE feedback), and P, E, N, N, E – but double N might be okay, but need to check if letters are allowed. P is allowed, E is allowed, N is allowed (but not in 4). So PENNE has N in 2 and 4.

From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Position 5 is fixed as E.
2. Forbidden letters (not in the word at all): S, L, A, T, C, R, O, M, D, Q, U.
3. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - N (but NOT in positions 2 or 4)
   - I (but NOT in positions 2 or 3)
   - G (but NOT in position 4)

So the word ends with E and must contain N, I, G exactly once each. The remaining two letters must be chosen from the still-allowed letters: B, F, H, J, K, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that includes N, I, G and two new letters from the allowed set, with the positional restrictions above.

Let’s list possible positions for N, I, G:
- N can be in 1 or 3 (positions 2 and 4 are excluded)
- I can be in 1 or 4 (positions 2 and 3 are excluded)
- G can be in 1 or 2 (position 4 is excluded)

We need two more distinct letters from the allowed set to fill the remaining slots.

Possible valid combinations:
- N in 1, I in 4, G in 2 → N G _ I E
  - Need one more letter in position 3. Allowed letters: B, F, H, J, K, P, V, W, X, Y, Z
  - Example: N G B I E → “NGBIE” – not a word.
  - N G F I E → “NGFIE” – not a word.

  - N G W I E → “NGWIE” – not a word.
  - N G Y I E → “NGYIE” – not a word.
  - N G Z I E → “NGZIE” – not a word.

- N in 3, I in 1, G in 2 → I G N _ E
  - Need one more letter in position 4. Allowed letters: B, F, H, J, K, P, V, W, X, Y, Z

After exhaustively checking all positional possibilities, none of the combinations seem to form valid English words. This suggests I may have missed a simpler word that fits the constraints more directly.

Let me rethink with a different approach: look for actual 5-letter words ending in E that contain N, I, G and avoid all forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- ""PINGE"" – but P is allowed, I, N, G, E. However, I was in position 2 in QUINE and got ""-"", so I cannot be in position 2. In PINGE, I is in position 3, which was also marked ""-"" in MIDGE, so I cannot be in position 3. Thus, PINGE is invalid.
- ""UNIGE"" – not a word.
- ""FUNGE"" – not a word.
- ""VINGE"" – not a word.
- ""XINGE"" – not a word.
- ""YINGE"" – not a word.
- ""ZINGE"" – not a word.
- ""BINGE"" – this is a valid word (to watch a film). Let's check:
  - B (new, allowed)
  - I (allowed, in position 2 – but I was in position 2 in QUINE and got ""-"", so this is invalid)
- ""HINGE"" – valid word. Check positions:
  - H (new, allowed)
  - I (position 2 – but I cannot be in position 2 from QUINE feedback)
- ""KINGE"" – archaic, not common.
- ""VINGE"" – not a word.
- ""WINGE"" – not a word.
- ""JINGE"" – not a word.
- ""PINGE"" – already checked.
- ""FINGE"" – not a word.
- ""BINGE"" – already checked.
- ""DINGE"" – D is forbidden.
- ""G"" is already used.
- ""QUINE"" – already used.
- ""CRONE"" – already used.
- ""MIDGE"" – already used.
- ""SLATE"" – already used.

Wait, let me double-check ""HINGE"":
- H (new, allowed)
- I (position 2 – but QUINE had I in position 3 and gave ""-"", MIDGE had I in position 2 and gave ""-"", so I cannot be in positions 2 or 3)
- N (position 3 – but N cannot be in position 4, but 3 is allowed)
- G (position 4 – but G cannot be in position 4 from MIDGE)
- E (fixed)

Thus, ""HINGE"" has G in position 4, which is invalid.

Next candidate: ""VINGE"" – not a word.

Another approach: look for words with N, I, G in different positions.

Valid word: ""INGEN"" – but ends with N, not E.

""INGOT"" – but O is forbidden.

""GIVEN"" – but ends with N, not E.

""GNIPE"" – not a word.

""IGNES"" – ends with S, not E.

""INGE"" – too short.
