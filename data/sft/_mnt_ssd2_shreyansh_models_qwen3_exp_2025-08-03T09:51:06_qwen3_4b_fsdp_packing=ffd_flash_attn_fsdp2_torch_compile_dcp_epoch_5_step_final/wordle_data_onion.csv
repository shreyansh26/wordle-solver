### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll choose a word that uses some of these letters in different positions to help narrow down possibilities.

A good starting word should also have distinct letters to avoid repeating letters unnecessarily. Words like ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", or ""STARE"" are popular choices for this reason. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters and tests vowel positions effectively.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter O, but not in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O somewhere except position 3.
- No A, R, S, E.

I want to test new common letters like T, N, L, C, I, etc. A good candidate is ""POINT"":
- P, O, I, N, T – none of A, R, S, E are present.
- O is in position 2 (not 3), so we can see if it moves or if another letter is O.

Let's try POINT.

Summary of what we know so far:
- Forbidden letters: A, R, S, E, P, T
- O is in the word, but NOT in positions 2 or 3
- I is in the word and is in position 3
- N is in the word but NOT in position 4

So the secret word looks like: _ _ I _ _ with the following constraints:
- Must contain N somewhere (but not in position 4)
- Must contain O somewhere (but not in positions 2 or 3)
- No A, R, S, E, P, T

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to place O and N in valid positions and fill the remaining slots with allowed letters.

Possible positions:
- O could be in positions 1, 4, or 5
- N could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4)

Since position 3 is already I, N could be in 1, 2, or 5
O could be in 1, 4, or 5 (but not 2 or 3)

Let's try to find a word that satisfies these constraints:
- If we put O in position 1: O _ I _ _
- If we put N in position 2: O N I _ _
- Then we need two more letters for positions 4 and 5 from the allowed set.

A valid word could be ""ONION"":
- O N I O N
- O is in position 1 (allowed)
- N is in position 2 (allowed)
- I is in position 3 (matches ✓)
- O is in position 4 (allowed, since O can't be in 2 or 3)
- N is in position 5 (allowed, since N can't be in 4)

Let's check forbidden letters: A, R, S, E, P, T – none of these are in ONION. This seems like a good candidate.
