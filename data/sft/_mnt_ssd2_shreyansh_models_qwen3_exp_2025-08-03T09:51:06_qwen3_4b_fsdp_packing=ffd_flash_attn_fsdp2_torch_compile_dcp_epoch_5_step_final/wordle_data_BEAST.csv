### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and we have no prior feedback, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word should include frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can help us quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions. This will give us valuable information for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 1st position.

- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(✓) → S is in the word and in the 4th position (last letter).

So far we know:
- The word ends with S.
- It contains A and E somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- It does NOT contain R or O.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with S.
- Contains A and E.
- Does not contain R or O.

Possible candidates could be:
- ""LEAST"" – but it has O (invalid).
- ""STEAM"" – has R? No, but let's check: S T E A M. Contains A and E, ends with S, no R or O. But it ends with M, not S. So invalid.
- ""TASTE"" – ends with E, not S. Invalid.
- ""PEASE"" – ends with E, not S. Invalid.
- ""LEANS"" – ends with S, contains A and E, no R or O. Let's check positions: L E A N S. A is in position 3, E in position 2. This fits all constraints.

Another candidate: ""SEALS"" – but S is already in position 5, and we don't know if A is in position 3 or 4. But ""SEALS"" has A in position 3, E is missing, so invalid.

""BEANS"" – ends with S, contains A and E. B E A N S. A is in position 3, E in position 2. This also fits.

Between ""LEANS"" and ""BEANS"", both are valid. ""LEANS"" uses L which is common, while ""BEANS"" uses B. Either is fine. I'll choose ""LEANS"" as it uses L which hasn't been tested yet.

Current deductions:
- Word ends with S (from arose feedback).
- Contains A and E, with A not in position 1 and E not in position 5.
- From leans feedback:
  - E is in the word and in position 2.
  - A is in the word and in position 3.
  - L and N are not in the word.

So far the pattern is: _ E A _ S

Letters still allowed (not ruled out): A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding R, O, L, N).

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4. Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, T, etc.

Possible combinations:
- B E A D S (B, D allowed)
- C E A P S (C, P allowed)
- T E A M S (T, M allowed)
- P E A K S (P, K allowed)
- F E A R S (but R is ruled out)
- H E A D S (H, D allowed)
- G E A R S (R ruled out)
- M E A T S (M, T allowed)

Among these, ""TEAMS"" is a valid word and uses T and M which are common. However, we need to check if T or M are ruled out - they aren't. But ""TEAMS"" has A in position 3 and S in position 5, which fits the pattern. However, we know from arose feedback that S is in position 5, so this is fine.

But let's verify: TEAMS - T E A M S. This has:
- E in position 2 (✓)
- A in position 3 (✓)
- Ends with S (✓)
- No R, O, L, N (✓)

This seems correct. However, ""TEAMS"" might be a good next guess to test T and M.

Another good candidate is ""PEAKS"":
- P E A K S
- P and K are allowed
- Fits all constraints

But ""PEAKS"" has K which is less common. Between TEAMS and PEAKS, TEAMS seems better.

Wait, let me double-check: TEAMS - T E A M S. This would mean position 4 is M, which hasn't been tested. This seems valid.

But let's also consider ""BEAMS"":
- B E A M S
- B and M are allowed
- Fits all constraints

""BEAMS"" is also a good choice. Between TEAMS and BEAMS, BEAMS uses B which is common and hasn't been tested.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
Guess 2: leans -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) N(x) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current deductions:
- Word ends with S (from arose feedback).
- Contains A and E, with A not in position 1 and E not in position 5.
- From leans feedback:
  - E is in the word and in position 2.
  - A is in the word and in position 3.
  - L and N are not in the word.

So far the pattern is: _ E A _ S

Letters still allowed (not ruled out): A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding R, O, L, N).

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4. Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, T, etc.

Possible combinations:
- B E A D S (B, D allowed)
- C E A P S (C, P allowed)
- T E A M S (T, M allowed)
- P E A K S (P, K allowed)
- F E A R S (but R is ruled out)
- H E A D S (H, D allowed)
- G E A R S (R ruled out)
- M E A T S (M, T allowed)

Among these, ""TEAMS"" is a valid word and uses T and M which are common. However, we need to check if T or M are ruled out - they aren't. But ""TEAMS"" has A in position 3 and S in position 5, which fits the pattern. However, we know from arose feedback that S is in position 5, so this is fine.

But let's verify: TEAMS - T E A M S. This has:
- E in position 2 (✓)
- A in position 3 (✓)
- Ends with S (✓)
- No R, O, L, N (✓)

This seems correct. However, ""TEAMS"" might be a good next guess to test T and M.

Another good candidate is ""PEAKS"":
- P E A K S
- P and K are allowed
- Fits all constraints

But ""PEAKS"" has K which is less common. Between TEAMS and PEAKS, TEAMS seems better.

Wait, let me double-check: TEAMS - T E A M S. This would mean position 4 is M, which hasn't been tested. This seems valid.

But let's also consider ""BEAMS"":
- B E A M S
- B and M are allowed
- Fits all constraints

""BEAMS"" is also a good choice. Between TEAMS and BEAMS, BEAMS uses B which is common and hasn't been tested.

I'll go with BEAMS as the next guess.

Since this is the first guess and we have no prior feedback, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word should include frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can help us quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions. This will give us valuable information for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(✓) → S is in the word and in the 4th position (last letter).
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- The word ends with S.
- It contains A and E somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- It does NOT contain R or O.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with S.
- Contains A and E.
- Does not contain R or O.

Possible candidates could be:
- ""LEAST"" – but it has O (invalid).
- ""STEAM"" – has R? No, but let's check: S T E A M. Contains A and E, ends with S, no R or O. But it ends with M, not S. So invalid.
- ""TASTE"" – ends with E, not S. Invalid.
- ""PEASE"" – ends with E, not S. Invalid.
- ""LEANS"" – ends with S, contains A and E, no R or O. Let's check positions: L E A N S. A is in position 3, E in position 2. This fits all constraints.

Another candidate: ""SEALS"" – but S is already in position 5, and we don't know if A is in position 3 or 4. But ""SEALS"" has A in position 3, E is missing, so invalid.

""BEANS"" – ends with S, contains A and E. B E A N S. A is in position 3, E in position 2. This also fits.

Between ""LEANS"" and ""BEANS"", both are valid. ""LEANS"" uses L which is common, while ""BEANS"" uses B. Either is fine. I'll choose ""LEANS"" as it uses L which hasn't been tested yet.

- From leans feedback:
  - E is in the word and in position 2.
  - A is in the word and in position 3.

So far the pattern is: _ E A _ S

Letters still allowed (not ruled out): A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding R, O, L, N).

- F E A R S (but R is ruled out)
- H E A D S (H, D allowed)
- G E A R S (R ruled out)
- M E A T S (M, T allowed)

Among these, ""TEAMS"" is a valid word and uses T and M which are common. However, we need to check if T or M are ruled out - they aren't. But ""TEAMS"" has A in position 3 and S in position 5, which fits the pattern. However, we know from arose feedback that S is in position 5, so this is fine.

But let's verify: TEAMS - T E A M S. This has:
- E in position 2 (✓)
- A in position 3 (✓)
- Ends with S (✓)
- No R, O, L, N (✓)

This seems correct. However, ""TEAMS"" might be a good next guess to test T and M.

- P and K are allowed
- Fits all constraints

But ""PEAKS"" has K which is less common. Between TEAMS and PEAKS, TEAMS seems better.

Wait, let me double-check: TEAMS - T E A M S. This would mean position 4 is M, which hasn't been tested. This seems valid.

- B E A M S
- B and M are allowed

""BEAMS"" is also a good choice. Between TEAMS and BEAMS, BEAMS uses B which is common and hasn't been tested.

I'll go with BEAMS as the next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and we have no prior feedback, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word should include frequently used letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can help us quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions. This will give us valuable information for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(✓) → S is in the word and in the 4th position (last letter).
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- The word ends with S.
- It contains A and E somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- It does NOT contain R or O.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with S.
- Contains A and E.
- Does not contain R or O.

Possible candidates could be:
- ""LEAST"" – but it has O (invalid).
- ""STEAM"" – has R? No, but let's check: S T E A M. Contains A and E, ends with S, no R or O. But it ends with M, not S. So invalid.
- ""TASTE"" – ends with E, not S. Invalid.
- ""PEASE"" – ends with E, not S. Invalid.
- ""LEANS"" – ends with S, contains A and E, no R or O. Let's check positions: L E A N S. A is in position 3, E in position 2. This fits all constraints.

Another candidate: ""SEALS"" – but S is already in position 5, and we don't know if A is in position 3 or 4. But ""SEALS"" has A in position 3, E is missing, so invalid.

""BEANS"" – ends with S, contains A and E. B E A N S. A is in position 3, E in position 2. This also fits.

Between ""LEANS"" and ""BEANS"", both are valid. ""LEANS"" uses L which is common, while ""BEANS"" uses B. Either is fine. I'll choose ""LEANS"" as it uses L which hasn't been tested yet.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
Guess 2: leans -> FEEDBACK: L(x) E(✓) A(✓) N(x) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current deductions:
- Word ends with S (from arose feedback).
- Contains A and E, with A not in position 1 and E not in position 5.
- From leans feedback:
  - E is in the word and in position 2.
  - A is in the word and in position 3.
  - L and N are not in the word.

So far the pattern is: _ E A _ S

Letters still allowed (not ruled out): A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding R, O, L, N).

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 4. Common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, T, etc.

Possible combinations:
- B E A D S (B, D allowed)
- C E A P S (C, P allowed)
- T E A M S (T, M allowed)
- P E A K S (P, K allowed)
- F E A R S (but R is ruled out)
- H E A D S (H, D allowed)
- G E A R S (R ruled out)
- M E A T S (M, T allowed)

Among these, ""TEAMS"" is a valid word and uses T and M which are common. However, we need to check if T or M are ruled out - they aren't. But ""TEAMS"" has A in position 3 and S in position 5, which fits the pattern. However, we know from arose feedback that S is in position 5, so this is fine.

But let's verify: TEAMS - T E A M S. This has:
- E in position 2 (✓)
- A in position 3 (✓)
- Ends with S (✓)
- No R, O, L, N (✓)

This seems correct. However, ""TEAMS"" might be a good next guess to test T and M.

Another good candidate is ""PEAKS"":
- P E A K S
- P and K are allowed
- Fits all constraints

But ""PEAKS"" has K which is less common. Between TEAMS and PEAKS, TEAMS seems better.

Wait, let me double-check: TEAMS - T E A M S. This would mean position 4 is M, which hasn't been tested. This seems valid.

But let's also consider ""BEAMS"":
- B E A M S
- B and M are allowed
- Fits all constraints

""BEAMS"" is also a good choice. Between TEAMS and BEAMS, BEAMS uses B which is common and hasn't been tested.

I'll go with BEAMS as the next guess.

The only remaining valid words are BEADS and BEAKS. Between these, BEAKS uses K, which is still allowed, and BEADS uses D. Both are equally likely, but BEAKS is a more common word.

However, let's verify:
- BEAKS: B E A K S
  - K is allowed (not ruled out)
  - All other letters match the locked pattern
- BEADS: B E A D S
  - D is allowed (not ruled out)

Both are valid, but BEAKS is more common. Let's choose BEAKS.",Guess 6: beaks -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) E(✓) A(✓) K(x) S(-),FAIL
