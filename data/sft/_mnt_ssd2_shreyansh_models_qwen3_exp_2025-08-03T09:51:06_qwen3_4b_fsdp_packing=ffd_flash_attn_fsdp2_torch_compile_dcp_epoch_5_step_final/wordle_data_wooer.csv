For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- O is in the word and in position 3 (✓)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So we know:
- The word has O in position 3.
- It contains R and E somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- It does not contain A or S.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has O as the third letter.
- Contains R and E in different positions (R not in position 2, E not in position 5).
- Does not contain A or S.

Let's think of words that fit this pattern. A good candidate is ""TROPE"":
- T is a common consonant.
- R is in position 2 (but we know R is not in position 2 from the feedback, so this might not work).
Wait, no - the feedback says R is in the word but not in position 2. So R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 3 is O, so R could be 1,4, or 5.

Looking at ""TROPE"":
- T R O P E
- O is in position 3 (correct).
- R is in position 2 - but feedback says R is not in position 2. So this is invalid.

Another candidate: ""ROUTE"":
- R O U T E

Next: ""ROGER"":
- R O G E R
- O is in position 2 - invalid.

""PERON"":

- O is in position 4 - invalid.

""CREDO"":
- C R E D O
- O is in position 5 - invalid.

""PROBE"":
- P R O B E
- O is in position 3 (correct).
- R is in position 2 - but feedback says R is not in position 2. So invalid.

""EXORC"":
- E X O R C
- O is in position 3 (correct).
- R is in position 4 (valid, since R can't be in position 2).
- E is in position 1 (valid, since E can't be in position 5).
This seems to fit all constraints.

Let's verify:
- Contains O in position 3 (✓)

- Contains R and E in different positions (R not in position 2, E not in position 5).
- Does not contain A or S.

Let's think of words that fit this pattern. A good candidate is ""TROPE"":
- T is a common consonant.
- R is in position 2 (but we know R is not in position 2 from the feedback, so this might not work).
Wait, no - the feedback says R is in the word but not in position 2. So R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 3 is O, so R could be 1,4, or 5.

Looking at ""TROPE"":
- T R O P E
- O is in position 3 (correct).
- R is in position 2 - but feedback says R is not in position 2. So this is invalid.

Another candidate: ""ROUTE"":
- R O U T E
- O is in position 2, but we need O in position 3. So invalid.

Next: ""ROGER"":
- R O G E R
- O is in position 2 - invalid.

""PERON"":
- P E R O N
- O is in position 4 - invalid.

""CREDO"":
- C R E D O
- O is in position 5 - invalid.

""PROBE"":
- P R O B E
- O is in position 3 (correct).
- R is in position 2 - but feedback says R is not in position 2. So invalid.

""EXORC"":
- E X O R C
- O is in position 3 (correct).
- R is in position 4 (valid, since R can't be in position 2).
- E is in position 1 (valid, since E can't be in position 5).
This seems to fit all constraints.

Let's verify:
- Contains O in position 3 (✓)
- Contains R (position 4) and E (position 1) - positions are valid
- Does not contain A or S (✓)

So ""EXORC"" seems like a good second guess.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: arose → A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(-)
- O is fixed in position 3.
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (from arose and exorc).
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 5 (from arose and exorc).
- Letters not in the word: A, S, X, C.

So far:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- R must be in position 4 or 5.
- E must be in position 2, 3, or 4. But 3 is O, so 2 or 4.
- Remaining letters: common consonants (T, N, L, D, etc.) and vowels (I, U).

Let’s try to place R and E together:
- If R is in position 4, E could be in position 2 or 4. But R is in 4, so E must be in 2.
  Pattern: _ E O R _
- If R is in position 5, E could be in position 2 or 4.
  Pattern: _ _ O _ R or _ _ O E _

Let’s test _ E O R _:
Possible words: DEORE (invalid), LEORE (invalid), MEORE (invalid) – none are valid English words.

Test _ _ O E R:
Possible words: ""POKER"" – but O is fixed in position 3, so P O K E R – but R is in position 5 (valid), E is in position 4 (valid). Check letters: P, O, K, E, R.
- O in position 3 (✓)
- R in position 5 (valid, since R can’t be in 1,2)
- E in position 4 (valid, since E can’t be in 1,5)
- Letters used: P, O, K, E, R – none of A, S, X, C appear (✓)

From the latest feedback on “poker”:
- P(x) → P is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in position 3 (already known).
- K(x) → K is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in position 4.
- R(✓) → R is in position 5.

So the pattern is now: _ _ O E R.

Letters we know are in the word and their positions:
- O at 3
- E at 4
- R at 5

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, S, X, C, P, K.

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 2. Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, T, V, W, Y, etc. Vowels left: I, U.

Let’s try common consonants for positions 1 and 2:
- If we put D in position 1 and I in position 2: D I O E R → “diero” – not a valid word.
- If we put B in position 1 and I in position 2: B I O E R → “biero” – not valid.
- If we put T in position 1 and I in position 2: T I O E R → “tiero” – not valid.
- If we put N in position 1 and I in position 2: N I O E R → “nioer” – not valid.
- If we put F in position 1 and I in position 2: F I O E R → “fiero” – valid English word (Italian origin, but accepted in Scrabble/word lists).

“Fiero” fits:
- _ _ O E R → F I O E R
- No forbidden letters (A, S, X, C, P, K) appear.
- Uses only letters we know are in the word (O, E, R) and new letters (F, I) that haven’t been ruled out.

So the next guess is “fiero”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- O is in the word and in position 3 (✓)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So we know:
- The word has O in position 3.
- It contains R and E somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- It does not contain A or S.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has O as the third letter.
- Contains R and E in different positions (R not in position 2, E not in position 5).
- Does not contain A or S.

Let's think of words that fit this pattern. A good candidate is ""TROPE"":
- T is a common consonant.
- R is in position 2 (but we know R is not in position 2 from the feedback, so this might not work).
Wait, no - the feedback says R is in the word but not in position 2. So R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 3 is O, so R could be 1,4, or 5.

Looking at ""TROPE"":
- T R O P E
- O is in position 3 (correct).
- R is in position 2 - but feedback says R is not in position 2. So this is invalid.

Another candidate: ""ROUTE"":
- R O U T E
- O is in position 2, but we need O in position 3. So invalid.

Next: ""ROGER"":
- R O G E R
- O is in position 2 - invalid.

""PERON"":
- P E R O N
- O is in position 4 - invalid.

""CREDO"":

- O is in position 5 - invalid.

""PROBE"":

- R is in position 2 - but feedback says R is not in position 2. So invalid.

""EXORC"":

Let’s summarize everything we now know.

Letters already ruled out (x):  
A, S, X, C, P, K, F, I

Letters known to be in the word and their positions:
- O must be in position 3
- E must be in position 4
- R must be in position 5

So the pattern is: _ _ O E R

The last three letters (positions 3, 4, 5) are fixed as O E R.

The only letters left to place are positions 1 and 2.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, G, H, L, M, N, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need two distinct letters from this set to fill positions 1 and 2.

Quick scan of common English 5-letter words that end in “OER”:
- “BOWER” – B and W are allowed
- “LOWER” – L and W are allowed
- “LOWER” is a valid word; let’s check its letters:
  L (allowed), O (fixed), W (allowed), E (fixed), R (fixed)
  No ruled-out letters appear.

Therefore, “LOWER” is a strong candidate.

(Other possibilities like “DOWER”, “GOWER”, etc. are also valid, but “LOWER” is the most common.)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (-)
- O is in the word and in position 3 (✓)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-)

So we know:
- The word has O in position 3.
- It contains R and E somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- It does not contain A or S.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has O as the third letter.
- Contains R and E in different positions (R not in position 2, E not in position 5).
- Does not contain A or S.

Let's think of words that fit this pattern. A good candidate is ""TROPE"":
- T is a common consonant.
- R is in position 2 (but we know R is not in position 2 from the feedback, so this might not work).
Wait, no - the feedback says R is in the word but not in position 2. So R could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 3 is O, so R could be 1,4, or 5.

Looking at ""TROPE"":
- T R O P E
- O is in position 3 (correct).
- R is in position 2 - but feedback says R is not in position 2. So this is invalid.

Another candidate: ""ROUTE"":
- R O U T E
- O is in position 2, but we need O in position 3. So invalid.

Next: ""ROGER"":
- R O G E R
- O is in position 2 - invalid.

""PERON"":
- P E R O N
- O is in position 4 - invalid.

""CREDO"":
- C R E D O
- O is in position 5 - invalid.

""PROBE"":
- P R O B E
- O is in position 3 (correct).
- R is in position 2 - but feedback says R is not in position 2. So invalid.

""EXORC"":
- E X O R C
- O is in position 3 (correct).
- R is in position 4 (valid, since R can't be in position 2).
- E is in position 1 (valid, since E can't be in position 5).
This seems to fit all constraints.

Let's verify:
- Contains O in position 3 (✓)
- Contains R (position 4) and E (position 1) - positions are valid
- Does not contain A or S (✓)

So ""EXORC"" seems like a good second guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: exorc -> FEEDBACK: E(-) X(x) O(✓) R(-) C(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: arose → A(x) R(-) O(✓) S(x) E(-)
- O is fixed in position 3.
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (from arose and exorc).
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 5 (from arose and exorc).
- Letters not in the word: A, S, X, C.

So far:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- R must be in position 4 or 5.
- E must be in position 2, 3, or 4. But 3 is O, so 2 or 4.
- Remaining letters: common consonants (T, N, L, D, etc.) and vowels (I, U).

Let’s try to place R and E together:
- If R is in position 4, E could be in position 2 or 4. But R is in 4, so E must be in 2.
  Pattern: _ E O R _
- If R is in position 5, E could be in position 2 or 4.
  Pattern: _ _ O _ R or _ _ O E _

Let’s test _ E O R _:
Possible words: DEORE (invalid), LEORE (invalid), MEORE (invalid) – none are valid English words.

Test _ _ O E R:
Possible words: ""POKER"" – but O is fixed in position 3, so P O K E R – but R is in position 5 (valid), E is in position 4 (valid). Check letters: P, O, K, E, R.
- O in position 3 (✓)
- R in position 5 (valid, since R can’t be in 1,2)
- E in position 4 (valid, since E can’t be in 1,5)
- Letters used: P, O, K, E, R – none of A, S, X, C appear (✓)

""Poker"" fits all constraints.

Guess 3: poker -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) K(x) E(✓) R(✓)

<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback on “poker”:
- P(x) → P is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in position 3 (already known).
- K(x) → K is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in position 4.
- R(✓) → R is in position 5.

So the pattern is now: _ _ O E R.

Letters we know are in the word and their positions:
- O at 3
- E at 4
- R at 5

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, S, X, C, P, K.

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 2. Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, T, V, W, Y, etc. Vowels left: I, U.

Let’s try common consonants for positions 1 and 2:
- If we put D in position 1 and I in position 2: D I O E R → “diero” – not a valid word.
- If we put B in position 1 and I in position 2: B I O E R → “biero” – not valid.
- If we put T in position 1 and I in position 2: T I O E R → “tiero” – not valid.
- If we put N in position 1 and I in position 2: N I O E R → “nioer” – not valid.
- If we put F in position 1 and I in position 2: F I O E R → “fiero” – valid English word (Italian origin, but accepted in Scrabble/word lists).

“Fiero” fits:
- _ _ O E R → F I O E R
- No forbidden letters (A, S, X, C, P, K) appear.
- Uses only letters we know are in the word (O, E, R) and new letters (F, I) that haven’t been ruled out.

So the next guess is “fiero”.

Letters known to be in the word and their positions:
- O must be in position 3

- “LOWER” – L and W are allowed
- “LOWER” is a valid word; let’s check its letters:
  L (allowed), O (fixed), W (allowed), E (fixed), R (fixed)
  No ruled-out letters appear.

Therefore, “LOWER” is a strong candidate.

(Other possibilities like “DOWER”, “GOWER”, etc. are also valid, but “LOWER” is the most common.)

From all feedback so far:

- Fixed letters:  
  O in position 3, E in position 4, R in position 5  
  → pattern: _ _ O E R

- Letters ruled out entirely:  
  A, S, X, C, P, K, F, I, L

- Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out) for positions 1 and 2:  
  B, D, G, H, M, N, T, U, V, Y, etc.

- The letter W appears in position 3 of the “lower” guess but was marked “-” (wrong position).  
  That means W is in the word but NOT in position 3 (which we already know is O).  
  So W must be in either position 1 or 2.

Therefore, one of the first two letters must be W, and the other must be one of the remaining allowed consonants.

Possible combinations:
- W _ O E R  
- _ W O E R  

Allowed consonants for the blank (besides W): B, D, G, H, M, N, T, U, V, Y

Let’s list valid English words that fit:
- W B O E R → no word  
- W D O E R → no word  
- W G O E R → no word  
- W H O E R → no word  
- W M O E R → no word

- T W O E R → no word  
- U W O E R → no word  
- V W O E R → no word  
- Y W O E R → no word  

However, the word “WORER” is not valid, but “OWER” is 4 letters.  
Wait—let’s think differently: the only 5-letter pattern left is _ W O E R or W _ O E R, and we need to find a valid word.

Valid English words fitting _ W O E R or W _ O E R:
- “OWER” is 4 letters, so not applicable.  
- “LOWER” was already guessed.  
- “OWER” is not valid.  
- “OWER” is not valid.  

Looking at the pattern W _ O E R:
- W B O E R → no  
- W H O E R → no  
- W M O E R → no  
- W N O E R → no  
- W T O E R → no  

Looking at the pattern _ W O E R:
- B W O E R → no  
- D W O E R → no  
- G W O E R → no  
- H W O E R → no  
- M W O E R → no  
- N W O E R → no  
- T W O E R → no  
- U W O E R → no  
- V W O E R → no  
- Y W O E R → no  

This suggests that none of these combinations form valid English words.  
But we know W must appear somewhere in the word (from the “lower” feedback: W was marked “-” so it is in the word).  
Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that W is in position 1 or 2, and the other letter must be chosen from the remaining allowed consonants.

Rechecking the allowed letters: B, D, G, H, M, N, T, U, V, Y.

Let’s try “OWER” plus one more letter to make 5 letters.  
Actually, the pattern is fixed as _ _ O E R, and we know W is in the word but not in position 3.  
Thus, W must be in position 1 or 2.

Let’s list all valid 5-letter words ending in “O E R” and containing W:
- “OWER” is 4 letters.  
- “OWER” is not valid.  
- “OWER” is not valid.  

Wait—let’s think of actual words ending in “OER” (positions 3-5: O E R):
- “LOWER” (already guessed)  
- “BOWER” (B W O E R)  
- “GOWER” (G W O E R)  
- “OWER” (invalid)  
- “OWER” (invalid)  

But “BOWER” is a valid word.  
Check letters in “BOWER”:
- B (allowed)  
- O (fixed)  
- W (allowed, and we know W is in the word)  
- E (fixed)  
- R (fixed)  

No ruled-out letters appear.  
Therefore, “BOWER” is the correct next guess.

(We could also try “GOWER”, but “BOWER” is more common.)
