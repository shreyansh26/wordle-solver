### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

A popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel in English

This combination should give good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct position (first letter).
- L is not in the word.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- T is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word starts with S.
- It contains A somewhere (but not in the third position).
- It does NOT contain L, T, or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep the S in the first position.
2. Move A to a different position (second, fourth, or fifth).
3. Introduce new common consonants that haven’t been ruled out (R, N, C, etc.).
4. Avoid L, T, E.

A good candidate is “SHARK”:
- Starts with S.
- Moves A to the fourth position.
- Introduces H and R, which are common and haven’t been ruled out.
- Doesn’t use any excluded letters (L, T, E).

This should help narrow down the remaining letters.

No, L is out.

SANDY → D, N, Y. A in position 2 (good). This is a valid word.

SANDY:

- A in position 2 (new position).
- N, D, Y are new letters not ruled out.

This seems the best next guess.

From the three guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is fixed in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. SHARK → S(✓) H(x) A(-) R(x) K(x)
   - Confirms S in position 1 and A not in position 3.
   - Ruled out: H, R, K.

3. SANDY → S(✓) A(✓) N(x) D(x) Y(✓)
   - S is ✓ in position 1.
   - A is ✓ in position 2.
   - Y is ✓ in position 5.
   - Ruled out: N, D.

So the pattern now is: S A _ _ Y

Letters already ruled out: L, T, E, H, R, K, N, D.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, F, G, M, P, V, W, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, O, U (A and Y are already placed).

We need two more letters for positions 3 and 4. Common combinations could be:

- S A M P Y → but P is new, M is new. ""SAMPY"" isn't a word.
- S A I L Y → L is out.
- S A C H Y → H is out.
- S A M B Y → ""SAMBY"" isn't a word.
- S A M O Y → ""SAMOY"" is a valid word (a breed of dog).

But ""SAMOY"" uses O in position 4 and M in position 3. Let's check if these letters are allowed:
- M and O haven't been ruled out.

However, ""SAMOY"" is a valid word. But let me think of more common words.

Another option: S A M P Y → ""SAMPY"" isn't valid.
S A M I Y → ""SAMITY"" is 6 letters.
S A M B Y → ""SAMBY"" isn't valid.

Wait, ""SABMY"" isn't valid.

Another approach: common 5-letter words starting with SA and ending with Y:
- SAGGY (G repeated, but G is new)
- SAUCY (U and C are new)
- SAVORY (but 6 letters)
- SALLY (L is out)
- SABBY (B repeated)
- SAWDY (not a word)

""SAGGY"" seems the most plausible:
- S A G G Y
- G is new and allowed.

But G is repeated, which might not be ideal.

""SACSY"" isn't a word.

""SAMMY"" is 5 letters:
- S A M M Y
- M is new, repeated.

But ""SAMMY"" is valid.

Another option: ""SAVY"" is 4 letters.

""SAVOR"" is 5 letters but ends with R (out).

""SAUCY"" is valid:
- S A U C Y
- U and C are new.

This seems better as it introduces two new letters without repeats.

""SAUCY"" fits the pattern S A _ _ Y and uses U and C, which haven't been ruled out.

Let's verify:
- S: position 1 ✓
- A: position 2 ✓ (from SANDY feedback)
- U: new, not ruled out
- C: new, not ruled out
- Y: position 5 ✓

This is a strong candidate.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

A popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel in English

This combination should give good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct position (first letter).
- L is not in the word.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- T is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word starts with S.
- It contains A somewhere (but not in the third position).
- It does NOT contain L, T, or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep the S in the first position.
2. Move A to a different position (second, fourth, or fifth).
3. Introduce new common consonants that haven’t been ruled out (R, N, C, etc.).
4. Avoid L, T, E.

A good candidate is “SHARK”:
- Starts with S.
- Moves A to the fourth position.
- Introduces H and R, which are common and haven’t been ruled out.
- Doesn’t use any excluded letters (L, T, E).

This should help narrow down the remaining letters.

A good next word should:
- Keep S in position 1.
- Move A to a new position (2, 4, or 5).
- Use new common letters.

Candidate: SCRAM
- S (fixed).
- C, R, M are new letters (R is actually ruled out, so this is bad).
Wait, R is ruled out from SHARK feedback. So SCRAM is invalid.

Next candidate: SNACK
- S, N, A, C, K → K is ruled out.

Next: SWAMP
- S, W, A, M, P → W, M, P are new and not ruled out. A is moved to position 3 (but feedback says A is not in position 3). So this is invalid.

Better: SNAKY is invalid (K out).

From the four guesses so far we have:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is fixed in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. SHARK → S(✓) H(x) A(-) R(x) K(x)
   - Confirms A is not in position 3.
   - Ruled out: H, R, K.

3. SANDY → S(✓) A(✓) N(x) D(x) Y(✓)
   - Confirms A is in position 2 and Y is in position 5.
   - Ruled out: N, D.

4. SAUCY → S(✓) A(✓) U(x) C(x) Y(✓)
   - Confirms A and Y again.
   - Ruled out: U, C.

So the pattern is now:
S A _ _ Y

Letters already ruled out: L, T, E, H, R, K, N, D, U, C.

Remaining common consonants: B, F, G, M, P, V, W, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, O (A and Y are already placed).

We need two more letters for positions 3 and 4. Common combinations:

- S A M P Y → ""SAMPY"" isn't a word.
- S A M I Y → ""SAMITY"" is 6 letters.
- S A B B Y → ""SABBY"" isn't a word.
- S A M M Y → ""SAMMY"" is valid.
- S A G G Y → ""SAGGY"" is valid.
- S A F F Y → ""SAFFY"" isn't a word.
- S A P P Y → ""SAPPY"" is valid.
- S A V V Y → ""SAVVEY"" isn't a word.
- S A M O Y → ""SAMOY"" is valid.

Among these, ""SAPPY"" and ""SAMMY"" are common words. ""SAPPY"" uses P twice, which might be acceptable. ""SAMMY"" uses M twice. ""SAGGY"" uses G twice. ""SAMOY"" is less common.

""SAPPY"" seems the most common and uses P, which hasn't been ruled out.

Let's verify:
- S A P P Y
- P is new and allowed (not in ruled-out list).
- Pattern matches S A _ _ Y.
- It's a valid word.

This should be the next logical guess.
