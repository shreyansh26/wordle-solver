### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should have a mix of these to quickly identify which letters are present.

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting several letters in the secret word early on. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is another strong first guess with S, L, A, T, E. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better due to the inclusion of O, which is a very common vowel.

After considering these options, ""AROSE"" seems like an excellent first guess to start narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback received.

A good first guess should have a mix of these to quickly identify which letters are present.\n\nOne such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting several letters in the secret word early on. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is another strong first guess with S, L, A, T, E. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better due to the inclusion of O, which is a very common vowel.\n\nAfter considering these options, ""AROSE"" seems like an excellent first guess to start narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback received.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'All five letters in AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) are NOT in the word.  \nThat means we can eliminate any word containing A, R, O, S, or E.  \nWe now need a 5-letter word that avoids those five letters entirely.  \nGood consonants left include B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y.  \nGood vowels left are I, U.  \n\nA balanced word using only the remaining letters is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L).  \nIt uses two of the remaining vowels (U, I) and three common consonants (N, T, L) that haven’t been ruled out.  \nThis maximizes the chance of hitting new letters quickly.\n\n<guess>UNTIL</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: UNTIL -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(-) T(-) I(-) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Letters still ruled out: A, R, O, S, E, U, L  \nLetters we know are in the word (but not in the positions shown): N, T, I  \nSo the secret word must contain N, T, I, and must avoid A, R, O, S, E, U, L.\n\nRemaining consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y  \nRemaining vowels: only I is confirmed; U is ruled out, so no other vowels are safe yet.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that:\n- contains N, T, I\n- avoids A, R, O, S, E, U, L\n- uses only the remaining letters\n\nPossible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y\n\nA word that fits: “HINTY” – but Y is sometimes a vowel, and it’s 5 letters.

Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, S, E, U, L, P  
Letters confirmed in the word (but not in the positions tried): N, T, I, Y  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains N, T, I, Y  
- avoids A, R, O, S, E, U, L, P  
- uses only the remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, M, V, W, plus the confirmed letters N, T, I, Y  

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, M, N, T, V, W, Y  

We must include N, T, I, Y and one more letter from the remaining pool.  
Let’s list possible combinations:

- N, T, I, Y, B → “BITNY” – not a valid word  
- N, T, I, Y, C → “CITYN” – not valid  
- N, T, I, Y, D → “DITNY” – not valid  
- N, T, I, Y, F → “FITNY” – not valid  
- N, T, I, Y, G → “GITYN” – not valid  
- N, T, I, Y, H → “HITYN” – not valid  
- N, T, I, Y, M → “MITYN” – not valid  
- N, T, I, Y, V → “VITYN” – not valid  
- N, T, I, Y, W → “WITYN” – not valid  

None of these form valid English words.  
Let’s try rearranging the confirmed letters with the remaining consonants.

A valid word that contains N, T, I, Y and one additional allowed consonant is “TYING” – but G is allowed, and it uses T, Y, I, N, G.  
However, we need to check if G is allowed (it wasn’t ruled out).  
Letters used: T, Y, I, N, G – all allowed.  
“TYING” is a valid English word.

Another option: “TYING” is the only common word that fits.  
Let’s verify:  
- Contains N, T, I, Y – yes  
- Avoids all ruled-out letters – yes  
- Valid word – yes  

So the next guess is “TYING”.
