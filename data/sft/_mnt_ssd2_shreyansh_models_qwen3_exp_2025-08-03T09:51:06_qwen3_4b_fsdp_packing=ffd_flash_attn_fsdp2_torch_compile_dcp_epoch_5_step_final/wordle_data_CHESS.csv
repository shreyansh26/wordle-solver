For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these. 

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 very common letters: A, R, O, S, E. This gives us a broad coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Another strong contender is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E) or ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E). However, ""AROSE"" is slightly more balanced in terms of vowel coverage (A, O, E) and common consonants (R, S).

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as the first guess because it uses 5 of the most common letters and provides good initial information about the secret word's composition.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x): A is not in the word.
- R(x): R is not in the word.
- O(x): O is not in the word.
- S(✓): S is in the word and in the 4th position.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- The word has S as its 4th letter: _ _ _ S _
- It contains E somewhere, but not at the end.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or O.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in the 4th position.
2. Has E somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3, or 5).
3. Does not contain A, R, or O.
4. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible vowels left: E (already confirmed), I, U

Let's try to find a word that fits these constraints. One good strategy is to test new consonants and the remaining vowels. A word like ""STEIN"" comes to mind, but it has E in position 2 and S in position 4, and uses T, I, N which are all common. However, ""STEIN"" has S in position 1, but we know S must be in position 4, so that's invalid.

Another option is ""LENSY"" but that's not a valid English word. ""BESOM"" has S in position 4 and E in position 1, but it uses O which is invalid.

A better choice is ""TENSE"":
- T E N S E
- S is in position 4 (✓)
- E is in positions 1 and 5, but we know E is not in position 5 (from feedback), so this has E in position 5 which is invalid.

Next, ""PEINS"" - but that's not common. ""MENSE"" isn't valid. ""VENUS"" has U and V, but S is in position 5 which is invalid.

Let's try ""SLEPT"":
- S L E P T
- S is in position 1 (invalid, must be position 4)
- Doesn't fit.

""NESTS"":
- N E S T S
- S is in position 3 and 5 (invalid positions)

""BEAST"":
- B E A S T
- A is invalid (from feedback)

""PESTO"" - has O (invalid)

""HEIST"":
- H E I S T
- S in position 4 (✓)
- E in position 2 (valid, since E can't be in position 5)
- Uses H, I, T - all new letters
- No A, R, or O

This seems perfect:
- S in position 4 (matches)
- E in position 2 (valid)
- Uses H, I, T which are new
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O)

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ S _
- Letters present: S (fixed at 4), E, H
- Letters absent: A, R, O, I, T

E can be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but 4 is S), so positions 1 or 3.
H must be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (but 4 is S).

We need a word that:
1. Has S in position 4.
2. Has E in position 1 or 3.

4. Uses only letters not in the absent list (no A, R, O, I, T).

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible vowels left: E (already confirmed), U (since A, O, I are out)

Let’s try to place E in position 1 and H in position 2:
E H _ S _
Need two more letters (positions 3 and 5) from the allowed set, avoiding E, H, S.
Looking for common letters: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, etc.

A word like ""EXHIB"" isn’t valid. ""EXHUM"" is 5 letters but has U and M:
EXHUM:
- E in 1 (valid)
- X in 2 (but we need H in 2, so invalid)
Wait, we want H in 2, E in 1, so:
E H _ S _
Looking for a valid word: ""EH"" + ""S"" in 4, need two letters.

""EH"" + ""S"" in 4: let's think of words like:
E H A S E - but A is out.
E H I S E - I is out.
E H O S E - O is out.
E H U S E - U is allowed, but is ""EHUSE"" a word? No.

Let’s try E in position 3:
_ _ E S _
H must be in 2, 3, or 5. If E is in 3, H could be in 2 or 5.

Case 1: H in 2, E in 3:
_ H E S _
Need first and fifth letters from allowed set.
Looking for common letters: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, etc.

Possible words:
B H E S S - invalid (double S)
C H E S S - invalid
D H E S S - invalid
F H E S S - invalid
G H E S S - invalid
L H E S S - invalid
M H E S S - invalid
N H E S S - invalid
P H E S S - invalid
V H E S S - invalid
W H E S S - invalid
Y H E S S - invalid
Z H E S S - invalid

None of these seem valid. Let’s try H in 5:
_ _ E S H
Need first and second letters from allowed set.

Possible words:
B E E S H - invalid (double E)
C E E S H - invalid
D E E S H - invalid
F E E S H - invalid
G E E S H - invalid
L E E S H - invalid
M E E S H - invalid
N E E S H - invalid
P E E S H - invalid
V E E S H - invalid
W E E S H - invalid
Y E E S H - invalid
Z E E S H - invalid

Still no valid word. Maybe E in position 3 with H in 2 is not working. Let’s try E in position 1 and H in 5:
E _ _ S H
Need second and third letters from allowed set.

Possible words:
E N D S H - invalid
E N V S H - invalid
E N U S H - invalid
E N V Y S H - too long
E N D Y S H - too long

Wait, let’s think of actual 5-letter words fitting _ _ E S H or similar.

Looking for words with pattern _ _ E S H:
- ""NEESH"" - invalid
- ""BEESH"" - invalid
- ""FEESH"" - invalid
- ""GEESH"" - invalid
- ""LEESH"" - invalid
- ""MEESH"" - invalid
- ""PEESH"" - invalid
- ""YEESH"" - invalid
- ""KEESH"" - invalid

None seem valid. Let’s try H in 3:
_ _ H S _
E must be in 1 or 3, but 3 is H, so E in 1:
E _ H S _
Need second letter from allowed set.

Possible words:
E N H S E - but E is in 5, which is allowed (E not in 5? Wait, original feedback said E is in word but not in 5. So E can be in 1,2,3,4, but 4 is S, so 1,2,3. In HEIST feedback, E was in 2 and marked (-), so E cannot be in 2. So E can be in 1 or 3.

In this case, E in 1, H in 3:
E _ H S _
Second letter must be from allowed set (no A,R,O,I,T).

Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for valid words:
E N H S E - but E in 5 is invalid (cannot be in 5)
E N H S A - A invalid
E N H S R - R invalid
E N H S O - O invalid
E N H S I - I invalid
E N H S T - T invalid

""ENHSE"" - invalid
""ENHSE"" - not a word.

Let’s try E in 3, H in 2:
_ H E S _
Need first and fifth letters from allowed set.

Looking for valid words:
B H E S S - invalid
C H E S S - invalid
D H E S S - invalid
F H E S S - invalid
G H E S S - invalid
L H E S S - invalid
M H E S S - invalid
N H E S S - invalid
P H E S S - invalid
V H E S S - invalid
W H E S S - invalid
Y H E S S - invalid
Z H E S S - invalid

Still no valid word. Maybe we need to try E in 3, H in 5:
_ _ E S H
Need first two letters from allowed set.

Possible words:
B E E S H - invalid
C E E S H - invalid
D E E S H - invalid
F E E S H - invalid
G E E S H - invalid
L E E S H - invalid
M E E S H - invalid
N E E S H - invalid
P E E S H - invalid
V E E S H - invalid
W E E S H - invalid
Y E E S H - invalid
Z E E S H - invalid

This is tricky. Let’s try a different approach. Maybe E in 1, H in 3:
E _ H S _
Second letter must be from allowed set. Let’s think of valid words:

""EXHUM"" - but we need H in 3, E in 1, S in 4, so pattern E _ H S _. The only valid word I can think of is ""ECHO S"" but that’s 4 letters. 

Wait, let’s list possible valid words fitting the constraints:
- S in 4
- Contains E and H
- No A, R, O, I, T
- E not in 5, H not in 1

Possible words:
- ""EXHUM"" - but has U and M, and H in 2, E in 1, S in 4: E X H U M - but S is not in 4, so invalid
- ""EXHIB"" - invalid
- ""EXHUM"" - invalid
- ""EXHUM"" - no
- ""EXHUM"" - no
- ""EXHUM"" - no
- ""EXHUM"" - no

This seems difficult. Let’s try ""EUNES"" - but not a word. 

Wait, let’s think of ""E"" in 3, H in 2:
_ H E S _
Need first and fifth letters. Let’s try ""BEHES"" - invalid
""CHESS"" - but S is in 4, so C H E S S - but S is already in 4, and we can have another S in 5? The rules don’t forbid duplicates, but let’s check if ""CHESS"" is valid.

""C H E S S"":
- C (new)
- H in 2 (valid, since H is in word but not in 1)
- E in 3 (valid, since E is in word and not in 2 or 5)
- S in 4 (✓)
- S in 5 (possible duplicate)

This seems valid and uses allowed letters. Let’s verify:
Letters used: C, H, E, S, S
Absent letters: A, R, O, I, T - none used
Positions:
- C: new, position 1
- H: in word, position 2 (not 1, so ok)
- E: in word, position 3 (not 2 or 5, so ok)
- S: in position 4 (✓)
- S: allowed duplicate

This seems like the best valid word fitting all constraints.

</think>

Based on the updated feedback, the word must have:
- S in the 4th position (✓)
- E somewhere in positions 1, 3 (not 2 or 5)
- H somewhere in positions 2, 3, 5 (not 1)
- No A, R, O, I, T

The valid word ""CHESS"" fits these constraints:
- C (new letter)
- H in position 2 (valid, not in 1)
- E in position 3 (valid, not in 2 or 5)
- S in position 4 (✓)
- S in position 5 (allowed duplicate)

<guess>CHESS</guess>",CHESS,"From the new feedback on HEIST:
- H(-): H is in the word but not in position 1.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 2 (and we already knew it’s not in position 5).
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- S(✓): S is in position 4 (confirmed again).
- T(x): T is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ S _
- Letters present: S (fixed at 4), E, H
- Letters absent: A, R, O, I, T

E can be in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but 4 is S), so positions 1 or 3.
H must be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (but 4 is S).

We need a word that:
1. Has S in position 4.
2. Has E in position 1 or 3.
3. Has H in position 2, 3, or 5 (but not 1).
4. Uses only letters not in the absent list (no A, R, O, I, T).

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible vowels left: E (already confirmed), U (since A, O, I are out)

Let’s try to place E in position 1 and H in position 2:
E H _ S _
Need two more letters (positions 3 and 5) from the allowed set, avoiding E, H, S.
Looking for common letters: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, etc.

A word like ""EXHIB"" isn’t valid. ""EXHUM"" is 5 letters but has U and M:
EXHUM:
- E in 1 (valid)
- X in 2 (but we need H in 2, so invalid)
Wait, we want H in 2, E in 1, so:
E H _ S _
Looking for a valid word: ""EH"" + ""S"" in 4, need two letters.

""EH"" + ""S"" in 4: let's think of words like:
E H A S E - but A is out.
E H I S E - I is out.
E H O S E - O is out.
E H U S E - U is allowed, but is ""EHUSE"" a word? No.

Let’s try E in position 3:
_ _ E S _
H must be in 2, 3, or 5. If E is in 3, H could be in 2 or 5.

Case 1: H in 2, E in 3:
_ H E S _
Need first and fifth letters from allowed set.
Looking for common letters: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, etc.

Possible words:

M H E S S - invalid
N H E S S - invalid
P H E S S - invalid
V H E S S - invalid
W H E S S - invalid
Y H E S S - invalid

None of these seem valid. Let’s try H in 5:

Possible words:

N E E S H - invalid
P E E S H - invalid
V E E S H - invalid
W E E S H - invalid
Y E E S H - invalid
Z E E S H - invalid

Still no valid word. Maybe E in position 3 with H in 2 is not working. Let’s try E in position 1 and H in 5:
E _ _ S H
Need second and third letters from allowed set.

Possible words:
E N D S H - invalid
E N V S H - invalid
E N U S H - invalid
E N V Y S H - too long
E N D Y S H - too long

_ _ H S _
E must be in 1 or 3, but 3 is H, so E in 1:

In this case, E in 1, H in 3:
E _ H S _
Second letter must be from allowed set (no A,R,O,I,T).

Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
