### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters in different positions.

Looking at this, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination of five different common letters will give me good information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions. I'll use ""AROSE"" as my first guess to maximize the information gained.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, E are NOT in the word

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but A cannot be first and R cannot be second.
- The word does NOT contain O, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and R (but not in their previous positions).
2. Does NOT use O, S, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to gain more information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since O and E are out).

Let’s try ""TRAIN"":
- T: new letter
- R: in position 2 (was previously in position 2, but feedback said R is in the word but not in position 2. Wait, this is a conflict. R cannot be in position 2.)

So ""TRAIN"" is invalid because R would be in position 2 again. Let’s avoid that.

Next idea: ""RATIO"" – but O is out, so no.

Another idea: ""RAILS"" – but S is out.

Let’s try ""TARIC"":
- T: new letter
- A: in position 2 (was position 1, so this is allowed)
- R: in position 3 (was position 2, so this is allowed)
- I: new letter
- C: new letter

This uses A and R in new positions and introduces T, I, C to gain more information.

But ""TARIC"" is not a common word. Let’s pick something more common.

Better choice: ""RATIO"" – but O is out. ""RATIO"" is invalid.

Next: ""RAINY"":
- R: position 1 (was position 2, so allowed)
- A: position 2 (was position 1, so allowed)
- I: new letter
- N: new letter
- Y: new letter

This seems valid and common.

But let me check another: ""RANCH"":
- R: position 1 (allowed)
- A: position 2 (allowed)
- N: new
- C: new
- H: new

This is a good common word that satisfies all constraints.

I’ll go with ""RANCH"" as the next guess.

- N(x) → N is NOT in the word
- C(-) → C is in the word but NOT in position 4

Summary of what we now know:
1. Letters that ARE in the word: R, A, C, H
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S, E, N
3. Position constraints:
   - R ≠ 1
   - A ≠ 2

We need a 5-letter word that uses the letters R, A, C, H plus one more letter (since we have 4 known letters and 5 positions). The remaining letter must come from the unused alphabet (excluding O, S, E, N).

Looking at common letters we haven't used yet: T, I, L, D, M, U, etc.

A good candidate is ""CHARI"" (but I is a vowel, and we already have A). However, ""CHARI"" isn't a valid English word.

Next idea: ""CHART"" – uses C, H, A, R, T. Let's check positions:
- C would be in position 1 (allowed, since C's restriction is position 4)
- H in position 2 (allowed, since H's restriction is position 5)
- A in position 3 (allowed, since A's restriction is position 2)

- T is a new letter

This seems valid and common. Let's verify:
- Uses C, H, A, R (all confirmed letters)
- T is a new letter to test
- All position constraints are satisfied

Therefore, ""CHART"" is a strong next guess.
