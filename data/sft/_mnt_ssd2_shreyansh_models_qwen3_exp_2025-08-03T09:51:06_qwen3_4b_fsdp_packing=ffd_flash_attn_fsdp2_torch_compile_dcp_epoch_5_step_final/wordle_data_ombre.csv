### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English are vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us coverage of multiple common letters in different positions, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:

Common letters in English are vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should have a mix of these.\n\nLooking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:\n- S (very common consonant)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (common vowel)\n- T (common consonant)\n- E (most common vowel)\n\nThis gives us coverage of multiple common letters in different positions, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).\n\nSo the secret word ends with E and does NOT contain S, L, A, T.\n\nNext, I want a word that:\n1.

From the three guesses we now know:

1. The word ends with E (position 5).
2. Forbidden letters (not in the word): S, L, A, T, C, N, D, I.
3. Required letters (must appear somewhere):
   - R (but not in positions 2 or 3 from CRONE and DORIE)
   - O (but not in position 3 from CRONE and not in position 2 from DORIE)
4. R cannot be in positions 2 or 3, so possible positions for R: 1, 4
5. O cannot be in positions 2 or 3, so possible positions for O: 1, 4

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains both R and O, with R and O not in the positions ruled out above.

Possible positions:
- R could be in 1 or 4
- O could be in 1 or 4
- Both R and O must be in different positions (since a letter can't occupy two spots).

Let's list possible combinations:
- If R is in 1, then O must be in 4
- If O is in 1, then R must be in 4

So possible patterns:
- R _ _ O E
- _ _ _ R O E (but O can't be in 3, so this is invalid)
- O _ _ R E
- _ _ _ O R E (invalid because O would be in 4 and R in 5, but R can't be in 5 because E is already there)

Thus, valid patterns are:
1. R _ _ O E
2. O _ _ R E

Let's think of words fitting these patterns without using any forbidden letters (S, L, A, T, C, N, D, I).

Pattern 1: R _ _ O E
Possible letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
We need three-letter middle part using these letters.
Example: ROUGE (but G is allowed, U is allowed, but let's check)
ROUGE: R O U G E - but O is in position 2, which is forbidden for O (from DORIE feedback O can't be in 2)
So ROUGE is invalid.

Pattern 2: O _ _ R E
Possible letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Example: MORSE - but S is forbidden
FUROR - but U is allowed, F is allowed, R is allowed, but O is in position 2 which is forbidden
GOURE - but G is allowed, O is in 1 which is allowed, U is allowed, R is allowed, E is correct
But GOURE is not a valid English word.

Another example: PROBE - but P is allowed, R is allowed, O is in 2 which is forbidden
BROKE - but B is allowed, R is allowed, O is in 2 which is forbidden

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe the word has only one R and one O, not necessarily both in the patterns above. But we know R and O must appear at least once each.

Let me list possible valid words ending in E with R and O in allowed positions:
- R _ O _ E - but O would be in 3 which is forbidden
- _ R O _ E - but O would be in 3 which is forbidden
- _ _ R O E - but O would be in 4 which is allowed, R in 3 which is forbidden
- R _ O _ E - same as above
- _ O R _ E - O in 2 is forbidden
- O _ R _ E - O in 1 is allowed, R in 3 is forbidden
- _ O _ R E - O in 2 is forbidden
- _ _ O R E - O in 3 is forbidden

It seems the only possible positions are:
- R in 1 and O in 4: R _ _ O E
- O in 1 and R in 4: O _ _ R E

Let's try R _ _ O E:
Possible words:
- RUGOE - not a word
- ROUGE - as before, invalid
- RAVOE - not a word
- RHOSE - S is forbidden

O _ _ R E:
- OGRE - but G is allowed, but word is 4 letters
- OXIRE - not a word
- OPRLE - not a word
- OMERE - not a word
- ORBE - 4 letters

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think of other words ending in E with R and O in allowed positions.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words ending in E that contain R and O, avoiding forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters: S, L, A, T, C, N, D, I
Allowed letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the already confirmed letters R, O, E.

Possible words:
- ROGER - but R is in 1 and 4, O in 2 (forbidden for O)
- ROWER - but O in 2 is forbidden
- GOURD - but ends with D which is forbidden
- FUROR - but O in 2 is forbidden
- PROBE - O in 2 is forbidden
- MORAE - but A is forbidden
- HOMER - but O in 2 is forbidden
- BURRO - but ends with O, not E
- GROPE - but P is allowed, G is allowed, R is allowed, O is in 2 is forbidden
- JUROR - but ends with R, not E
- VOGUE - but ends with E, but U is allowed, G is allowed, but O is in 2 is forbidden

Wait, let's think of words where R and O are in allowed positions:
- R _ _ O E: need middle letters from allowed set
  - R H O O E - not a word
  - R U P O E - not a word
  - R H U O E - not a word
  - R G U O E - not a word

- O _ _ R E:
  - O M B R E - but B is allowed, M is allowed, R is allowed, E is correct
  - O M P R E - but P is allowed, M is allowed, R is allowed, E is correct
  - O G R E - 4 letters
  - O B R E - 4 letters
  - O P R E - 4 letters

Actually, ""OMBRE"" is a valid word (a type of ink or a surname). Let's check:
OMBRE: O, M, B, R, E
- Ends with E (correct)
- Contains O and R
- Forbidden letters: S, L, A, T, C, N, D, I - none of these are in OMBRE
- O is in position 1 (allowed)
- R is in position 4 (allowed)

This seems valid.

Let's try OMBRE.

Based on the feedback, the word must end with E and contain R and O, with R not in positions 2 or 3 and O not in positions 2 or 3. The valid candidate fitting these constraints is ""OMBRE"".
