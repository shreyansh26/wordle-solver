For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain
2. Avoids repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible
3. Contains common letter positions (like E, A, R, O, T)

A good starting word often includes multiple vowels and common consonants. ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequently used in English

This gives us maximum coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains R and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S.

I now want a second guess that:
1. Keeps R and E in different positions (to test where they belong).
2. Avoids A, O, S entirely.
3. Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “RENTS”:
- R is now in position 1 (testing a new spot).
- E is now in position 2 (testing a new spot).
- N, T, S are new letters (though S was already ruled out, so this might not be ideal). Instead, let’s pick “RENTE” but that’s 5 letters with E repeated. A better word is “RETIN” (but I is untested). Actually, “RETIN” is valid but less common.

A more balanced word is “ENTRY”:
- R in position 1 (new spot for R).
- E in position 2 (new spot for E).
- N, T, Y are new letters.
- Avoids A, O, S.

This seems optimal.

Let’s summarize what we now know after the three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):  
A, O, S, N, T, Y, C, U

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or –):  
- E is in the word and is in position 4 (✓ at position 4).  
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from arose, entry, cruel).  
  Therefore R must be in position 1 or 5.  
- L is in the word but NOT in position 5 (– at position 5 in cruel).  
  Therefore L must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
  But position 4 is already taken by E, so L must be in 1, 2, or 3.

So far the pattern is:  
[ _ , _ , _ , E , _ ] with R and L somewhere in the remaining slots.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 4.
2. Contains R (only possible positions 1 or 5).
3. Contains L (only possible positions 1, 2, or 3).
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Let’s list possible placements:

Case 1: R in position 1  
Then word starts with R and has E in position 4.  
Possible form: R _ L _ E or R _ _ L E  
We need a valid word fitting this.  
Example: RELIE – but I is untested.  
Another: RILED – D is untested.  
RILED seems valid.

Case 2: R in position 5  
Then word ends with R and has E in position 4.  
Form: _ _ _ E R  
We need L in positions 1, 2, or 3.  
Example: L E G E R – but G is untested.  
Another: B L E E R – but B is untested.  
F L E E R – F is untested.  
F L E E R is a valid word.

Between RILED and FLEER:
- RILED uses L in position 3 (allowed) and tests D.  
- FLEER uses L in position 2 and tests F.

Both are valid, but RILED introduces D which is common.  
Let’s go with RILED.

Check: R I L E D – letters are R, I, L, E, D.  
All letters are allowed (none are in the excluded list).  
Positions:  
R is in position 1 (allowed).  
E is in position 4 (correct).  
L is in position 3 (allowed).  
I and D are new letters to test.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain
2. Avoids repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible
3. Contains common letter positions (like E, A, R, O, T)

A good starting word often includes multiple vowels and common consonants. ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequently used in English

This gives us maximum coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains R and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S.

I now want a second guess that:
1. Keeps R and E in different positions (to test where they belong).
2. Avoids A, O, S entirely.
3. Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “RENTS”:
- R is now in position 1 (testing a new spot).
- E is now in position 2 (testing a new spot).
- N, T, S are new letters (though S was already ruled out, so this might not be ideal). Instead, let’s pick “RENTE” but that’s 5 letters with E repeated. A better word is “RETIN” (but I is untested). Actually, “RETIN” is valid but less common.

A more balanced word is “ENTRY”:
- R in position 1 (new spot for R).
- E in position 2 (new spot for E).
- N, T, Y are new letters.
- Avoids A, O, S.

This seems optimal.

Guess 2: entry -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(x) T(x) R(-) Y(x)

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, O, S are absent.
   - R and E are present but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.

2. entry → E(-) N(x) T(x) R(-) Y(x)
   - N, T, Y are absent.
   - E and R are present but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.

So the secret word:
- Contains R and E exactly once each.
- R is not in positions 2 or 4.
- E is not in positions 5 or 1.
- Letters excluded so far: A, O, S, N, T, Y.

Remaining common letters to test: D, L, C, U, I, K, M, P, etc.

We need a word that:
- Has R and E in different positions (R not 2 or 4, E not 1 or 5).
- Uses new letters to maximize information.
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

Let’s try “CRUEL”:
- C, U, L are new letters.
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).

This tests C, U, L, and positions for R and E.

Let’s consolidate everything we know so far.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):  
A, O, S, N, T, Y, C, U, I, D

Letters that ARE in the word and their positional constraints:

- E is fixed in position 4 (✓ at position 4).

- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from arose, cruel, riled).  
  Therefore R must be in position 1.

- L is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (from cruel, riled).  
  Therefore L must be in position 2.

So the word must look like:  
R L _ E _

We need one more letter for positions 3 and 5.  
Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form R L _ E _.

Possible candidates:
- R L E E _ – but E is already in position 4, so duplicates are allowed only if the letter appears twice.  
  However, we have no evidence that E appears more than once.

- R L _ E _ with a single new letter in position 3 and another in position 5.

Let’s list possibilities:

1. R L E E R – but E is already in position 4, and R is already in position 1.  
   This would duplicate E in position 3, which is allowed, but we have no evidence for it.

2. R L E E D – but D is already ruled out.

3. R L E E N – N is ruled out.

4. R L E E T – T is ruled out.

5. R L E E S – S is ruled out.

6. R L E E Y – Y is ruled out.

7. R L E E A – A is ruled out.

8. R L E E K – K is available.

   Word: R L E E K → RLEEK – not a valid English word.

9. R L E E V – RLEEV – invalid.

10. R L E E G – RLEEG – invalid.

11. R L E E H – RLEE H – invalid.

12. R L E E M – RLEEM – invalid.

13. R L E E F – RLEEF – invalid.

14. R L E E B – RLEEB – invalid.

15. R L E E W – RLEE W – invalid.

16. R L E E X – RLEE X – invalid.

17. R L E E Z – RLEE Z – invalid.

This path doesn’t seem promising.

Alternative approach: position 3 and 5 must be filled with two different letters (or same letter if allowed).

Let’s look for valid English words of the form R L _ E _.

Valid words:
- R L E E R – invalid (not in dictionary)
- R L E E K – invalid
- R L E E D – invalid
- R L E E N – invalid
- R L E E T – invalid
- R L E E S – invalid
- R L E E Y – invalid
- R L E E A – invalid
- R L E E V – invalid
- R L E E G – invalid
- R L E E H – invalid
- R L E E M – invalid
- R L E E F – invalid
- R L E E B – invalid
- R L E E W – invalid
- R L E E X – invalid
- R L E E Z – invalid

Wait, let’s think differently: perhaps the word has only one E (position 4) and L in position 2, R in position 1, and the other letters are new.

Possible valid words:
- R L E E R – invalid
- R L E E K – invalid
- R L E E D – invalid
- R L E E N – invalid
- R L E E T – invalid
- R L E E S – invalid
- R L E E Y – invalid
- R L E E A – invalid
- R L E E V – invalid
- R L E E G – invalid
- R L E E H – invalid
- R L E E M – invalid
- R L E E F – invalid
- R L E E B – invalid
- R L E E W – invalid
- R L E E X – invalid
- R L E E Z – invalid

Actually, let’s use a dictionary check:

Valid 5-letter words starting with RL and having E in position 4:
- R L E E R – invalid
- R L E E K – invalid
- R L E E D – invalid
- R L E E N – invalid
- R L E E T – invalid
- R L E E S – invalid
- R L E E Y – invalid
- R L E E A – invalid
- R L E E V – invalid
- R L E E G – invalid
- R L E E H – invalid
- R L E E M – invalid
- R L E E F – invalid
- R L E E B – invalid
- R L E E W – invalid
- R L E E X – invalid
- R L E E Z – invalid

This suggests there may be no valid English words of the form R L _ E _.  
But we know there must be one. Let’s re-examine our constraints.

Wait, we said L must be in position 2 because it cannot be in 3 or 5.  
But is that correct?

From feedback:
- In cruel: L(-) means L is in the word but not in position 5.
- In riled: L(-) means L is in the word but not in position 3.

So L cannot be in positions 3 or 5, but can be in 1, 2, or 4.  
Position 4 is E, so L must be in 1 or 2.

We also have R must be in position 1 (from earlier elimination).

Therefore, R is in 1, L must be in 2, and the word is R L _ E _.

But we have no valid English word R L _ E _.  
This suggests we may have made an error in assuming L must be in 2.  
Let me re-examine L’s constraints.

L is in the word but:
- From cruel: not in position 5.
- From riled: not in position 3.

So L can be in 1, 2, or 4.  
Position 4 is E, so L can be in 1 or 2.

We have R must be in position 1 (only possible spot).  
Therefore L cannot be in 2 because R is already in 1.  
Thus, L must be in position 2.

So the word must be R L _ E _.

But no valid English word matches this pattern.  
This indicates we may need to reconsider our earlier deductions.

Wait, let’s check if R must be in position 1.

From arose: R not in 2  
From cruel: R not in 3 or 4  
From riled: R not in 1 or 5 (wait, no: riled feedback was R(-) meaning R is in the word but not in position 1).

So R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.  
This is impossible because R must be in one of the five positions.

This suggests an inconsistency. Let’s re-examine the feedback:

Guess 4: riled -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) L(-) E(✓) D(x)

The R(-) means R is in the word but NOT in position 1.

So R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5? No, that’s impossible.

Actually, the positions are:

riled: positions 1-5: R I L E D

Feedback: R(-) means R is in the word but NOT in position 1.

Similarly, from arose: R(-) means R not in position 2  
From cruel: R(-) means R not in position 3  
From riled: R(-) means R not in position 1

So R is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
Therefore R must be in position 5.

Similarly, L:

From cruel: L(-) means L not in position 5  
From riled: L(-) means L not in position 3  
So L can be in 1, 2, or 4.

E is fixed in position 4.

So L can be in 1 or 2.

Thus, the word must be either:

- _ L E E R (L in position 2)
- L _ E E R (L in position 1)

Let’s check valid words:

1. _ L E E R: need a letter in position 1.  
   Possible: B L E E R – valid word.

2. L _ E E R: need a letter in position 2.  
   Possible: L E E R _ – but E is already in 4, and we have no info on duplicates.  
   L E E R _ – but this would be 5 letters: L E E R _ – but position 5 is open.  
   However, we have no letters left to fill position 5 without using ruled-out letters.

Between the two, B L E E R is a valid word.

Let’s verify:

B L E E R – letters: B, L, E, E, R  
Check against excluded letters: B is not excluded, L is allowed, E is allowed, R is allowed.  
Positions:
- B (new)
- L (position 2 – allowed)
- E (position 3 – allowed, even though E is in 4)
- E (position 4 – correct)
- R (position 5 – allowed)

This fits all constraints.

</think>

Based on the updated positional constraints:
- E is fixed in position 4.
- R must be in position 5 (cannot be in 1,2,3,4).
- L must be in position 2 (cannot be in 3,5 and must be in 1 or 2, but 1 is open for new letters).
- We need a valid word of the form _ L _ E R.

The only valid English word fitting this pattern is:

<guess>bleer</guess>",bleer,"Let’s consolidate everything we know so far.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):  
A, O, S, N, T, Y, C, U, I, D

Letters that ARE in the word and their positional constraints:

- E is fixed in position 4 (✓ at position 4).

- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from arose, cruel, riled).  
  Therefore R must be in position 1.

- L is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (from cruel, riled).  
  Therefore L must be in position 2.

So the word must look like:  
R L _ E _

We need one more letter for positions 3 and 5.  
Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form R L _ E _.

Possible candidates:
- R L E E _ – but E is already in position 4, so duplicates are allowed only if the letter appears twice.  
  However, we have no evidence that E appears more than once.

- R L _ E _ with a single new letter in position 3 and another in position 5.

Let’s list possibilities:

1. R L E E R – but E is already in position 4, and R is already in position 1.  
   This would duplicate E in position 3, which is allowed, but we have no evidence for it.

2. R L E E D – but D is already ruled out.

3. R L E E N – N is ruled out.

4. R L E E T – T is ruled out.

5. R L E E S – S is ruled out.

6. R L E E Y – Y is ruled out.

7. R L E E A – A is ruled out.

8. R L E E K – K is available.

   Word: R L E E K → RLEEK – not a valid English word.

9. R L E E V – RLEEV – invalid.

15. R L E E W – RLEE W – invalid.

16. R L E E X – RLEE X – invalid.

17. R L E E Z – RLEE Z – invalid.

This path doesn’t seem promising.

- In riled: L(-) means L is in the word but not in position 3.

So L cannot be in positions 3 or 5, but can be in 1, 2, or 4.  
Position 4 is E, so L must be in 1 or 2.

We also have R must be in position 1 (from earlier elimination).

Therefore, R is in 1, L must be in 2, and the word is R L _ E _.

But we have no valid English word R L _ E _.

Let me re-examine L’s constraints.

L is in the word but:
- From cruel: not in position 5.

Position 4 is E, so L can be in 1 or 2.

But no valid English word matches this pattern.

Wait, let’s check if R must be in position 1.

From arose: R not in 2  
From cruel: R not in 3 or 4  
From riled: R not in 1 or 5 (wait, no: riled feedback was R(-) meaning R is in the word but not in position 1).

So R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.  
This is impossible because R must be in one of the five positions.

This suggests an inconsistency. Let’s re-examine the feedback:

Guess 4: riled -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) L(-) E(✓) D(x)

The R(-) means R is in the word but NOT in position 1.

So R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5? No, that’s impossible.

Actually, the positions are:

riled: positions 1-5: R I L E D

Feedback: R(-) means R is in the word but NOT in position 1.

Similarly, from arose: R(-) means R not in position 2  
From cruel: R(-) means R not in position 3  
From riled: R(-) means R not in position 1

So R is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
Therefore R must be in position 5.

Similarly, L:

From cruel: L(-) means L not in position 5  
From riled: L(-) means L not in position 3  
So L can be in 1, 2, or 4.

E is fixed in position 4.

So L can be in 1 or 2.

Thus, the word must be either:

- L _ E E R (L in position 1)

Let’s check valid words:

1. _ L E E R: need a letter in position 1.  
   Possible: B L E E R – valid word.

2. L _ E E R: need a letter in position 2.  
   Possible: L E E R _ – but E is already in 4, and we have no info on duplicates.  
   L E E R _ – but this would be 5 letters: L E E R _ – but position 5 is open.

Between the two, B L E E R is a valid word.

Let’s verify:

B L E E R – letters: B, L, E, E, R

Positions:
- B (new)
- L (position 2 – allowed)

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that:
1. Uses common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain
2. Avoids repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible
3. Contains common letter positions (like E, A, R, O, T)

A good starting word often includes multiple vowels and common consonants. ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequently used in English

This gives us maximum coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains R and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S.

I now want a second guess that:
1. Keeps R and E in different positions (to test where they belong).
2. Avoids A, O, S entirely.
3. Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “RENTS”:
- R is now in position 1 (testing a new spot).
- E is now in position 2 (testing a new spot).
- N, T, S are new letters (though S was already ruled out, so this might not be ideal). Instead, let’s pick “RENTE” but that’s 5 letters with E repeated. A better word is “RETIN” (but I is untested). Actually, “RETIN” is valid but less common.

A more balanced word is “ENTRY”:
- R in position 1 (new spot for R).
- E in position 2 (new spot for E).
- N, T, Y are new letters.
- Avoids A, O, S.

This seems optimal.

Guess 2: entry -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(x) T(x) R(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, O, S are absent.
   - R and E are present but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.

2. entry → E(-) N(x) T(x) R(-) Y(x)
   - N, T, Y are absent.
   - E and R are present but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.

So the secret word:
- Contains R and E exactly once each.
- R is not in positions 2 or 4.
- E is not in positions 5 or 1.
- Letters excluded so far: A, O, S, N, T, Y.

Remaining common letters to test: D, L, C, U, I, K, M, P, etc.

We need a word that:
- Has R and E in different positions (R not 2 or 4, E not 1 or 5).
- Uses new letters to maximize information.
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

Let’s try “CRUEL”:
- C, U, L are new letters.
- R is in position 3 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).

This tests C, U, L, and positions for R and E.

Guess 3: cruel -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) U(x) E(✓) L(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s summarize what we now know after the three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):  
A, O, S, N, T, Y, C, U

Letters that ARE in the word (✓ or –):  
- E is in the word and is in position 4 (✓ at position 4).  
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (from arose, entry, cruel).  
  Therefore R must be in position 1 or 5.  
- L is in the word but NOT in position 5 (– at position 5 in cruel).  
  Therefore L must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
  But position 4 is already taken by E, so L must be in 1, 2, or 3.

So far the pattern is:  
[ _ , _ , _ , E , _ ] with R and L somewhere in the remaining slots.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 4.
2. Contains R (only possible positions 1 or 5).
3. Contains L (only possible positions 1, 2, or 3).
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Let’s list possible placements:

Case 1: R in position 1  
Then word starts with R and has E in position 4.  
Possible form: R _ L _ E or R _ _ L E  
We need a valid word fitting this.  
Example: RELIE – but I is untested.  
Another: RILED – D is untested.  
RILED seems valid.

Case 2: R in position 5  
Then word ends with R and has E in position 4.  
Form: _ _ _ E R  
We need L in positions 1, 2, or 3.  
Example: L E G E R – but G is untested.  
Another: B L E E R – but B is untested.  
F L E E R – F is untested.  
F L E E R is a valid word.

Between RILED and FLEER:
- RILED uses L in position 3 (allowed) and tests D.  
- FLEER uses L in position 2 and tests F.

Both are valid, but RILED introduces D which is common.  
Let’s go with RILED.

Check: R I L E D – letters are R, I, L, E, D.  
All letters are allowed (none are in the excluded list).  
Positions:  
R is in position 1 (allowed).  
E is in position 4 (correct).  
L is in position 3 (allowed).  
I and D are new letters to test.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):  
A, O, S, N, T, Y, C, U, I, D

Letters that ARE in the word and their positional constraints:

- E is fixed in position 4 (✓ at position 4).

- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from arose, cruel, riled).  
  Therefore R must be in position 1.

- L is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (from cruel, riled).  
  Therefore L must be in position 2.

So the word must look like:  
R L _ E _

We need one more letter for positions 3 and 5.  
Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z, etc.

Possible candidates:

  However, we have no evidence that E appears more than once.

- R L _ E _ with a single new letter in position 3 and another in position 5.

Let’s list possibilities:

1. R L E E R – but E is already in position 4, and R is already in position 1.  
   This would duplicate E in position 3, which is allowed, but we have no evidence for it.

2. R L E E D – but D is already ruled out.

16. R L E E X – RLEE X – invalid.

17. R L E E Z – RLEE Z – invalid.

This path doesn’t seem promising.

Alternative approach: position 3 and 5 must be filled with two different letters (or same letter if allowed).

- R L E E M – invalid
- R L E E F – invalid
- R L E E B – invalid
- R L E E W – invalid
- R L E E X – invalid
- R L E E Z – invalid

Actually, let’s use a dictionary check:

Valid 5-letter words starting with RL and having E in position 4:
- R L E E R – invalid
- R L E E K – invalid
- R L E E D – invalid
- R L E E N – invalid
- R L E E T – invalid
- R L E E S – invalid
- R L E E Y – invalid
- R L E E A – invalid
- R L E E V – invalid
- R L E E G – invalid
- R L E E H – invalid
- R L E E M – invalid
- R L E E F – invalid
- R L E E B – invalid
- R L E E W – invalid
- R L E E X – invalid
- R L E E Z – invalid

This suggests there may be no valid English words of the form R L _ E _.  
But we know there must be one. Let’s re-examine our constraints.

Wait, we said L must be in position 2 because it cannot be in 3 or 5.  
But is that correct?

From feedback:
- In cruel: L(-) means L is in the word but not in position 5.
- In riled: L(-) means L is in the word but not in position 3.

So L cannot be in positions 3 or 5, but can be in 1, 2, or 4.  
Position 4 is E, so L must be in 1 or 2.

We also have R must be in position 1 (from earlier elimination).

Therefore, R is in 1, L must be in 2, and the word is R L _ E _.

But we have no valid English word R L _ E _.  
This suggests we may have made an error in assuming L must be in 2.  
Let me re-examine L’s constraints.

L is in the word but:
- From cruel: not in position 5.
- From riled: not in position 3.

So L can be in 1, 2, or 4.  
Position 4 is E, so L can be in 1 or 2.

We have R must be in position 1 (only possible spot).  
Therefore L cannot be in 2 because R is already in 1.  
Thus, L must be in position 2.

So the word must be R L _ E _.

But no valid English word matches this pattern.  
This indicates we may need to reconsider our earlier deductions.

Wait, let’s check if R must be in position 1.

From arose: R not in 2  
From cruel: R not in 3 or 4  
From riled: R not in 1 or 5 (wait, no: riled feedback was R(-) meaning R is in the word but not in position 1).

So R is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.  
This is impossible because R must be in one of the five positions.

This suggests an inconsistency. Let’s re-examine the feedback:

Guess 4: riled -> FEEDBACK: R(-) I(x) L(-) E(✓) D(x)

The R(-) means R is in the word but NOT in position 1.

So R cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5? No, that’s impossible.

Actually, the positions are:

riled: positions 1-5: R I L E D

Feedback: R(-) means R is in the word but NOT in position 1.

Similarly, from arose: R(-) means R not in position 2  
From cruel: R(-) means R not in position 3  
From riled: R(-) means R not in position 1

So R is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
Therefore R must be in position 5.

Similarly, L:

From cruel: L(-) means L not in position 5  
From riled: L(-) means L not in position 3  
So L can be in 1, 2, or 4.

E is fixed in position 4.

So L can be in 1 or 2.

Thus, the word must be either:

- _ L E E R (L in position 2)
- L _ E E R (L in position 1)

Let’s check valid words:

1. _ L E E R: need a letter in position 1.  
   Possible: B L E E R – valid word.

2. L _ E E R: need a letter in position 2.  
   Possible: L E E R _ – but E is already in 4, and we have no info on duplicates.  
   L E E R _ – but this would be 5 letters: L E E R _ – but position 5 is open.  
   However, we have no letters left to fill position 5 without using ruled-out letters.

Between the two, B L E E R is a valid word.

Let’s verify:

B L E E R – letters: B, L, E, E, R  
Check against excluded letters: B is not excluded, L is allowed, E is allowed, R is allowed.  
Positions:
- B (new)
- L (position 2 – allowed)
- E (position 3 – allowed, even though E is in 4)
- E (position 4 – correct)
- R (position 5 – allowed)

This fits all constraints.

<guess>bleer</guess>Based on the updated positional constraints:
- E is fixed in position 4.
- R must be in position 5 (cannot be in 1,2,3,4).
- L must be in position 2 (cannot be in 3,5 and must be in 1 or 2, but 1 is open for new letters).
- We need a valid word of the form _ L _ E R.

The only valid English word fitting this pattern is:
