2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information I can gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

Looking at these, I should pick a word that uses as many of these common letters as possible without repeating letters. Some good candidates would be words like ""AROSE"", ""STARE"", ""RAISE"", or ""ROAST"". 

""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. It doesn't have any repeating letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is not in the word (x)
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, S
- A is somewhere other than position 1
- S is somewhere other than position 4

We need a 5-letter word that contains both A and S, does NOT contain R, O, or E, and places A and S in new positions.

Good letters to try next: common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc., and the remaining vowels I, U.

Let’s try a word that puts A and S in new spots and introduces new common letters. A good candidate is ""STAIN"":
- S in position 1 (new for S)
- T, I, N are new common letters
- A in position 3 (new for A)
- No R, O, or E

This should give us more information about the positions of A and S and test new letters.
