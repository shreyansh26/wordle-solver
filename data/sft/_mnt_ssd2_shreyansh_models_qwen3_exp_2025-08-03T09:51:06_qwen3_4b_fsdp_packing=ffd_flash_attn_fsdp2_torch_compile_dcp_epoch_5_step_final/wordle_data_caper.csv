For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible without repeating letters.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It uses 5 unique letters (A, R, O, S, E) which are all among the most common.
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words, so the feedback will help narrow down possibilities significantly.
- It has a good mix of vowels and consonants, which is useful for future guesses.

This choice maximizes information gain by testing 5 high-frequency letters in one go.

From the feedback on “arose”:

A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position.  
R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position.  
O(x) – O is NOT in the word.  
S(x) – S is NOT in the word.  
E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So we know:
- Letters definitely present: A, R, E  
- Letters definitely absent: O, S  

We need a 5-letter word that contains A, R, E (each in a different position than their first-guess spot) and avoids O and S.

Let’s look for a word that:
- uses A, R, E exactly once each  
- places A not in position 1, R not in position 2, E not in position 5  
- uses two new consonants that are still common (e.g., T, N, L, D, etc.)

A good candidate is “REACT”:
- R is now in position 1 (allowed, since it was wrong in position 2).  
- E is in position 2 (allowed, since it was wrong in position 5).  
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since it was wrong in position 1).  
- C and T are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.  
- It avoids O and S.

This should help us place A, R, E more accurately while testing two new letters.

3. nerva → N(x) E(-) R(-) V(x) A(-)

Summary of what we know:

- Letters that are in the word: A, R, E (each appears once and is in the wrong position in every guess so far).
- Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S, T, N, V.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains exactly the letters A, R, E plus two new, still-untested letters (let’s call them X and Y).
- Places A, R, E in positions that have not yet been ruled out.
- Avoids O, S, T, N, V.

Remaining high-frequency letters that haven’t been tested: D, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try “MELAR”:
- It contains A, R, E (each once) plus M and L (new letters).
- Positions:
  – M (new) in 1
  – E in 2
  – L (new) in 3
  – A in 4
  – R in 5
- This tests M and L while placing A, R, E in positions that haven’t been ruled out yet.

However, we must check if any positions for A, R, E are still allowed:
- A has been in positions 1, 3, 5 (from arose, react, nerva) – all now ruled out, so A must be in position 2 or 4.
- R has been in positions 2, 1, 3 – all ruled out, so R must be in 4 or 5.
- E has been in positions 5, 2, 2 – all ruled out, so E must be in 1, 3, or 4.

“MELAR” puts A in 4, R in 5, E in 2. None of these positions are ruled out for these letters, so it’s valid.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible without repeating letters.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It uses 5 unique letters (A, R, O, S, E) which are all among the most common.
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words, so the feedback will help narrow down possibilities significantly.
- It has a good mix of vowels and consonants, which is useful for future guesses.

This choice maximizes information gain by testing 5 high-frequency letters in one go.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:

A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position.  
R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position.  
O(x) – O is NOT in the word.  
S(x) – S is NOT in the word.  
E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So we know:
- Letters definitely present: A, R, E  
- Letters definitely absent: O, S  

We need a 5-letter word that contains A, R, E (each in a different position than their first-guess spot) and avoids O and S.

Let’s look for a word that:
- uses A, R, E exactly once each  
- places A not in position 1, R not in position 2, E not in position 5  
- uses two new consonants that are still common (e.g., T, N, L, D, etc.)

A good candidate is “REACT”:
- R is now in position 1 (allowed, since it was wrong in position 2).  
- E is in position 2 (allowed, since it was wrong in position 5).  
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since it was wrong in position 1).  
- C and T are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.  
- It avoids O and S.

This should help us place A, R, E more accurately while testing two new letters.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   Letters present: A, R, E (each in wrong positions).  
   Letters absent: O, S.

2. react → R(-) E(-) A(-) C(-) T(x)  
   Letters present: R, E, A (again, all in wrong positions).  
   Letters absent: T.

So far we know:
- The secret word must contain exactly the letters A, R, E plus two new letters (let’s call them X and Y).  
- Positions already ruled out:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.  
  – R cannot be in positions 2 or 1.  
  – E cannot be in positions 5 or 2.

We still need to test a few high-frequency consonants that haven’t been used yet: N, L, D, M, etc.

Let’s try “NERVA”:
- It contains A, R, E (each once) plus N and V (new letters).  
- Positions:
  – N (new) in 1, E in 2, R in 3, V (new) in 4, A in 5.  
  – A is now in position 5 (allowed).  
  – R is now in position 3 (allowed).  
  – E is now in position 2 (allowed).  
  – N and V are new, so they’ll give us more clues.

This should help us place A, R, E correctly while testing N and V.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters in the word: A, R, E (each once)
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, T, N, V, M, L

Guess 4 (melar) gave:
M(x) E(-) L(x) A(-) R(✓)

That means:
- R is now confirmed in position 5.
- A is still in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 5 (from arose, react, nerva) or 4 (from melar).  
  The only remaining position for A is 2.
- E is still in the word but has been ruled out of positions 2, 5.  
  It can still be in 1, 3, or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with R (position 5).
- Has A in position 2.
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- Uses two new letters (since we have only A, R, E confirmed so far and the rest are ruled out).

Possible structure: _ A _ _ R

We need to place E and one more new letter.  
Let’s try E in position 1: E A _ _ R  
We need two new letters for positions 3 and 4.  
High-frequency unused letters: D, P, U, Y, etc.

A good candidate is “EAGER”:
- E A G E R  
  – Contains A (pos 2), R (pos 5), E (pos 1 and 4).  
  – Uses G (new letter) and E again (but E is already known to be in the word once).  
  However, this repeats E, which might not be useful.

Another candidate: “EAGER” is invalid because it repeats E.  
Next: “E A P _ R” – but we need a valid word.

Let’s try “E A R _ R” – but R is already in position 5.

Instead, try “E A _ _ R” with E in position 1 and another letter in 3 and 4.  
Valid word: “E A R L R” – invalid.

Another approach: use E in position 3 or 4.  
Structure: _ A E _ R or _ A _ E R.

Try “D A E R” – but needs 5 letters ending with R.  
“DA E R” – no.

Try “C A R E R” – but C and E are already partially known.

Wait, we have only A, R, E confirmed, and need two new letters.  
Let’s try “E A R D Y” – but ends with Y, not R.

Let’s systematically list possible words ending with R, with A in position 2, and one E somewhere.

Possible words:
- E A R _ R – invalid (R already in 5)
- _ A E _ R – e.g., “D A E R” – no.
- _ A _ E R – e.g., “D A R E R” – no.
- _ A _ _ R with E in 3 or 4.

Actually, we need a 5-letter word with:
- 2nd letter A
- 5th letter R
- Contains E once, not in positions 2 or 5
- Two other new letters.

Let’s list valid English words matching “_ A _ _ R” with E in 1, 3, or 4.

Examples:
- E A G E R – repeats E, but uses G (new letter)
- E A R L R – invalid
- E A R M R – invalid
- E A R D R – invalid
- E A R S R – invalid (S already ruled out)

Next: E in position 3:
- _ A E _ R – e.g., “D A E R” – no.
- “C A E R” – no.
- “B A E R” – no.

E in position 4:
- _ A _ E R – e.g., “D A R E R” – no.
- “C A R E R” – no.
- “B A R E R” – no.

This is tricky. Let’s try “E A G E R” even though it repeats E, because G is new and will give info.

But “EAGER” is a valid word: E A G E R.

It has:
- E in 1 (allowed)
- A in 2 (required)
- G in 3 (new)
- E in 4 (allowed, even though it repeats – we know E is only once, so this will confirm it’s in 1)
- R in 5 (confirmed)

This seems the best next guess.

<guess>eager</guess>",eager,"From the feedback so far:

- Letters in the word: A, R, E (each once)
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, T, N, V, M, L

Guess 4 (melar) gave:
M(x) E(-) L(x) A(-) R(✓)

That means:
- R is now confirmed in position 5.
- A is still in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 5 (from arose, react, nerva) or 4 (from melar).  
  The only remaining position for A is 2.
- E is still in the word but has been ruled out of positions 2, 5.  
  It can still be in 1, 3, or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with R (position 5).
- Has A in position 2.
- Contains E somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- Uses two new letters (since we have only A, R, E confirmed so far and the rest are ruled out).

Possible structure: _ A _ _ R

We need to place E and one more new letter.  
Let’s try E in position 1: E A _ _ R  
We need two new letters for positions 3 and 4.  
High-frequency unused letters: D, P, U, Y, etc.

A good candidate is “EAGER”:
- E A G E R  
  – Contains A (pos 2), R (pos 5), E (pos 1 and 4).  
  – Uses G (new letter) and E again (but E is already known to be in the word once).  
  However, this repeats E, which might not be useful.

Another candidate: “EAGER” is invalid because it repeats E.  
Next: “E A P _ R” – but we need a valid word.

Let’s try “E A R _ R” – but R is already in position 5.

Instead, try “E A _ _ R” with E in position 1 and another letter in 3 and 4.  
Valid word: “E A R L R” – invalid.

Another approach: use E in position 3 or 4.  
Structure: _ A E _ R or _ A _ E R.

Try “D A E R” – but needs 5 letters ending with R.  
“DA E R” – no.

Try “C A R E R” – but C and E are already partially known.

Wait, we have only A, R, E confirmed, and need two new letters.  
Let’s try “E A R D Y” – but ends with Y, not R.

Let’s systematically list possible words ending with R, with A in position 2, and one E somewhere.

Possible words:
- E A R _ R – invalid (R already in 5)
- _ A E _ R – e.g., “D A E R” – no.
- _ A _ E R – e.g., “D A R E R” – no.
- _ A _ _ R with E in 3 or 4.

Actually, we need a 5-letter word with:
- 2nd letter A
- 5th letter R
- Contains E once, not in positions 2 or 5
- Two other new letters.

Let’s list valid English words matching “_ A _ _ R” with E in 1, 3, or 4.

Examples:
- E A G E R – repeats E, but uses G (new letter)
- E A R L R – invalid
- E A R M R – invalid
- E A R D R – invalid
- E A R S R – invalid (S already ruled out)

Next: E in position 3:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible without repeating letters.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It uses 5 unique letters (A, R, O, S, E) which are all among the most common.
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words, so the feedback will help narrow down possibilities significantly.
- It has a good mix of vowels and consonants, which is useful for future guesses.

This choice maximizes information gain by testing 5 high-frequency letters in one go.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:

A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position.  
R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position.  
O(x) – O is NOT in the word.  
S(x) – S is NOT in the word.  
E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So we know:
- Letters definitely present: A, R, E  
- Letters definitely absent: O, S  

We need a 5-letter word that contains A, R, E (each in a different position than their first-guess spot) and avoids O and S.

Let’s look for a word that:
- uses A, R, E exactly once each  
- places A not in position 1, R not in position 2, E not in position 5  
- uses two new consonants that are still common (e.g., T, N, L, D, etc.)

A good candidate is “REACT”:
- R is now in position 1 (allowed, since it was wrong in position 2).  
- E is in position 2 (allowed, since it was wrong in position 5).  
- A is in position 3 (allowed, since it was wrong in position 1).  
- C and T are new letters that haven’t been tested yet.  
- It avoids O and S.

This should help us place A, R, E more accurately while testing two new letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: react -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) A(-) C(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   Letters present: A, R, E (each in wrong positions).  
   Letters absent: O, S.

2. react → R(-) E(-) A(-) C(-) T(x)  
   Letters present: R, E, A (again, all in wrong positions).  
   Letters absent: T.

So far we know:
- The secret word must contain exactly the letters A, R, E plus two new letters (let’s call them X and Y).  
- Positions already ruled out:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.  
  – R cannot be in positions 2 or 1.  
  – E cannot be in positions 5 or 2.

We still need to test a few high-frequency consonants that haven’t been used yet: N, L, D, M, etc.

Let’s try “NERVA”:
- It contains A, R, E (each once) plus N and V (new letters).  
- Positions:
  – N (new) in 1, E in 2, R in 3, V (new) in 4, A in 5.  
  – A is now in position 5 (allowed).  
  – R is now in position 3 (allowed).  
  – E is now in position 2 (allowed).  
  – N and V are new, so they’ll give us more clues.

This should help us place A, R, E correctly while testing N and V.

Guess 3: nerva -> FEEDBACK: N(x) E(-) R(-) V(x) A(-)

We now have three rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
2. react → R(-) E(-) A(-) C(-) T(x)
3. nerva → N(x) E(-) R(-) V(x) A(-)

Summary of what we know:

- Letters that are in the word: A, R, E (each appears once and is in the wrong position in every guess so far).
- Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S, T, N, V.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains exactly the letters A, R, E plus two new, still-untested letters (let’s call them X and Y).
- Places A, R, E in positions that have not yet been ruled out.
- Avoids O, S, T, N, V.

Remaining high-frequency letters that haven’t been tested: D, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s try “MELAR”:
- It contains A, R, E (each once) plus M and L (new letters).
- Positions:
  – M (new) in 1
  – E in 2
  – L (new) in 3
  – A in 4
  – R in 5
- This tests M and L while placing A, R, E in positions that haven’t been ruled out yet.

However, we must check if any positions for A, R, E are still allowed:
- A has been in positions 1, 3, 5 (from arose, react, nerva) – all now ruled out, so A must be in position 2 or 4.
- R has been in positions 2, 1, 3 – all ruled out, so R must be in 4 or 5.
- E has been in positions 5, 2, 2 – all ruled out, so E must be in 1, 3, or 4.

“MELAR” puts A in 4, R in 5, E in 2. None of these positions are ruled out for these letters, so it’s valid.

Let’s go with this guess.

From the feedback on Guess 5 (eager):

E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
A(✓) – A is correctly placed in position 2.  
G(x) – G is NOT in the word.  
E(✓) – E is correctly placed in position 4.  
R(✓) – R is correctly placed in position 5.

So the pattern is now:
_ A _ E R

Letters confirmed so far: A, R, E  
Letters ruled out: O, S, T, N, V, M, L, G

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2 and E in position 4.  
- Ends with ER.  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining high-frequency letters: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, P, U, W, Y, etc.

Let’s look for valid words matching “_ A _ E R”.

Examples:
- B A D E R – valid word (a type of bird).  
- C A B E R – not a standard word.  
- D A I E R – valid word.  
- F A C E R – valid word.  
- P A D E R – not common.  
- W A D E R – valid word.

Among these, “B A D E R”, “D A I E R”, “F A C E R”, “W A D E R” are all valid.  
We need to pick one that uses new letters to maximize information.

“B A D E R” uses B and D (both new).  
“D A I E R” uses D and I (both new).  
“F A C E R” uses F and C (both new).  
“W A D E R” uses W and D (both new).

Any of these would work, but let’s choose “B A D E R” as it tests B and D.

Pattern: _ A D E R → “B A D E R” fits perfectly.
