For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should ideally include several of these letters to quickly identify which ones are in the secret word.

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has no repeated letters. This gives us a high chance of hitting at least one correct letter or knowing which letters are not in the word at all.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should ideally include several of these letters to quickly identify which ones are in the secret word.

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has no repeated letters. This gives us a high chance of hitting at least one correct letter or knowing which letters are not in the word at all.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E
- Letter that IS in the word: O (but not in position 3)

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O (but not in position 3).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

Let’s list some common letters we haven’t tried yet: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, H, etc.

A good next guess should introduce several new common letters. One such word is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all new letters.
- O is included (and it’s in position 2, so it won’t conflict with the previous feedback).

Let’s check:
- O is in the word (feedback said it’s in the word, just not in position 3). In POINT, O is in position 2, which is fine.
- P, I, N, T are all new letters we haven’t tested yet.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters.

So far we know:
- The secret word has an O in position 2.
- Eliminated letters: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with O in position 2 and no eliminated letters.  
Let’s brainstorm candidates:
- B O _ _ _ → BOLDY, BOGUS (but U/S already eliminated), BOBBY (B twice allowed), BOCES (but E eliminated) → BOLDY is invalid (D/Y not confirmed).
- C O _ _ _ → COULD (U/L/D not confirmed), COBOL (B allowed), COMBO (M/B allowed).
- D O _ _ _ → DOUBT (U/T eliminated), DOGMA (G/M/A eliminated), DOUGH (G/H not confirmed).
- F O _ _ _ → FOCAL (C/A/L not confirmed), FOULS (S eliminated).
- G O _ _ _ → GOOFY (G twice allowed, O allowed), GOLEM (L/E/M eliminated).
- L O _ _ _ → LOUDS (S eliminated), LOVER (E/R eliminated).
- M O _ _ _ → MOULD (U/L/D not confirmed), MOMMY (M twice allowed).
- U O _ _ _ → UMBRA (B/R eliminated), UNDER (E/R eliminated).

The best candidate that uses fresh letters and fits the pattern is **COMBO**:
- C, O, M, B, O → O in position 2 (✓), and C, M, B are new letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should ideally include several of these letters to quickly identify which ones are in the secret word.

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has no repeated letters. This gives us a high chance of hitting at least one correct letter or knowing which letters are not in the word at all.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E
- Letter that IS in the word: O (but not in position 3)

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O (but not in position 3).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, S, E.

Let’s list some common letters we haven’t tried yet: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, H, etc.

A good next guess should introduce several new common letters. One such word is “POINT”:
- P, I, N, T are all new letters.
- O is included (and it’s in position 2, so it won’t conflict with the previous feedback).

Let’s check:
- O is in the word (feedback said it’s in the word, just not in position 3). In POINT, O is in position 2, which is fine.
- P, I, N, T are all new letters we haven’t tested yet.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – Letters eliminated: A, R, S, E  
   – O is in the word, but not in position 3.

2. POINT → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   – Letters eliminated: P, I, N, T  
   – O is in position 2 and is correct.

So far we know:
- The secret word has an O in position 2.
- Eliminated letters: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with O in position 2 and no eliminated letters.  
Let’s brainstorm candidates:
- B O _ _ _ → BOLDY, BOGUS (but U/S already eliminated), BOBBY (B twice allowed), BOCES (but E eliminated) → BOLDY is invalid (D/Y not confirmed).
- C O _ _ _ → COULD (U/L/D not confirmed), COBOL (B allowed), COMBO (M/B allowed).
- D O _ _ _ → DOUBT (U/T eliminated), DOGMA (G/M/A eliminated), DOUGH (G/H not confirmed).
- F O _ _ _ → FOCAL (C/A/L not confirmed), FOULS (S eliminated).
- G O _ _ _ → GOOFY (G twice allowed, O allowed), GOLEM (L/E/M eliminated).
- L O _ _ _ → LOUDS (S eliminated), LOVER (E/R eliminated).
- M O _ _ _ → MOULD (U/L/D not confirmed), MOMMY (M twice allowed).
- U O _ _ _ → UMBRA (B/R eliminated), UNDER (E/R eliminated).

The best candidate that uses fresh letters and fits the pattern is **COMBO**:
- C, O, M, B, O → O in position 2 (✓), and C, M, B are new letters.
- No eliminated letters appear.

Let’s choose COMBO.

   – O is in the word, but not in position 3.

2. POINT → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   – Letters eliminated: P, I, N, T  
   – O is in position 2 and is correct.

3. COMBO → C(x) O(✓) M(-) B(x) O(-)  
   – Letters eliminated: C, B  
   – O is in position 2 (✓) and also appears in the word, but not in position 5 (since the second O got “-”).
   – M is in the word but not in position 4.

So the word has:
- O fixed in position 2.
- Another O somewhere else (positions 1, 3, or 4 – but not 5).
- Contains M, but M is not in position 4.
- Eliminated letters so far: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, B.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried: D, F, G, H, L, U, Y, K, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2.
- One more O in positions 1, 3, or 4.
- Must contain M (but not in position 4).
- No eliminated letters.

Let’s list possibilities:

- O in position 2 and another O in position 1:  
  O _ _ _ _ → but we need M somewhere.  
  O M _ _ _ → OMITS (I/T eliminated), OMINO (I/N eliminated), OMEGA (E/A eliminated).  
  O _ M _ _ → O M M O _ (invalid), O _ _ M _ → need to fit another O.

- O in position 2 and another O in position 3:  
  _ O O _ _ → need M somewhere.  
  M O O _ _ → MOONS (S eliminated), M O O _ _ → MOORK (K/R not confirmed).  
  _ O O M _ → but then M is in position 4, which is invalid (from COMBO feedback, M is not in position 4).

- O in position 2 and another O in position 4:  
  _ O _ O _ → need M somewhere.  
  M O _ O _ → MOULD (U/L/D not confirmed), MOYEN (E/N eliminated).  
  _ O M O _ → O M O _ _ → O M O N _ (N eliminated), O M O _ _ → O M O K _ (K not confirmed).

The only candidate that fits all constraints and uses fresh letters is **MOULD**:
- M in position 1 (allowed, since M is not restricted to any position except not 4).  
- O in positions 2 and 4.  
- U, L, D are new letters.

From all feedback we now have:

1. Positions 1 and 2 are fixed: M O  
2. Position 3 is L (✓)  
3. Position 4 is L (-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 4  
4. Position 5 is Y (✓)  

So the pattern is:  
M O L _ Y  

We need a single letter for position 4 that:
- Has not been eliminated (letters already ruled out: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, B, U, D)  
- Has not been used yet (F, G, H, K, V, W, etc.)  
- Makes a valid 5-letter English word.

Possible letters for position 4: F, G, H, K, V, W, X, Z (but X and Z are rare in 5-letter words).

Check valid words:
- MOLFY – not a word  
- MOLGY – not a word  
- MOLHY – not a word  
- MOLKY – valid (means “smoky”)  
- MOLVY – not a word  
- MOLWY – not a word  

The only valid word left is **MOLKY**.
