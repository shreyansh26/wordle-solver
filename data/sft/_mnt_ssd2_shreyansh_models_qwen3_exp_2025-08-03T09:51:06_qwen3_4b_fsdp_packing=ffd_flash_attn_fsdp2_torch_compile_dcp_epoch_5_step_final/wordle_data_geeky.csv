Popular first guesses include:

- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (x): S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R  
Letters confirmed in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: E (and E is NOT in position 5, because in SLATE it was in position 5 and marked “-”, and in CHORE it was in position 4 and still marked “-”).

So E must appear somewhere in positions 1–3.

Remaining common consonants that have not been tested yet: N, D, G, B, F, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (A and O are ruled out, E is already known to be present).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E exactly once (because the feedback never said “E appears twice”).
- Places E in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.

A good candidate is “MIDGE”:
- Letters: M, I, D, G, E  
- E is in position 5 again, but that’s impossible because we already know E is NOT in position 5.  
So let’s swap E to position 3: “MIDGE” (but that’s not a valid English word).

Next candidate: “DINGE” – invalid.  
“BINGE” – valid word, E in position 5 again, so no.  
“PINE” – too short.  
“WIDGE” – invalid.  
“VINE” – too short.  
“NIGEL” – invalid (L is ruled out).  
“GIVEN” – E in position 5 again.  
“BEGUN” – E in position 2 (valid), letters: B, E, G, U, N – all untested except U (which is fine).  
This satisfies:
- Contains E (position 2).
- Uses only fresh letters (B, G, U, N).
- E is in position 2 (allowed).

Therefore, “BEGUN” is a strong next guess.

Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: CHORE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) O(x) R(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (x): S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R  
Letters confirmed in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: E (and E is NOT in position 5, because in SLATE it was in position 5 and marked “-”, and in CHORE it was in position 4 and still marked “-”).

So E must appear somewhere in positions 1–3.

Remaining common consonants that have not been tested yet: N, D, G, B, F, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (A and O are ruled out, E is already known to be present).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E exactly once (because the feedback never said “E appears twice”).
- Places E in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.

A good candidate is “MIDGE”:
- Letters: M, I, D, G, E  
- E is in position 5 again, but that’s impossible because we already know E is NOT in position 5.  
So let’s swap E to position 3: “MIDGE” (but that’s not a valid English word).

Next candidate: “DINGE” – invalid.  
“BINGE” – valid word, E in position 5 again, so no.  
“PINE” – too short.  
“WIDGE” – invalid.  
“VINE” – too short.  
“NIGEL” – invalid (L is ruled out).  
“GIVEN” – E in position 5 again.  
“BEGUN” – E in position 2 (valid), letters: B, E, G, U, N – all untested except U (which is fine).  
This satisfies:
- Contains E (position 2).
- Uses only fresh letters (B, G, U, N).
- E is in position 2 (allowed).

Therefore, “BEGUN” is a strong next guess.

Current deductions:

Letters NOT in the word (x):  
S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R, B, U, N

Letters confirmed in the word:
- E is in position 2 (✓)  
- G is in the word but not in position 3 (-)

So the pattern so far is:  
_ E _ _ _

We need to place G somewhere other than position 3.  
Remaining untested letters (common ones): D, F, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We must pick a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 2.
2. Contains G somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5).
3. Uses only the allowed letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting letters include S, T, R, N, L, etc., while common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. A good starting word should cover these letters efficiently.

Popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's widely considered one of the best starting words due to its combination of common consonants and vowels.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains an E, but not in position 5.
- The word does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

Next, we want a word that:
- Includes E (and not in position 5).
- Avoids S, L, A, T.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to test: R, N, C, H, M, P, B, F, G, K, etc.
Good vowels to test: I, O, U (since A is ruled out).

A strong next guess should cover new common letters. Let's try ""CRONE"":
- C, R, O, N, E
- E is in position 5 here, but we know E isn't in position 5 from SLATE, so this would test E in position 5 again, which isn't helpful. Let's choose ""CRIMP"" instead:
- C, R, I, M, P
- All new letters except E isn't tested here, but we want to test new consonants and vowels.

Wait, let's pick a word that definitely includes E in a different position. ""CHORE"" would put E in position 4, but H and O are good letters. However, ""CHORE"" has O which we haven't tested yet.

But ""CHORE"" has O which is a good vowel to test. However, we should prioritize consonants first. Let's try ""CRIMP"" which tests C, R, I, M, P - all new letters.

But let's pick a word that definitely includes E in a different position. ""CHORE"" puts E in position 4, which is new. Let's go with ""CHORE"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: CHORE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) O(x) R(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (x): S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R  
Letters confirmed in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: E (and E is NOT in position 5, because in SLATE it was in position 5 and marked “-”, and in CHORE it was in position 4 and still marked “-”).

So E must appear somewhere in positions 1–3.

Remaining common consonants that have not been tested yet: N, D, G, B, F, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (A and O are ruled out, E is already known to be present).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E exactly once (because the feedback never said “E appears twice”).
- Places E in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.

A good candidate is “MIDGE”:
- Letters: M, I, D, G, E  
- E is in position 5 again, but that’s impossible because we already know E is NOT in position 5.  
So let’s swap E to position 3: “MIDGE” (but that’s not a valid English word).

Next candidate: “DINGE” – invalid.  
“BINGE” – valid word, E in position 5 again, so no.  
“PINE” – too short.  
“WIDGE” – invalid.  
“VINE” – too short.  
“NIGEL” – invalid (L is ruled out).  
“GIVEN” – E in position 5 again.  
“BEGUN” – E in position 2 (valid), letters: B, E, G, U, N – all untested except U (which is fine).  
This satisfies:
- Contains E (position 2).
- Uses only fresh letters (B, G, U, N).
- E is in position 2 (allowed).

Therefore, “BEGUN” is a strong next guess.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R, B, U, N

Let’s pick a word that fits one of these patterns and uses fresh letters.  
A valid choice is “FEGID” (but that’s not a word).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting letters include S, T, R, N, L, etc., while common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. A good starting word should cover these letters efficiently.

Popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's widely considered one of the best starting words due to its combination of common consonants and vowels.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- T is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains an E, but not in position 5.
- The word does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

Next, we want a word that:
- Includes E (and not in position 5).
- Avoids S, L, A, T.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to test: R, N, C, H, M, P, B, F, G, K, etc.
Good vowels to test: I, O, U (since A is ruled out).

A strong next guess should cover new common letters. Let's try ""CRONE"":
- C, R, O, N, E
- E is in position 5 here, but we know E isn't in position 5 from SLATE, so this would test E in position 5 again, which isn't helpful. Let's choose ""CRIMP"" instead:
- C, R, I, M, P
- All new letters except E isn't tested here, but we want to test new consonants and vowels.

Wait, let's pick a word that definitely includes E in a different position. ""CHORE"" would put E in position 4, but H and O are good letters. However, ""CHORE"" has O which we haven't tested yet.

But ""CHORE"" has O which is a good vowel to test. However, we should prioritize consonants first. Let's try ""CRIMP"" which tests C, R, I, M, P - all new letters.

But let's pick a word that definitely includes E in a different position. ""CHORE"" puts E in position 4, which is new. Let's go with ""CHORE"".

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (x): S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R  
Letters confirmed in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: E (and E is NOT in position 5, because in SLATE it was in position 5 and marked “-”, and in CHORE it was in position 4 and still marked “-”).

So E must appear somewhere in positions 1–3.

Remaining common consonants that have not been tested yet: N, D, G, B, F, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (A and O are ruled out, E is already known to be present).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains E exactly once (because the feedback never said “E appears twice”).
- Places E in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.

A good candidate is “MIDGE”:
- Letters: M, I, D, G, E  
- E is in position 5 again, but that’s impossible because we already know E is NOT in position 5.  
So let’s swap E to position 3: “MIDGE” (but that’s not a valid English word).

Next candidate: “DINGE” – invalid.  
“BINGE” – valid word, E in position 5 again, so no.  
“PINE” – too short.  
“WIDGE” – invalid.  
“VINE” – too short.  
“NIGEL” – invalid (L is ruled out).  
“GIVEN” – E in position 5 again.  
“BEGUN” – E in position 2 (valid), letters: B, E, G, U, N – all untested except U (which is fine).  
This satisfies:
- Contains E (position 2).
- Uses only fresh letters (B, G, U, N).
- E is in position 2 (allowed).

Therefore, “BEGUN” is a strong next guess.

Letters confirmed in the word:  
E (fixed in position 2)  
G (must appear, but not in position 3 or 5)  
Therefore G must be in position 1 or 4.

So the pattern is:  
G E _ _ _   or   _ E G _

We need one more letter for each pattern, but we only have one blank left.  
That means the word must be exactly:  
G E _ _ _   with G in position 1 and E in position 2, and the remaining three letters must all be new (and none of the eliminated letters).

Remaining unused common letters: F, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Try W E G U T – U eliminated.  
Try W E G Y P – “WEGYP” (not valid).  

Try Y E G A N – A, N eliminated.  
Try Y E G I T – I eliminated.  
Try Y E G O T – O eliminated.  
Try Y E G U T – U eliminated.  
Try Y E G Y P – “YEGYP” (not valid).  

None of these combinations are valid English words.  
Let’s re-examine: the only remaining pattern is G E _ _ _ with G in position 1 and E in position 2, and we need three more letters.  
Try G E F F Y – “GEFFY” (not valid).  
Try G E P P Y – “GEPHY” (not valid).  
Try G E V I K – “GEVIK” (not valid).  
Try G E W Y F – “GEWYF” (not valid).  

Wait, the only valid word left that starts with G E and uses only fresh letters is “GEFFY” (invalid) and “GEVIF” (invalid).  
This suggests we may have missed a word earlier.  

Let’s list all valid 5-letter words that start with G E and use only letters not in the eliminated list:  
Available letters: F, K, P, V, W, Y  

Possible combinations:  
G E F _ _ – “GEFFY” (invalid)  
G E K _ _ – “GEKKS” (invalid)  
G E P _ _ – “GEPPY” (invalid)  
G E V _ _ – “GEVUP” (invalid)  
G E W _ _ – “GEWUV” (invalid)  
G E Y _ _ – “GEYKS” (invalid)  

None of these are valid.  
Let’s try the other pattern _ E G _ _ with G in position 4.  
Try F E G _ _ – “FEGGA” (invalid)  
Try K E G _ _ – “KEGGY” (invalid)  
Try P E G _ _ – “PEGGY” (invalid)  
Try V E G _ _ – “VEGGY” (invalid)  
Try W E G _ _ – “WEGGY” (invalid)  
Try Y E G _ _ – “YEGGA” (invalid)  

This is perplexing. Let’s list all valid 5-letter words that contain E in position 2 and G somewhere else, avoiding all eliminated letters.  

Valid words fitting _ E G _ _ or G E _ _ _ :  
- “KEGGY” – invalid (K, E, G, G, Y) – but G appears twice, and we only know G is present once.  
- “PEGGY” – invalid (P, E, G, G, Y) – G appears twice.  
- “VEGGY” – invalid (V, E, G, G, Y) – G appears twice.  
- “GEFFY” – invalid (G, E, F, F, Y) – no G in correct position.  
- “GEVIF” – invalid (G, E, V, I, F) – I is eliminated.  

The only valid word left is “KEGGY” (invalid) and “PEGGY” (invalid).  
This suggests we may have missed a word earlier.  

Let’s try “KEGGY” – even though G appears twice, the feedback only indicated G is in the word (not necessarily once).  
But “KEGGY” uses K, E, G, G, Y – all letters are allowed except G appears twice.  

Let’s try “KEGGY” – it’s the only valid word left that fits the pattern.  

Therefore, the next guess is “KEGGY”.

</think>

<guess>KEGGY</guess>",KEGGY,"From the five rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters NOT in the word:  
S, L, A, T, C, H, O, R, B, U, N, M, I, D  

Letters confirmed in the word:  
E (fixed in position 2)  
G (must appear, but not in position 3 or 5)  
Therefore G must be in position 1 or 4.

So the pattern is:  
G E _ _ _   or   _ E G _

We need one more letter for each pattern, but we only have one blank left.  
That means the word must be exactly:  
G E _ _ _   with G in position 1 and E in position 2, and the remaining three letters must all be new (and none of the eliminated letters).

Remaining unused common letters: F, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try G E F _ _  
The only valid 5-letter word that starts with GEF is “GEFFY” (not valid) or “GEFFS” (not valid).  
Try G E _ F _ – “GEPHY” (not valid).  
Try G E _ _ F – “GEVIF” (not valid).  
Try G E _ _ K – “GEVOK” (not valid).  
Try G E _ _ P – “GEVUP” (not valid).  
Try G E _ _ V – “GEWUV” (not valid).  
Try G E _ _ W – “GEVOW” (not valid).  
Try G E _ _ Y – “GEVOK” (not valid).  

None of these are valid English words.  
Let’s try the other pattern: _ E G _ _ with G in position 4.

We need letters for positions 1, 3, 5.  
Available letters: F, K, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Try F E G _ _ – “FEGGA” (not valid), “FEGGY” (not valid).  
Try K E G _ _ – “KEGGY” (not valid).  
Try P E G _ _ – “PEGGY” (not valid).  
Try V E G _ _ – “VEGGY” (not valid).  
Try W E G _ _ – “WEGGY” (not valid).  
Try Y E G _ _ – “YEGGA” (not valid).  

Still no valid word.  
Let’s try a different approach: the word must be _ E G _ _ with G in position 4, and the other letters must be unused.
