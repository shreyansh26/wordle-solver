For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. Common starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - but this has less consonant coverage
- AUDIO - similar issue

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because:
1. S is a very common starting letter
2. L is a common consonant
3. A is the most common vowel
4. T is a very common consonant
5. E is the most common ending letter

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Let’s summarize the information we have so far.

Letters we know are in the word:
- T is in position 1 (✓ from TRAMP and TACIT).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from TRAMP) and NOT in position 3 (from SLATE).  
  Therefore A must be in position 4 or 5.
- I is in the word and in position 4 (✓ from TACIT).

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
- S, L, E, R, M, P, C.

So the secret word looks like:
T _ _ I _

And it must contain A exactly once, and A must be in position 5 (since it cannot be in 2 or 3 and position 4 is already I).

Current pattern: T _ _ I A

We need two more letters (positions 2 and 3) that are not yet ruled out.  
Allowed letters (not yet excluded): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, N, K, etc.

We want common letters to maximize information.  
Let’s try a word that fits T _ _ I A and uses common remaining letters.  
Good candidates:
- TUBIA – but U and B are allowed, and I is already in place.
- THICK – but C is excluded.
- TIGIA – but G and second I would duplicate I, which might not be valid (words usually don’t repeat letters unless the secret word does).
- TONIA – O and N are allowed.
- TONIA seems reasonable.

Let’s verify:
- T(✓) position 1.
- O in position 2 (new letter).
- N in position 3 (new letter).
- I(✓) position 4.
- A in position 5 (forced by constraints).

No excluded letters are used, and it fits all feedback.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. Common starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - but this has less consonant coverage
- AUDIO - similar issue

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because:
1. S is a very common starting letter
2. L is a common consonant
3. A is the most common vowel
4. T is a very common consonant
5. E is the most common ending letter

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- L(x) → L is not in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and T somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain S, L, or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep A and T but move them to new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tried yet (like R, N, C, M, P, etc.).
3. Avoid S, L, and E.

A good candidate is “CRANK”:
- C, R, N, K are new letters.
- A moves to position 2 (was 3).
- T is not used here, but we can test T in another position later if needed.

However, since we know T is in the word, we should include it. Let’s try “TRAMP”:
- T is now in position 1 (was 4).
- A is now in position 2 (was 3).
- New letters: R, M, P.

This seems optimal as it tests T in a new position and introduces three new common letters.

<|im_start|>assistant
Current known facts:
- Letters present: T (position 1), A, M (somewhere, but not positions 3 and 4 respectively), P (somewhere, but not position 5).
- Letters absent: S, L, E, R, M, P (wait, no—M and P are in the word, just not in the positions guessed).

Wait, let me re-express the feedback clearly:

From TRAMP:
T(✓) – T is in position 1 (correct).
R(x) – R is not in the word.
A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
M(x) – M is not in the word.
P(x) – P is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Starts with T.
- Contains A, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain: S, L, E, R, M, P.

Remaining common letters to test: N, C, G, H, I, O, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with T, containing A (not in position 3), and avoiding the excluded letters.

Possible candidates:
- TACIT – but contains C and I, and A is in position 2 (allowed), but we haven’t tested C or I yet.
- TANKY – but Y is less common.
- TAWNY – but W is less common.
- TAHKI – but H and K are less common.
- TACIT seems the best so far.

Let’s verify:
- T is in position 1 (matches ✓).
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since it’s not in position 3).
- C and I are new letters to test.
- No excluded letters (S, L, E, R, M, P) are used.

Therefore, TACIT is a good next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. Common starting words include:

- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ROAST (R, O, A, S, T)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - but this has less consonant coverage
- AUDIO - similar issue

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because:
1. S is a very common starting letter
2. L is a common consonant
3. A is the most common vowel
4. T is a very common consonant
5. E is the most common ending letter

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- L(x) → L is not in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and T somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain S, L, or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep A and T but move them to new positions.
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tried yet (like R, N, C, M, P, etc.).
3. Avoid S, L, and E.

A good candidate is “CRANK”:
- C, R, N, K are new letters.
- A moves to position 2 (was 3).
- T is not used here, but we can test T in another position later if needed.

However, since we know T is in the word, we should include it. Let’s try “TRAMP”:
- T is now in position 1 (was 4).
- A is now in position 2 (was 3).
- New letters: R, M, P.

This seems optimal as it tests T in a new position and introduces three new common letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(-) E(x)
Guess 2: TRAMP -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(x) A(-) M(x) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current known facts:
- Letters present: T (position 1), A, M (somewhere, but not positions 3 and 4 respectively), P (somewhere, but not position 5).
- Letters absent: S, L, E, R, M, P (wait, no—M and P are in the word, just not in the positions guessed).

Wait, let me re-express the feedback clearly:

From TRAMP:
T(✓) – T is in position 1 (correct).
R(x) – R is not in the word.
A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 3.
M(x) – M is not in the word.
P(x) – P is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Starts with T.
- Contains A, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain: S, L, E, R, M, P.

Remaining common letters to test: N, C, G, H, I, O, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with T, containing A (not in position 3), and avoiding the excluded letters.

Possible candidates:
- TACIT – but contains C and I, and A is in position 2 (allowed), but we haven’t tested C or I yet.
- TANKY – but Y is less common.
- TAWNY – but W is less common.
- TAHKI – but H and K are less common.
- TACIT seems the best so far.

Let’s verify:
- T is in position 1 (matches ✓).
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since it’s not in position 3).
- C and I are new letters to test.
- No excluded letters (S, L, E, R, M, P) are used.

Therefore, TACIT is a good next guess.

Let’s summarize the information we have so far.

Letters we know are in the word:
- T is in position 1 (✓ from TRAMP and TACIT).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (from TRAMP) and NOT in position 3 (from SLATE).  
  Therefore A must be in position 4 or 5.
- I is in the word and in position 4 (✓ from TACIT).

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
- S, L, E, R, M, P, C.

So the secret word looks like:
T _ _ I _

And it must contain A exactly once, and A must be in position 5 (since it cannot be in 2 or 3 and position 4 is already I).

Current pattern: T _ _ I A

We need two more letters (positions 2 and 3) that are not yet ruled out.  
Allowed letters (not yet excluded): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, N, K, etc.

We want common letters to maximize information.  
Let’s try a word that fits T _ _ I A and uses common remaining letters.  
Good candidates:
- TUBIA – but U and B are allowed, and I is already in place.
- THICK – but C is excluded.
- TIGIA – but G and second I would duplicate I, which might not be valid (words usually don’t repeat letters unless the secret word does).
- TONIA – O and N are allowed.
- TONIA seems reasonable.

Let’s verify:
- T(✓) position 1.
- O in position 2 (new letter).
- N in position 3 (new letter).
- I(✓) position 4.
- A in position 5 (forced by constraints).

No excluded letters are used, and it fits all feedback.

Now we have:

Pattern so far:
T _ _ I A   (positions 1, 4, 5 are locked)

Letters still allowed (not yet excluded):
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two letters for positions 2 and 3 from the allowed set.  
We want common remaining consonants to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, N (but N is excluded), etc.

Let’s list possible combinations:
- T B F I A → TBFIA (invalid, not a word)
- T H I A → but position 3 is still open.
- T H I A is 4 letters; we need 5.
- T H I N A – N is excluded.
- T H I G A → THIGA (not a valid word)
- T H I K A → THIKA (not valid)
- T H I B A → THIBA (not valid)
- T H I D A → THIDA (not valid)
- T H I F A → THIFA (not valid)
- T H I V A → THIVA (not valid)

Let’s try common words that fit T _ _ I A:
- TUBIA – but U is allowed, B is allowed → TUBIA (valid word)
- TIGIA – but second I would duplicate, and I is already in 4
- TONIA – already tried
- TUBIA seems the only common word left that fits.

Check letters:
T(✓) position 1
U in position 2 (new)
B in position 3 (new)
I(✓) position 4
A(✓) position 5

No excluded letters used.  TUBIA is a valid 5-letter word.
