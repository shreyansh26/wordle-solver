### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum information about the letters in the secret word.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - also very common letters. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has a good mix of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words.

From the feedback:

Next, I want a word that keeps R in the 2nd position, includes E in one of the other positions, and avoids A, O, S. Also, I should introduce new common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain.

Possible candidates:
- ""TREND"" – T, N, D are new, keeps R in position 2, and places E in position 4.
- ""FRESH"" – F, X, H are new, but S is already ruled out.
- ""CHORE"" – C, H, O, but O is ruled out.
- ""BREAD"" – B, D, A, but A is ruled out.
- ""DRIED"" – D, I, E are new, keeps R in position 2, places E in position 5 (but feedback says E is not in 5th), so this is invalid.

- T(✓) → T is in the word and in the 1st position.
- R(✓) → R is in the word and in the 2nd position.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.
- D(x) → D is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: T R _ _ _
- Letters not in the word: A, O, S, N, D
- E must be in either position 4 or 5 (since it can't be in 3rd or 5th already? Wait, no: the first feedback said E was not in 5th, and the second feedback says E is not in 3rd. So E must be in 4th or 5th. But since E was not in 5th in the first guess, and not in 3rd in the second, E must be in 4th or 5th. But the second guess had E in 3rd and it was (-), so E is not in 3rd. The first guess had E in 5th and it was (-), so E is not in 5th. Therefore E must be in 4th position.

So the pattern is: T R _ E _

We need a 5-letter word that starts with TR and has E in 4th position. Possible letters for 3rd and 5th positions, avoiding A, O, S, N, D.

Possible letters for 3rd: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but need common letters)
Possible letters for 5th: same, but need to form a valid word.

Looking at common words starting with TR and having E in 4th:
- TREND was already guessed (and D is out)
- TRIPE (P in 5th, but P is okay)
- TRIKE (K in 5th, okay)
- TRIPE seems valid.

Let's check TRIPE:
- T R I P E
- Positions: 1=T, 2=R, 3=I, 4=E, 5=P
- This fits the pattern T R _ E _ and uses new letters I and P to gather more info.

Alternative: TRICE (C in 5th), but C is less common than P or K.

I'll go with TRIPE.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: T R _ _ _
- Letters not in the word: A, O, S, N, D, I, P
- E must be in position 4 or 5, but from Guess 1 and 3 we know:
  – In Guess 1, E was in position 5 and marked “-” (not in 5th).
  – In Guess 3, E was in position 5 and again marked “-”.
  Therefore, E **must** be in position 4.

So the word structure is: T R _ E _

Remaining letters to fill positions 3 and 5 must not be any of the eliminated letters (A, O, S, N, D, I, P).

Common remaining consonants: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Common vowels left: U (since A, O, E are out)

We need two distinct letters for positions 3 and 5 from the allowed set.

Possible combinations:
- TRB_E_ → TRBE_ (needs a 5th letter)
- TRC_E_ → TRCE_ (needs a 5th letter)

Let’s list valid English words matching T R _ E _:

1. TREND – already used (D eliminated)
2. TRIPE – already used (I, P eliminated)
3. TRIKE – already used (K in 5th, but K is allowed, but TRIKE is not in our pattern)
4. TRICE – already used (C in 5th, but C is allowed, but TRICE is not in our pattern)
5. TRUER – T R U E R (U in 3rd, R in 5th) – R is allowed (not eliminated)
6. TRUER – matches T R U E R, uses U and R, neither eliminated.

Check if TRUER is valid:
- T R U E R
- Positions: 1=T, 2=R, 3=U, 4=E, 5=R
- All letters are allowed (R not in eliminated list)
- It’s a valid English word.

Another option: TRUER vs. T R U E Y (TRUEY – not a valid word), T R U E K (TRUEK – invalid), etc.

TRUER seems the only common valid word left that fits the pattern and constraints.

Therefore, the next logical guess is TRUER.
