### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""SLATE"" is a strong choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down the possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- L(x) → L is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in the word and in the 3rd position (A _ _ _ _).
- T(x) → T is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ A _ _
- Letters to avoid: S, L, T
- Letters to include: A (fixed at 3), E (somewhere else)

Next, I need a word that:
1. Has A in the 3rd position.
2. Contains E somewhere (but not at the end).
3. Uses no S, L, T.

Let me think of words fitting _ _ A _ _ with E somewhere else. Some candidates:
- E A R T H – but T is excluded.
- R E A D Y – but D and Y might be too restrictive.
- C A R E E – but C and R are okay, but double E might be unlikely.
- P A R E D – D is okay, but R is repeated.
- B A R E N – N is okay, but B and R are new letters.
- F A R E E – F and R are okay, but double E.
- H A R E M – H and R are okay, but M is less common.

A good choice would be ""BARED"" but that has D at the end which is okay, but let me check:
- B A R E D: A is 3rd (✓), E is 4th (not 5th, ✓), no S, L, T. This seems valid.

Alternatively, ""CARED"":
- C A R E D: A is 3rd, E is 4th, no S, L, T. Also valid.

Between BARED and CARED, CARED uses C and R which are common, and D is acceptable. I'll go with CARED.

Let's digest the new feedback on CARED:

C(x) – C is NOT in the word.  
A(-) – A is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (it was 3rd in SLATE, so it must still be 3rd).  
R(x) – R is NOT in the word.  
E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (and we already knew it’s not 5th).  
D(-) – D is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ A _ _ (A locked in 3rd)
- Letters definitely in the word: A, E, D  
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, T, C, R  
- E must be in position 1 or 2 (since it can’t be 4 or 5).  
- D must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (since it can’t be 5).

Let’s list possible letters left: common consonants still available include B, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc. Vowels left: I, O, U.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in 3rd position
- E and D somewhere in 1,2,4 (but not 4 for E, not 5 for D)

Candidate structures:
1. E _ A _ _ (E in 1st)
2. _ E A _ _ (E in 2nd)
3. _ _ A D _ (D in 4th)
4. _ _ A _ D (D in 5th – invalid, so skip)

Let’s brainstorm:
- E _ A _ _ : e.g., EGADE? Not valid.  
- _ E A _ _ : e.g., BEA__? BEARD – but R is excluded.  
- _ _ A D _ : e.g., B A A D _? No.  
- _ _ A _ D: invalid (D can’t be 5th).

Wait, let’s think systematically:
- A is 3rd.
- E must be 1 or 2.
- D must be 1, 2, or 4.

Let’s try _ E A D _ – but D is 4th, which is allowed.  
We need a letter in 1st and 5th. Available letters: B, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:

  - A is 3rd (✓)  
  - E is 2nd (allowed)  
  - D is 4th (allowed)  
  - No S, L, T, C, R (✓)  
  - All letters are valid.  
BEADY seems valid.

Another: FEAST – but T is excluded.  
GEARD – R excluded.  
PEACH – C excluded.  
KEBAB – B is okay, but K and B are fine, but A is 3rd, E is 2nd, D is 5th – D can’t be 5th (from CARED feedback D was wrong in 5th).  
So BEADY is good.

Let’s confirm BEADY:
