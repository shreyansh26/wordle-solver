### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify vowels and consonants efficiently. A good starting word often contains multiple vowels and common consonants to maximize information gain. ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it includes:
- S, L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- No repeated letters, which helps test more unique letters

This should give me good coverage of the alphabet to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the new feedback on ROUND:

- D is NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Position 4 is T (fixed)
- Letters definitely absent: S, L, A, E, R, D
- Letters definitely present somewhere: O, U, N (but not in their guessed positions)

Positions:
1 2 3 4 5
? ? ? T ?

Constraints:
- 1,2,3,5 can be any letters except S,L,A,E,R,D
- O, U, N must appear at least once, but not in positions 2,3,4 respectively.

I need a 5-letter word with T in position 4, using only the remaining letters (B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus U, O, N), and ensuring O, U, N appear at least once (but not in the forbidden spots).

Possible letters for positions:

- Place N in position 1 (allowed)
- Place O in position 3 (allowed)
- Place U in position 5 (allowed)
- Position 2 can be any remaining letter; I’ll use M (common consonant)

This gives: N M O T U → ""NMO TU"" – but that’s not a valid word. Need to rearrange to form a real word.

Try ""POINT"":
- P O I N T
- Position 4 is T (good)
- Contains O, I, N, P
- Letters: P (new), O (allowed in position 2), I (new), N (allowed in position 3), T (fixed)
- Check forbidden positions:
  - O was in position 2 in ROUND, and feedback said O is NOT in position 2 (-). So O cannot be in position 2 here. Thus ""POINT"" is invalid because O would be in position 2.

Next try ""NOITC"" – invalid (not a word).

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify vowels and consonants efficiently. A good starting word often contains multiple vowels and common consonants to maximize information gain. ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it includes:
- S, L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- No repeated letters, which helps test more unique letters

This should give me good coverage of the alphabet to start narrowing down possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- T is in the word and in the 4th position (✓)
- E is NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- The word has T in the 4th position.
- The word does NOT contain S, L, A, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has T as its 4th letter: _ _ _ T _
2. Does NOT contain S, L, A, E
3. Uses other common consonants and vowels to test more letters

Good remaining common consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U

I’ll try a word that includes some of these. ""ROUND"" is a good candidate because:
- R, O, U, N, D are all new letters
- T is in the 4th position (matches requirement)
- Avoids S, L, A, E

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(-) U(-) N(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ROUND:

- R is NOT in the word (x)
- O is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (-)
- U is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (-)
- N is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (-)  ← Wait, the 4th position in ROUND is N, but we already know T is in the 4th position in the secret word. This means N cannot be in the 4th position, so the feedback “N(-)” simply tells us N is somewhere else.
- D is NOT in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Position 4 is T (fixed)
- Letters definitely absent: S, L, A, E, R, D
- Letters definitely present somewhere: O, U, N (but not in their guessed positions)

Positions:
1 2 3 4 5
? ? ? T ?

Constraints:
- 1,2,3,5 can be any letters except S,L,A,E,R,D
- O, U, N must appear at least once, but not in positions 2,3,4 respectively.

I need a 5-letter word with T in position 4, using only the remaining letters (B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus U, O, N), and ensuring O, U, N appear at least once (but not in the forbidden spots).

Possible letters for positions:
1,2,3,5: {B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, U}

I want to test new letters while placing O, U, N in allowed positions. Let’s try:

- Place N in position 1 (allowed)
- Place O in position 3 (allowed)
- Place U in position 5 (allowed)
- Position 2 can be any remaining letter; I’ll use M (common consonant)

This gives: N M O T U → ""NMO TU"" – but that’s not a valid word. Need to rearrange to form a real word.

Try ""POINT"":
- P O I N T
- Position 4 is T (good)
- Contains O, I, N, P
- Letters: P (new), O (allowed in position 2), I (new), N (allowed in position 3), T (fixed)
- Check forbidden positions:
  - O was in position 2 in ROUND, and feedback said O is NOT in position 2 (-). So O cannot be in position 2 here. Thus ""POINT"" is invalid because O would be in position 2.

Next try ""NOITC"" – invalid (not a word).

Try ""TONIC"":
- T O N I C
- Position 4 is T (good)
- Contains O, N, I, C
- O is in position 2 – again forbidden by ROUND feedback.

Try ""CONUT"" – invalid.

Try ""MOUNT"":
- M O U N T
- Position 4 is T (good)
- Contains M, O, U, N
- O is in position 2 – forbidden.

Try ""JUNCT"":
- J U N C T
- Position 4 is T (good)
- Contains J, U, N, C
- U is in position 2 – allowed (feedback only said U is not in position 3)
- N is in position 3 – allowed (feedback only said N is not in position 4)
- C is new
- J is new
- This is a valid word and tests new letters.

But ""JUNCT"" is less common; let’s pick a more common word.

Try ""CLOUD"" – but D is forbidden.

Try ""FOUNT"":
- F O U N T
- Position 4 is T (good)
- Contains F, O, U, N
- O is in position 2 – forbidden.

Try ""HOUND"":
- H O U N D
- D is forbidden.

Try ""POINT"" already ruled out.

Try ""MOUNT"" ruled out.

Try ""GROUT"" – but R is forbidden.

Try ""POUTY"" – but Y is allowed, but word is uncommon.

Try ""WOUND"" – D forbidden.

Try ""CUTTY"" – but T is repeated, and Y is allowed.

Actually, let’s try ""CUTIE"" – but E is forbidden.

Try ""CUTIN"":
- C U T I N
- Position 4 is T (good)
- Contains C, U, I, N
- U is in position 2 – allowed (only position 3 was forbidden for U)
- N is in position 5 – allowed
- C and I are new letters
- This is a valid word.

But ""CUTIN"" is a bit technical; let’s pick a more common word.

Try ""COUNT"":
- C O U N T
- Position 4 is T (good)
- Contains C, O, U, N
- O is in position 2 – forbidden.

Try ""CUPID"" – D forbidden.

Try ""CUPON"" – N is allowed, but O is in position 2 – forbidden.

Try ""CUTIE"" – E forbidden.

Try ""CUTIE"" is invalid.

Try ""CUTIN"" seems best among these.

But let’s try ""FOUNT"" – O in position 2 forbidden.

Try ""GOUNT"" – invalid.

Try ""PINTO"":
- P I N T O
- Position 4 is T (good)
- Contains P, I, N, O
- O is in position 5 – allowed (was only forbidden in position 2)
- N is in position 3 – allowed
- P and I are new
- This is a valid word.

""PINTO"" is common and fits all constraints.

Let’s go with ""PINTO"".
