### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover these letters without repeating any, to quickly narrow down possibilities.

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (focuses on vowels)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it includes common consonants and vowels, helping to identify which letters are present in the secret word.

All five letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are not in the secret word.  
That means the secret word contains none of C, R, A, N, or E.  
We now need a 5-letter word that uses entirely different letters.

Good letters to try next (since they weren’t used yet) include common consonants like S, T, L, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, F, V, W, Y, Z, and vowels like I, O, U (since A and E are ruled out).

A balanced word that covers several new common letters is “STOIC”.  
Letters: S, T, O, I, C — but C was already ruled out.

Current known facts:

1. Pattern so far: S L O _ H
2. Letters already ruled out: C, R, A, N, E, I, M, Y, T
3. We need the 4th letter to be any letter that is NOT in the banned list.

Remaining common letters that fit: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z, U (but U hasn’t been tested yet).

Looking for 5-letter words that fit S L O _ H:

- SLOSH – S is already used in position 1, so SLOSH would have S in position 4, which is allowed. But H is already in position 5, so this would be S L O S H. However, we don’t know if S is allowed in position 4. The feedback only told us S is in position 1, not necessarily that S isn’t elsewhere.

- SLOKH – Not a valid English word.

- SLOGH – Not a valid English word.

- SLOPH – P hasn’t been ruled out yet. SLOPH is a valid word (meaning the residue left after soaking).

- SLOSH (again) – valid word.

Between SLOPH and SLOSH, both are valid. SLOPH uses P, which is untested. SLOSH uses S again, which is already confirmed in position 1 but we have no info against it appearing again. However, SLOSH is more common. I’ll go with SLOSH first.

Wait, let me double-check: SLOSH is indeed a valid word meaning the foam or residue from washing. It fits the pattern S L O _ H with S in position 4. Since S hasn’t been ruled out for positions other than 1, this is acceptable.

But looking back at the feedback, the only letters ruled out are C, R, A, N, E, I, M, Y, T. S, L, O, H have all been confirmed in their positions. The 4th letter hasn’t been tested yet. S is allowed in position 4, so SLOSH is possible.

However, SLOSH has S in position 4, which might be acceptable. Alternatively, SLOPH uses P in position 4. Both are valid, but SLOPH is more likely to be the intended word. I’ll go with SLOPH.

Wait, no, SLOSH is actually more common. Let me verify: SLOSH is definitely a valid word. I’ll proceed with SLOSH.
