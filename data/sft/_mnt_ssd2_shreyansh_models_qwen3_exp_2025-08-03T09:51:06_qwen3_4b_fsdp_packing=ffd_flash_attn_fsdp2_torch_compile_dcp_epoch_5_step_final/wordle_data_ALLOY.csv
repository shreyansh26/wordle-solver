### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help us eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Good starting words often include common vowels and consonants like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

Some popular first guesses are:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- RAISE
- ARISE
- STARE

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should give us good coverage for the first guess.

Another candidate could be “ACTOR” or “ADMIT”, but “ABOUT” tests O and U which are useful vowels.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help us eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Good starting words often include common vowels and consonants like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

Some popular first guesses are:
- SLATE
- CRANE
- RAISE
- ARISE
- STARE

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should give us good coverage for the first guess.

We know:
- A is in the word and is in the first position.
- R, I, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the word looks like: A _ _ _ _

We need to pick a second guess that:
1. Keeps A in the first position.
2. Uses letters we haven’t tested yet.
3. Tests as many new common letters as possible.

Letters not yet used: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.
Good remaining vowels: O, U.

Let’s try a word that puts A first and tests several new common letters. A common pattern is A + consonant + vowel + consonant + consonant.

A good candidate is “ABOUT”:
- A (✓) stays in position 1.
- B, O, U, T are all new letters.

Another candidate could be “ACTOR” or “ADMIT”, but “ABOUT” tests O and U which are useful vowels.

I’ll go with “ABOUT” as it tests three new vowels (O, U) and a common consonant T.

Remaining unused common letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Begins with A.
2. Contains O somewhere other than position 3.
3. Uses only the remaining letters.
4. Tests as many new letters as possible.

Possible positions for O: 2, 4, or 5.

Let’s try to place O in position 2: A O _ _ _
We need two more letters. Good remaining consonants: C, D, L, M, N, P, V, W.

A word like “ACORN” comes to mind:
- A (position 1) ✓
- C (position 2) – new letter
- O (position 3) – but we know O cannot be in position 3 (from ABOUT feedback). So ACORN is invalid.

Next, place O in position 4: A _ _ O _
Possible letters for positions 2 and 3: remaining consonants and vowels.
A good candidate is “AMMON” – but N is repeated and we don’t know if N is allowed.
Another candidate is “ADMON” – D and M and N are new letters.

Check “ADMON”:
- A (✓) position 1
- D (new) position 2
- M (new) position 3
- O (must be in word, placed in position 4 ✓)
- N (new) position 5
Letters used: A, D, M, O, N – none of R, I, S, E, B, U, T, ✓

This seems valid and tests 4 new letters (D, M, O, N).

Another candidate is “ALMON” – but L is also new, and it’s similar.

I’ll go with “ADMON” as the next guess.

<guess>ALLOY</guess>",ALLOY,"Current constraints:
1. Word pattern: A L O _ _  (positions 1,3,4 are fixed as A, L, O)
2. Letters already ruled out: R, I, S, E, B, U, T, D, M, N, G, W
3. Remaining usable letters: C, F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z (plus any others not yet used)
4. We need two more letters for positions 2 and 5, chosen only from the allowed set.

Looking at common 5-letter words that fit A L O _ _:
- ALONE – but N is already ruled out
- ALOUD – U and D are ruled out
- ALLOY – Y and second L are allowed, but double L might be less informative
- ALOOF – O is already used in position 4
- ALOHA – H is allowed, but A is already used
- ALOFT – T is ruled out
- ALOPS – S is ruled out
- ALOYS – S is ruled out

The only remaining plausible word that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters is ""ALLOY"":
- A (1), L (2), O (3), L (4), Y (5)
- Letters used: A, L, O, Y – all allowed
- It tests the new letter Y in position 5.

Therefore, ""ALLOY"" is the logical next guess.",Guess 5: ALLOY -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) L(✓) L(✓) O(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
