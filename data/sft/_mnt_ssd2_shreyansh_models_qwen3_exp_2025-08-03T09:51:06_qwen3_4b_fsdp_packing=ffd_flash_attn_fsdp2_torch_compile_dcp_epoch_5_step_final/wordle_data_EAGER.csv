For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in English words. Common letters in 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

A popular starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good mix of common letters and positions to test. However, another strong candidate is ""AROSE"" which uses all five most common letters (A, R, O, S, E). 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers more common letters and vowels, giving us maximum information about the secret word's composition.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-)  – A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word
- S(x) – S is NOT in the word
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
Letters definitely in the word: A, R, E  
Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S  
Positions to avoid for these letters:
- A cannot be in position 1
- R cannot be in position 2
- E cannot be in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that contains A, R, E and does NOT contain O or S.  
Good candidates should place A, R, E in new positions and fill the remaining two spots with letters not yet ruled out.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s try to form a word that uses A, R, E plus two new consonants.  
A common pattern is to keep the vowels but rearrange them.  
A word like “TREAD” contains T, R, E, A, D – but we already know E is in the word and D hasn’t been tested. However, “TREAD” has E in position 2, which is allowed since E only cannot be in position 5.  
But let’s check:  
T R E A D – positions: E is in 3, which is fine.  
But we need to test new letters. Another word is “RAISE” – but S is ruled out.  
“EARLY” – uses E, A, R, L, Y – but Y is sometimes a vowel.  
“REACT” – uses R, E, A, C, T – all new letters except A, R, E.  
This seems good because it places A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed), E in position 3 (allowed), and introduces C and T.  

Let’s go with “REACT”.

- R cannot be in position 2
- E cannot be in position 5

We need a 5-letter word that contains A, R, E and does NOT contain O or S.  
Good candidates should place A, R, E in new positions and fill the remaining two spots with letters not yet ruled out.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s try to form a word that uses A, R, E plus two new consonants.  
A common pattern is to keep the vowels but rearrange them.  
A word like “TREAD” contains T, R, E, A, D – but we already know E is in the word and D hasn’t been tested. However, “TREAD” has E in position 2, which is allowed since E only cannot be in position 5.  
But let’s check:  
T R E A D – positions: E is in 3, which is fine.  
But we need to test new letters. Another word is “RAISE” – but S is ruled out.  
“EARLY” – uses E, A, R, L, Y – but Y is sometimes a vowel.  
“REACT” – uses R, E, A, C, T – all new letters except A, R, E.  
This seems good because it places A in position 2 (allowed), R in position 1 (allowed), E in position 3 (allowed), and introduces C and T.  

Let’s go with “REACT”.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that ARE in the word: A, R, E  
   (Each has appeared in every position except one so far.)

2. Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S, C, T

3. Position restrictions:
   - A cannot be in positions 1 or 3
   - R cannot be in positions 2 or 1
   - E cannot be in positions 2 or 5

4. We still need two more distinct letters to fill the remaining two slots.  
   Available letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Contains exactly the letters A, R, E in some arrangement
- Does NOT contain O, S, C, T
- Places A, R, E in positions not yet ruled out
- Uses two new letters from the available pool

Let’s try to place A, R, E in allowed positions and pick two fresh consonants.  
A common pattern is to try to form a word like “DRAPE” or “GRAPE” but those use P which we haven’t tried.  
Another candidate: “RADGE” – but G and D are new and fit the constraints.  
But “RADGE” isn’t a valid English word.  
Next: “EAGER” – but E appears twice, and we don’t know if the secret word has double letters.  
“EARLY” – uses Y which is allowed, but L hasn’t been tested and Y hasn’t been tested.  
“EARLY” also puts E in position 1 (allowed), A in 2 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed), L in 4, Y in 5.  
This seems valid and introduces two new letters (L, Y).

Let’s go with “EARLY”.

From the feedback so far:

1. Letters confirmed in the word:
   - E in position 1 (✓)
   - A in position 2 (✓)
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)

2. Letters confirmed NOT in the word:
   - O, S, C, T, L, Y

3. Positions already ruled out for R:
   - Position 2 (from REACT)
   - Position 3 (from EARLY)
   - Position 1 (from EARLY, since R is not in position 1 because E is in position 1 and R is not in position 1)
   Therefore R must be in position 4 or 5.

4. Remaining letters we have not tested yet:
   B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that starts with ""EA"" and has R in either position 4 or 5, plus two more letters from the remaining pool.

Possible patterns:
- EA _ R _
- EA _ _ R

Let's list possible words:
- EAGER (but G hasn't been tested, and this would put R in position 4)
- EARTH (T is ruled out)
- EAGER is valid, uses G which is new
- EARDV (not a word)
- EABIR (not a word)
- EADIR (not a word)
- EABER (not a word)
- EAFIR (not a word)
- EAGIR (not a word)
- EAHIR (not a word)
- EAJIR (not a word)
- EAKIR (not a word)
- EAMIR (not a word)
- EAPIR (not a word)
- EAQIR (not a word)
- EASIR (S is ruled out)
- EAVIR (not a word)
- EAWIR (not a word)
- EAXIR (not a word)
- EAZIR (not a word)

The only valid word I can think of is EAGER, which fits all constraints:
- Starts with EA
- R in position 4
- Uses G (new letter)
- No disallowed letters

Therefore, the next guess is EAGER.
