For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the new feedback on POINT:
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- I(-) – I is in the word but in the wrong position.
- N(-) – N is in the word but in the wrong position.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ O _ _ _.
- It contains the letters I and N, but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 respectively (since they were in positions 3 and 4 in POINT and marked wrong position).
- It does NOT contain A, R, S, E, P, or T.

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus I and N which we know are in the word).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with any letter except O (position 1).
2. Has O in position 2.
3. Contains both I and N, but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since they were in positions 3 and 4 in POINT and marked wrong position).
4. Uses only allowed letters.

Possible positions for I and N:
- I could be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- N could be in position 1, 3, or 4.

But since positions 1 and 2 are still open, let’s look for words with _ O _ _ _ and include I and N in valid spots.

A quick scan of common words fitting _ O _ _ _ with I and N:
- ""NOISE"" – but has E (disallowed).
- ""ONION"" – has N in position 5 (allowed) and I in position 4 (allowed).
- ""OPIUM"" – has P (disallowed).
- ""OVINE"" – has E (disallowed).
- ""OZONE"" – has E (disallowed).
- ""OFTEN"" – has E (disallowed).
- ""OFTIN"" – not a valid word.
- ""OPIUM"" – P is disallowed.
- ""ONION"" seems valid: O N I O N, but has O twice (allowed) and positions:
  - O in position 2 (correct).
  - N in position 1 (allowed, since it was in position 4 before).
  - I in position 3 (but in POINT, I was in position 3 and marked wrong position, so position 3 is invalid for I).
  Wait, in POINT, I was in position 3 and marked wrong position, so I cannot be in position 3. Similarly, N in position 4 was marked wrong, so N cannot be in position 4.

So ""ONION"" has I in position 3 – invalid.

Next candidate: ""OCTIN"" – not a valid word.
""OUIJA"" – has A (disallowed) and J (allowed), but A is disallowed.
""OPIUM"" – P is disallowed.
""OVINE"" – E is disallowed.
""OFTEN"" – E is disallowed.
""OFTIN"" – not valid.
""ONION"" – invalid as above.

Let me think of other words:
- ""OFTEN"" – E disallowed.
- ""OFTIN"" – not valid.
- ""OFTLY"" – has L and Y, but I is missing.
- ""OFTEN"" – E disallowed.
- ""OFTIN"" – not valid.
- ""OFTLY"" – no I.
- ""OFTEN"" – E disallowed.

Wait, we need I and N in the word. Let’s list possible positions:
- I can be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- N can be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Possible combinations:
1. I in 1, N in 3: I O N _ _
2. I in 1, N in 4: I O _ N _
3. I in 1, N in 5: I O _ _ N
4. I in 4, N in 3: _ O N I _
5. I in 4, N in 1: N O _ I _
6. I in 5, N in 3: _ O N _ I
7. I in 5, N in 1: N O _ _ I
8. I in 5, N in 4: _ O _ N I

Now let’s find valid words for these patterns:
1. I O N _ _: ""IONIC"" – has C (allowed), but C is new. But ""IONIC"" has I O N I C – positions: I in 1 (valid), O in 2 (correct), N in 3 (valid, since N was in 4 before), I in 4 (valid), C in 5. This seems valid.
2. I O _ N _: ""IONIC"" – same as above, but N is in 4.
3. I O _ _ N: ""IONIC"" – N in 5.
4. _ O N I _: ""ONION"" – but I is in 3 (invalid).
5. N O _ I _: ""NOXIA"" – has A (disallowed).
6. _ O N _ I: ""CONIC"" – has C (allowed), but N in 3 (valid), I in 5 (valid).
7. N O _ _ I: ""NOVIA"" – has A (disallowed).
8. _ O _ N I: ""CONIC"" – same as 6.

""IONIC"" fits pattern 1: I O N _ _ and seems valid. Let’s check:
- I O N I C:
  - I in 1 (valid, since in POINT it was in 3 and marked wrong position).
  - O in 2 (correct).
  - N in 3 (valid, since in POINT it was in 4 and marked wrong position).
  - I in 4 (valid, since in POINT it was in 3 and marked wrong position).
  - C in 5 (new, allowed).

This seems like a good next guess to test positions for I and N and introduce C.

Alternative: ""IONIC"" is valid, but let me check if ""IONIC"" is actually a word – yes, it is.

Another option: ""ONION"" is invalid because I would be in position 3 (already ruled out).
""IONIC"" seems the best fit.

Thus, the next guess is ""IONIC"".
</think>

<guess>IONIC</guess>",IONIC,"From the new feedback on POINT:
- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- I(-) – I is in the word but in the wrong position.
- N(-) – N is in the word but in the wrong position.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ O _ _ _.
- It contains the letters I and N, but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 respectively (since they were in positions 3 and 4 in POINT and marked wrong position).
- It does NOT contain A, R, S, E, P, or T.

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus I and N which we know are in the word).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with any letter except O (position 1).
2. Has O in position 2.
3. Contains both I and N, but not in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since they were in positions 3 and 4 in POINT and marked wrong position).
4. Uses only allowed letters.

Possible positions for I and N:
- I could be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- N could be in position 1, 3, or 4.

But since positions 1 and 2 are still open, let’s look for words with _ O _ _ _ and include I and N in valid spots.

A quick scan of common words fitting _ O _ _ _ with I and N:
- ""NOISE"" – but has E (disallowed).
- ""ONION"" – has N in position 5 (allowed) and I in position 4 (allowed).
- ""OPIUM"" – has P (disallowed).
- ""OVINE"" – has E (disallowed).
- ""OZONE"" – has E (disallowed).
- ""OFTEN"" – has E (disallowed).
- ""OFTIN"" – not a valid word.
- ""OPIUM"" – P is disallowed.
- ""ONION"" seems valid: O N I O N, but has O twice (allowed) and positions:
  - O in position 2 (correct).
  - N in position 1 (allowed, since it was in position 4 before).
  - I in position 3 (but in POINT, I was in position 3 and marked wrong position, so position 3 is invalid for I).
  Wait, in POINT, I was in position 3 and marked wrong position, so I cannot be in position 3. Similarly, N in position 4 was marked wrong, so N cannot be in position 4.

So ""ONION"" has I in position 3 – invalid.

Next candidate: ""OCTIN"" – not a valid word.
""OUIJA"" – has A (disallowed) and J (allowed), but A is disallowed.
""OPIUM"" – P is disallowed.
""OVINE"" – E is disallowed.
""OFTEN"" – E is disallowed.
""OFTIN"" – not valid.
""ONION"" – invalid as above.

Let me think of other words:
- ""OFTEN"" – E disallowed.
- ""OFTIN"" – not valid.
- ""OFTLY"" – has L and Y, but I is missing.
- ""OFTEN"" – E disallowed.
- ""OFTIN"" – not valid.
- ""OFTLY"" – no I.
- ""OFTEN"" – E disallowed.

Wait, we need I and N in the word. Let’s list possible positions:
- I can be in position 1, 4, or 5.
- N can be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Possible combinations:
1. I in 1, N in 3: I O N _ _
2. I in 1, N in 4: I O _ N _
3. I in 1, N in 5: I O _ _ N
4. I in 4, N in 3: _ O N I _
5. I in 4, N in 1: N O _ I _
6. I in 5, N in 3: _ O N _ I
7. I in 5, N in 1: N O _ _ I
8. I in 5, N in 4: _ O _ N I

Now let’s find valid words for these patterns:
1. I O N _ _: ""IONIC"" – has C (allowed), but C is new. But ""IONIC"" has I O N I C – positions: I in 1 (valid), O in 2 (correct), N in 3 (valid, since N was in 4 before), I in 4 (valid), C in 5. This seems valid.
2. I O _ N _: ""IONIC"" – same as above, but N is in 4.
3. I O _ _ N: ""IONIC"" – N in 5.
4. _ O N I _: ""ONION"" – but I is in 3 (invalid).
5. N O _ I _: ""NOXIA"" – has A (disallowed).
6. _ O N _ I: ""CONIC"" – has C (allowed), but N in 3 (valid), I in 5 (valid).
7. N O _ _ I: ""NOVIA"" – has A (disallowed).
8. _ O _ N I: ""CONIC"" – same as 6.

""IONIC"" fits pattern 1: I O N _ _ and seems valid. Let’s check:
- I O N I C:
  - I in 1 (valid, since in POINT it was in 3 and marked wrong position).
  - O in 2 (correct).
  - N in 3 (valid, since in POINT it was in 4 and marked wrong position).
  - I in 4 (valid, since in POINT it was in 3 and marked wrong position).
  - C in 5 (new, allowed).

This seems like a good next guess to test positions for I and N and introduce C.

Alternative: ""IONIC"" is valid, but let me check if ""IONIC"" is actually a word – yes, it is.

Another option: ""ONION"" is invalid because I would be in position 3 (already ruled out).
""IONIC"" seems the best fit.

Thus, the next guess is ""IONIC"".",Guess 3: IONIC -> FEEDBACK: I(✓) O(✓) N(✓) I(✓) C(✓),SUCCESS
