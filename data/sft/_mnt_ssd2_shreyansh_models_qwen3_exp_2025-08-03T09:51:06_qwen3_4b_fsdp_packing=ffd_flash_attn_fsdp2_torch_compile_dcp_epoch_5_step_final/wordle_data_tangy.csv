For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should cover a mix of these letters without repeating any.

Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", ""RAISE"", etc. These words include common consonants and vowels. Let's go with ""RAISE"" as it covers R, A, I, S, E - all very common letters in 5-letter words.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) — so A is the 2nd letter.
- I, S, E are not in the word (x).

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S, E
- Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has A as the 2nd letter.
2. Does not contain R, I, S, E.
3. Contains letters from the remaining pool.

Good candidates:
- BANAL (but contains A twice, which we already know is correct once)
- CAMPS
- CANDY

- MADAM
- TALON

Let's pick ""CANDY"":
- C A N D Y
- A is in position 2 (correct)
