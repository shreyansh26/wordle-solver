### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 of these common letters to maximize information gain. Some good options are:
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- TRAIN (T, R, A, I, N)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it includes C, R, A, N, E - covering several very common letters and can help narrow down vowels and consonants quickly.

- It introduces V, P, I, D which are common and untested.

From the new feedback on VAPID:
- V(x) → V is NOT in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
- P(x) → P is NOT in the word.
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word.
- D(-) → D is in the word but in the wrong position.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, S, T, O, L, V, P, I.
- Letters definitely IN the word:
  – A is in position 2.
  – D is in the word but NOT in position 5.

We still need to test new common letters that haven’t been ruled out:
- Untested vowels: U, Y (Y can act as vowel)
- Untested consonants: B, F, G, H, K, M, Q, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A fixed in position 2.
- Must contain D (but not in position 5).
- Can only use letters from the remaining pool.

Possible positions:
- 1: B, F, G, H, K, M, W, Y
- 2: A (fixed)
- 3: any remaining letter (but D could go here)
- 4: any remaining letter
- 5: any remaining letter except D (since D is not in position 5)

Let’s brainstorm:
- M A D _ _ → MAD is prefix, but we need 5 letters. MADAM uses A twice, but we don’t know if A repeats.
- B A D _ _ → BADGE uses G and E (E is ruled out).
- H A D _ _ → HADDO uses D twice and O (ruled out).
- G A D _ _ → GADID uses I (ruled out).
- F A D _ _ → FADIS uses I (ruled out).
- K A D _ _ → KADID uses I (ruled out).
- W A D _ _ → WADIS uses I (ruled out).
- Y A D _ _ → YADIS uses I (ruled out).

None of these are working. Let’s try D not in position 3:
- _ A D _ _ → need D in position 3, but D can’t be in position 5.
- _ A _ D _ → D in position 4
- _ A _ _ D → D in position 5 (ruled out)

Let’s try D in position 4:
- _ A _ D _ → need 1st and 3rd letters from remaining pool.

Possible combinations:
- B A F D _ → BAFD_ – need last letter. BAFDI uses I (ruled out).
- G A M D _ → GAMDA – not a word.
- H A M D _ → HAMDA – not a word.
- M A G D _ → MAGDA – not a word.
- F A G D _ → FAGDA – not a word.
- H A G D _ → HAGDA – not a word.
- K A G D _ → KAGDA – not a word.
- M A G D _ → MAGDA – not a word.

Let’s try D in position 3:
- _ A D _ _ → need 1st and 4th letters from remaining pool.

Possible:
- B A D G _ → BADGE uses E (ruled out).
- F A D G _ → FADGE uses E (ruled out).
- G A D G _ → GADGE – not a word.
- H A D G _ → HADGE – not a word.
- K A D G _ → KADG_ – not a word.
- M A D G _ → MADGE – uses E (ruled out).
- W A D G _ → WADG_ – not a word.

Let’s try other vowels: U
- _ A _ _ _ with U somewhere.

Possible:
- B A U D _ → BAUD_ – BAUD_ words: BAUDY, BAUDR (R is ruled out), BAUDL (L ruled out), BAUDS (S ruled out). BAUDY uses Y which is allowed.
- F A U D _ → FAUD_ – FAUDY
- G A U D _ → GAUD_ – GAUDY
- H A U D _ → HAUD_ – HAUDY (not common)
- M A U D _ → MAUD_ – MAUDY
- W A U D _ → WAUD_ – WAUDY (not common)

GAUDY is a valid 5-letter word that fits:
- G, A, U, D, Y
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- D is in position 4 (not 5, so okay)
- All letters are from remaining pool.
