For the first guess, the goal is to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are present or absent. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word and narrowing down possibilities efficiently.

However, another strong alternative is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - covering very common letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better vowel coverage.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it is not in position 1).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but not in the first position.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep the A but move it to a different position (positions 2-5).
2. Introduce new letters that are common and not yet ruled out (since R, O, S, E are out, good candidates are T, N, L, C, D, etc.).
3. Try to cover other common consonants and vowels.

A good candidate is ""TALON"":
- T: new, common consonant
- A: confirmed in word, now in position 2
- L: new, common consonant
- O: already ruled out (x), so skip
- N: new, common consonant

But ""TALON"" has O which is ruled out. Let's try ""TANKS"":
- T, N, K, S (S is ruled out), so no.

Next idea: ""MANTA"":
- M, A (now in position 2), N, T (new), A (again). But A is already known to be in word, and we have two A's.

Better: ""TACIT"":
- T, A (position 2), C, I, T. But C and I are new, and T is repeated.

Another: ""LADLE"":
- L, A (position 2), D, L, E (E is ruled out).

Best so far: ""TALIA"":
- T, A (position 2), L, I, A. But A is already known, and we have two A's.

Let's try ""TALON"" again - even though O is ruled out, it's a good consonant set. But O is out, so skip.

Next: ""CANTO"" - O is out.

""TAMAL"" - A in position 2, T, M, A, L. But A is repeated.

""TABBY"" - B is new, but Y is less common.

""TALON"" is the best among these, but O is ruled out. So we need another word.

""PLANT"":
- P, L, A (position 2), N, T. No ruled-out letters except O, S, R, E, so this is safe.

This seems good: P, L, A (position 2), N, T.

3. Still untested common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

- Contains the letter A exactly once (since it already appeared once in AROSE and wasn’t in position 1, and again in PLANT and wasn’t in position 3, so it must appear at 2, 4 or 5).
- Uses only letters that have not yet been ruled out.
- Uses common remaining letters to maximize information.

2. Introduce new letters that are common and not yet ruled out (since R, O, S, E are out, good candidates are T, N, L, C, D, etc.).
3. Try to cover other common consonants and vowels.

A good candidate is ""TALON"":
- T: new, common consonant
- A: confirmed in word, now in position 2
- L: new, common consonant
- O: already ruled out (x), so skip
- N: new, common consonant

But ""TALON"" has O which is ruled out. Let's try ""TANKS"":
- T, N, K, S (S is ruled out), so no.

Next idea: ""MANTA"":
- M, A (now in position 2), N, T (new), A (again). But A is already known to be in word, and we have two A's.

Better: ""TACIT"":
- T, A (position 2), C, I, T. But C and I are new, and T is repeated.

Another: ""LADLE"":
- L, A (position 2), D, L, E (E is ruled out).

Best so far: ""TALIA"":
- T, A (position 2), L, I, A. But A is already known, and we have two A's.

Let's try ""TALON"" again - even though O is ruled out, it's a good consonant set. But O is out, so skip.

Next: ""CANTO"" - O is out.

""TAMAL"" - A in position 2, T, M, A, L. But A is repeated.

""TABBY"" - B is new, but Y is less common.

""TALON"" is the best among these, but O is ruled out. So we need another word.

""PLANT"":
- P, L, A (position 2), N, T. No ruled-out letters except O, S, R, E, so this is safe.

This seems good: P, L, A (position 2), N, T.

We need a 5-letter word that:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

C is in position 1 (allowed), A is in position 2 (confirmed), B and Y are new.

Another candidate: ""CABBY"" fits all constraints.

So the next guess is ""CABBY"".

We now have four pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
2. PLANT → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(x)
3. MAGIC → M(x) A(✓) G(x) I(x) C(-)
4. CABBY → C(✓) A(✓) B(x) B(x) Y(✓)

From these we can deduce the exact pattern of the secret word:

- Position 1: C (✓)
- Position 2: A (✓)
- Position 3: not B (x)
- Position 4: not B (x)
- Position 5: Y (✓)

So the word looks like: C A _ _ Y

Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, P, L, N, T, M, G, I, B

Remaining untested common letters: D, F, H, J, K, U, V, W, X, Z

We need two more letters (positions 3 and 4) from this remaining set, forming a valid 5-letter English word starting with ""CA"" and ending with ""Y"".

Possible combinations:
- CADY? (but D is untested, Y is already used)
- CAVY? (V is untested)
- CARY? (R is out)
- CAPY? (P is out)
- CANY? (N is out)
- CAY? too short
- CAVY is a valid word (short for cavies or a variant spelling)

Other possibilities:
- CADY - but D is untested
- CAVY - valid word

Checking ""CAVY"":
- C(1) ✓
- A(2) ✓
- V(3) - new
- Y(5) ✓
- Position 4 is missing, so CAVY is 4 letters, not 5.

Wait, the pattern is C A _ _ Y, so positions 3 and 4 are missing.

Looking for 5-letter words: C A _ _ Y

Possible words:
- C A D E Y - but E is out

- C A F E Y - E is out
- C A G Y - G is out
- C A H Y - not a word
- C A J Y - not a word

- C A N Y - N is out
- C A P Y - P is out
- C A R Y - R is out
- C A S Y - S is out
- C A T Y - T is out
- C A V Y - but this is 4 letters
- C A W Y - not a word
- C A Z Y - not a word

Actually, the only valid 5-letter word that fits C A _ _ Y is ""C A D E Y"" but E is out. ""C A V Y"" is 4 letters. ""C A R Y"" is 4 letters.

Wait, let me think again - the pattern is C A _ _ Y, so positions 3 and 4 must be filled with letters not yet ruled out.

Looking at remaining letters: D, F, H, J, K, U, V, W, X, Z

Possible combinations:
- C A D _ Y - but D is only one letter, need another
- C A F _ Y - but F is only one letter
- C A H _ Y - but H is only one letter
- C A J _ Y - but J is only one letter
- C A K _ Y - but K is only one letter
- C A U _ Y - but U is only one letter
- C A V _ Y - but V is only one letter
- C A W _ Y - but W is only one letter
- C A X _ Y - but X is only one letter
- C A Z _ Y - but Z is only one letter

Actually, the word must be C A _ _ Y with two letters in between. The only valid 5-letter word that fits this pattern is ""C A V Y"" but this is 4 letters. I must have missed something.

Looking back at the remaining letters: D, F, H, J, K, U, V, W, X, Z

Possible 5-letter words:
- C A D E Y - E is out
- C A F E Y - E is out
- C A V Y - 4 letters
- C A R Y - 4 letters
- C A P Y - 4 letters

Wait, there's ""C A D E Y"" but E is out. ""C A V E Y"" - E is out. ""C A N E Y"" - N is out. ""C A R E Y"" - R is out. ""C A P E R"" - not ending in Y.

Actually, the only valid 5-letter word that starts with CA and ends with Y is ""C A R E Y"" but R and E are out. ""C A P E R"" - not ending in Y.

This suggests I might have made an error in earlier steps. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From CABBY: C(✓) A(✓) B(x) B(x) Y(✓)

This means:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: not B
- Position 4: not B
- Position 5: Y

So the word is C A _ _ Y

Looking at remaining letters: D, F, H, J, K, U, V, W, X, Z

Possible 5-letter words:
- C A D E Y - E is out
- C A F E Y - E is out
- C A V E Y - E is out
- C A R E Y - R is out
- C A P E R - not ending in Y
- C A D D Y - D is untested, but this is C A D D Y
- C A F F Y - F is untested, but this is C A F F Y
- C A V V Y - V is untested, but this is C A V V Y

The most plausible words are:
- C A D D Y
- C A F F Y
- C A V V Y

Among these, ""C A D D Y"" is a valid word (a slang term for ""caddy""). ""C A F F Y"" is also valid. ""C A V V Y"" is less common.

Between these, ""C A D D Y"" uses D twice, which is possible. ""C A F F Y"" uses F twice. ""C A V V Y"" uses V twice.

The most common of these is ""C A D D Y"".

Therefore, the next guess is ""CADDY"".

Based on the feedback so far, the secret word must be:

C A _ _ Y
