For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains all five common vowels (A, E, O) and common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are present but in the wrong spot.

Good letters to try next: common consonants and vowels we haven’t ruled out yet. Since we know O is present and must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is already E), we can place O in 1, 2, or 4. I’ll also want to introduce new consonants like T, N, L, C, etc.

- Ends in T, but we know E is correct at 5, so this is fine.

This should help us test new letters while keeping O in a different position and confirming or denying its placement.

Reconciling the E feedback:  
- arose said E(✓) in position 5, but covey says E(-) so E is NOT in position 5.  
  Therefore arose’s feedback must have been mis-read. Actually, arose has E in position 5 marked ✓, meaning E is in position 5 and correct.  
  Covey’s E(-) means E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (since E was in position 4 in covey).  
  So E is definitely in position 5, and the word is _ O _ _ E.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains all five common vowels (A, E, O) and common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are present but in the wrong spot.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x): A is not in the word.
- R(x): R is not in the word.
- O(-): O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 3).
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position (currently position 5).

So far we know:
- The word ends in E.
- It contains an O, but not in position 3.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

Good letters to try next: common consonants and vowels we haven’t ruled out yet. Since we know O is present and must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is already E), we can place O in 1, 2, or 4. I’ll also want to introduce new consonants like T, N, L, C, etc.

A balanced next guess would be ""POINT"":
- P: new consonant
- O: known to be in the word, trying position 2
- I: new vowel
- N: new consonant
- T: new consonant
- Ends in T, but we know E is correct at 5, so this is fine.

This should help us test new letters while keeping O in a different position and confirming or denying its placement.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - Word ends in E.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - Letters A, R, S are excluded.

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   - O is now confirmed in position 2.
   - Letters P, I, N, T are excluded.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ E
- Excluded letters: A, R, S, P, I, N, T
- Still usable common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that fits _ O _ _ E and uses only allowed letters. Common endings for such patterns include:
- B O _ _ E: e.g., BOOZE, BOLDE (but BOLDE uses I which is excluded)
- C O _ _ E: e.g., COBIE, COVEY (but COVEY uses V and Y which are allowed)
- D O _ _ E: e.g., DOLCE (but uses L and C which are allowed)
- F O _ _ E: e.g., FOGEY (but uses G and Y which are allowed)
- G O _ _ E: e.g., GONER (but uses N which is excluded)
- H O _ _ E: e.g., HOBBE (but uses B and B which are allowed)
- L O _ _ E: e.g., LOUSE (but uses U and S which is excluded)
- M O _ _ E: e.g., MOUSE (but uses U and S which is excluded)
- U O _ _ E: e.g., OUILE (but starts with U and uses I which is excluded)
- W O _ _ E: e.g., WOOLE (but uses L and E which is allowed)

Looking at these, ""COBIE"" is a valid word but uses I which is excluded. ""COVEY"" is valid but uses Y which is allowed. ""DOLCE"" is valid. ""FOGEY"" is valid. ""HOBBE"" is valid. ""WOOLE"" is valid.

Among these, ""COVEY"" seems like a good choice as it tests C, V, Y which are common and haven't been excluded.

From the four pieces of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)  
   - E is in position 5.  
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.

   - O is in position 2.  
   - The second O (position 3) is in the word but NOT in position 3.

So far we know:
- Word ends in E (position 5).  
- O is in position 2.  
- There is another O somewhere else, but NOT in position 3.  
- Therefore the remaining O must be in position 1 or 4.  
- Excluded letters: A, R, S, P, I, N, T, C, V, Y, B, Z.

Still usable common consonants: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, U, W, X.

We need a 5-letter word of the form:
- O _ _ _ E with another O in position 1 or 4.

Possible patterns:
- O O _ _ E → e.g., OOMBE (invalid), OOLKE (invalid).  
- _ O _ O E → e.g., DOGGO (invalid), FOGGO (invalid), MOOGE (invalid).

Looking for valid English words:
- DOGGO: uses G (allowed), but O in position 3 would conflict with feedback.  
- FOGGO: same issue.  
- MOOGE: uses G (allowed), but O in position 3 is disallowed.

Wait, let’s re-examine: the second O must NOT be in position 3. So the word must have O in position 2 and another O in position 1 or 4.

Possible valid words:
- O O _ _ E → OOMBE (invalid), OOLKE (invalid), OOMBE (invalid).  
- _ O _ O E → e.g., DOGGO (invalid), FOGGO (invalid), MOOGE (invalid).

Actually, ""DOOED"" is D O O E D, but ends in D, not E.  
""FOOED"" is F O O E D, ends in D.  
""MOOED"" is M O O E D, ends in D.  
""DOORE"" is not a word.  
""FOOER"" is not a word.  

Wait, let’s think of actual 5-letter words ending in E with O in position 2 and another O elsewhere not in 3.

""WOOLE"" – W O O L E → W O O L E.  
  - W(1), O(2), O(3), L(4), E(5).

Actually, ""OOMPH"" is 5 letters but ends in H.  
""OOMPH"" – no.  

Realizing that common English words don’t fit this pattern, let’s re-examine the constraints:  
- _ O _ _ E with O in position 2.  
- Another O must be in position 1 or 4.  
- Excluded letters: A, R, S, P, I, N, T, C, V, Y, B, Z.

""MOOGE"" – G is allowed, but O in 3 is disallowed.  
""MOOGE"" is M O O G E → O in 3 is disallowed.  

Wait, the word must have exactly one O in position 2 and another O elsewhere not in 3.  
But common words don’t fit. Let’s list possible letters for positions 3 and 4 from allowed set: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, U, W, X.

Possible combinations:
- O O D _ E → OOD_E – no valid words.  
- O O F _ E – no.  
- O O G _ E – no.  
- O O H _ E – no.  
- O O K _ E – no.  
- O O L _ E – no.  
- O O M _ E – no.  
- O O U _ E – no.  
- O O W _ E – no.  
- O O X _ E – no.  

For _ O _ O E:
- D O _ O E → D O _ O E – need a letter in position 3 from allowed set.  
  - D O G O E – not a word.  
  - D O L O E – not a word.

This suggests no common 5-letter words fit the constraints. Rechecking feedback:  
- booze → B(x) O(✓) O(-) Z(x) E(✓)  
  - The second O (position 3) is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
  - This implies the word has O in position 2 and another O somewhere else, but NOT in position 3.  
  - Therefore the second O must be in position 1 or 4.  

Valid word: ""DOOED"" – no.  
""FOOED"" – no.  
""MOOED"" – no.  
""HOODE"" – H O O D E – O in 3 is disallowed.  

Realizing that ""HOKEY"" is invalid due to Y, let’s consider ""DOGEY"" – invalid.  
""MOOGE"" – invalid.  

Upon deeper reflection, the only remaining possibility is ""DOOED"" but it ends in D.  
Realizing that the word must have O in position 2 and another O in position 1 or 4, and no common words fit, the correct word must be ""DOOED"" but this contradicts.  

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words ending in E with O in position 2 and another O in position 1 or 4:  
- O O _ _ E → ""OOMBE"" – invalid.  
- _ O _ O E → ""DOGGO"" – invalid.  

This indicates an error in earlier steps. Re-examining:  
- booze → B(x) O(✓) O(-) Z(x) E(✓)  
  - The second O (position 3) is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
  - This means the word has O in position 2 and another O in position 1 or 4.  

Valid word: ""DOOED"" – D O O E D – ends in D.  
""FOOED"" – F O O E D – ends in D.  
""MOOED"" – M O O E D – ends in D.  
""HOODE"" – H O O D E – ends in E, but O in 3 is disallowed.  

Realizing that ""HOODE"" is actually a valid word (past tense of hood), but O in 3 is disallowed.  

Upon checking, the correct word must be ""HOODE"" despite the apparent conflict, as it’s the only valid English word fitting the pattern.  

Thus, the next guess is HOODE.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains all five common vowels (A, E, O) and common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the correct position or identifying letters that are present but in the wrong spot.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x): A is not in the word.
- R(x): R is not in the word.
- O(-): O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 3).
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position (currently position 5).

So far we know:
- The word ends in E.
- It contains an O, but not in position 3.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

Good letters to try next: common consonants and vowels we haven’t ruled out yet. Since we know O is present and must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is already E), we can place O in 1, 2, or 4. I’ll also want to introduce new consonants like T, N, L, C, etc.

A balanced next guess would be ""POINT"":
- P: new consonant
- O: known to be in the word, trying position 2
- I: new vowel
- N: new consonant
- T: new consonant
- Ends in T, but we know E is correct at 5, so this is fine.

This should help us test new letters while keeping O in a different position and confirming or denying its placement.

Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - Word ends in E.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - Letters A, R, S are excluded.

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   - O is now confirmed in position 2.
   - Letters P, I, N, T are excluded.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ E
- Excluded letters: A, R, S, P, I, N, T
- Still usable common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that fits _ O _ _ E and uses only allowed letters. Common endings for such patterns include:
- B O _ _ E: e.g., BOOZE, BOLDE (but BOLDE uses I which is excluded)
- C O _ _ E: e.g., COBIE, COVEY (but COVEY uses V and Y which are allowed)
- D O _ _ E: e.g., DOLCE (but uses L and C which are allowed)
- F O _ _ E: e.g., FOGEY (but uses G and Y which are allowed)
- G O _ _ E: e.g., GONER (but uses N which is excluded)
- H O _ _ E: e.g., HOBBE (but uses B and B which are allowed)
- L O _ _ E: e.g., LOUSE (but uses U and S which is excluded)
- M O _ _ E: e.g., MOUSE (but uses U and S which is excluded)
- U O _ _ E: e.g., OUILE (but starts with U and uses I which is excluded)
- W O _ _ E: e.g., WOOLE (but uses L and E which is allowed)

Looking at these, ""COBIE"" is a valid word but uses I which is excluded. ""COVEY"" is valid but uses Y which is allowed. ""DOLCE"" is valid. ""FOGEY"" is valid. ""HOBBE"" is valid. ""WOOLE"" is valid.

Among these, ""COVEY"" seems like a good choice as it tests C, V, Y which are common and haven't been excluded.

From the three pieces of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)  
   - Ends with E.  
   - O is somewhere in the word, not position 3.  
   - Excludes A, R, S.

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   - Confirms O in position 2.  
   - Excludes P, I, N, T.

3. covey → C(x) O(✓) V(x) E(-) Y(x)  
   - Confirms O in position 2 again.  
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (contradicting the earlier “E(✓)” from arose).  
   - Excludes C, V, Y.

Reconciling the E feedback:  
- arose said E(✓) in position 5, but covey says E(-) so E is NOT in position 5.  
  Therefore arose’s feedback must have been mis-read. Actually, arose has E in position 5 marked ✓, meaning E is in position 5 and correct.  
  Covey’s E(-) means E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (since E was in position 4 in covey).  
  So E is definitely in position 5, and the word is _ O _ _ E.

Letters excluded so far: A, R, S, P, I, N, T, C, V, Y.

Still usable common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, U, W, X, Z.

We need a word fitting _ O _ _ E using only these letters.  
Possible patterns:  
- B O _ _ E → BOBEE (invalid), BOLDE (invalid), BOOZE (invalid).  
- D O _ _ E → DOLCE (invalid), DOGGE (invalid).  
- F O _ _ E → FOGEY (invalid), FOGIE (invalid).  
- G O _ _ E → GONER (invalid), GOLGE (invalid).  
- H O _ _ E → HOBBE (invalid), HOGGE (invalid).  
- L O _ _ E → LOUSE (invalid), LOVER (invalid).  
- M O _ _ E → MOUSE (invalid), MOOSE (invalid).  
- U O _ _ E → OUILE (invalid).  
- W O _ _ E → WOOLE (invalid), WORSE (invalid).

Looking for valid English words:  
- BOOZE: uses Z (allowed), but O is already in position 2.  
- BOOZE → B O O Z E → positions: 1=B, 2=O, 3=O, 4=Z, 5=E.  
  - O is allowed in position 3 (only position 3 was previously excluded for O, but that was in arose, which was mis-read).  
  - Letters: B, O, Z are allowed.  
  - This fits _ O _ _ E pattern with O in 3 allowed.

Another candidate:  
- BOOZE seems valid and tests new letters B and Z.

Thus, BOOZE is a good next guess.

From the four pieces of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)  
   - E is in position 5.  
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - Excludes A, R, S.

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   - O is in position 2.  
   - Excludes P, I, N, T.

3. covey → C(x) O(✓) V(x) E(-) Y(x)  
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   - Excludes C, V, Y.

4. booze → B(x) O(✓) O(-) Z(x) E(✓)  
   - O is in position 2.  
   - The second O (position 3) is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - Excludes B, Z.

So far we know:
- Word ends in E (position 5).  
- O is in position 2.  
- There is another O somewhere else, but NOT in position 3.  
- Therefore the remaining O must be in position 1 or 4.  
- Excluded letters: A, R, S, P, I, N, T, C, V, Y, B, Z.

Still usable common consonants: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, U, W, X.

We need a 5-letter word of the form:
- O _ _ _ E with another O in position 1 or 4.

Possible patterns:
- O O _ _ E → e.g., OOMBE (invalid), OOLKE (invalid).  
- _ O _ O E → e.g., DOGGO (invalid), FOGGO (invalid), MOOGE (invalid).

Looking for valid English words:
- DOGGO: uses G (allowed), but O in position 3 would conflict with feedback.  
- FOGGO: same issue.  
- MOOGE: uses G (allowed), but O in position 3 is disallowed.  
- HOKEY: uses K (allowed), but HOKEY is H O K E Y, ends in Y which is excluded.  
- DOGIE: uses I which is excluded.  
- FOGIE: uses I which is excluded.  
- MOOSE: uses S which is excluded.  
- LOUSE: uses S and U, but S is excluded.  
- WOOZE: uses Z which is excluded.  
- DOOZE: uses Z which is excluded.  
- FOULS: uses S which is excluded.  
- GOOFY: uses Y which is excluded.  
- HOOKE: H O O K E → positions: H(1), O(2), O(3), K(4), E(5).  
  - O is in position 2 (correct).  
  - Second O is in position 3, but feedback says O(-) in position 3 (booze), so this is disallowed.  
- JOKER: uses J, K, R (R excluded).  
- KOOKS: uses S which is excluded.  
- LOVER: uses R and V (both excluded).  
- MOWER: uses R and V (both excluded).  
- NOOKY: uses N which is excluded.  
- POOKE: uses P which is excluded.  
- ROOED: uses R which is excluded.  
- TOWER: uses T and R (both excluded).  
- WOOER: uses W, O, E, R (R excluded).  
- YOKER: uses Y and R (both excluded).

Wait, let’s re-examine: the second O must NOT be in position 3. So the word must have O in position 2 and another O in position 1 or 4.

Possible valid words:
- O O _ _ E → OOMBE (invalid), OOLKE (invalid), OOMBE (invalid).  
- _ O _ O E → e.g., DOGGO (invalid), FOGGO (invalid), MOOGE (invalid).

Actually, ""DOOED"" is D O O E D, but ends in D, not E.  
""FOOED"" is F O O E D, ends in D.  
""MOOED"" is M O O E D, ends in D.  
""DOORE"" is not a word.  
""FOOER"" is not a word.  

Wait, let’s think of actual 5-letter words ending in E with O in position 2 and another O elsewhere not in 3.

Valid word: ""DOOED"" – no, ends in D.  
""FOOED"" – no.  
""MOOED"" – no.  
""BOOGE"" – B is excluded.  
""COOED"" – C is excluded.  
""HOODE"" – H O O D E → H O O D E.  
  - H(1), O(2), O(3), D(4), E(5).  
  - O is in position 2 (correct).  
  - Second O is in position 3, but feedback says O(-) in position 3 (booze), so this is disallowed.  

Another candidate: ""FOOGE"" – not a word.  
""KOORE"" – not a word.  
""WOOLE"" – W O O L E → W O O L E.  
  - W(1), O(2), O(3), L(4), E(5).  
  - Same issue with O in 3.  

Wait, the only remaining possibility is that the second O is in position 1, making the word O O _ _ E.  
Valid 5-letter words:  
- OOMBE – invalid.  
- OOLKE – invalid.  
- OOKEE – invalid.  
- OOZED – Z is excluded.  

Actually, ""OOMPH"" is 5 letters but ends in H.  
""OOMPH"" – no.  

Realizing that common English words don’t fit this pattern, let’s re-examine the constraints:  
- _ O _ _ E with O in position 2.  
- Another O must be in position 1 or 4.  
- Excluded letters: A, R, S, P, I, N, T, C, V, Y, B, Z.  
- Allowed letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, U, W, X.

Possible valid word: ""HOKEY"" – ends in Y (excluded).  
""DOGEY"" – ends in Y (excluded).  
""MOOGE"" – G is allowed, but O in 3 is disallowed.  
""MOOGE"" is M O O G E → O in 3 is disallowed.  

Wait, the word must have exactly one O in position 2 and another O elsewhere not in 3.  
But common words don’t fit. Let’s list possible letters for positions 3 and 4 from allowed set: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, U, W, X.

Possible combinations:
- O O D _ E → OOD_E – no valid words.  
- O O F _ E – no.  
- O O G _ E – no.  
- O O H _ E – no.  
- O O K _ E – no.  
- O O L _ E – no.  
- O O M _ E – no.  
- O O U _ E – no.  
- O O W _ E – no.  
- O O X _ E – no.  

For _ O _ O E:
- D O _ O E → D O _ O E – need a letter in position 3 from allowed set.  
  - D O G O E – not a word.  
  - D O L O E – not a word.  
  - D O M O E – not a word.  
  - F O _ O E → F O G O E – not a word.  
  - F O L O E – not a word.  
  - F O M O E – not a word.  
  - H O _ O E → H O G O E – not a word.  
  - H O L O E – not a word.  
  - H O M O E – not a word.  
  - J O _ O E – no.  
  - K O _ O E – no.  
  - L O _ O E – no.  
  - M O _ O E – no.  
  - U O _ O E – no.  
  - W O _ O E – no.  
  - X O _ O E – no.  

This suggests no common 5-letter words fit the constraints. Rechecking feedback:  
- booze → B(x) O(✓) O(-) Z(x) E(✓)  
  - The second O (position 3) is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
  - This implies the word has O in position 2 and another O somewhere else, but NOT in position 3.  
  - Therefore the second O must be in position 1 or 4.  

Valid word: ""DOOED"" – no.  
""FOOED"" – no.  
""MOOED"" – no.  
""HOODE"" – H O O D E – O in 3 is disallowed.  

Realizing that ""HOKEY"" is invalid due to Y, let’s consider ""DOGEY"" – invalid.  
""MOOGE"" – invalid.  

Upon deeper reflection, the only remaining possibility is ""DOOED"" but it ends in D.  
Realizing that the word must have O in position 2 and another O in position 1 or 4, and no common words fit, the correct word must be ""DOOED"" but this contradicts.  

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words ending in E with O in position 2 and another O in position 1 or 4:  
- O O _ _ E → ""OOMBE"" – invalid.  
- _ O _ O E → ""DOGGO"" – invalid.  

This indicates an error in earlier steps. Re-examining:  
- booze → B(x) O(✓) O(-) Z(x) E(✓)  
  - The second O (position 3) is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
  - This means the word has O in position 2 and another O in position 1 or 4.  

Valid word: ""DOOED"" – D O O E D – ends in D.  
""FOOED"" – F O O E D – ends in D.  
""MOOED"" – M O O E D – ends in D.  
""HOODE"" – H O O D E – ends in E, but O in 3 is disallowed.  

Realizing that ""HOODE"" is actually a valid word (past tense of hood), but O in 3 is disallowed.  

Upon checking, the correct word must be ""HOODE"" despite the apparent conflict, as it’s the only valid English word fitting the pattern.  

Thus, the next guess is HOODE.From all feedback, the word must be of the form:
- O in position 2  
- Another O in position 1 or 4 (but not 3)  
- Ends in E  

The only valid 5-letter English word that fits these constraints is:

From the latest feedback on HOODE:
- H(x) → H is not in the word.  
- O(✓) → O is in position 2 (confirmed again).  
- O(-) → the second O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
- D(-) → D is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
- E(✓) → E is in position 5 (confirmed).

So the word pattern is:
- Position 2: O  
- Position 5: E  
- Contains another O, but NOT in position 3.  
- Contains D, but NOT in position 4.

Possible positions for the second O: position 1 (since position 4 is still open, but let’s list all).

Thus the word must be of the form:
- O in 2, E in 5, another O in 1 or 4, and include D somewhere not in 4.

Let’s enumerate:

Case 1: second O in position 1 → O O _ _ E  
   Then positions 3 and 4 must be filled with allowed letters (not excluded yet: allowed letters are D, F, G, J, K, L, M, U, W, X, etc.), and D must appear somewhere (but not in 4).  
   So possible: O O D _ E → need a letter in 4 from allowed set.  
   Valid words:  
   - OODLE – but L is allowed, D is in 3 (allowed).  
   - OOGLE – G is allowed.  
   - OOKEY – K is allowed, but Y excluded.  
   - OOMBE – invalid.  
   - OOLKE – invalid.  

Case 2: second O in position 4 → _ O _ O E  
   Then positions 1 and 3 must be filled with allowed letters, and D must appear somewhere (not in 4, so it must be in 1 or 3).  
   Possible:  
   - D O _ O E → need a letter in 3 from allowed set.  
     - D O G O E – not a word.  
     - D O L O E – not a word.  
     - D O M O E – not a word.  
   - F O D O E – not a word.  
   - M O D O E – not a word.  

From these, the only valid English word fitting is OODLE (O O D L E), but let’s verify:  
- O O D L E  
  - O in 2 (✓)  
  - E in 5 (✓)  
  - another O in 1 (allowed)  
  - D in 3 (allowed)  
  - All letters are allowed (D, L not excluded).  

But wait, OODLE has O in 1 and 2, which fits the pattern.  

Another candidate: OOGLE → O O G L E.  
- O in 2 (✓)  
- E in 5 (✓)  
- another O in 1 (allowed)  
- G and L are allowed.  

Between OODLE and OOGLE, OODLE is more common.  

Thus, the next guess is OODLE.
