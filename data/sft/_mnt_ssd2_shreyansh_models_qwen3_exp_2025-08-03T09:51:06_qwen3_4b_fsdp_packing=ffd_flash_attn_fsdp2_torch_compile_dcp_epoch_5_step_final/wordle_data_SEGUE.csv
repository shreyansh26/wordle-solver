### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these letters without repeating any. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will help us quickly identify which of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- C(x) → C is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: S _ _ _ E
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, L, I, C
- Letters still possible: T, N, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S and ending with E, using only letters not yet ruled out.  
Possible middle letters: T, N, U, D, G, H, M, P, Y, B, F, K, V, W, X, Z, etc.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<|im_end|>

For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these letters without repeating any. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will help us quickly identify which of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word, but not in position 4.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains S somewhere, but not in position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or O.

Good letters left to test: T, L, N, I, C, U, Y, etc.
We want a word that ends with E, has an S not in position 4, and avoids A, R, O.

Possible candidates: STILE, SLICE, STONE, STEIN, etc.
""SLICE"" seems good because:
- Ends with E.
- Has S in position 1 (not 4).
- Uses L, I, C which are common and haven't been tested.
- Avoids A, R, O.

Step-by-step deductions so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
   - Ends with E (position 5).
   - Contains S, but not in position 4.
   - Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

2. slice → S(✓) L(x) I(x) C(x) E(✓)
   - S is fixed in position 1.
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - L, I, C are not in the word.

3. steve → S(✓) T(x) E(-) V(x) E(✓)
   - S is confirmed at position 1.
   - E is confirmed at position 5.
   - T and V are not in the word.
   - The middle E (position 3) is marked “-”, meaning there is an E in the word but it is NOT in position 3. However, position 5 is already E (✓), so the word must contain exactly one E (at position 5), and the “-” here simply confirms that E is indeed present (no additional E elsewhere).

Ruled-out letters: A, R, O, L, I, C, T, V  
Known pattern: S _ _ _ E

Remaining unused letters (common ones): N, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, U, Y, K, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S, ends with E.
- Uses only letters not in the ruled-out set.
- Has no other E except at position 5.

Candidate words:
- SNARE → A and R are ruled out.
- SPEKE → K and P are allowed, but double E might be unlikely.
- STONE → O is ruled out.
- SPEKE → seems possible but rare.
- SMOTE → O is ruled out.
- SPEKE is the most plausible remaining.

However, let’s list simpler options:
- S _ _ _ E with allowed letters: N, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, U, Y, K, W.

Possible combinations:
- S N _ _ E → SN _ _ E: SNARE (A out), SNIDE (I out), etc.
- S P _ _ E → SPEKE (K is allowed), SPEKE is a valid word (variant spelling of Speke).
- S M _ _ E → SM _ _ E: SMEAR (A out), SMEDE (not a word), etc.
- S B _ _ E → SB _ _ E: none common.
- S F _ _ E → SF _ _ E: none common.
- S H _ _ E → SH _ _ E: SH _ _ E: SHOBE (O out), etc.
- S U _ _ E → SU _ _ E: SUITE (I out), etc.
- S W _ _ E → SW _ _ E: SW _ _ E: SWINE (I out), etc.

The best remaining candidate appears to be **SPEKE**, but let’s double-check simpler words:
- SPEKE: S P E K E – but E is in position 3, which was ruled out (feedback shows E in position 5 only). So SPEKE is invalid because it has E in position 3.

Re-evaluate: we need no E except at position 5. So the word must be S _ _ _ E with no E elsewhere.

Possible words:
- SN _ _ E: SN _ _ E: SNARE (A out), SNIDE (I out), SNUPE (U and P allowed) – SNUPE is valid.
- SP _ _ E: SP _ _ E: SPEKE (invalid), SP _ _ E: SPUME (U and M allowed) – SPUME is valid.
- SM _ _ E: SM _ _ E: SMEAR (A out), SMEDE (not a word), etc.
- SH _ _ E: SH _ _ E: SHOBE (O out), etc.
- SW _ _ E: SW _ _ E: SWINE (I out), etc.

Between SNUPE and SPUME, SPUME is more common.

Let’s verify SPUME:
- S P U M E
- S in position 1 (✓)
- E in position 5 (✓)
- Letters: P, U, M are all unused and not ruled out.
- No additional E except at position 5.

Thus, SPUME is a valid next guess.

The best remaining candidate appears to be **SPEKE**, but let’s double-check simpler words:
- SPEKE: S P E K E – but E is in position 3, which was ruled out (feedback shows E in position 5 only). So SPEKE is invalid because it has E in position 3.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these letters without repeating any. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will help us quickly identify which of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

   - S is in position 1 (✓).
   - E is in position 5 (✓), consistent.
   - L, I, C are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: S _ _ _ E
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, L, I, C
- S is fixed in position 1, E in position 5.

We need three more letters that are not among the ruled-out set. Common remaining consonants: T, N, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, etc. Common vowels left: U, Y.

Possible words:
- STONE (but O is ruled out)
- STONE is invalid (O is out)
- STEVE (but V is untested, but E is already at end)
- STEVE has V which is new
- STONE invalid
- STEIN (I is out)
- STONE invalid
- STEVE seems valid: S T E V E
   - S in 1, E in 5
   - T and V are new letters
   - No ruled-out letters used

Step-by-step deductions so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
   - Ends with E (position 5).
   - Contains S, but not in position 4.
   - Does NOT contain A, R, or O.

2. slice → S(✓) L(x) I(x) C(x) E(✓)
   - S is fixed in position 1.
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - L, I, C are not in the word.

3. steve → S(✓) T(x) E(-) V(x) E(✓)
   - S is confirmed at position 1.
   - E is confirmed at position 5.
   - T and V are not in the word.
   - The middle E (position 3) is marked “-”, meaning there is an E in the word but it is NOT in position 3. However, position 5 is already E (✓), so the word must contain exactly one E (at position 5), and the “-” here simply confirms that E is indeed present (no additional E elsewhere).

Ruled-out letters: A, R, O, L, I, C, T, V  
Known pattern: S _ _ _ E

Remaining unused letters (common ones): N, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, U, Y, K, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S, ends with E.
- Uses only letters not in the ruled-out set.
- Has no other E except at position 5.

Candidate words:
- SNARE → A and R are ruled out.
- SPEKE → K and P are allowed, but double E might be unlikely.
- STONE → O is ruled out.
- SPEKE → seems possible but rare.
- SMOTE → O is ruled out.
- SPEKE is the most plausible remaining.

However, let’s list simpler options:
- S _ _ _ E with allowed letters: N, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, U, Y, K, W.

Possible combinations:
- S N _ _ E → SN _ _ E: SNARE (A out), SNIDE (I out), etc.
- S P _ _ E → SPEKE (K is allowed), SPEKE is a valid word (variant spelling of Speke).
- S M _ _ E → SM _ _ E: SMEAR (A out), SMEDE (not a word), etc.
- S B _ _ E → SB _ _ E: none common.
- S F _ _ E → SF _ _ E: none common.
- S H _ _ E → SH _ _ E: SH _ _ E: SHOBE (O out), etc.
- S U _ _ E → SU _ _ E: SUITE (I out), etc.
- S W _ _ E → SW _ _ E: SW _ _ E: SWINE (I out), etc.

The best remaining candidate appears to be **SPEKE**, but let’s double-check simpler words:
- SPEKE: S P E K E – but E is in position 3, which was ruled out (feedback shows E in position 5 only). So SPEKE is invalid because it has E in position 3.

Re-evaluate: we need no E except at position 5. So the word must be S _ _ _ E with no E elsewhere.

Possible words:
- SN _ _ E: SN _ _ E: SNARE (A out), SNIDE (I out), SNUPE (U and P allowed) – SNUPE is valid.
- SP _ _ E: SP _ _ E: SPEKE (invalid), SP _ _ E: SPUME (U and M allowed) – SPUME is valid.
- SM _ _ E: SM _ _ E: SMEAR (A out), SMEDE (not a word), etc.
- SH _ _ E: SH _ _ E: SHOBE (O out), etc.
- SW _ _ E: SW _ _ E: SWINE (I out), etc.

Between SNUPE and SPUME, SPUME is more common.

Let’s verify SPUME:
- S P U M E
- S in position 1 (✓)
- E in position 5 (✓)
- Letters: P, U, M are all unused and not ruled out.
- No additional E except at position 5.

Thus, SPUME is a valid next guess.

From all feedback so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)  
   – Word ends with E (pos 5).  
   – Contains S, but S is not in position 4.

2. slice → S(✓) L(x) I(x) C(x) E(✓)  
   – S is fixed in position 1.  
   – E is fixed in position 5.

3. steve → S(✓) T(x) E(-) V(x) E(✓)

   – E is in the word but not at position 3 (already known to be at 5).

4. spume → S(✓) P(x) U(-) M(x) E(✓)  
   – Confirms S at 1, E at 5.  
   – P and M are not in the word.  
   – U is in the word but not at position 3.

So the pattern is:  
S _ _ _ E  
Letters known to be absent: A, R, O, L, I, C, T, V, P, M  
Letters known to be present: U (somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4)  
Only remaining common letters: N, D, G, H, K, Y, W, F, B

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, ending with E, containing U, and using only allowed letters.

Possible structure: S U _ _ E or S _ U _ E or S _ _ U E  
But position 3 cannot be E (already fixed at 5), and we have no info preventing U from being in positions 2, 3, or 4.

Let’s list candidates:

- S U _ _ E:  
  – SUINE (I out)  
  – SUGUE (G and U allowed) – not a word  
  – SUNGE (N and G allowed) – not a word  
  – SUPEE (double E) – invalid  

- S _ U _ E:  
  – SNUKE (N, K allowed) – valid word  
  – SNUKE is a real word (variant spelling of “snuck” or “snook”)

- S _ _ U E:  
  – SDUUE (invalid)  
  – SKUUE (invalid)
