### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in the English language. This helps maximize the chance of getting at least one letter in the correct position or identifying which letters are present/absent.

Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. A good first guess would be something like:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U - but fewer consonants)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers common consonants (C, R, N) and vowels (A, E), giving me a broad initial probe of the alphabet.

- A _ R _ E → A must be in position 1, R in position 3.
- _ A _ R E → A in position 2 (but A cannot be in position 2 from CRANE feedback), so invalid.
- _ _ A R E → A in position 3 (but A cannot be in position 3 from CRANE feedback), so invalid.
- R _ A _ E → R in position 1 (but R cannot be in position 1 from RAISE feedback), so invalid.
- _ R A _ E → R in position 2 (but R cannot be in position 2 from CRANE feedback), so invalid.

The only valid pattern seems to be:
A _ R _ E

Possible words fitting this pattern:
- AROSE – but S is excluded.
- ARGUE – G is allowed, positions: A(1) R(3) G(2) U(4) E(5). Check constraints:
  - R in position 3 (allowed, since R cannot be in 1 or 2).
  - A in position 1 (allowed, since A cannot be in 2 or 3).
  - No C, N, I, S.
  - ARGUE is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s try ARGUE.

From the new feedback on ARGUE:

- A(✓) → A is in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- G(x) → G is not in the word.
- U(-) → U is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(✓) → E is confirmed in position 5.

So we now know:
- Word pattern: A _ _ _ E
- Must contain R and U somewhere in positions 2-4.
- R cannot be in position 2 (from ARGUE) and cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from earlier feedback), so R must be in position 3 or 4.
- U cannot be in position 4 (from ARGUE) and cannot be in position 2 (from CRANE feedback), so U must be in position 2 or 3.
- Excluded letters: C, N, I, S, G.

Possible positions:
- R must be in 3 or 4.
- U must be in 2 or 3.
- We need a valid word A _ _ _ E with R and U in allowed positions.

Let’s list possibilities:
1. A U R _ E → positions: A(1) U(2) R(3) _ (4) E(5)
   - R in position 3 is allowed.
   - U in position 2 is allowed.
   - Need a letter for position 4 that is not excluded. Available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - Possible words: AURBE (invalid), AURDE (invalid), AURFE (invalid), etc. None seem valid.

2. A _ U R E → positions: A(1) _ (2) U(3) R(4) E(5)
   - R in position 4 is allowed.
   - U in position 3 is allowed.
   - Need a letter for position 2 that is not excluded. Possible letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - Valid words: A B U R E → ABURE (invalid), A D U R E → ADURE (invalid), A F U R E → AFURE (invalid), A L U R E → ALURE (invalid), A P U R E → APURE (invalid), A T U R E → ATURE (invalid), A V U R E → AVURE (invalid), A W U R E → AWURE (invalid), A Y U R E → AYURE (invalid).
   - None of these are valid English words.

3. A U _ R E → positions: A(1) U(2) _ (3) R(4) E(5)
   - R in position 4 is allowed.
   - U in position 2 is allowed.
   - Need a letter for position 3 that is not excluded. Possible letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - Valid words: A U B R E → AUBRE (invalid), A U D R E → AUDRE (invalid), A U F R E → AUFRE (invalid), A U L R E → AULRE (invalid), A U M R E → AUMRE (invalid), A U P R E → AUPRE (invalid), A U T R E → AUTRE (invalid), A U V R E → AUVRE (invalid), A U W R E → A UWRE (invalid), A U Y R E → AUYRE (invalid).
   - None of these are valid English words.

4. A _ R U E → positions: A(1) _ (2) R(3) U(4) E(5)
   - R in position 3 is allowed.
   - U in position 4 is not allowed (from ARGUE feedback).

5. A R U _ E → positions: A(1) R(2) U(3) _ (4) E(5)
   - R in position 2 is not allowed (from ARGUE feedback).

6. A _ _ U R E → impossible (only 5 letters).

Wait, let’s re-examine possible combinations more carefully.

We need:
- A _ _ _ E
- Must contain R and U in positions 2-4.
- R cannot be in positions 1,2 → must be in 3,4.
- U cannot be in positions 2,4 → must be in 2,3.
- So possible combinations:
   - A U R _ E → R in 3, U in 2 → need letter for position 4.
   - A _ U R E → U in 3, R in 4 → need letter for position 2.

Let’s check if any valid words fit these patterns.

Pattern A U R _ E:
- Need a letter for position 4 that is not excluded (C,N,I,S,G).
   - Possible letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - Valid words: AURBE (invalid), AURDE (invalid), AURFE (invalid), AURHE (invalid), AURJE (invalid), AURKE (invalid), AURL E → AURL E is invalid, AURME (invalid), AURPE (invalid), AURTE (invalid), AURVE (invalid), AURWE (invalid), AURXE (invalid), AURY E → AURY E is invalid, AURZE (invalid).
   - None are valid.

Pattern A _ U R E:
- Need a letter for position 2 that is not excluded.
   - Possible letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - Valid words: A B U R E → ABURE (invalid), A D U R E → ADURE (invalid), A F U R E → AFURE (invalid), A H U R E → AHURE (invalid), A J U R E → AJURE (invalid), A K U R E → AKURE (invalid), A L U R E → ALURE (invalid), A M U R E → AMURE (invalid), A P U R E → APURE (invalid), A T U R E → ATURE (invalid), A V U R E → AVURE (invalid), A W U R E → AWURE (invalid), A X U R E → AXURE (invalid), A Y U R E → AYURE (invalid), A Z U R E → AZURE (invalid).
   - AZURE is a valid English word!

So the only valid word fitting all constraints is AZURE.

Let’s verify:
- A Z U R E
- Pattern: A(1) Z(2) U(3) R(4) E(5)
- A is correct in position 1 (from ARGUE).
- R is in position 4 (allowed, since R cannot be in 1,2).
- U is in position 3 (allowed, since U cannot be in 2,4).
- Z is a new letter (allowed).
- No excluded letters (C,N,I,S,G) are present.

Therefore, AZURE is the correct next guess.
