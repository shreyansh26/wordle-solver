### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting letters include S, T, R, L, N, and vowels like A, E, I, O, U. A good starting word should also avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible.

After considering these factors, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (very common letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination tests 5 unique, high-frequency letters that should give good coverage for the secret word.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ R A _ E
- Letters known to be in the word: R (pos 2), A (pos 3), E (pos 5)
- Letters known NOT in the word: S, L, T, N, G, D
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (from CRANE feedback).

So the word must contain C somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but positions 2 and 3 are already R and A, so C must be in position 1 or 4). However, position 1 cannot be C because C(-) in CRANE means C is not in position 1. Therefore, C must be in position 4.

Thus, the word is _ R A C E.

Now we just need to determine the first letter. It cannot be any of the ruled-out letters (S, L, T, N, G, D) and cannot be R, A, E (already placed). Common remaining consonants: B, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

Possible words:
- BRAKE (but K is okay)
- CRACE (invalid, C already used in position 4)
- FRACE (not a common word)
- PRACE (not a common word)
- TRACE (but T is ruled out)
- GRACE (G is ruled out)
- BRAVE (but A is in position 3)
- CRATE (T is ruled out)
- TRACE (T is ruled out)
- GRATE (G is ruled out)
- PRASE (S is ruled out)
- BRAKE seems the only valid common word left.

But BRAKE has K in position 4, which would contradict our deduction that position 4 must be C. Therefore, the word must be _ R A C E.

The only remaining consonant for position 1 that hasn't been ruled out and forms a valid word is B, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y. Among these, ""BRACE"" is a valid word, but E is already in position 5, so ""BRACE"" would have E in position 4, which is impossible. Similarly, ""CRACE"" is invalid.

Looking back, the only valid word that fits _ R A C E is ""BRACE"" but that would require E in position 4, which conflicts with E in position 5. This suggests an error in our deduction.

Wait, let me re-examine: from CRANE, C is in the word but not in position 1. From GRADE, G is not in the word. So C must be in position 4. Thus, the word is _ R A C E.

Possible first letters: B, F, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y. Among these, ""BRACE"" is invalid (E in wrong position), ""CRACE"" invalid, ""FRACE"" not a word, ""PRACE"" not a word, ""TRACE"" invalid (T ruled out), etc. 

But ""BRACE"" is actually B R A C E, which fits _ R A C E. The E in position 5 is correct, and the word is BRACE. This seems to be the only valid word left.

Therefore, the next guess should be BRACE.
