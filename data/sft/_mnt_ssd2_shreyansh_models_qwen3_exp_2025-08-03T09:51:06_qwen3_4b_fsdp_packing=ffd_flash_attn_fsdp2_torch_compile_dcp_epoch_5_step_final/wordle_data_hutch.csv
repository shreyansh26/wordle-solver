### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to quickly identify which letters are present or absent.

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and each letter is in a different position. This will help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

All five letters in “arose” (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear in the secret word at all.

Possible candidates: “DUTCH” (D, U, T, C, H) – all letters are new except T and U, and U is in position 2 (not 1). This seems like a good test.

Letters confirmed in the word and their positions:

- U is in position 2 (✓)
- C is in position 3 (✓)
- H is in position 5 (✓)

Letters ruled out completely: A, R, O, S, E, N, I, L, D

Available letters (not yet ruled out and not already used): B, F, G, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the vowels we’ve already excluded (A, E, I, O, U) – so only the consonants listed above are possible.

Looking for 5-letter words that fit “? U C T H”:

- BUTCH (B is available)
- GUTCH (G is available)
- MUCKT (invalid, not a word)
- PUCKT (invalid)
- FUCTH (invalid)

The only valid word in the pattern is “BUTCH”.

Let’s check: B, U, C, T, H – none of these letters have been ruled out except D, and B hasn’t been tested yet.

Therefore, the next logical guess is BUTCH.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to quickly identify which letters are present or absent.

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and each letter is in a different position. This will help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

All five letters in “arose” (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
That eliminates the most common letters in English, so I now need a word that uses entirely different letters.  
The next most common remaining letters are T, N, I, L, C, U, Y, D, H, M, etc.  
A good second guess that uses five new, high-frequency letters is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L).  
This will help me quickly narrow down which of the remaining common letters are in the word.

From the feedback:

- Letters **not** in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, N, I, L  
- Letters **confirmed** in the word: T (and it is in the 4th position)  
- Letter **U** is in the word but not in the 1st position.

So far the pattern is: _ _ T _ _ (with T fixed in position 4) and U somewhere else.

Remaining high-frequency letters not yet ruled out: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus B, J, Q, X, Z (but those are less likely).

I want a word that:
1. Has T in position 4.
2. Contains U but not in position 1.
3. Uses new letters not yet tested.

Possible candidates: “DUTCH” (D, U, T, C, H) – all letters are new except T and U, and U is in position 2 (not 1). This seems like a good test.

Pattern: _ U T _ _ → DUTCH fits perfectly.

From the feedback so far:

Letters confirmed in the word and their positions:
- T is in position 4 (✓)
- U is in position 2 (✓)
- C is in position 3 (✓)
- H is in position 5 (✓)

Letters ruled out completely: A, R, O, S, E, N, I, L, D

So the word pattern is now:
_ U C T H

The only unknown is the first letter.  
Available letters (not yet ruled out and not already used): B, F, G, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the vowels we’ve already excluded (A, E, I, O, U) – so only the consonants listed above are possible.

Looking for 5-letter words that fit “? U C T H”:

- BUTCH (B is available)
- GUTCH (G is available)
- MUCKT (invalid, not a word)
- PUCKT (invalid)
- FUCTH (invalid)

The only valid word in the pattern is “BUTCH”.

Let’s check: B, U, C, T, H – none of these letters have been ruled out except D, and B hasn’t been tested yet.

Therefore, the next logical guess is BUTCH.

From the feedback so far we know the word pattern is: _ U C T H

Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, S, E, N, I, L, D, B

The only letters left that can go in the first position are: F, G, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit “?UCTH”:

- GUTCH – not a valid word
- JUCKT – not a word
- KUCKT – not a word
- MUCKT – not a word
- PUCKT – not a word
- FUCTH – not a word
- VUCKT – not a word
- WUCKT – not a word
- YUCKT – not a word

Wait, let me double-check common words ending in “UCHT” – none of these are standard.  
However, “MUCKT” isn’t a word, but “MUCKY” is, and “MUCKS” is, but they don’t fit the pattern.  
Let me re-examine the pattern: _ U C T H

The only valid English word that fits this exact pattern is “GUTCH” – but it’s not in standard dictionaries.  
Upon closer inspection, the correct word must be “GUTCH” or similar, but none seem valid.  
Realizing the pattern must be “? U C T H”, the only possible valid word is “GUTCH” – but it’s obscure.  
However, checking again, the word “GUTCH” is not standard.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters to quickly identify which letters are present or absent.

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and each letter is in a different position. This will help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in “arose” (A, R, O, S, E) are marked “x”, so none of them appear in the secret word at all.  
That eliminates the most common letters in English, so I now need a word that uses entirely different letters.  
The next most common remaining letters are T, N, I, L, C, U, Y, D, H, M, etc.  
A good second guess that uses five new, high-frequency letters is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L).  
This will help me quickly narrow down which of the remaining common letters are in the word.

From the feedback:

- Letters **not** in the word at all: A, R, O, S, E, N, I, L  
- Letters **confirmed** in the word: T (and it is in the 4th position)  
- Letter **U** is in the word but not in the 1st position.

So far the pattern is: _ _ T _ _ (with T fixed in position 4) and U somewhere else.

Remaining high-frequency letters not yet ruled out: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus B, J, Q, X, Z (but those are less likely).

I want a word that:
1. Has T in position 4.
2. Contains U but not in position 1.
3. Uses new letters not yet tested.

Possible candidates: “DUTCH” (D, U, T, C, H) – all letters are new except T and U, and U is in position 2 (not 1). This seems like a good test.

Pattern: _ U T _ _ → DUTCH fits perfectly.

Guess 3: dutch -> FEEDBACK: D(x) U(✓) T(✓) C(✓) H(✓)

From the feedback so far:

Letters confirmed in the word and their positions:
- T is in position 4 (✓)
- U is in position 2 (✓)
- C is in position 3 (✓)
- H is in position 5 (✓)

Letters ruled out completely: A, R, O, S, E, N, I, L, D

So the word pattern is now:
_ U C T H

The only unknown is the first letter.  
Available letters (not yet ruled out and not already used): B, F, G, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, plus the vowels we’ve already excluded (A, E, I, O, U) – so only the consonants listed above are possible.

Looking for 5-letter words that fit “? U C T H”:

- BUTCH (B is available)
- GUTCH (G is available)
- MUCKT (invalid, not a word)
- PUCKT (invalid)
- FUCTH (invalid)

The only valid word in the pattern is “BUTCH”.

Let’s check: B, U, C, T, H – none of these letters have been ruled out except D, and B hasn’t been tested yet.

Therefore, the next logical guess is BUTCH.

From the feedback so far we know the exact pattern:

Position 1: NOT A, R, O, S, E, N, I, L, D, B  
Position 2: U (✓)  
Position 3: C (✓)  
Position 4: T (✓)  
Position 5: H (✓)  

So the word is: _ U C T H

Letters still allowed for position 1: consonants not yet ruled out include F, G, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y.  
Valid English words fitting this pattern:  
- GUTCH (G is allowed)  
- MUCKT (invalid)  
- PUCKT (invalid)  
- FUCTH (invalid)  
- JUCKT (invalid)  
- WUCKT (invalid)  
- YUCKT (invalid)  

The only valid word is GUTCH, but G has not been ruled out yet.  
Therefore, the next logical guess is GUTCH.
