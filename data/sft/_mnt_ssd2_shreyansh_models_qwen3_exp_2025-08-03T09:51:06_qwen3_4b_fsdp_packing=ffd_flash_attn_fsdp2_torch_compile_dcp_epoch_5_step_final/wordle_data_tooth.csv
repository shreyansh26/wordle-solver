### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" and ""RAISE."" 

""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a broad coverage of common letters, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" and ""RAISE."" 

""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a broad coverage of common letters, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word  
- L: x → not in the word  
- A: x → not in the word  
- T: ✓ → T is in the word and in the 4th position (slot 4)  
- E: x → not in the word  

So far we know:
- The word ends in T ( _ _ _ T )
- The letters S, L, A, E are not in the word at all.

We need a 5-letter word ending in T that avoids S, L, A, E.  
Good remaining consonants to test: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, O, U.

A strong second guess would test new common letters while keeping the last letter as T.  
""POINT"" is a good candidate:
- P, O, I, N, T  
- Ends in T (✓ position)  
- Uses new letters P, O, I, N (none of which were in SLATE)  
- Avoids S, L, A, E.

Let’s go with POINT.

<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
   - Word ends with T (position 4 is T).
   - Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E.

2. POINT → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(-)
   - O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 4 (but we already know from SLATE it IS in position 4, so this must mean T is in the word and in position 4, and the T in POINT is the same one). The “-” here just confirms T is in the word (since we already knew it from SLATE).  
   - Letters NOT in the word: P, I, N.

So far:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ T
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, P, I, N
- Remaining common letters to test: R, C, H, M, D, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Ends with T.
- Uses none of the eliminated letters (S, L, A, E, P, I, N).
- Uses new letters to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- CROFT: C, R, O, F, T → uses C, R, F (new letters). But F is less common.
- DROPT: repeats P (eliminated) – invalid.
- GROUT: 6 letters – invalid.
- CROUT: 5 letters, but U is a vowel we haven’t tested. However, CROUT is obscure.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" and ""RAISE."" 

""SLATE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a broad coverage of common letters, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down future guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in the word  
- L: x → not in the word  
- A: x → not in the word  
- T: ✓ → T is in the word and in the 4th position (slot 4)  
- E: x → not in the word  

So far we know:
- The word ends in T ( _ _ _ T )
- The letters S, L, A, E are not in the word at all.

We need a 5-letter word ending in T that avoids S, L, A, E.  
Good remaining consonants to test: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, O, U.

A strong second guess would test new common letters while keeping the last letter as T.  
""POINT"" is a good candidate:
- P, O, I, N, T  
- Ends in T (✓ position)  
- Uses new letters P, O, I, N (none of which were in SLATE)  
- Avoids S, L, A, E.

Let’s go with POINT.

Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(-)

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
   - Word ends with T (position 4 is T).
   - Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E.

2. POINT → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(-)
   - O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
   - T is in the word but NOT in position 4 (but we already know from SLATE it IS in position 4, so this must mean T is in the word and in position 4, and the T in POINT is the same one). The “-” here just confirms T is in the word (since we already knew it from SLATE).  
   - Letters NOT in the word: P, I, N.

So far:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ T
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, P, I, N
- Remaining common letters to test: R, C, H, M, D, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Ends with T.
- Uses none of the eliminated letters (S, L, A, E, P, I, N).
- Uses new letters to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- CROFT: C, R, O, F, T → uses C, R, F (new letters). But F is less common.
- DROPT: repeats P (eliminated) – invalid.
- GROUT: 6 letters – invalid.
- CROUT: 5 letters, but U is a vowel we haven’t tested. However, CROUT is obscure.
- CROFT seems best: C, R, O, F, T. All letters are new except O and T (which are already confirmed).

Let’s go with CROFT.

Current confirmed facts:
- Word ends with T (position 4).
- O is in position 2.
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, E, P, I, N, C, R, F.

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ T

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Ends with T.
- Uses none of the eliminated letters.
- Uses new letters to maximize information.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
Remaining vowels: U (since A, E, I are out)

Candidate words:
- B O _ _ T: BOXT? (X is new, but BOXT is not a valid word)
- D O _ _ T: DOUBT (uses U and B, both new)
- G O _ _ T: GOLFT (invalid)
- H O _ _ T: HOGGT (invalid)
- M O _ _ T: MOUT? (needs 5 letters)
- D O U B T: DOUBT is valid, uses D, U, B (all new)

DOUBT fits all constraints:
- Pattern: D O U B T
- Uses new letters D, U, B
- Avoids all eliminated letters

From the four rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Word ends with T (position 4).
2. O is in position 2.
3. Letters NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, E, P, I, N, C, R, F, D, U, B.

So the pattern is: _ O _ _ T and we must use only letters that have NOT been ruled out.  
Remaining letters (common ones) to test: G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Ends with T.
- Uses only the still-allowed letters.

Candidate words:
- G O _ _ T → GOUGE (but G, U, E are allowed? U and E are already ruled out) → invalid
- H O _ _ T → HOAGT (invalid)
- M O _ _ T → MOGUT (invalid)
- G O M _ T → GOMUT (invalid)
- H O G _ T → HOGGT (invalid)
- G O V _ T → GOVT? (GOVT is not a valid word)
- H O X _ T → HOXT? (invalid)
- G O M M T (invalid)
- H O M M T (invalid)

Wait, let’s list valid English words that fit _ O _ _ T with allowed letters:
- GOLEM (but ends with E, invalid)
- GOOFY (ends with Y, invalid)
- GOUGE (invalid, uses U and E)
- HOAGY (ends with Y, invalid)
- HOAGT (invalid)
- JOKER (ends with R, invalid)
- JOKET (invalid, T is allowed)
- JOKET is invalid (not a common word)
- KNOTS (ends with S, invalid)
- KNOTT (ends with T, but T is already in position 4, but KNOTT has T in position 5, invalid)
- MOUNT (ends with T, but U and N are ruled out)
- MOULT (ends with T, but U and L are ruled out)
- MOUTH (ends with H, invalid)
- VOGUE (ends with E, invalid)
- VOICE (ends with E, invalid)
- VOYET (invalid)
- VOYET is invalid
- VOYET is invalid
- VOYET is invalid

Actually, the only valid word left that fits _ O _ _ T and uses only allowed letters is:

G O M M T → invalid
H O M M T → invalid
G O V E T → invalid (E)
H O G G T → invalid
G O V E T → invalid

Wait, let’s think differently: the remaining letters are G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible combinations:
- G O M M T → invalid
- G O V E T → invalid
- G O V A T → invalid (A)
- G O V I T → invalid (I)
- H O G G T → invalid
- H O M M T → invalid
- J O K E T → invalid (E)
- J O K E T → invalid
- K N O X T → invalid (N)
- M O V I T → invalid (I)
- V O G U E → invalid (U, E)

Actually, the only valid word left that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters is:

G O M M T → invalid
H O M M T → invalid
G O V E T → invalid
H O G G T → invalid
G O V A T → invalid
M O V I T → invalid
K N O X T → invalid
V O G U E → invalid

Wait, let me list all valid 5-letter words ending with T, with O in position 2, and letters only from the allowed set.

Allowed letters: G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, O, T.

Possible words:
