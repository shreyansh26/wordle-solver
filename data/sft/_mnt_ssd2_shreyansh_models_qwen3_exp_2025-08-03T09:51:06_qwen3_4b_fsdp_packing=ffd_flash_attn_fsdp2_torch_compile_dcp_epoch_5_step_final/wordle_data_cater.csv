### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify vowels and consonants efficiently. The word ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains three common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: AROSE

T(-)  → T is in the word, but NOT in position 5  

Summary of what we know:
- Letters that must appear: A, R, E, C, T  (all five are confirmed “in the word”)
- Letters that must NOT appear: O, S
- Forbidden positions so far:
  – A cannot be 1st or 3rd  
  – R cannot be 2nd or 1st  
  – E cannot be 2nd or 5th  
  – C cannot be 4th  
  – T cannot be 5th  

We need a 5-letter permutation of A, R, E, C, T that satisfies all these constraints.

Let’s list the allowed positions for each letter:

A: allowed in 2nd, 4th, 5th  
R: allowed in 3rd, 4th, 5th  
E: allowed in 1st, 3rd, 4th  
C: allowed in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th  
T: allowed in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th  

A quick check of valid permutations:
- T A R E C → T(1st) allowed, A(2nd) allowed, R(3rd) allowed, E(4th) allowed, C(5th) allowed  
This satisfies every constraint.

From the new feedback on TARCE:

T(-) → T is in the word, but NOT in position 1  
A(✓) → A is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2)  
R(-) → R is in the word, but NOT in position 3  
C(-) → C is in the word, but NOT in position 4  
E(-) → E is in the word, but NOT in position 5  

Current confirmed facts:
- Letters that must appear: A, R, E, C, T  (all five are confirmed “in the word”)
- Letters that must NOT appear: O, S
- Positions so far:
  – A is fixed at position 2
  – T cannot be 1st
  – R cannot be 2nd (already 2nd is A) or 3rd  
  – C cannot be 4th  
  – E cannot be 2nd (already A) or 5th  

We need a 5-letter permutation of A, R, E, C, T with:
- A at position 2
- T not at position 1
- R not at 3rd
- C not at 4th
- E not at 5th

Let’s list possible arrangements with A fixed at position 2:

_ A _ _ _

We have to place R, E, C, T in positions 1,3,4,5 with constraints:
- T ≠ 1
- R ≠ 3
- C ≠ 4
- E ≠ 5

Possible positions for each:
- Position 1: cannot be T, can be R, E, C
- Position 3: cannot be R, can be T, E, C
- Position 4: cannot be C, can be T, R, E
- Position 5: cannot be E, can be T, R, C

Let’s try to build a valid permutation:

Option 1: Try C at 1, A at 2, E at 3, R at 4, T at 5 → C A E R T
Check constraints:
- T at 5: allowed (only forbidden at 1)
- R at 4: allowed (forbidden at 3,2,1)
- C at 1: allowed
- E at 3: allowed
- A at 2: fixed
This seems valid.

Another quick check: C A R E T
- R at 3: forbidden (R cannot be 3rd)
Reject.

Another: E A R C T
- T at 5: allowed
- R at 3: forbidden
Reject.

Another: R A C E T
- T at 5: allowed
- C at 3: allowed
- E at 4: allowed
- R at 1: allowed
This also seems valid.

Between C A E R T and R A C E T, let’s pick the first one (CAERT) as it uses C first.

But CAERT is not a valid English word. R A C E T is also invalid.

Wait, we need a valid 5-letter English word. Let’s reconsider.

Looking at valid permutations:
- C A R E T → invalid (not a word)
- C A T E R → CAT E R is valid
Check constraints:
- C at 1: allowed
- A at 2: fixed
- T at 3: allowed (forbidden at 1)
- E at 4: allowed (forbidden at 5)
- R at 5: allowed (forbidden at 3,2,1)
This is valid and a real word.

So the next guess is CATER.
