For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it uses 5 very common letters and covers vowels and consonants well.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: x → not in the word at all
- A: - → in the word but not in position 2
- I: x → not in the word
- S: x → not in the word
- E: - → in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S
- Letters definitely in the word: A and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively)

Next, I want to test new letters while keeping A and E in different positions. I also want to introduce common consonants like T, N, L, C, etc. A good candidate is “TALON”:
- T: new letter
- A: move to position 2 (since it can’t be in 2 from RAISE, but in this case A was in 2 and got “-” so actually A cannot be in 2. So maybe position 1 or 3 or 4)
Wait, in RAISE, A was in position 2 and got “-” meaning A is in the word but not in position 2. So A could be in 1,3,4,5.

Similarly, E was in position 5 and got “-” so E is in the word but not in position 5. So E could be in 1,2,3,4.

I need a word that:
- contains A and E
- does not contain R, I, S
- places A and E in new positions

Let me think of words with A and E not in positions 2 and 5 respectively. “TALON” has A in 2 which we already know is wrong for A. So scratch that.

How about “LEANT”?
- L: new
- E: position 1 (new)
- A: position 2 (but A can’t be in 2) → no good.

“PLATE”:
- P: new
- L: new
- A: position 2 (invalid)
→ no.

“LEAVE”:
- L: new
- E: position 1 (new)
- A: position 2 (invalid)
→ no.

“ALONE”:
- A: position 1 (valid)
- L: new
- O: new
- N: new
- E: position 5 (invalid, E can’t be in 5)
→ no.

“ANECD” (but not a valid word).

“CANOE”:
- C: new
- A: position 2 (invalid)

“EAGLE”:
- E: position 1 (valid)
- A: position 2 (invalid)

“ECLAT”:
- E: position 1 (valid)
- C: new
- L: new
- A: position 3 (valid)
- T: new
This seems good: contains A and E, new positions for them, and introduces new consonants.

Let me verify:
- E is in position 1 (was in 5 before, so new)
- A is in position 3 (was in 2 before, so new)
- Letters: E, C, L, A, T — none are R, I, S
This looks like a solid next guess.

From the new feedback on ECLAT:

E(-)  – E is in the word but NOT in position 1  
C(-)  – C is in the word but NOT in position 2  
L(x)  – L is NOT in the word  
A(-)  – A is in the word but NOT in position 4  
T(x)  – T is NOT in the word  

So far we know:

Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S, L, T  
Letters that ARE in the word (but whose exact positions are still unknown): A, E, C  

Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in 2, 4  
- E cannot be in 1, 5  
- C cannot be in 2  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, E, C (each at least once)  
2. Does NOT contain R, I, S, L, T  
3. Places A, E, C in positions that have not yet been ruled out for them  

Possible remaining positions:
- A can be in 1, 3, or 5  
- E can be in 2, 3, or 4  
- C can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5  

Let’s look for a word that fits these constraints. A good candidate is “ACE” plus two more consonants that haven’t been tried yet.  
Try “ACORN” – but it contains R and N (R is forbidden).  
Try “CACHE” – but it contains H and E is in position 5 (forbidden).  
Try “CAFE” – only 4 letters.  
Try “CAGED” – G and D are new, A is in 1 (allowed), C is in 2 (forbidden).  
Try “CAPED” – P and D are new, A is in 1 (allowed), C is in 2 (forbidden).  
Try “CEASE” – contains S (forbidden).  
Try “CAGED” already ruled out.  
Try “CAFFE” – not a valid word.  
Try “CAGED” again – C is in 2 (forbidden).  
Try “CAGED” – no.  
Try “CAGED” – no.  
Try “CAGED” – no.  
Let me think differently.  
We need a word with A, E, C and no R, I, S, L, T.  
Try “ACE” plus two more letters.  
“ACE” + D + G = “ACEDG” – invalid.  
“ACE” + D + M = “ACEDM” – invalid.  
“ACE” + N + D = “ACEND” – invalid.  
“ACE” + N + T – T is forbidden.  
“ACE” + N + G = “ACENG” – invalid.  
Let me list valid words with A, E, C and no forbidden letters.  
“ACE” + D + G – invalid.  
“ACE” + D + M – invalid.  
“ACE” + N + D – invalid.  
“ACE” + N + G – invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it uses 5 very common letters and covers vowels and consonants well.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: x → not in the word at all
- A: - → in the word but not in position 2
- I: x → not in the word
- S: x → not in the word
- E: - → in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S
- Letters definitely in the word: A and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively)

Next, I want to test new letters while keeping A and E in different positions. I also want to introduce common consonants like T, N, L, C, etc. A good candidate is “TALON”:
- T: new letter
- A: move to position 2 (since it can’t be in 2 from RAISE, but in this case A was in 2 and got “-” so actually A cannot be in 2. So maybe position 1 or 3 or 4)
Wait, in RAISE, A was in position 2 and got “-” meaning A is in the word but not in position 2. So A could be in 1,3,4,5.

Similarly, E was in position 5 and got “-” so E is in the word but not in position 5. So E could be in 1,2,3,4.

I need a word that:
- contains A and E
- does not contain R, I, S
- places A and E in new positions

Let me think of words with A and E not in positions 2 and 5 respectively. “TALON” has A in 2 which we already know is wrong for A. So scratch that.

How about “LEANT”?
- L: new
- E: position 1 (new)
- A: position 2 (but A can’t be in 2) → no good.

“PLATE”:
- P: new
- L: new
- A: position 2 (invalid)
→ no.

“LEAVE”:
- L: new
- E: position 1 (new)
- A: position 2 (invalid)
→ no.

“ALONE”:
- A: position 1 (valid)
- L: new
- O: new
- N: new
- E: position 5 (invalid, E can’t be in 5)
→ no.

“ANECD” (but not a valid word).

“CANOE”:
- C: new
- A: position 2 (invalid)
→ no.

“EAGLE”:
- E: position 1 (valid)
- A: position 2 (invalid)
→ no.

“ECLAT”:
- E: position 1 (valid)
- C: new
- L: new
- A: position 3 (valid)
- T: new
This seems good: contains A and E, new positions for them, and introduces new consonants.

Let me verify:
- E is in position 1 (was in 5 before, so new)
- A is in position 3 (was in 2 before, so new)
- Letters: E, C, L, A, T — none are R, I, S
This looks like a solid next guess.

- L: not in the word (x)
- A: in the word, but not in position 4 (-)
- T: not in the word (x)

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, I, S, L, T
- Letters definitely in the word: A, E, C
- Positions ruled out:
  – A cannot be in 2 or 4
  – E cannot be in 1 or 5
  – C cannot be in 2

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, E, C exactly once each
2. Does NOT contain R, I, S, L, T
3. Places A, E, C in allowed positions

Possible positions for each:
- A: 1, 3, 5
- E: 2, 3, 4
- C: 1, 3, 4, 5

Let’s try to build a valid word:

Option 1: A in 1, E in 2, C in 3
Word so far: A E C _ _
Need two more letters that are not R, I, S, L, T. Common remaining consonants: N, D, M, P, etc.

Try “ACE_N” – but we need a real word. “ACEID” is not valid.

Option 2: A in 3, E in 2, C in 4
Word so far: _ E A C _
Need two more letters. Try “MEACH” – invalid.

Option 3: A in 5, E in 2, C in 4
Word so far: _ E _ C A
Try “NECCA” – invalid.

Option 4: A in 3, E in 4, C in 1
Word so far: C _ A E _
Try “CRAZE” – contains R (invalid).

Option 5: A in 3, E in 4, C in 5
Word so far: _ _ A E C
Try “MACEC” – invalid.

Option 6: A in 1, E in 3, C in 4
Word so far: A _ A E C – duplicate A.

Option 7: A in 1, E in 4, C in 5
Word so far: A _ _ E C
Try “AN E C” – “AN E C” is not a word.

Option 8: A in 3, E in 2, C in 5
Word so far: _ E A _ C
Try “PEACH” – contains H (valid), and letters are P, E, A, C, H. Let’s check:
- Contains A, E, C – yes
- Does NOT contain R, I, S, L, T – yes
- Positions:
  – A is in 3 (allowed: not 2 or 4) ✓
  – E is in 2 (allowed: not 1 or 5) ✓
  – C is in 5 (allowed: not 2) ✓
- Other letters P and H are new and valid.

“PEACH” fits all constraints.

From the latest feedback on PEACH:
- P(x) → P is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 2.
- A(✓) → A is in the word and in position 3.
- C(✓) → C is in the word and in position 4.
- H(✓) → H is in the word and in position 5.

So the secret word has the pattern:
_ E A C H

We only need to determine the first letter. It must be a letter that has not been ruled out yet. From earlier guesses, we know the word does NOT contain R, I, S, L, T, or P. The first letter must be a consonant that hasn't been used or excluded.

Possible first letters (common ones not excluded): B, D, F, G, K, M, N, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ E A C H:
- BEACH (B is allowed)
- DEACH (not a valid word)
- FEACH (not valid)
- GEACH (not valid)
- MEACH (not valid)
- NEACH (not valid)
- WEACH (not valid)

The only valid word is BEACH. Let's confirm:
- B has not been excluded.
- E, A, C, H are in their correct positions.
- No excluded letters are used.

Therefore, the next guess should be BEACH.
