1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, U, I. A good first guess should use several of these letters to quickly identify which are present or absent in the secret word.

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants that frequently appear in 5-letter words. It will help us quickly eliminate or confirm several letters in the secret word.

So far we know:

- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I.
- Letters that ARE in the word (but whose positions we still don’t know): E (and it is NOT in positions 4 or 5).
- Remaining common letters that we have not tried yet: L, C, D, G, H, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a word that:
1. Contains E, and E must be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since positions 4 and 5 are ruled out).
2. Uses only letters that have not yet been ruled out.
3. Uses common letters to maximize information gain.

A good candidate is “CHEEP”:
- Contains E in position 2.
- Uses C, H, P (all still possible).
- Has a common vowel (E) and two new consonants (C, P) plus a second E to test if double letters are involved.

However, “CHEEP” has two E’s, which might not be optimal for gaining new information. A better choice is “CLEDE”:
- Contains E in position 1 (which is still possible).
- Uses C, L, D (all still possible).
- Has a single E in position 1.

But “CLEDE” is less common. A more common word that fits the constraints is “ELDER”:
- Contains E in position 1.
- Uses L, D, R (but R was already ruled out in Guess 1). So this is invalid.

Next candidate: “GELID”:
- Contains E in position 1.
- Uses G, L, I, D (but I was ruled out in Guess 2). Invalid.

Next: “PEELS”:
- Contains E in position 1 and 4 (but position 4 is ruled out for E). Invalid.

Next: “MELON”:

- Uses M, L, O, N (but O and N are ruled out). Invalid.

Next: “HELIX”:

Next: “PELIC”:

- Uses P, L, I, C (but I is ruled out). Invalid.

Next: “DECKS”:
- Contains E in position 1.
- Uses D, C, K, S (but S is ruled out). Invalid.

Next: “PECKY”:
- Contains E in position 1.
- Uses P, C, K, Y (all still possible).

This seems like a good choice:
- E in position 1 (valid).
- Uses P, C, K, Y (none ruled out).
- Common letters to maximize information.

Thus, the next guess is “PECKY”.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, U, I. A good first guess should use several of these letters to quickly identify which are present or absent in the secret word.\n\nLooking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:\n- A (very common vowel)\n- R (common consonant)\n- O (common vowel)\n- S (common consonant)\n- E (most common letter in English)\n\nThis combination gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants that frequently appear in 5-letter words.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, C, K, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word (but we still don’t know their exact positions):  
- E (from arose and untie and pecky) – never yet in position 4 or 5, and now also not in position 2.  
  So E must be in position 1 or 3.  
- P (from pecky) – appears as “-” (in the word, wrong place), so P exists but not in position 1.  
  Therefore P must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Remaining common letters we have not tried: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, V, W, X, Z  
We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both E and P.  
2. Places E in position 1 or 3.  
3. Places P somewhere other than position 1.  
4. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.

Possible candidates:
- If E is in position 1: “EP…” but no common words fit.  
- If E is in position 3: “_ _ E _ _” with P in 2, 4, or 5.

Let’s try “BREAD” – but A, R, D are all ruled out or not confirmed.  
Try “BEVEL” – but V, L are new, B, E, V, E, L – E appears twice, but we don’t know if E repeats.  
Try “BLEEP” – has two E’s and P, but L, B are new, and P is in position 5 (allowed).  
Check letters: B, L, E, E, P – all allowed so far.  
Positions: E is in 3 (allowed), P is in 5 (allowed).  
This seems valid and gives us new letters B and L plus tests double E.

Another candidate: “PEBBY” – but Y is ruled out.  
“PEVET” – V, T, T – but T is ruled out.  
“PELLE” – L is new, but E repeats.  
“BLEEP” is the cleanest choice here.

So the next guess is “BLEEP”.
