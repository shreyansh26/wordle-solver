### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify potential vowels and consonants in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This will help me quickly narrow down which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.

- Vowels present: O and E (but O not in position 3, E not in position 5)
- Consonants not present: A, R, S
- We need a 5-letter word that uses O and E, and avoids A, R, S.

Good letters to try next: common consonants like T, L, N, C, D, M, P, etc., and the vowels I, U.

A strong candidate is “TOILE”:
- T is a common consonant.
- O is in position 2 (not 3, satisfying the feedback).
- I is a common vowel.
- L is a common consonant.
- E is in position 4 (not 5, satisfying the feedback).

  – O is not in position 3 (from AROSE) and not in position 2 (from TOILE).

Among vowels, U is still available (A, I are out, O and E are in).

We want a word that:
1. Contains both O and E.  
2. Places O somewhere other than positions 2 or 3.  
3. Places E somewhere other than position 5.  
4. Uses only the remaining letters.

Positions ruled out for O: 1, 2, 3.

Therefore:
- O must be in position 4 or 5.  
- E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
- We still need three more letters, none of which are any of the ruled-out letters.

Remaining common consonants: C, D, F, H, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, etc.  
Remaining vowels: U (since A, I are out, O and E are already used).

Let’s try a word that places O in position 4 and E in position 2, using new consonants:

Candidate: “DOUCE”  
- D, C, U are new letters.  
- O is in position 4 (allowed).  
- E is in position 5 → but E cannot be in position 5 (from feedback).

Invalid.

Next: “MOUND” – but we need 5 letters and must include O and E.

O must be in 4 or 5.  
E must be in 1, 2, or 3 (since 5 is ruled out).

Let’s try O in position 4 and E in position 1,2, or 3:

Possible patterns:
E _ _ O _  (O in 4, E in 1) – but E can’t be in 5, so 1 is allowed.
_ E _ O _  (E in 2)
_ _ E O _  (E in 3)

We need to fill the remaining slots with new consonants.

Let’s pick “DEMON” – but we need to check letters: D, E, M, O, N.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify potential vowels and consonants in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This will help me quickly narrow down which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Vowels present: O and E (but O not in position 3, E not in position 5)
- Consonants not present: A, R, S
- We need a 5-letter word that uses O and E, and avoids A, R, S.

Good letters to try next: common consonants like T, L, N, C, D, M, P, etc., and the vowels I, U.

A strong candidate is “TOILE”:
- T is a common consonant.
- O is in position 2 (not 3, satisfying the feedback).
- I is a common vowel.
- L is a common consonant.
- E is in position 4 (not 5, satisfying the feedback).

This should give us more information about positions and potentially new letters.

What we now know for sure:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, T, I, L  
- Letters that ARE in the word, but whose positions we still don’t know: O and E  
  – O is not in position 3 (from AROSE) and not in position 2 (from TOILE).  
  – E is not in position 5 (from AROSE) and not in position 5 (from TOILE) — so E is definitely NOT in position 5.

We still need three more letters. The remaining common consonants are B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.  
Among vowels, U is still available (A, I are out, O and E are in).

We want a word that:
1. Contains both O and E.  
2. Places O somewhere other than positions 2 or 3.  
3. Places E somewhere other than position 5.  
4. Uses only the remaining letters.

A good candidate is “BOGEY”:
- B: new consonant.  
- O: appears, and can sit in position 1 or 4 (neither is forbidden).  
- G: new consonant.  
- E: appears, and can sit in position 4 (allowed).

This tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

We need to place M and N in the remaining positions (1, 3, or 5), but:
- N cannot be in position 5 (from demon feedback).
- M cannot be in position 3 (from demon feedback).

Therefore possible positions:
- Position 1: M or N
- Position 3: M or N
- Position 5: M or N (but N is excluded, so only M)

But position 5 cannot be N, and M cannot be in position 3, so M must be in position 5, and N must be in position 1 or 3.

Let's try:
- Position 1: N
- Position 3: M

This gives: N E M O _  
We need a fifth letter for position 5. Remaining letters: C, F, H, K, P, U, V, W.

Looking for common letters, let's try ""F"" to make ""NEMOF"" – but ""NEMOF"" isn't a valid word.

Next, try ""H"" to make ""NEMOH"" – also invalid.

Next, try ""K"" to make ""NEMOK"" – invalid.

Next, try ""P"" to make ""NEMOP"" – invalid.

Next, try ""U"" to make ""NEMOU"" – invalid.

Next, try ""V"" to make ""NEMOV"" – invalid.

Next, try ""W"" to make ""NEMOW"" – invalid.

This path doesn't seem to work. Let's try N in position 3 and M in position 5:
_ E N O M

This gives: _ E N O M  
We need a first letter. Remaining consonants: C, F, H, K, P, U, V, W.

Valid words:
- C: CENOM – invalid
- F: FENOM – invalid
- H: HENOM – invalid
- K: KENOM – invalid
- P: PENOM – invalid
- U: UENOM – invalid
- V: VENOM – valid word!

""VENOM"" fits:
- V is new (not ruled out)
- E is in position 2 (matches ✓)
- N is in position 3 (allowed, since N only can't be in 5)
- O is in position 4 (matches ✓)
- M is in position 5 (allowed, since M only can't be in 3)

Check letters: V, E, N, O, M – none are ruled out.

Therefore, the next guess is VENOM.

<guess>venom</guess>",venom,"From the feedback so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)  
   – O and E are in the word, but positions unknown.

2. toile → T(x) O(-) I(x) L(x) E(-)  
   – O is not in position 2, E is not in position 5.

3. bogye → B(x) O(-) G(x) Y(x) E(-)  
   – O is not in position 1, E is still not in position 5.

4. demon → D(x) E(✓) M(-) O(✓) N(-)  
   – E is in position 2 (✓)  
   – O is in position 4 (✓)  
   – M is in the word but not in position 3  
   – N is in the word but not in position 5

So the word pattern now is:
_ E _ O _  
with the additional constraints that M and N are somewhere in the word (but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively).

Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, T, I, L, B, G, Y, D.

Remaining letters to use: C, F, H, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, etc.
