Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that will give us maximum information. The best strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. 

Looking at common letters in English words, the most frequent vowels are A, E, I, O, U and common consonants are R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should contain several of these letters.

Some good first guesses include:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose AROSE as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should help narrow down the possibilities quickly.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the three guesses.

Letters that ARE in the word (all have appeared with “-” or “✓”):
- A (✓ in slot 2)  
- R (all three appearances were “-”, so R is in the word but not in slot 1, 2, or 3)  
- E (all three appearances were “-”, so E is in the word but not in slot 1, 2, or 5)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- O, S, C, T, L, Y

So the word must contain A, R, E exactly once each, and two additional letters chosen from the remaining common consonants that have not been tested yet.  
Remaining consonants we haven’t tried: N, D, G, M, P, B, F, H, K, etc.

Position constraints:
- A is fixed in slot 2.  
- R cannot be in slots 1, 2, or 3.  Therefore R must be in slot 4 or 5.  
- E cannot be in slots 1, 2, or 5.  Therefore E must be in slot 3 or 4.  
  However, slot 4 is also available for R, so we need to test both placements.

Let’s list the possible positions:
- Slot 1: must be a new consonant (not A, E, R)  
- Slot 2: A (fixed)  
- Slot 3: could be E or a new consonant  
- Slot 4: could be R or E  
- Slot 5: could be R or E (but E cannot be here)

Let’s try to build a word that satisfies these constraints.  
A good candidate is “DREAD”:
- D (new consonant)  
- R (slot 1, but R cannot be in slot 1) – invalid.

Next candidate: “GRAPE” – but P and G are untested, but E would be in slot 5 which is invalid.

Next: “RANGE” – but R in slot 1 is invalid.

Next: “MARE” – but only 4 letters.

Next: “BARE” – but only 4 letters.

Next: “FARER” – but R is repeated and E cannot be in slot 5.

Next: “PAPER” – but P is new, A in slot 2, E in slot 3, R in slot 4 and 5 – but R cannot be in slot 1, 2, or 3, so slot 4 is okay, but R is repeated which may not be allowed (words usually have distinct letters).

Let’s try “GARRE” – invalid (R repeated).

Let’s try “FARER” – invalid (R repeated).

Let’s try “DRAPE” – but E in slot 5 is invalid.

Let’s try “MARE” – too short.

Check constraints:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that will give us maximum information. The best strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. 

Looking at common letters in English words, the most frequent vowels are A, E, I, O, U and common consonants are R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should contain several of these letters.

Some good first guesses include:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose AROSE as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should help narrow down the possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2  
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word  
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word  
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5  

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, E  
- Does NOT contain O or S  
- A is not in slot 1, R is not in slot 2, E is not in slot 5  

We now want a new guess that:
1. Uses A, R, E in different positions  
2. Avoids O and S  
3. Introduces other common consonants to test new letters  

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, M, P, etc.

A candidate word that satisfies these constraints is “TRANE”:
- T (new consonant)  
- R (must be used, move from slot 2 to slot 2 is still slot 2, but feedback said R is not in slot 2, so TRANE is bad because R would stay in slot 2)  
Wait, R is in slot 2 in TRANE, but feedback said R is not in slot 2. So TRANE is invalid.

Next candidate: “REACT”
- R in slot 1 (allowed, since feedback only said R is not in slot 2)  
- E in slot 2 (allowed, since feedback only said E is not in slot 5)  
- A in slot 3 (allowed, since feedback only said A is not in slot 1)  
- C (new consonant)

This seems good. It uses A, R, E in new positions and introduces C and T.

Let’s summarize everything we now know after four guesses.

Letters that ARE in the word (each has appeared with “-” or “✓”):
- A (✓ in slot 2)  
- R (all appearances so far were “-”, so R is in the word but not in slots 1, 2, 3, or 4)  
- E (all appearances so far were “-”, so E is in the word but not in slots 1, 2, 5)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- O, S, C, T, L, Y, B, D

Therefore the word must contain A, R, E exactly once each, and two additional letters chosen from the remaining unused consonants.  
Remaining consonants we have not tried yet: F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Position constraints:
- A is fixed in slot 2.  
- R cannot be in slots 1, 2, 3, or 4 → the only remaining slot for R is slot 5.  
- E cannot be in slots 1, 2, or 5 → the only remaining slots for E are 3 or 4.

So the word structure must be:
Slot 1: new consonant (not A, E, R)  
Slot 2: A  
Slot 3: E or new consonant  
Slot 4: E or new consonant  
Slot 5: R  

Let’s list the possible combinations for slots 3 and 4:
Case 1: E in slot 3, new consonant in slot 4  
Case 2: new consonant in slot 3, E in slot 4  

We need to pick two distinct new consonants for these cases.

Case 1: E A _ R  
We need a consonant for slot 4.  Valid choices: F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
A good candidate is “FEAR” – but that’s only 4 letters.  
A valid 5-letter word is “FEARE” – but that repeats E, which is already present once.  
Another candidate: “G A E R” – but that’s 4 letters.  
A valid word: “GAER” – too short.  
Actually, we need a 5-letter word with structure _ A E _ R.  
Example: “FAKER” – but K is new, F is new.  
Check letters: F, A, E, K, R.  
All are allowed (F and K have not been used yet).  
“FAKER” fits the pattern and uses two new consonants F and K.

Case 2: _ A _ E R  
Example: “G A M E R” – but that’s 5 letters: G, A, M, E, R.  
All letters are allowed (G and M are new).  
“GAMER” is a valid word.

Between “FAKER” and “GAMER”, both are valid.  
Let’s choose “GAMER”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that will give us maximum information. The best strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. 

Looking at common letters in English words, the most frequent vowels are A, E, I, O, U and common consonants are R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should contain several of these letters.

Some good first guesses include:
- AROSE (contains A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose AROSE as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should help narrow down the possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2  
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word  
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word  
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5  

So the secret word:
- Contains A, R, E  
- Does NOT contain O or S  
- A is not in slot 1, R is not in slot 2, E is not in slot 5  

We now want a new guess that:
1. Uses A, R, E in different positions  
2. Avoids O and S  
3. Introduces other common consonants to test new letters  

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, M, P, etc.

A candidate word that satisfies these constraints is “TRANE”:
- T (new consonant)  
- R (must be used, move from slot 2 to slot 2 is still slot 2, but feedback said R is not in slot 2, so TRANE is bad because R would stay in slot 2)  
Wait, R is in slot 2 in TRANE, but feedback said R is not in slot 2. So TRANE is invalid.

Next candidate: “REACT”
- R in slot 1 (allowed, since feedback only said R is not in slot 2)  
- E in slot 2 (allowed, since feedback only said E is not in slot 5)  
- A in slot 3 (allowed, since feedback only said A is not in slot 1)  
- C (new consonant)  
- T (new consonant)  

This seems good. It uses A, R, E in new positions and introduces C and T.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are in the word: A, R, E  
   (they all showed “-”, i.e., present but in wrong spots).

2. Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S, C, T.

3. Position constraints:
   - A is NOT in slot 1 (from AROSE) and NOT in slot 3 (from REACT)  
   - R is NOT in slot 2 (from AROSE) and NOT in slot 1 (from REACT)  
   - E is NOT in slot 5 (from AROSE) and NOT in slot 2 (from REACT)

We still need to place A, R, E in the remaining slots while introducing new consonants.  
Common remaining consonants to test: N, L, D, G, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- uses A, R, E in positions that satisfy the constraints  
- introduces new consonants in the remaining two slots

A promising candidate is “EARLY”:
- E in slot 1 (allowed)  
- A in slot 2 (allowed)  
- R in slot 3 (allowed)  
- L (new consonant)  
- Y (new consonant)

This satisfies every constraint so far.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the three guesses.

Letters that ARE in the word (all have appeared with “-” or “✓”):
- A (✓ in slot 2)  
- R (all three appearances were “-”, so R is in the word but not in slot 1, 2, or 3)  
- E (all three appearances were “-”, so E is in the word but not in slot 1, 2, or 5)

Letters that are NOT in the word:
- O, S, C, T, L, Y

So the word must contain A, R, E exactly once each, and two additional letters chosen from the remaining common consonants that have not been tested yet.  
Remaining consonants we haven’t tried: N, D, G, M, P, B, F, H, K, etc.

Position constraints:
- A is fixed in slot 2.  
- R cannot be in slots 1, 2, or 3.  Therefore R must be in slot 4 or 5.  
- E cannot be in slots 1, 2, or 5.  Therefore E must be in slot 3 or 4.  
  However, slot 4 is also available for R, so we need to test both placements.

Let’s list the possible positions:
- Slot 1: must be a new consonant (not A, E, R)  
- Slot 2: A (fixed)  
- Slot 3: could be E or a new consonant  
- Slot 4: could be R or E  
- Slot 5: could be R or E (but E cannot be here)

Let’s try to build a word that satisfies these constraints.  
A good candidate is “DREAD”:
- D (new consonant)  
- R (slot 1, but R cannot be in slot 1) – invalid.

Next candidate: “GRAPE” – but P and G are untested, but E would be in slot 5 which is invalid.

Next: “RANGE” – but R in slot 1 is invalid.

Next: “MARE” – but only 4 letters.

Next: “BARE” – but only 4 letters.

Next: “FARER” – but R is repeated and E cannot be in slot 5.

Next: “PAPER” – but P is new, A in slot 2, E in slot 3, R in slot 4 and 5 – but R cannot be in slot 1, 2, or 3, so slot 4 is okay, but R is repeated which may not be allowed (words usually have distinct letters).

Let’s try “GARRE” – invalid (R repeated).

Let’s try “FARER” – invalid (R repeated).

Let’s try “DRAPE” – but E in slot 5 is invalid.

Let’s try “MARE” – too short.

Let’s try “BRAER” – invalid.

Let’s try “NARRE” – invalid.

Let’s try “DRAPE” – invalid.

Let’s try “PARE” – too short.

Let’s try “FRAER” – invalid.

Let’s try “GARE” – too short.

Let’s try “DARE” – too short.

Let’s try “CARE” – but C is invalid.

Let’s try “HARE” – too short.

Let’s try “IARE” – invalid.

Let’s try “VARE” – invalid.

Let’s try “WATER” – but T is invalid.

Let’s try “BREAD” – but E would be in slot 3, R in slot 4, A in slot 2, B and D new.  
Check constraints:
- B (new)  
- R in slot 4 (allowed)  
- E in slot 3 (allowed)  
- A in slot 2 (fixed)  
- D (new)  

This satisfies all constraints.

From Guess 5 (GAMER) we now have:

- G(x) → G is NOT in the word.  
- A(✓) → A is in the word and is fixed in slot 2.  
- M(x) → M is NOT in the word.  
- E(✓) → E is in the word and is fixed in slot 4.  
- R(✓) → R is in the word and is fixed in slot 5.

So the confirmed structure is:

Slot 1: ? (must be a letter not yet ruled out)  
Slot 2: A  
Slot 3: ? (must be a letter not yet ruled out)  
Slot 4: E  
Slot 5: R  

Letters already ruled out: O, S, C, T, L, Y, B, D, G, M.  
Letters already used (and thus must appear once each): A, E, R.

We need two new letters for slots 1 and 3, chosen from the remaining unused alphabet.  
Remaining consonants: F, H, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.  
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A and E are already placed).

A common 5-letter word that fits _ A _ E R is “FAKER”, but K is allowed and F is allowed.  
However, K was not used yet and F was not used yet.  
But let’s check if there’s a word that uses a vowel in slot 3.  
The only vowel left is I or U.  
Possible words:  
- “PAIER” – but I is a vowel and A is already in slot 2.  
- “VAIER” – not a valid word.  
- “HAVER” – H, A, V, E, R – all allowed.  
- “NAVER” – N, A, V, E, R – all allowed.  
- “PAVER” – P, A, V, E, R – all allowed.  
- “WAVER” – W, A, V, E, R – all allowed.  
- “FAVER” – F, A, V, E, R – all allowed.  

Among these, “NAVER” is a valid English word (past tense of “navel”).  
Let’s choose “NAVER”.
