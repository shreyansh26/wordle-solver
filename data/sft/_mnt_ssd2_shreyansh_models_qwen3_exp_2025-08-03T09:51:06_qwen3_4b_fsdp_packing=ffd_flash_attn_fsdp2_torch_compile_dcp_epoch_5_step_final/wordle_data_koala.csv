For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help me identify vowels and consonants efficiently. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good first guess because it contains:
- S: common consonant
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common vowel

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter (✓) or knowing which letters are present (-) or absent (x). Other good options might be ""AROSE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""SLATE"" seems balanced.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess to maximize information gain.

- The word contains L somewhere other than position 2.
- It does NOT contain S, T, or E.

We still need to test consonants and other vowels. A good second guess should incorporate L in a different spot and introduce new common letters. “PLAID” comes to mind because:
- It keeps A in position 3.
- Moves L to position 2 (since we know L is in the word but not in position 2, this tests a new spot).
- Introduces P, I, D – all new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Let’s summarize everything we now know.

1. Position 3 is definitely A.

Remaining common consonants: N, C, M, B, F, H, K, V, W, Z.

Try to fill with new letters. A good candidate is “BALMY” but Y and M are allowed, but Y is already ruled out. Next: “CALM” – too short. “CALM” needs extension. “CABLE” – E is ruled out. “CABLE” invalid.

Next idea: “FACED” – E and D ruled out. “FACED” invalid.

Next: “CULPA” – but U is allowed, P ruled out. “CULPA” invalid.

Next: “HUMAL” – but H, U, M, A, L. A is correct, L is in position 5 (allowed). H, U, M are new and not ruled out. This seems valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help me identify vowels and consonants efficiently. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good first guess because it contains:
- S: common consonant
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common vowel

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter (✓) or knowing which letters are present (-) or absent (x). Other good options might be ""AROSE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""SLATE"" seems balanced.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess to maximize information gain.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in position 3.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Position 3 is A.
- The word contains L somewhere other than position 2.
- It does NOT contain S, T, or E.

We still need to test consonants and other vowels. A good second guess should incorporate L in a different spot and introduce new common letters. “PLAID” comes to mind because:
- It keeps A in position 3.
- Moves L to position 2 (since we know L is in the word but not in position 2, this tests a new spot).
- Introduces P, I, D – all new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters while respecting the constraints we have.

So far we know:
- Position 3 is definitely A.
- The word contains L, but L is NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from SLATE and PLAID).
- Letters NOT in the word: S, T, E, P, I, D.

We still need to place L somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5) and fill the other slots with letters we haven’t ruled out. Common consonants left: R, N, C, M, G, B, F, H, K, etc. Common vowels left: O, U (since A is already used).

A good next guess should:
1. Keep A in position 3.
2. Place L in a new position (1, 4, or 5).
3. Introduce new, common letters.

Let’s try “CLAMP”:
- C, M, P are new letters (but P is already ruled out, so skip).
Next idea: “GLOAM” – but O and M are new, and L in position 2 is ruled out.
Better: “BLOAT” – but T is ruled out.
Next: “CLOAK” – K is new, C and K are good.
- C in position 1, L in position 2 (but L can’t be in 2), so skip.
Next: “CLOUD” – D is ruled out.
Next: “GROAN” – but N is new, G, R, O are new, A is correct, but L is missing.
We must include L somewhere.

Let’s try “GALAX” – but X is uncommon.
Better: “GLAND” – D is ruled out.
Next: “GLORY” – Y is new, G, R, O are new, L in position 1 (allowed).
- G, R, O, Y are new letters.
- L is in position 1 (not ruled out).
This seems good.

Let’s re-express the feedback step by step.

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
   - Position 3 is A.
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2.

2. PLAID → P(x) L(-) A(✓) I(x) D(x)
   - Confirms A in position 3.
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (already known) nor position 3 (which is A).

3. GLORY → G(x) L(-) O(-) R(x) Y(x)
   - L is NOT in position 1.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (which is A).

4. BANAL → B(x) A(-) N(x) A(-) L(-)
   - A is NOT in positions 2 or 4 (since both A’s got “-”).
   - L is NOT in position 5 (since L got “-”).

So far we know:
- Position 3 is A.
- L must be in position 4 (only remaining spot).
- O is somewhere in the word (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5), but not 3.
- Letters NOT in the word: S, T, E, P, I, D, G, R, Y, B, N.

Remaining consonants: C, F, H, K, M, V, W, Z.
Remaining vowels: U (since A and O are accounted for).

Word pattern so far:
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: L
- O must appear once in positions 1, 2, or 5.

Possible patterns:
- O _ A L _

We need to fill the blanks with letters from the remaining pool: C, F, H, K, M, V, W, Z, U.

Let’s try O _ A L _:
- O C A L _ → “OCA” is not a prefix. “OCAL” is not a word.
- O F A L _ → “OFAL” is archaic (a type of fish), but “OFAL” is 4 letters.
- O H A L _ → “OHAL” not a word.
- O K A L _ → “OKAL” not a word.
- O M A L _ → “OMAL” not a word.
- O V A L _ → “OVAL” is a 4-letter word, but we need 5.
- O W A L _ → “OWAL” not a word.

Next pattern: _ O A L _

- K O A L _ → “KOAL” not a word.
- M O A L _ → “MOAL” not a word.
- V O A L _ → “VOAL” not a word.
- W O A L _ → “WOAL” not a word.

Next pattern: _ _ A L O
- C H A L O → “CHALO” not a word.
- C K A L O → “CKALO” invalid.
- F U A L O → “FUALO” invalid.
- H U A L O → “HUALO” invalid.
- M U A L O → “MUALO” invalid.
- W U A L O → “WUALO” invalid.

Wait, let’s try more systematically with valid 5-letter words.

We need:
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: L
- O must appear once in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- Other letters from: C, F, H, K, M, V, W, Z, U.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words matching these constraints.

Possible candidates:
- C O A L _ → “COAL” is 4 letters.
- F O A L _ → “FOAL” is 4 letters.
- M O A L _ → “MOAL” is 4 letters.
- C H A L O → “CHALO” invalid.
- C U A L O → “CUALO” invalid.
- F U A L O → “FUALO” invalid.
- H U A L O → “HUALO” invalid.
- M U A L O → “MUALO” invalid.
- W U A L O → “WUALO” invalid.

Wait, let’s think of actual words with A in position 3, L in position 4, and O somewhere else.

Example: “C O A L _” – but we need 5 letters. “COALA” – but A is already in position 3.

Actually, the word must be:
- _ _ A L _ with O in one of the blanks.

Let’s list valid words:
- “C O A L _” – no 5-letter word.
- “F O A L _” – no 5-letter word.
- “M O A L _” – no 5-letter word.
- “C H A L O” – invalid.
- “C U A L O” – invalid.
- “F U A L O” – invalid.
- “H U A L O” – invalid.
- “M U A L O” – invalid.
- “W U A L O” – invalid.

Hmm, maybe I missed some. Let’s try with U.

Pattern: _ _ A L O
- C H A L O – invalid.
- C U A L O – invalid.
- F U A L O – invalid.
- M U A L O – invalid.
- W U A L O – invalid.

Wait, let’s try “C O A L _” with a valid 5-letter word: “COALA” – but A is already in position 3, and we have two A’s. The feedback for BANAL showed A(-) in positions 2 and 4, meaning A is not in those positions, but it could be repeated elsewhere. However, the word is 5 letters, and position 3 is A, so it could have another A. Let me check:

“COALA”:
- C O A L A
- Position 3: A (correct)
- Position 4: L (correct)
- O in position 2 (allowed)
- Letters: C, O, A, L, A – all allowed (C, O, L are not ruled out; A is allowed in position 5).

This seems valid.

Another candidate: “FOCAL”:
- F O C A L
- Position 3: A (correct)
- Position 4: L (correct)
- O in position 2 (allowed)
- Letters: F, O, C, A, L – all allowed.

This is a valid word.

Between COALA and FOCAL, FOCAL is more common.

So I’ll guess “FOCAL”.

From the feedback we now know:
- Position 3 is A.
- Position 4 is L (only remaining spot for L).
- O must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- Remaining letters to use: C, F, H, K, M, V, W, Z, U.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help me identify vowels and consonants efficiently. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a good first guess because it contains:
- S: common consonant
- L: common consonant
- A: common vowel
- T: common consonant
- E: most common vowel

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one correct letter (✓) or knowing which letters are present (-) or absent (x). Other good options might be ""AROSE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""SLATE"" seems balanced.

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess to maximize information gain.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in position 3.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Position 3 is A.
- The word contains L somewhere other than position 2.
- It does NOT contain S, T, or E.

We still need to test consonants and other vowels. A good second guess should incorporate L in a different spot and introduce new common letters. “PLAID” comes to mind because:
- It keeps A in position 3.
- Moves L to position 2 (since we know L is in the word but not in position 2, this tests a new spot).
- Introduces P, I, D – all new letters that haven’t been tested yet.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters while respecting the constraints we have.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAID -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(-) A(✓) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
So far we know:
- Position 3 is definitely A.
- The word contains L, but L is NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from SLATE and PLAID).
- Letters NOT in the word: S, T, E, P, I, D.

We still need to place L somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5) and fill the other slots with letters we haven’t ruled out. Common consonants left: R, N, C, M, G, B, F, H, K, etc. Common vowels left: O, U (since A is already used).

A good next guess should:
1. Keep A in position 3.
2. Place L in a new position (1, 4, or 5).
3. Introduce new, common letters.

Let’s try “CLAMP”:
- C, M, P are new letters (but P is already ruled out, so skip).
Next idea: “GLOAM” – but O and M are new, and L in position 2 is ruled out.
Better: “BLOAT” – but T is ruled out.
Next: “CLOAK” – K is new, C and K are good.
- C in position 1, L in position 2 (but L can’t be in 2), so skip.
Next: “CLOUD” – D is ruled out.
Next: “GROAN” – but N is new, G, R, O are new, A is correct, but L is missing.
We must include L somewhere.

Let’s try “GALAX” – but X is uncommon.
Better: “GLAND” – D is ruled out.
Next: “GLORY” – Y is new, G, R, O are new, L in position 1 (allowed).
- G, R, O, Y are new letters.
- L is in position 1 (not ruled out).
This seems good.

So I’ll guess “GLORY”.

Guess 3: GLORY -> FEEDBACK: G(x) L(-) O(-) R(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s summarize everything we now know.

1. Position 3 is definitely A.
2. The word contains L, but L is NOT in positions 2, 3, or 1 (from SLATE, PLAID, GLORY).
   - Therefore L must be in position 4 or 5.
3. Letters NOT in the word: S, T, E, P, I, D, G, R, Y, O.

Remaining common consonants: N, C, M, B, F, H, K, V, W, Z.
Remaining common vowels: U (A is already placed).

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A fixed in position 3.
- L in position 4 or 5.
- All other letters must be from the remaining pool.

Let’s list possibilities:
- If L is in position 4: _ _ A L _
- If L is in position 5: _ _ A _ L

Try to fill with new letters. A good candidate is “BALMY” but Y and M are allowed, but Y is already ruled out. Next: “CALM” – too short. “CALM” needs extension. “CABLE” – E is ruled out. “CABLE” invalid.

Next idea: “FACED” – E and D ruled out. “FACED” invalid.

Next: “CULPA” – but U is allowed, P ruled out. “CULPA” invalid.

Next: “HUMAL” – but H, U, M, A, L. A is correct, L is in position 5 (allowed). H, U, M are new and not ruled out. This seems valid.

But “HUMAL” isn’t a common word. Better to use common words.

Next: “MURAL” – R ruled out. “MURAL” invalid.

Next: “CULM” – too short.

Next: “WALDO” – O ruled out.

Next: “BULK” – too short.

Next: “CUBAL” – not a word.

Next: “FACIAL” – too long.

Next: “MURAL” already invalid.

Next: “CULM” invalid.

Next: “CULM” invalid.

Next: “CULM” invalid.

Wait, let’s systematically try:

We need:
- Position 3: A
- L in 4 or 5
- Other letters from remaining: B, C, F, H, K, M, N, V, W, Z, U.

Let’s try L in position 5: _ _ A _ L

Possible: “BANAL” – N is new, B is new. BANAL is a valid word.

Check letters:
- B: new
- A: correct
- N: new
- A: correct
- L: correct and in position 5 (allowed)

This seems good.

So I’ll guess “BANAL”.

Let's update what we now know after five guesses.

1. Position 3 is A (from SLATE, PLAID, BANAL, FOCAL).
2. L is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 1, 4, or 5 (from SLATE, PLAID, GLORY, BANAL, FOCAL).  
   - This leaves no possible position for L, which is impossible.  
   - Therefore our interpretation must be wrong: the feedback ""L(-)"" means L is in the word but NOT in that specific position, not necessarily all positions.  
   - Re-evaluate:  
       - SLATE: L not in pos 2  
       - PLAID: L not in pos 2 (already known)  
       - GLORY: L not in pos 1  
       - BANAL: L not in pos 5  
       - FOCAL: L not in pos 5 (already known)  
   - So L can only be in positions 3 or 4.  
   - Position 3 is A, so L must be in position 4.

3. O is in the word and is in position 2 (from FOCAL: O(✓)).

4. Letters ruled out so far: S, T, E, P, I, D, G, R, Y, B, N, F, C.

5. Remaining letters to try: H, K, M, V, W, Z, U.

6. Pattern so far:  
   - Position 2: O  
   - Position 3: A  
   - Position 4: L  
   - Positions 1 and 5: must be filled from {H, K, M, V, W, Z, U}.

7. We need a valid 5-letter word matching: _ O A L _.

   - H O A L _ → “HOAL” is 4 letters.  
   - K O A L _ → “KOAL” is 4 letters.  
   - M O A L _ → “MOAL” is 4 letters.  
   - V O A L _ → “VOAL” is 4 letters.  
   - W O A L _ → “WOAL” is 4 letters.  
   - Z O A L _ → “ZOAL” is 4 letters.  
   - U O A L _ → “UOAL” is 4 letters.  

   - The only valid 5-letter word that fits is “MOCHA”, but it has H and C, and C is ruled out.  
   - “HOAGY” has G ruled out.  
   - “VOGAL” has G ruled out.  
   - “WOOLY” has Y ruled out.

   - “KOMAL” – not a word.  
   - “VOMAL” – not a word.  
   - “HOMAL” – not a word.  

   - The only valid word left is “MOCHA”, but C is ruled out.  
   - Next possibility: “HOAGY” invalid.  
   - Next: “VOGAL” invalid.  
   - Next: “KOAL” is 4 letters.  

   - Realize we missed “MOALA” – but A is already in position 3.  
   - “MOULA” – not a word.  

   - Next valid word: “MOULA” invalid.  
   - Next: “VOGAL” invalid.  
   - Next: “WOOLY” invalid.  

   - Realize we need to use remaining letters: {H, K, M, V, W, Z, U}.  
   - The only valid 5-letter word matching _ O A L _ is “MOULA” – but not a standard word.  
   - Next: “VOGAL” invalid.  
   - Next: “KOALA” – but A is already in position 3 and we have _ O A L _.  

   - Realize “KOALA” is 5 letters: K O A L A.  
   - Check letters: K, O, A, L, A.  
   - K is allowed, O is allowed, A is allowed, L is allowed, A is allowed.  
   - This fits all constraints.

Thus, the word must be KOALA.
