For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any letters, so I can test multiple letters at once.

A good choice is ""SLATE"" - it contains S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters. This should give me good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was position 1).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (it was position 4).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was position 5).
- L and A are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S, T, E (but not in positions 1, 4, 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain L or A.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses S, T, E (each in different positions) and avoids L and A. Also, the S cannot be first, T cannot be fourth, E cannot be fifth.

Possible positions for S: 2,3,4,5
Possible positions for T: 1,2,3,5
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. One such word is ""STORE"":
- S is in position 1, but we know S cannot be first, so this is invalid.
Another is ""STEER"":
- S is first (invalid), T is second (allowed), E is third (allowed), E is fourth (allowed), R is fifth (new letter). But S is first, which is invalid.

Next, ""STEEP"":
- S first (invalid).

""TESTS"":
- S first and last (invalid).

""TRIES"":
- T first (allowed), R new, I new, E third (allowed), S fifth (allowed). This seems valid because:
  - T is first (not fourth), E is third (not fifth), S is fifth (not first). Also no L or A.

This looks like a good next guess.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
   - S, T, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 4, 5 respectively.
   - L and A are not in the word.

2. TRIES → T(-) R(x) I(x) E(-) S(-)
   - T, E, S are in the word but not in positions 1, 4, 5 respectively (same as before).
   - R and I are not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word contains S, T, E (each in some position other than 1,4,5 for T and E; S not in 1 or 5).
- It does NOT contain L, A, R, I.

Positions so far:
- S cannot be in 1 or 5 → must be in 2, 3, or 4.
- T cannot be in 1 or 4 → must be in 2, 3, or 5.
- E cannot be in 4 or 5 → must be in 1, 2, or 3.

We need a 5-letter word using S, T, E plus two new letters (from remaining common ones: N, C, D, H, etc.), satisfying the positional constraints above.

Let’s list possible placements:
- E could be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.
- S could be 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.
- T could be 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.

One valid combination:
- E in 1st, S in 2nd, T in 5th → E S _ _ T
Need two more letters that are not L, A, R, I. Let’s pick common ones like N and C: ""ESNCT"" isn’t a word.

Another combination:
- E in 2nd, S in 3rd, T in 5th → _ E S _ T
Possible word: ""NESST"" – not valid.

Next:
- E in 3rd, S in 2nd, T in 5th → _ S E _ T
Possible word: ""DSECT"" – not valid.

Let’s try:
- T in 3rd, S in 2nd, E in 1st → E S T _ _
Need two more letters. ""ESTER"" – but R is excluded.

""ESTON"" – N is allowed, but O wasn’t tested yet. This seems valid.

But let me check ""ESTON"" against constraints:
- E is 1st (allowed)
- S is 2nd (allowed)
- T is 3rd (allowed)
- O is new (allowed)
- N is new (allowed)
And no L, A, R, I – good.

However, ""ESTON"" isn’t a common word. Let me think of a more common word.

Another combination:
- E in 2nd, T in 3rd, S in 4th → _ E T _ S
Need two new letters. ""BETES"" – but B and second E, and S is 4th (allowed), but E is 2nd (allowed), T is 3rd (allowed). But ""BETES"" has B and second E, but E is already confirmed, and B wasn’t tested. This seems valid.

But ""BETES"" is less common. Let me think of ""TESTS"" but S is 5th which is invalid for S.

Wait, let’s try:
- E in 3rd, S in 2nd, T in 5th → _ S E _ T
Need two new letters. ""DSECT"" – not valid.

""POSET"" – O and P are new, positions:
- P 1st (new), O 2nd (new), S 3rd (allowed), E 4th (invalid, E cannot be 4th). So invalid.

""STEEL"" – L is excluded.

""STEEP"" – E is 4th (invalid).

""STENT"" – N is new, positions:
- S 1st (invalid).

""STOLE"" – L is excluded.

""STEWS"" – W is new, positions:
- S 2nd (allowed), T 3rd (allowed), E 4th (invalid).

""STEVE"" – E is 5th (invalid).

""STEIN"" – I is excluded.

""STENO"" – O is new, positions:
- S 1st (invalid).

""STENT"" – already saw S 1st is invalid.

Let me try E in 1st, S in 3rd, T in 2nd → E T S _ _
Need two new letters. ""ETSY"" – no, 5 letters.

""ETHOS"" – H and O are new, positions:
- E 1st (allowed), T 2nd (allowed), S 3rd (allowed), H 4th (new), O 5th (allowed). But T cannot be 2nd (from TRIES feedback T was in 1st, so 2nd is allowed). This seems valid.

""ETHOS"" is a valid word.

But let me verify:
- E 1st (allowed)
- T 2nd (allowed)
- S 3rd (allowed)
- H 4th (new)
- O 5th (allowed)
No L, A, R, I – good.

This seems like a strong next guess.

But to maximize common letters, let me think of ""ESTES"" – but S is 5th (invalid).

""ESTER"" – R is excluded.

""ESTOP"" – P is new, positions:
- E 1st (allowed), S 2nd (allowed), T 3rd (allowed), O 4th (new), P 5th (new). But T is 3rd (allowed), S is 2nd (allowed). This seems valid.

""ESTOP"" is a valid word.

Between ""ETHOS"" and ""ESTOP"", ""ESTOP"" uses more common letters (O and P are common enough).

Let’s go with ""ESTOP"".
</think>

Based on the feedback so far, the secret word contains the letters S, T, and E (but not in the positions we’ve already tried), and does not contain L, A, R, or I. The remaining letters must be chosen from the unused alphabet while respecting the positional constraints.

A valid word that fits these constraints is:

""ETHOS"" is a valid word.

But let me verify:
- E 1st (allowed)
- T 2nd (allowed)
- S 3rd (allowed)
- H 4th (new)
- O 5th (allowed)
No L, A, R, I – good.

This seems like a strong next guess.

But to maximize common letters, let me think of ""ESTES"" – but S is 5th (invalid).

""ESTER"" – R is excluded.

""ESTOP"" – P is new, positions:
- E 1st (allowed), S 2nd (allowed), T 3rd (allowed), O 4th (new), P 5th (new). But T is 3rd (allowed), S is 2nd (allowed). This seems valid.

""ESTOP"" is a valid word.

Between ""ETHOS"" and ""ESTOP"", ""ESTOP"" uses more common letters (O and P are common enough).

Let’s go with ""ESTOP"".Based on the feedback so far, the secret word contains the letters S, T, and E (but not in the positions we’ve already tried), and does not contain L, A, R, or I. The remaining letters must be chosen from the unused alphabet while respecting the positional constraints.

A valid word that fits these constraints is:",Guess 3: ESTOP -> FEEDBACK: E(-) S(-) T(-) O(x) P(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any letters, so I can test multiple letters at once.

A good choice is ""SLATE"" - it contains S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters. This should give me good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was position 1).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (it was position 4).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was position 5).
- L and A are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S, T, E (but not in positions 1, 4, 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain L or A.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses S, T, E (each in different positions) and avoids L and A. Also, the S cannot be first, T cannot be fourth, E cannot be fifth.

Possible positions for S: 2,3,4,5
Possible positions for T: 1,2,3,5
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. One such word is ""STORE"":
- S is in position 1, but we know S cannot be first, so this is invalid.
Another is ""STEER"":
- S is first (invalid), T is second (allowed), E is third (allowed), E is fourth (allowed), R is fifth (new letter). But S is first, which is invalid.

Next, ""STEEP"":
- S first (invalid).

""TESTS"":
- S first and last (invalid).

""TRIES"":
- T first (allowed), R new, I new, E third (allowed), S fifth (allowed). This seems valid because:
  - T is first (not fourth), E is third (not fifth), S is fifth (not first). Also no L or A.

This looks like a good next guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: TRIES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(x) I(x) E(-) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
   - S, T, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 4, 5 respectively.
   - L and A are not in the word.

2. TRIES → T(-) R(x) I(x) E(-) S(-)
   - T, E, S are in the word but not in positions 1, 4, 5 respectively (same as before).
   - R and I are not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word contains S, T, E (each in some position other than 1,4,5 for T and E; S not in 1 or 5).
- It does NOT contain L, A, R, I.

Positions so far:
- S cannot be in 1 or 5 → must be in 2, 3, or 4.
- T cannot be in 1 or 4 → must be in 2, 3, or 5.
- E cannot be in 4 or 5 → must be in 1, 2, or 3.

We need a 5-letter word using S, T, E plus two new letters (from remaining common ones: N, C, D, H, etc.), satisfying the positional constraints above.

Let’s list possible placements:
- E could be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.
- S could be 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.
- T could be 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.

One valid combination:
- E in 1st, S in 2nd, T in 5th → E S _ _ T
Need two more letters that are not L, A, R, I. Let’s pick common ones like N and C: ""ESNCT"" isn’t a word.

Another combination:
- E in 2nd, S in 3rd, T in 5th → _ E S _ T
Possible word: ""NESST"" – not valid.

Next:
- E in 3rd, S in 2nd, T in 5th → _ S E _ T
Possible word: ""DSECT"" – not valid.

Let’s try:
- T in 3rd, S in 2nd, E in 1st → E S T _ _
Need two more letters. ""ESTER"" – but R is excluded.

""ESTON"" – N is allowed, but O wasn’t tested yet. This seems valid.

But let me check ""ESTON"" against constraints:
- E is 1st (allowed)
- S is 2nd (allowed)
- T is 3rd (allowed)
- O is new (allowed)
- N is new (allowed)
And no L, A, R, I – good.

However, ""ESTON"" isn’t a common word. Let me think of a more common word.

Another combination:
- E in 2nd, T in 3rd, S in 4th → _ E T _ S
Need two new letters. ""BETES"" – but B and second E, and S is 4th (allowed), but E is 2nd (allowed), T is 3rd (allowed). But ""BETES"" has B and second E, but E is already confirmed, and B wasn’t tested. This seems valid.

But ""BETES"" is less common. Let me think of ""TESTS"" but S is 5th which is invalid for S.

Wait, let’s try:
- E in 3rd, S in 2nd, T in 5th → _ S E _ T
Need two new letters. ""DSECT"" – not valid.

""POSET"" – O and P are new, positions:
- P 1st (new), O 2nd (new), S 3rd (allowed), E 4th (invalid, E cannot be 4th). So invalid.

""STEEL"" – L is excluded.

""STEEP"" – E is 4th (invalid).

""STENT"" – N is new, positions:
- S 1st (invalid).

""STOLE"" – L is excluded.

""STEWS"" – W is new, positions:
- S 2nd (allowed), T 3rd (allowed), E 4th (invalid).

""STEVE"" – E is 5th (invalid).

""STEIN"" – I is excluded.

""STENO"" – O is new, positions:
- S 1st (invalid).

""STENT"" – already saw S 1st is invalid.

Let me try E in 1st, S in 3rd, T in 2nd → E T S _ _
Need two new letters. ""ETSY"" – no, 5 letters.

""ETHOS"" – H and O are new, positions:
- E 1st (allowed), T 2nd (allowed), S 3rd (allowed), H 4th (new), O 5th (allowed). But T cannot be 2nd (from TRIES feedback T was in 1st, so 2nd is allowed). This seems valid.

""ETHOS"" is a valid word.

But let me verify:
- E 1st (allowed)
- T 2nd (allowed)
- S 3rd (allowed)
- H 4th (new)
- O 5th (allowed)
No L, A, R, I – good.

This seems like a strong next guess.

But to maximize common letters, let me think of ""ESTES"" – but S is 5th (invalid).

""ESTER"" – R is excluded.

""ESTOP"" – P is new, positions:
- E 1st (allowed), S 2nd (allowed), T 3rd (allowed), O 4th (new), P 5th (new). But T is 3rd (allowed), S is 2nd (allowed). This seems valid.

""ESTOP"" is a valid word.

Between ""ETHOS"" and ""ESTOP"", ""ESTOP"" uses more common letters (O and P are common enough).

From the new feedback on ESTOP:

- E is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- T is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- O and P are NOT in the word.

So now we know:

Letters that must be present: S, T, E  
Letters that must NOT be present: L, A, R, I, O, P

Positions ruled out so far:
- S cannot be 1st (from SLATE), 2nd (from ESTOP), or 5th (from TRIES) → S must be in position 3 or 4.
- T cannot be 4th (from SLATE), 1st (from ESTOP), or 3rd (from ESTOP) → T must be in position 2 or 5.
- E cannot be 1st (from ESTOP), 4th (from TRIES), or 5th (from TRIES) → E must be in position 2 or 3.

We need a valid 5-letter word that uses S, T, E exactly once each, plus two new letters (from the remaining alphabet excluding the forbidden ones). Let’s list possible placements.

Case 1: E in position 2
Then S and T must fit into 3 or 4, 2 or 5 respectively, but E is already in 2, so:
- S could be 3 or 4
- T could be 5 (since 2 is taken by E and 3 is open if S isn’t there)

Possible structure: _ E S _ T  or  _ E _ S T

Case 2: E in position 3
Then:
- S must be 4 (since 3 is taken by E)
- T must be 2 or 5

Possible structures: _ T E S _  or  _ _ E S T  (but T must be 2 or 5, so _ T E S _ is valid)

Let’s explore both cases and find common words.

Case 1: _ E S _ T
Need two new letters (not in forbidden list). Common letters left: N, C, D, H, etc.
Try “NESST” – invalid (double S).  
“CESST” – invalid.  
“DESET” – invalid.  
“BESOT” – but O is forbidden.  
“MESST” – invalid.  
“HEXET” – X and H are new, but “HEXET” isn’t a word.

Case 2: _ T E S _
Structure: _ T E S _
Possible word: “UTENS” – but U is allowed, N is allowed, S is 5th (allowed).  
“UTENS” is valid.

Another: “ATENS” – but A is forbidden.

“ETENS” – E is already used.

“FTENS” – F and T, but T is already used.

“GTENS” – G and T, but T is already used.

“ITENS” – I is forbidden.

“KTENS” – K is allowed, but “KTENS” isn’t a word.

“MTENS” – M is allowed, but “MTENS” isn’t a word.

“PTENS” – P is forbidden.

“XTENS” – X is allowed, but “XTENS” isn’t a word.

“YTENS” – Y is allowed, but “YTENS” isn’t a word.

“ZTENS” – Z is allowed, but “ZTENS” isn’t a word.

Let’s re-examine Case 1 with better letter choices.

Case 1: _ E _ S T
Need two new letters.  
“NESTS” – but S is 4th here (allowed), T is 5th (allowed), N is new.  
“NESTS” is valid.

Check constraints:
- N 1st (new) – allowed  
- E 2nd (allowed) – E must be in 2 or 3, 2 is allowed  
- S 4th (allowed) – S must be 3 or 4, 4 is allowed  
- T 5th (allowed) – T must be 2 or 5, 5 is allowed  
- S is 4th, so no conflict with earlier S positions.

“NESTS” is a valid common word that fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next logical guess is:

<guess>NESTS</guess>
</think>

<guess>NESTS</guess>",NESTS,"From the new feedback on ESTOP:

- E is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- T is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- O and P are NOT in the word.

So now we know:

Letters that must be present: S, T, E  
Letters that must NOT be present: L, A, R, I, O, P

Positions ruled out so far:
- S cannot be 1st (from SLATE), 2nd (from ESTOP), or 5th (from TRIES) → S must be in position 3 or 4.
- T cannot be 4th (from SLATE), 1st (from ESTOP), or 3rd (from ESTOP) → T must be in position 2 or 5.
- E cannot be 1st (from ESTOP), 4th (from TRIES), or 5th (from TRIES) → E must be in position 2 or 3.

We need a valid 5-letter word that uses S, T, E exactly once each, plus two new letters (from the remaining alphabet excluding the forbidden ones). Let’s list possible placements.

Case 1: E in position 2
Then S and T must fit into 3 or 4, 2 or 5 respectively, but E is already in 2, so:
- S could be 3 or 4
- T could be 5 (since 2 is taken by E and 3 is open if S isn’t there)

Possible structure: _ E S _ T  or  _ E _ S T

Case 2: E in position 3
Then:
- S must be 4 (since 3 is taken by E)
- T must be 2 or 5

Possible structures: _ T E S _  or  _ _ E S T  (but T must be 2 or 5, so _ T E S _ is valid)

Let’s explore both cases and find common words.

Case 1: _ E S _ T
Need two new letters (not in forbidden list). Common letters left: N, C, D, H, etc.
Try “NESST” – invalid (double S).  
“CESST” – invalid.  
“DESET” – invalid.  
“BESOT” – but O is forbidden.  
“MESST” – invalid.  
“HEXET” – X and H are new, but “HEXET” isn’t a word.

Case 2: _ T E S _

Possible word: “UTENS” – but U is allowed, N is allowed, S is 5th (allowed).  
“UTENS” is valid.

Let’s re-examine Case 1 with better letter choices.

Case 1: _ E _ S T
Need two new letters.  
“NESTS” – but S is 4th here (allowed), T is 5th (allowed), N is new.  
“NESTS” is valid.

Check constraints:

- T 5th (allowed) – T must be 2 or 5, 5 is allowed

“NESTS” is a valid common word that fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any letters, so I can test multiple letters at once.

A good choice is ""SLATE"" - it contains S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters. This should give me good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was position 1).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (it was position 4).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was position 5).
- L and A are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S, T, E (but not in positions 1, 4, 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain L or A.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses S, T, E (each in different positions) and avoids L and A. Also, the S cannot be first, T cannot be fourth, E cannot be fifth.

Possible positions for S: 2,3,4,5
Possible positions for T: 1,2,3,5
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. One such word is ""STORE"":
- S is in position 1, but we know S cannot be first, so this is invalid.
Another is ""STEER"":
- S is first (invalid), T is second (allowed), E is third (allowed), E is fourth (allowed), R is fifth (new letter). But S is first, which is invalid.

Next, ""STEEP"":
- S first (invalid).

""TESTS"":
- S first and last (invalid).

""TRIES"":
- T first (allowed), R new, I new, E third (allowed), S fifth (allowed). This seems valid because:
  - T is first (not fourth), E is third (not fifth), S is fifth (not first). Also no L or A.

This looks like a good next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
Guess 2: TRIES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(x) I(x) E(-) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
   - S, T, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 4, 5 respectively.
   - L and A are not in the word.

2. TRIES → T(-) R(x) I(x) E(-) S(-)
   - T, E, S are in the word but not in positions 1, 4, 5 respectively (same as before).
   - R and I are not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word contains S, T, E (each in some position other than 1,4,5 for T and E; S not in 1 or 5).
- It does NOT contain L, A, R, I.

Positions so far:
- S cannot be in 1 or 5 → must be in 2, 3, or 4.
- T cannot be in 1 or 4 → must be in 2, 3, or 5.
- E cannot be in 4 or 5 → must be in 1, 2, or 3.

We need a 5-letter word using S, T, E plus two new letters (from remaining common ones: N, C, D, H, etc.), satisfying the positional constraints above.

Let’s list possible placements:
- E could be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.
- S could be 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.
- T could be 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.

One valid combination:
- E in 1st, S in 2nd, T in 5th → E S _ _ T
Need two more letters that are not L, A, R, I. Let’s pick common ones like N and C: ""ESNCT"" isn’t a word.

Another combination:
- E in 2nd, S in 3rd, T in 5th → _ E S _ T
Possible word: ""NESST"" – not valid.

Next:
- E in 3rd, S in 2nd, T in 5th → _ S E _ T
Possible word: ""DSECT"" – not valid.

Let’s try:
- T in 3rd, S in 2nd, E in 1st → E S T _ _
Need two more letters. ""ESTER"" – but R is excluded.

""ESTON"" – N is allowed, but O wasn’t tested yet. This seems valid.

But let me check ""ESTON"" against constraints:
- E is 1st (allowed)
- S is 2nd (allowed)
- T is 3rd (allowed)
- O is new (allowed)
- N is new (allowed)
And no L, A, R, I – good.

However, ""ESTON"" isn’t a common word. Let me think of a more common word.

Another combination:
- E in 2nd, T in 3rd, S in 4th → _ E T _ S
Need two new letters. ""BETES"" – but B and second E, and S is 4th (allowed), but E is 2nd (allowed), T is 3rd (allowed). But ""BETES"" has B and second E, but E is already confirmed, and B wasn’t tested. This seems valid.

But ""BETES"" is less common. Let me think of ""TESTS"" but S is 5th which is invalid for S.

Wait, let’s try:
- E in 3rd, S in 2nd, T in 5th → _ S E _ T
Need two new letters. ""DSECT"" – not valid.

""POSET"" – O and P are new, positions:
- P 1st (new), O 2nd (new), S 3rd (allowed), E 4th (invalid, E cannot be 4th). So invalid.

""STEEL"" – L is excluded.

""STEEP"" – E is 4th (invalid).

""STENT"" – N is new, positions:
- S 1st (invalid).

""STOLE"" – L is excluded.

""STEWS"" – W is new, positions:
- S 2nd (allowed), T 3rd (allowed), E 4th (invalid).

""STEVE"" – E is 5th (invalid).

""STEIN"" – I is excluded.

""STENO"" – O is new, positions:
- S 1st (invalid).

""STENT"" – already saw S 1st is invalid.

Let me try E in 1st, S in 3rd, T in 2nd → E T S _ _
Need two new letters. ""ETSY"" – no, 5 letters.

""ETHOS"" – H and O are new, positions:
- E 1st (allowed), T 2nd (allowed), S 3rd (allowed), H 4th (new), O 5th (allowed). But T cannot be 2nd (from TRIES feedback T was in 1st, so 2nd is allowed). This seems valid.

""ETHOS"" is a valid word.

But let me verify:
- E 1st (allowed)
- T 2nd (allowed)
- S 3rd (allowed)
- H 4th (new)
- O 5th (allowed)
No L, A, R, I – good.

This seems like a strong next guess.

But to maximize common letters, let me think of ""ESTES"" – but S is 5th (invalid).

""ESTER"" – R is excluded.

""ESTOP"" – P is new, positions:
- E 1st (allowed), S 2nd (allowed), T 3rd (allowed), O 4th (new), P 5th (new). But T is 3rd (allowed), S is 2nd (allowed). This seems valid.

""ESTOP"" is a valid word.

Between ""ETHOS"" and ""ESTOP"", ""ESTOP"" uses more common letters (O and P are common enough).

Let’s go with ""ESTOP"".Based on the feedback so far, the secret word contains the letters S, T, and E (but not in the positions we’ve already tried), and does not contain L, A, R, or I. The remaining letters must be chosen from the unused alphabet while respecting the positional constraints.

A valid word that fits these constraints is:

<guess>ESTOP</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
Guess 2: TRIES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(x) I(x) E(-) S(-)
Guess 3: ESTOP -> FEEDBACK: E(-) S(-) T(-) O(x) P(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ESTOP:

- E is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- T is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- O and P are NOT in the word.

So now we know:

Letters that must be present: S, T, E  
Letters that must NOT be present: L, A, R, I, O, P

Positions ruled out so far:
- S cannot be 1st (from SLATE), 2nd (from ESTOP), or 5th (from TRIES) → S must be in position 3 or 4.
- T cannot be 4th (from SLATE), 1st (from ESTOP), or 3rd (from ESTOP) → T must be in position 2 or 5.
- E cannot be 1st (from ESTOP), 4th (from TRIES), or 5th (from TRIES) → E must be in position 2 or 3.

We need a valid 5-letter word that uses S, T, E exactly once each, plus two new letters (from the remaining alphabet excluding the forbidden ones). Let’s list possible placements.

Case 1: E in position 2
Then S and T must fit into 3 or 4, 2 or 5 respectively, but E is already in 2, so:
- S could be 3 or 4
- T could be 5 (since 2 is taken by E and 3 is open if S isn’t there)

Possible structure: _ E S _ T  or  _ E _ S T

Case 2: E in position 3
Then:
- S must be 4 (since 3 is taken by E)
- T must be 2 or 5

Possible structures: _ T E S _  or  _ _ E S T  (but T must be 2 or 5, so _ T E S _ is valid)

Let’s explore both cases and find common words.

Case 1: _ E S _ T
Need two new letters (not in forbidden list). Common letters left: N, C, D, H, etc.
Try “NESST” – invalid (double S).  
“CESST” – invalid.  
“DESET” – invalid.  
“BESOT” – but O is forbidden.  
“MESST” – invalid.  
“HEXET” – X and H are new, but “HEXET” isn’t a word.

Case 2: _ T E S _
Structure: _ T E S _
Possible word: “UTENS” – but U is allowed, N is allowed, S is 5th (allowed).  
“UTENS” is valid.

Another: “ATENS” – but A is forbidden.

“ETENS” – E is already used.

“FTENS” – F and T, but T is already used.

“GTENS” – G and T, but T is already used.

“ITENS” – I is forbidden.

“KTENS” – K is allowed, but “KTENS” isn’t a word.

“MTENS” – M is allowed, but “MTENS” isn’t a word.

“PTENS” – P is forbidden.

“XTENS” – X is allowed, but “XTENS” isn’t a word.

“YTENS” – Y is allowed, but “YTENS” isn’t a word.

“ZTENS” – Z is allowed, but “ZTENS” isn’t a word.

Let’s re-examine Case 1 with better letter choices.

Case 1: _ E _ S T
Need two new letters.  
“NESTS” – but S is 4th here (allowed), T is 5th (allowed), N is new.  
“NESTS” is valid.

Check constraints:
- N 1st (new) – allowed  
- E 2nd (allowed) – E must be in 2 or 3, 2 is allowed  
- S 4th (allowed) – S must be 3 or 4, 4 is allowed  
- T 5th (allowed) – T must be 2 or 5, 5 is allowed  
- S is 4th, so no conflict with earlier S positions.

“NESTS” is a valid common word that fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next logical guess is:

From the feedback on NESTS:
- N is NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (-).
- T is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).
- The last S is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

So far we know:
Letters that must appear: S, T, E (each at least once).
Letters that must NOT appear: L, A, R, I, O, P, N.

Positions ruled out:
S cannot be 1st (SLATE), 2nd (ESTOP), 3rd (NESTS), 4th (NESTS), or 5th (NESTS).  
Wait, that leaves only position 3 for S, but S is also ruled out of 3rd by NESTS feedback.

Hold on: let’s re-read the feedback carefully.

Guess 4: NESTS -> FEEDBACK: N(x) E(-) S(-) T(-) S(-)
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 3 (the third letter is S, so it’s not in 3rd).
- T is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- The final S is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So S cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. The only possible position left for S is position 4.  
But in NESTS, S was in positions 3 and 5, both ruled out. So S must be in position 4.

Similarly, for T:
From TRIES: T not in 1st.
From ESTOP: T not in 3rd.
From NESTS: T not in 4th.
So T must be in position 2 or 5.

For E:
From TRIES: E not in 4th or 5th.
From ESTOP: E not in 1st.
From NESTS: E not in 2nd.
So E must be in position 3.

So the only possible positions are:
E in 3, S in 4, T in 2 or 5.

Thus the word must look like:
_ T E S _  or  _ _ E S T

Letters left to choose: positions 1 and 5 (or 1 and 2 if T is in 5).

Available letters (not in forbidden list): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two new letters (positions 1 and 5) that are allowed.

Let’s list possible words:

1. _ T E S _

   - Position 5: any allowed letter.

   - B X E S T – “BX EST” – invalid.
   - B Y E S T – “BY EST” – invalid.
   - B Z E S T – “BZ EST” – invalid.

Hmm, none of these combinations seem to form valid English words. Let’s try with other starting letters.

Try starting with C:
- C T E S _ – “CTES_” – invalid.
- C _ E S T – “C E S T” – need position 2.
   - C D E S T – “CDEST” – invalid.
   - C H E S T – “CHEST” – valid word!

Check constraints for “CHEST”:
- C: new, allowed (not in forbidden list).
- H: new, allowed.
- E: position 3 (allowed).

- T: position 5 (allowed).

All constraints satisfied.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters without repeating any letters, so I can test multiple letters at once.

A good choice is ""SLATE"" - it contains S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters. This should give me good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the secret word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was position 1).
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (it was position 4).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (it was position 5).
- L and A are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S, T, E (but not in positions 1, 4, 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain L or A.

I need a new 5-letter word that uses S, T, E (each in different positions) and avoids L and A. Also, the S cannot be first, T cannot be fourth, E cannot be fifth.

Possible positions for S: 2,3,4,5
Possible positions for T: 1,2,3,5
Possible positions for E: 1,2,3,4

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. One such word is ""STORE"":
- S is in position 1, but we know S cannot be first, so this is invalid.
Another is ""STEER"":
- S is first (invalid), T is second (allowed), E is third (allowed), E is fourth (allowed), R is fifth (new letter). But S is first, which is invalid.

Next, ""STEEP"":
- S first (invalid).

""TESTS"":
- S first and last (invalid).

""TRIES"":
- T first (allowed), R new, I new, E third (allowed), S fifth (allowed). This seems valid because:
  - T is first (not fourth), E is third (not fifth), S is fifth (not first). Also no L or A.

This looks like a good next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
Guess 2: TRIES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(x) I(x) E(-) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two pieces of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
   - S, T, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 4, 5 respectively.
   - L and A are not in the word.

2. TRIES → T(-) R(x) I(x) E(-) S(-)
   - T, E, S are in the word but not in positions 1, 4, 5 respectively (same as before).
   - R and I are not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word contains S, T, E (each in some position other than 1,4,5 for T and E; S not in 1 or 5).
- It does NOT contain L, A, R, I.

Positions so far:
- S cannot be in 1 or 5 → must be in 2, 3, or 4.
- T cannot be in 1 or 4 → must be in 2, 3, or 5.
- E cannot be in 4 or 5 → must be in 1, 2, or 3.

We need a 5-letter word using S, T, E plus two new letters (from remaining common ones: N, C, D, H, etc.), satisfying the positional constraints above.

Let’s list possible placements:
- E could be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.
- S could be 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.
- T could be 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.

One valid combination:
- E in 1st, S in 2nd, T in 5th → E S _ _ T
Need two more letters that are not L, A, R, I. Let’s pick common ones like N and C: ""ESNCT"" isn’t a word.

Another combination:
- E in 2nd, S in 3rd, T in 5th → _ E S _ T
Possible word: ""NESST"" – not valid.

Next:
- E in 3rd, S in 2nd, T in 5th → _ S E _ T
Possible word: ""DSECT"" – not valid.

Let’s try:
- T in 3rd, S in 2nd, E in 1st → E S T _ _
Need two more letters. ""ESTER"" – but R is excluded.

""ESTON"" – N is allowed, but O wasn’t tested yet. This seems valid.

But let me check ""ESTON"" against constraints:
- E is 1st (allowed)
- S is 2nd (allowed)
- T is 3rd (allowed)
- O is new (allowed)
- N is new (allowed)
And no L, A, R, I – good.

However, ""ESTON"" isn’t a common word. Let me think of a more common word.

Another combination:
- E in 2nd, T in 3rd, S in 4th → _ E T _ S
Need two new letters. ""BETES"" – but B and second E, and S is 4th (allowed), but E is 2nd (allowed), T is 3rd (allowed). But ""BETES"" has B and second E, but E is already confirmed, and B wasn’t tested. This seems valid.

But ""BETES"" is less common. Let me think of ""TESTS"" but S is 5th which is invalid for S.

Wait, let’s try:
- E in 3rd, S in 2nd, T in 5th → _ S E _ T
Need two new letters. ""DSECT"" – not valid.

""POSET"" – O and P are new, positions:
- P 1st (new), O 2nd (new), S 3rd (allowed), E 4th (invalid, E cannot be 4th). So invalid.

""STEEL"" – L is excluded.

""STEEP"" – E is 4th (invalid).

""STENT"" – N is new, positions:
- S 1st (invalid).

""STOLE"" – L is excluded.

""STEWS"" – W is new, positions:
- S 2nd (allowed), T 3rd (allowed), E 4th (invalid).

""STEVE"" – E is 5th (invalid).

""STEIN"" – I is excluded.

""STENO"" – O is new, positions:
- S 1st (invalid).

""STENT"" – already saw S 1st is invalid.

Let me try E in 1st, S in 3rd, T in 2nd → E T S _ _
Need two new letters. ""ETSY"" – no, 5 letters.

""ETHOS"" – H and O are new, positions:
- E 1st (allowed), T 2nd (allowed), S 3rd (allowed), H 4th (new), O 5th (allowed). But T cannot be 2nd (from TRIES feedback T was in 1st, so 2nd is allowed). This seems valid.

""ETHOS"" is a valid word.

But let me verify:
- E 1st (allowed)
- T 2nd (allowed)
- S 3rd (allowed)
- H 4th (new)
- O 5th (allowed)
No L, A, R, I – good.

This seems like a strong next guess.

But to maximize common letters, let me think of ""ESTES"" – but S is 5th (invalid).

""ESTER"" – R is excluded.

""ESTOP"" – P is new, positions:
- E 1st (allowed), S 2nd (allowed), T 3rd (allowed), O 4th (new), P 5th (new). But T is 3rd (allowed), S is 2nd (allowed). This seems valid.

""ESTOP"" is a valid word.

Between ""ETHOS"" and ""ESTOP"", ""ESTOP"" uses more common letters (O and P are common enough).

Let’s go with ""ESTOP"".Based on the feedback so far, the secret word contains the letters S, T, and E (but not in the positions we’ve already tried), and does not contain L, A, R, or I. The remaining letters must be chosen from the unused alphabet while respecting the positional constraints.

A valid word that fits these constraints is:

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)

Guess 3: ESTOP -> FEEDBACK: E(-) S(-) T(-) O(x) P(x)
<|im_end|>

From the new feedback on ESTOP:

- E is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- T is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- O and P are NOT in the word.

So now we know:

Letters that must be present: S, T, E  
Letters that must NOT be present: L, A, R, I, O, P

Positions ruled out so far:
- S cannot be 1st (from SLATE), 2nd (from ESTOP), or 5th (from TRIES) → S must be in position 3 or 4.
- T cannot be 4th (from SLATE), 1st (from ESTOP), or 3rd (from ESTOP) → T must be in position 2 or 5.
- E cannot be 1st (from ESTOP), 4th (from TRIES), or 5th (from TRIES) → E must be in position 2 or 3.

We need a valid 5-letter word that uses S, T, E exactly once each, plus two new letters (from the remaining alphabet excluding the forbidden ones). Let’s list possible placements.

Case 1: E in position 2
Then S and T must fit into 3 or 4, 2 or 5 respectively, but E is already in 2, so:
- S could be 3 or 4
- T could be 5 (since 2 is taken by E and 3 is open if S isn’t there)

Possible structure: _ E S _ T  or  _ E _ S T

Case 2: E in position 3
Then:
- S must be 4 (since 3 is taken by E)
- T must be 2 or 5

Possible structures: _ T E S _  or  _ _ E S T  (but T must be 2 or 5, so _ T E S _ is valid)

Let’s explore both cases and find common words.

Case 1: _ E S _ T
Need two new letters (not in forbidden list). Common letters left: N, C, D, H, etc.
Try “NESST” – invalid (double S).  
“CESST” – invalid.  
“DESET” – invalid.  
“BESOT” – but O is forbidden.  
“MESST” – invalid.  
“HEXET” – X and H are new, but “HEXET” isn’t a word.

Case 2: _ T E S _
Structure: _ T E S _
Possible word: “UTENS” – but U is allowed, N is allowed, S is 5th (allowed).  
“UTENS” is valid.

Another: “ATENS” – but A is forbidden.

“ETENS” – E is already used.

“FTENS” – F and T, but T is already used.

“GTENS” – G and T, but T is already used.

“ITENS” – I is forbidden.

“KTENS” – K is allowed, but “KTENS” isn’t a word.

“MTENS” – M is allowed, but “MTENS” isn’t a word.

“PTENS” – P is forbidden.

“XTENS” – X is allowed, but “XTENS” isn’t a word.

“YTENS” – Y is allowed, but “YTENS” isn’t a word.

“ZTENS” – Z is allowed, but “ZTENS” isn’t a word.

Let’s re-examine Case 1 with better letter choices.

Case 1: _ E _ S T
Need two new letters.  
“NESTS” – but S is 4th here (allowed), T is 5th (allowed), N is new.  
“NESTS” is valid.

Check constraints:
- N 1st (new) – allowed  
- E 2nd (allowed) – E must be in 2 or 3, 2 is allowed  
- S 4th (allowed) – S must be 3 or 4, 4 is allowed  
- T 5th (allowed) – T must be 2 or 5, 5 is allowed  
- S is 4th, so no conflict with earlier S positions.

“NESTS” is a valid common word that fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next logical guess is:

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
Guess 2: TRIES -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(x) I(x) E(-) S(-)
Guess 3: ESTOP -> FEEDBACK: E(-) S(-) T(-) O(x) P(x)
Guess 4: NESTS -> FEEDBACK: N(x) E(-) S(-) T(-) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on NESTS:
- N is NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- S is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (-).
- T is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).
- The last S is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

So far we know:
Letters that must appear: S, T, E (each at least once).
Letters that must NOT appear: L, A, R, I, O, P, N.

Positions ruled out:
S cannot be 1st (SLATE), 2nd (ESTOP), 3rd (NESTS), 4th (NESTS), or 5th (NESTS).  
Wait, that leaves only position 3 for S, but S is also ruled out of 3rd by NESTS feedback.

Hold on: let’s re-read the feedback carefully.

Guess 4: NESTS -> FEEDBACK: N(x) E(-) S(-) T(-) S(-)
- N is not in the word.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- S is in the word but NOT in position 3 (the third letter is S, so it’s not in 3rd).
- T is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- The final S is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So S cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. The only possible position left for S is position 4.  
But in NESTS, S was in positions 3 and 5, both ruled out. So S must be in position 4.

Similarly, for T:
From TRIES: T not in 1st.
From ESTOP: T not in 3rd.
From NESTS: T not in 4th.
So T must be in position 2 or 5.

For E:
From TRIES: E not in 4th or 5th.
From ESTOP: E not in 1st.
From NESTS: E not in 2nd.
So E must be in position 3.

So the only possible positions are:
E in 3, S in 4, T in 2 or 5.

Thus the word must look like:
_ T E S _  or  _ _ E S T

Letters left to choose: positions 1 and 5 (or 1 and 2 if T is in 5).

Available letters (not in forbidden list): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two new letters (positions 1 and 5) that are allowed.

Let’s list possible words:

1. _ T E S _
   - Position 1: any allowed letter.
   - Position 5: any allowed letter.
   - Example: B T E S C → “BTESC” – invalid (not a word).
   - Try “UTENS” – but N is forbidden.
   - Try “UTEST” – but T is already used in 2nd.
   - Try “HTEST” – invalid.
   - Try “MTEST” – invalid.
   - Try “GTEST” – invalid.
   - Try “VTEST” – invalid.
   - Try “C TEST” – invalid.
   - Try “K TEST” – invalid.
   - Try “D TEST” – invalid.
   - Try “F TEST” – invalid.
   - Try “W TEST” – invalid.
   - Try “Y TEST” – invalid.
   - Try “Z TEST” – invalid.

2. _ _ E S T
   - Position 1 and 2 must be new letters.
   - Example: B A E S T – but A is forbidden.
   - B C E S T – “BCEST” – invalid.
   - B D E S T – “BDEST” – invalid.
   - B F E S T – “BFE ST” – invalid.
   - B G E S T – “BGE ST” – invalid.
   - B H E S T – “BHEST” – invalid.
   - B J E S T – “BJEST” – invalid.
   - B K E S T – “BKEST” – invalid.
   - B M E S T – “BMEST” – invalid.
   - B Q E S T – “BQUEST” – too long.
   - B U E S T – “BU EST” – invalid.
   - B V E S T – “BV EST” – invalid.
   - B W E S T – “BW EST” – invalid.
   - B X E S T – “BX EST” – invalid.
   - B Y E S T – “BY EST” – invalid.
   - B Z E S T – “BZ EST” – invalid.

Hmm, none of these combinations seem to form valid English words. Let’s try with other starting letters.

Try starting with C:
- C T E S _ – “CTES_” – invalid.
- C _ E S T – “C E S T” – need position 2.
   - C D E S T – “CDEST” – invalid.
   - C H E S T – “CHEST” – valid word!

Check constraints for “CHEST”:
- C: new, allowed (not in forbidden list).
- H: new, allowed.
- E: position 3 (allowed).
- S: position 4 (allowed).
- T: position 5 (allowed).

All constraints satisfied.

Therefore, the next logical guess is:

From the feedback on CHEST:
- C is NOT in the word (x).
- H is NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the secret word looks like: _ _ E S T

We need to determine the first two letters.  
Forbidden letters so far: L, A, R, I, O, P, N, C, H.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two distinct letters from the allowed set for positions 1 and 2.

Let’s list common 5-letter words ending in “EST”:
- BEAST – but A is forbidden.
- FEAST – A is forbidden.
- GEAST – not a word.
- LEAST – L and A are forbidden.
- MEAST – not a word.
- PEAST – P is forbidden.
- SEAST – S is already in position 4.
- WEAST – not a word.
- YEAST – A is forbidden.
- DEBTS – ends in “T” but not “EST”.

Wait, let’s systematically try allowed letters for positions 1 and 2:

Possible first letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Possible second letters: same set, excluding the first letter.

Looking for valid English words:
- B D E S T – “BDEST” – invalid.

Check “QUEST”:
- Q: allowed (not in forbidden list).
- U: allowed.
- E: position 3 (matches).
- S: position 4 (matches).
- T: position 5 (matches).

All constraints satisfied.

Therefore, the next logical guess is:

<guess>QUEST</guess>
</think>

<guess>QUEST</guess>",QUEST,"From the feedback on CHEST:
- C is NOT in the word (x).
- H is NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the secret word looks like: _ _ E S T

We need to determine the first two letters.  
Forbidden letters so far: L, A, R, I, O, P, N, C, H.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two distinct letters from the allowed set for positions 1 and 2.

Let’s list common 5-letter words ending in “EST”:
- BEAST – but A is forbidden.
- FEAST – A is forbidden.
- GEAST – not a word.
- LEAST – L and A are forbidden.
- MEAST – not a word.
- PEAST – P is forbidden.
- SEAST – S is already in position 4.
- WEAST – not a word.
- YEAST – A is forbidden.
- DEBTS – ends in “T” but not “EST”.

Wait, let’s systematically try allowed letters for positions 1 and 2:

Possible first letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Possible second letters: same set, excluding the first letter.
