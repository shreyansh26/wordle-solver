For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm several possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct letters to maximize the information gained.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This will give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but ""AROSE"" might be slightly better due to the higher frequency of A, R, O, S, E. After considering various options, ""AROSE"" seems like the optimal first guess to gather maximum information.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ O _ E, and it definitely does NOT contain A, R, or S.

Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

To maximize information, pick a word that:
1. Keeps the known pattern _ _ O _ E.
2. Introduces new common letters not yet tested (e.g., T, L, N, C, H, I, etc.).
3. Avoids any already excluded letters (A, R, S).

Good candidates:
- ""COUNT"" → C, O, U, N, T (but O is already fixed in 3rd place, so pattern would be _ U O _ T → doesn't match _ _ O _ E)
- ""CHOKE"" → C, H, O, K, E (but pattern would be C H O K E → matches _ _ O _ E)
- ""MONEY"" → M, O, N, E, Y (pattern M _ O N E → matches _ _ O _ E)
- ""TONEY"" → T, O, N, E, Y (pattern T _ O N E → matches _ _ O _ N E, but N is 4th here)
- ""LONEY"" → L, O, N, E, Y (pattern L _ O N E → matches _ _ O _ N E)

Among these, ""CHOKE"" is appealing because it tests C, H, K while fitting the pattern C H O K E. However, let's verify:
- C (new letter)
- H (new letter)
- O (known correct)
- K (new letter)
- E (known correct)

This tests three new letters (C, H, K) while maintaining the known pattern. Another good option is ""MONEY"" which tests M, N, Y.

Between CHOKE and MONEY, I'll go with MONEY as it tests M, N, Y which are all common and useful letters.

Let's process the new feedback for MONEY:

- M(x) → M is NOT in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (since in MONEY it was in position 2, but the feedback says it's in the word but wrong position).
- N(x) → N is NOT in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (since in MONEY it was in position 4, but the feedback says it's in the word but wrong position).
- Y(x) → Y is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ _ _ (but we have O and E somewhere, and they are NOT in positions 2 and 4 respectively).
- Excluded letters: A, R, S, M, N, Y.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4.

We also know from Guess 1 that:
- O was in position 3 and was ✓ (correct), but now in Guess 2 it's in position 2 and is (-) (wrong position). This seems contradictory unless the feedback is per-guess. Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.

Wait, the feedback for Guess 1 (AROSE) was:
A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)

This means:
- O is in the correct position (position 3).
- E is in the correct position (position 5).

The feedback for Guess 2 (MONEY) was:
M(x) O(-) N(x) E(-) Y(x)

This means:
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (since in MONEY it was in position 2, but feedback says wrong position).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (since in MONEY it was in position 4, but feedback says wrong position).

But from Guess 1 we already know E is in position 5. So the feedback for MONEY's E in position 4 being wrong is consistent (it's actually in position 5). Similarly, O in Guess 1 was in position 3 (correct), so in MONEY it's in position 2 (wrong position), which is fine.

So current constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ E (from Guess 1)
- Excluded letters: A, R, S, M, N, Y
- O is in position 3 (confirmed by Guess 1)
- E is in position 5 (confirmed by Guess 1)
- Letters not yet tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word with pattern _ _ O _ E, using only allowed letters.

Possible words:
- BLOKE → B, L, O, K, E → but O is position 3, E is position 5 → pattern _ _ O K E → but we need _ _ O _ E → this doesn't fit.
- CLOKE → but ""clove"" is 5 letters, but CLOVE has O in position 3 and E in position 5 → pattern C L O V E → this fits _ _ O _ E (positions: C(1), L(2), O(3), V(4), E(5)).

But let's verify:
CLOVE:
- C (new)
- L (new)
- O (correct position 3)
- V (new)
- E (correct position 5)

This tests C, L, V while maintaining the known pattern. However, ""clove"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""DOPEY"" → but Y is excluded.
""FOGEY"" → Y excluded.
""GOUGE"" → G, U, G, E → but G is repeated, and U is new.
""BOGEY"" → same issue with Y.
""BOOZE"" → Z is new, but O is repeated (position 3 already has O, but pattern allows repeats? Actually, the pattern is _ _ O _ E, so position 3 is O, position 4 can't be O because E is in 5, but ""booze"" has O in 3 and 4, which would conflict with pattern _ _ O _ E (position 4 would be O, but E is in 5, so pattern is _ _ O O E which is invalid).

Wait, the pattern is _ _ O _ E, so position 4 must be a different letter. So ""booze"" is invalid.

Another option: ""COVEY"" → C, O, V, E, Y → Y is excluded.
""DOVER"" → R is excluded.
""LOUSE"" → S is excluded.
""POKE"" is 4 letters.
""BOGEY"" → Y excluded.
""FOGEY"" → Y excluded.
""GOUGE"" → G, U, G, E → pattern G O U G E → O is position 2, but we know O must be position 3. So this doesn't fit.

Wait, let's list valid 5-letter words with pattern _ _ O _ E using allowed letters.

Allowed letters (not excluded): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Possible combinations:
- C, L, O, V, E → CLOVE
- C, H, O, W, E → CHOKE → but K is allowed, W is allowed
- C, H, O, T, E → CHOTE (invalid)
- C, H, O, P, E → CHODE (invalid)
- C, H, O, K, E → CHOKE (valid word)
- C, H, O, G, E → CHOGE (invalid)
- C, H, O, F, E → CHOFFE (invalid)
- C, L, O, K, E → CLOKE (invalid)
- C, L, O, P, E → CLOPE (invalid)
- C, L, O, T, E → CLOTE (invalid)
- C, L, O, V, E → CLOVE (valid)
- C, L, O, U, E → CLOUE (invalid)
- C, L, O, W, E → CLOWE (invalid)
- C, L, O, X, E → CLOXE (invalid)
- C, L, O, Z, E → CLOZE (valid, but rare)
- C, L, O, I, E → CLOIE (invalid)

- C, L, O, Z, E → CLOZE (valid)
- C, L, O, I, E → CLOIE (invalid)
- C, L, O, D, E → CLODE (valid)

Between CLOVE, CHOKE, and CLOZE, CHOKE seems the most common.

CHOKE:
- C (new)
- H (new)
- O (correct position 3)
- K (new)
- E (correct position 5)

This tests three new letters (C, H, K) while maintaining the known pattern. This seems optimal.

Let's verify CHOKE is a valid word: yes, ""choke"" is a valid 5-letter English word.

Therefore, the next guess should be CHOKE.
</think>

Based on the feedback, we know:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ E (positions 3 and 5 are O and E respectively).
- Excluded letters: A, R, S, M, N, Y.
- We need to test new common letters like C, H, K.

<guess>CHOKE</guess>",CHOKE,"Let's process the new feedback for MONEY:

- M(x) → M is NOT in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (since in MONEY it was in position 2, but the feedback says it's in the word but wrong position).
- N(x) → N is NOT in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (since in MONEY it was in position 4, but the feedback says it's in the word but wrong position).
- Y(x) → Y is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ _ _ (but we have O and E somewhere, and they are NOT in positions 2 and 4 respectively).
- Excluded letters: A, R, S, M, N, Y.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4.

We also know from Guess 1 that:
- O was in position 3 and was ✓ (correct), but now in Guess 2 it's in position 2 and is (-) (wrong position). This seems contradictory unless the feedback is per-guess. Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.

Wait, the feedback for Guess 1 (AROSE) was:
A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)

This means:
- O is in the correct position (position 3).
- E is in the correct position (position 5).

The feedback for Guess 2 (MONEY) was:
M(x) O(-) N(x) E(-) Y(x)

This means:
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (since in MONEY it was in position 2, but feedback says wrong position).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (since in MONEY it was in position 4, but feedback says wrong position).

But from Guess 1 we already know E is in position 5. So the feedback for MONEY's E in position 4 being wrong is consistent (it's actually in position 5). Similarly, O in Guess 1 was in position 3 (correct), so in MONEY it's in position 2 (wrong position), which is fine.

So current constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ E (from Guess 1)
- Excluded letters: A, R, S, M, N, Y
- O is in position 3 (confirmed by Guess 1)
- E is in position 5 (confirmed by Guess 1)
- Letters not yet tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word with pattern _ _ O _ E, using only allowed letters.

Possible words:
- BLOKE → B, L, O, K, E → but O is position 3, E is position 5 → pattern _ _ O K E → but we need _ _ O _ E → this doesn't fit.
- CLOKE → but ""clove"" is 5 letters, but CLOVE has O in position 3 and E in position 5 → pattern C L O V E → this fits _ _ O _ E (positions: C(1), L(2), O(3), V(4), E(5)).

But let's verify:
CLOVE:
- C (new)
- L (new)
- O (correct position 3)
- V (new)
- E (correct position 5)

This tests C, L, V while maintaining the known pattern. However, ""clove"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""DOPEY"" → but Y is excluded.
""FOGEY"" → Y excluded.
""GOUGE"" → G, U, G, E → but G is repeated, and U is new.
""BOGEY"" → same issue with Y.
""BOOZE"" → Z is new, but O is repeated (position 3 already has O, but pattern allows repeats? Actually, the pattern is _ _ O _ E, so position 3 is O, position 4 can't be O because E is in 5, but ""booze"" has O in 3 and 4, which would conflict with pattern _ _ O _ E (position 4 would be O, but E is in 5, so pattern is _ _ O O E which is invalid).

Wait, the pattern is _ _ O _ E, so position 4 must be a different letter. So ""booze"" is invalid.

Another option: ""COVEY"" → C, O, V, E, Y → Y is excluded.
""DOVER"" → R is excluded.
""LOUSE"" → S is excluded.
""POKE"" is 4 letters.
""BOGEY"" → Y excluded.
""FOGEY"" → Y excluded.
""GOUGE"" → G, U, G, E → pattern G O U G E → O is position 2, but we know O must be position 3. So this doesn't fit.

Wait, let's list valid 5-letter words with pattern _ _ O _ E using allowed letters.

Allowed letters (not excluded): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm several possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct letters to maximize the information gained.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This will give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but ""AROSE"" might be slightly better due to the higher frequency of A, R, O, S, E. After considering various options, ""AROSE"" seems like the optimal first guess to gather maximum information.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ O _ E, and it definitely does NOT contain A, R, or S.

Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

To maximize information, pick a word that:
1. Keeps the known pattern _ _ O _ E.
2. Introduces new common letters not yet tested (e.g., T, L, N, C, H, I, etc.).
3. Avoids any already excluded letters (A, R, S).

Good candidates:
- ""COUNT"" → C, O, U, N, T (but O is already fixed in 3rd place, so pattern would be _ U O _ T → doesn't match _ _ O _ E)
- ""CHOKE"" → C, H, O, K, E (but pattern would be C H O K E → matches _ _ O _ E)
- ""MONEY"" → M, O, N, E, Y (pattern M _ O N E → matches _ _ O _ E)
- ""TONEY"" → T, O, N, E, Y (pattern T _ O N E → matches _ _ O _ N E, but N is 4th here)
- ""LONEY"" → L, O, N, E, Y (pattern L _ O N E → matches _ _ O _ N E)

Among these, ""CHOKE"" is appealing because it tests C, H, K while fitting the pattern C H O K E. However, let's verify:
- C (new letter)
- H (new letter)
- O (known correct)
- K (new letter)
- E (known correct)

This tests three new letters (C, H, K) while maintaining the known pattern. Another good option is ""MONEY"" which tests M, N, Y.

Between CHOKE and MONEY, I'll go with MONEY as it tests M, N, Y which are all common and useful letters.

Guess 2: MONEY -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) N(x) E(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's process the new feedback for MONEY:

- M(x) → M is NOT in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (since in MONEY it was in position 2, but the feedback says it's in the word but wrong position).
- N(x) → N is NOT in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (since in MONEY it was in position 4, but the feedback says it's in the word but wrong position).
- Y(x) → Y is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ _ _ _ (but we have O and E somewhere, and they are NOT in positions 2 and 4 respectively).
- Excluded letters: A, R, S, M, N, Y.
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4.

We also know from Guess 1 that:
- O was in position 3 and was ✓ (correct), but now in Guess 2 it's in position 2 and is (-) (wrong position). This seems contradictory unless the feedback is per-guess. Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.

Wait, the feedback for Guess 1 (AROSE) was:
A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)

This means:
- O is in the correct position (position 3).
- E is in the correct position (position 5).

The feedback for Guess 2 (MONEY) was:
M(x) O(-) N(x) E(-) Y(x)

This means:
- O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (since in MONEY it was in position 2, but feedback says wrong position).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (since in MONEY it was in position 4, but feedback says wrong position).

But from Guess 1 we already know E is in position 5. So the feedback for MONEY's E in position 4 being wrong is consistent (it's actually in position 5). Similarly, O in Guess 1 was in position 3 (correct), so in MONEY it's in position 2 (wrong position), which is fine.

So current constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ E (from Guess 1)
- Excluded letters: A, R, S, M, N, Y
- O is in position 3 (confirmed by Guess 1)
- E is in position 5 (confirmed by Guess 1)
- Letters not yet tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word with pattern _ _ O _ E, using only allowed letters.

Possible words:
- BLOKE → B, L, O, K, E → but O is position 3, E is position 5 → pattern _ _ O K E → but we need _ _ O _ E → this doesn't fit.
- CLOKE → but ""clove"" is 5 letters, but CLOVE has O in position 3 and E in position 5 → pattern C L O V E → this fits _ _ O _ E (positions: C(1), L(2), O(3), V(4), E(5)).

But let's verify:
CLOVE:
- C (new)
- L (new)
- O (correct position 3)
- V (new)
- E (correct position 5)

This tests C, L, V while maintaining the known pattern. However, ""clove"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""DOPEY"" → but Y is excluded.
""FOGEY"" → Y excluded.
""GOUGE"" → G, U, G, E → but G is repeated, and U is new.
""BOGEY"" → same issue with Y.
""BOOZE"" → Z is new, but O is repeated (position 3 already has O, but pattern allows repeats? Actually, the pattern is _ _ O _ E, so position 3 is O, position 4 can't be O because E is in 5, but ""booze"" has O in 3 and 4, which would conflict with pattern _ _ O _ E (position 4 would be O, but E is in 5, so pattern is _ _ O O E which is invalid).

Wait, the pattern is _ _ O _ E, so position 4 must be a different letter. So ""booze"" is invalid.

""DOVER"" → R is excluded.
""LOUSE"" → S is excluded.
""POKE"" is 4 letters.

""FOGEY"" → Y excluded.
""GOUGE"" → G, U, G, E → pattern G O U G E → O is position 2, but we know O must be position 3. So this doesn't fit.

Allowed letters (not excluded): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Between CLOVE, CHOKE, and CLOZE, CHOKE seems the most common.

Similarly, O in Guess 1 was in position 3 (correct), so in MONEY it\'s in position 2 (wrong position), which is fine.\n\nSo current constraints:\n- Pattern: _ _ O _ E (from Guess 1)\n- Excluded letters: A, R, S, M, N, Y\n- O is in position 3 (confirmed by Guess 1)\n- E is in position 5 (confirmed by Guess 1)\n- Letters not yet tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z\n\nWe need a 5-letter word with pattern _ _ O _ E, using only allowed letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- BLOKE → B, L, O, K, E → but O is position 3, E is position 5 → pattern _ _ O K E → but we need _ _ O _ E → this doesn\'t fit.\n- CLOKE → but ""clove"" is 5 letters, but CLOVE has O in position 3 and E in position 5 → pattern C L O V E → this fits _ _ O _ E (positions: C(1), L(2), O(3), V(4), E(5)).\n\nBut let\'s verify:\nCLOVE:\n- C (new)\n- L (new)\n- O (correct position 3)\n- V (new)\n- E (correct position 5)\n\nThis tests C, L, V while maintaining the known pattern. However, ""clove"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother option: ""DOPEY"" → but Y is excluded.\n""FOGEY"" → Y excluded.\n""GOUGE"" → G, U, G, E → but G is repeated, and U is new.\n""BOGEY"" → same issue with Y.\n""BOOZE"" → Z is new, but O is repeated (position 3 already has O, but pattern allows repeats? Actually, the pattern is _ _ O _ E, so position 3 is O, position 4 can\'t be O because E is in 5, but ""booze"" has O in 3 and 4, which would conflict with pattern _ _ O _ E (position 4 would be O, but E is in 5, so pattern is _ _ O O E which is invalid).\n\nWait, the pattern is _ _ O _ E, so position 4 must be a different letter. So ""booze"" is invalid.\n\nAnother option: ""COVEY"" → C, O, V, E, Y → Y is excluded.\n""DOVER"" → R is excluded.\n""LOUSE"" → S is excluded.\n""POKE"" is 4 letters.\n""BOGEY"" → Y excluded.\n""FOGEY"" → Y excluded.\n""GOUGE"" → G, U, G, E → pattern G O U G E → O is position 2, but we know O must be position 3. So this doesn\'t fit.\n\nWait, let\'s list valid 5-letter words with pattern _ _ O _ E using allowed letters.\n\nAllowed letters (not excluded): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nPossible combinations:\n- C, L, O, V, E → CLOVE\n- C, H, O, W, E → CHOKE → but K is allowed, W is allowed\n- C, H, O, T, E → CHOTE (invalid)\n- C, H, O, P, E → CHODE (invalid)\n- C, H, O, K, E → CHOKE (valid word)\n- C, H, O, G, E → CHOGE (invalid)\n- C, H, O, F, E → CHOFFE (invalid)\n- C, L, O, K, E → CLOKE (invalid)\n- C, L, O, P, E → CLOPE (invalid)\n- C, L, O, T, E → CLOTE (invalid)\n- C, L, O, V, E → CLOVE (valid)\n- C, L, O, U, E → CLOUE (invalid)\n- C, L, O, W, E → CLOWE (invalid)\n- C, L, O, X, E → CLOXE (invalid)\n- C, L, O, Z, E → CLOZE (valid, but rare)\n- C, L, O, I, E → CLOIE (invalid)\n- C, L, O, D, E → CLODE (valid, but ""clove"" is more common)\n- C, L, O, B, E → CLOBE (invalid)\n- C, L, O, H, E → CLOHE (invalid)\n- C, L, O, J, E → CLOJE (invalid)\n- C, L, O, P, E → CLOPE (invalid)\n- C, L, O, R, E → R is excluded\n- C, L, O, S, E → S is excluded\n- C, L, O, T, E → CLOTE (invalid)\n- C, L, O, U, E → CLOUE (invalid)\n- C, L, O, V, E → CLOVE (valid)\n- C, L, O, W, E → CLOWE (invalid)\n- C, L, O, X, E → CLOXE (invalid)\n- C, L, O, Z, E → CLOZE (valid)\n- C, L, O, I, E → CLOIE (invalid)\n- C, L, O, D, E → CLODE (valid)\n\nBetween CLOVE, CHOKE, and CLOZE, CHOKE seems the most common.\n\nCHOKE:\n- C (new)\n- H (new)\n- O (correct position 3)\n- K (new)\n- E (correct position 5)\n\nThis tests three new letters (C, H, K) while maintaining the known pattern. This seems optimal.\n\nLet\'s verify CHOKE is a valid word: yes, ""choke"" is a valid 5-letter English word.\n\nTherefore, the next guess should be CHOKE.Based on the feedback, we know:\n- Pattern: _ _ O _ E (positions 3 and 5 are O and E respectively).\n- Excluded letters: A, R, S, M, N, Y.\n- We need to test new common letters like C, H, K.\n\n<guess>CHOKE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: MONEY -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) N(x) E(-) Y(x)\nGuess 3: CHOKE -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(x) O(✓) K(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the new feedback on CHOKE:

- C(✓) → C is in the word and in the correct position (1st letter).
- H(x) → H is NOT in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- K(x) → K is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).

So the pattern is now: C _ O _ E.

Excluded letters so far: A, R, S, M, N, Y, H, K.

Allowed letters (not yet excluded): B, D, F, G, I, J, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form C _ O _ E. Possible letters for positions 2 and 4 from the allowed list.

Looking for common words:
- C B O D E → ""cbo de"" (invalid)
- C L O V E → ""clove"" (valid, uses L and V)
- C L O P E → ""clope"" (invalid)
- C L O T E → ""clo te"" (invalid)
- C T O D E → ""ctode"" (invalid)
- C T O P E → ""ctope"" (invalid)
- C T O V E → ""ctove"" (invalid)
- C B O T E → ""cbote"" (invalid)
- C L O V E is the only valid word that fits.

""clove"" uses L and V, both allowed and not yet excluded. Let's verify:
- C (position 1) ✓
- L (position 2) new
- O (position 3) ✓
- V (position 4) new
- E (position 5) ✓

This tests L and V, both new letters, and fits the pattern C _ O _ E.
