2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A good starting word should ideally have:

1. Multiple vowels to test common vowels
2. Common consonants
3. No repeated letters to test as many unique letters as possible

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (high vowel coverage)
- AUDIO (high vowel coverage)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers five very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and gives good coverage of consonants and vowels.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- L(x) → L is NOT in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position.
- T(x) → T is NOT in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and E (but A is not in position 3, E is not in position 5).
- Does NOT contain S, L, or T.

We need a 5-letter word that uses A and E in different positions and avoids S, L, T.

Good next guesses should:
1. Use A and E (but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively).
2. Avoid S, L, T.
3. Introduce new common letters to test.

Possible new letters to test: R, N, C, H, M, P, etc.

Let’s try “CRANE”:
- C, R, A, N, E.
- A is in position 3 → but we know A is not in position 3 from SLATE feedback. So CRANE is bad because it puts A in position 3.

Next try “CHARE”:
- C, H, A, R, E.
- A is in position 3 → again bad.

Try “EARLY”:
- E, A, R, L, Y.
- L is not in the word (from SLATE feedback). So EARLY is bad.

Try “EARNE”:
- E, A, R, N, E.
- A is in position 2 (good, not 3), E is in position 1 and 5 (but we know E is not in position 5 from SLATE). So EARNE is bad because E is in position 5.

Try “EARTH”:
- E, A, R, T, H.
- T is not in the word (from SLATE). So EARTH is bad.

Try “EAGER”:
- E, A, G, E, R.
- A is in position 2 (good), E is in positions 1 and 4 (good, not 5). This avoids S, L, T and tests new letters G and R.

So we now know the exact pattern: _ A _ E R  
Letters we know are in the word: A, E, R  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, L, T, G  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2
- Has E in position 4
- Has R in position 5
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, G
- Uses only valid letters

Possible first letters (position 1): Any letter except S, L, T, G, A, E, R (since those are already placed or ruled out). Good candidates: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible third letter (position 3): Any letter except S, L, T, G, A, E, R. Good candidates: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s brainstorm words that fit _ A _ E R:
- B A C E R → ""BACER"" – not a valid word
- B A D E R → ""BAKER"" – but K is allowed, R is already in position 5 – ""BAKER"" has R in position 5, but E is in position 4, A in 2 – ""BAKER"" is B A K E R – this fits! But we need to check if K is allowed (it’s not ruled out). However, ""BAKER"" has K in position 3 – is K allowed? Yes, it’s not in the ruled-out list.
- C A B E R → ""CABER"" – valid word
- C A D E R → ""CADER"" – not common
- F A C E R → ""FACER"" – valid
- H A C E R → ""HACER"" – valid (Spanish loanword, but acceptable in English Scrabble lists)
- M A C E R → ""MACER"" – not common
- N A V E R → ""NAVER"" – not common
- P A C E R → ""PACER"" – valid
- V A C E R → ""VACER"" – not common

Among these, ""BAKER"", ""CABER"", ""FACER"", ""HACER"", ""PACER"" are all valid. ""BAKER"" is the most common word, so let's try it first.

However, we should also check if any of these have letters we've ruled out:
- BAKER: B, A, K, E, R – all allowed
- CABER: C, A, B, E, R – all allowed
- FACER: F, A, C, E, R – all allowed
- HACER: H, A, C, E, R – all allowed
- PACER: P, A, C, E, R – all allowed

Any of these would work, but ""BAKER"" is the most common word. Let's go with that.

But wait – let me double-check ""BAKER"":
- B (position 1) – allowed
- A (position 2) – matches ✓
- K (position 3) – allowed
- E (position 4) – matches ✓
- R (position 5) – matches ✓

This fits all constraints.
