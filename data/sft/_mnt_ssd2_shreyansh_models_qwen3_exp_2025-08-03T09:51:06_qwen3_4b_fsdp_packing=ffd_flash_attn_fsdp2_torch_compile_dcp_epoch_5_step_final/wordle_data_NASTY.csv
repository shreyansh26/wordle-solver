### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x): R is not in the word.
- O(x): O is not in the word.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely absent: R, O, E
- Letters definitely present: A, S
- A is not in position 1
- S is not in position 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S
2. Does NOT contain R, O, E
3. A is not in position 1
4. S is not in position 4

Good candidate letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

I’ll look for a word that uses A and S and common remaining letters. ""STAIN"" comes to mind, but it has an I and N which are common. However, S is in position 1 here, which is allowed since the feedback only said S is not in position 4. Let me check:
- S in position 1: allowed
- T: new letter
- A: position 3 (allowed, since A is not in position 1)
- I: new letter
- N: new letter

This seems like a good second guess to test new letters while keeping A and S.

Let’s summarize what we now know from both guesses.

Letters that are definitely NOT in the secret word: R, O, E, I.

Letters that ARE in the secret word (but whose positions we still need to pin down): A, S, T, N.

Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in position 1 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 3 (from STAIN).
- S cannot be in position 4 (from AROSE) and cannot be in position 1 (from STAIN).
- T cannot be in position 2 (from STAIN).
- N cannot be in position 5 (from STAIN).

Remaining positions for each letter:
A: 2, 4, 5
S: 2, 3, 5
T: 1, 3, 4, 5
N: 1, 2, 3, 4

We need a 5-letter word that contains A, S, T, N (and one more letter that is NOT R, O, E, I). The remaining unused common consonants are B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to build a word that satisfies all constraints. One systematic way is to pick a word that reuses the known letters in new positions and introduces one new letter. A good candidate is “SANTa” but “SANTA” is invalid (contains A twice). Another is “STAND”:
- S: position 1 – but S cannot be in position 1 (from STAIN feedback). So this is invalid.
Next: “TASAN” – invalid (not a valid word).
Next: “NASTY” – contains Y (new letter), and positions:
N:1 (allowed)
A:2 (allowed)
S:3 (allowed)
T:4 (allowed)
Y:5 (new, allowed)
This looks valid and tests new positions for A, S, T, N plus a new letter Y.

Let’s check:
- Contains A, S, T, N: yes.
- Does not contain R, O, E, I: yes.
- Positions:
  – A is in 2: allowed (not 1 or 3)
  – S is in 3: allowed (not 1 or 4)
  – T is in 4: allowed (not 2)
  – N is in 1: allowed (not 5)
  – Y is new: allowed
