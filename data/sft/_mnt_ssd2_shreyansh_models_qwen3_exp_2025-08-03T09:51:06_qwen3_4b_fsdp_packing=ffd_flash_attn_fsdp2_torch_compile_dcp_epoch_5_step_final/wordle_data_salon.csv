### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. A good starting word should have a mix of these letters to quickly identify which are in the secret word.

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- ROAST (contains R, O, A, S, T)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it's widely considered one of the best starting words due to its use of very common letters and good coverage of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T and E are not in the word (x)

So the secret word starts with S and contains L and A somewhere in positions 2-5, but not in their original positions (L not in 2nd, A not in 3rd). We also know T and E are absent.

Next, I want to test new consonants and vowels to narrow down possibilities. I'll try to place L and A in different spots while introducing other common letters. A good candidate is ""SHALL"":
- Keeps S in first position.
- Moves L to 4th and 5th, testing both positions.
- Introduces H and another L to see if it fits.

From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - Word pattern: S _ _ _ _
   - Letters in the word: S, L, A
   - Letters not in the word: T, E, H

2. SHALL → S(✓) H(x) A(-) L(-) L(-)
   - H is definitely NOT in the word (x).
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
   - L is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (-).

So we know:
- Word starts with S
- Must contain A and L somewhere in positions 2-5
- A cannot be in position 3
- L cannot be in positions 4 or 5
- Forbidden letters: T, E, H

Possible positions for A: 2, 4, 5
Possible positions for L: 2, 3

Let's try to place A and L in valid spots while introducing new common letters. A good candidate is ""SCALE"":
- S(✓) in position 1
- C is new
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- L in position 3 (allowed)
- E is forbidden (from SLATE feedback), so SCALE is invalid.

Next candidate: ""SALSA"":
- S(✓) in 1
- A in 2
- L in 3
- S in 4 (but S is already used)
- A in 5
But this repeats S and A, and we don't know if duplicates are allowed (Wordle typically has unique letters). Let's try ""SALSA"" anyway to check.

But ""SALSA"" has S twice, which might not be optimal. Better to use unique letters.

Next: ""SALAD"":
- S(✓) in 1
- A in 2
- L in 3
- A in 4 (duplicate A)
- D is new
This has duplicate A, which might not be useful.

Next: ""SALON"":
- S(✓) in 1
- A in 2
- L in 3
- O is new
- N is new
This seems good - unique letters, places A in 2 and L in 3, introduces O and N.

Let's verify:
- S _ _ _ _ (correct)
- A in 2 (allowed)
- L in 3 (allowed)
- New letters O and N
- No forbidden letters (T, E, H)

This seems optimal.
