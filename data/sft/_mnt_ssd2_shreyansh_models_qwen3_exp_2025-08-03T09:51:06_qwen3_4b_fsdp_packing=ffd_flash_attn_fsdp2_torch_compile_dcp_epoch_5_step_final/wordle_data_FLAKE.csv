### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities at once. A good strategy is to use vowels and frequently occurring consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This can provide useful information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Remaining consonants to try: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

A good strategy is to use vowels and frequently occurring consonants.

From the new feedback on PLANE:

P(x) L(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)

- E is still in position 5 (✓).
- A is now confirmed to be in position 3 (✓).
- L is confirmed to be in position 2 (✓).
- P and N are not in the word (x).

So the pattern is now:
_ L A _ E

Letters still unknown: positions 1 and 4.
Letters already excluded: R, O, S, T, B, P, N.
Remaining common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A and E are used, and O is out).

Possible combinations:
- Position 1: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y
- Position 4: I, U or any remaining consonant

Looking for valid words that fit _ L A _ E:
- CLADE (but D is okay, C is okay) – but A is in position 3, so CLADE would be C L A D E – valid.
- FLAKE – F, L, A, K, E – valid.
- GLADE – G, L, A, D, E – valid.
- SLATE – but S is excluded.
- VLAME – not a word.
- PLATE – P is excluded.

""FLAKE"" uses F, L, A, K, E. All letters fit the constraints:
- F and K are new letters to test.
- L, A, E are already confirmed in positions 2, 3, 5.
- Excludes all known bad letters.

This seems like the best next guess.
