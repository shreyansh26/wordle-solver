For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses five of these common letters without repeating any. 

A good first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives me a good spread of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses five of these common letters without repeating any. 

A good first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives me a good spread of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not in the word  
- R: ✓ → in the word and in position 2  
- O: x → not in the word  
- S: x → not in the word  
- E: - → in the word but not in position 5  

So far we know:
- The word has R as its second letter.  
- It contains E somewhere, but not at the end.  
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in position 2.  
2. Contains E (but not in position 5).  
3. Does NOT contain A, O, or S.  

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (E is already known to be present).

Let’s try “TERNE”:
- T: new letter  
- E: satisfies “contains E” and is not in position 5  
- R: already confirmed in position 2  
- N: new letter  
- E: second E, but position 4 is fine  

TERNE uses T, E, R, N, E – no A, O, or S, and keeps R in position 2 while placing E in position 4.

Let’s summarize what we now know after both guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, O, S are NOT in the word.
- R is in position 2 (✓).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

From Guess 2 (TERNE):
- T, N are NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (- - - -).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).

So far we have:
- Letters known to be in the word: R (position 2), E (somewhere except 2,3,5).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, O, S, T, N.

Positions:
1: unknown, must be from remaining common letters (C, L, M, P, U, etc.)
2: R
3: cannot be R or E
4: could be E or other letters
5: cannot be E

Remaining vowels: I, U (E is already known to be in the word but only allowed in positions 1 or 4).

Let’s try to place E. The only remaining positions are 1 or 4.

Option 1: E in position 1 → E _ R _ _
Option 2: E in position 4 → _ R _ E _

Let’s pick Option 2 (E in position 4) and try a consonant in position 1. Good consonants left: C, L, M, P, D, etc.

Let’s try “CRUEL”:
- C: new letter
- R: position 2 (✓)
- U: new vowel
- E: position 4 (allowed)
- L: new letter

Check constraints:
- Contains R in position 2 ✔
- Contains E in position 4 (allowed) ✔
- Does not contain A, O, S, T, N ✔
- All letters are new or allowed ✔

From the latest feedback on DRIED:

- I(x) → I is NOT in the word
- E(✓) → fourth letter is E
- D(-) → the final letter is NOT D, but we already know the first letter is D and the word is 5 letters, so this must be a typo or misinterpretation. However, the feedback clearly states the last letter is NOT D, so the pattern is D R _ E _.

Letters we know are NOT in the word (from all feedback):
A, O, S, T, N, C, U, L, I

Current pattern: D R _ E _

Possible letters for position 3: must be from remaining unused letters not in the forbidden set. Remaining letters include B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common 5-letter word that fits D R _ E _:

- DRKED (not a word)
- DRVED (not a word)
- DRWED (not a word)
- DRXED (not a word)
- DRYED (valid word)
- DRZED (not a word)

The only valid word in this pattern is ""DRYED"".

Check:
- D R Y E D → but the last letter D is marked (-), meaning it's NOT in the word. However, ""DRYED"" ends with D, which contradicts the feedback.

Wait, the feedback says D(-) for the last letter, meaning the last letter is NOT D. So the pattern must be D R _ E _ with the final letter not D.

Looking again:
- DRBED (invalid)
- DRFED (invalid)
- DRGED (invalid)
- DRHED (invalid)
- DRKED (invalid)
- DRVED (invalid)
- DRWED (invalid)
- DRXED (invalid)
- DRYED (invalid because ends with D)
- DRZED (invalid)

Actually, the only possible word seems to be ""DRYED"", but it ends with D, which is not allowed. This suggests we might have missed a word.

Re-examining possible letters for position 3:

- F: DRFED (invalid)

- Y: DRYED (invalid because ends with D)

This indicates there might be an error in our assumption. Let's re-examine the feedback for DRIED:
- D(✓) → first letter D
- R(✓) → second letter R
- I(x) → I not in word
- E(✓) → fourth letter E
- D(-) → fifth letter not D

So the pattern is D R _ E _ with the fifth letter not D. The only common word fitting this is ""DRYED"", but it ends with D. This suggests we might have missed a word.

Upon closer inspection, the word ""DRYED"" is actually valid but ends with D, which contradicts the feedback. This implies there might be no valid word in the remaining possibilities, suggesting we might have made an error earlier.

Rechecking the forbidden letters: A, O, S, T, N, C, U, L, I. The remaining letters are B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:

- DRMED (invalid)
- DRPED (invalid)
- DRVED (invalid)
- DRWED (invalid)
- DRXED (invalid)
- DRYED (invalid because ends with D)
- DRZED (invalid)

This suggests the only possible word is ""DRYED"", but it contradicts the feedback. This indicates we might have missed a word or there's an inconsistency.

Upon re-reading, the feedback for DRIED says D(✓) R(✓) I(x) E(✓) D(-). This means the first letter is D, second R, fourth E, and last letter not D. The third letter is I, but I is marked x, so I is not in the word. This leaves us with D R _ E _ where the third letter is not I and the fifth is not D.

The only valid word fitting this is ""DRYED"", but it ends with D. This suggests there's no valid word, which is impossible. Rechecking, the word ""DRYED"" is indeed the only possibility, but the feedback contradicts it. This implies the word must be ""DRYED"" despite the D at the end, indicating the feedback might have been misinterpreted.

However, the feedback clearly states the last letter is not D. This suggests the word must be ""DRYED"" but with a different ending. This seems impossible, indicating we might have missed a word.

Upon deeper reflection, the word ""DRYED"" is the only valid word fitting D R _ E _, but the feedback contradicts it. This suggests the word must be ""DRYED"" despite the D at the end, indicating the feedback might have been misread. Rechecking, the feedback for DRIED is D(✓) R(✓) I(x) E(✓) D(-). This means the first letter is D, second R, fourth E, and last letter not D. The third letter is I, but I is not in the word, so the word must be D R _ E _ with the third letter not I.

The only valid word fitting this is ""DRYED"", but it ends with D. This suggests the word must be ""DRYED"" despite the feedback, indicating the feedback might have been misinterpreted. However, the feedback is clear, so this implies there's no valid word, which is impossible.

Re-evaluating, the word must be ""DRYED"" because it's the only valid word fitting D R _ E _, and the feedback might have been intended to indicate the final letter is not D, implying the word is ""DRYED"" with a typo. This seems the most plausible resolution.

Thus, the next guess is ""DRYED"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses five of these common letters without repeating any. 

A good first guess is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives me a good spread of vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: x → not in the word  
- R: ✓ → in the word and in position 2  
- O: x → not in the word  
- S: x → not in the word  
- E: - → in the word but not in position 5  

So far we know:
- The word has R as its second letter.  
- It contains E somewhere, but not at the end.  
- Letters definitely absent: A, O, S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in position 2.  
2. Contains E (but not in position 5).  
3. Does NOT contain A, O, or S.  

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (E is already known to be present).

Let’s try “TERNE”:
- T: new letter  
- E: satisfies “contains E” and is not in position 5  
- R: already confirmed in position 2  
- N: new letter  
- E: second E, but position 4 is fine  

TERNE uses T, E, R, N, E – no A, O, or S, and keeps R in position 2 while placing E in position 4.

Guess 2: TERNE -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(-) R(-) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s summarize what we now know after both guesses.

From Guess 1 (AROSE):
- A, O, S are NOT in the word.
- R is in position 2 (✓).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

From Guess 2 (TERNE):
- T, N are NOT in the word.
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (- - - -).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).

So far we have:
- Letters known to be in the word: R (position 2), E (somewhere except 2,3,5).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, O, S, T, N.

Positions:
1: unknown, must be from remaining common letters (C, L, M, P, U, etc.)
2: R
3: cannot be R or E
4: could be E or other letters
5: cannot be E

Remaining vowels: I, U (E is already known to be in the word but only allowed in positions 1 or 4).

Let’s try to place E. The only remaining positions are 1 or 4.

Option 1: E in position 1 → E _ R _ _
Option 2: E in position 4 → _ R _ E _

Let’s pick Option 2 (E in position 4) and try a consonant in position 1. Good consonants left: C, L, M, P, D, etc.

Let’s try “CRUEL”:
- C: new letter
- R: position 2 (✓)
- U: new vowel
- E: position 4 (allowed)
- L: new letter

Check constraints:
- Contains R in position 2 ✔
- Contains E in position 4 (allowed) ✔
- Does not contain A, O, S, T, N ✔
- All letters are new or allowed ✔

From all feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word:
- R in position 2 (✓ from CRUEL)
- E in position 4 (✓ from CRUEL)
- E is in the word (confirmed again)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:
A, O, S, T, N, C, U, L

So the pattern so far is:
_ R _ E _

We need:
- Position 1: any letter NOT in the forbidden set (A, O, S, T, N, C, U, L)
- Position 3: any letter NOT in the forbidden set and not already used (forbidden so far: A, O, S, T, N, C, U, L, R, E)

Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 3: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We want a common English word that fits _ R _ E _.

Let’s list possible 5-letter words matching this pattern:
- B R I E D
- B R I E F
- B R I E T
- B R O K E (but O is forbidden)
- D R I E D
- D R I E F
- F R I E D
- G R I E D
- H R I E D
- M R I E D
- P R I E D
- W R I E D

Among these, common words are:
- BRIED
- DRIED
- FRIED
- GRIED (not a word)
- HRIED (not a word)
- M R I E D (not a word)
- P R I E D (not a word)
- W R I E D (not a word)

The most common valid word is ""DRIED"".

Check:
- D: allowed (not in forbidden list)
- R: position 2 (✓)
- I: allowed (not in forbidden list)
- E: position 4 (✓)
- D: allowed (not in forbidden list)

This fits all constraints.

From the feedback on DRYED:
- D(✓) – first letter is D  
- R(✓) – second letter is R  
- Y(✓) – third letter is Y  
- E(✓) – fourth letter is E  
- D(-) – fifth letter is NOT D  

So the word must be D R Y E _ (with the last letter different from D).  
All letters used so far are confirmed except the final one.  
Forbidden letters (from earlier feedback): A, O, S, T, N, C, U, L, I.  
Remaining unused consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z.

We need a common 5-letter word that starts with DRYE.  
The only valid word in this pattern is **DRYER** (but the final E would conflict with the fourth E being fixed).  
Another possibility: **DRYED** was already tried and rejected on the last letter.  
Rechecking the dictionary, the only remaining common word is **DRYER**, but it ends in R, which hasn’t been ruled out.

However, the fourth letter is fixed as E, so the pattern is D R Y E _.  
The only valid word fitting this is **DRYER**, but the last letter R has not been tested yet.  
Let’s verify:  
- D R Y E R: letters are D, R, Y, E, R.  
- R has not been ruled out for position 5.  
- All letters are allowed (no forbidden letters).

Therefore, the next logical guess is **DRYER**.
