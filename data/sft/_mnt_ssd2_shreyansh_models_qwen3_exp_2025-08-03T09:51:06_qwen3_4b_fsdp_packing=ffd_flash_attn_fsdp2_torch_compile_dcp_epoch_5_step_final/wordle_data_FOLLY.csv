For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains S, L, A, T, and E - all very common letters. This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

- Does NOT contain S, A, T, E.
- Does contain L, but not in position 2.

I need a new 5-letter word that:

- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

Let me try a word like ""FLING"":
- F, L, I, N, G.
- L is in position 2 here, but we know L is not in position 2 from the feedback. So this is bad.

Another option: ""CRONY"":
- C, R, O, N, Y.
- Doesn't include L, so we lose the info about L. Not ideal.

Better: ""CLIMB"":
- C, L, I, M, B.
- L is in position 2 again. Not allowed.

Next: ""PLUMB"":

- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- T(x) → T is NOT in the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, A, T, E.
- Does contain L, but not in position 2.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes L (but not in position 2).
- Excludes S, A, T, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

Let me try a word like ""FLING"":
- F, L, I, N, G.
- L is in position 2 here, but we know L is not in position 2 from the feedback. So this is bad.

Another option: ""CRONY"":
- C, R, O, N, Y.
- Doesn't include L, so we lose the info about L. Not ideal.

Better: ""CLIMB"":
- C, L, I, M, B.
- L is in position 2 again. Not allowed.

Next: ""PLUMB"":
- P, L, U, M, B.
- L is in position 2. Not allowed.

""GLIMP"":
- G, L, I, M, P.
- L is in position 2. Not allowed.

""BRICK"":
- B, R, I, C, K.
- No L. Not ideal.

""BLIMP"":
- B, L, I, M, P.
- L is in position 2. Not allowed.

""FLICK"":
- F, L, I, C, K.
- L is in position 2. Not allowed.

""CLIMB"" is same issue.

Let me try ""PRIMO"":
- P, R, I, M, O.
- No L. Not ideal.

""PLUMB"" is same issue.

""CLIMB"" is same issue.

""BLIMP"" same.

""FLING"" same.

""CRONY"" no L.

""DRILL"":
- D, R, I, L, L.
- L is in positions 4 and 5. That's allowed (not position 2). This seems good.

Let me check: D, R, I, L, L.
- Contains L (positions 4 and 5, so not position 2).
- Excludes S, A, T, E.
- Uses common letters D, R, I, L, L.

This seems like a strong second guess.

So the secret word:

- Does NOT contain S, A, T, E, D, R, I.
- Remaining letters to consider: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with L in the 4th position and none of the excluded letters. Let’s list possible patterns: _ _ _ L _

Good consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, W, Y, etc.
Good vowels left: O, U (since A, E, I are out).

Let’s try to find a word that fits _ _ _ L _ with these constraints.

Possible candidates:
- BLOWY → contains W and Y, but O is allowed. But W and Y might be too obscure.

Let’s digest the new feedback on CLOWN:

- C(x) → C is NOT in the word.
- L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (we already know L is in position 4 from DRILL, so this is consistent).
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- W(x) → W is NOT in the word.
- N(x) → N is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Must have L in position 4 (from DRILL).
- Must contain O somewhere, but NOT in position 3.
- Cannot contain S, A, T, E, D, R, I, C, W, N.

Remaining consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.
Remaining vowels: O (already confirmed), U (since A, E, I are out).

Pattern so far: _ _ _ L _

O must appear in position 1, 2, or 5.

Let’s list possible words:
- If O is in position 1: O _ _ L _
  Possible: O B _ L _ → O B L L _ → but L is already in position 4, so O B L L _ → needs 5th letter. O B L L _ → O B L L Y (OBLLY – not a word). O B L L _ → O B L L _ → no common word.
  O M _ L _ → O M B L _ → OMBLY – no.
  O M P L _ → OMPLE – no.
  O M P L Y – OMPLY – no.
  O M P L _ → no.

  P _ _ L O → P U B L O → PUBLO – no.
  V _ _ L O → V U M L O →VUMLO – no.
  B _ _ L O → B U M L O – none are valid.

Let me rethink: perhaps O is in position 1, 2, or 5, but I need common words.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words with pattern _ _ _ L O, using allowed letters.

Allowed letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z, O, U.

Common words ending in LO:
- BLOWY – contains W (invalid).
- CLOWN – already used.
- FLOCK – contains C (invalid).
- GLOOM – contains C (invalid).
- HULLO – contains H, U, L, L, O – but L is in position 4, so H U L L O → positions: H(1), U(2), L(3), L(4), O(5). But we know L must be in position 4, so this would require L in position 3 and 4, which is impossible. So HULLO is invalid.
- JOLLY – contains J, O, L, L, Y. Pattern: J(1), O(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5). Here L is in position 4 (✓), O is in position 2 (allowed, since O must be somewhere but not in position 3). Letters: J, O, L, Y are allowed. This seems valid.

Check JOLLY:
- J: allowed (not in excluded list).
- O: allowed, in position 2 (not 3).
- L: in position 4 (✓).
- L: in position 3 – but we already know L is in position 4, so this is fine (two L’s possible).
- Y: allowed.

But JOLLY has two L’s: positions 3 and 4. Is this possible? The secret word could have two L’s, one in position 4 and another elsewhere. The feedback didn’t forbid duplicates.

Another candidate: MOLLY – same issue, M, O, L, L, Y. L in position 4, O in position 2. Also valid.

Between JOLLY and MOLLY, JOLLY is more common.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains S, L, A, T, and E - all very common letters. This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- T(x) → T is NOT in the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, A, T, E.
- Does contain L, but not in position 2.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes L (but not in position 2).
- Excludes S, A, T, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

Let me try a word like ""FLING"":
- F, L, I, N, G.
- L is in position 2 here, but we know L is not in position 2 from the feedback. So this is bad.

Another option: ""CRONY"":
- C, R, O, N, Y.
- Doesn't include L, so we lose the info about L. Not ideal.

Better: ""CLIMB"":
- C, L, I, M, B.
- L is in position 2 again. Not allowed.

Next: ""PLUMB"":
- P, L, U, M, B.
- L is in position 2. Not allowed.

""GLIMP"":
- G, L, I, M, P.
- L is in position 2. Not allowed.

""BRICK"":

""BLIMP"":
- B, L, I, M, P.
- L is in position 2. Not allowed.

- Contains L (positions 4 and 5, so not position 2).

- Remaining letters to consider: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible candidates:
- BLOWY → contains W and Y, but O is allowed. But W and Y might be too obscure.
- CLOWN → C, L, O, W, N. All letters are allowed (C, O, W, N not excluded yet). L is in position 4. This seems good.
- GLOOM → G, L, O, O, M. O is allowed, G, M are allowed. L is in position 4. This also looks good.
- HULLO → H, U, L, L, O. U is allowed, H, O are allowed. L is in position 4. This works too.

Among these, CLOWN uses common letters and is a valid word. Let’s go with CLOWN.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: DRILL -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(x) I(x) L(✓) L(-)
Guess 3: CLOWN -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) O(-) W(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s digest the new feedback on CLOWN:

- C(x) → C is NOT in the word.
- L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (we already know L is in position 4 from DRILL, so this is consistent).
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- W(x) → W is NOT in the word.
- N(x) → N is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Must have L in position 4 (from DRILL).
- Must contain O somewhere, but NOT in position 3.
- Cannot contain S, A, T, E, D, R, I, C, W, N.

Remaining consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.
Remaining vowels: O (already confirmed), U (since A, E, I are out).

Pattern so far: _ _ _ L _

O must appear in position 1, 2, or 5.

Let’s list possible words:
- If O is in position 1: O _ _ L _
  Possible: O B _ L _ → O B L L _ → but L is already in position 4, so O B L L _ → needs 5th letter. O B L L _ → O B L L Y (OBLLY – not a word). O B L L _ → O B L L _ → no common word.
  O M _ L _ → O M B L _ → OMBLY – no.
  O M P L _ → OMPLE – no.
  O M P L Y – OMPLY – no.
  O M P L _ → no.

- If O is in position 2: _ O _ L _
  Possible: B O _ L _ → B O M L Y → BO MLY – no.
  F O _ L _ → F O G L Y → FOGLY – no.
  G O _ L _ → G O M L Y → GOMLY – no.
  H O _ L _ → H O M L Y → HOMLY – no.
  M O _ L _ → M O B L Y → MOBLY – no.
  P O _ L _ → P O M L Y → POMLY – no.
  V O _ L _ → V O M L Y → VOMLY – no.

- If O is in position 5: _ _ _ L O
  Possible: B _ _ L O → B U M L O →BUMLO – no.
  F _ _ L O → F U M L O →FUMLO – no.
  G _ _ L O → G U M L O →GUMLO – no.
  H _ _ L O → H U M L O →HUMLO – no.
  M _ _ L O → M U B L O →MUBLO – no.
  P _ _ L O → P U B L O → PUBLO – no.
  V _ _ L O → V U M L O →VUMLO – no.
  B _ _ L O → B U M L O – none are valid.

Let me rethink: perhaps O is in position 1, 2, or 5, but I need common words.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words with pattern _ _ _ L O, using allowed letters.

Allowed letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z, O, U.

Common words ending in LO:
- BLOWY – contains W (invalid).
- CLOWN – already used.
- FLOCK – contains C (invalid).
- GLOOM – contains C (invalid).
- HULLO – contains H, U, L, L, O – but L is in position 4, so H U L L O → positions: H(1), U(2), L(3), L(4), O(5). But we know L must be in position 4, so this would require L in position 3 and 4, which is impossible. So HULLO is invalid.
- JOLLY – contains J, O, L, L, Y. Pattern: J(1), O(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5). Here L is in position 4 (✓), O is in position 2 (allowed, since O must be somewhere but not in position 3). Letters: J, O, L, Y are allowed. This seems valid.

Check JOLLY:
- J: allowed (not in excluded list).
- O: allowed, in position 2 (not 3).
- L: in position 4 (✓).
- L: in position 3 – but we already know L is in position 4, so this is fine (two L’s possible).
- Y: allowed.

But JOLLY has two L’s: positions 3 and 4. Is this possible? The secret word could have two L’s, one in position 4 and another elsewhere. The feedback didn’t forbid duplicates.

Another candidate: MOLLY – same issue, M, O, L, L, Y. L in position 4, O in position 2. Also valid.

Between JOLLY and MOLLY, JOLLY is more common.

Let’s try JOLLY.Based on the feedback, the word must have:
- L in position 4.
- O somewhere, but not in position 3.
- Excluded letters: S, A, T, E, D, R, I, C, W, N.

A valid word fitting these constraints is JOLLY.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains S, L, A, T, and E - all very common letters. This should give me good information about which letters are present and their possible positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- T(x) → T is NOT in the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, A, T, E.
- Does contain L, but not in position 2.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes L (but not in position 2).
- Excludes S, A, T, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

Let me try a word like ""FLING"":
- F, L, I, N, G.
- L is in position 2 here, but we know L is not in position 2 from the feedback. So this is bad.

Another option: ""CRONY"":
- C, R, O, N, Y.
- Doesn't include L, so we lose the info about L. Not ideal.

Better: ""CLIMB"":
- C, L, I, M, B.
- L is in position 2 again. Not allowed.

Next: ""PLUMB"":
- P, L, U, M, B.
- L is in position 2. Not allowed.

""GLIMP"":
- G, L, I, M, P.
- L is in position 2. Not allowed.

""BRICK"":

""BLIMP"":

- L is in position 2. Not allowed.

""FLICK"":
- F, L, I, C, K.
- L is in position 2. Not allowed.

""CLIMB"" is same issue.

""PLUMB"" is same issue.

""CLIMB"" is same issue.

""FLING"" same.

""CRONY"" no L.

""DRILL"":

Let me check: D, R, I, L, L.
- Contains L (positions 4 and 5, so not position 2).

- Does NOT contain S, A, T, E, D, R, I.
- Remaining letters to consider: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with L in the 4th position and none of the excluded letters. Let’s list possible patterns: _ _ _ L _

Good consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, W, Y, etc.
Good vowels left: O, U (since A, E, I are out).

Let’s try to find a word that fits _ _ _ L _ with these constraints.

Possible candidates:
- BLOWY → contains W and Y, but O is allowed. But W and Y might be too obscure.
- CLOWN → C, L, O, W, N. All letters are allowed (C, O, W, N not excluded yet). L is in position 4. This seems good.

- HULLO → H, U, L, L, O. U is allowed, H, O are allowed. L is in position 4. This works too.

Among these, CLOWN uses common letters and is a valid word. Let’s go with CLOWN.

- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- W(x) → W is NOT in the word.
- N(x) → N is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- Must have L in position 4 (from DRILL).
- Must contain O somewhere, but NOT in position 3.
- Cannot contain S, A, T, E, D, R, I, C, W, N.

Remaining consonants: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.
Remaining vowels: O (already confirmed), U (since A, E, I are out).

Pattern so far: _ _ _ L _

O must appear in position 1, 2, or 5.

Let’s list possible words:
- If O is in position 1: O _ _ L _
  Possible: O B _ L _ → O B L L _ → but L is already in position 4, so O B L L _ → needs 5th letter. O B L L _ → O B L L Y (OBLLY – not a word). O B L L _ → O B L L _ → no common word.
  O M _ L _ → O M B L _ → OMBLY – no.
  O M P L _ → OMPLE – no.
  O M P L Y – OMPLY – no.
  O M P L _ → no.

- If O is in position 2: _ O _ L _
  Possible: B O _ L _ → B O M L Y → BO MLY – no.
  F O _ L _ → F O G L Y → FOGLY – no.
  G O _ L _ → G O M L Y → GOMLY – no.
  H O _ L _ → H O M L Y → HOMLY – no.
  M O _ L _ → M O B L Y → MOBLY – no.
  P O _ L _ → P O M L Y → POMLY – no.
  V O _ L _ → V O M L Y → VOMLY – no.

- If O is in position 5: _ _ _ L O
  Possible: B _ _ L O → B U M L O →BUMLO – no.
  F _ _ L O → F U M L O →FUMLO – no.
  G _ _ L O → G U M L O →GUMLO – no.
  H _ _ L O → H U M L O →HUMLO – no.
  M _ _ L O → M U B L O →MUBLO – no.
  P _ _ L O → P U B L O → PUBLO – no.
  V _ _ L O → V U M L O →VUMLO – no.
  B _ _ L O → B U M L O – none are valid.

Let me rethink: perhaps O is in position 1, 2, or 5, but I need common words.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words with pattern _ _ _ L O, using allowed letters.

Allowed letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z, O, U.

Common words ending in LO:
- BLOWY – contains W (invalid).
- CLOWN – already used.
- FLOCK – contains C (invalid).
- GLOOM – contains C (invalid).
- HULLO – contains H, U, L, L, O – but L is in position 4, so H U L L O → positions: H(1), U(2), L(3), L(4), O(5). But we know L must be in position 4, so this would require L in position 3 and 4, which is impossible. So HULLO is invalid.
- JOLLY – contains J, O, L, L, Y. Pattern: J(1), O(2), L(3), L(4), Y(5). Here L is in position 4 (✓), O is in position 2 (allowed, since O must be somewhere but not in position 3). Letters: J, O, L, Y are allowed. This seems valid.

Check JOLLY:
- J: allowed (not in excluded list).
- O: allowed, in position 2 (not 3).
- L: in position 4 (✓).
- L: in position 3 – but we already know L is in position 4, so this is fine (two L’s possible).
- Y: allowed.

But JOLLY has two L’s: positions 3 and 4. Is this possible? The secret word could have two L’s, one in position 4 and another elsewhere. The feedback didn’t forbid duplicates.

Another candidate: MOLLY – same issue, M, O, L, L, Y. L in position 4, O in position 2. Also valid.

Between JOLLY and MOLLY, JOLLY is more common.

Let’s try JOLLY.Based on the feedback, the word must have:
- L in position 4.
- O somewhere, but not in position 3.
- Excluded letters: S, A, T, E, D, R, I, C, W, N.

A valid word fitting these constraints is JOLLY.

From the feedback on JOLLY:

- J(x) → J is NOT in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in position 2.
- L(✓) → L is in the word and in position 3.
- L(✓) → L is in the word and in position 4.
- Y(✓) → Y is in the word and in position 5.

So the secret word has the pattern: _ O L L Y.

Now we just need to determine the first letter. The remaining letters that have not been excluded yet are: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Z, U.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ O L L Y:

- B O L L Y → BOLLY (valid word)
- F O L L Y → FOLLY (valid word)
- G O L L Y → GOLLY (valid word)
- H O L L Y → HOLL Y (HOLLY is valid)
- M O L L Y → MOLLY (valid word)
- P O L L Y → POLLY (valid word)

Among these, the most common and likely answer is HOLL Y (HOLLY). Let's check HOLLY:

H, O, L, L, Y – all letters fit the constraints:
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- L is in positions 3 and 4 (✓)
- Y is in position 5 (✓)
- H is a new letter that hasn't been excluded.
