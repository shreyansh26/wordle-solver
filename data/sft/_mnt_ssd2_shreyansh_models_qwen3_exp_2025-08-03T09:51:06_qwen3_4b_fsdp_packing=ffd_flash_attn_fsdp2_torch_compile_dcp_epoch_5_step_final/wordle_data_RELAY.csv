### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should ideally include several of these letters without repeating any, to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

One such optimal starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This gives us a high chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, providing valuable feedback for our next guess.

One such word is ""TRAIN"":
- Contains T, R, A, I, N

Another word: ""REACT""

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
Guess 2: REACT → R(✓) E(✓) A(-) C(x) T(x)

What we now know:
1. The word contains R and E, and they are in the correct positions: R is 1st, E is 2nd.
2. The word contains A but A is NOT in position 3 (from REACT feedback).
3. Letters NOT in the word: O, S, C, T.
4. We still need to place A somewhere (not position 1, 2, or 3).
5. We need two more letters that haven’t been ruled out yet.

Common unused letters: D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with RE, includes A somewhere (positions 4 or 5), and uses two new letters. Let’s try:

- REPAIR: uses P and I, but A is in position 3 (invalid).
- READY: uses D and Y, A is in position 3 (invalid).
- REBEL: uses B and L, A is missing (invalid).
- REBAN: uses B and N, A is in position 3 (invalid).
- REBAS: uses B and S, but S is invalid.
- REBID: uses B and D, A is missing (invalid).
- REBIA: uses B and I, A is in position 5 (valid), but REBIA is not a standard word.
- REBAN: already considered.
- REBID: already considered.
- REBID: no A.
- REBAS: S is invalid.
- REBEL: no A.
- REBIA: not valid.
- REBID: no A.
- REBAN: A in 3rd invalid.

Let’s try A in position 4: RE_ _A
- REBAN: A in 3rd invalid.
- REDIA: uses D and I, A in 4th (valid), but REDIA is not standard.
- REFIN: uses F and N, A is missing.
- REGAN: uses G and N, A in 5th (valid), but REGAN is a proper noun (name).
- REIGN: uses G and N, A is missing.
- RELAX: uses L and X, A is in 4th (valid), but X is less common.
- REMAX: uses M and X, A in 4th (valid), but REMAX is a name.
- REPAY: uses P and Y, A in 4th (valid), REPAY is valid.

REPAY:
- R(✓) E(✓) P _ A _  (positions 1,2,4)
- Letters: R, E, P, A, Y
- No O, S, C, T
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- Uses two new letters P and Y

This seems like a good third guess.

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should ideally include several of these letters without repeating any, to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.\n\nOne such optimal starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates.

From the new feedback on REPAY:
- R(✓) 1st letter correct
- E(✓) 2nd letter correct
- P(x) P is NOT in the word
- A(✓) 4th letter correct
- Y(✓) 5th letter correct

So the secret word is of the form:
R E _ A Y

We need to find the 3rd letter. Letters already ruled out: O, S, C, T, P.  
Letters still allowed: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a common letter that fits. Common possibilities:
- REBAY? Not a word.
- REDAY? Not standard.
- REFAY? Not standard.
- REGAY? Not standard.
- REHAY? Not standard.
- REIAY? Not standard.
- RELAY? Yes, RELAY is a valid word.

Check RELAY:
- R E L A Y
- Letters: R, E, L, A, Y
- No ruled-out letters (P, O, S, C, T are absent)
- Matches the pattern R E _ A Y

Therefore, RELAY is the correct guess.
