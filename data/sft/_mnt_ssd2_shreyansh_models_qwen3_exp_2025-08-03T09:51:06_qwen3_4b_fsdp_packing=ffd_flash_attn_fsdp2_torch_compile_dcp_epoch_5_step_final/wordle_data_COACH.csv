For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover a mix of these to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters.

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (covers A, R, I, S, E)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on ARISE:
- A is in the word but not in the first position.
- R, I, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, I, S, E.
- Does contain A, but not in position 1.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A somewhere (positions 2-5).
2. Avoids R, I, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information (T, N, L, C, D, O, U, etc.).

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Vowels left: O, U (since A is confirmed, and I, E are ruled out).

Let’s pick a word that uses A plus common consonants and vowels. A good candidate is ""CLOAK"":
- C, L, O, A, K
- A is in position 4 (not position 1, satisfying the feedback).
- Avoids R, I, S, E.
- Uses O and K which are new letters to test.

Another good option could be ""PLANK"" or ""GLOAM"", but ""CLOAK"" seems balanced.

- C _ O _ _ : O in position 3 is ruled out.

""CANON"":

- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- P, O, N are new letters.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover a mix of these to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters.

Popular starting words include:

- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (covers A, R, I, S, E)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

1. Has A somewhere (positions 2-5).
2. Avoids R, I, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information (T, N, L, C, D, O, U, etc.).

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Vowels left: O, U (since A is confirmed, and I, E are ruled out).

Let’s pick a word that uses A plus common consonants and vowels. A good candidate is ""CLOAK"":
- C, L, O, A, K
- A is in position 4 (not position 1, satisfying the feedback).
- Avoids R, I, S, E.
- Uses O and K which are new letters to test.

From the new feedback on CLOAK:
- C is in the word and in the correct first position (✓).
- L, K are not in the word (x).
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4 (-).

So far we know:
1. Word starts with C.
2. Contains A, O, but not in positions 1, 3, 4 respectively.
3. Does NOT contain R, I, S, E, L, K.

Remaining letters to consider: B, D, F, G, H, J, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus A and O.

A, O must appear somewhere else in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (but not where the feedback ruled them out). Since A cannot be in positions 1 or 4, possible positions for A: 2, 3, 5.
O cannot be in position 3, so possible positions for O: 2, 4, 5.

We need a 5-letter word starting with C that uses A and O in allowed positions and avoids the eliminated letters.

Possible structure: C _ _ _ _

Let’s brainstorm words:
- C A _ _ _ : A in position 2 is allowed.
- C _ A _ _ : A in position 3 is allowed (since A was only ruled out of 1 and 4).
- C _ _ A _ : A in position 4 is ruled out.
- C _ _ _ A : A in position 5 is allowed.

Similarly for O:
- C O _ _ _ : O in position 2 is allowed.
- C _ O _ _ : O in position 3 is ruled out.
- C _ _ O _ : O in position 4 is allowed.
- C _ _ _ O : O in position 5 is allowed.

Combining these, we need words that fit one of these patterns and use remaining letters.

Let’s try ""COBRA"":

""COYPU"":

""CANON"":
- Starts with C, has A in position 2 and O in position 4. Letters: C, A, N, O, N. R is not used, but we need to check if R is allowed. R was ruled out in ARISE. So invalid.

""CAPON"":
- Starts with C, has A in position 2 and O in position 4. Letters: C, A, P, O, N. R is not used, and R was ruled out. This seems valid.

But let me verify:
- C is correct in position 1.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- P, O, N are new letters.
- R is not in the word (ruled out), so CAPON is okay.

Another option: ""CANTO"":

Between CAPON and CANTO, CANTO uses more common letters (N, T) and avoids P which is less common. Let’s go with CANTO.

But wait, let me double-check:
- CANTO: C(1), A(2), N(3), T(4), O(5).
- A is in position 2 (allowed, not 1 or 4).

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover a mix of these to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters.

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (covers A, R, I, S, E)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for the first guess.

- CAVUP (invalid)
- CAVUY (invalid)

Looking at Case 1: C O A _ _
- COAV_ - no common words
- COA is prefix, but need 5 letters: COALS (invalid - L), COALS ruled out
- COAPT (invalid - T ruled out)
- COA is prefix, but COAPT not a word

Case 2: C O _ _ A
- COBBA (invalid - B twice, but COBBA is a word? Maybe, but let's think of more common ones)
- COBRA (invalid - R)
- COFFA (invalid - F twice)
- COGGA (invalid)
- COHMA (invalid)
- COIPA (invalid)
- COJJA (invalid)
- COMMA (valid word - M twice allowed)
- COPPA (invalid - P twice)
- COVVA (invalid)
- COXMA (invalid)

COMMA:
- C(1) ✓
- O(2) allowed (not 3 or 5)
- M(3) allowed
- M(4) allowed
- A(5) allowed (positions 1,2,4 ruled out for A, so 5 is okay)
- Letters: C, O, M, M, A - all allowed
- This seems valid.

Another candidate: COBMA (invalid - not a word)
COGMA (invalid)
COXMA (invalid)

COMMA is the best fit here.

Let me verify:
- C is correct in position 1.
- O in position 2 (allowed)
- A in position 5 (allowed)
- M in positions 3 and 4 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters.

Thus, COMMA is a valid next guess.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover a mix of these to quickly eliminate or confirm many letters.

Popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ARISE (covers A, R, I, S, E)
- AUDIO (covers A, U, D, I, O)

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A is in the word but not in the first position.
- R, I, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain R, I, S, E.
- Does contain A, but not in position 1.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A somewhere (positions 2-5).
2. Avoids R, I, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information (T, N, L, C, D, O, U, etc.).

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Vowels left: O, U (since A is confirmed, and I, E are ruled out).

Let’s pick a word that uses A plus common consonants and vowels. A good candidate is ""CLOAK"":
- C, L, O, A, K
- A is in position 4 (not position 1, satisfying the feedback).
- Avoids R, I, S, E.
- Uses O and K which are new letters to test.

Another good option could be ""PLANK"" or ""GLOAM"", but ""CLOAK"" seems balanced.

Guess 2: CLOAK -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(x) O(-) A(-) K(x)
<|im_end|>

From the new feedback on CLOAK:
- C is in the word and in the correct first position (✓).
- L, K are not in the word (x).
- O is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4 (-).

So far we know:
1. Word starts with C.
2. Contains A, O, but not in positions 1, 3, 4 respectively.
3. Does NOT contain R, I, S, E, L, K.

Remaining letters to consider: B, D, F, G, H, J, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus A and O.

A, O must appear somewhere else in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (but not where the feedback ruled them out). Since A cannot be in positions 1 or 4, possible positions for A: 2, 3, 5.
O cannot be in position 3, so possible positions for O: 2, 4, 5.

We need a 5-letter word starting with C that uses A and O in allowed positions and avoids the eliminated letters.

Possible structure: C _ _ _ _

Let’s brainstorm words:
- C A _ _ _ : A in position 2 is allowed.
- C _ A _ _ : A in position 3 is allowed (since A was only ruled out of 1 and 4).
- C _ _ A _ : A in position 4 is ruled out.
- C _ _ _ A : A in position 5 is allowed.

Similarly for O:
- C O _ _ _ : O in position 2 is allowed.
- C _ O _ _ : O in position 3 is ruled out.
- C _ _ O _ : O in position 4 is allowed.
- C _ _ _ O : O in position 5 is allowed.

Combining these, we need words that fit one of these patterns and use remaining letters.

Let’s try ""COBRA"":
- Starts with C.
- Contains O and A (but A is not in COBRA). So invalid.

""COYPU"":
- Starts with C, has O and U, but no A. Invalid.

""CAVOR"":
- Starts with C, has A in position 2 and O in position 4. This seems valid:
  - C A V O R
  - Letters used: C, A, V, O, R. But R is already ruled out (from ARISE). So invalid.

""CANON"":
- Starts with C, has A in position 2 and O in position 4. Letters: C, A, N, O, N. R is not used, but we need to check if R is allowed. R was ruled out in ARISE. So invalid.

""CAPON"":
- Starts with C, has A in position 2 and O in position 4. Letters: C, A, P, O, N. R is not used, and R was ruled out. This seems valid.

But let me verify:
- C is correct in position 1.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- P, O, N are new letters.
- R is not in the word (ruled out), so CAPON is okay.

Another option: ""CANTO"":
- Starts with C, has A in position 2 and O in position 5. Letters: C, A, N, T, O. R is not used, and R was ruled out. This seems valid.

Between CAPON and CANTO, CANTO uses more common letters (N, T) and avoids P which is less common. Let’s go with CANTO.

But wait, let me double-check:
- CANTO: C(1), A(2), N(3), T(4), O(5).
- A is in position 2 (allowed, not 1 or 4).
- O is in position 5 (allowed, not 3).
- C is correct in position 1.
- N and T are new letters to test.

This seems like a good next guess.

- Letters: C, O, M, M, A - all allowed
- This seems valid.

Another candidate: COBMA (invalid - not a word)
COGMA (invalid)
COXMA (invalid)

COMMA is the best fit here.

Let me verify:
- C is correct in position 1.
- O in position 2 (allowed)
- A in position 5 (allowed)
- M in positions 3 and 4 (allowed)
- No forbidden letters.

Thus, COMMA is a valid next guess.

From all feedback so far:

1. C is fixed in position 1 (✓).
2. O is now fixed in position 2 (✓).
3. A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (from ARISE, CANTO, COMMA).  
   Therefore, A must be in position 3.
4. Forbidden letters: R, I, S, E, L, K, N, T, M.

So the word looks like: C O A _ _

We need two more letters (positions 4 and 5) from the still-allowed set:  
B, D, F, G, H, J, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit C O A _ _ :

- COALS – invalid (L)
- COAPT – invalid (T)
- COBRA – invalid (R, B)
- COFFA – invalid (F twice)
- COGGA – invalid (G twice)
- COHMA – invalid (H, M)
- COIPA – invalid (I, P)
- COJJA – invalid (J twice)
- COMMA – already guessed
- COPPA – invalid (P twice)
- COVVA – invalid (V twice)
- COXMA – invalid (X, M)

The only remaining common word that fits is COBRA, but R is forbidden.  
Next, check COBWA (invalid), COBBA (invalid), COBFA (invalid), etc.

Looking at the allowed letters, a valid word is COBWA (not common).  
Another possibility is COBBA, but B twice is allowed and COBBA is a word (British spelling of ""cob"" + ""ba"").

But COBBA is obscure.  
A more common word is COBWA (not standard).  
Another candidate: COGGA (not standard).

Upon reflection, the only standard word fitting is COBBA.  
But let me verify:

COBBA:
- C(1) ✓
- O(2) ✓
- A(3) ✓
- B(4) allowed
- B(5) allowed

COBBA is a valid English word (British informal for ""cob"").

However, to maximize information, perhaps COBZA (invalid), COGGA (invalid), etc. are not words.

Another candidate: COBZA – invalid.

Looking again, COBWA is not standard.  
The best valid word seems COBBA.

But wait, is COBBA valid? Yes, it's in some dictionaries as a variant of ""cob"" (short for ""cobweb"" or similar).

Thus, COBBA is the best next guess.
