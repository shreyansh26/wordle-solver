### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. 

One of the most common 5-letter words in English is ""AROSE"" because it contains several very common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

- Letters **confirmed** in the word: O (position 2), D (somewhere other than position 5)

Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus D and O.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2
- D somewhere except position 5
- No other letters from the forbidden list above

Let’s list possible words:
- _ O _ _ _ with D in 1, 3, or 4

Possible candidates:
- D O G S T (but S is forbidden)  
- B O D Y _ (B, O, D, Y are allowed)  
- H O D G E (E is forbidden)  
- M O D E L (E, L forbidden)  
- F O G D Y (F, G, D, Y allowed)

“BODY_” seems promising: B, O, D, Y are all allowed.  
We need a 5-letter word starting with B, O, D, Y.  
A valid word is “BODY_” but we need 5 letters.  
Actually, “BOY” is too short.  
Wait, let’s think of valid words:

- B O D Y _ → “BODY_” is not a word.  
- D O B Y _ → “DOB” is too short.  
- H O D G _ → “HOG” is too short.  
- M O D _ _ → “MOD” is too short.  
- F O G D _ → “FOGGY” has G twice, but F, O, G, D, Y are allowed.  
- “FOGGY” uses F, O, G, G, Y – but G is allowed twice?  
  Actually, we don’t know if G is allowed, but G is not in the forbidden list.  
  However, “FOGGY” has two G’s, which might not help us much.

Another approach: we know O is in position 2 and D is somewhere else.  
Let’s try “DOUGH”:
- D, O, U, G, H  
  – U is forbidden (from could feedback).  

“DOGMA”:
- D, O, G, M, A  
  – A is forbidden.  

“DOGM” is too short.  

“DOUGH” is invalid due to U.  

“DOZEN”:
- D, O, Z, E, N  
  – E and N are forbidden.  

“DOWDY”:
- D, O, W, D, Y  
  – W and Y are allowed, D is allowed twice.  
  – Positions: D O W D Y  
  – D is in position 1 and 4; O is in position 2.  
  – This seems valid.

But we need to maximize new information.  
Let’s try “DOWDY” – it uses D, O, W, Y.  
But W and Y are new letters.  

Alternatively, “DOGMY” is invalid.  

Another candidate: “FOGGY” – but F, O, G, G, Y.  
G is allowed, but we don’t know if it’s in the word.  

Wait, let’s think systematically.  
We need a word with:
- O in position 2  
- D somewhere except position 5  
- No A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, L  

Possible letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, D, O

Let’s list possible words:
- _ O _ _ _ with D in 1, 3, or 4

Possible words:
- B O D Y _ → “BODY_” is not a word.  
- B O D Y is 4 letters.  
- H O D G _ → “HOG” is too short.  
- M O D _ _ → “MOD” is too short.  
- F O G D _ → “FOGGY” uses F, O, G, G, Y – but G is allowed.  
- “FOGGY” is a valid 5-letter word.  
- “FOGGY” gives feedback on F, G, G, Y.  

But we might prefer a word that introduces more new letters.  
Another option: “DOGMY” – invalid.  

Wait, let’s try “DOZED”:
- D, O, Z, E, D  
  – E is forbidden.  

“DOZEN”:
- D, O, Z, E, N  
  – E and N are forbidden.  

“DOZ” is too short.  

“DOG” is too short.  

“DOW” is too short.  

“DO” is too short.  

Hmm, maybe “DOZ” is too short.  

Let’s try “FOGGY” despite the double G – it’s a valid word and uses F, G, Y.  

But another candidate: “BODGY”:
- B, O, D, G, Y  
  – B, O, D, G, Y are all allowed.  
  – O is in position 2.  
  – D is in position 3 (not 5).  
  – This seems perfect: tests B, G, Y while keeping O in position 2 and D in position 3.

“BODGY” is a valid 5-letter word.  
Let’s choose this as the next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. 

One of the most common 5-letter words in English is ""AROSE"" because it contains several very common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains O, but O cannot be in position 3.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

I now want a 5-letter word that:
1. Has an O somewhere other than position 3.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining common letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

A word that fits these constraints is “POINT”:
- Contains O (and it’s in position 2, so we test if O is in position 2).
- Uses P, I, N, T – none of which are A, R, S, or E.

So far we know:

Letters left to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with O in position 2 and no forbidden letters.  
A good candidate is “COULD”:
- C, U, L, D are all allowed so far.
- O is in position 2 as required.
- It introduces new common letters (C, U, L, D) to test.

Let’s check:
- C: allowed
- O: position 2 ✓
- U: allowed
- L: allowed
- D: allowed

This seems like a strong next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. 

One of the most common 5-letter words in English is ""AROSE"" because it contains several very common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains O, but O cannot be in position 3.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

I now want a 5-letter word that:
1. Has an O somewhere other than position 3.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining common letters: T, N, I, L, C, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

A word that fits these constraints is “POINT”:
- Contains O (and it’s in position 2, so we test if O is in position 2).
- Uses P, I, N, T – none of which are A, R, S, or E.

So far we know:

Letters left to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with O in position 2 and no forbidden letters.  
A good candidate is “COULD”:
- C, U, L, D are all allowed so far.
- O is in position 2 as required.
- It introduces new common letters (C, U, L, D) to test.

Let’s check:
- C: allowed
- O: position 2 ✓
- U: allowed
- L: allowed
- D: allowed

From the feedback so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)  
   – O is in the word but **not** in position 3.

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   – O is in position 2 (✓).  
   – P, I, N, T are **not** in the word.

3. could → C(x) O(✓) U(x) L(x) D(-)  
   – O is still in position 2 (✓).  
   – C, U, L are **not** in the word.  
   – D **is** in the word but **not** in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters **not** in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, L  
- Letters **confirmed** in the word: O (position 2), D (somewhere other than position 5)

Remaining possible letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus D and O.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2
- D somewhere except position 5
- No other letters from the forbidden list above

Let’s list possible words:
- _ O _ _ _ with D in 1, 3, or 4

Possible candidates:
- D O G S T (but S is forbidden)  
- B O D Y _ (B, O, D, Y are allowed)  
- H O D G E (E is forbidden)  
- M O D E L (E, L forbidden)  
- F O G D Y (F, G, D, Y allowed)

“BODY_” seems promising: B, O, D, Y are all allowed.  
We need a 5-letter word starting with B, O, D, Y.  
A valid word is “BODY_” but we need 5 letters.  
Actually, “BOY” is too short.  
Wait, let’s think of valid words:

- B O D Y _ → “BODY_” is not a word.  
- D O B Y _ → “DOB” is too short.  
- H O D G _ → “HOG” is too short.  
- M O D _ _ → “MOD” is too short.  
- F O G D _ → “FOGGY” has G twice, but F, O, G, D, Y are allowed.  
- “FOGGY” uses F, O, G, G, Y – but G is allowed twice?  
  Actually, we don’t know if G is allowed, but G is not in the forbidden list.  
  However, “FOGGY” has two G’s, which might not help us much.

Another approach: we know O is in position 2 and D is somewhere else.  
Let’s try “DOUGH”:
- D, O, U, G, H  
  – U is forbidden (from could feedback).  

“DOGMA”:
- D, O, G, M, A  
  – A is forbidden.  

“DOGM” is too short.  

“DOUGH” is invalid due to U.  

“DOZEN”:
- D, O, Z, E, N  
  – E and N are forbidden.  

“DOWDY”:
- D, O, W, D, Y  
  – W and Y are allowed, D is allowed twice.  
  – Positions: D O W D Y  
  – D is in position 1 and 4; O is in position 2.  
  – This seems valid.

But we need to maximize new information.  
Let’s try “DOWDY” – it uses D, O, W, Y.  
But W and Y are new letters.  

Alternatively, “DOGMY” is invalid.  

Another candidate: “FOGGY” – but F, O, G, G, Y.  
G is allowed, but we don’t know if it’s in the word.  

Wait, let’s think systematically.  
We need a word with:
- O in position 2  
- D somewhere except position 5  
- No A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, L  

Possible letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, D, O

Let’s list possible words:
- _ O _ _ _ with D in 1, 3, or 4

Possible words:
- B O D Y _ → “BODY_” is not a word.  
- B O D Y is 4 letters.  
- H O D G _ → “HOG” is too short.  
- M O D _ _ → “MOD” is too short.  
- F O G D _ → “FOGGY” uses F, O, G, G, Y – but G is allowed.  
- “FOGGY” is a valid 5-letter word.  
- “FOGGY” gives feedback on F, G, G, Y.  

But we might prefer a word that introduces more new letters.  
Another option: “DOGMY” – invalid.  

Wait, let’s try “DOZED”:
- D, O, Z, E, D  
  – E is forbidden.  

“DOZEN”:
- D, O, Z, E, N  
  – E and N are forbidden.  

“DOZ” is too short.  

“DOG” is too short.  

“DOW” is too short.  

“DO” is too short.  

Hmm, maybe “DOZ” is too short.  

Let’s try “FOGGY” despite the double G – it’s a valid word and uses F, G, Y.  

But another candidate: “BODGY”:
- B, O, D, G, Y  
  – B, O, D, G, Y are all allowed.  
  – O is in position 2.  
  – D is in position 3 (not 5).  
  – This seems perfect: tests B, G, Y while keeping O in position 2 and D in position 3.

“BODGY” is a valid 5-letter word.

From the feedback on “dowdy”:

- D(-) – D is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
- O(✓) – O is in position 2 (confirmed).  
- W(✓) – W is in the word and in position 3.  
- D(✓) – D is in the word and in position 4.  
- Y(✓) – Y is in the word and in position 5.  

So the word must be: _ O W D Y  
The only missing letter is position 1.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): F, H, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Z (since A, R, S, E, P, I, N, T, C, U, L, B, G are out).

Looking at common 5-letter words ending in “OWDY”:
- FOWDY – but F is allowed.  
- HOWDY – H is allowed.  
- JOWDY – J is allowed.  
- KOWDY – K is allowed.  
- MOWDY – M is allowed.  
- VOWDY – V is allowed.  
- XOWDY – X is allowed.  
- ZOWDY – Z is allowed.  

The most common word among these is “HOWDY”.  
Let’s verify: H, O, W, D, Y – all allowed and positions match the clues.

Therefore, the next guess is “HOWDY”.
