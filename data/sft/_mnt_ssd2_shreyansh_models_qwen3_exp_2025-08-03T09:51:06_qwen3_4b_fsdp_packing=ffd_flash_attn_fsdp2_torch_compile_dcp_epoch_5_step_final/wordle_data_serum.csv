### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, providing valuable information for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-), so it must appear somewhere in positions 2-5, but not at the end (since it was last in SLATE)
- L, A, T are not in the word at all (x)

So the pattern so far is:
S _ _ _ _  (S fixed in position 1)
and the word contains E somewhere in positions 2-4 (since it cannot be in position 5).

I need a new 5-letter word that starts with S, contains E in positions 2-4, and avoids L, A, T.

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, H, M, P, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, O, U (since A is out, E is already in)

Let me think of words that fit S _ _ E _ or S _ E _ _ or S E _ _ _.

Possible candidates:
- SHIRE (S H I R E) – but has R which might be useful, but I need to check if it fits constraints
- SCREE (but that's 5 letters, S C R E E – but has E in position 5 which was marked as wrong position, so E can't be last)
- SIREN (S I R E N) – E is in position 4, which is allowed, and avoids L, A, T
- SNARE (S N A R E) – but A is out
- SPREE (S P R E E) – E can't be last
- SKEIN (but K is less common)
- SNEER (S N E E R) – has E twice, but positions are 3 and 4 – E can be in 3 or 4
- SMITE – but T is out
- SPEER – but P is okay, E in 4 is okay
- SHERD – D is okay, but E is out
- SHORE – E is in 4, which is okay, avoids L, A, T

""SHORE"" seems like a strong next guess:
- Starts with S (correct position)
- Has E in position 4 (allowed)
- Avoids L, A, T
- Uses common letters H, O, R which are good to test

Another good option is ""SIREN"":
- S I R E N – E in position 4
- Tests I, R, N which are common letters

Between these, ""SHORE"" uses H, O, R which are very common and might give more information. I'll go with that.
