For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several letters at once. A good strategy is to use vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels are present and their positions, as well as whether R or S are in the word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the first position.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in the third position.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the fourth position.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, E
- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): A, O, S

We need a 5-letter word that contains A, O, and S, and does not contain R or E. Also, A cannot be in position 1, O cannot be in position 3, and S cannot be in position 4.

Possible candidates: 
- ""SOFA"" is 4 letters, too short.
- ""SAO"" is 3 letters, too short.
- ""SALOA"" – but contains E (no), and is invalid.
- ""SALSA"" – contains R? No, but has S twice, A twice, but we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, SALSA has S in position 1 and 4, but S cannot be in 4, so S in 1 is okay, but need to check other positions.

Wait, let's think systematically. We need a 5-letter word with A, O, S, no R or E, and positions as per constraints.

Possible words:
- ""ASIAN"" – has A, S, I, A, N. Contains no R or E, but we don't know about I or N yet. But we have no info on I or N, so this might be a good candidate.
- ""SALSA"" – has S, A, L, S, A. Contains no R or E, but has S in position 4 (which is invalid because S cannot be in position 4). So SALSA is invalid.
- ""SAVIO"" – contains V, I, O. But has no R or E, and positions: S(1), A(2), V(3), I(4), O(5). A is in 2 (allowed), O is in 5 (allowed), S is in 1 (allowed). This seems valid.
- ""SALVO"" – has S, A, L, V, O. Contains no R or E, positions: S(1), A(2), L(3), V(4), O(5). A in 2 (allowed), O in 5 (allowed), S in 1 (allowed). This seems valid.
- ""SANDO"" – has S, A, N, D, O. Contains no R or E, positions: S(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), O(5). A in 2 (allowed), O in 5 (allowed), S in 1 (allowed). This seems valid.

Between these, ""SALVO"" or ""SANDO"" seem good. ""SALVO"" has V which is a new letter, ""SANDO"" has N and D. ""SALVO"" seems slightly better as V is a common letter in this context.

But let's check ""ASIAN"" – A(1) is invalid because A cannot be in position 1. So ASIAN is invalid.

""SALVO"" is valid: positions S(1), A(2), L(3), V(4), O(5). A is in position 2 (allowed), O is in 5 (allowed), S is in 1 (allowed), no R or E.

Another candidate: ""SALSA"" is invalid because S is in 4. ""SALVO"" seems the best.

Alternatively, ""SOFA"" is 4 letters, so no.

Another option: ""SALTY"" – but has T and Y, no O. Not helpful.

""SANDO"" seems valid. Between SALVO and SANDO, SALVO introduces V which is new, but SANDO introduces N and D. Both are fine.

I'll go with ""SALVO"" as it introduces a new letter (V) while meeting all constraints.

Based on the feedback from AROSE, we know:
- R and E are not in the word at all.
- A, O, and S are in the word but not in their original positions (A not first, O not third, S not fourth).

A good next guess should contain A, O, S and avoid R, E while testing new letters. ""SALVO"" includes S, A, O and introduces V, L which could help narrow positions.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)

   - Letters in the word but not yet fixed: A, O, S

   - A is confirmed in position 2
   - L is not in the word
   - V is in the word but not in position 4
   - O is in the word but not in position 5

So far we know:
- The word starts with S A _ _ _
- It contains O and V somewhere in positions 3-5 (since O cannot be 5th and V cannot be 4th)
- It does not contain R, E, or L

Possible positions for O and V:
- O could be 3rd or 4th
- V could be 3rd, 4th, or 5th (but not 4th because O can't be 5th and V can't be 4th)

Let's list valid combinations:
- S A O V _ → but then V would be 4th which is invalid (V can't be 4th)
- S A O _ V → O is 3rd (valid), V is 5th (valid)
- S A V O _ → V is 3rd (valid), O is 4th (valid)
- S A V _ O → O is 5th (invalid)
- S A _ O V → V is 5th (valid)
- S A _ V O → O is 5th (invalid)

Valid patterns:
1. S A O _ V
2. S A V O _
3. S A _ O V

We need a 5-letter word that fits these patterns and uses only allowed letters (no R, E, L).

Looking at pattern 2: S A V O _ → ""SAVO_"" – possible word: ""SAVON"" (but N is allowed), but ""SAVON"" isn't common.
Pattern 3: S A _ O V → ""SA_OV"" – possible: ""SALOV"" (but L is excluded), ""SAPON"" (but P is allowed), but ""SAPON"" isn't a word.
Pattern 1: S A O _ V → ""SAO_V"" – possible: ""SAOIV"" (invalid), ""SAOVY"" (invalid), but ""SAOIV"" isn't a word.

Wait, let's think of real words:
- ""SAVOY"" – but Y is allowed, and SAVOY is a valid word. It fits S A V O Y, but we need O and V in positions 3-4. SAVOY has V in 3rd and O in 4th, which fits pattern 2 (S A V O _).

But we need to check if SAVOY is valid. Yes, SAVOY is a 5-letter word (a place).

Another option: ""SAVOR"" – but R is excluded.
""SAVOY"" seems the best fit.

But let's verify:
SAVOY:
- S(1) ✓
- A(2) ✓
- V(3) – V is in word but not in 4th (here it's 3rd, so ok)
- O(4) – O is in word but not in 5th (here it's 4th, so ok)
- Y(5) – new letter, allowed

This seems correct.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- S is confirmed in position 1
- A is confirmed in position 2
- V is in the word but not in position 4
- O is in the word but not in position 5
- Letters to exclude: R, E, L

The most logical next guess fitting these constraints is ""SAVOY"".

<guess>SAVOY</guess>",SAVOY,"From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: R, E
   - Letters in the word but not yet fixed: A, O, S

2. SALVO → S(✓) A(✓) L(x) V(-) O(-)
   - S is now confirmed in position 1
   - A is confirmed in position 2
   - L is not in the word
   - V is in the word but not in position 4
   - O is in the word but not in position 5

So far we know:
- The word starts with S A _ _ _
- It contains O and V somewhere in positions 3-5 (since O cannot be 5th and V cannot be 4th)
- It does not contain R, E, or L

Possible positions for O and V:
- O could be 3rd or 4th
- V could be 3rd, 4th, or 5th (but not 4th because O can't be 5th and V can't be 4th)

Let's list valid combinations:
- S A O V _ → but then V would be 4th which is invalid (V can't be 4th)
- S A O _ V → O is 3rd (valid), V is 5th (valid)
- S A V O _ → V is 3rd (valid), O is 4th (valid)
- S A V _ O → O is 5th (invalid)
- S A _ O V → V is 5th (valid)
- S A _ V O → O is 5th (invalid)

Valid patterns:
1. S A O _ V
2. S A V O _
3. S A _ O V
