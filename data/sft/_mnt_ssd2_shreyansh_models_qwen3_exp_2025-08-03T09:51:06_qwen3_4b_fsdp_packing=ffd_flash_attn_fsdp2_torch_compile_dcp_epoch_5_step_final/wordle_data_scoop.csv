### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback to work with, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word often includes vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give good coverage to narrow down the secret word efficiently.

From the feedback:
- S is in the word and in the correct first position (✓ at position 1).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word starts with S and does not contain L, A, T, E.  
We need a 5-letter word starting with S, avoiding L, A, T, E, and still covering other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, P, M, D, G, B, F, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A strong second guess that uses common remaining letters is “SHIRK”:
- S (already fixed at position 1)  
- H, I, R, K are all common letters not yet ruled out.

This will test the presence of H, I, R, K in the remaining four positions, giving us more clues.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior feedback to work with, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word often includes vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common ending letter)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give good coverage to narrow down the secret word efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- S is in the word and in the correct first position (✓ at position 1).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x).

So the secret word starts with S and does not contain L, A, T, E.  
We need a 5-letter word starting with S, avoiding L, A, T, E, and still covering other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, P, M, D, G, B, F, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A strong second guess that uses common remaining letters is “SHIRK”:
- S (already fixed at position 1)  
- H, I, R, K are all common letters not yet ruled out.

This will test the presence of H, I, R, K in the remaining four positions, giving us more clues.

We now know:
- First letter is S (fixed).
- Letters NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, H, I, R, K.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, M, N, O, P, U, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, using none of the eliminated letters, and preferably including common remaining consonants and vowels (especially O, U, N, M, P, etc.).

A good candidate is ""SONIC"":
- Starts with S.
- Uses O, N, I, C (but I is already eliminated, so this is bad).

Next try ""SMUGG"":
- Starts with S.
- Uses M, U, G, G.
- Eliminated letters avoided.
- However, ""SMUGG"" is not a valid word.

Next try ""SNOOK"":
- Starts with S.
- Uses S, N, O, O, K.
- K is eliminated.

Next try ""SNUGG"":
- Not a valid word.

Next try ""SWUNG"":
- Starts with S.
- Uses W, U, N, G.
- All letters are allowed so far.

But ""SWUNG"" is valid.

Another candidate is ""SPOOF"":
- Starts with S.
- Uses P, O, O, F.
- All letters allowed.

Between ""SWUNG"" and ""SPOOF"", ""SPOOF"" is more common.

Let's go with ""SPOOF"".
