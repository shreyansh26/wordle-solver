### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should include several of these.

Some popular first guesses are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers five very common letters and has a good mix of vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓)
- A is in the correct third position (✓)
- T is in the word but not in the fourth position (-)
- L and E are not in the word at all (x)

So far we know:
- Word pattern: S _ A _ _
- Contains T somewhere after the third position (positions 2, 4, or 5)
- Does NOT contain L or E

Looking at common 5-letter words starting with S, having A in the third position, and containing T somewhere after the A:
Possible patterns: S T A _ _ or S _ A T _ or S _ A _ T

Let me brainstorm:
- SATIN (has I, N - but no T after A)
- SALTY (has L - already ruled out)
- STARK (has T in position 2, but no A after)
- STAND (has T in position 2, A in position 3 - this fits)
- SAVAT (not a valid word)
- SCATS (has T in position 5 - fits S _ A _ T)

STAND seems like a good next guess as it places T in position 2 (which is allowed since T just needs to be in the word, not necessarily in position 4).

From the feedback so far we know the word starts exactly as **S T A** and the last two letters are **not I or R**.  
Also, letters already ruled out: L, E, N, D, I, R.

We need a 5-letter word of the form **S T A _ _** using any letters except those six.  
Common remaining consonants for position 4: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, Z.  
Common vowels left: O, U (since A is already used in position 3).

Let’s list possibilities:
- **STAB** + any letter: STABO (invalid), STABY (invalid), STAB? – nothing valid.
- **STAC** + any letter: STACH (invalid), STAC? – nothing.
- **STAG** + any letter: STAGS (valid), STAGE (E is ruled out), STAGY (valid).
- **STAY** + any letter: STAYS (valid), STAY? – nothing.
- **STAX** + any letter: STAX? – nothing.
- **STAW** + any letter: STAW? – nothing.
- **STAW** + any letter: STAW? – nothing.

Valid words left:
- STAGS (G and S – S already in word, but allowed)
- STAGE (invalid, E ruled out)
- STAGY (Y is allowed)
- STAYS (Y is allowed)

Among these, **STAYS** uses two common letters (Y and S) and hasn’t been tried.  
Another good candidate is **STAGS**.  
Between them, **STAYS** feels slightly more common and uses Y, which is still allowed.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should include several of these.

Some popular first guesses are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers five very common letters and has a good mix of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the correct first position (✓)
- A is in the correct third position (✓)
- T is in the word but not in the fourth position (-)
- L and E are not in the word at all (x)

So far we know:
- Word pattern: S _ A _ _
- Contains T somewhere after the third position (positions 2, 4, or 5)
- Does NOT contain L or E

Looking at common 5-letter words starting with S, having A in the third position, and containing T somewhere after the A:
Possible patterns: S T A _ _ or S _ A T _ or S _ A _ T

Let me brainstorm:
- SATIN (has I, N - but no T after A)
- SALTY (has L - already ruled out)
- STARK (has T in position 2, but no A after)
- STAND (has T in position 2, A in position 3 - this fits)
- SAVAT (not a valid word)
- SCATS (has T in position 5 - fits S _ A _ T)

STAND seems like a good next guess as it places T in position 2 (which is allowed since T just needs to be in the word, not necessarily in position 4).

Current known facts:
1. Pattern: S T A _ _
2. Letters not in the word: L, E, N, D
3. We still need two more letters for positions 4 and 5.

Common letters left to try (excluding already ruled out letters): B, C, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter words matching S T A _ _:
- STARK – uses K (valid, but K is uncommon)
- STAIR – uses I and R (both common)
- STAMP – uses M and P (both common)
- STAGS – uses G and S (but S already used)
- STALE – uses L and E (both ruled out)
- STAND – already guessed
- STASH – uses H and S (S already used)

STAIR seems like a strong next guess because:
- It fits the pattern S T A I R
- Uses common letters I and R
- Has not been tried before
