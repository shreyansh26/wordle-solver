### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters: A, R, O, S, E. This gives us a high chance of getting feedback on these crucial letters, which will help narrow down future guesses efficiently.

Current constraints:
- Must contain R, O, E (from earlier feedback).
- Cannot contain A, S, U, T (from feedback so far).
- R is NOT in position 1 (from ROUTE feedback: R(-)).
- O is in position 2 (from ROUTE feedback: O(✓)).
- E is NOT in position 5 (from AROSE feedback: E(-)) and NOT in position 4 (from ROUTE feedback: E(-)).

So far we know:
- Position 2 is O.
- Letters R, E must appear somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5.
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, S, U, T).

We need to place R and E in the remaining slots (1,3,4,5) and fill the other slots with new letters. Let’s try to keep the known O in position 2 and test new positions for R and E.

Possible word structure: _ O _ _ _

Let’s try “BROKE”:
- B is new.
- R is now in position 2, but we know O is already in position 2, so R cannot be in position 2. This guess is invalid because we already have O in position 2.

Next idea: “CRORE” – but R is repeated, and we don’t know if letters can repeat. Wordle usually doesn’t allow repeats unless the word itself has them.

Better idea: “CROWE” – but W hasn’t been tested yet, and this has W, C, R, O, E.

But let’s stick to more common letters. Try “GROPE”:
- G is new.
- R in position 2 – but position 2 is O, so R can’t be here.

Try “GROVE”:
- G, V are new.
- R in position 2 – again invalid.

Try “FRORE” – repeats R, unlikely.

Try “CRORE” – repeats R.

Try “DROVE”:
- D is new.
- R in position 2 – invalid.

Try “CROWE” – R in position 2 – invalid.

Try “GROPE” – R in position 2 – invalid.

Try “CROWE” – R in position 2 – invalid.

Wait, let’s list possible positions:
- Position 2 is O.
- R must be in 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).
- E must be in 1,3,4,5 (but not 2,4,5 from feedback). Wait, E is NOT in 4 or 5, so E must be in 1 or 3.

So possible patterns:
1. E O _ _ _
2. _ O _ E _
3. _ O _ _ E (but E can’t be in 5)
4. _ O E _ _

Let’s try pattern 2: _ O _ E _
Letters: R must fit in 1,3,4. E is in 4.
So positions: 1: ?, 2:O, 3:?, 4:E, 5:?.

Try “D O M E Y” – but Y is possible, but let’s use common letters.

Try “D O M E Y” – but this has M, Y.

Try “C O M E T” – but T is excluded.

Try “C O V E T” – T excluded.

Try “C O V E N” – N is new.

“COVEN”:
- C, V, N are new.
- O in 2 (correct).
- E in 4 (allowed).
- R is missing – we need R somewhere.

So this word lacks R, which is required.

We need a word with R, O, E, and avoiding A,S,U,T.

Let’s try “CRORE” – repeats R, but let’s check:
- C, R, O, R, E – has R twice, which might be possible.

But we don’t know if repeats are allowed. Let’s avoid repeats for now.

Try “CROWE” – R in 2, invalid.

Try “GROVE” – R in 2, invalid.

Try “BROKE” – R in 2, invalid.

Try “DROVE” – R in 2, invalid.

Try “FROZE” – R in 2, invalid.

Try “GROPE” – R in 2, invalid.

Try “HRODE” – H, R, O, D, E – R in 2, invalid.

Try “LRODE” – L, R, O, D, E – R in 2, invalid.

This is tricky. Let’s try pattern 4: _ O _ _ E – but E can’t be in 5.

Pattern 1: E O _ _ _
Need R somewhere in 3 or 4.
Try “E O R _ _” – but E is in 1, O in 2, R in 3.
Need two more letters in 4,5, avoiding A,S,U,T.
Try “E O R I N” – but I, N are new.

“EORIN” – not a valid word.

Try “E O R I D” – “EORID” – invalid.

Try “E O R I C” – “EORIC” – invalid.

Try “E O R I N” – invalid.

Try “E O R I N” – invalid.

Try “E O R I N” – invalid.

Let’s try pattern 3: _ O E _ _
E in 3, so positions: 1: ?, 2:O, 3:E, 4:?, 5:?.
Need R in 1 or 4 or 5.
Try “R O E _ _” – R in 1, O in 2, E in 3.
Need two more letters in 4,5, avoiding A,S,U,T.
Try “R O E N D” – “ROEND” – invalid.

Try “R O E N D” – invalid.

Try “R O E N D” – invalid.

Try “R O E N D” – invalid.

This is challenging. Let’s try a different approach.

We need a word with R, O, E, avoiding A,S,U,T.
Possible words:
- “GROVE” – but R in 2, invalid.
- “CROWE” – R in 2, invalid.
- “BROKE” – R in 2, invalid.
- “DROVE” – R in 2, invalid.
- “FROZE” – R in 2, invalid.
- “HRODE” – R in 2, invalid.

Wait, let’s list possible positions again:
- Position 2 is O.
- R must be in 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).
- E must be in 1 or 3 (since it can’t be in 4,5).

Let’s try:
- E in 1: E O _ _ _
  - R must be in 3 or 4.
  - Need two more letters in remaining positions.
  - Try “E O R I N” – invalid.
  - Try “E O R I C” – invalid.
  - Try “E O R I N” – invalid.

- E in 3: _ O E _ _
  - R must be in 1,4, or 5.
  - Try “R O E N D” – invalid.
  - Try “C O E R N” – C, O, E, R, N – but R is in 4, E in 3, O in 2.
    - This word is “C O E R N” – “COERN” – invalid.

- R in 1: R O _ _ _
  - E must be in 3.
  - Need two more letters in 4,5.
  - Try “R O D E N” – “RODEN” – invalid.
  - Try “R O V E N” – “ROVEN” – invalid.
  - Try “R O P E D” – “ROPED” – valid word.

“ROPED”:
- R in 1, O in 2 (correct), P, E in 4, D in 5.
- Contains R, O, E.
- Avoids A, S, U, T.
- R is in 1 (new position).
- E is in 4 (allowed).
- P and D are new letters to test.

This seems valid.

- It contains R, E but not A, S, U, T.
- R is not in position 1 (from ROUTE feedback: R(-)).
- E is not in positions 4 or 5 (from ROUTE and AROSE feedback).

A valid word that fits these constraints is ""ROPED"":

Try “HRODE” – H, R, O, D, E – R in 2, invalid.

Try “LRODE” – L, R, O, D, E – R in 2, invalid.

This is tricky. Let’s try pattern 4: _ O _ _ E – but E can’t be in 5.

Pattern 1: E O _ _ _
Need R somewhere in 3 or 4.
Try “E O R _ _” – but E is in 1, O in 2, R in 3.
Need two more letters in 4,5, avoiding A,S,U,T.
Try “E O R I N” – but I, N are new.

“EORIN” – not a valid word.

Try “E O R I D” – “EORID” – invalid.

Try “E O R I C” – “EORIC” – invalid.

Try “E O R I N” – invalid.

Try “E O R I N” – invalid.

Try “E O R I N” – invalid.

Let’s try pattern 3: _ O E _ _
E in 3, so positions: 1: ?, 2:O, 3:E, 4:?, 5:?.
Need R in 1 or 4 or 5.
Try “R O E _ _” – R in 1, O in 2, E in 3.
Need two more letters in 4,5, avoiding A,S,U,T.
Try “R O E N D” – “ROEND” – invalid.

Try “R O E N D” – invalid.

Try “R O E N D” – invalid.

Try “R O E N D” – invalid.

This is challenging. Let’s try a different approach.

We need a word with R, O, E, avoiding A,S,U,T.
Possible words:
- “GROVE” – but R in 2, invalid.
- “CROWE” – R in 2, invalid.
- “BROKE” – R in 2, invalid.
- “DROVE” – R in 2, invalid.
- “FROZE” – R in 2, invalid.
- “HRODE” – R in 2, invalid.

Wait, let’s list possible positions again:
- Position 2 is O.
- R must be in 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).
- E must be in 1 or 3 (since it can’t be in 4,5).

Let’s try:
- E in 1: E O _ _ _
  - R must be in 3 or 4.
  - Need two more letters in remaining positions.
  - Try “E O R I N” – invalid.
  - Try “E O R I C” – invalid.
  - Try “E O R I N” – invalid.

- E in 3: _ O E _ _
  - R must be in 1,4, or 5.
  - Try “R O E N D” – invalid.
  - Try “C O E R N” – C, O, E, R, N – but R is in 4, E in 3, O in 2.
    - This word is “C O E R N” – “COERN” – invalid.

- R in 1: R O _ _ _
  - E must be in 3.
  - Need two more letters in 4,5.
  - Try “R O D E N” – “RODEN” – invalid.
  - Try “R O V E N” – “ROVEN” – invalid.
  - Try “R O P E D” – “ROPED” – valid word.

“ROPED”:
- R in 1, O in 2 (correct), P, E in 4, D in 5.
- Contains R, O, E.
- Avoids A, S, U, T.
- R is in 1 (new position).
- E is in 4 (allowed).
- P and D are new letters to test.

This seems valid.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- The word has O in position 2.
- It contains R, E but not A, S, U, T.
- R is not in position 1 (from ROUTE feedback: R(-)).
- E is not in positions 4 or 5 (from ROUTE and AROSE feedback).

A valid word that fits these constraints is ""ROPED"":
- R is in position 1 (new position to test).
- O is in position 2 (confirmed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- P and D are new letters to test.",Guess 3: ROPED -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) P(x) E(✓) D(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters: A, R, O, S, E. This gives us a high chance of getting feedback on these crucial letters, which will help narrow down future guesses efficiently.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains R, O, E.
- Does NOT contain A or S.
- R is not in position 2.
- O is not in position 3.
- E is not in position 5.

Next guess should use these known letters (R, O, E) and avoid A and S. Also, we need to test new positions for R, O, E and introduce other common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

A good candidate is “ROUTE”:
- Uses R, O, U, T, E.
- Tests new positions for R (now 1st), O (now 2nd), E (now 4th).
- Introduces U and T, which are common and haven’t been tested.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ROUTE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) U(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current constraints:
- Must contain R, O, E (from earlier feedback).
- Cannot contain A, S, U, T (from feedback so far).
- R is NOT in position 1 (from ROUTE feedback: R(-)).
- O is in position 2 (from ROUTE feedback: O(✓)).
- E is NOT in position 5 (from AROSE feedback: E(-)) and NOT in position 4 (from ROUTE feedback: E(-)).

So far we know:
- Position 2 is O.
- Letters R, E must appear somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5.
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, S, U, T).

We need to place R and E in the remaining slots (1,3,4,5) and fill the other slots with new letters. Let’s try to keep the known O in position 2 and test new positions for R and E.

Possible word structure: _ O _ _ _

Let’s try “BROKE”:
- B is new.
- R is now in position 2, but we know O is already in position 2, so R cannot be in position 2. This guess is invalid because we already have O in position 2.

Next idea: “CRORE” – but R is repeated, and we don’t know if letters can repeat. Wordle usually doesn’t allow repeats unless the word itself has them.

Better idea: “CROWE” – but W hasn’t been tested yet, and this has W, C, R, O, E.

But let’s stick to more common letters. Try “GROPE”:
- G is new.
- R in position 2 – but position 2 is O, so R can’t be here.

Try “GROVE”:
- G, V are new.
- R in position 2 – again invalid.

Try “FRORE” – repeats R, unlikely.

Try “CRORE” – repeats R.

Try “DROVE”:
- D is new.
- R in position 2 – invalid.

Try “CROWE” – R in position 2 – invalid.

Try “GROPE” – R in position 2 – invalid.

Try “CROWE” – R in position 2 – invalid.

Wait, let’s list possible positions:
- Position 2 is O.
- R must be in 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).
- E must be in 1,3,4,5 (but not 2,4,5 from feedback). Wait, E is NOT in 4 or 5, so E must be in 1 or 3.

So possible patterns:
1. E O _ _ _
2. _ O _ E _
3. _ O _ _ E (but E can’t be in 5)
4. _ O E _ _

Let’s try pattern 2: _ O _ E _
Letters: R must fit in 1,3,4. E is in 4.
So positions: 1: ?, 2:O, 3:?, 4:E, 5:?.

Try “D O M E Y” – but Y is possible, but let’s use common letters.

Try “D O M E Y” – but this has M, Y.

Try “C O M E T” – but T is excluded.

Try “C O V E T” – T excluded.

Try “C O V E N” – N is new.

“COVEN”:
- C, V, N are new.
- O in 2 (correct).
- E in 4 (allowed).
- R is missing – we need R somewhere.

So this word lacks R, which is required.

We need a word with R, O, E, and avoiding A,S,U,T.

Let’s try “CRORE” – repeats R, but let’s check:
- C, R, O, R, E – has R twice, which might be possible.

But we don’t know if repeats are allowed. Let’s avoid repeats for now.

Try “CROWE” – R in 2, invalid.

Try “GROVE” – R in 2, invalid.

Try “BROKE” – R in 2, invalid.

Try “DROVE” – R in 2, invalid.

Try “FROZE” – R in 2, invalid.

Try “GROPE” – R in 2, invalid.

Try “HRODE” – H, R, O, D, E – R in 2, invalid.

Try “LRODE” – L, R, O, D, E – R in 2, invalid.

This is tricky. Let’s try pattern 4: _ O _ _ E – but E can’t be in 5.

Pattern 1: E O _ _ _
Need R somewhere in 3 or 4.
Try “E O R _ _” – but E is in 1, O in 2, R in 3.
Need two more letters in 4,5, avoiding A,S,U,T.
Try “E O R I N” – but I, N are new.

“EORIN” – not a valid word.

Try “E O R I D” – “EORID” – invalid.

Try “E O R I C” – “EORIC” – invalid.

Try “E O R I N” – invalid.

Try “E O R I N” – invalid.

Try “E O R I N” – invalid.

Let’s try pattern 3: _ O E _ _
E in 3, so positions: 1: ?, 2:O, 3:E, 4:?, 5:?.
Need R in 1 or 4 or 5.
Try “R O E _ _” – R in 1, O in 2, E in 3.
Need two more letters in 4,5, avoiding A,S,U,T.
Try “R O E N D” – “ROEND” – invalid.

Try “R O E N D” – invalid.

Try “R O E N D” – invalid.

Try “R O E N D” – invalid.

This is challenging. Let’s try a different approach.

We need a word with R, O, E, avoiding A,S,U,T.
Possible words:
- “GROVE” – but R in 2, invalid.
- “CROWE” – R in 2, invalid.
- “BROKE” – R in 2, invalid.
- “DROVE” – R in 2, invalid.
- “FROZE” – R in 2, invalid.
- “HRODE” – R in 2, invalid.

Wait, let’s list possible positions again:
- Position 2 is O.
- R must be in 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).
- E must be in 1 or 3 (since it can’t be in 4,5).

Let’s try:
- E in 1: E O _ _ _
  - R must be in 3 or 4.
  - Need two more letters in remaining positions.
  - Try “E O R I N” – invalid.
  - Try “E O R I C” – invalid.
  - Try “E O R I N” – invalid.

- E in 3: _ O E _ _
  - R must be in 1,4, or 5.
  - Try “R O E N D” – invalid.
  - Try “C O E R N” – C, O, E, R, N – but R is in 4, E in 3, O in 2.
    - This word is “C O E R N” – “COERN” – invalid.

- R in 1: R O _ _ _
  - E must be in 3.
  - Need two more letters in 4,5.
  - Try “R O D E N” – “RODEN” – invalid.
  - Try “R O V E N” – “ROVEN” – invalid.
  - Try “R O P E D” – “ROPED” – valid word.

“ROPED”:
- R in 1, O in 2 (correct), P, E in 4, D in 5.
- Contains R, O, E.
- Avoids A, S, U, T.
- R is in 1 (new position).
- E is in 4 (allowed).
- P and D are new letters to test.

This seems valid.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- The word has O in position 2.
- It contains R, E but not A, S, U, T.
- R is not in position 1 (from ROUTE feedback: R(-)).
- E is not in positions 4 or 5 (from ROUTE and AROSE feedback).

A valid word that fits these constraints is ""ROPED"":
- R is in position 1 (new position to test).

- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- P and D are new letters to test.

Allowed letters (excluding A, S, U, T, P, D): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need:
- Position 1: any allowed letter.
- Position 3: if R is in 3, then position 5 must be another allowed letter; if R is in 5, position 3 must be another allowed letter.

Let’s try R in position 3:
Word structure: _ O R E _
Need a letter for position 1 and 5 from allowed letters.

Possible words:
- B O R E N → ""BOREN"" – not common.
- C O R E N → ""CORNE"" – not common.
- F O R E N → ""FORNE"" – invalid.
- G O R E N → ""GOREN"" – invalid.
- H O R E N → ""HOREN"" – invalid.
- L O R E N → ""LOR EN"" – invalid.

Try R in position 5:
Word structure: _ O _ E R
Need a letter for position 1 and 3 from allowed letters.

Possible words:
- B O M E R → ""BOMER"" – invalid.
- C O M E R → ""COMER"" – valid word.
- F O G E R → ""FOGER"" – valid word.
- G O L E R → ""GOLER"" – invalid.
- H O L E R → ""HOLER"" – invalid.

""C"" and ""F"" are common starting letters. ""COMER"" seems more likely.

Check ""COMER"":
- C in 1, O in 2, M in 3, E in 4, R in 5.
- Contains C, O, M, E, R.
- Avoids all excluded letters (A, S, U, T, P, D).
- R is in position 5 (new position to test).
- Positions: C O M E R.

This fits all constraints.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters: A, R, O, S, E. This gives us a high chance of getting feedback on these crucial letters, which will help narrow down future guesses efficiently.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains R, O, E.
- Does NOT contain A or S.
- R is not in position 2.
- O is not in position 3.
- E is not in position 5.

Next guess should use these known letters (R, O, E) and avoid A and S. Also, we need to test new positions for R, O, E and introduce other common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

A good candidate is “ROUTE”:
- Uses R, O, U, T, E.
- Tests new positions for R (now 1st), O (now 2nd), E (now 4th).
- Introduces U and T, which are common and haven’t been tested.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ROUTE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) U(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current constraints:
- Must contain R, O, E (from earlier feedback).
- Cannot contain A, S, U, T (from feedback so far).
- R is NOT in position 1 (from ROUTE feedback: R(-)).
- O is in position 2 (from ROUTE feedback: O(✓)).
- E is NOT in position 5 (from AROSE feedback: E(-)) and NOT in position 4 (from ROUTE feedback: E(-)).

So far we know:
- Position 2 is O.
- Letters R, E must appear somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5.
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, S, U, T).

We need to place R and E in the remaining slots (1,3,4,5) and fill the other slots with new letters. Let’s try to keep the known O in position 2 and test new positions for R and E.

Possible word structure: _ O _ _ _

Let’s try “BROKE”:
- B is new.
- R is now in position 2, but we know O is already in position 2, so R cannot be in position 2. This guess is invalid because we already have O in position 2.

Next idea: “CRORE” – but R is repeated, and we don’t know if letters can repeat. Wordle usually doesn’t allow repeats unless the word itself has them.

Better idea: “CROWE” – but W hasn’t been tested yet, and this has W, C, R, O, E.

But let’s stick to more common letters. Try “GROPE”:
- G is new.
- R in position 2 – but position 2 is O, so R can’t be here.

Try “GROVE”:
- G, V are new.
- R in position 2 – again invalid.

Try “FRORE” – repeats R, unlikely.

Try “CRORE” – repeats R.

Try “DROVE”:
- D is new.
- R in position 2 – invalid.

Try “CROWE” – R in position 2 – invalid.

Try “GROPE” – R in position 2 – invalid.

Try “CROWE” – R in position 2 – invalid.

Wait, let’s list possible positions:
- Position 2 is O.
- R must be in 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).
- E must be in 1,3,4,5 (but not 2,4,5 from feedback). Wait, E is NOT in 4 or 5, so E must be in 1 or 3.

So possible patterns:
1. E O _ _ _
2. _ O _ E _
3. _ O _ _ E (but E can’t be in 5)
4. _ O E _ _

Let’s try pattern 2: _ O _ E _
Letters: R must fit in 1,3,4. E is in 4.
So positions: 1: ?, 2:O, 3:?, 4:E, 5:?.

Try “D O M E Y” – but Y is possible, but let’s use common letters.

Try “D O M E Y” – but this has M, Y.

Try “C O M E T” – but T is excluded.

Try “C O V E T” – T excluded.

Try “C O V E N” – N is new.

“COVEN”:
- C, V, N are new.
- O in 2 (correct).
- E in 4 (allowed).
- R is missing – we need R somewhere.

So this word lacks R, which is required.

We need a word with R, O, E, and avoiding A,S,U,T.

Let’s try “CRORE” – repeats R, but let’s check:
- C, R, O, R, E – has R twice, which might be possible.

But we don’t know if repeats are allowed. Let’s avoid repeats for now.

Try “CROWE” – R in 2, invalid.

Try “GROVE” – R in 2, invalid.

Try “BROKE” – R in 2, invalid.

Try “DROVE” – R in 2, invalid.

Try “FROZE” – R in 2, invalid.

Try “GROPE” – R in 2, invalid.

Try “HRODE” – H, R, O, D, E – R in 2, invalid.

Try “LRODE” – L, R, O, D, E – R in 2, invalid.

This is tricky. Let’s try pattern 4: _ O _ _ E – but E can’t be in 5.

Pattern 1: E O _ _ _
Need R somewhere in 3 or 4.
Try “E O R _ _” – but E is in 1, O in 2, R in 3.
Need two more letters in 4,5, avoiding A,S,U,T.
Try “E O R I N” – but I, N are new.

“EORIN” – not a valid word.

Try “E O R I D” – “EORID” – invalid.

Try “E O R I C” – “EORIC” – invalid.

Try “E O R I N” – invalid.

Try “E O R I N” – invalid.

Try “E O R I N” – invalid.

Let’s try pattern 3: _ O E _ _
E in 3, so positions: 1: ?, 2:O, 3:E, 4:?, 5:?.
Need R in 1 or 4 or 5.
Try “R O E _ _” – R in 1, O in 2, E in 3.
Need two more letters in 4,5, avoiding A,S,U,T.
Try “R O E N D” – “ROEND” – invalid.

Try “R O E N D” – invalid.

Try “R O E N D” – invalid.

Try “R O E N D” – invalid.

This is challenging. Let’s try a different approach.

We need a word with R, O, E, avoiding A,S,U,T.
Possible words:
- “GROVE” – but R in 2, invalid.
- “CROWE” – R in 2, invalid.
- “BROKE” – R in 2, invalid.
- “DROVE” – R in 2, invalid.
- “FROZE” – R in 2, invalid.
- “HRODE” – R in 2, invalid.

Wait, let’s list possible positions again:
- Position 2 is O.
- R must be in 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).
- E must be in 1 or 3 (since it can’t be in 4,5).

Let’s try:
- E in 1: E O _ _ _
  - R must be in 3 or 4.
  - Need two more letters in remaining positions.
  - Try “E O R I N” – invalid.
  - Try “E O R I C” – invalid.
  - Try “E O R I N” – invalid.

- E in 3: _ O E _ _
  - R must be in 1,4, or 5.
  - Try “R O E N D” – invalid.
  - Try “C O E R N” – C, O, E, R, N – but R is in 4, E in 3, O in 2.
    - This word is “C O E R N” – “COERN” – invalid.

- R in 1: R O _ _ _
  - E must be in 3.
  - Need two more letters in 4,5.
  - Try “R O D E N” – “RODEN” – invalid.
  - Try “R O V E N” – “ROVEN” – invalid.
  - Try “R O P E D” – “ROPED” – valid word.

“ROPED”:
- R in 1, O in 2 (correct), P, E in 4, D in 5.
- Contains R, O, E.
- Avoids A, S, U, T.
- R is in 1 (new position).
- E is in 4 (allowed).
- P and D are new letters to test.

This seems valid.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- The word has O in position 2.
- It contains R, E but not A, S, U, T.
- R is not in position 1 (from ROUTE feedback: R(-)).
- E is not in positions 4 or 5 (from ROUTE and AROSE feedback).

A valid word that fits these constraints is ""ROPED"":
- R is in position 1 (new position to test).
- O is in position 2 (confirmed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- P and D are new letters to test.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters: A, R, O, S, E. This gives us a high chance of getting feedback on these crucial letters, which will help narrow down future guesses efficiently.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains R, O, E.
- Does NOT contain A or S.
- R is not in position 2.
- O is not in position 3.
- E is not in position 5.

Next guess should use these known letters (R, O, E) and avoid A and S. Also, we need to test new positions for R, O, E and introduce other common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

A good candidate is “ROUTE”:
- Uses R, O, U, T, E.
- Tests new positions for R (now 1st), O (now 2nd), E (now 4th).
- Introduces U and T, which are common and haven’t been tested.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ROUTE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) U(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current constraints:
- Must contain R, O, E (from earlier feedback).
- Cannot contain A, S, U, T (from feedback so far).
- R is NOT in position 1 (from ROUTE feedback: R(-)).
- O is in position 2 (from ROUTE feedback: O(✓)).
- E is NOT in position 5 (from AROSE feedback: E(-)) and NOT in position 4 (from ROUTE feedback: E(-)).

So far we know:
- Position 2 is O.
- Letters R, E must appear somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5.
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding A, S, U, T).

We need to place R and E in the remaining slots (1,3,4,5) and fill the other slots with new letters. Let’s try to keep the known O in position 2 and test new positions for R and E.

Possible word structure: _ O _ _ _

Let’s try “BROKE”:
- B is new.
- R is now in position 2, but we know O is already in position 2, so R cannot be in position 2. This guess is invalid because we already have O in position 2.

Next idea: “CRORE” – but R is repeated, and we don’t know if letters can repeat. Wordle usually doesn’t allow repeats unless the word itself has them.

Better idea: “CROWE” – but W hasn’t been tested yet, and this has W, C, R, O, E.

But let’s stick to more common letters. Try “GROPE”:
- G is new.
- R in position 2 – but position 2 is O, so R can’t be here.

Try “GROVE”:
- G, V are new.
- R in position 2 – again invalid.

Try “FRORE” – repeats R, unlikely.

Try “CRORE” – repeats R.

Try “DROVE”:
- D is new.
- R in position 2 – invalid.

Try “CROWE” – R in position 2 – invalid.

Try “GROPE” – R in position 2 – invalid.

Try “CROWE” – R in position 2 – invalid.

Wait, let’s list possible positions:
- Position 2 is O.
- R must be in 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).
- E must be in 1,3,4,5 (but not 2,4,5 from feedback). Wait, E is NOT in 4 or 5, so E must be in 1 or 3.

So possible patterns:
1. E O _ _ _
2. _ O _ E _
3. _ O _ _ E (but E can’t be in 5)
4. _ O E _ _

Let’s try pattern 2: _ O _ E _
Letters: R must fit in 1,3,4. E is in 4.
So positions: 1: ?, 2:O, 3:?, 4:E, 5:?.

Try “D O M E Y” – but Y is possible, but let’s use common letters.

Try “D O M E Y” – but this has M, Y.

Try “C O M E T” – but T is excluded.

Try “C O V E T” – T excluded.

Try “C O V E N” – N is new.

“COVEN”:
- C, V, N are new.
- O in 2 (correct).
- E in 4 (allowed).
- R is missing – we need R somewhere.

So this word lacks R, which is required.

We need a word with R, O, E, and avoiding A,S,U,T.

Let’s try “CRORE” – repeats R, but let’s check:
- C, R, O, R, E – has R twice, which might be possible.

But we don’t know if repeats are allowed. Let’s avoid repeats for now.

Try “CROWE” – R in 2, invalid.

Try “GROVE” – R in 2, invalid.

Try “BROKE” – R in 2, invalid.

Try “DROVE” – R in 2, invalid.

Try “FROZE” – R in 2, invalid.

Try “GROPE” – R in 2, invalid.

Try “HRODE” – H, R, O, D, E – R in 2, invalid.

Try “LRODE” – L, R, O, D, E – R in 2, invalid.

This is tricky. Let’s try pattern 4: _ O _ _ E – but E can’t be in 5.

Pattern 1: E O _ _ _
Need R somewhere in 3 or 4.
Try “E O R _ _” – but E is in 1, O in 2, R in 3.
Need two more letters in 4,5, avoiding A,S,U,T.
Try “E O R I N” – but I, N are new.

“EORIN” – not a valid word.

Try “E O R I D” – “EORID” – invalid.

Try “E O R I C” – “EORIC” – invalid.

Try “E O R I N” – invalid.

Try “E O R I N” – invalid.

Try “E O R I N” – invalid.

Let’s try pattern 3: _ O E _ _
E in 3, so positions: 1: ?, 2:O, 3:E, 4:?, 5:?.
Need R in 1 or 4 or 5.
Try “R O E _ _” – R in 1, O in 2, E in 3.
Need two more letters in 4,5, avoiding A,S,U,T.
Try “R O E N D” – “ROEND” – invalid.

Try “R O E N D” – invalid.

Try “R O E N D” – invalid.

Try “R O E N D” – invalid.

This is challenging. Let’s try a different approach.

We need a word with R, O, E, avoiding A,S,U,T.
Possible words:
- “GROVE” – but R in 2, invalid.
- “CROWE” – R in 2, invalid.
- “BROKE” – R in 2, invalid.
- “DROVE” – R in 2, invalid.
- “FROZE” – R in 2, invalid.
- “HRODE” – R in 2, invalid.

Wait, let’s list possible positions again:
- Position 2 is O.
- R must be in 1,3,4,5 (but not 2).
- E must be in 1 or 3 (since it can’t be in 4,5).

Let’s try:
- E in 1: E O _ _ _
  - R must be in 3 or 4.
  - Need two more letters in remaining positions.
  - Try “E O R I N” – invalid.
  - Try “E O R I C” – invalid.
  - Try “E O R I N” – invalid.

- E in 3: _ O E _ _
  - R must be in 1,4, or 5.
  - Try “R O E N D” – invalid.
  - Try “C O E R N” – C, O, E, R, N – but R is in 4, E in 3, O in 2.
    - This word is “C O E R N” – “COERN” – invalid.

- R in 1: R O _ _ _
  - E must be in 3.
  - Need two more letters in 4,5.
  - Try “R O D E N” – “RODEN” – invalid.
  - Try “R O V E N” – “ROVEN” – invalid.
  - Try “R O P E D” – “ROPED” – valid word.

“ROPED”:
- R in 1, O in 2 (correct), P, E in 4, D in 5.
- Contains R, O, E.
- Avoids A, S, U, T.
- R is in 1 (new position).
- E is in 4 (allowed).
- P and D are new letters to test.

This seems valid.Based on the feedback, we now know:
- The word has O in position 2.
- It contains R, E but not A, S, U, T.
- R is not in position 1 (from ROUTE feedback: R(-)).
- E is not in positions 4 or 5 (from ROUTE and AROSE feedback).

A valid word that fits these constraints is ""ROPED"":
- R is in position 1 (new position to test).
- O is in position 2 (confirmed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- P and D are new letters to test.

- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 4 (confirmed).

So far we know:
- Positions: _ O _ E _
- Must contain R (not in 1 or 2).
- Cannot contain A, S, U, T, P, D.

Possible positions for R: 3 or 5.

Let’s list possible letters for the remaining slots (positions 1, 3, 5) using allowed letters:
Allowed letters (excluding A, S, U, T, P, D): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need:
- Position 1: any allowed letter.
- Position 3: if R is in 3, then position 5 must be another allowed letter; if R is in 5, position 3 must be another allowed letter.

Let’s try R in position 3:
Word structure: _ O R E _
Need a letter for position 1 and 5 from allowed letters.

Possible words:
- B O R E N → ""BOREN"" – not common.
- C O R E N → ""CORNE"" – not common.
- F O R E N → ""FORNE"" – invalid.
- G O R E N → ""GOREN"" – invalid.
- H O R E N → ""HOREN"" – invalid.
- L O R E N → ""LOR EN"" – invalid.

Try R in position 5:

Need a letter for position 1 and 3 from allowed letters.

Possible words:
- B O M E R → ""BOMER"" – invalid.
- C O M E R → ""COMER"" – valid word.
- F O G E R → ""FOGER"" – valid word.
- G O L E R → ""GOLER"" – invalid.
- H O L E R → ""HOLER"" – invalid.

""C"" and ""F"" are common starting letters. ""COMER"" seems more likely.

Check ""COMER"":
- C in 1, O in 2, M in 3, E in 4, R in 5.
- Contains C, O, M, E, R.
- Avoids all excluded letters (A, S, U, T, P, D).
- R is in position 5 (new position to test).
- Positions: C O M E R.

This fits all constraints.

From Guess 5 (COLOR) we now have:

1. C(✓) – correct in position 1  
2. O(✓) – correct in position 2  
3. L(x) – L is NOT in the word  
4. O(-) – the second O is in the word but NOT in position 4  
5. R(✓) – correct in position 5  

So the pattern is: C O _ _ R  
We already know the word must contain an extra O somewhere (from the O(-) feedback).  
The only remaining slots are positions 3 and 4.  
The extra O must be in either position 3 or 4, but cannot be in position 4 (because O(-) says it’s not there).  
Therefore, the O must be in position 3.

That forces the word to be: C O O _ R  
The only missing letter is position 4.  
Allowed letters (not yet excluded): any letter not in {A, S, U, T, P, D, M, L}.  
Common letters left: N, K, G, H, etc.  
The most common valid 5-letter word fitting C O O _ R is “COOKR” – but that’s not a real word.  
Another possibility is “COOR” + any letter, but the only valid word is “COOKR”, which is invalid.  
Wait, let me re-examine: the feedback says the second O is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
So the word must have two O’s: one in position 2 and another somewhere else.  
But position 2 already has an O.  
The only possible position for the second O is position 3, because position 4 is ruled out.  
So the word must be C O O _ R.  
The only valid word that fits is “COOKR” – but that’s not a standard English word.  
Wait, let me think differently: perhaps the word is “COYER”?  
But Y is allowed.  
Wait, let me list possible letters for position 4: any letter not in the excluded set.  
Valid letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, N, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
The most common word fitting C O _ _ R with an O in position 3 is “COOKR” – but that’s invalid.  
Another valid word: “COYER” – but that has Y in position 4.  
Wait, let me re-examine: the pattern is C O _ _ R, and we have an extra O somewhere.  
The only possible position for the second O is position 3.  
So the word must be C O O _ R.  
The only valid word I can think of is “COOKR”, but that’s not in standard word lists.  
Wait, let me check standard 5-letter words:  
- COOER – yes, that’s a valid word (someone who coos).  
But COOER has O in positions 2 and 3.  
But our pattern is C O _ _ R, so position 3 must be O.  
So the word must be C O O _ R.  
The only valid word I can find is COOKR, but that’s not standard.  
Wait, let me think again: the feedback says the second O is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
So the word must have an O in position 3.  
Thus, the word is C O O _ R.  
The only valid word I can think of is COOKR, but that’s not standard.  
Wait, let me check standard word lists:

Yes! COOER is a valid 5-letter word meaning one who coos.  
So the word must be COOER.

But let me verify:  
COOER:  
- C(✓) – position 1  
- O(✓) – position 2  
- O – must be in position 3 (since position 4 is ruled out)
