For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should cover as many of these as possible.

Looking at these letters, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us a broad coverage of frequently used letters in English 5-letter words, which should help narrow down the possibilities efficiently.

- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

- Must contain L, A, E somewhere in positions 1-4

Possible patterns: _ _ _ _ R with L, A, E in the first four positions.

One simple permutation is to place L, A, E in positions 1, 2, 3 (order to test) and see if it forms a valid word. The remaining letter in position 4 would need to be a consonant we haven’t ruled out yet (common unused consonants: N, M, D, P, etc.).

Let's summarize everything we know after the three guesses.

Letters we know are in the word:
- L, A, E, R (from the “-” and “✓” feedback)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
- S, T, C, F

Positions we know:
- R is in position 5 (from CLEAR: R(✓))

Positions we know are wrong for L, A, E:
- From SLATE: L not in 2, A not in 3, E not in 5
- From CLEAR: L not in 3, E not in 4, A not in 4
- From FLARE: L not in 2, A not in 3, E not in 4

So the four letters L, A, E, R must occupy positions 1-4 and 5 (with R fixed at 5). The remaining three positions (1-4) must contain L, A, E in some order, and one additional letter that we haven’t used yet and that is NOT in the forbidden list (S, T, C, F).

Common unused consonants: N, M, D, P, G, H, etc.

Let’s try to form a valid 5-letter word ending in R with L, A, E and one new consonant.

Possible permutations of L, A, E in positions 1-4:
- L, A, E in positions 1, 2, 3 → need a 4th letter
- A, L, E in positions 1, 2, 3 → need a 4th letter
- etc.

Let’s try “GLARE”:
- G is new, not yet ruled out
- L, A, E, R
- Ends with R (position 5)
- Letters: G, L, A, R, E – all allowed
- Forms a valid word

This seems like a good next guess to test G and confirm positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should cover as many of these as possible.

Looking at these letters, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us a broad coverage of frequently used letters in English 5-letter words, which should help narrow down the possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word contains the letters L, A, E but not S or T.  
The positions of L, A, E are unknown (but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively).

Good next guess should:
1. Keep L, A, E (since they’re confirmed present)
2. Avoid S and T
3. Introduce new common letters to test

A word that satisfies this is “CLEAR”:
- It contains L, A, E (already confirmed)
- It introduces C, R, which are common consonants
- It avoids S and T
- The new letters C and R will help narrow down possibilities

- Confirms R is in the word AND in the 5th position (✓ at position 5)
- Reinforces that L, A, E are in the word but not in their previous positions
- Adds C as a letter NOT in the word

So far we know:
- Word ends with R (position 5 = R)
- Must contain L, A, E somewhere in positions 1-4
- Cannot contain S, T, C

We need a 5-letter word ending in R that includes L, A, E in some permutation of the first four letters. Let’s list possible arrangements:

Possible patterns: _ _ _ _ R with L, A, E in the first four positions.

One simple permutation is to place L, A, E in positions 1, 2, 3 (order to test) and see if it forms a valid word. The remaining letter in position 4 would need to be a consonant we haven’t ruled out yet (common unused consonants: N, M, D, P, etc.).

A good candidate is “FLARE”:
- Ends with R (✓ position 5)
- Contains F (new letter to test), L, A, E
- Avoids S, T, C
- Forms a valid English word

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should cover as many of these as possible.

Looking at these letters, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- S (very common)
- L (common)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us a broad coverage of frequently used letters in English 5-letter words, which should help narrow down the possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is not in the word (x)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- T is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word contains the letters L, A, E but not S or T.  
The positions of L, A, E are unknown (but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively).

Good next guess should:
1. Keep L, A, E (since they’re confirmed present)
2. Avoid S and T
3. Introduce new common letters to test

A word that satisfies this is “CLEAR”:
- It contains L, A, E (already confirmed)
- It introduces C, R, which are common consonants
- It avoids S and T
- The new letters C and R will help narrow down possibilities

One simple permutation is to place L, A, E in positions 1, 2, 3 (order to test) and see if it forms a valid word. The remaining letter in position 4 would need to be a consonant we haven’t ruled out yet (common unused consonants: N, M, D, P, etc.).

A good candidate is “FLARE”:
- Ends with R (✓ position 5)
- Contains F (new letter to test), L, A, E
- Avoids S, T, C
- Forms a valid English word

Let’s use FLARE.

Here is some previous feedback:

Let's summarize everything we know after the three guesses.

Letters we know are in the word:
- L, A, E, R (from the “-” and “✓” feedback)

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
- S, T, C, F

Positions we know:
- R is in position 5 (from CLEAR: R(✓))

Positions we know are wrong for L, A, E:
- From SLATE: L not in 2, A not in 3, E not in 5
- From CLEAR: L not in 3, E not in 4, A not in 4
- From FLARE: L not in 2, A not in 3, E not in 4

So the four letters L, A, E, R must occupy positions 1-4 and 5 (with R fixed at 5). The remaining three positions (1-4) must contain L, A, E in some order, and one additional letter that we haven’t used yet and that is NOT in the forbidden list (S, T, C, F).

Common unused consonants: N, M, D, P, G, H, etc.

Let’s try to form a valid 5-letter word ending in R with L, A, E and one new consonant.

Possible permutations of L, A, E in positions 1-4:
- L, A, E in positions 1, 2, 3 → need a 4th letter
- A, L, E in positions 1, 2, 3 → need a 4th letter
- etc.

Let’s try “GLARE”:
- G is new, not yet ruled out
- L, A, E, R
- Ends with R (position 5)
- Letters: G, L, A, R, E – all allowed
- Forms a valid word

This seems like a good next guess to test G and confirm positions.

We now know:
- R is fixed in position 5.
- The word must contain L, A, E somewhere in positions 1-4.
- Forbidden letters so far: S, T, C, F, G.
- Forbidden positions for L, A, E (from all feedback):
  – L not in 2, 3
  – A not in 3, 4
  – E not in 4, 5 (but 5 is R, so only 4)

That leaves only positions 1 and 4 open for the remaining two letters among L, A, E. The fourth position must be one of L, A, or E, and the fifth is R.

We need a 5-letter word ending in R with exactly one of L, A, E in position 4 and the other two in positions 1-3. The missing letter in positions 1-3 must be a consonant we haven’t tried yet (common unused consonants: N, M, D, P, H, etc.).

Let’s try “MELAR” – but that’s not a valid word.  
How about “LAMER”:
- L in 1, A in 2, M in 3, E in 4, R in 5.
- Contains L, A, E, R.
- M hasn’t been ruled out.
- Forms a valid word.

This should confirm positions for L, A, E and test M.

From the feedback on LAMER:
- L is in position 1 (✓)
- A is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- R is in position 5 (✓)
- M is not in the word (x)

So the word is L A _ E R, with the missing letter in position 3.

Testing:
- L A N E R → “LANER” (valid)
- L A D E R → “LADER” (not a common word)
