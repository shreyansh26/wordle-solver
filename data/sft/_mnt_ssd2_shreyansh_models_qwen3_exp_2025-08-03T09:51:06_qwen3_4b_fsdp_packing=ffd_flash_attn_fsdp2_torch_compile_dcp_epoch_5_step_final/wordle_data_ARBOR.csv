For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

One of the most common starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, another popular choice is ""CRANE"" or ""RAISE"". 

I think ""AROSE"" is also a strong first guess as it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters in English. This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present and their possible positions.

After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it covers five very common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities early on.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R is in the correct second position (✓)
- O is in the word but not in the third position (-)
- S is not in the word at all (x)
- E is not in the word at all (x)

So the pattern so far is:
A R _ _ _  (positions 1-2 locked)
Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, E
Letters we know are in the word somewhere: O (but not in position 3)

We need to test possible letters for positions 3-5. Since O cannot be in position 3, it must be in 4 or 5. Let’s try a word that places O in position 4 and introduces new common letters for positions 3 and 5.

A good candidate is ""AROMA"":
- Keeps A and R fixed
- Moves O to position 4
- Introduces M and A (but we already know A is in position 1, so M is new)

This will test if O is in position 4 and introduce M as a new letter to check.

Let's update what we know from all three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - Positions 1 & 2 are A R _ _ _
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S and E are out.

2. AROMA → A(✓) R(✓) O(-) M(x) A(-)
   - Still A R _ _ _
   - O is not in positions 3 or 5.
   - M is out.
   - A is in the word but not in position 5.

3. ARATO → A(✓) R(✓) A(-) T(x) O(-)
   - Still A R _ _ _
   - A is not in position 3 (because the third letter got “-”).
   - T is out.
   - O is not in position 5 (because it got “-”).

So far:
- Pattern: A R _ _ _
- O must be in position 4 (only spot left where O can fit without conflict).
- A must be in position 3 (only remaining spot for A, since it’s not in 1, 3 is next).
- Therefore the word is A R A O _
- We need a fifth letter we haven’t tried yet. Common unused letters: N, L, C, D, etc.

The only common word that fits is “ARANO” or “ARACH” but “ARACH” isn’t common. The most likely candidate is “ARANO” (though not super common). A better common word is “AROMA” but we already tried that. Wait, we need a new letter.

Actually, looking at common 5-letter words starting AR… with A in position 3 and O in 4, the only common one is “AROMA” which we already tried. Hmm, maybe we missed something.

Wait, let’s re-examine the constraints:
- A R _ _ _
- Position 3: must be A (since it’s the only remaining spot for A, because position 5 got “-” and position 1 is A).
- Position 4: must be O (since O must be in the word and can’t be 3 or 5).
- So the word is A R A O _
- The fifth letter must be a new letter we haven’t used: possible letters left are B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M (out), N, P, Q, R (out), T (out), U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters left: N, L, C, D, etc.

The most common word fitting this pattern is “ARACH” (not valid), “AROMA” (tried), “ARABS” (wrong length). Actually, the word must be A R A O _.

Looking at a word list, “AROAS” isn’t valid. The only valid word I can find is “AROMA” but we tried that. This suggests we might have made an error.

Wait, let’s double-check the constraints:
- A is in position 1 (✓)
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- O is in the word but not 3 or 5 → must be 4
- A is in the word but not 5 → must be 3
- So the word must be A R A O _

The only valid 5-letter word fitting this exact pattern is “AROMA” which we already tried. This implies we need to re-examine our deductions.

Wait, in guess 3 (ARATO), the feedback was:
A(✓) R(✓) A(-) T(x) O(-)

This means:
- A is in position 3 but in the wrong place (since it got “-”), but we already have A in position 1. This suggests our earlier deduction that A must be in position 3 is incorrect.

Let me re-express the feedback:

1. AROSE: A(✓) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - Positions 1 & 2: A R _ _ _
   - O is in word, not in position 3.
   - S, E out.

2. AROMA: A(✓) R(✓) O(-) M(x) A(-)
   - Positions 1 & 2: A R _ _ _
   - O is in word, not in positions 3 or 5.
   - M out.
   - A is in word, not in position 5.

3. ARATO: A(✓) R(✓) A(-) T(x) O(-)
   - Positions 1 & 2: A R _ _ _
   - A is in word, not in position 3.
   - T out.
   - O is in word, not in position 5.

So now we see:
- A is in positions 1 and 3, but position 3 got “-” meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. This is a contradiction because we already have A in position 1. This implies our earlier assumption was wrong.

Actually, the feedback for ARATO:
- A(✓) R(✓) A(-) T(x) O(-)
means:
- A is in position 1 (✓)
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (so position 3 is not A)
- T is out
- O is in the word but not in position 5

So the pattern is still A R _ _ _ but:
- O must be in position 4 (since it can't be 3 or 5)
- Position 3 must be a new letter (not A, S, E, M, T)
- Position 5 must be a new letter (not O, S, E, M, T)

Common letters left: N, L, C, D, etc.

Possible words:
- A R _ O _
Looking for common words: A R C O N, A R M O R (but M out), A R D O R (but D and R are possible), A R G O N, A R M O N (M out), A R S O N (S out), A R L O W (not common).

The most common valid word is ""ARCON"" (but not very common). Another is ""ARGON"".

Let’s try ""ARGON"":
- A R G O N
- Tests G and N for positions 3 and 5.

This seems like the best next guess.

Based on the updated constraints:
- A R _ _ _
- O must be in position 4
- Position 3 must be a new letter (not A, S, E, M, T)

This means:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

One of the most common starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, another popular choice is ""CRANE"" or ""RAISE"". 

I think ""AROSE"" is also a strong first guess as it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters in English. This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present and their possible positions.

After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it covers five very common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities early on.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R is in the correct second position (✓)
- O is in the word but not in the third position (-)
- S is not in the word at all (x)
- E is not in the word at all (x)

So the pattern so far is:
A R _ _ _  (positions 1-2 locked)
Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, E
Letters we know are in the word somewhere: O (but not in position 3)

We need to test possible letters for positions 3-5. Since O cannot be in position 3, it must be in 4 or 5. Let’s try a word that places O in position 4 and introduces new common letters for positions 3 and 5.

A good candidate is ""AROMA"":
- Keeps A and R fixed
- Moves O to position 4
- Introduces M and A (but we already know A is in position 1, so M is new)

This will test if O is in position 4 and introduce M as a new letter to check.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - Pattern: A R _ _ _
   - Letters known: A, R are fixed in positions 1 and 2.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - S and E are not in the word.

2. AROMA → A(✓) R(✓) O(-) M(x) A(-)
   - Pattern: A R _ _ _
   - O is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (because in AROMA, O was in position 3 and got “-”, and the last A got “-”, so A cannot be in position 5 either).
   - M is not in the word.
   - The second A in position 5 is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- A R _ _ _
- O must be in position 4 (since it cannot be in 3 or 5).
- A must be in position 3 (since the second A in position 5 got “-”, so A cannot be in 5, and we already have A in 1, so the only remaining spot for A is 3).
- Therefore the pattern is: A R A O _
- The last letter (position 5) must be a new letter we haven’t tested yet.

Letters we haven’t tried yet that are common: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A good candidate is “ARATO”:
- A R A O T
- Uses the pattern we deduced and tests T for position 5.

Let's update what we know from all three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - Positions 1 & 2 are A R _ _ _
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S and E are out.

2. AROMA → A(✓) R(✓) O(-) M(x) A(-)
   - Still A R _ _ _
   - O is not in positions 3 or 5.
   - M is out.
   - A is in the word but not in position 5.

3. ARATO → A(✓) R(✓) A(-) T(x) O(-)
   - Still A R _ _ _
   - A is not in position 3 (because the third letter got “-”).
   - T is out.
   - O is not in position 5 (because it got “-”).

So far:
- Pattern: A R _ _ _
- O must be in position 4 (only spot left where O can fit without conflict).
- A must be in position 3 (only remaining spot for A, since it’s not in 1, 3 is next).
- Therefore the word is A R A O _
- We need a fifth letter we haven’t tried yet. Common unused letters: N, L, C, D, etc.

The only common word that fits is “ARANO” or “ARACH” but “ARACH” isn’t common. The most likely candidate is “ARANO” (though not super common). A better common word is “AROMA” but we already tried that. Wait, we need a new letter.

Actually, looking at common 5-letter words starting AR… with A in position 3 and O in 4, the only common one is “AROMA” which we already tried. Hmm, maybe we missed something.

Wait, let’s re-examine the constraints:
- A R _ _ _
- Position 3: must be A (since it’s the only remaining spot for A, because position 5 got “-” and position 1 is A).
- Position 4: must be O (since O must be in the word and can’t be 3 or 5).
- So the word is A R A O _
- The fifth letter must be a new letter we haven’t used: possible letters left are B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M (out), N, P, Q, R (out), T (out), U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters left: N, L, C, D, etc.

The most common word fitting this pattern is “ARACH” (not valid), “AROMA” (tried), “ARABS” (wrong length). Actually, the word must be A R A O _.

Looking at a word list, “AROAS” isn’t valid. The only valid word I can find is “AROMA” but we tried that. This suggests we might have made an error.

Wait, let’s double-check the constraints:
- A is in position 1 (✓)
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- O is in the word but not 3 or 5 → must be 4
- A is in the word but not 5 → must be 3
- So the word must be A R A O _

The only valid 5-letter word fitting this exact pattern is “AROMA” which we already tried. This implies we need to re-examine our deductions.

Wait, in guess 3 (ARATO), the feedback was:
A(✓) R(✓) A(-) T(x) O(-)

This means:
- A is in position 3 but in the wrong place (since it got “-”), but we already have A in position 1. This suggests our earlier deduction that A must be in position 3 is incorrect.

Let me re-express the feedback:

1. AROSE: A(✓) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - Positions 1 & 2: A R _ _ _
   - O is in word, not in position 3.
   - S, E out.

2. AROMA: A(✓) R(✓) O(-) M(x) A(-)
   - Positions 1 & 2: A R _ _ _
   - O is in word, not in positions 3 or 5.
   - M out.
   - A is in word, not in position 5.

3. ARATO: A(✓) R(✓) A(-) T(x) O(-)
   - Positions 1 & 2: A R _ _ _
   - A is in word, not in position 3.
   - T out.
   - O is in word, not in position 5.

So now we see:
- A is in positions 1 and 3, but position 3 got “-” meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. This is a contradiction because we already have A in position 1. This implies our earlier assumption was wrong.

Actually, the feedback for ARATO:
- A(✓) R(✓) A(-) T(x) O(-)
means:
- A is in position 1 (✓)
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (so position 3 is not A)
- T is out
- O is in the word but not in position 5

So the pattern is still A R _ _ _ but:
- O must be in position 4 (since it can't be 3 or 5)
- Position 3 must be a new letter (not A, S, E, M, T)
- Position 5 must be a new letter (not O, S, E, M, T)

Common letters left: N, L, C, D, etc.

Possible words:

Looking for common words: A R C O N, A R M O R (but M out), A R D O R (but D and R are possible), A R G O N, A R M O N (M out), A R S O N (S out), A R L O W (not common).

The most common valid word is ""ARCON"" (but not very common). Another is ""ARGON"".

Let’s try ""ARGON"":
- A R G O N
- Tests G and N for positions 3 and 5.

This seems like the best next guess.Based on the updated constraints:
- A R _ _ _
- O must be in position 4
- Position 3 must be a new letter (not A, S, E, M, T)
- Position 5 must be a new letter (not O, S, E, M, T)

The most common valid word fitting this pattern is ""ARGON"".

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

One of the most common starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it includes S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, another popular choice is ""CRANE"" or ""RAISE"". 

I think ""AROSE"" is also a strong first guess as it contains A, R, O, S, E - five of the most common letters in English. This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present and their possible positions.

After considering these options, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it covers five very common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities early on.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(x)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- R is in the correct second position (✓)
- O is in the word but not in the third position (-)
- S is not in the word at all (x)
- E is not in the word at all (x)

So the pattern so far is:
A R _ _ _  (positions 1-2 locked)
Letters we know are NOT in the word: S, E
Letters we know are in the word somewhere: O (but not in position 3)

We need to test possible letters for positions 3-5. Since O cannot be in position 3, it must be in 4 or 5. Let’s try a word that places O in position 4 and introduces new common letters for positions 3 and 5.

A good candidate is ""AROMA"":
- Keeps A and R fixed
- Moves O to position 4
- Introduces M and A (but we already know A is in position 1, so M is new)

This will test if O is in position 4 and introduce M as a new letter to check.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - Pattern: A R _ _ _
   - Letters known: A, R are fixed in positions 1 and 2.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - S and E are not in the word.

2. AROMA → A(✓) R(✓) O(-) M(x) A(-)
   - Pattern: A R _ _ _
   - O is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (because in AROMA, O was in position 3 and got “-”, and the last A got “-”, so A cannot be in position 5 either).
   - M is not in the word.
   - The second A in position 5 is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- A R _ _ _
- O must be in position 4 (since it cannot be in 3 or 5).
- A must be in position 3 (since the second A in position 5 got “-”, so A cannot be in 5, and we already have A in 1, so the only remaining spot for A is 3).
- Therefore the pattern is: A R A O _
- The last letter (position 5) must be a new letter we haven’t tested yet.

Letters we haven’t tried yet that are common: T, N, L, C, D, etc.

A good candidate is “ARATO”:
- A R A O T
- Uses the pattern we deduced and tests T for position 5.

Let's update what we know from all three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(✓) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - Positions 1 & 2 are A R _ _ _
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - S and E are out.

2. AROMA → A(✓) R(✓) O(-) M(x) A(-)
   - Still A R _ _ _
   - O is not in positions 3 or 5.
   - M is out.
   - A is in the word but not in position 5.

3. ARATO → A(✓) R(✓) A(-) T(x) O(-)
   - Still A R _ _ _
   - A is not in position 3 (because the third letter got “-”).
   - T is out.
   - O is not in position 5 (because it got “-”).

So far:
- Pattern: A R _ _ _
- O must be in position 4 (only spot left where O can fit without conflict).
- A must be in position 3 (only remaining spot for A, since it’s not in 1, 3 is next).
- Therefore the word is A R A O _
- We need a fifth letter we haven’t tried yet. Common unused letters: N, L, C, D, etc.

The only common word that fits is “ARANO” or “ARACH” but “ARACH” isn’t common. The most likely candidate is “ARANO” (though not super common). A better common word is “AROMA” but we already tried that. Wait, we need a new letter.

Actually, looking at common 5-letter words starting AR… with A in position 3 and O in 4, the only common one is “AROMA” which we already tried. Hmm, maybe we missed something.

Wait, let’s re-examine the constraints:
- A R _ _ _
- Position 3: must be A (since it’s the only remaining spot for A, because position 5 got “-” and position 1 is A).
- Position 4: must be O (since O must be in the word and can’t be 3 or 5).
- So the word is A R A O _
- The fifth letter must be a new letter we haven’t used: possible letters left are B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M (out), N, P, Q, R (out), T (out), U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters left: N, L, C, D, etc.

The most common word fitting this pattern is “ARACH” (not valid), “AROMA” (tried), “ARABS” (wrong length). Actually, the word must be A R A O _.

Looking at a word list, “AROAS” isn’t valid. The only valid word I can find is “AROMA” but we tried that. This suggests we might have made an error.

Wait, let’s double-check the constraints:
- A is in position 1 (✓)
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- O is in the word but not 3 or 5 → must be 4
- A is in the word but not 5 → must be 3
- So the word must be A R A O _

The only valid 5-letter word fitting this exact pattern is “AROMA” which we already tried. This implies we need to re-examine our deductions.

Wait, in guess 3 (ARATO), the feedback was:
A(✓) R(✓) A(-) T(x) O(-)

This means:
- A is in position 3 but in the wrong place (since it got “-”), but we already have A in position 1. This suggests our earlier deduction that A must be in position 3 is incorrect.

Let me re-express the feedback:

1. AROSE: A(✓) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - Positions 1 & 2: A R _ _ _
   - O is in word, not in position 3.
   - S, E out.

2. AROMA: A(✓) R(✓) O(-) M(x) A(-)
   - Positions 1 & 2: A R _ _ _
   - O is in word, not in positions 3 or 5.
   - M out.
   - A is in word, not in position 5.

3. ARATO: A(✓) R(✓) A(-) T(x) O(-)
   - Positions 1 & 2: A R _ _ _
   - A is in word, not in position 3.
   - T out.
   - O is in word, not in position 5.

So now we see:
- A is in positions 1 and 3, but position 3 got “-” meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. This is a contradiction because we already have A in position 1. This implies our earlier assumption was wrong.

Actually, the feedback for ARATO:
- A(✓) R(✓) A(-) T(x) O(-)
means:
- A is in position 1 (✓)
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (so position 3 is not A)
- T is out
- O is in the word but not in position 5

So the pattern is still A R _ _ _ but:
- O must be in position 4 (since it can't be 3 or 5)
- Position 3 must be a new letter (not A, S, E, M, T)
- Position 5 must be a new letter (not O, S, E, M, T)

Common letters left: N, L, C, D, etc.

Possible words:
- A R _ O _
Looking for common words: A R C O N, A R M O R (but M out), A R D O R (but D and R are possible), A R G O N, A R M O N (M out), A R S O N (S out), A R L O W (not common).

The most common valid word is ""ARCON"" (but not very common). Another is ""ARGON"".

Let’s try ""ARGON"":
- A R G O N
- Tests G and N for positions 3 and 5.

This seems like the best next guess.Based on the updated constraints:
- A R _ _ _
- O must be in position 4
- Position 3 must be a new letter (not A, S, E, M, T)
- Position 5 must be a new letter (not O, S, E, M, T)

Letters already ruled out: S, E, M, T, G, N  
Letters still available for positions 3 and 5: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a common 5-letter word that starts with AR and ends with O_, specifically AR _ O _.

Looking at common English words:
- ARBOL (Spanish loanword, uncommon)
- ARCOS (plural of arco, uncommon)
- ARDOR (but N is out, and R is already in position 4)
- ARGON (already tried)
- ARROW (but W is still possible, and O is in position 4)
- ARKOS (uncommon)
- ARFOS (uncommon)
- ARVOS (uncommon)

The only very common word fitting the pattern is ARROW:
- A R R O W
- It uses W for position 5 (not yet ruled out) and R for position 3 (not yet ruled out).

Let’s test ARROW.

Actually, the word must be A R A O _.\n\nLooking at a word list, “AROAS” isn’t valid. The only valid word I can find is “AROMA” but we tried that. This suggests we might have made an error.\n\nWait, let’s double-check the constraints:\n- A is in position 1 (✓)\n- R is in position 2 (✓)\n- O is in the word but not 3 or 5 → must be 4\n- A is in the word but not 5 → must be 3\n- So the word must be A R A O _\n\nThe only valid 5-letter word fitting this exact pattern is “AROMA” which we already tried.

This suggests our earlier deduction that A must be in position 3 is incorrect.\n\nLet me re-express the feedback:\n\n1. AROSE: A(✓) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(x)\n   - Positions 1 & 2: A R _ _ _\n   - O is in word, not in position 3.\n   - S, E out.\n\n2.

ARATO: A(✓) R(✓) A(-) T(x) O(-)\n   - Positions 1 & 2: A R _ _ _\n   - A is in word, not in position 3.\n   - T out.\n   - O is in word, not in position 5.\n\nSo now we see:\n- A is in positions 1 and 3, but position 3 got “-” meaning A is in the word but not in position 3. This is a contradiction because we already have A in position 1. This implies our earlier assumption was wrong.\n\nActually, the feedback for ARATO:\n- A(✓) R(✓) A(-) T(x) O(-)\nmeans:\n- A is in position 1 (✓)\n- R is in position 2 (✓)\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (so position 3 is not A)\n- T is out\n- O is in the word but not in position 5\n\nSo the pattern is still A R _ _ _ but:\n- O must be in position 4 (since it can\'t be 3 or 5)\n- Position 3 must be a new letter (not A, S, E, M, T)\n- Position 5 must be a new letter (not O, S, E, M, T)\n\nCommon letters left: N, L, C, D, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n- A R _ O _\nLooking for common words: A R C O N, A R M O R (but M out), A R D O R (but D and R are possible), A R G O N, A R M O N (M out), A R S O N (S out), A R L O W (not common).\n\nThe most common valid word is ""ARCON"" (but not very common). Another is ""ARGON"".\n\nLet’s try ""ARGON"":\n- A R G O N\n- Tests G and N for positions 3 and 5.\n\nThis seems like the best next guess.Based on the updated constraints:\n- A R _ _ _\n- O must be in position 4\n- Position 3 must be a new letter (not A, S, E, M, T)\n- Position 5 must be a new letter (not O, S, E, M, T)\n\nThe most common valid word fitting this pattern is ""ARGON"".\n\n<guess>ARGON</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: AROMA -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(✓) O(-) M(x) A(-)\nGuess 3: ARATO -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(✓) A(-) T(x) O(-)\nGuess 4: ARGON -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(✓) G(x) O(✓) N(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the latest feedback on ARGON:\n- A(✓) R(✓) G(x) O(✓) N(x)\n  – Positions 1, 2, and 4 are confirmed: A R _ O _\n  – G and N are not in the word.\n  \nSo the current pattern is: A R _ O _\n\nLetters already ruled out: S, E, M, T, G, N  \nLetters still available for positions 3 and 5: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need a common 5-letter word that starts with AR and ends with O_, specifically AR _ O _.\n\nLooking at common English words:\n- ARBOL (Spanish loanword, uncommon)\n- ARCOS (plural of arco, uncommon)\n- ARDOR (but N is out, and R is already in position 4)\n- ARGON (already tried)\n- ARROW (but W is still possible, and O is in position 4)\n- ARKOS (uncommon)\n- ARFOS (uncommon)\n- ARVOS (uncommon)\n\nThe only very common word fitting the pattern is ARROW:\n- A R R O W\n- It uses W for position 5 (not yet ruled out) and R for position 3 (not yet ruled out).\n\nLet’s test ARROW.\n\n<guess>ARROW</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(✓) O(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: AROMA -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(✓) O(-) M(x) A(-)\nGuess 3: ARATO -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(✓) A(-) T(x) O(-)\nGuess 4: ARGON -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(✓) G(x) O(✓) N(x)\nGuess 5: ARROW -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(✓) R(-) O(✓) W(x)\n'}]","<think>
