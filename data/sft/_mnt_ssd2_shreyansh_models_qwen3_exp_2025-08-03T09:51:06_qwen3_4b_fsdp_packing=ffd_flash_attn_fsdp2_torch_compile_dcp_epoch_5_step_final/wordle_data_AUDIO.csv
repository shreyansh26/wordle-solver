### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use some of these common letters without repeating any letters to test as many unique letters as possible.

Looking at these common letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This gives us a good spread of vowels and consonants to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(✓) → A is in the word and in the first position.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in the third position.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with A _ _ _ _
- Contains the letter O, but O is not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E.

We now want a new word that:
1. Starts with A.
2. Contains O, but O is not in position 3.
3. Does NOT contain R, S, or E.

Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are already known).

Let’s try “AUDIO”:
- Starts with A.
- Contains O (in position 4, so not violating the “not in position 3” constraint).
- Does not contain R, S, or E.

But “AUDIO” has U and I, which are new vowels we haven’t tested yet, and D is a new consonant. This seems like a good second guess to gather more information.
