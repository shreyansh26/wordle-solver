### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use some of these letters to quickly identify which are present or absent. Words like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""STARE"" are popular choices. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses five very common letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct first position (✓).
- R is not in the word (x).
- O is not in the word (x).
- S is in the word but not in the 4th position (-).
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (-).

So the secret word:
- Starts with A
- Does NOT contain R or O
- Contains S and E, but S is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5
- We need to place S and E somewhere else (positions 2,3,4,5) while keeping A in position 1.

Good next guesses would test new positions for S and E while avoiding R and O. A word like ""ASIDE"" would place S in position 2 and E in position 5, but E can't be in position 5. ""ASKEW"" has E in position 4, which is allowed. ""ADIEU"" has E in position 4 and S isn't present, so that's bad. ""ALEXE"" has E in position 5 which is invalid. ""ACRES"" has R which is invalid. ""ALONE"" has O which is invalid. ""AVISE"" has S in position 4 which is invalid. ""AVOID"" has O which is invalid. ""AXEON"" has O which is invalid. ""AXELS"" has S in position 5 which is allowed, but let's see.

""AXELS"" - A(✓), X(new), E(new), L(new), S(new). This tests S in position 5, which is allowed since S can't be in position 4. But we still need to test E's placement.

""ASIDE"" - A(✓), S(2), I(new), D(new), E(5) - but E can't be in 5.

""ASTON"" - A(✓), S(2), T(new), O(x) - invalid (has O).

""ASKEW"" - A(✓), S(2), K(new), E(4), W(new). This tests S in position 2 and E in position 4, which are both allowed. This seems like a good next guess to narrow down positions for S and E while introducing new letters.
