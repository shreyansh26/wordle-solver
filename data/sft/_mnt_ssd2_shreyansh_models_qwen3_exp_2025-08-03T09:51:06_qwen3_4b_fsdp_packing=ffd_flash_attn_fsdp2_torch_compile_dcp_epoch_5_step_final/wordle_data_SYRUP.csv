### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting letters in 5-letter English words include S, T, R, N, L, etc., while common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common letters to quickly identify which letters are present or absent in the secret word. 

One such word is ""SLATE"" - it contains S, L, A, T, E, which are all very common letters. This should give us good information about several potential letters in the secret word right from the start.

We need a 5-letter word that fits S _ R _ P, uses only allowed letters, and keeps R in position 3 and P in position 5.

Possible middle letters (positions 2 and 4):
- Position 2: any of B, D, F, G, K, M, V, W, Y, Z, U
- Position 4: any of B, D, F, G, K, M, V, W, Y, Z, U

Let’s list some words that fit S _ R _ P:
- S B R U P → SB RUP? Not a word.
- S D R U P → SDRUP? Not a word.
- S F R U P → SF RUP? Not a word.
- S G R U P → SGRUP? Not a word.
- S K R U P → SKRUP? Not a word.
- S M R U P → SMRUP? Not a word.
- S V R U P → SVRUP? Not a word.
- S W R U P → SWRUP? Not a word.
- S Y R U P → SYRUP – this is a valid word.

SYRUP fits the pattern S _ R _ P with Y in position 2 and U in position 4, and uses only allowed letters.

<guess>SYRUP</guess>",SYRUP,"From the new feedback on SCRIP:
- S is in position 1 (✓) – already known.
- C is not in the word (x).
- R is in the word and in the correct position 3 (✓).
- I is not in the word (x).
- P is in the word and in the correct position 5 (✓).

So far we know the pattern:
S _ R _ P

Letters already ruled out: L, A, T, E, H, O, N, C, I.

Remaining unused common letters (consonants and vowels):
