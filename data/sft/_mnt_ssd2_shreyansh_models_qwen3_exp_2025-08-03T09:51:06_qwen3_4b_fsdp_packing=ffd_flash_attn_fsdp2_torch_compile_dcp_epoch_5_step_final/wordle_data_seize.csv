### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should include several of these letters without repeating any. One such word is ""AROSE"" which contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This will help us quickly identify which of these key letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should include several of these letters without repeating any. One such word is ""AROSE"" which contains A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This will help us quickly identify which of these key letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains S somewhere other than position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or O.

We now need a 5-letter word ending in E that includes S (not in position 4) and avoids A, R, O.  
Good remaining common letters to test: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc.

A strong candidate is “STILE”:
- Ends with E (matches known position 5).
- Contains S (not in position 4, so could be 1, 2, 3).
- Uses common letters T, I, L.
- Avoids A, R, O.

Let’s try STILE.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word ends with E (position 5).
2. S is in the word and in the first position (position 1).
3. I is in the word and in the third position (position 3).
4. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, T, L.

So the pattern is: S _ I _ E

We need a 5-letter word that fits S _ I _ E and uses only letters not yet ruled out.  
Possible letters left to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters that fit: C, N, M, etc.

Candidate words:
- SCIBE – but B is less common and “SCIBE” isn’t a valid word.
- S M I L E – but L is already ruled out.
- S P I K E – P and K are allowed, and “SPIKE” is a valid word.
- S C I T E – T is ruled out.
- S N I T E – T is ruled out.
- S H I V E – V is allowed, but “SHIVE” is less common.
- S C I N E – “SCINE” is valid but uncommon.
- S P I C E – P and C are allowed, and “SPIKE” is a common word.

“SPIKE” fits the pattern S _ I _ E and uses allowed letters. Let’s try it.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.

So far we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains S somewhere other than position 4.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or O.

We now need a 5-letter word ending in E that includes S (not in position 4) and avoids A, R, O.  
Good remaining common letters to test: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, etc.

A strong candidate is “STILE”:
- Ends with E (matches known position 5).
- Contains S (not in position 4, so could be 1, 2, 3).
- Uses common letters T, I, L.
- Avoids A, R, O.

- S H I V E – V is allowed, but “SHIVE” is less common.
- S C I N E – “SCINE” is valid but uncommon.
- S P I C E – P and C are allowed, and “SPIKE” is a common word.

“SPIKE” fits the pattern S _ I _ E and uses allowed letters. Let’s try it.

We now know the pattern is S _ I _ E and the letters P and K are NOT in the word.  
Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, T, L, P, K.  
Remaining common letters that can fit positions 2 and 4: B, C, D, F, G, H, M, N, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word of the form S _ I _ E.  
Let’s list possible candidates:

- S B I N E → “SBINE” – not a valid word.
- S C I N E → “SCINE” – valid but uncommon.
- S C I T E → T is out.
- S D I N E → “SDINE” – not valid.
- S F I N E → “SFINE” – not valid.
- S G I N E → “SGINE” – not valid.
- S H I V E → “SHIVE” – valid but uncommon.
- S H I N E → “SHINE” – valid and common.
- S M I L E → L is out.
- S N I G E → G is allowed, but “SNIGE” is not valid.
- S N I T E → T is out.
- S N I V E → V is allowed, but “SNIVE” is not valid.
- S N I C E → “SNICE” – not valid.
- S N I D E → “SNIDE” – valid and common.

Between the valid options “SHINE” and “SNIDE”, both fit the pattern and use allowed letters.  
“SHINE” is more common, so we’ll try it first.

We now know the pattern is S _ I _ E and the letters NOT in the word are: A, R, O, T, L, P, K, H, N.  
Letters still allowed for positions 2 and 4: B, C, D, F, G, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word of the form S _ I _ E using only the allowed letters.  
Let’s list the remaining possibilities:

- S B I _ E → “SBINE” – not valid.
- S C I _ E → “SCITE” – not valid; “SCINE” is valid but uncommon.
- S D I _ E → “SDINE” – not valid.
- S F I _ E → “SFINE” – not valid.
- S G I _ E → “SGINE” – not valid.
- S M I _ E → “SMITE” – but T is out.
- S M I _ E → “SMIVE” – not valid.
- S C I _ E → “SCIBE” – not valid.
- S D I _ E → “SDIVE” – not valid.
- S V I _ E → “SVINE” – not valid.
- S C I _ E → “SCINE” – valid but uncommon.
- S C I _ E → “SCITE” – not valid.
- S C I _ E → “SCINE” is the only valid word left that fits.

“SCINE” is a valid word (though uncommon), and it uses C in position 2 and E in position 5 (already confirmed).  
Since we have exhausted all common letters and the only remaining valid word is “SCINE”, we must try it.
