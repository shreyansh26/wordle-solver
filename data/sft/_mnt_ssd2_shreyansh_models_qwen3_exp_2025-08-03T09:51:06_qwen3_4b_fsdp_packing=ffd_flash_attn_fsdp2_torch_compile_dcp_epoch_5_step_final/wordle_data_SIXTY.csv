### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word should include frequently used letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular starting choice because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering several high-frequency letters. This will help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

2. Has T in the 4th position
3. Does NOT contain L, A, or E

Possible candidates:

- STINK (contains N, I, K - but K is less common)
- STORM (contains O, R, M - good coverage)
- STOIC (contains O, I, C - good coverage)

From all feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S✓ _ _ T_  
2. STORM → S✓ T- _ _  
3. SWIFT → S✓ I- T- W(x) F(x)

Combining these:
- S is fixed in position 1
- T is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4
- I is in the word but NOT in position 3
- Letters ruled out: L, A, E, O, R, M, W, F

So the pattern is:
S _ _ _ _
with:
- T must appear exactly once in positions 3 or 5
- I must appear exactly once somewhere else (positions 2,4,5 if T is in 3, or 2,4 if T is in 5)

Possible positions for T:
- Position 3: S _ T _ _
- Position 5: S _ _ _ T

Let’s explore both.

Case 1: T in position 3 → S _ T _ _
Letters left: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z
We need two more letters (positions 2 and 4) from the allowed set, and one of them must be I (since I is in the word but not in position 3).

So possible words:
- S I T _ _ → need a letter for position 4 and 5, but T is already in 3, so no duplicate T
- S _ T I _ → but I can’t be in position 4 if T is in 3 (no restriction against it)
- S _ T _ I → I in position 5

Looking for valid words:
- SPLIT – L is ruled out
- SKINT – N is allowed, K is allowed → SKINT is 5 letters, fits S _ T _ _ (S K T _ _)? No, SKINT is S K I N T – doesn’t fit S _ T _ _
- S P I T _ – SPIT is 4 letters
- S U I T _ – SUITE has 5 letters but E is ruled out
- S C I T _ – SCINT is not a word
- S N I T _ – SNIT is 4 letters

Case 2: T in position 5 → S _ _ _ T
Now I must appear in positions 2 or 4 (not 3).

Possible words:
- S I _ _ T → need two letters in positions 3 and 4 from allowed set
- S _ I _ T → same

Looking for valid words:
- S I V O T – O is ruled out
- S I D E T – E is ruled out
- S I G H T – G, H are allowed → ""SIGHT"" is valid (variant spelling of ""sight"")

- S H I T _ – SHIT is 4 letters

""SIGHT"" (variant of ""sight"") is a valid word, fits S I G H T, and uses only allowed letters (G, H not yet ruled out).

Let’s verify:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word should include frequently used letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular starting choice because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering several high-frequency letters. This will help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in the first position (✓)
- T is correct in the fourth position (✓)
- L, A, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the pattern so far is:
S _ _ T _

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Has T in the 4th position
3. Does NOT contain L, A, or E
4. Uses only remaining common letters to maximize information gain

Common letters left to try: R, N, C, H, I, O, U, M, P, Y, etc.

Possible candidates:
- STIR_ (but needs 5 letters)
- STINK (contains N, I, K - but K is less common)
- STORM (contains O, R, M - good coverage)
- STOIC (contains O, I, C - good coverage)
- STUMP (contains U, M, P - good coverage)

""STORM"" seems strong as it covers O, R, M - all common letters not yet ruled out.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S✓ _ _ T_  (so word is S _ _ T _)
2. STORM → S✓ T- _ _  (so T is in the word but NOT in position 4)

Therefore the actual word must be:
- S _ _ T _  (from SLATE)
- S _ T _ _  (from STORM, since T is in the word but not in position 4)

Combining these two patterns we get:
S _ T _ _

Letters ruled out so far: L, A, E, O, R, M

Remaining common consonants: N, C, H, K, P, B, D, F, G, J, Q, X, Z, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A and E are out, O is out)

We need a 5-letter word that fits S _ T _ _ and uses only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- SITTY (but Y at end is allowed, T repeated is fine)
- SNITCH (too long)
- SKINT (but N is allowed)
- SKITT (but double T might be uncommon)
- SPLIT (but L is ruled out)
- SWIFT (but F is allowed, W is allowed)
- SWIFT seems good: S W I F T
- Check if any letters are ruled out: W, I, F are not ruled out yet.

- S is fixed in position 1
- T is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4
- I is in the word but NOT in position 3
- Letters ruled out: L, A, E, O, R, M, W, F

So the pattern is:
S _ _ _ _
with:
- T must appear exactly once in positions 3 or 5
- I must appear exactly once somewhere else (positions 2,4,5 if T is in 3, or 2,4 if T is in 5)

Possible positions for T:
- Position 3: S _ T _ _
- Position 5: S _ _ _ T

Let’s explore both.

Case 1: T in position 3 → S _ T _ _

We need two more letters (positions 2 and 4) from the allowed set, and one of them must be I (since I is in the word but not in position 3).

- S I T _ _ → need a letter for position 4 and 5, but T is already in 3, so no duplicate T
- S _ T I _ → but I can’t be in position 4 if T is in 3 (no restriction against it)
- S _ T _ I → I in position 5

Looking for valid words:
- SPLIT – L is ruled out
- SKINT – N is allowed, K is allowed → SKINT is 5 letters, fits S _ T _ _ (S K T _ _)? No, SKINT is S K I N T – doesn’t fit S _ T _ _
- S P I T _ – SPIT is 4 letters
- S U I T _ – SUITE has 5 letters but E is ruled out
- S C I T _ – SCINT is not a word
- S N I T _ – SNIT is 4 letters

Case 2: T in position 5 → S _ _ _ T
Now I must appear in positions 2 or 4 (not 3).

Possible words:
- S I _ _ T → need two letters in positions 3 and 4 from allowed set
- S _ I _ T → same

Looking for valid words:
- S I V O T – O is ruled out
- S I D E T – E is ruled out
- S I G H T – G, H are allowed → ""SIGHT"" is valid (variant spelling of ""sight"")
- S I N G T – not a word

- S C I T E – E ruled out
- S P I T E – E ruled out
- S N I T E – E ruled out
- S C I T _ – SCINT is not a word
- S H I T _ – SHIT is 4 letters

- S✓ I- G H T- → matches feedback (I is in word but not in position 3, T is in word but not in positions 2 or 4, and it fits S _ _ _ T pattern)

4. SIGHT → S✓ I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(-)  (I is in word and in position 2, T is in word but not in 5)

Combining these:
- S is fixed in position 1
- I is fixed in position 2
- T is in the word but NOT in positions 2,4,5 → therefore T must be in position 3
- Letters ruled out so far: L, A, E, O, R, M, W, F, G, H

So the pattern is: S I T _ _

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5 from the remaining allowed letters: B, C, D, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

Looking for valid 5-letter words that fit S I T _ _:

- SITAR – A is ruled out
- SITEN – E is ruled out
- SITED – E is ruled out

- SITIN – N is allowed → ""SITIN"" is a valid word (archaic term)

Between SITUP and SITIN, SITUP is more common.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information, the best strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word should include frequently used letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular starting choice because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering several high-frequency letters. This will help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in the first position (✓)
- T is correct in the fourth position (✓)
- L, A, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the pattern so far is:
S _ _ T _

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Has T in the 4th position
3. Does NOT contain L, A, or E
4. Uses only remaining common letters to maximize information gain

Common letters left to try: R, N, C, H, I, O, U, M, P, Y, etc.

Possible candidates:
- STIR_ (but needs 5 letters)
- STINK (contains N, I, K - but K is less common)
- STORM (contains O, R, M - good coverage)
- STOIC (contains O, I, C - good coverage)
- STUMP (contains U, M, P - good coverage)

""STORM"" seems strong as it covers O, R, M - all common letters not yet ruled out.

Guess 2: STORM -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(-) O(x) R(x) M(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S✓ _ _ T_  (so word is S _ _ T _)
2. STORM → S✓ T- _ _  (so T is in the word but NOT in position 4)

Therefore the actual word must be:
- S _ _ T _  (from SLATE)
- S _ T _ _  (from STORM, since T is in the word but not in position 4)

Combining these two patterns we get:
S _ T _ _

Letters ruled out so far: L, A, E, O, R, M

Remaining common consonants: N, C, H, K, P, B, D, F, G, J, Q, X, Z, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A and E are out, O is out)

We need a 5-letter word that fits S _ T _ _ and uses only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- SITTY (but Y at end is allowed, T repeated is fine)
- SNITCH (too long)
- SKINT (but N is allowed)
- SKITT (but double T might be uncommon)
- SPLIT (but L is ruled out)
- SWIFT (but F is allowed, W is allowed)
- SWIFT seems good: S W I F T
- Check if any letters are ruled out: W, I, F are not ruled out yet.

Let's go with SWIFT.

Guess 3: SWIFT -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) W(x) I(-) F(x) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S✓ _ _ T_  
2. STORM → S✓ T- _ _  
3. SWIFT → S✓ I- T- W(x) F(x)

Combining these:
- S is fixed in position 1
- T is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4
- I is in the word but NOT in position 3
- Letters ruled out: L, A, E, O, R, M, W, F

So the pattern is:
S _ _ _ _
with:
- T must appear exactly once in positions 3 or 5
- I must appear exactly once somewhere else (positions 2,4,5 if T is in 3, or 2,4 if T is in 5)

Possible positions for T:
- Position 3: S _ T _ _
- Position 5: S _ _ _ T

Let’s explore both.

Case 1: T in position 3 → S _ T _ _
Letters left: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z
We need two more letters (positions 2 and 4) from the allowed set, and one of them must be I (since I is in the word but not in position 3).

So possible words:
- S I T _ _ → need a letter for position 4 and 5, but T is already in 3, so no duplicate T
- S _ T I _ → but I can’t be in position 4 if T is in 3 (no restriction against it)
- S _ T _ I → I in position 5

Looking for valid words:
- SPLIT – L is ruled out
- SKINT – N is allowed, K is allowed → SKINT is 5 letters, fits S _ T _ _ (S K T _ _)? No, SKINT is S K I N T – doesn’t fit S _ T _ _
- S P I T _ – SPIT is 4 letters
- S U I T _ – SUITE has 5 letters but E is ruled out
- S C I T _ – SCINT is not a word
- S N I T _ – SNIT is 4 letters

Case 2: T in position 5 → S _ _ _ T
Now I must appear in positions 2 or 4 (not 3).

Possible words:
- S I _ _ T → need two letters in positions 3 and 4 from allowed set
- S _ I _ T → same

Looking for valid words:
- S I V O T – O is ruled out
- S I D E T – E is ruled out
- S I G H T – G, H are allowed → ""SIGHT"" is valid (variant spelling of ""sight"")
- S I N G T – not a word
- S U I T E – E is ruled out
- S U I T E – same
- S C I T E – E ruled out
- S P I T E – E ruled out
- S N I T E – E ruled out
- S C I T _ – SCINT is not a word
- S H I T _ – SHIT is 4 letters

""SIGHT"" (variant of ""sight"") is a valid word, fits S I G H T, and uses only allowed letters (G, H not yet ruled out).

Let’s verify:
- S✓ I- G H T- → matches feedback (I is in word but not in position 3, T is in word but not in positions 2 or 4, and it fits S _ _ _ T pattern)

Therefore, the next guess should be SIGHT.
