### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's optimal to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" ""ADIEU,"" or ""AUDIO."" 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should provide good initial coverage for the Wordle game.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word, but not in the 4th position.
- E(-) – E is in the word, but not in the 5th position.

So the secret word:
- Contains S and E somewhere, but S is not in position 4 and E is not in position 5.
- Does not contain A, R, or O.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S and E.
2. S is not in position 4.
3. E is not in position 5.
4. Does not have A, R, or O.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O are out and E is confirmed).

Possible candidates:
- STILE: S in 1, T in 2, I in 3, L in 4, E in 5. But E is in 5 (invalid).
- SLITE: S in 1, L in 2, I in 3, T in 4, E in 5. E in 5 invalid.
- STONE: S in 1, T in 2, O in 3 (invalid, O is out).
- STEIN: S in 1, T in 2, E in 3, I in 4, N in 5. S is in 1 (valid), E is in 3 (valid), no A/R/O. This seems good.
- STEPS: S in 1, T in 2, E in 3, P in 4, S in 5. S appears twice, but positions are okay (S not in 4, E not in 5). However, two S's might be less optimal.
- STILE: already seen issue with E in 5.

STEIN seems the best choice here: it uses S and E in valid positions, avoids A/R/O, and introduces new consonants T, N and vowel I.
