### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the two previous guesses:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   – A and R are in the word, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.  
   – O, S, E are absent.

2. train → T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)  
   – A and R are still in the word, but now we know:  
     – A is not in positions 3 or 1 (from arose and train).  
     – R is not in positions 2 or 3 (from arose and train).  
   – T, I, N are absent.

So far we know:
- Letters that must appear: A, R  
- Letters that must NOT appear: O, S, E, T, I, N  

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: U (since A is confirmed, and O, E, I are out)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and R.  
- Does NOT contain O, S, E, T, I, N.  
- Places A somewhere other than positions 1 or 3.  
- Places R somewhere other than positions 2 or 3.  

A good candidate is “CURAR” (but that’s not a standard word).  
Another is “GRAVY” – but Y is allowed, but V hasn’t been tested.  
Wait, let’s pick “CRAMP” – but P hasn’t been tested either.  
A more straightforward word is “GRAVY” – but G, V, Y are new letters.  
Actually, let’s try “GRAVY” first.  
But we need to ensure A and R are present.  
Let me think of a word that has A and R in allowed positions.  
How about “CARAB” – but B hasn’t been tested.  
A simpler word is “CARAT” – but T is out.  
Another is “CAROL” – but O is out.  
“CARAB” is invalid.  
“CARRI” – I is out.  
“CRAVY” – V is new, but let’s check positions:  
C(1) R(2) A(3) V(4) Y(5)  
But R cannot be in position 2 (from arose feedback), so this is invalid.  
Let’s try “DARMA” – but M hasn’t been tested, and positions: A is in 2 and 4 (allowed), R is in 3 (allowed).  
But is “DARMA” a valid word? Maybe not.  
Let’s pick “GRAVY” – positions: G(1) R(2) A(3) V(4) Y(5) – but R is in position 2 which is forbidden.  
Next idea: “CRAVE” – but E and V are new, and positions: C(1) R(2) A(3) V(4) E(5) – R in 2 is forbidden.  
Let me list possible positions for A and R:  
A can be in 2, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be 1 or 3).  
R can be in 1, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be 2 or 3).  

A word that fits: “RABID” – but I, D are new, and positions: R(1) A(2) B(3) I(4) D(5) – A is in 2 (allowed), R is in 1 (allowed).  
But I is out.  
Next: “RALLY” – L, Y are new, but A is in 2 and 4 (allowed), R is in 1 (allowed).  
But A is in 4 which is allowed, R is in 1 which is allowed.  
This seems valid.  

Another option: “RASPY” – but S is out.  
“RALLY” seems the best so far.  
Let me check “RALLY”:  
Letters: R, A, L, L, Y  
A is in position 2 (allowed), R is in position 1 (allowed).  
No forbidden letters (O, S, E, T, I, N).  
This should give new info on L and Y.

A good candidate is “CURAR” (but that’s not a standard word).  
Another is “GRAVY” – but Y is allowed, but V hasn’t been tested.  
Wait, let’s pick “CRAMP” – but P hasn’t been tested either.  
A more straightforward word is “GRAVY” – but G, V, Y are new letters.  
Actually, let’s try “GRAVY” first.  
But we need to ensure A and R are present.  
Let me think of a word that has A and R in allowed positions.  
How about “CARAB” – but B hasn’t been tested.  
A simpler word is “CARAT” – but T is out.  
Another is “CAROL” – but O is out.  
“CARAB” is invalid.  
“CARRI” – I is out.  
“CRAVY” – V is new, but let’s check positions:  
C(1) R(2) A(3) V(4) Y(5)  
But R cannot be in position 2 (from arose feedback), so this is invalid.  
Let’s try “DARMA” – but M hasn’t been tested, and positions: A is in 2 and 4 (allowed), R is in 3 (allowed).  
But is “DARMA” a valid word? Maybe not.  
Let’s pick “GRAVY” – positions: G(1) R(2) A(3) V(4) Y(5) – but R is in position 2 which is forbidden.  
Next idea: “CRAVE” – but E and V are new, and positions: C(1) R(2) A(3) V(4) E(5) – R in 2 is forbidden.  
Let me list possible positions for A and R:  
A can be in 2, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be 1 or 3).  
R can be in 1, 4, or 5 (since it can’t be 2 or 3).  

A word that fits: “RABID” – but I, D are new, and positions: R(1) A(2) B(3) I(4) D(5) – A is in 2 (allowed), R is in 1 (allowed).  
But I is out.  
Next: “RALLY” – L, Y are new, but A is in 2 and 4 (allowed), R is in 1 (allowed).  
But A is in 4 which is allowed, R is in 1 which is allowed.  
This seems valid.  

Another option: “RASPY” – but S is out.  
“RALLY” seems the best so far.  
Let me check “RALLY”:  
Letters: R, A, L, L, Y  
A is in position 2 (allowed), R is in position 1 (allowed).  
No forbidden letters (O, S, E, T, I, N).  
This should give new info on L and Y.  

Thus, I’ll guess “RALLY”.

From the new feedback on “rally”:

- R(✓) → R is in the word and is in position 1.  
- A(-) → A is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- L(x), L(x), Y(x) → L and Y are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- The word starts with R (R _ _ _ _).
- It contains A, but A is not in positions 1, 2, or 3.  
  Therefore A must be in position 4 or 5.
- Forbidden letters: O, S, E, T, I, N, L, Y.

Remaining consonants to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, M, P, U, V, W, Z  
Remaining vowels: U (A is confirmed, so only U left).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with R.  
- Has A in position 4 or 5.  
- Uses only allowed letters (no O, S, E, T, I, N, L, Y).  
- Uses remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, M, P, U, V, W, Z.

Possible patterns:
1. R _ _ A _  (A in 4)
2. R _ _ _ A  (A in 5)

Let’s brainstorm words:
- R _ _ A _ :  
  - RUACH – but H, U, C are allowed, but not sure if common.  
  - RUGBY – but Y is out.  
  - RAVEN – but N, E are out.  
  - RAPID – but I, D are out.  
  - RAVEL – but L, E are out.  
  - RAVEN – already out.  
  - RUGBY – Y is out.  
  - RUACH – seems obscure.  
  - RUMBA – M, B allowed, but U is allowed.  
  - RUMBA is valid and uses allowed letters.

- R _ _ _ A :  
  - RUMPY – Y is out.  
  - RUGED – E, D are out.  
  - RUDDA – D, A allowed, but D is allowed, but A is already in 5, but D is allowed.  
  - RUGED – E is out.  
  - RUDDA – seems possible, but not common.  
  - RUDDY – Y is out.  
  - RUGBY – Y is out.  
  - RUACH – already considered.  
  - RUMBA – already considered for A in 4.  
  - RUDDA – not common.  
  - RUMBA seems better for A in 4.

But let’s check RUMBA:
- R U M B A  
- Starts with R.  
- A is in position 5 (allowed).  
- Letters: U, M, B are allowed.  
- No forbidden letters.  
This seems valid.

Another candidate: RUACH (R U A C H) – but A is in position 3, which is forbidden.  
So RUMBA is the best choice.

Thus, the next guess is RUMBA.
