### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains 5 of the most common letters in English (A, R, O, S, E) and can help me quickly determine which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word. This will give me a good starting point to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1).
- R is not in the word.
- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S is not in the word.
- E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _ (with O in position 3).
- It contains A somewhere, but not in position 1.
- It does NOT contain R, S, or E.

Next, I want to test new common consonants and vowels. Since we already know O is in position 3, and A must appear somewhere else, I should try a word that:
1. Keeps O in position 3.
2. Places A in a new position (positions 2, 4, or 5).
3. Introduces new consonants that are common and haven’t been tested yet (like T, N, L, C, etc.).

A good candidate is “TANGO”:
- T (new consonant)
- A (must appear, now in position 2)
- N (new consonant)
- G (new consonant)
- O (already confirmed in position 3)

This will test T, N, G while placing A in position 2 and keeping O fixed.

From the two pieces of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - O is fixed in position 3.
   - A is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (because it was wrong in both spots).
   - R, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. TANGO → T(x) A(-) N(x) G(x) O(-)
   - T, N, G are NOT in the word.
   - A is still in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (because it was wrong in both spots).
   - O was marked “-” here, which is unusual because we already know O is in position 3. This likely means the feedback system treats O specially (since it’s already confirmed correct), but it reinforces that A cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5. Therefore, A must be in position 4.

So the pattern is now: _ _ O A _

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 3 and A in position 4.
- Does NOT contain R, S, E, T, N, G.
- Uses only the remaining common letters (e.g., C, L, M, P, U, etc.).

A quick scan of common words with that pattern gives “COALA” (but A repeats), “PLAID” (but D is less common), “PLAUS” (S is out), “MOCHA” (C, H, A are in). “MOCHA” fits: M, O, C, H, A with O in 3 and A in 4, and no forbidden letters.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, R, S, T, etc. \n\nOne such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains 5 of the most common letters in English (A, R, O, S, E) and can help me quickly determine which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word. This will give me a good starting point to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1).\n- R is not in the word.\n- O is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).\n- S is not in the word.\n- E is not in the word.\n\nSo far we know:\n- The word has the pattern _ _ O _ _ (with O in position 3).\n- It contains A somewhere, but not in position 1.\n- It does NOT contain R, S, or E.\n\nNext, I want to test new common consonants and vowels.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - O is fixed in position 3.
   - A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 5 (because it was wrong in AROSE and TANGO).
   - R, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. TANGO → T(x) A(-) N(x) G(x) O(-)
   - T, N, G are NOT in the word.
   - A is still in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5 (confirmed again).
   - O was marked “-” here, but we already know it’s correct in position 3, so this just reinforces A’s placement.

3. MOCHA → M(x) O(-) C(-) H(x) A(-)
   - M, H are NOT in the word.
   - O was marked “-” again, which again confirms O is in position 3.
   - C is in the word but NOT in position 4 (because it was marked “-”).
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 5 (confirmed again).

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ O _ _
- A must be in position 4 (because it cannot be in 1, 2, or 5).
- C is in the word but NOT in position 4 (so it must be in position 1 or 2).
- Forbidden letters so far: R, S, E, T, N, G, M, H.
- Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, K, L, P, V, W, Y, etc.
- Remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are already used).

So the pattern is: _ _ O A _
And we know C is somewhere in positions 1 or 2.

Possible candidates:
- B C O A L → “BCOAL” – not a valid word.
- C L O A C – invalid (C repeats and not a word).
- P A C O A – invalid (A repeats and P is in wrong spot).
- B A C O N – N is forbidden.
- C A P O A – invalid.
- L A C O N – N is forbidden.
- C A B O N – N is forbidden.
- C A P O T – T is forbidden.
- C A D O S – S is forbidden.
- C A V O R – R is forbidden.
- C A V O L – valid word: “CAVOL” – but not common.
- C A P O Y – invalid.
- C A D O B – invalid.
- C A P O K – invalid.
- C A P O L – invalid.
- C A P O Y – invalid.

- C A P O Y – invalid.
- C A P O K – invalid.
- C A P O X – invalid.
- C A P O Z – invalid.
- C A P O Y – invalid.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words that fit _ _ O A _ and contain C in position 1 or 2.

Valid words:
- C A B O N – N is forbidden.
- C A D O S – S is forbidden.
- C A F O N – N is forbidden.
- C A G O N – G is forbidden.
- C A H O N – H is forbidden.

- C A V O N – N is forbidden.
- C A W O N – N is forbidden.
- C A X O N – N is forbidden.
- C A Y O N – N is forbidden.

This suggests we may have made an error. Let’s re-examine the constraints.

We know:
- Pattern: _ _ O A _
- C is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from MOCHA feedback).
- C must therefore be in position 1 or 2.
- Forbidden letters: R, S, E, T, N, G, M, H.
- Remaining consonants: B, D, F, K, L, P, V, W, Y, etc.
- Remaining vowels: I, U.

Let’s try C in position 1:
- C _ O A _
Possible valid words:
- C O A L – too short.
- C O A L S – S is forbidden.
- C O A L S – invalid.
- C O A L S – invalid.
- C O A L S – invalid.
- C O A L S – invalid.
- C O A L S – invalid.
- C O A L S – invalid.
- C O A L S – invalid.
- C O A L S – invalid.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words starting with C and having O in position 3 and A in position 4:
- C H O A L – H is forbidden.
- C L O A C – invalid (C repeats).
- C L O A K – K is allowed, but is “CLOAK” valid? Yes, “CLOAK” is a word.

- C L O A K – C is in position 1 (allowed), O in 3, A in 4, K in 5 (allowed).

“CLOAK” fits all constraints:
- C is in position 1 (allowed).
- O is in position 3 (confirmed).
- A is in position 4 (confirmed).
- L and K are new letters not yet tested.
- No forbidden letters are used.
