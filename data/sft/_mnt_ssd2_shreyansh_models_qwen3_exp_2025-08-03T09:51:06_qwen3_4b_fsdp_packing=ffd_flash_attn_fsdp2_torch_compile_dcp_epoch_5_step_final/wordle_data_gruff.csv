For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use vowels and frequently appearing consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular starting choice because it contains:

- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This combination gives me good coverage of common letters and can help reveal which vowels are present and their positions.

Let’s list some candidate words that fit _ R U _ _ and avoid the excluded letters:
- B R U N ? – BRUNT is valid but “brunt” is uncommon.
- C R U C ? – CRUC? – CRUEL has E (excluded), CRUMB has M and B but B is allowed, but CRUMB is obscure.
- D R U P ? – DRUP? – DRUPAL is too long.

- G R U N ? – GRUNT is valid and common.
- L R U ? – Doesn’t fit.
- M R U ? – Doesn’t fit.
- P R U ? – Doesn’t fit.

Let’s check:
- G (new), R (confirmed), U (confirmed), N (new), T (but T is excluded! Wait – T is already ruled out by Guess 2 feedback. So GRUNT has T in position 5, which is invalid.)

Next best: “BRUNT” – B, R, U, N, T – again has T (invalid).

Next: “CRUMB” – C, R, U, M, B – all letters are allowed (none of A,O,S,E,I,T). CRUMB is a valid word (though uncommon).

Another: “DRUMS” – has S and T (invalid).

“PRUNE” – has E and T (invalid).

“CURV?” – CURVE has E, CURVY has Y but is uncommon.

“FRUIT” already used.

“GRUBS” – has S (invalid).

“CRUMB” seems the only valid candidate that fits all constraints.

But let me double-check:
- CRUMB: C, R, U, M, B – none of A,O,S,E,I,T appear. Pattern _ R U _ _ is satisfied (positions 2=R, 3=U). Valid word.

Therefore, CRUMB is the next logical guess.

Another: “DRUMS” – has S and T (invalid).

“PRUNE” – has E and T (invalid).

“CURV?” – CURVE has E, CURVY has Y but is uncommon.

“FRUIT” already used.

“GRUBS” – has S (invalid).

“CRUMB” seems the only valid candidate that fits all constraints.

But let me double-check:
- CRUMB: C, R, U, M, B – none of A,O,S,E,I,T appear. Pattern _ R U _ _ is satisfied (positions 2=R, 3=U). Valid word.

Therefore, CRUMB is the next logical guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use vowels and frequently appearing consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular starting choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This combination gives me good coverage of common letters and can help reveal which vowels are present and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(✓) – R is in the word and is the second letter (position 2).
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, O, S, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in position 2.
2. Avoids A, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U.

Let me think of words that fit _ R _ _ _ and avoid the excluded letters. One good candidate is ""FRUIT"":
- F, R, U, I, T.
- R is in position 2.
- Avoids A, O, S, E.
- Uses new letters F, U, I, T to test their presence.

Another candidate is ""BRISK"", but S is excluded. ""CRIMP"" is possible but P is less common. ""FRUIT"" seems better as it tests F, U, I, T.

I'll go with ""FRUIT"" as the next guess.

Current known facts:
1. Pattern: _ R U _ _
2. Letters already ruled out: A, O, S, E, I, T
3. Letters still in play: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the vowels we haven’t tried yet (only U is confirmed so far).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 2
- Has U in position 3
- Does NOT contain A, O, S, E, I, T

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, L, M, N, P, V, W, etc.
Possible first letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s list some candidate words that fit _ R U _ _ and avoid the excluded letters:
- B R U N ? – BRUNT is valid but “brunt” is uncommon.
- C R U C ? – CRUC? – CRUEL has E (excluded), CRUMB has M and B but B is allowed, but CRUMB is obscure.
- D R U P ? – DRUP? – DRUPAL is too long.
- F R U I ? – FRUIT has I and T (both excluded).
- G R U N ? – GRUNT is valid and common.
- L R U ? – Doesn’t fit.
- M R U ? – Doesn’t fit.
- P R U ? – Doesn’t fit.

The most common word fitting _ R U _ _ and avoiding all excluded letters is “GRUNT”.

Let’s check:
- G (new), R (confirmed), U (confirmed), N (new), T (but T is excluded! Wait – T is already ruled out by Guess 2 feedback. So GRUNT has T in position 5, which is invalid.)

Next best: “BRUNT” – B, R, U, N, T – again has T (invalid).

Next: “CRUMB” – C, R, U, M, B – all letters are allowed (none of A,O,S,E,I,T). CRUMB is a valid word (though uncommon).

Another: “DRUMS” – has S and T (invalid).

“PRUNE” – has E and T (invalid).

“CURV?” – CURVE has E, CURVY has Y but is uncommon.

“FRUIT” already used.

“GRUBS” – has S (invalid).

“CRUMB” seems the only valid candidate that fits all constraints.

But let me double-check:
- CRUMB: C, R, U, M, B – none of A,O,S,E,I,T appear. Pattern _ R U _ _ is satisfied (positions 2=R, 3=U). Valid word.

Therefore, CRUMB is the next logical guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use vowels and frequently appearing consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is a popular starting choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This combination gives me good coverage of common letters and can help reveal which vowels are present and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(✓) – R is in the word and is the second letter (position 2).
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, O, S, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in position 2.
2. Avoids A, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U.

Let me think of words that fit _ R _ _ _ and avoid the excluded letters. One good candidate is ""FRUIT"":
- F, R, U, I, T.
- R is in position 2.
- Avoids A, O, S, E.
- Uses new letters F, U, I, T to test their presence.

Another candidate is ""BRISK"", but S is excluded. ""CRIMP"" is possible but P is less common. ""FRUIT"" seems better as it tests F, U, I, T.

I'll go with ""FRUIT"" as the next guess.

Current known facts:
1. Pattern: _ R U _ _
2. Letters already ruled out: A, O, S, E, I, T
3. Letters still in play: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the vowels we haven’t tried yet (only U is confirmed so far).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 2
- Has U in position 3
- Does NOT contain A, O, S, E, I, T

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, L, M, N, P, V, W, etc.
Possible first letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s list some candidate words that fit _ R U _ _ and avoid the excluded letters:
- B R U N ? – BRUNT is valid but “brunt” is uncommon.
- C R U C ? – CRUC? – CRUEL has E (excluded), CRUMB has M and B but B is allowed, but CRUMB is obscure.
- D R U P ? – DRUP? – DRUPAL is too long.
- F R U I ? – FRUIT has I and T (both excluded).
- G R U N ? – GRUNT is valid and common.
- L R U ? – Doesn’t fit.
- M R U ? – Doesn’t fit.
- P R U ? – Doesn’t fit.

The most common word fitting _ R U _ _ and avoiding all excluded letters is “GRUNT”.

Let’s check:
- G (new), R (confirmed), U (confirmed), N (new), T (but T is excluded! Wait – T is already ruled out by Guess 2 feedback. So GRUNT has T in position 5, which is invalid.)

Next best: “BRUNT” – B, R, U, N, T – again has T (invalid).

Next: “CRUMB” – C, R, U, M, B – all letters are allowed (none of A,O,S,E,I,T). CRUMB is a valid word (though uncommon).

Another: “DRUMS” – has S and T (invalid).

“PRUNE” – has E and T (invalid).

“CURV?” – CURVE has E, CURVY has Y but is uncommon.

“FRUIT” already used.

“GRUBS” – has S (invalid).

“CRUMB” seems the only valid candidate that fits all constraints.

But let me double-check:
- CRUMB: C, R, U, M, B – none of A,O,S,E,I,T appear. Pattern _ R U _ _ is satisfied (positions 2=R, 3=U). Valid word.

Therefore, CRUMB is the next logical guess.

We now know:

- Pattern: _ R U _ _
- Letters confirmed so far: G, R, U (with G in position 1)
- Letters still excluded: A, O, S, E, I, T, C, M, B, D, N, K, V, Y

Allowed letters left for positions 4 and 5: F, H, J, L, P, Q, W, X, Z (and any repeats).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with G
2. Has R in position 2
3. Has U in position 3
4. Uses only the remaining allowed letters for positions 4 and 5.

Possible endings:
- Position 4 and 5 must be from {F, H, J, L, P, Q, W, X, Z}.

Looking for common words:
- G R U _ _  
  - GRUFF (but F is allowed, and F is allowed again) – but F is allowed once, but we can use it again unless it was excluded. Wait, F was never excluded. Let me check: the excluded letters are A, O, S, E, I, T, C, M, B, D, N, K, V, Y. F is still allowed. So GRUFF is possible, but is it valid? GRUFF is a word (meaning very angry).

Another possibility: GRUFL? No, that's not a word.

GRUFF seems to fit:
- G (✓) in position 1
- R (✓) in position 2
- U (✓) in position 3
- F (allowed) in position 4
- F (allowed) in position 5

No excluded letters are used.

Therefore, GRUFF is the logical next guess.
