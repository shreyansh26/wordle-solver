### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, L, N, etc. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains several common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and covers vowels and consonants that appear in many 5-letter words. This should give me useful information about which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- L(x) → L is not in the word at all.
- A(-) → A is in the word, but not in the 3rd position.
- T(x) → T is not in the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- The word contains the letter A, but not in position 3.
- The letters S, L, T, E are excluded.
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep A in a different position (not 3rd).
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoid S, L, T, E.

The word “CRANK” comes to mind:
- C, R, N, K are new letters.
- A is moved to position 2 (instead of 3).
- No forbidden letters (S, L, T, E) are used.

This should help narrow down possibilities by testing C, R, N, K while repositioning A.

Let's digest the new feedback on CRANK:

- A(-) – A is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (again).
- N(x) – N is NOT in the word.

So we now know:
1. Word starts with C _ _ _ _
2. It contains A and R, but A cannot be 3rd and R cannot be 2nd.
3. Letters already ruled out: S, L, T, E, N, K.
4. Remaining common letters to test: D, G, H, I, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y.

- Begins with C.
- Uses A and R in allowed positions (A not 3rd, R not 2nd).
- Uses only allowed letters.

From the feedback so far:

1. Word starts with C A R _ _
2. Letters ruled out: S, L, T, E, N, K, G, O
3. Remaining common letters: D, H, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y
4. We need two more letters to complete C A R _ _

Looking at valid 5-letter words that start with CAR and use only the allowed letters:
- CARDS – uses D and S (S is out)
- CARRY – uses Y (allowed)
- CARUM – uses U and M (both allowed)
- CARVY – not a valid word
- CARPY – not a valid word

""CARRY"" is a valid English word and fits all constraints:
- C A R R Y
- Only uses letters we haven't ruled out (Y is new, R is allowed in positions 4 and 5).
