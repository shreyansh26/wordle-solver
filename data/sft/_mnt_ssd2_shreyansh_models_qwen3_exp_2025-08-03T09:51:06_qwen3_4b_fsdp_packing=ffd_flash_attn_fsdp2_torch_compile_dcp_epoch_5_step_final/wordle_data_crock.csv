### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should ideally include several of these letters to quickly identify which ones are in the secret word.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This gives us maximum coverage of common letters to help narrow down possibilities for the secret word.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons. However, ""AROSE"" is often considered slightly better due to the inclusion of 'O' and 'E' which are very common.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it provides excellent coverage of common letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the correct position (3rd letter) (✓)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so O is not in position 3
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ R _ _ _
- It contains O somewhere other than position 3
- It does NOT contain A, S, or E
- We still have 21 letters to consider (excluding A, S, E)

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in position 3
2. Contains O somewhere (not position 3)
3. Does not contain A, S, or E

Let me brainstorm some possibilities:
- B R O W N (but O is in position 2, which is allowed)
- C R O W N
- F R O N T
- G R O W N
- P R O N T
- T R O P E (but E is excluded)
- C R O CK (but S is excluded)
- F R O N D
- C R O W D
- P R O W L

Looking at these, ""BROWN"" seems like a solid choice because:
- R is in position 3 (✓)
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- Contains no A, S, or E
- Uses common letters (B, W, N)
- Has a good vowel-consonant balance

Another good candidate is ""CROWN"":
- R in position 3 (✓)
- O in position 2 (allowed)
- No A, S, or E
- Common letters

Between these, ""CROWN"" has slightly better letter coverage (C, W, N are common), so I'll go with that.

   - O is in position 3 (but the feedback says ✓, which should mean it’s in the correct position, contradicting the earlier feedback that O is in the word but not in position 3).  
     Wait, the feedback for AROSE shows O(✓), meaning O is in the correct position (position 3).  
     But the feedback for CROWN shows O(✓) again, which would imply O is in position 3.  
     This seems consistent: O is in position 3.

Thus the word must be C R O _ _.
