For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good first guess often includes vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of frequently used letters in English words, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in the first position (✓)
- L is in the word but wrong position (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- T is in the word but wrong position (-)
- E is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
1. Word starts with S
2. It contains L and T somewhere (but not in positions 2, 4 respectively)
3. It does NOT contain A or E

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Contains L and T (but L not in position 2 and T not in position 4)
- Does not contain A or E

Possible letters left to include: R, N, I, O, U, C, etc.

Let’s think of words that fit these constraints. One possibility is ""STINT"":
- Starts with S
- Contains T and I and N
- But we already know T is in the word but not in position 4, so position 2 is possible
- Doesn’t contain A or E

However, we don’t have info on I or N yet. Another option is ""STOLE"":
- Starts with S
- Contains L and O
- But E is excluded, so this is invalid

A better choice might be ""SLITS"":
- Starts with S
- Contains L (but L is not in position 2, so positions 3 or 4 are possible)
- Contains T (but T is not in position 4, so positions 2 or 3 are possible)
- Doesn’t contain A or E

But this repeats letters (S and T), which might not be optimal. 

Another candidate is ""STROP"":
- Starts with S
- Contains T and P, R, O
- L is required, but this doesn’t have L, so invalid

Wait, we must include L and T. Let me re-evaluate.

A valid word must include S, L, T (with L not in position 2, T not in position 4). Let me list possible words:

- STILT: has S, T, I, L, T. But T appears twice, and positions 2 and 4 are both T, but T can’t be in position 4. Also, I is untested.
- STOLE: has S, T, O, L, E. But E is excluded.
- STINT: has S, T, I, N, T. T appears twice, but T can’t be in position 4. Also, I and N are untested.
- SLUMP: has S, L, U, M, P. Missing T, so invalid.
- STOUT: has S, T, O, U, T. T appears twice, but T can’t be in position 4. Also, O and U are untested.

The best so far seems ""STINT"" because it tests T in position 2 (allowed), and introduces I and N. However, T appears twice, which might not be ideal.

Another option is ""STILT"" which tests T in position 2 and L in position 3 (allowed). This seems better as it tests new letters (I) and avoids repeating T.

But let me think of other possibilities. How about ""STROP"" – no, missing L. ""STOLE"" – invalid due to E. ""STING"" – missing L. ""STUNT"" – has S, T, U, N, T. T appears twice, positions 2 and 5. T can’t be in position 4, so position 5 is allowed. This tests T in position 2 and introduces U and N.

After considering, ""STUNT"" seems a strong next guess as it:
- Starts with S
- Contains T (position 2, allowed)
- Contains L? No, it doesn’t. We must include L.

Wait, we must include L. So ""STUNT"" is invalid. Let me re-focus.

We need a word with S, L, T (with L not in position 2, T not in position 4). Possible words:
- STILT: S(1), T(2), I(3), L(4), T(5). L is in position 4 (allowed), T is in positions 2 and 5 (positions 2 and 5 are allowed since T can’t be in 4). This introduces I.
- STINT: S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). L is missing, so invalid.
- STOLE: invalid due to E.
- STROL: S(1), T(2), R(3), O(4), L(5). This has S, T, R, O, L. T is in position 2 (allowed), L is in position 5 (allowed). This introduces R and O.

""STROL"" seems valid and tests new letters R and O. However, is ""STROL"" a valid English word? It might be a surname but not common.

Another option is ""STILT"" which is a valid word (a pole used for stepping). It tests L in position 4 and T in position 2, introducing I.

Given these options, ""STILT"" seems the best as it:
- Starts with S
- Contains L (position 4, allowed)
- Contains T (positions 2 and 5, allowed)
- Introduces I as a new letter to test

Therefore, I’ll go with ""STILT"" as the next guess.
