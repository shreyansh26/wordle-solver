For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are all **not** in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains E (but not in the 5th position).
- Does **not** contain A, R, O, S.

Next guess should:
1. Include E in a different position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th).
2. Avoid A, R, O, S entirely.
3. Use other common letters to maximize information gain.

A strong candidate is “UNTIE”:
- Uses E in the 4th position (different from 5th).
- Introduces new common letters: U, N, T, I.
- Avoids all eliminated letters (A, R, O, S).

This should help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Let’s summarize what we now know:

Letters that are **not** in the word at all: A, R, O, S, T, I  
Letters that **are** in the word (but we don’t yet know their correct positions): E, U, N

The secret word contains E, U, N, and must be 5 letters long.  
We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses only letters from the remaining alphabet (no A, R, O, S, T, I).  
- Contains E, U, N in some positions (but not in the positions they occupied last time).

From Guess 1 (AROSE) we saw E was in the word but **not** in position 5.  
From Guess 2 (UNTIE) we saw E was **not** in position 4, U was in the word but **not** in position 1, and N was in the word but **not** in position 2.

So the word must:
- Have E somewhere other than position 5.  
- Have U somewhere other than position 1.  
- Have N somewhere other than position 2.

Remaining common consonants we haven’t tried: D, L, M, P, C, F, G, H, K, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: only E is confirmed so far; we haven’t tried Y as a vowel.

Let’s try to form a word that uses E, U, N plus two new letters.  
A good candidate is “NUDGE”:
- N is moved from position 2 → position 1 (allowed).  
- U is moved from position 1 → position 2 (allowed).  
- E is moved from position 4 → position 3 (allowed).  
- Adds D and G, which are new letters we haven’t tested yet.

This will test whether D and G are in the word and give us more positional clues.

Let’s extract the new information from Guess 3 (NUDGE):

- N is in the word but **not** in position 1 (-).  
- U is in the word **and in the correct position** (position 2) (✓).  
- D is **not** in the word (x).  
- G is **not** in the word (x).  
- E is in the word but **not** in position 5 (-).

So far we know:
- Letters definitely **in** the word: E, U, N  
- Letters definitely **not** in the word: A, R, O, S, T, I, D, G  
- Positional constraints:
  – U must be in position 2 (✓ from NUDGE).  
  – N must be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be 1 or 2).  
  – E must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (cannot be 5).

We already have U locked in position 2.  
We need three more letters from the remaining alphabet (avoiding A, R, O, S, T, I, D, G).  
Remaining common letters: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to form a word that:
- Has U in position 2.  
- Uses E and N in allowed positions.  
- Adds two new letters.

A good candidate is “HUNTER”:
- H, N, T, R are not yet ruled out.  
But T and R were already ruled out in Guess 1 (AROSE).  
So “HUNTER” is invalid.

Next candidate: “FUNKY” – but it lacks E, which is required.

Next: “LUNGE”:
- L, N, G, E – but G was ruled out in Guess 3.

Next: “BUNNY”:
- B, N, N, Y – but we only know one N is in the word, not two.

Next: “PENNY” – same issue.

Next: “FUNNY” – same.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are all **not** in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains E (but not in the 5th position).
- Does **not** contain A, R, O, S.

Next guess should:
1. Include E in a different position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th).
2. Avoid A, R, O, S entirely.
3. Use other common letters to maximize information gain.

A strong candidate is “UNTIE”:
- Uses E in the 4th position (different from 5th).
- Introduces new common letters: U, N, T, I.
- Avoids all eliminated letters (A, R, O, S).

This should help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Let’s summarize what we now know:

Letters that are **not** in the word at all: A, R, O, S, T, I  
Letters that **are** in the word (but we don’t yet know their correct positions): E, U, N

The secret word contains E, U, N, and must be 5 letters long.  
We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses only letters from the remaining alphabet (no A, R, O, S, T, I).  
- Contains E, U, N in some positions (but not in the positions they occupied last time).

From Guess 1 (AROSE) we saw E was in the word but **not** in position 5.  
From Guess 2 (UNTIE) we saw E was **not** in position 4, U was in the word but **not** in position 1, and N was in the word but **not** in position 2.

So the word must:
- Have E somewhere other than position 5.  
- Have U somewhere other than position 1.  
- Have N somewhere other than position 2.

Remaining common consonants we haven’t tried: D, L, M, P, C, F, G, H, K, Y, etc.  
Remaining vowels: only E is confirmed so far; we haven’t tried Y as a vowel.

Let’s try to form a word that uses E, U, N plus two new letters.  
A good candidate is “NUDGE”:
- N is moved from position 2 → position 1 (allowed).  
- U is moved from position 1 → position 2 (allowed).  
- E is moved from position 4 → position 3 (allowed).  
- Adds D and G, which are new letters we haven’t tested yet.

This will test whether D and G are in the word and give us more positional clues.

  – E is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from earlier feedback)  
  – N is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2  

So the word must be 5 letters, contain U in position 2, contain E somewhere in positions 1 or 3, and contain N somewhere not in positions 1 or 2.

Remaining consonants we haven’t tried: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: E (only one confirmed vowel so far)

Let’s build a word that fits:
- Pattern: _ U _ _ _

Another is “FUNNE” – also not valid.  
Next: “LUENE” – invalid.

“WUNE” – invalid.  
“XUNE” – invalid.  
“ZUNE” – invalid.  
“FUNNY” – has two Ns and a Y; Y is untested, but “FUNNY” is a valid word.

Check “FUNNY”:
- F: new letter  
- U: position 2 (✓)  
- N: appears in positions 3 and 4; neither is position 1 or 2, so allowed  
- N: appears in positions 3 and 4; neither is position 2, so allowed  
- Y: new letter  

This seems valid and will test F and Y while keeping U in position 2 and checking for N placement.

Remaining consonants we haven’t tried: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: E (only one confirmed vowel so far)

Let’s build a word that fits:
- Pattern: _ U _ _ _
- Must include E and N somewhere.

One candidate is “BUENE” – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Another is “FUNNE” – also not valid.  
Next: “LUENE” – invalid.  
“PUENE” – invalid.  
“CUENE” – invalid.  
“FUNE” is only 4 letters.  
“LUNE” – invalid.  
“MUNE” – invalid.  
“HUNE” – invalid.  
“YUNE” – invalid.  
“VUNE” – invalid.  
“KUNE” – invalid.  
“WUNE” – invalid.  
“XUNE” – invalid.  
“ZUNE” – invalid.  
“FUNNY” – has two Ns and a Y; Y is untested, but “FUNNY” is a valid word.

Check “FUNNY”:
- F: new letter  
- U: position 2 (✓)  
- N: appears in positions 3 and 4; neither is position 1 or 2, so allowed  
- N: appears in positions 3 and 4; neither is position 2, so allowed  
- Y: new letter  

This seems valid and will test F and Y while keeping U in position 2 and checking for N placement.

From the new feedback on FUNNY:
- F(x) – F is NOT in the word.
- U(✓) – U is in the word and is in position 2 (confirmed).
- N(-) – N is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- N(-) – N is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- Y(x) – Y is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, T, I, D, G, F, Y
- Letters that ARE in the word: U (position 2), E (somewhere in positions 1 or 3), N (must appear once, and cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 – the only remaining spot is position 5).

Therefore the word must be:
- 5 letters
- U in position 2
- E in position 1 (since it can’t be in positions 3, 4, or 5)
- N in position 5
- Two more letters in positions 3 and 4 from the remaining unused consonants: B, C, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

A valid English word that fits this pattern is “BUNNY”:
- B (new letter)
- U (position 2, ✓)
- N (position 3 – but earlier feedback said N is NOT in position 3, so this is invalid)
