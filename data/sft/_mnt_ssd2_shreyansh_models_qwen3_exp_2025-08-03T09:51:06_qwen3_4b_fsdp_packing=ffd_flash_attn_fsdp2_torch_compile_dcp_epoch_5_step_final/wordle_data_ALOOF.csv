For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters. One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, and E, which are all very common letters. This should give me good information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it uses five of the most common letters and can help narrow down the possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the correct position (first letter).
- O is in the correct position (third letter).
- R, S, and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like: A _ O _ _

Letters we can eliminate: R, S, E.

Now I need a new word that:
1. Starts with A.
2. Has O in the third position.
3. Does NOT contain R, S, or E.

I’ll think of words that fit A _ O _ _ and avoid the eliminated letters. Some candidates:
- ALOOF
- AMBIT (but has B and T, not sure)
- AFOUL
- AGING
- ADORE (but has E, which is eliminated)
- AFOOT
- AFOGS (but has S, eliminated)
- AFOUL seems valid: A-F-O-U-L
- ALOOF: A-L-O-O-F

Let me pick ALOOF because it uses common letters (L, O, F) and fits all constraints.

Check: A _ O _ _
Letters: A, L, O, O, F – no R, S, E. Good.

So next guess: ALOOF
