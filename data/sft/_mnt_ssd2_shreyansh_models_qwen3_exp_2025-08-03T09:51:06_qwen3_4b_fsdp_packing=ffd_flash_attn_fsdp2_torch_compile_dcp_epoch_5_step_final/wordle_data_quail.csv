From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must be in positions 2-5).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains an A, but not in the first position.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep the A but move it to positions 2-5.
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (T, L, N, I, C, U, etc.).
3. Avoid R, O, S, E.

A good candidate is ""TALON"":
- T (new letter)
- A (known to be in word, now in position 2)
- L (new letter)
- O (already ruled out – this is bad)
- N (new letter)

Oops, ""TALON"" has an O which is invalid. Let me pick another word.

""CANAL"":
- C (new)
- A (known, now in position 2)
- N (new)
- A (duplicate A – not ideal)
- L (new)

This has two As, which might not be helpful. Let me choose a word with one A and other new letters.

""TULIP"":
- T (new)
- U (new)
- L (new)
- I (new)
- P (new)

This tests 5 new letters and doesn't use A. But we know A is in the word, so we need to include it.

""PLANT"":
- P (new)
- L (new)
- A (known, now in position 3)
- N (new)
- T (new)

This uses A in position 3 and tests 4 new letters. This seems optimal.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses 5 of these common letters and has no repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible. A good choice is ""AROSE"" - it contains 5 of the most frequent letters and has a mix of vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must be in positions 2-5).
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains an A, but not in the first position.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep the A but move it to positions 2-5.
2. Introduce new common letters that haven’t been tested yet (T, L, N, I, C, U, etc.).
3. Avoid R, O, S, E.

A good candidate is ""TALON"":
- T (new letter)
- A (known to be in word, now in position 2)
- L (new letter)
- O (already ruled out – this is bad)
- N (new letter)

Oops, ""TALON"" has an O which is invalid. Let me pick another word.

""CANAL"":
- C (new)
- A (known, now in position 2)
- N (new)
- A (duplicate A – not ideal)
- L (new)

This has two As, which might not be helpful. Let me choose a word with one A and other new letters.

""TULIP"":
- T (new)
- U (new)
- L (new)
- I (new)
- P (new)

This tests 5 new letters and doesn't use A. But we know A is in the word, so we need to include it.

""PLANT"":
- P (new)
- L (new)
- A (known, now in position 3)
- N (new)
- T (new)

This uses A in position 3 and tests 4 new letters. This seems optimal.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ A _ _
- Letters definitely used: A, L
- Letters definitely excluded: R, O, S, E, P, N, T
- Still need to test common remaining letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y

Next guess should:
- Keep A in position 3.

   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word.

2. plant → P(x) L(-) A(✓) N(x) T(x)
   - A is in the word AND in the correct position (position 3).
   - L is in the word but not in position 2.
   - P, N, T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ A _ _
- Letters definitely used: A, L
- Letters definitely excluded: R, O, S, E, P, N, T
- Still need to test common remaining letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y

Next guess should:
- Keep A in position 3.
- Include L but move it away from position 2.
- Introduce as many new common letters as possible without reusing excluded letters.

A good candidate is ""CLADY"":
- C (new)
- L (known, now in position 1)
- A (fixed in position 3)
- D (new)
- Y (new)

This tests 4 new letters while respecting all constraints.

From the new feedback on CLADY:
- C, D, Y are NOT in the word (x).
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).

Summary of what we know so far:
1. Word pattern: _ _ A _ _
2. Letters definitely in the word: A (position 3), L (unknown position except not 2)
3. Letters definitely OUT: R, O, S, E, P, N, T, C, D, Y
4. Remaining common letters to test: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W

Next guess must:
- Keep A in position 3.
- Place L in a new position (cannot be 2, so possible positions 1,4,5).
- Introduce as many new, still-allowed letters as possible.

A good candidate is ""FLAIM"":
- F (new)
- L (known, now in position 1)
- A (fixed)
- I (new)
- M (new)

This tests 3 new letters while moving L to position 1 and keeping A locked in place.

3. Letters definitely OUT: R, O, S, E, P, N, T, C, D, Y, F, M

Remaining common letters to test: B, G, H, K, U, V, W

Next guess must:
- Keep A in position 3 and I in position 4.
- Place L somewhere else (positions 1, 5 are still open).
- Introduce new letters from the remaining pool.

A good candidate is ""BLANK"":
- B (new)
- L (known, now in position 1)

From the feedback on BLANK:
- B, N, K are NOT in the word (x).
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-) (we already knew this).
- A is confirmed in position 3 (✓).
- I is confirmed in position 4 (✓).

So far we know:
1. Word pattern: _ _ A I _
2. Letters definitely in the word: A (position 3), I (position 4), L (unknown position, cannot be 2, 3, or 4)
   - Therefore L must be in position 1 or 5.
3. Letters definitely OUT: R, O, S, E, P, N, T, C, D, Y, F, M, B, K

Remaining common letters to test: G, H, U, V, W

Next guess must:
- Keep A in position 3 and I in position 4.
- Place L in either position 1 or 5.
- Introduce new letters from the remaining pool.

Let's try:
- If L is in position 1: L _ A I _
- If L is in position 5: _ _ A I L

We need to fill the remaining blanks with new letters. Let's try L in position 1 and test G and H:

L G A I _  - but we need a 5-letter word. The last letter must be from remaining letters (G, H, U, V, W). Let's try L G A I H - but this isn't a valid word.

Instead, let's try L in position 5: _ _ A I L. We need two new letters for positions 1 and 2 from G, H, U, V, W. Let's try H and U:

H U A I L - but this isn't a valid word.

Let's try G and H: G H A I L - not valid.

Let's try G and U: G U A I L - not valid.

Let's try H and V: H V A I L - not valid.

Let's try W and G: W G A I L - not valid.

Hmm, none of these combinations seem to form valid words. Let's try L in position 1 and test G and H:

L G A I _ - need a valid word. L G A I _ - ""lgail"" isn't valid.

Let's try L in position 1 with H and U: L H A I _ - ""lhaic"" isn't valid.

Wait, let's try L in position 1 with G and V: L G A I V - ""lgai v"" isn't valid.

This is tricky. Let's think of valid 5-letter words that fit _ _ A I _ or L _ A I _ or _ _ A I L with remaining letters.

Looking at remaining letters: G, H, U, V, W.

Possible valid words:
- L U A I L - but L can't be in position 5 if it's already in position 1.
- H U A I L - not valid.
- G U A I L - not valid.
- V U A I L - not valid.
- W U A I L - not valid.

Wait, let's think of actual words. The pattern _ _ A I _ with remaining letters.

Looking at remaining letters: G, H, U, V, W.

Possible valid words:
- G H A I L - not valid.
- H G A I L - not valid.

- V H A I L - not valid.
- W H A I L - not valid.
