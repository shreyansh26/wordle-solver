### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

Common starting words often include:
- Words with multiple vowels (like ""AUDIO"", ""AROSE"")
- Words with common consonants (like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"")

After considering these options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps test vowel positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in English words

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely reveal several letters in the secret word.

- STUPT (contains P, T – but T is in 5 – invalid)
- STUPE (contains E – invalid)
- STUPT (contains P, T – but T is in 5 – invalid)

Let me think differently: S must be in 2, 3, or 4; T must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Possible positions:
- S in 2: _ S _ _ _
  - T could be 1, 3, or 4
- S in 3: _ _ S _ _
  - T could be 1 or 4
- S in 4: _ _ _ S _
  - T could be 1 or 3

Let's try S in 3, T in 1: T _ S _ _
  - Need two more letters from allowed set (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)
  - Possible: TUSHY (but H, Y allowed) – but Y is allowed
  - TUSHY: T, U, S, H, Y – all allowed, S in 3, T in 1
  - Check if TUSHY is a valid word – yes.

Another option: TUPSY (T, U, P, S, Y) – but S in 3, T in 1 – valid.

Between TUSHY and TUPSY, TUSHY seems more likely.

But let me verify: TUSHY is a valid word meaning a small pile of shavings or sawdust.

So I'll guess TUSHY.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. STINT → S(-) T(-) I(x) N(x) T(-)

   – Y is in position 5 and is correct.  
   – H is not in the word.

So the pattern we now have is:

_ U S _ Y

with the constraints:
- T must appear exactly once (since we’ve seen it in positions 2, 5, 1 and it’s not ruled out of 3 or 4).  
- T cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5, so T must be in position 4.

Therefore the word must be:

_ U S T Y

The only missing letter is the first one. It must be a consonant from the remaining allowed letters (B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z) and must form a valid English word.

Possible first letters:
- B → BUSYT (not a word)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

Common starting words often include:
- Words with multiple vowels (like ""AUDIO"", ""AROSE"")
- Words with common consonants (like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"")

After considering these options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps test vowel positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in English words

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely reveal several letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback:
- A(x), R(x), O(x), E(x) – none of these letters are in the word at all.
- S(-) – the letter S is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.

So the secret word:
- Contains an S, but not at the end.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S somewhere in positions 1-4.
- Avoids A, R, O, E.
- Uses common remaining consonants and vowels (I, U, T, N, L, etc.).

Possible candidates:
- STUNS (S in 1st, 3rd, 5th – but 5th is end, so invalid)
- SULKY (S in 1st, U, L, K, Y)
- STINT (S in 1st, T, I, N, T)
- STILT (S in 1st, T, I, L, T)
- SNIPT (S in 1st, N, I, P, T)

""STINT"" looks good: S in 1st, T, I, N, T. It avoids A, R, O, E and places S in the first position.

So far we know:
- The word contains the letter S, but not in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from STINT feedback: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 1).
- The word does NOT contain A, R, O, E, I, N.
- T is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5 (from STINT feedback: T(-) means T is in the word but not in position 2).

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known letters S and T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S somewhere (positions 2, 3, or 4).
- Uses T somewhere (positions 1, 3, 4).
- Avoids A, R, O, E, I, N.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- SULTS (but S is in 1, 4, 5 – 5 is invalid)
- STUMP (S in 1 – invalid)
- STUPE (contains E – invalid)
- STUFT (contains F, T, U – but T is in 5 – invalid)
- STUPE (contains E – invalid)
- STUPT (contains P, T – but T is in 5 – invalid)
- STUPE (contains E – invalid)
- STUPT (contains P, T – but T is in 5 – invalid)
- STUPE (contains E – invalid)
- STUPT (contains P, T – but T is in 5 – invalid)
- STUPE (contains E – invalid)
- STUPT (contains P, T – but T is in 5 – invalid)

Let me think differently: S must be in 2, 3, or 4; T must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Possible positions:
- S in 2: _ S _ _ _
  - T could be 1, 3, or 4
- S in 3: _ _ S _ _
  - T could be 1 or 4
- S in 4: _ _ _ S _
  - T could be 1 or 3

  - Need two more letters from allowed set (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)
  - Possible: TUSHY (but H, Y allowed) – but Y is allowed
  - TUSHY: T, U, S, H, Y – all allowed, S in 3, T in 1
  - Check if TUSHY is a valid word – yes.

Another option: TUPSY (T, U, P, S, Y) – but S in 3, T in 1 – valid.

Between TUSHY and TUPSY, TUSHY seems more likely.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

Common starting words often include:
- Words with multiple vowels (like ""AUDIO"", ""AROSE"")
- Words with common consonants (like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"")

After considering these options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps test vowel positions
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which appear frequently in English words

This gives us good coverage of the alphabet and will likely reveal several letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- A(x), R(x), O(x), E(x) – none of these letters are in the word at all.
- S(-) – the letter S is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.

So the secret word:
- Contains an S, but not at the end.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has S somewhere in positions 1-4.
- Avoids A, R, O, E.
- Uses common remaining consonants and vowels (I, U, T, N, L, etc.).

Possible candidates:
- STUNS (S in 1st, 3rd, 5th – but 5th is end, so invalid)
- SULKY (S in 1st, U, L, K, Y)
- STINT (S in 1st, T, I, N, T)
- STILT (S in 1st, T, I, L, T)
- SNIPT (S in 1st, N, I, P, T)

""STINT"" looks good: S in 1st, T, I, N, T. It avoids A, R, O, E and places S in the first position.

Guess 2: STINT -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) I(x) N(x) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
So far we know:
- The word contains the letter S, but not in positions 1, 4, or 5 (from STINT feedback: S(-) means S is in the word but not in position 1).
- The word does NOT contain A, R, O, E, I, N.
- T is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5 (from STINT feedback: T(-) means T is in the word but not in position 2).

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus the known letters S and T.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses S somewhere (positions 2, 3, or 4).
- Uses T somewhere (positions 1, 3, 4).
- Avoids A, R, O, E, I, N.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- SULTS (but S is in 1, 4, 5 – 5 is invalid)
- STUMP (S in 1 – invalid)
- STUPE (contains E – invalid)
- STUFT (contains F, T, U – but T is in 5 – invalid)
- STUPE (contains E – invalid)
- STUPT (contains P, T – but T is in 5 – invalid)
- STUPE (contains E – invalid)
- STUPT (contains P, T – but T is in 5 – invalid)
- STUPE (contains E – invalid)
- STUPT (contains P, T – but T is in 5 – invalid)
- STUPE (contains E – invalid)
- STUPT (contains P, T – but T is in 5 – invalid)

Let me think differently: S must be in 2, 3, or 4; T must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Possible positions:
- S in 2: _ S _ _ _
  - T could be 1, 3, or 4
- S in 3: _ _ S _ _
  - T could be 1 or 4
- S in 4: _ _ _ S _
  - T could be 1 or 3

Let's try S in 3, T in 1: T _ S _ _
  - Need two more letters from allowed set (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)
  - Possible: TUSHY (but H, Y allowed) – but Y is allowed
  - TUSHY: T, U, S, H, Y – all allowed, S in 3, T in 1
  - Check if TUSHY is a valid word – yes.

Another option: TUPSY (T, U, P, S, Y) – but S in 3, T in 1 – valid.

Between TUSHY and TUPSY, TUSHY seems more likely.

But let me verify: TUSHY is a valid word meaning a small pile of shavings or sawdust.

So I'll guess TUSHY.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: TUSHY -> FEEDBACK: T(-) U(✓) S(✓) H(x) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. STINT → S(-) T(-) I(x) N(x) T(-)  
   – S is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 4, or 5.  
   – T is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5.

3. TUSHY → T(-) U(✓) S(✓) H(x) Y(✓)  
   – T is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   – U is in position 2 and is correct.  
   – S is in position 3 and is correct.  
   – Y is in position 5 and is correct.  
   – H is not in the word.

So the pattern we now have is:

_ U S _ Y

with the constraints:
- T must appear exactly once (since we’ve seen it in positions 2, 5, 1 and it’s not ruled out of 3 or 4).  
- T cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5, so T must be in position 4.

Therefore the word must be:

_ U S T Y

The only missing letter is the first one. It must be a consonant from the remaining allowed letters (B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z) and must form a valid English word.

Possible first letters:
- B → BUSYT (not a word)  
- C → CUSTY (not a word)  
- D → DUSTY (valid word)  
- F → FUSTY (not a word)  
- G → GUSTY (valid word)

- M → MUSTY (valid word)

- V → VUSTY (not a word)  
- W → WUSTY (not a word)  

Among these, the most common and likely answer is DUSTY.
