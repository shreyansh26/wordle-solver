For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use some of these letters.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. Alternatively, ""CRANE"" or ""AROSE"" are also good options. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities quickly.

A good candidate is “TREND”:
- T (new)  
- R (must be in word, now in position 2) – but feedback said R is not in position 2, so this is invalid.  
Next: “ENTRY” – E in 1, N, T, R in 4, Y.  
R is in position 4 (allowed), E is in position 1 (allowed).

Another candidate: “PERKY” – P, E, R, K, Y.

- R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE)
- R cannot be in position 4 (from ENTRY)
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE)
- E cannot be in position 1 (from ENTRY)

So far we have:
- E must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4
- R must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z (but we want to keep it simple and common).

We need a word that:
- Contains both R and E
- Does not contain A, O, S, N, T, Y
- Places R in position 1, 3, or 5
- Places E in position 2, 3, or 4

Let’s brainstorm possible words:

1. “CREPE” – C, R, E, P, E – but P and C are new, but we already know E must appear, and we have two Es. However, we don’t know yet if the word has two Es. Also, position 5 would be E, which is allowed (only position 5 was ruled out for E in AROSE, but ENTRY had E in position 1 which was allowed). But CREPE has P and C which are new letters. This seems possible.

2. “PERCH” – P, E, R, C, H – but R is in position 3 (allowed), E is in position 2 (allowed). This uses P, E, R, C, H. All letters are new except E and R, and positions are valid. This seems good.

3. “FRESH” – F, R, E, S, H – but S is already ruled out (from AROSE), so this is invalid.

4. “BREAD” – B, R, E, A, D – but A is ruled out, so invalid.

5. “WIDER” – W, I, D, E, R – positions: E in 4 (allowed), R in 5 (allowed). Letters W, I, D are new. This seems good.

Between PERCH and WIDER, PERCH uses P, E, R, C, H – all new letters except E and R. WIDER uses W, I, D, E, R – also new letters except E and R. Both are valid.

I’ll choose PERCH as it uses more common new letters (P, C, H) compared to WIDER (W, I, D).

Check PERCH:
- Letters: P, E, R, C, H – none of A, O, S, N, T, Y
- R is in position 3 (allowed)

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the secret word:
- R (must appear at least once)
- E (must appear at least once)

Letters that are NOT in the secret word:
A, O, S, N, T, Y

Positions ruled out so far:
- R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE)
- R cannot be in position 4 (from ENTRY)
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE)
- E cannot be in position 1 (from ENTRY)

So far we have:
- E must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4
- R must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z (but we want to keep it simple and common).

We need a word that:
- Contains both R and E
- Does not contain A, O, S, N, T, Y
- Places R in position 1, 3, or 5
- Places E in position 2, 3, or 4

Let’s brainstorm possible words:

1. “CREPE” – C, R, E, P, E – but P and C are new, but we already know E must appear, and we have two Es. However, we don’t know yet if the word has two Es. Also, position 5 would be E, which is allowed (only position 5 was ruled out for E in AROSE, but ENTRY had E in position 1 which was allowed). But CREPE has P and C which are new letters. This seems possible.

2. “PERCH” – P, E, R, C, H – but R is in position 3 (allowed), E is in position 2 (allowed). This uses P, E, R, C, H. All letters are new except E and R, and positions are valid. This seems good.

3. “FRESH” – F, R, E, S, H – but S is already ruled out (from AROSE), so this is invalid.

4. “BREAD” – B, R, E, A, D – but A is ruled out, so invalid.

5. “WIDER” – W, I, D, E, R – positions: E in 4 (allowed), R in 5 (allowed). Letters W, I, D are new. This seems good.

Between PERCH and WIDER, PERCH uses P, E, R, C, H – all new letters except E and R. WIDER uses W, I, D, E, R – also new letters except E and R. Both are valid.

I’ll choose PERCH as it uses more common new letters (P, C, H) compared to WIDER (W, I, D).

Check PERCH:
- Letters: P, E, R, C, H – none of A, O, S, N, T, Y
- R is in position 3 (allowed)
- E is in position 2 (allowed)

Let's consolidate everything we now know:

Letters that must appear somewhere in the word (confirmed by “-” feedback):
- R (cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4)
- E (cannot be in positions 1, 2, 5)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
A, O, S, N, T, Y, P, C, H

Positions ruled out so far:
- R: positions 2, 3, 4
- E: positions 1, 2, 5

Therefore:
- R must be in position 1 or 5
- E must be in position 3 or 4
- Remaining letters must be chosen from the still-allowed set: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
1. Starts with R (position 1) or ends with R (position 5)
2. Has E in position 3 or 4
3. Uses only letters from the allowed set

Let’s enumerate possibilities:

Let’s verify RIVER:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use some of these letters.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. Alternatively, ""CRANE"" or ""AROSE"" are also good options. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it uses 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) → not in the word  
- R (-) → in the word, but not in position 2  
- O (x) → not in the word  
- S (x) → not in the word  
- E (-) → in the word, but not in position 5  

So we know:
Letters to keep: R and E  
Letters to avoid: A, O, S  
We need a 5-letter word that contains both R and E, does not contain A, O, S, and places R somewhere other than position 2 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Good remaining common letters to try: T, N, L, C, I, D, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that uses R and E in new positions and adds new common letters.  
A good candidate is “TREND”:
- T (new)  
- R (must be in word, now in position 2) – but feedback said R is not in position 2, so this is invalid.  
Next: “ENTRY” – E in 1, N, T, R in 4, Y.  
R is in position 4 (allowed), E is in position 1 (allowed).  
Letters used: E, N, T, R, Y – none of A, O, S.  
Looks valid.

Another candidate: “PERKY” – P, E, R, K, Y.  
R is in position 3 (allowed), E in 1 (allowed).  
But K is less common. “ENTRY” seems better.

Final choice: “ENTRY”.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are in the secret word:
- R (must appear at least once)
- E (must appear at least once)

Letters that are NOT in the secret word:
A, O, S, N, T, Y

Positions ruled out so far:
- R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE)
- R cannot be in position 4 (from ENTRY)
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE)
- E cannot be in position 1 (from ENTRY)

So far we have:
- E must appear somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4
- R must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z (but we want to keep it simple and common).

We need a word that:
- Contains both R and E
- Does not contain A, O, S, N, T, Y
- Places R in position 1, 3, or 5
- Places E in position 2, 3, or 4

Let’s brainstorm possible words:

1. “CREPE” – C, R, E, P, E – but P and C are new, but we already know E must appear, and we have two Es. However, we don’t know yet if the word has two Es. Also, position 5 would be E, which is allowed (only position 5 was ruled out for E in AROSE, but ENTRY had E in position 1 which was allowed). But CREPE has P and C which are new letters. This seems possible.

2. “PERCH” – P, E, R, C, H – but R is in position 3 (allowed), E is in position 2 (allowed). This uses P, E, R, C, H. All letters are new except E and R, and positions are valid. This seems good.

3. “FRESH” – F, R, E, S, H – but S is already ruled out (from AROSE), so this is invalid.

4. “BREAD” – B, R, E, A, D – but A is ruled out, so invalid.

5. “WIDER” – W, I, D, E, R – positions: E in 4 (allowed), R in 5 (allowed). Letters W, I, D are new. This seems good.

Between PERCH and WIDER, PERCH uses P, E, R, C, H – all new letters except E and R. WIDER uses W, I, D, E, R – also new letters except E and R. Both are valid.

I’ll choose PERCH as it uses more common new letters (P, C, H) compared to WIDER (W, I, D).

Check PERCH:
- Letters: P, E, R, C, H – none of A, O, S, N, T, Y

Let's consolidate everything we now know:

Letters that must appear somewhere in the word (confirmed by “-” feedback):
- R (cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4)
- E (cannot be in positions 1, 2, 5)

Letters that are definitely NOT in the word:
A, O, S, N, T, Y, P, C, H

Positions ruled out so far:
- R: positions 2, 3, 4
- E: positions 1, 2, 5

Therefore:
- R must be in position 1 or 5
- E must be in position 3 or 4
- Remaining letters must be chosen from the still-allowed set: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word that:
1. Starts with R (position 1) or ends with R (position 5)
2. Has E in position 3 or 4
3. Uses only letters from the allowed set

Let’s enumerate possibilities:

1. R _ E _ _  (R in 1, E in 3)
   - R I E _ _ → R I E D _ → R I E D ?  (need 5th letter)
   - R I E L _ → R I E L ?  (R I E L ? – no common words)
   - R I E N _ → R I E N ?  (R I E N ? – no)
   - R I E V _ → R I E V ?  (R I E V ? – no)
   - R I E M _ → R I E M ?  (R I E M ? – no)
   - R I E D ?  → R I E D ?  (R I E D ? – no common word ending)

2. R _ _ E _  (R in 1, E in 4)
   - R I _ E _ → R I D E ?  (R I D E ? – no)
   - R I _ E _ → R I G E ?  (R I G E ? – no)
   - R I _ E _ → R I V E ?  (R I V E ? – no)
   - R I _ E _ → R I M E ?  (R I M E ? – no)
   - R I _ E _ → R I K E ?  (R I K E ? – no)
   - R I _ E _ → R I L E ?  (R I L E ? – no)
   - R I _ E _ → R I U E ?  (R I U E ? – no)
   - R I _ E _ → R I B E ?  (R I B E ? – no)
   - R I _ E _ → R I F E ?  (R I F E ? – no)
   - R I _ E _ → R I V E ?  (R I V E ? – no)
   - R I _ E _ → R I M E ?  (R I M E ? – no)
   - R I _ E _ → R I K E ?  (R I K E ? – no)

3. _ _ _ _ R  (R in 5, E must be in 3 or 4)
   - _ _ E _ R  (E in 3)
   - _ _ _ E R  (E in 4)

   Let’s try _ _ E _ R:
   - D E E _ R → D E E ? R → D E E P R (invalid P)
   - B E E _ R → B E E ? R → B E E P R (invalid P)
   - L E E _ R → L E E ? R → L E E P R (invalid P)
   - M E E _ R → M E E ? R → M E E P R (invalid P)
   - F E E _ R → F E E ? R → F E E P R (invalid P)

   _ _ _ E R:
   - B R E E R → B R E E R (valid word, but R is in position 2 which is ruled out)
   - D R E E R → D R E E R (R in 2 – invalid)
   - F R E E R → F R E E R (R in 2 – invalid)
   - G R E E R → G R E E R (R in 2 – invalid)
   - H R E E R → H R E E R (H is allowed, but R in 2 – invalid)
   - K R E E R → K R E E R (R in 2 – invalid)
   - L R E E R → L R E E R (invalid)
   - M R E E R → M R E E R (R in 2 – invalid)
   - P R E E R → P is invalid
   - S R E E R → S is invalid
   - T R E E R → T is invalid
   - V R E E R → V is allowed, but R in 2 – invalid
   - W R E E R → W is allowed, but R in 2 – invalid
   - X R E E R → X is allowed, but R in 2 – invalid
   - Z R E E R → Z is allowed, but R in 2 – invalid

4. R _ _ _ R  (R in 1 and 5, but E must be in 3 or 4)
   - R _ E _ R → R I E D R (invalid)
   - R _ _ E R → R I _ E R → R I V E R (valid word)
     - Letters: R, I, V, E, R
     - R in 1 and 5 – allowed (positions 1 and 5 for R)
     - E in 4 – allowed
     - Letters used: R, I, V, E (all allowed)
     - This seems to fit every rule

Let’s verify RIVER:
- Contains R (positions 1 and 5) – allowed
- Contains E (position 4) – allowed
- Does NOT contain any forbidden letters (A, O, S, N, T, Y, P, C, H)
- All letters are from the allowed set
- It is a valid 5-letter English word

Therefore, RIVER is the logical next guess.
