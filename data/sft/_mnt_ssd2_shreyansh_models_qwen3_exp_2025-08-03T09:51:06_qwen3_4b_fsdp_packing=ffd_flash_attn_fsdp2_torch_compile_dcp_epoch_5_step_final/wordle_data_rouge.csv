For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Looking at common letters in English, the most frequent are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. 

A word that uses several of these common letters is ""AROSE"". It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Another good option might be ""STARE"" or ""RAISE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better balanced. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the 5th position.

So we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains R and O somewhere (but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively).
- It does NOT contain A or S.

Next guess should incorporate R and O in different positions, include E in position 5, and avoid A and S. Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, etc. Let's try ""TROPE"":
- T: new letter
- R: must be somewhere, not position 2
- O: must be somewhere, not position 3
- P: new letter
- E: confirmed in position 5

This gives us:
- T in position 1
- R in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2, so this is bad)
Oops, R can't be in position 2. Let's try ""TROPE"" again - R is in position 2, which is invalid.

Better choice: move R to position 3 or 4, and O to position 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3). Let's try ""ROUTE"":
- R in position 1
- O in position 2
- U: new vowel
- T: new consonant
- E: position 5

This satisfies:
- R not in position 2 (it's in 1)
- O not in position 3 (it's in 2)
- Ends with E
- No A or S
- Uses new letters U and T

This seems like a solid next guess.
