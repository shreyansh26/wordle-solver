### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should ideally contain several of these letters without repeating any. 

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)
- STARE (contains S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose SLATE as it covers several very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and gives good coverage across different positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x).
- L is in the word AND in the correct position (✓ at position 2).
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-).
- T is in the word but NOT in position 4 (-).
- E is NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
- The word is _ L _ _ _
- It contains A and T somewhere else (positions 1,3,4,5 but not 3 or 4 respectively)
- It does NOT contain S or E

Good letters to test next: R, O, I, N, C, U, M, P, H, D, G, Y, K, B, F, W, V, X, Z, J, Q

I want a word that:
- Keeps L in position 2
- Tests new positions for A and T
- Introduces other common letters

Possible candidates:
- CLART (but T is in position 4 which is disallowed)
- FLANK (but N and K are less common)
- GLANT (G is okay but not super common)
- BLART (B is okay)
- PLANT (P is okay, but N is less common than R or O)
- PLANT seems good: P, L, A, N, T
   - L stays in position 2 (✓)
   - A is now in position 3 (but feedback said A is not in position 3, so this would test A in position 3 which is wrong position, which is allowed since we know A is in word but wrong position)
   - T is now in position 5 (not position 4, so this tests T in a new position)
   - Adds P and N which are common letters

But actually, since A is known to be in the word but not in position 3, testing A in position 3 would still give us the - again, which is fine. However, we might want to test A in position 1, 4, or 5 next.

Alternative: FLANK
- F, L, A, N, K
   - L in position 2 (✓)
   - A in position 3 (but feedback says A is not in position 3, so this would test A in position 3 again, which is redundant)
   - T is missing

Alternative: CLAPT
- C, L, A, P, T
   - L in position 2 (✓)
   - A in position 3 (again redundant)
   - T in position 5 (good)

Alternative: PLANT
- P, L, A, N, T
   - L in position 2 (✓)
   - A in position 3 (redundant)
   - T in position 5 (good)

Alternative: ALARM
- A, L, A, R, M
   - L in position 2 (✓)
   - A in position 1 (new position)
   - A in position 3 (redundant)
   - T is missing

Alternative: CLAPT seems better as it introduces C, P, T.

But let me think of a word that:
- Keeps L in position 2
- Tests A in position 1 or 4 or 5
- Tests T in position 1, 3, or 5
- Introduces new common letters

Possible word: CLAPT
- C, L, A, P, T
   - L in position 2 (✓)
   - A in position 3 (redundant)
   - T in position 5 (good)

Alternative: FLIRT
- F, L, I, R, T
   - L in position 2 (✓)
   - I is new
   - R is new
   - T in position 5 (good)
   - A is missing

This seems better as it tests I and R which are common.

Another: CLIMB
- C, L, I, M, B
   - L in position 2 (✓)
   - I is new
   - M, B are new
   - A, T are missing

This is also good as it tests I, M, B.

Between FLIRT and CLIMB, FLIRT seems better as it tests T in position 5 which is useful.

But let me think of a word that keeps L in position 2, tests A in position 1 or 4 or 5, and tests T in position 1, 3, or 5.

Possible: ALARM
- A, L, A, R, M
   - L in position 2 (✓)
   - A in position 1 (new position)
   - A in position 3 (redundant)
   - R, M are new
   - T is missing

This is good as it tests A in position 1 and introduces R, M.

Another: ALTAR
- A, L, T, A, R
   - L in position 2 (✓)
   - A in position 1 (new)
   - T in position 3 (good)
   - A in position 4 (redundant)
   - R is new

This seems perfect:
- Keeps L in position 2
- Tests A in position 1 (new position)
- Tests T in position 3 (new position)
- Introduces R in position 5

This covers new letters and positions efficiently.
