For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should have a mix of these to quickly narrow down possibilities.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of frequently used letters to help identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly more balanced in terms of vowel coverage.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as the first guess because it efficiently tests common vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position.
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.

So we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, O, S
- Letters definitely IN the word: R, E
- Positions ruled out: R cannot be in position 2, E cannot be in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that contains both R and E, avoids A, O, S, and places R somewhere other than position 2 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Looking for common consonants we haven’t tried yet: T, N, L, C, D, etc. and vowels I, U.

A good second guess should introduce new common letters while respecting the constraints. Let’s try “UNTIE”:
- U (new vowel)
- N (new consonant)
- T (new consonant)
- I (new vowel)
- E (known to be in the word)

But E is in position 5 here, which is ruled out. So we need to move E elsewhere.

Try “TRIPE”:
- T (new consonant)
- R (known to be in the word, not in position 2 – here it’s in position 2, which is invalid)
So R cannot be in position 2, so TRIPE is invalid.

Try “CRUEL”:
- C (new consonant)
- R (in position 2 – invalid)
Invalid.

Try “TIRE” + one more letter: “TIRE” is 4 letters. Need 5.

Try “TIRE” + a consonant: “TIREN” (not a word), “TIREL” (not common).

Try “ELDER” – but E is in position 5, invalid.

Try “RENT” + one letter: “RENTS” – but S is out.

Try “INTER” – E is in position 5, invalid.

Try “CRIME”:
- C (new)
- R (position 2 – invalid)

Try “DRIER” – R in position 2, invalid.

Try “PRIER” – R in position 2, invalid.

Try “TIRE” + another letter not yet tried: “TIRE” + “L” → “TILER” (not common).

Let’s try to form words with E in position 4 and R in 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- R _ _ E _
- _ R _ E _

Common consonants left: N, L, C, D, H, etc.

Try R _ _ E _:
- R N _ E _ → RNLE? No.
- R N D E R → RNDER? Not a word.

- R U M E R → RUMER? Not a word.
- R U C E R → RUCER? Not a word.
- R U L E R → RULER! This is a valid word.

Check constraints:

2. Contains R somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 4; but 4 is E, so positions 1 or 3).
3. Avoids A, O, S, T, I, G.

Let’s try to form words with E in position 4 and R in 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- R _ _ E _
- _ R _ E _

Common consonants left: N, L, C, D, H, etc.

Try R _ _ E _:
- R N _ E _ → RNLE? No.
- R N D E R → RNDER? Not a word.
- R U N E R → RUNER? Not a word.
- R U M E R → RUMER? Not a word.
- R U C E R → RUCER? Not a word.
- R U L E R → RULER! This is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- R is in position 1 (allowed, not position 2 or 5)
- Letters used: R, U, L, E, R – none of the forbidden letters (A, O, S, T, I, G) appear.
- All letters are from remaining common letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should have a mix of these to quickly narrow down possibilities.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of frequently used letters to help identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly more balanced in terms of vowel coverage.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as the first guess because it efficiently tests common vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position.
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.

So we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, O, S
- Letters definitely IN the word: R, E
- Positions ruled out: R cannot be in position 2, E cannot be in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that contains both R and E, avoids A, O, S, and places R somewhere other than position 2 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Looking for common consonants we haven’t tried yet: T, N, L, C, D, etc. and vowels I, U.

A good second guess should introduce new common letters while respecting the constraints. Let’s try “UNTIE”:
- U (new vowel)
- N (new consonant)
- T (new consonant)
- I (new vowel)
- E (known to be in the word)

But E is in position 5 here, which is ruled out. So we need to move E elsewhere.

Try “TRIPE”:
- T (new consonant)
- R (known to be in the word, not in position 2 – here it’s in position 2, which is invalid)
So R cannot be in position 2, so TRIPE is invalid.

Try “CRUEL”:
- C (new consonant)
- R (in position 2 – invalid)
Invalid.

Try “TIRE” + one more letter: “TIRE” is 4 letters. Need 5.

Try “TIRE” + a consonant: “TIREN” (not a word), “TIREL” (not common).

Try “ELDER” – but E is in position 5, invalid.

Try “RENT” + one letter: “RENTS” – but S is out.

Try “INTER” – E is in position 5, invalid.

Try “CRIME”:
- C (new)
- R (position 2 – invalid)

Try “DRIER” – R in position 2, invalid.

Try “PRIER” – R in position 2, invalid.

Try “TIRE” + another letter not yet tried: “TIRE” + “L” → “TILER” (not common).

Try “CRIER” – R in position 2, invalid.

Try “PRIET” – not a word.

Try “TIRE” + “N” → “TIREN” – not a word.

Try “TIRE” + “D” → “TIDER” – not a word.

Try “TIRE” + “G” → “TIGER”:
- T, I, G, E, R
- E is in position 4 (valid)
- R is in position 5 (valid)
- Introduces G and T, I (new vowels)

This looks valid:
- Contains R (not in position 2) and E (not in position 5)
- Avoids A, O, S
- Common letters T, I, G

So I’ll go with “TIGER”.

From the new feedback on TIGER:

- T(x) → T is NOT in the word.
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word.
- G(x) → G is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (and we already knew it’s not in position 2 from AROSE).

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, I, G
- Letters definitely IN the word: E (position 4), R (somewhere, but not positions 2 or 5)

Remaining common letters to test: N, L, C, D, U, Y, H, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 4.
2. Contains R somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 4; but 4 is E, so positions 1 or 3).
3. Avoids A, O, S, T, I, G.

Let’s try to form words with E in position 4 and R in 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- R _ _ E _

- R N _ E _ → RNLE? No.
- R N D E R → RNDER? Not a word.
- R U N E R → RUNER? Not a word.
- R U M E R → RUMER? Not a word.
- R U C E R → RUCER? Not a word.
- R U L E R → RULER! This is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- R is in position 1 (allowed, not position 2 or 5)
- Letters used: R, U, L, E, R – none of the forbidden letters (A, O, S, T, I, G) appear.
- All letters are from remaining common letters.

So ""RULER"" seems like a good next guess.

From the latest feedback on RULER:

- R(✓) – the first R is correct in position 1.
- U(x) – U is not in the word at all.
- L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 3.
- E(✓) – the E in position 4 is correct.
- R(-) – the final R is not in position 5 (but we already know R is only in position 1).

So the word now looks like:  
R _ _ E _  
with the constraints:
- Cannot contain A, O, S, T, I, G, U
- Cannot have L in position 3
- Must contain R (already placed at 1) and E (already placed at 4)
- Remaining letters to try: common consonants like N, C, D, H, Y, etc.

We need two more letters (positions 2 and 3) from the allowed set {C, D, H, N, Y, M, F, K, B, V, W, P, etc.} and ensure L is not in position 3.

Possible combinations:
- Position 3 cannot be L, so try C, N, D, etc.
- Let’s test “R N C E R” → RN CER? Not a word.
- “R N D E R” → RNDER? No.
- “R N L E R” → R is already at 1, L not allowed at 3.
- “R N M E R” → RN MER? No.
- “R N Y E R” → RN YER? No.
- “R N C E R” – no.
- “R N D E R” – no.
- “R N B E R” – no.
- “R N F E R” – no.
- “R N V E R” – no.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should have a mix of these to quickly narrow down possibilities.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of frequently used letters to help identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly more balanced in terms of vowel coverage.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as the first guess because it efficiently tests common vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position.
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.

So we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, O, S
- Letters definitely IN the word: R, E
- Positions ruled out: R cannot be in position 2, E cannot be in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that contains both R and E, avoids A, O, S, and places R somewhere other than position 2 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Looking for common consonants we haven’t tried yet: T, N, L, C, D, etc. and vowels I, U.

A good second guess should introduce new common letters while respecting the constraints. Let’s try “UNTIE”:
- U (new vowel)
- N (new consonant)
- T (new consonant)
- I (new vowel)
- E (known to be in the word)

But E is in position 5 here, which is ruled out. So we need to move E elsewhere.

Try “TRIPE”:
- T (new consonant)
- R (known to be in the word, not in position 2 – here it’s in position 2, which is invalid)
So R cannot be in position 2, so TRIPE is invalid.

Try “CRUEL”:
- C (new consonant)
- R (in position 2 – invalid)
Invalid.

Try “TIRE” + one more letter: “TIRE” is 4 letters. Need 5.

Try “TIRE” + a consonant: “TIREN” (not a word), “TIREL” (not common).

Try “ELDER” – but E is in position 5, invalid.

Try “RENT” + one letter: “RENTS” – but S is out.

Try “INTER” – E is in position 5, invalid.

Try “CRIME”:
- C (new)
- R (position 2 – invalid)

Try “DRIER” – R in position 2, invalid.

Try “PRIER” – R in position 2, invalid.

Try “TIRE” + another letter not yet tried: “TIRE” + “L” → “TILER” (not common).

Try “CRIER” – R in position 2, invalid.

Try “PRIET” – not a word.

Try “TIRE” + “N” → “TIREN” – not a word.

Try “TIRE” + “D” → “TIDER” – not a word.

Try “TIRE” + “G” → “TIGER”:
- T, I, G, E, R
- E is in position 4 (valid)
- R is in position 5 (valid)
- Introduces G and T, I (new vowels)

This looks valid:
- Contains R (not in position 2) and E (not in position 5)
- Avoids A, O, S
- Common letters T, I, G

So I’ll go with “TIGER”.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TIGER -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on TIGER:

- T(x) → T is NOT in the word.
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word.
- G(x) → G is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (and we already knew it’s not in position 2 from AROSE).

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, I, G
- Letters definitely IN the word: E (position 4), R (somewhere, but not positions 2 or 5)

Remaining common letters to test: N, L, C, D, U, Y, H, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 4.
2. Contains R somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 4; but 4 is E, so positions 1 or 3).
3. Avoids A, O, S, T, I, G.

Let’s try to form words with E in position 4 and R in 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- R _ _ E _
- _ R _ E _

Common consonants left: N, L, C, D, H, etc.

Try R _ _ E _:
- R N _ E _ → RNLE? No.
- R N D E R → RNDER? Not a word.
- R U N E R → RUNER? Not a word.
- R U M E R → RUMER? Not a word.
- R U C E R → RUCER? Not a word.
- R U L E R → RULER! This is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- R is in position 1 (allowed, not position 2 or 5)
- Letters used: R, U, L, E, R – none of the forbidden letters (A, O, S, T, I, G) appear.
- All letters are from remaining common letters.

So ""RULER"" seems like a good next guess.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)

   - Letters in the word: R (but not in position 2), E (but not in position 5)

2. TIGER → T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(-)

   - Letters not in the word: U
   - E is confirmed in position 4
   - L is in the word but not in position 3
   - R is in the word but not in position 5 (already known)

So far we have:
- Word pattern: R _ _ E _
- Must contain L (but not in position 3)
- Must not contain: A, O, S, T, I, G, U
- Remaining common letters: N, C, D, H, M, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with R, ending with E, having L somewhere not in position 3, and using only allowed letters.

Possible positions for L:
- Position 2: R L _ E _
- Position 4: R _ L E _ → but position 4 is E, so invalid
- Position 5: R _ _ E L → but position 5 is _, and we know R is in position 1, so this is possible

Let's check:
- R L _ E _ : need a letter for position 3 that is not forbidden
  - Common letters left: N, C, D, H, M, Y
  - Possible words: R L N E Y → ""RLNEY"" (invalid)
  - R L C E D → ""RLCED"" (invalid)
  - R L D E Y → ""RLDEY"" (invalid)
  - R L H E D → ""RLHED"" (invalid)
  - R L M E D → ""RLMED"" (invalid)
  - R L N E D → ""RLNED"" (invalid)
  - R L Y E D → ""RLYED"" (invalid)

- R _ _ E L :

  - Position 2: R C _ E L → ""RCE_L"" → ""RCEL"" (invalid)
  - Position 2: R D _ E L → ""RDEL"" (invalid)
  - Position 2: R H _ E L → ""RH_E_L"" → ""RH E L"" → ""RH E L"" (invalid)
  - Position 2: R M _ E L → ""R MEL"" (invalid)
  - Position 2: R N _ E L → ""RN_E_L"" → ""RNEL"" (invalid)
  - Position 2: R Y _ E L → ""RY_E_L"" → ""RYEL"" (invalid)

Wait, let's think of actual words:
- R _ _ E L : ""REL"" is at the end, so possible words:
  - ""RELIC"" - but I is forbidden
  - ""RELAX"" - but A is forbidden
  - ""RELAY"" - but A is forbidden
  - ""RELIC"" - already excluded
  - ""RELVE"" - not a word
  - ""REVEL"" - but V is allowed, let's check:
    - R E V E L → but E is in position 4, so positions: R E V E L → E appears twice (position 2 and 4), but we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, V is allowed.
    - However, we know L must be in the word (from L(-)), so ""REVEL"" has L in position 5, which is allowed.

Check ""REVEL"":
- Letters: R, E, V, E, L
- R is in position 1 (✓)
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- L is in position 5 (allowed, since L(-) means not in position 3)
- No forbidden letters: A, O, S, T, I, G, U

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should have a mix of these to quickly narrow down possibilities.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of frequently used letters to help identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly more balanced in terms of vowel coverage.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as the first guess because it efficiently tests common vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position.
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word.
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.

So we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, O, S
- Letters definitely IN the word: R, E
- Positions ruled out: R cannot be in position 2, E cannot be in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that contains both R and E, avoids A, O, S, and places R somewhere other than position 2 and E somewhere other than position 5.

Looking for common consonants we haven’t tried yet: T, N, L, C, D, etc. and vowels I, U.

A good second guess should introduce new common letters while respecting the constraints. Let’s try “UNTIE”:
- U (new vowel)
- N (new consonant)
- T (new consonant)
- I (new vowel)
- E (known to be in the word)

But E is in position 5 here, which is ruled out. So we need to move E elsewhere.

Try “TRIPE”:
- T (new consonant)
- R (known to be in the word, not in position 2 – here it’s in position 2, which is invalid)
So R cannot be in position 2, so TRIPE is invalid.

Try “CRUEL”:
- C (new consonant)
- R (in position 2 – invalid)
Invalid.

Try “TIRE” + one more letter: “TIRE” is 4 letters. Need 5.

Try “TIRE” + a consonant: “TIREN” (not a word), “TIREL” (not common).

Try “ELDER” – but E is in position 5, invalid.

Try “RENT” + one letter: “RENTS” – but S is out.

Try “INTER” – E is in position 5, invalid.

Try “CRIME”:
- C (new)
- R (position 2 – invalid)

Try “DRIER” – R in position 2, invalid.

Try “PRIER” – R in position 2, invalid.

Try “TIRE” + another letter not yet tried: “TIRE” + “L” → “TILER” (not common).

Try “CRIER” – R in position 2, invalid.

Try “PRIET” – not a word.

Try “TIRE” + “N” → “TIREN” – not a word.

Try “TIRE” + “D” → “TIDER” – not a word.

Try “TIRE” + “G” → “TIGER”:
- T, I, G, E, R
- E is in position 4 (valid)
- R is in position 5 (valid)
- Introduces G and T, I (new vowels)

This looks valid:
- Contains R (not in position 2) and E (not in position 5)
- Avoids A, O, S
- Common letters T, I, G

So I’ll go with “TIGER”.

- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (and we already knew it’s not in position 2 from AROSE).

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, I, G
- Letters definitely IN the word: E (position 4), R (somewhere, but not positions 2 or 5)

Remaining common letters to test: N, L, C, D, U, Y, H, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 4.
2. Contains R somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 4; but 4 is E, so positions 1 or 3).
3. Avoids A, O, S, T, I, G.

Let’s try to form words with E in position 4 and R in 1 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- R _ _ E _
- _ R _ E _

Common consonants left: N, L, C, D, H, etc.

Try R _ _ E _:
- R N _ E _ → RNLE? No.
- R N D E R → RNDER? Not a word.
- R U N E R → RUNER? Not a word.
- R U M E R → RUMER? Not a word.
- R U C E R → RUCER? Not a word.
- R U L E R → RULER! This is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- R is in position 1 (allowed, not position 2 or 5)
- Letters used: R, U, L, E, R – none of the forbidden letters (A, O, S, T, I, G) appear.
- All letters are from remaining common letters.

- Position 5: R _ _ E L → but position 5 is _, and we know R is in position 1, so this is possible

Let's check:
- R L _ E _ : need a letter for position 3 that is not forbidden
  - Common letters left: N, C, D, H, M, Y
  - Possible words: R L N E Y → ""RLNEY"" (invalid)
  - R L C E D → ""RLCED"" (invalid)
  - R L D E Y → ""RLDEY"" (invalid)
  - R L H E D → ""RLHED"" (invalid)
  - R L M E D → ""RLMED"" (invalid)
  - R L N E D → ""RLNED"" (invalid)
  - R L Y E D → ""RLYED"" (invalid)

- R _ _ E L :
  - Position 2: R N _ E L → ""RN_E_L"" → ""RNCEL"" (invalid)
  - Position 2: R C _ E L → ""RCE_L"" → ""RCEL"" (invalid)
  - Position 2: R D _ E L → ""RDEL"" (invalid)
  - Position 2: R H _ E L → ""RH_E_L"" → ""RH E L"" → ""RH E L"" (invalid)
  - Position 2: R M _ E L → ""R MEL"" (invalid)
  - Position 2: R N _ E L → ""RN_E_L"" → ""RNEL"" (invalid)
  - Position 2: R Y _ E L → ""RY_E_L"" → ""RYEL"" (invalid)

Wait, let's think of actual words:
- R _ _ E L : ""REL"" is at the end, so possible words:
  - ""RELIC"" - but I is forbidden
  - ""RELAX"" - but A is forbidden
  - ""RELAY"" - but A is forbidden
  - ""RELIC"" - already excluded
  - ""RELVE"" - not a word
  - ""REVEL"" - but V is allowed, let's check:
    - R E V E L → but E is in position 4, so positions: R E V E L → E appears twice (position 2 and 4), but we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, V is allowed.
    - However, we know L must be in the word (from L(-)), so ""REVEL"" has L in position 5, which is allowed.

Check ""REVEL"":
- Letters: R, E, V, E, L
- R is in position 1 (✓)
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- L is in position 5 (allowed, since L(-) means not in position 3)
- No forbidden letters: A, O, S, T, I, G, U
- Common letters used: V is new but allowed

This seems valid.

Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should have a mix of these to quickly narrow down possibilities.\n\nLooking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage of frequently used letters to help identify which letters are in the word and their positions.\n\nAnother strong option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly more balanced in terms of vowel coverage.\n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as the first guess because it efficiently tests common vowels and consonants.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.\n- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position.\n- O(x) → O is NOT in the word.\n- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.\n- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.\n\nSo we know:\n- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, O, S\n- Letters definitely IN the word: R, E\n- Positions ruled out: R cannot be in position 2, E cannot be in position 5.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that contains both R and E, avoids A, O, S, and places R somewhere other than position 2 and E somewhere other than position 5.\n\nLooking for common consonants we haven’t tried yet: T, N, L, C, D, etc. and vowels I, U.\n\nA good second guess should introduce new common letters while respecting the constraints.

- E(✓) → E is correct in position 2
- V(x) → V is not in the word
- E(✓) → E is correct in position 4
- L(✓) → L is correct in position 5

So the pattern is now fully determined: R E _ E L

We only need to find the correct letter for position 3. The remaining letters must be from the unused alphabet excluding all previously ruled-out letters (A, O, S, T, I, G, U, V).

Allowed letters for position 3: B, C, D, F, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, W, X, Y, Z
