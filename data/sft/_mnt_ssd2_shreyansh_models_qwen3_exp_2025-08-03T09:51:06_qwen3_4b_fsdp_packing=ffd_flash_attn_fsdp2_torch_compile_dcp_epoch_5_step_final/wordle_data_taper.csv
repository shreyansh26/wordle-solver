### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should have a mix of these to quickly identify which letters are present or absent.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This combination helps test multiple common letters in one guess, increasing the chances of getting useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

From the two previous guesses we have:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)

   - R is in the word but not in position 2
   - E is in the word but not in position 3
   - A is in the word but not in position 4
   - D is absent

Current constraints:
- Word starts with T
- Must contain A, R, E somewhere in positions 2-5
- Must not contain O, S, D
- Letters already used: T (fixed in pos 1), A, R, E
- Remaining common letters to test: N, L, C, M, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- T _ _ _ _
- Contains A, R, E in positions 2-5
- Uses only remaining valid letters

Possible positions for A, R, E:
- A cannot be in position 4
- R cannot be in position 2
- E cannot be in position 3

Let's try to place them:
- Position 2: A, R, E
- Position 3: A, R, E (but E is excluded here)
- Position 4: A, R, E (but A is excluded here)
- Position 5: A, R, E

A good candidate is ""T R A E _"" but we need a valid word. Let's think of words starting with T and containing A, R, E.

Possible valid words:
- T A R E _ → ""TARGE"" (but G is untested)
- T A R E _ → ""TARES"" (but S is excluded)
- T A R E _ → ""TAROC"" (but O is excluded)
- T A R E _ → ""TAROT"" (but O is excluded)
- T A R E _ → ""TARPS"" (but S is excluded)
- T A R E _ → ""TAROT"" (invalid)

Wait, let's think differently. We need A, R, E in positions 2-5 with constraints.

Another approach: ""T A R E _"" is invalid because E would be in position 4 which is allowed, but we need a valid word. ""TARGE"" is a valid word (a type of sword), but G is untested. Let's check:
- T(✓) A(-) R(-) G(x) E(-) → but G is new
But we need to test if this fits constraints:
- A is in position 2 (originally was position 1, so allowed)
- R is in position 3 (originally was position 2, so allowed)
- E is in position 5 (originally was position 5, but feedback says E is in word but not in position 5, so this is invalid)

Next possibility: ""T A E R _"" → ""TAHER"" (invalid)
""T A E R _"" → ""TAPER"" (valid word)
Check constraints:
- T(✓) A(-) P(x) E(-) R(-) → but P is new
But positions:
- A is in position 2 (originally 1, allowed)
- E is in position 4 (originally 5, allowed)
- R is in position 5 (originally 2, allowed)
This seems valid, but let's see if it's a real word - ""TAPER"" is valid.

However, we should test new letters as much as possible. Another candidate: ""T A R E _"" → ""TARE"" needs 5 letters. ""TARES"" is invalid (S excluded).

Alternative: ""T E A R _"" → ""TEAR_"" → ""TEARS"" (S excluded)
""T E A R _"" → ""TREAD"" (already guessed)

Another candidate: ""T R A E _"" → ""TRAER"" (invalid)
""T R A _ E"" → ""TRA_E"" → ""TRAPE"" (invalid)
""T R _ A E"" → ""TRAE_"" → ""TRAPE"" (invalid)

Wait, let's think systematically. We need:
- T _ _ _ _
- Must contain A, R, E in positions 2-5
- A not in 4
- R not in 2
- E not in 3

Possible arrangements:
- T A R E _ → ""TARGE"" (G is new)
  - E is in position 4 (allowed, since E was not in position 3)
  - R is in position 3 (allowed, since R was not in position 2)
  - A is in position 2 (allowed, since A was not in position 1)
  - G is new
  - ""TARGE"" is valid

This seems to fit all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is ""TARGE"".

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should have a mix of these to quickly identify which letters are present or absent.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This combination helps test multiple common letters in one guess, increasing the chances of getting useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: O, S
- Letters definitely present: A, R, E (but each is in a different position)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, E (each in a different spot than their positions in arose)
2. Does NOT contain O or S
3. Uses only the remaining common letters (T, N, L, etc.) to test new positions

A good next guess that incorporates A, R, E in new positions and tests new letters is ""TREAD"":
- T: new letter
- R: must move from position 2 to 3 or 4 or 5
- E: must move from position 5 to 1, 2, 3, or 4
- A: must move from position 1 to 2, 3, 4, or 5
- D: new letter

This tests T and D while repositioning A, R, E.

From the two previous guesses we have:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, R, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively
   - O and S are absent

2. tread → T(✓) R(-) E(-) A(-) D(x)
   - T is correct in position 1
   - R is in the word but not in position 2
   - E is in the word but not in position 3
   - A is in the word but not in position 4
   - D is absent

Current constraints:
- Word starts with T
- Must contain A, R, E somewhere in positions 2-5
- Must not contain O, S, D
- Letters already used: T (fixed in pos 1), A, R, E
- Remaining common letters to test: N, L, C, M, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- T _ _ _ _
- Contains A, R, E in positions 2-5
- Uses only remaining valid letters

Possible positions for A, R, E:
- A cannot be in position 4
- R cannot be in position 2
- E cannot be in position 3

Let's try to place them:
- Position 2: A, R, E
- Position 3: A, R, E (but E is excluded here)
- Position 4: A, R, E (but A is excluded here)
- Position 5: A, R, E

A good candidate is ""T R A E _"" but we need a valid word. Let's think of words starting with T and containing A, R, E.

Possible valid words:
- T A R E _ → ""TARGE"" (but G is untested)
- T A R E _ → ""TARES"" (but S is excluded)
- T A R E _ → ""TAROC"" (but O is excluded)
- T A R E _ → ""TAROT"" (but O is excluded)
- T A R E _ → ""TARPS"" (but S is excluded)
- T A R E _ → ""TAROT"" (invalid)

Wait, let's think differently. We need A, R, E in positions 2-5 with constraints.

Another approach: ""T A R E _"" is invalid because E would be in position 4 which is allowed, but we need a valid word. ""TARGE"" is a valid word (a type of sword), but G is untested. Let's check:
- T(✓) A(-) R(-) G(x) E(-) → but G is new
But we need to test if this fits constraints:
- A is in position 2 (originally was position 1, so allowed)
- R is in position 3 (originally was position 2, so allowed)
- E is in position 5 (originally was position 5, but feedback says E is in word but not in position 5, so this is invalid)

Next possibility: ""T A E R _"" → ""TAHER"" (invalid)
""T A E R _"" → ""TAPER"" (valid word)
Check constraints:
- T(✓) A(-) P(x) E(-) R(-) → but P is new
But positions:
- A is in position 2 (originally 1, allowed)
- E is in position 4 (originally 5, allowed)
- R is in position 5 (originally 2, allowed)
This seems valid, but let's see if it's a real word - ""TAPER"" is valid.

However, we should test new letters as much as possible. Another candidate: ""T A R E _"" → ""TARE"" needs 5 letters. ""TARES"" is invalid (S excluded).

Alternative: ""T E A R _"" → ""TEAR_"" → ""TEARS"" (S excluded)
""T E A R _"" → ""TREAD"" (already guessed)

Another candidate: ""T R A E _"" → ""TRAER"" (invalid)
""T R A _ E"" → ""TRA_E"" → ""TRAPE"" (invalid)
""T R _ A E"" → ""TRAE_"" → ""TRAPE"" (invalid)

Wait, let's think systematically. We need:
- T _ _ _ _
- Must contain A, R, E in positions 2-5
- A not in 4
- R not in 2
- E not in 3

Possible arrangements:
- T A R E _ → ""TARGE"" (G is new)
  - E is in position 4 (allowed, since E was not in position 3)
  - R is in position 3 (allowed, since R was not in position 2)
  - A is in position 2 (allowed, since A was not in position 1)
  - G is new
  - ""TARGE"" is valid

This seems to fit all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is ""TARGE"".

From the three guesses we now have:

   - T correct in 1
   - A correct in 2
   - R in word but not in position 3
   - E in word but not in position 5
   - G absent

Current constraints:
- Word starts with T A
- Must contain R and E in positions 3-5 (since A is fixed in 2 and T in 1)
- R cannot be in position 2 or 3 → so R must be in 4 or 5
- E cannot be in 3 or 5 → so E must be in 4 (but then R would have to be in 5)
- Check if this leads to a valid word: T A _ _ _
   - If E is in 4, R must be in 5: T A _ E R
   - But we need to place R in 5 and E in 4, but we also need to include R and E in the word. This seems to fit:
     - T A _ E R
     - The missing letter (position 3) must be a new letter not yet tested (not O, S, D, G)
     - Common letters left: N, L, C, M, etc.
     - Possible words: T A N E R → ""TANER"" (valid surname)
     - T A L E R → ""TALER"" (valid word for German silver coin)
     - T A C E R → ""TACER"" (valid word)
     - T A M E R → ""TAMER"" (valid word)

Among these, ""TAMER"" is the most common and likely. Let's verify:
- T(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(-) R(-) → but we know E must be in position 4 and R in 5, so:
   - T A M E R
   - Check positions:
     - T(1) ✓
     - A(2) ✓
     - M is new
     - E(4) must be in word but not in 3 or 5 → fits (E in 4)
     - R(5) must be in word but not in 2 or 3 → fits (R in 5)

This satisfies all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should have a mix of these to quickly identify which letters are present or absent.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This combination helps test multiple common letters in one guess, increasing the chances of getting useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

   - A, R, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5
   - O, S absent

2. tread → T(✓) R(-) E(-) A(-) D(x)
   - T is correct in position 1
   - R is in word but not in position 2
   - E is in word but not in position 3
   - A is in word but not in position 4
   - D absent

3. targe → T(✓) A(✓) R(-) G(x) E(-)
   - T correct in 1
   - A correct in 2
   - R in word but not in position 3
   - E in word but not in position 5
   - G absent

Current constraints:
- Word starts with T A
- Must contain R and E in positions 3-5 (since A is fixed in 2 and T in 1)
- R cannot be in position 2 or 3 → so R must be in 4 or 5
- E cannot be in 3 or 5 → so E must be in 4 (but then R would have to be in 5)
- Check if this leads to a valid word: T A _ _ _
   - If E is in 4, R must be in 5: T A _ E R
   - But we need to place R in 5 and E in 4, but we also need to include R and E in the word. This seems to fit:
     - T A _ E R
     - The missing letter (position 3) must be a new letter not yet tested (not O, S, D, G)
     - Common letters left: N, L, C, M, etc.
     - Possible words: T A N E R → ""TANER"" (valid surname)
     - T A L E R → ""TALER"" (valid word for German silver coin)
     - T A C E R → ""TACER"" (valid word)
     - T A M E R → ""TAMER"" (valid word)

Among these, ""TAMER"" is the most common and likely. Let's verify:
- T(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(-) R(-) → but we know E must be in position 4 and R in 5, so:
   - T A M E R
   - Check positions:
     - T(1) ✓
     - A(2) ✓
     - M is new
     - E(4) must be in word but not in 3 or 5 → fits (E in 4)
     - R(5) must be in word but not in 2 or 3 → fits (R in 5)

This satisfies all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should have a mix of these to quickly identify which letters are present or absent.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This combination helps test multiple common letters in one guess, increasing the chances of getting useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: O, S
- Letters definitely present: A, R, E (but each is in a different position)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, R, E (each in a different spot than their positions in arose)
2. Does NOT contain O or S
3. Uses only the remaining common letters (T, N, L, etc.) to test new positions

A good next guess that incorporates A, R, E in new positions and tests new letters is ""TREAD"":
- T: new letter
- R: must move from position 2 to 3 or 4 or 5
- E: must move from position 5 to 1, 2, 3, or 4
- A: must move from position 1 to 2, 3, 4, or 5
- D: new letter

This tests T and D while repositioning A, R, E.

From the two previous guesses we have:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, R, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively
   - O and S are absent

2. tread → T(✓) R(-) E(-) A(-) D(x)
   - T is correct in position 1
   - R is in the word but not in position 2
   - E is in the word but not in position 3
   - A is in the word but not in position 4
   - D is absent

Current constraints:
- Word starts with T
- Must contain A, R, E somewhere in positions 2-5
- Must not contain O, S, D
- Letters already used: T (fixed in pos 1), A, R, E
- Remaining common letters to test: N, L, C, M, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- T _ _ _ _
- Contains A, R, E in positions 2-5
- Uses only remaining valid letters

Possible positions for A, R, E:
- A cannot be in position 4
- R cannot be in position 2
- E cannot be in position 3

Let's try to place them:
- Position 2: A, R, E
- Position 3: A, R, E (but E is excluded here)
- Position 4: A, R, E (but A is excluded here)
- Position 5: A, R, E

A good candidate is ""T R A E _"" but we need a valid word. Let's think of words starting with T and containing A, R, E.

Possible valid words:
- T A R E _ → ""TARGE"" (but G is untested)
- T A R E _ → ""TARES"" (but S is excluded)
- T A R E _ → ""TAROC"" (but O is excluded)
- T A R E _ → ""TAROT"" (but O is excluded)
- T A R E _ → ""TARPS"" (but S is excluded)
- T A R E _ → ""TAROT"" (invalid)

Wait, let's think differently. We need A, R, E in positions 2-5 with constraints.

Another approach: ""T A R E _"" is invalid because E would be in position 4 which is allowed, but we need a valid word. ""TARGE"" is a valid word (a type of sword), but G is untested. Let's check:
- T(✓) A(-) R(-) G(x) E(-) → but G is new
But we need to test if this fits constraints:
- A is in position 2 (originally was position 1, so allowed)
- R is in position 3 (originally was position 2, so allowed)
- E is in position 5 (originally was position 5, but feedback says E is in word but not in position 5, so this is invalid)

Next possibility: ""T A E R _"" → ""TAHER"" (invalid)
""T A E R _"" → ""TAPER"" (valid word)
Check constraints:
- T(✓) A(-) P(x) E(-) R(-) → but P is new
But positions:
- A is in position 2 (originally 1, allowed)
- E is in position 4 (originally 5, allowed)
- R is in position 5 (originally 2, allowed)
This seems valid, but let's see if it's a real word - ""TAPER"" is valid.

However, we should test new letters as much as possible. Another candidate: ""T A R E _"" → ""TARE"" needs 5 letters. ""TARES"" is invalid (S excluded).

Alternative: ""T E A R _"" → ""TEAR_"" → ""TEARS"" (S excluded)
""T E A R _"" → ""TREAD"" (already guessed)

Another candidate: ""T R A E _"" → ""TRAER"" (invalid)
""T R A _ E"" → ""TRA_E"" → ""TRAPE"" (invalid)
""T R _ A E"" → ""TRAE_"" → ""TRAPE"" (invalid)

Wait, let's think systematically. We need:
- T _ _ _ _
- Must contain A, R, E in positions 2-5
- A not in 4
- R not in 2
- E not in 3

Possible arrangements:
- T A R E _ → ""TARGE"" (G is new)
  - E is in position 4 (allowed, since E was not in position 3)
  - R is in position 3 (allowed, since R was not in position 2)
  - A is in position 2 (allowed, since A was not in position 1)
  - G is new
  - ""TARGE"" is valid

This seems to fit all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is ""TARGE"".

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, R, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5
   - O, S absent

2. tread → T(✓) R(-) E(-) A(-) D(x)
   - T is correct in position 1
   - R is in word but not in position 2
   - E is in word but not in position 3
   - A is in word but not in position 4

3. targe → T(✓) A(✓) R(-) G(x) E(-)
   - T correct in 1
   - A correct in 2
   - R in word but not in position 3
   - E in word but not in position 5
   - G absent

Current constraints:
- Word starts with T A
- Must contain R and E in positions 3-5 (since A is fixed in 2 and T in 1)
- R cannot be in position 2 or 3 → so R must be in 4 or 5
- E cannot be in 3 or 5 → so E must be in 4 (but then R would have to be in 5)
- Check if this leads to a valid word: T A _ _ _
   - If E is in 4, R must be in 5: T A _ E R
   - But we need to place R in 5 and E in 4, but we also need to include R and E in the word. This seems to fit:
     - T A _ E R
     - The missing letter (position 3) must be a new letter not yet tested (not O, S, D, G)
     - Common letters left: N, L, C, M, etc.
     - Possible words: T A N E R → ""TANER"" (valid surname)
     - T A L E R → ""TALER"" (valid word for German silver coin)
     - T A C E R → ""TACER"" (valid word)
     - T A M E R → ""TAMER"" (valid word)

Among these, ""TAMER"" is the most common and likely. Let's verify:
- T(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(-) R(-) → but we know E must be in position 4 and R in 5, so:
   - T A M E R
   - Check positions:
     - T(1) ✓
     - A(2) ✓
     - M is new
     - E(4) must be in word but not in 3 or 5 → fits (E in 4)
     - R(5) must be in word but not in 2 or 3 → fits (R in 5)

This satisfies all constraints.

From the feedback so far:

- Guess 4 (T A M E R) gave T(✓) A(✓) M(x) E(✓) R(✓)

This tells us:
1. T is correct in position 1
2. A is correct in position 2
3. E is correct in position 4
4. R is correct in position 5
5. M is not in the word at all

So the word pattern is:
T A _ E R

We just need to determine the single missing letter in position 3.  
Letters already ruled out: O, S, D, G, M  
Letters not yet tested for position 3: B, C, F, H, I, J, K, L, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common letters in position 3 that would make a valid word:
- T A C E R → ""TACER"" (valid, though less common)
- T A L E R → ""TALER"" (valid, refers to German silver coin)
- T A N E R → ""TANER"" (valid surname)
- T A P E R → ""TAPER"" (already guessed in Guess 2, but we can guess it again since we're only testing position 3)

Among these, ""TAPER"" was already used (Guess 2), so we'll try ""TALER"" next.

From all feedback we now know the exact pattern:

T A _ E R

with the only unknown letter in position 3.  
Letters already ruled out for that spot: R (already in 5), L (Guess 5), M (Guess 3), D (Guess 2), G (Guess 3), S (Guess 1), O (Guess 1).

Letters still possible: B, C, F, H, I, J, K, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The only common English word that fits T A _ E R is **TAPER**.  
We already tried TAPER in Guess 2 and it failed at position 3 (A(-) in Guess 2), but that doesn’t eliminate C from being the correct letter—it just means we need to re-check.

Since every other letter has been eliminated, the only remaining candidate is C.
