For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word should have:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage of the alphabet.

2. The letters A, R, I, S are excluded.
3. We need 4 more letters that are NOT A, R, I, S.

- E somewhere in positions 1-4
- No A, R, I, S
- Common letters to maximize information

So far we know:
1. Word starts with T.
2. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, I, S, O, F, N, U, B, D.
3. Letters that MUST appear: E (somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5).
4. Remaining allowed letters: C, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the vowel E.

We need a 5-letter word beginning with T that contains E and uses only the allowed letters.  
Possible patterns: T _ E _ _ or T _ _ E _ (but E can’t be in position 4, so positions 2, 3, or 5).

Candidate words:
- TWEET: uses T, W, E, E, T → double E and T, but we already have T in position 1 and can’t have another T (no info says T can’t repeat).

- TWEAK: A is forbidden.  
- TWEET seems the only valid one left with E in position 2 and T in 1 and 5.

But we need to check if T can repeat. Since no feedback has ruled out repeated letters, TWEET is possible.

However, let’s look for a word with E in position 3: T _ E _ _.  
Possible: TWEET (E in 2 and 3), TEMPT (E in 3), TWEET again.

TEMPT uses T, E, M, P, T.  
- T in position 1 (✓).  
- E in position 3 (allowed).  
- M, P are allowed.  
- No forbidden letters appear.

This seems the cleanest choice.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word should have:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage of the alphabet.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A, R, I, S are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
1. The word contains E, but NOT in the last position (position 5).
2. The letters A, R, I, S are excluded.
3. We need 4 more letters that are NOT A, R, I, S.

Good consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Good vowels left: O, U (since A, I are out and E is already in)

We need a word with:
- E somewhere in positions 1-4
- No A, R, I, S
- Common letters to maximize information

Let's try ""UNTIE"":
- U, N, T, I, E
- But I is excluded, so this is bad.

Try ""OUTER"":
- O, U, T, E, R
- R is excluded, so this is bad.

Try ""OCEAN"":
- O, C, E, A, N
- A is excluded.

Try ""OFTEN"":
- O, F, T, E, N
- Contains E (position 4), no A, R, I, S, and uses common letters.

This seems good:
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- Letters: O, F, T, E, N (none of A, R, I, S)

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

   - T (must appear somewhere in positions 1–2 or 4–5, because it got “-” in position 3).

3. We still need two more distinct letters that are not in the forbidden list above.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: U (only vowel left besides E).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both E and T.  
- Uses only the allowed letters.  
- Places E and T in positions not yet ruled out.

Candidate words:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word should have:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- ARISE (A, R, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll choose ""ARISE"" as it contains 3 vowels (A, I, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), giving us good coverage of the alphabet.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ARISE:
- A, R, I, S are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
1. The word contains E, but NOT in the last position (position 5).
2. The letters A, R, I, S are excluded.
3. We need 4 more letters that are NOT A, R, I, S.

Good consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
Good vowels left: O, U (since A, I are out and E is already in)

We need a word with:
- E somewhere in positions 1-4
- No A, R, I, S
- Common letters to maximize information

Let's try ""UNTIE"":
- U, N, T, I, E
- But I is excluded, so this is bad.

Try ""OUTER"":
- O, U, T, E, R
- R is excluded, so this is bad.

Try ""OCEAN"":
- O, C, E, A, N
- A is excluded.

Try ""OFTEN"":
- O, F, T, E, N
- Contains E (position 4), no A, R, I, S, and uses common letters.

This seems good:
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- Letters: O, F, T, E, N (none of A, R, I, S)

Guess 2: OFTEN -> FEEDBACK: O(x) F(x) T(-) E(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, I, S, O, F, N  
   (because each received an “x”).

2. Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong positions so far):  
   - E (must appear somewhere in positions 1–3 or 4, because it got “-” in positions 4 and 5).  
   - T (must appear somewhere in positions 1–2 or 4–5, because it got “-” in position 3).

3. We still need two more distinct letters that are not in the forbidden list above.

Good remaining consonants: B, C, D, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Good remaining vowels: U (only vowel left besides E).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both E and T.  
- Uses only the allowed letters.  
- Places E and T in positions not yet ruled out.

Candidate words:
- BUILT: uses B, U, I, L, T → I is forbidden.  
- TUGED: uses T, U, G, E, D → but D is allowed, and positions of E and T are still open.  
- BUTLE: but this is not a valid English word.  
- PULTE: not valid.  
- TUBED: valid word.  
- TUBED uses T, U, B, E, D.  
  - E is in position 4 (allowed).  
  - T is in position 1 (allowed).  
  - No forbidden letters appear.

Let’s choose TUBED.

Guess 3: TUBED -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) U(x) B(x) E(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on TUBED:

- T is now confirmed in position 1 (✓).
- U, B, D are NOT in the word (x).
- E is still in the word but is NOT in position 4 (since it received “-” again).

So far we know:
1. Word starts with T.
2. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, I, S, O, F, N, U, B, D.
3. Letters that MUST appear: E (somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5).
4. Remaining allowed letters: C, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the vowel E.

We need a 5-letter word beginning with T that contains E and uses only the allowed letters.  
Possible patterns: T _ E _ _ or T _ _ E _ (but E can’t be in position 4, so positions 2, 3, or 5).

Candidate words:
- TWEET: uses T, W, E, E, T → double E and T, but we already have T in position 1 and can’t have another T (no info says T can’t repeat).  
- TWICE: uses T, W, I, C, E → I is forbidden.  
- TIGER: I, G, E, R → I and R forbidden.  
- TOWER: O, W, E, R → O and R forbidden.  
- TEMPT: uses T, E, M, P, T → T repeats, but no rule against it.  
- TEEPE: not a valid word.  
- TWEET: valid, but double E and T.  
- TWEED: D is forbidden.  
- TWEAK: A is forbidden.  
- TWEET seems the only valid one left with E in position 2 and T in 1 and 5.

But we need to check if T can repeat. Since no feedback has ruled out repeated letters, TWEET is possible.

However, let’s look for a word with E in position 3: T _ E _ _.  
Possible: TWEET (E in 2 and 3), TEMPT (E in 3), TWEET again.

TEMPT uses T, E, M, P, T.  
- T in position 1 (✓).  
- E in position 3 (allowed).  
- M, P are allowed.  
- No forbidden letters appear.

This seems the cleanest choice.

From the feedback on TELLY:

- T is confirmed in position 1 (✓).
- E is confirmed in position 2 (✓).
- L and Y are NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:

2. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, I, S, O, F, N, U, B, D, M, P, L, Y.
3. Remaining allowed letters: C, G, H, J, K, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word beginning with TE followed by three letters chosen from {C, G, H, J, K, V, W, X, Z} and containing no repeats of any forbidden letters.
