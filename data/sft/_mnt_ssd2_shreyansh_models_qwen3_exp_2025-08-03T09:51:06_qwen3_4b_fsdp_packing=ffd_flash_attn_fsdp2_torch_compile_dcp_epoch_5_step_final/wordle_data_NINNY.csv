### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

The feedback from AROSE tells me that none of the letters A, R, O, S, E are in the secret word at all.  
That eliminates all vowels except Y (since A, E, O are gone) and leaves consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.

I need a new word that uses letters not in AROSE.  
A good second guess should introduce a fresh set of common consonants and maybe Y.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback from AROSE tells me that none of the letters A, R, O, S, E are in the secret word at all.  
That eliminates all vowels except Y (since A, E, O are gone) and leaves consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.

I need a new word that uses letters not in AROSE.  
A good second guess should introduce a fresh set of common consonants and maybe Y.  
""UNTIL"" uses U (vowel), N, T, I, L — but I is still untested.  
Another option is ""BLUNT"" with B, L, U, N, T.  
""CLIMB"" uses C, L, I, M, B.  
""PLUMB"" uses P, L, U, M, B.  
I'll go with ""BLUNT"" because it covers common consonants B, L, N, T and the vowel U.

From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   → Eliminates: A, R, O, S, E

2. BLUNT → B(x) L(x) U(x) N(✓) T(x)  
   → Eliminates: B, L, U, T  
   → Confirms: N is in the word and is in the 4th position.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, B, L, U, T
- N is in the word and is the 4th letter (position 4).
- Remaining letters to test: C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

I need a word that:
- Has N in the 4th position.
- Uses only letters from the remaining set.
- Introduces new common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “CHINK”:
- C, H, I, N, K — all unused so far.
- N is in position 4, satisfying the known constraint.
- Uses common letters C, H, I, K to test multiple new consonants and a vowel.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback from AROSE tells me that none of the letters A, R, O, S, E are in the secret word at all.  
That eliminates all vowels except Y (since A, E, O are gone) and leaves consonants like B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z.

I need a new word that uses letters not in AROSE.  
A good second guess should introduce a fresh set of common consonants and maybe Y.  
""UNTIL"" uses U (vowel), N, T, I, L — but I is still untested.  
Another option is ""BLUNT"" with B, L, U, N, T.  
""CLIMB"" uses C, L, I, M, B.  
""PLUMB"" uses P, L, U, M, B.  
I'll go with ""BLUNT"" because it covers common consonants B, L, N, T and the vowel U.

From the two guesses we have:

   → Eliminates: B, L, U, T  
   → Confirms: N is in the word and is in the 4th position.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, B, L, U, T
- N is in the word and is the 4th letter (position 4).
- Remaining letters to test: C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

I need a word that:
- Has N in the 4th position.

- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, E, B, L, U, T, C, H, K
- N is in the word and is the 4th letter (position 4)
- I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (from CHINK feedback: I(-))

Remaining letters: D, F, G, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the confirmed N and the unknown I (but not in position 3).

We need a 5-letter word with:
- N fixed in position 4
- I somewhere else (positions 1, 2, or 5)
- Only letters from the remaining set

Possible patterns:
- I _ N _ _
- _ I N _ _
- _ _ N I _

Let's try to pick a word that fits these patterns and uses new letters. A good candidate is ""PINKY"":
- P, I, N, K, Y
But K is already eliminated, so this won't work.

Next candidate: ""DINGY"":
- D, I, N, G, Y
All letters are still available. N is in position 4, I is in position 2 (not 3, so it fits), and we test D, G, Y.

This seems like a solid guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: BLUNT -> FEEDBACK: B(x) L(x) U(x) N(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: CHINK -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(-) N(✓) K(x)
Guess 4: DINGY -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x) Y(✓)

From all the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   Eliminates: A, R, O, S, E

2. BLUNT → B(x) L(x) U(x) N(✓) T(x)  
   Eliminates: B, L, U, T  
   Confirms: N is in position 4

3. CHINK → C(x) H(x) I(-) N(✓) K(x)  
   Eliminates: C, H, K  
   Confirms: I is in the word but NOT in position 3

4. DINGY → D(x) I(✓) N(✓) G(x) Y(✓)  
   Eliminates: D, G  
   Confirms: I is in position 2, N is in position 4, Y is in position 5

So the pattern is now:
- Position 1: unknown (must be from remaining letters)
- Position 2: I (confirmed)
- Position 3: unknown (must be from remaining letters)
- Position 4: N (confirmed)
- Position 5: Y (confirmed)

Remaining letters not yet eliminated: F, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and any others not listed above)

We need a 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ I _ N Y.  
Common consonants left: F, J, M, P, V, W

Looking for valid words:
- F I _ N Y → ""FINNY"" (but double N might not fit)
- J I _ N Y → no common word
- M I _ N Y → ""MINNY"" (not common)
- P I _ N Y → ""PINGY"" (not a word)
- V I _ N Y → ""VINGY"" (not a word)
- W I _ N Y → ""WINGY"" (valid word)

""WINGY"" fits the pattern W I _ N Y and uses only confirmed letters.

Let's verify:
- W: not eliminated
- I: confirmed in position 2
- N: confirmed in position 4
- Y: confirmed in position 5

This seems correct.

From all feedback:

- Pattern is now: _ I _ N Y  
  (I is position 2, N is 4, Y is 5)

- Eliminated letters so far:  
  A, R, O, S, E, B, L, U, T, C, H, K, D, G, W

- Still-valid letters (not yet ruled out):  
  F, J, M, P, Q, V, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that fits _ I _ N Y using only those letters in the blanks.

Valid dictionary words:
- FINNY  (F and second N are allowed; double N is fine)  
- MINNY (not common)  
- PINGY (G already eliminated)  
- VINGY (G eliminated)  
- JINNY (valid variant spelling)  
- ZINNY (valid, but less common)

The most common and dictionary-valid word left is “FINNY”.

Check letters: F, I, N, N, Y  
All letters are still allowed (F, N, Y not yet eliminated).

Therefore, FINNY is the logical next guess.
