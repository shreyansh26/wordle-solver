### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a good choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present and their possible positions.

So far we have:

Letters known to be in the word but in unknown positions: T, E, R  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, L, A, N, D  

That leaves us with a set of 17 remaining letters (all others) to work with.  
We need a 5-letter word that uses T, E, R plus two more letters from the remaining pool, and must avoid S, L, A, N, D.

A good next guess should:
1. Include T, E, R (since we know they’re in the word).
2. Place them in new positions to narrow down their correct spots.
3. Introduce two new, common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Common unused letters: I, O, U, C, M, P, H, etc.

Let’s try “REACT”:
- R in position 1 (new)
- E in position 2 (new)
- A is already ruled out (x in SLATE), so REACT is invalid.

Next option: “THREW”:
- T, H, R, E, W
- H and W are new, and positions are different from before.

Check positions:
- T was in position 1 in TREND → now position 1 again. Not ideal, but acceptable.
- E was in position 3 in TREND → now position 4. New position.
- R was in position 2 in TREND → now position 3. New position.

This seems better because it moves E and R to new positions while keeping T in a new spot.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a good choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains T and E, but they are not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain S, L, or A.

Next guess should:
- Include T and E (but not in positions 4 and 5)
- Avoid S, L, A
- Use other common letters to maximize information

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

A good word could be ""TREND"":
- T in position 1 (not 4, so possible)
- E in position 2 (not 5, so possible)
- R, N, D are new letters to test
- Avoids S, L, A

So far we have:

Letters known to be in the word but in unknown positions: T, E, R  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, L, A, N, D  

That leaves us with a set of 17 remaining letters (all others) to work with.  
We need a 5-letter word that uses T, E, R plus two more letters from the remaining pool, and must avoid S, L, A, N, D.

A good next guess should:
1. Include T, E, R (since we know they’re in the word).
2. Place them in new positions to narrow down their correct spots.
3. Introduce two new, common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Common unused letters: I, O, U, C, M, P, H, etc.

Let’s try “REACT”:
- R in position 1 (new)
- E in position 2 (new)
- A is already ruled out (x in SLATE), so REACT is invalid.

Next option: “THREW”:
- T, H, R, E, W
- H and W are new, and positions are different from before.

Check positions:
- T was in position 1 in TREND → now position 1 again. Not ideal, but acceptable.
- E was in position 3 in TREND → now position 4. New position.
- R was in position 2 in TREND → now position 3. New position.

This seems better because it moves E and R to new positions while keeping T in a new spot.

From the new feedback on BRITE:

- B is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- I is NOT in the word (x)
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

Wait, this contradicts earlier feedback where E was confirmed at position 4 (✓). The feedback here shows E(-), which implies E is in the word but not at position 5. But we already know E is correctly at position 4. This suggests the feedback might be indicating that E is in the word but not at position 5, which is consistent because E is at position 4. However, the previous feedback on THREW already had E(✓) at position 4, so this new feedback should not override that. It seems the feedback is indicating that E is in the word but not at position 5, which is redundant since we know it's at 4.

Reconciling the feedback:
- From THREW: E(✓) at position 4 (fixed)
- From BRITE: E(-) means E is not at position 5 (consistent, since it's at 4)

So the key new information is:
- B and I are NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not at position 2 (-)
- T is in the word but not at position 4 (-)

Letters known to be in the word: T, R, E (with E fixed at position 4)
Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, L, A, N, D, H, W, B, I

Remaining letters: C, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word with:
- E at position 4
- T and R somewhere in positions 1,2,3, or 5
- Only using the allowed letters

Possible positions for T and R:
- T can be at 1,2,3, or 5
- R can be at 1,2,3, or 5 (but not 2 from BRITE feedback)

Let's try to form words:
- _ _ _ E _
We need T and R in positions 1,3, or 5 (since 2 is excluded for R).

Possible combinations:
1. R _ T E _ : but T would be at 3, R at 1
2. T _ R E _ : but R would be at 3
3. _ R T E _ : but R at 2 is excluded
4. _ T R E _ : but R at 3
5. R T _ E _ : T at 2
6. T R _ E _ : R at 2 is excluded

Looking at valid words:
- ""TROVE"" - V is allowed, but O is allowed, but V is allowed, but we have E at 4, so T R O V E - but E is at 5, which contradicts E at 4.
- ""TREND"" - N and D are out.
- ""TREES"" - S is out.
- ""TOWER"" - W is out.
- ""CRORE"" - R is allowed, but O is allowed, but E is at 4, so C R O _ E - but needs 5 letters. ""CRORE"" has E at 5, which is wrong.
- ""FRORE"" - same issue.
- ""GRORE"" - same.
- ""TROPE"" - P is allowed, T R O P E - E at 5 is wrong.
- ""TROVE"" - same.
- ""TREED"" - D is out.
- ""TRENT"" - N is out.
- ""TREES"" - S is out.
- ""TREND"" - N is out.
- ""TREYS"" - Y is allowed, S is out.
- ""TRENT"" - N is out.
- ""TREES"" - S is out.
- ""TREND"" - N is out.
- ""TROVE"" - W is out.
- ""TROPE"" - E at 5 is wrong.
- ""TROCK"" - C and K are allowed, but T R O C K - E is missing.
- ""TROVE"" - W is out.
- ""TROPE"" - E at 5 is wrong.
- ""TROCK"" - no E.
- ""TROVE"" - W is out.
- ""TROPE"" - E at 5 is wrong.
- ""TROCK"" - no E.

Wait, we need E at position 4, so the word is _ _ _ E _. We need T and R in positions 1,2,3, or 5.

Possible letters left: C, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

Let's try:
- R T _ E _ : T at 2, R at 1, but we need a 5th letter. R T _ E _ with allowed letters: R T O E _ - but needs 5 letters. ""RTO_E"" doesn't form a word.
- T R _ E _ : R at 2 is excluded from BRITE feedback.

This suggests we need to use remaining letters more creatively. Let's list possible 5-letter words with E at 4, containing T and R, using allowed letters.

Possible combinations:
1. R _ _ E T : R at 1, T at 5. Need two letters in between from allowed set. ""R O V E T"" - but V is allowed, O is allowed. ""ROVET"" - not a valid word.
2. T _ _ E R : T at 1, R at 5. ""T O P E R"" - P is allowed, O is allowed. ""TOPER"" - valid word.
3. _ R _ E T : R at 2 is excluded.
4. _ T _ E R : T at 2, R at 5. ""C T O E R"" - not valid.
5. _ _ R E T : R at 3, T at 5. ""P O R E T"" - ""PORET"" - not valid.
6. R _ T E _ : T at 3, but needs 5th letter. ""R O T E _"" - ""ROTE_"" - no.
7. _ R T E _ : R at 2 is excluded.
8. _ _ T E R : T at 4 is excluded (E is there).
9. _ T R E _ : R at 3, T at 2. ""C T R E _"" - no.
10. T _ R E _ : R at 3, T at 1. ""T O R E _"" - ""T O R E Y"" - ""TORY"" is 4 letters, ""TORY_"" - no.
11. T _ _ E R : T at 1, R at 5. ""T O P E R"" - valid word.

""TOPER"" seems to be the only valid word fitting the criteria:
- T at 1
- O at 2
- P at 3
- E at 4 (fixed)
- R at 5

All letters are allowed (T, O, P, E, R) and positions are new for T and R.

Based on the feedback, the word must have:
- E fixed at position 4
- T and R somewhere in positions 1,2,3, or 5
- No S, L, A, N, D, H, W, B, I

The valid word that fits these constraints is:

- B is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- I is NOT in the word (x)
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

Wait, this contradicts earlier feedback where E was confirmed at position 4 (✓). The feedback here shows E(-), which implies E is in the word but not at position 5. But we already know E is correctly at position 4. This suggests the feedback might be indicating that E is in the word but not at position 5, which is consistent because E is at position 4. However, the previous feedback on THREW already had E(✓) at position 4, so this new feedback should not override that. It seems the feedback is indicating that E is in the word but not at position 5, which is redundant since we know it's at 4.

Reconciling the feedback:
- From THREW: E(✓) at position 4 (fixed)
- From BRITE: E(-) means E is not at position 5 (consistent, since it's at 4)

So the key new information is:
- B and I are NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not at position 2 (-)
- T is in the word but not at position 4 (-)

Letters known to be in the word: T, R, E (with E fixed at position 4)
Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, L, A, N, D, H, W, B, I

Remaining letters: C, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word with:
- E at position 4
- T and R somewhere in positions 1,2,3, or 5
- Only using the allowed letters

Possible positions for T and R:
- T can be at 1,2,3, or 5
- R can be at 1,2,3, or 5 (but not 2 from BRITE feedback)

Let's try to form words:
- _ _ _ E _
We need T and R in positions 1,3, or 5 (since 2 is excluded for R).

Possible combinations:
1. R _ T E _ : but T would be at 3, R at 1
2. T _ R E _ : but R would be at 3
3. _ R T E _ : but R at 2 is excluded
4. _ T R E _ : but R at 3
5. R T _ E _ : T at 2
6. T R _ E _ : R at 2 is excluded

Looking at valid words:
- ""TROVE"" - V is allowed, but O is allowed, but V is allowed, but we have E at 4, so T R O V E - but E is at 5, which contradicts E at 4.
- ""TREND"" - N and D are out.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a good choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- L is NOT in the word (x)
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains T and E, but they are not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain S, L, or A.

Next guess should:
- Include T and E (but not in positions 4 and 5)
- Avoid S, L, A
- Use other common letters to maximize information

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

A good word could be ""TREND"":
- T in position 1 (not 4, so possible)
- E in position 2 (not 5, so possible)
- R, N, D are new letters to test
- Avoids S, L, A

Guess 2: TREND -> FEEDBACK: T(-) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
So far we have:

Letters known to be in the word but in unknown positions: T, E, R  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: S, L, A, N, D  

That leaves us with a set of 17 remaining letters (all others) to work with.  
We need a 5-letter word that uses T, E, R plus two more letters from the remaining pool, and must avoid S, L, A, N, D.

A good next guess should:
1. Include T, E, R (since we know they’re in the word).
2. Place them in new positions to narrow down their correct spots.
3. Introduce two new, common letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Common unused letters: I, O, U, C, M, P, H, etc.

Let’s try “REACT”:
- R in position 1 (new)
- E in position 2 (new)
- A is already ruled out (x in SLATE), so REACT is invalid.

Next option: “THREW”:
- T, H, R, E, W
- H and W are new, and positions are different from before.

Check positions:
- T was in position 1 in TREND → now position 1 again. Not ideal, but acceptable.
- E was in position 3 in TREND → now position 4. New position.
- R was in position 2 in TREND → now position 3. New position.

This seems better because it moves E and R to new positions while keeping T in a new spot.

From the new feedback on THREW:

- H is NOT in the word (x).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- E is in the correct position (✓) at position 4.
- W is NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
Letters in the word: T, R, E (with E fixed at position 4)
Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, N, D, H, W

Positions so far:
- Position 4: E (fixed)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 4
- Contains T and R somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, N, D, H, W
- Uses only the remaining letters: B, C, F, G, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

Let's list possible letters for positions 1,2,3,5 from the remaining set and try to form valid words.

Looking at common endings with E in position 4:
- _ _ _ E _

We need T and R somewhere. Let's try to place them in positions 1,2,3, or 5.

Possible words:
- ""CREEK"" - but has E in position 2 and 3, and K is allowed, but we need T and R. Not valid.
- ""BREEZ"" - Z is allowed, but missing R.
- ""TREND"" - N and D are out.
- ""CRETE"" - C and T allowed, but E is already at 4, and we need R. Not valid.
- ""BRITE"" - B, R, I, T, E - fits! It has B, R, I, T, E. E is at 4, T at 5, R at 2. All letters are allowed.

Check:
- B: new, allowed
- R: in word, position 2 (new)
- I: new, allowed
- T: in word, position 5 (new)
- E: correct at 4

This seems perfect as it tests new letters and positions for T and R.

Remaining letters that are still possible (from the alphabet excluding the known negatives): C, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word with:
- Pattern: _ _ _ E R
- Must contain T and O somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3
- T cannot be at position 1 (from TOPER feedback)
- O cannot be at position 2 (from TOPER feedback)

Possible positions for T and O:
- T can be at position 2 or 3
- O can be at position 1 or 3 (but not at 2)

Let's list valid combinations:
1. O T _ E R: O at 1, T at 2, need one letter at 3 from remaining allowed letters
2. T O _ E R: T at 1 is invalid (from TOPER feedback)
3. _ O T E R: O at 2 is invalid (from TOPER feedback)
4. _ T O E R: T at 2, O at 3
5. T _ O E R: T at 1 is invalid
6. _ _ O T E R: would be 6 letters, invalid

Valid patterns:
- O T _ E R
- _ T O E R
- _ _ T E O R: invalid (6 letters)

Now check which of these form valid words with allowed letters.

1. O T _ E R:
   - Need one letter at position 3 from remaining: C, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z
   - Possible words: OTGER, OTFER, OTGER, etc. None seem valid.

2. _ T O E R:
   - First letter must be from remaining allowed letters: C, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z
   - Possible words: CTOER, FTOER, GTOER, etc. None seem valid.

Wait, let's think differently - maybe the word has T and O in positions 2 and 3 in some order, but with other letters.

But we need exactly T and O in the word, and positions 4 and 5 fixed as E and R.

Another approach: list all 5-letter words ending in ""ER"" with E in 4th position, R in 5th, containing T and O, and check constraints.

Possible words:
- ""COTER"" - C, O, T, E, R - but ""COTER"" is not a valid English word.
- ""GOTER"" - not valid.
- ""MOTER"" - not valid.
- ""OTOR"" - too short.
- ""TROER"" - invalid.
- ""VOTER"" - V, O, T, E, R - ""VOTER"" is a valid word.

Check constraints for ""VOTER"":
- V: allowed (not in banned list)
- O: allowed, position 2 (but TOPER feedback said O is not at position 2) - conflict!
From TOPER feedback: O(-) means O is in the word but not at position 2. So ""VOTER"" has O at position 2 - invalid.
