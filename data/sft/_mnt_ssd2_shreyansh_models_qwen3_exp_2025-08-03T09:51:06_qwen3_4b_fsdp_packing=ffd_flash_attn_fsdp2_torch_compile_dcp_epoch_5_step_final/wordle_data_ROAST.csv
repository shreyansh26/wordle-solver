### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word should ideally include:
- Common vowels like A, E, I, O, U
- Common consonants like R, S, T, L, N
- No repeated letters to test more unique letters

Looking at these criteria, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are among the most common in English
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All unique letters
- It covers a good spread of letters that could appear in many 5-letter words

This will give us maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3
- S(✓): S is in the word and is in position 4
- E(x): E is not in the word at all

So far we know:
- The word has the pattern _ _ _ S _
- It contains A, R, O somewhere, but not in their original positions (1, 2, 3 respectively)
- It does not contain E

We need a new word that:
1. Has S in the 4th position
2. Contains A, R, O
3. Does not contain E
4. Does not repeat letters already placed (no A in 1st, R in 2nd, O in 3rd)

Possible candidates:
- R A O S _ → but O can't be in 3rd
- _ O A S R → but R can't be in 5th
- R A _ S O → but O can't be in 5th
- _ A R S O → but O can't be in 5th
- _ O R S A → A can be in 5th (since A was only excluded from 1st)
- A R _ S O → A can't be in 1st, R can't be in 2nd
- O R A S _ → O can't be in 1st, R can't be in 2nd

Looking at _ O R S A:
- O is in 2nd (was in 3rd in AROSE, so allowed)
- R is in 3rd (was in 2nd in AROSE, so allowed)
- A is in 5th (was in 1st in AROSE, so allowed)
- S is in 4th (correct)
- No E
- All letters unique

This seems valid. Let's check if ""ORAS"" is a word - actually it's ""ORAS"" but that's not a common word. Wait, let me think of common words.

Another candidate: ""RAOIS"" - but that's not a word.
""ROAST"" - has T, but we don't know about T yet. Let's see:
- R in 1st (was in 2nd, so allowed)
- O in 2nd (was in 3rd, so allowed)
- A in 3rd (was in 1st, so allowed)
- S in 4th (correct)
- T in 5th (unknown)
But we have no info about T yet.

But we know the word must be common. ""RAOIS"" isn't a word, ""ROAST"" is a word but has T which we haven't tested.

Another candidate: ""ORCAS"" - but C is new, and we have no info on C yet.

Looking back, ""RAOIS"" isn't valid. Let me think of common words with S in 4th, containing A, R, O.

""ROAST"" seems the best, even though it introduces T. Alternatively, ""ORATE"" but E is excluded.

Wait, we know E is not in the word. So ""ORATE"" is out.

Another candidate: ""AROSE"" - but that's the first guess and we know E is out.

""RAJAS"" - has J which is new.

""RAZOR"" - has Z and R in 5th (but R was in 2nd and is allowed anywhere except 2nd).

But let's think systematically: positions are _ _ _ S _ and must contain A, R, O in some permutation not conflicting with previous positions.

Possible permutations of A, R, O in positions 1,2,3,5:

1. A R O S _ : A can't be 1st, R can't be 2nd, O can't be 3rd - invalid
2. A O R S _ : A can't be 1st - invalid
3. R A O S _ : R can't be 1st (was in 2nd), A can't be 2nd (was in 1st), O can't be 3rd - invalid
4. R O A S _ : R can be 1st (was in 2nd), O can be 2nd (was in 3rd), A can be 3rd (was in 1st) - valid
5. O A R S _ : O can be 1st (was in 3rd), A can be 2nd (was in 1st), R can be 3rd (was in 2nd) - valid
6. O R A S _ : O can be 1st (was in 3rd), R can be 2nd (was in 2nd) - invalid (R can't be 2nd)
7. A R S O _ - but S is fixed in 4th
8. etc.

So valid permutations are:
- R O A S _ : needs a 5th letter. But we have A, R, O, S already, so 5th must be one of them - but they're all used. So this would require a duplicate which we can't have (since AROSE had no duplicates).
Wait, the word must be 5 letters with S in 4th, and contain A, R, O. So the letters are A, R, O, S, and one more letter. But we have no info on the 5th letter yet.

This suggests I need to include an extra letter. Let me reconsider.

The word must be _ _ _ S _ and contain A, R, O, but can have other letters. The 5th letter is unknown.

Looking at possible common words:
- ""RAOIS"" - invalid
- ""ROAST"" - valid word, introduces T
- ""ORCAS"" - introduces C
- ""ORATE"" - introduces E (invalid)
- ""RAJAS"" - introduces J
- ""RAZOR"" - introduces Z

Among these, ""ROAST"" seems the most common word. Let's go with that.

Check ""ROAST"":
- R in 1st (was in 2nd in AROSE, so allowed)
- O in 2nd (was in 3rd in AROSE, so allowed)
- A in 3rd (was in 1st in AROSE, so allowed)
- S in 4th (correct)
- T in 5th (new letter, no info yet)

This seems the best possible next guess.
</think>

Based on the feedback from AROSE, we know:
- S is in position 4
- A, R, and O are all in the word but not in positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively
- E is not in the word

The most logical next guess is ROAST, which places:
- R in position 1 (allowed, since R was only excluded from position 2)
- O in position 2 (allowed, since O was excluded from position 3)
- A in position 3 (allowed, since A was excluded from position 1)
- S in position 4 (confirmed)
- T in position 5 (a new letter we haven't tested yet)
