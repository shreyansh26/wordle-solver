### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses five of these common letters to help eliminate or confirm as many possibilities as early as possible. A good choice would be ""RAISE"" - it contains R, A, I, S, E, all very common letters, and gives me a broad starting point to gather information about the secret word.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R, A, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains I, but not in position 3.
- Does NOT contain R, A, S, E.

I now need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has the letter I somewhere (but not in the 3rd spot).
2. Avoids R, A, S, E entirely.

Looking at common letters left: T, N, L, O, U, C, M, D, H, etc.

A good next guess should use fresh common letters while incorporating I.  
""POINT"" uses P, O, I, N, T – none of the excluded letters, and places I in position 3 (which we now know is wrong, so this will help confirm where I actually belongs).  
Another candidate could be ""MILCH"" or ""DINER"", but ""POINT"" feels more balanced.

I'll go with POINT to gather new positional information.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T
- The letter I is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from both guesses).

Therefore, I must be in position 1 or 2.

Remaining common letters (excluding the eliminated ones) include: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next guess should:
1. Place I in either position 1 or 2 to test its correct spot.
2. Use other fresh common letters to maximize information.

Testing I in position 1: ""ICING"" uses C, I, N, G. But N is already eliminated, so invalid.
Testing I in position 2: ""BINGO"" uses B, I, N, G, O – but N and O are eliminated.
Next option: ""FILMY"" – uses F, I, L, M, Y. All letters are still possible, and it places I in position 2.
