1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information we can gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains common letters (S, L, A, T, E) that appear frequently in English words. This will help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word, but not in position 3.

2. CRANK → C(-) R(-) A(-) N(x) K(x)  
   – C, R, and A are in the word, but all in wrong positions.  
   – N and K are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters that are in the word: A, C, R  
- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, N, K  
- A cannot be in position 3, C cannot be in position 1, R cannot be in position 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, C, R exactly once each.  
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E, N, K.  
- Places A, C, R in positions other than their previous wrong positions.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: I, O, U  

Let’s try to build a word with A, C, R plus two new letters.  
A good candidate is “CARBO” but it contains B and O.  
However, we must avoid any of the eliminated letters.  
“CARBO” uses C, A, R, B, O – none of the forbidden letters.  
But A is in position 2, which was not ruled out.  
C is in position 1 – but in CRANK it was in position 1 and marked (-), so C cannot be in position 1.  
So “CARBO” is invalid because C would be in position 1 again.

Next candidate: “ARGON” – but G and O are allowed, but N is forbidden.  
“ARGON” contains N (forbidden), so invalid.

Next: “CRAZY” – Z is allowed, but Y is allowed.  
But A is in position 2, C in 1 (invalid), R in 2 (invalid).  
No, this is invalid.

Next: “ACRID” – D is allowed.  
A is in 1, C in 2, R in 3, I in 4, D in 5.  
Check forbidden letters: none of S,L,T,E,N,K appear.  
Positions:  
- A is in 1 (not 3) – allowed.  
- C is in 2 (not 1) – allowed.  
- R is in 3 (not 2) – allowed.  
So “ACRID” is valid.

- Positions:
  – Position 3 is R (fixed)
  – A cannot be in positions 1, 3 (from SLATE and ACRID)

So we need a 5-letter word with:

- A somewhere in positions 2,4,5
- C somewhere in positions 3,4,5 (but 3 is R, so 4 or 5)
- Other letters must be from the allowed set {B,F,G,H,M,P,U,V,W,Y}

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the amount of information we can gain. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains common letters (S, L, A, T, E) that appear frequently in English words. This will help us quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but NOT in position 3.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

We now need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A (but not in position 3).
2. Avoids S, L, T, E.

Good letters to try next: common consonants like R, N, C, H, M, P, B, D, etc., and vowels like O, I, U.

A strong next guess should test several new common letters. The word ""CRANK"" uses C, R, N, K, and A. It avoids the eliminated letters and places A in a new position (4th). This should give us more information.

Let’s go with CRANK.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CRANK -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(-) N(x) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word, but not in position 3.

2. CRANK → C(-) R(-) A(-) N(x) K(x)  
   – C, R, and A are in the word, but all in wrong positions.  
   – N and K are NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters that are in the word: A, C, R  
- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, N, K  
- A cannot be in position 3, C cannot be in position 1, R cannot be in position 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, C, R exactly once each.  
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E, N, K.  
- Places A, C, R in positions other than their previous wrong positions.

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y  
Remaining vowels: I, O, U  

Let’s try to build a word with A, C, R plus two new letters.  
A good candidate is “CARBO” but it contains B and O.  
However, we must avoid any of the eliminated letters.  
“CARBO” uses C, A, R, B, O – none of the forbidden letters.  
But A is in position 2, which was not ruled out.  
C is in position 1 – but in CRANK it was in position 1 and marked (-), so C cannot be in position 1.  
So “CARBO” is invalid because C would be in position 1 again.

Next candidate: “ARGON” – but G and O are allowed, but N is forbidden.  
“ARGON” contains N (forbidden), so invalid.

Next: “CRAZY” – Z is allowed, but Y is allowed.  
But A is in position 2, C in 1 (invalid), R in 2 (invalid).  
No, this is invalid.

Next: “ACRID” – D is allowed.  
A is in 1, C in 2, R in 3, I in 4, D in 5.  
Check forbidden letters: none of S,L,T,E,N,K appear.  
Positions:  
- A is in 1 (not 3) – allowed.  
- C is in 2 (not 1) – allowed.  
- R is in 3 (not 2) – allowed.  
So “ACRID” is valid.

Let’s try ACRID.

   – R is now confirmed in position 3.  
   – A and C are still in the word but in wrong positions.

- Positions:
  – Position 3 is R (fixed)
  – A cannot be in positions 1, 3 (from SLATE and ACRID)

- A somewhere in positions 2,4,5
- C somewhere in positions 3,4,5 (but 3 is R, so 4 or 5)
- Other letters must be from the allowed set {B,F,G,H,M,P,U,V,W,Y}

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):  
From earlier elimination list, remaining allowed letters are:  
F, G, H, M, P, U, V, W (since B, S, L, T, E, N, K, I, D, Y are all excluded).

We need two distinct letters from this set to fill positions 1 and 5.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ A R C _:

- F A R C H  
- F A R C E → E is excluded  
- G A R C H  
- H A R C H  
- P A R C H  
- M A R C H  
- V A R C H  
- W A R C H  

Among these, “MARCH” is a valid English word and uses only allowed letters.

Let’s confirm:
M (allowed), A (correct position), R (correct position), C (correct position), H (allowed).  
No previously excluded letters are used.

<guess>MARCH</guess>",MARCH,"From the new feedback on BARCY:

- B(x) → B is NOT in the word  
- A(✓) → A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2)  
- R(✓) → R is in the word and in the correct position (position 3)  
- C(✓) → C is in the word and in the correct position (position 4)  
- Y(x) → Y is NOT in the word  

So the secret word is now fully determined as:

_ A R C _

We only need to find the first and fifth letters.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out):  
From earlier elimination list, remaining allowed letters are:  
F, G, H, M, P, U, V, W (since B, S, L, T, E, N, K, I, D, Y are all excluded).

We need two distinct letters from this set to fill positions 1 and 5.

Looking for common 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ A R C _:

- F A R C H  
- F A R C E → E is excluded  
- G A R C H  
- H A R C H  
- P A R C H  
- M A R C H  
- V A R C H  
- W A R C H  

Among these, “MARCH” is a valid English word and uses only allowed letters.

Let’s confirm:
M (allowed), A (correct position), R (correct position), C (correct position), H (allowed).  
No previously excluded letters are used.

Therefore, the correct word should be MARCH.",Guess 5: MARCH -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) R(✓) C(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
