1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- S, L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- And it has 5 unique letters, maximizing information gain.

This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities for the next guesses based on the feedback.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A are NOT in the word (x)
- T and E are in the word but in wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains T and E
- Does NOT contain S, L, A
- T and E are misplaced from positions 4 and 5 in SLATE

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes T and E
2. Excludes S, L, A
3. Places T and E in different positions than 4 and 5

A good next guess should introduce new common letters while respecting these constraints. The word ""ENTER"" comes to mind:
- It has E and T (which we know are in the word)
- It introduces N and R (common letters not yet tested)
- It places E in position 1 (different from position 5) and T in position 3 (different from position 4)

This should help determine the correct positions for T and E while gaining information about N and R.

From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
   - T and E are in the word but in wrong positions.
   - S, L, A are not in the word.

2. ENTER → E(-) N(x) T(✓) E(-) R(x)
   - T is now confirmed in the 3rd position (✓).
   - E is still in the word but in wrong positions (both first and fourth positions are wrong).
   - N and R are not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Has T in position 3.
- Has E somewhere else (positions 2 or 5 are still possible, since 1 and 4 are ruled out).
- Does not contain S, L, A, N, R.

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a word that:
- Has T in the 3rd position.
- Has E in position 2 or 5.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ E T _ _  (E in position 2)
- _ _ T _ E  (E in position 5)

Let me think of words fitting these patterns with new letters.

For _ E T _ _:
- METAL: uses A (already ruled out)
- BETEL: uses B and L (L ruled out)
- PETIT: uses P, I (but T is already in position 3, so PETIT would have T in position 4 - but T must be in position 3, so this doesn't fit)
- VETTO: uses V, O (but double T might not be needed)

For _ _ T _ E:
- ABOUT: uses A (ruled out)
- COTTE: uses C, O (but double T might not be needed)
- HOTTE: uses H, O (but E is in position 5 here)
- MOTTED: too long
- POTTY: uses P, O, Y (but T is in position 3, so POTTY would have T in position 3 and 4 - but T must be in position 3 only)

Actually, let me think of simpler words:

- METAL: A ruled out
- BETEL: L ruled out
- PETIT: T in position 4 conflicts with T in position 3
- VETAL: A ruled out
- COTTE: C, O, T, T, E - but T is in position 3 only, so COTTE has T in position 3 and 4 - but we don't know about double T yet
- HETTE: H, E, T, T, E - same issue
- VETTO: V, E, T, T, O - T in position 3 and 4
- METRO: A ruled out, R ruled out
- BETON: B, E, T, O, N - N ruled out
- PETAL: A ruled out
- VELT: too short

Let me try COTTE:
- C, O, T, T, E
- T is in position 3 (matches ✓)
- E is in position 5 (not ruled out yet)
- C and O are new letters
- T appears twice - we don't know if the word has double T yet

This seems like a good test to see if T appears twice and where E goes.

Another option: HOTTE
- H, O, T, T, E
- Same as COTTE, testing T twice and E in position 5

Between these, COTTE seems slightly more common.

I'll go with COTTE to test for double T and position of E.

- COTTE: C, O, T, T, E - but T is in position 3 only, so COTTE has T in position 3 and 4 - but we don't know about double T yet
- HETTE: H, E, T, T, E - same issue

- METRO: A ruled out, R ruled out
- BETON: B, E, T, O, N - N ruled out
- PETAL: A ruled out
- VELT: too short

Let me try COTTE:
- C, O, T, T, E
- T is in position 3 (matches ✓)
- E is in position 5 (not ruled out yet)
- C and O are new letters
- T appears twice - we don't know if the word has double T yet

This seems like a good test to see if T appears twice and where E goes.

Another option: HOTTE
- H, O, T, T, E
- Same as COTTE, testing T twice and E in position 5

Between these, COTTE seems slightly more common.

I'll go with COTTE to test for double T and position of E.

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
   - T and E are in the word, but positions unknown (so far T not in 4, E not in 5).
   - S, L, A are out.

2. ENTER → E(-) N(x) T(✓) E(-) R(x)
   - T is now locked in position 3.
   - E is still in the word, but positions 1 and 4 are wrong.
   - N and R are out.

3. COTTE → C(x) O(-) T(✓) T(-) E(-)
   - T is still correct in position 3.
   - O is in the word but not in position 2.
   - The second T (position 4) is marked (-), meaning T is not in position 4.
   - E is still in the word but positions 1, 4, 5 are wrong (from previous and this feedback).

So the word must:
- Have T in position 3.
- Have E in position 2 (only remaining spot for E).
- Have O somewhere other than position 2.
- No S, L, A, N, R, C.

Current pattern: _ E T _ _

Letters still allowed (excluding the ruled-out set): B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two more letters for positions 1 and 5, with O somewhere (must be in position 1 or 5).

Possible combinations:
- O E T _ _  (O in position 1)
- _ E T _ O  (O in position 5)

Let's think of words fitting these patterns.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting guess because it contains:
- S, L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- And it has 5 unique letters, maximizing information gain.

This should give me good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities for the next guesses based on the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A are NOT in the word (x)
- T and E are in the word but in wrong positions (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains T and E
- Does NOT contain S, L, A
- T and E are misplaced from positions 4 and 5 in SLATE

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes T and E
2. Excludes S, L, A
3. Places T and E in different positions than 4 and 5

A good next guess should introduce new common letters while respecting these constraints. The word ""ENTER"" comes to mind:
- It has E and T (which we know are in the word)
- It introduces N and R (common letters not yet tested)
- It places E in position 1 (different from position 5) and T in position 3 (different from position 4)

This should help determine the correct positions for T and E while gaining information about N and R.

Guess 2: ENTER -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(x) T(✓) E(-) R(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two guesses so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(-) E(-)
   - T and E are in the word but in wrong positions.
   - S, L, A are not in the word.

2. ENTER → E(-) N(x) T(✓) E(-) R(x)
   - T is now confirmed in the 3rd position (✓).
   - E is still in the word but in wrong positions (both first and fourth positions are wrong).
   - N and R are not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Has T in position 3.
- Has E somewhere else (positions 2 or 5 are still possible, since 1 and 4 are ruled out).
- Does not contain S, L, A, N, R.

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I need a word that:
- Has T in the 3rd position.
- Has E in position 2 or 5.
- Uses only the allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ E T _ _  (E in position 2)
- _ _ T _ E  (E in position 5)

Let me think of words fitting these patterns with new letters.

For _ E T _ _:
- METAL: uses A (already ruled out)
- BETEL: uses B and L (L ruled out)
- PETIT: uses P, I (but T is already in position 3, so PETIT would have T in position 4 - but T must be in position 3, so this doesn't fit)
- VETTO: uses V, O (but double T might not be needed)

For _ _ T _ E:
- ABOUT: uses A (ruled out)
- COTTE: uses C, O (but double T might not be needed)
- HOTTE: uses H, O (but E is in position 5 here)
- MOTTED: too long
- POTTY: uses P, O, Y (but T is in position 3, so POTTY would have T in position 3 and 4 - but T must be in position 3 only)

Actually, let me think of simpler words:

- METAL: A ruled out
- BETEL: L ruled out
- PETIT: T in position 4 conflicts with T in position 3
- VETAL: A ruled out
- COTTE: C, O, T, T, E - but T is in position 3 only, so COTTE has T in position 3 and 4 - but we don't know about double T yet
- HETTE: H, E, T, T, E - same issue
- VETTO: V, E, T, T, O - T in position 3 and 4
- METRO: A ruled out, R ruled out
- BETON: B, E, T, O, N - N ruled out
- PETAL: A ruled out
- VELT: too short

Let me try COTTE:
- C, O, T, T, E
- T is in position 3 (matches ✓)
- E is in position 5 (not ruled out yet)
- C and O are new letters
- T appears twice - we don't know if the word has double T yet

This seems like a good test to see if T appears twice and where E goes.

Another option: HOTTE
- H, O, T, T, E
- Same as COTTE, testing T twice and E in position 5

Between these, COTTE seems slightly more common.

I'll go with COTTE to test for double T and position of E.

From the latest feedback on FETID:
- F(x) → F is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in the correct position (position 2).
- T(✓) → T is in the word AND in the correct position (position 3).
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word.
- D(-) → D is in the word but in the wrong position.

So the word now looks like: _ E T _ _

Known letters:
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: T
- Must contain D, but not in position 5 (since D(-) in FETID means D isn't in position 5).

Letters already ruled out: S, L, A, N, R, C, F, I.

Letters still allowed: B, D, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We know D must appear somewhere, and it can't be in position 5, so D must be in position 1 or 4.

Possible patterns:
1. D E T _ _  (D in position 1)
2. _ E T D _  (D in position 4)

Let's explore both.

Pattern 1: D E T _ _
Need two more letters for positions 4 and 5. Possible letters (excluding ruled-out): B, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
We also know from COTTE feedback that O is in the word but not in position 2 (already satisfied here).

Possible words:
- DETOX: X is allowed, but O is in position 4 (allowed), X in 5 (allowed)
- DETON: N is ruled out
- DETRO: R is ruled out
- DETAL: A is ruled out
- DETIC: C is ruled out
- DETIT: double T might be possible, but we don't know
- DETOX seems valid

Pattern 2: _ E T D _
Need a first letter and a fifth letter from allowed set.
Possible words:
- BETUD: not a word
- METUD: not a word
- PETUD: not a word
- VETUD: not a word
- GETHD: not a word
- KETUD: not a word
- OETUD: not a word
- UETUD: not a word
- WETUD: not a word
- YETUD: not a word
- ZETUD: not a word

Pattern 1 seems more promising. DETOX uses O and X, both allowed, and tests O in position 4 (allowed) and X in position 5 (new letter).

Let's check if DETOX is a valid word: yes, it means a substance that removes toxins.

This guess should confirm:
- D in position 1 (since D(-) in FETID meant D not in 5, so 1 or 4; testing 1 here)
- O in position 4 (testing O, which was marked (-) in COTTE meaning it's in word but not position 2)
- X in position 5 (new letter)

This should help determine the exact placement of D and any remaining letters.
