### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A balanced first guess might include several of these.

A popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters in various positions.

Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices. A balanced first guess might include several of these.\n\nA popular and effective first guess is ""SLATE"" because it contains:\n- S (very common starting letter)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (common vowel)\n- T (common consonant)\n- E (most common vowel)\n\nThis combination gives us good coverage of common letters in various positions.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(-) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n- S(x) – S is not in the word at all.\n- L(-) – L is in the word, but not in position 2.\n- A(x) – A is not in the word.\n- T(-) – T is in the word, but not in position 4.\n- E(✓) – E is in the word and in position 5.\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Ends with E.\n- Contains L and T somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 4 respectively.\n- Does not contain S or A.\n\nWe need a new 5-letter word that satisfies these constraints.

We now know the exact pattern:

L I T _ E

and we know the missing letter (position 4) is NOT R.  
Letters already ruled out entirely: S, A.  
Letters already used and confirmed in place: L, I, T, E.

Remaining common letters for the blank (not yet ruled out) include: N, C, M, P, Y, etc.

The most straightforward English word that fits is “LITNE” — but that’s not a valid word.  
Next simplest: “LITHE” — H has not been ruled out and makes a valid word.

So we guess LITHE.
