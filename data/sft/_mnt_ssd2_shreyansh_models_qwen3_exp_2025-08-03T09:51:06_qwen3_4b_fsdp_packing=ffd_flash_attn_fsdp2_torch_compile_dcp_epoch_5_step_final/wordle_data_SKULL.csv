For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify key vowels and consonants. A good starting word often contains common letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. One such word is ""SLATE"" - it includes S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters in English words. This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in the first position.

Next guess should:
- Keep S in position 1
- Try L in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since it can't be 2)
- Avoid A, T, E

- S stays in position 1
- L is not present, so we can test other positions for L in future
- Introduces H, O, R, N - all common letters not yet tested
- Doesn't use any forbidden letters (A, T, E)

From the new feedback on SKULK:
- S(✓) – still correct in position 1.
- K(✓) – correct in position 2.
- U(✓) – correct in position 3.
- L(✓) – correct in position 4.
- K(-) – the second K is in the word but in the wrong position (position 5).

So the pattern so far is:
S K U L _

We now know the word starts with “SKUL” and the last letter is a K that must appear somewhere in the word (but not in position 5). However, since we have already used positions 1-4, the only remaining position for the second K is position 5, which contradicts the feedback that K is not in position 5. This implies the word must contain exactly one K, but the feedback shows K appears twice (once in position 2 and once in position 5). This is impossible unless the word has two Ks, but the feedback clearly states the second K is not in position 5.

Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully:
- SKULK -> S(✓) K(✓) U(✓) L(✓) K(-)

This means:
- Position 1: S is correct.
- Position 2: K is correct.
- Position 3: U is correct.
- Position 4: L is correct.
- Position 5: K is in the word but not in position 5 (which is impossible because position 5 is the last position).

This suggests the word must be “SKULK” itself, but the feedback for position 5 shows K(-), meaning K is not in position 5. This is a contradiction unless there's a misunderstanding. However, the feedback for SKULK shows all letters except the last K as correct, implying the word is “SKUL_” with a K somewhere else, but since K is already in position 2, the only possible position left for the second K is position 5, which is marked as wrong. This seems like the game is indicating the word is “SKULK” but with the last K marked as wrong, which is impossible.

Upon closer inspection, the feedback must be interpreted as:
- The letters S, K, U, L are all correct in their respective positions (1,2,3,4).
- The last letter K is in the word but not in position 5, which is impossible because the word is 5 letters and positions 1-4 are already filled with S,K,U,L. This suggests the word must be “SKULK”, but that would have K in position 5, which is marked as wrong.

This indicates the feedback is indicating that the word is “SKULK” but with the last K marked as wrong, which is a contradiction. However, the only possible conclusion is that the word is “SKULK” and the feedback for the last K is a mistake, or the game allows for duplicate letters where the second K is in position 5 but marked as wrong, which is impossible.

Given this confusion, the most logical word that fits the feedback is “SKULK” itself, despite the apparent contradiction. Therefore, the next guess should be “SKULK” to confirm.

Based on the feedback:
- Positions 1-4 are S, K, U, L respectively.
- The last letter must be K (since it's in the word) but cannot be in position 5, which is impossible unless the word is ""SKULK"".

- L in position 2 is wrong (feedback said L is in wrong position), so this is bad
Next option: ""SNAIL"":
- S in 1
- L in 5 (possible)
- Tests N, A, I - but A is forbidden
""SWILL"":
- S in 1
- L in 4 (possible)
- Tests W, I, L - but double L might not help
""SHILL"":
- S in 1
- L in 4 (possible)
- Tests H, I, L - but double L
""SKULK"":
- S in 1

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: SKULK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) K(✓) U(✓) L(✓) K(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on SKULK:
- S(✓) – still correct in position 1.
- K(✓) – correct in position 2.
- U(✓) – correct in position 3.
- L(✓) – correct in position 4.
- K(-) – the second K is in the word but in the wrong position (position 5).

So the pattern so far is:
S K U L _

We now know the word starts with “SKUL” and the last letter is a K that must appear somewhere in the word (but not in position 5). However, since we have already used positions 1-4, the only remaining position for the second K is position 5, which contradicts the feedback that K is not in position 5. This implies the word must contain exactly one K, but the feedback shows K appears twice (once in position 2 and once in position 5). This is impossible unless the word has two Ks, but the feedback clearly states the second K is not in position 5.

Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully:
- SKULK -> S(✓) K(✓) U(✓) L(✓) K(-)

This means:
- Position 1: S is correct.
- Position 2: K is correct.
- Position 3: U is correct.
- Position 4: L is correct.
- Position 5: K is in the word but not in position 5 (which is impossible because position 5 is the last position).

This suggests the word must be “SKULK” itself, but the feedback for position 5 shows K(-), meaning K is not in position 5. This is a contradiction unless there's a misunderstanding. However, the feedback for SKULK shows all letters except the last K as correct, implying the word is “SKUL_” with a K somewhere else, but since K is already in position 2, the only possible position left for the second K is position 5, which is marked as wrong. This seems like the game is indicating the word is “SKULK” but with the last K marked as wrong, which is impossible.

Upon closer inspection, the feedback must be interpreted as:
- The letters S, K, U, L are all correct in their respective positions (1,2,3,4).
- The last letter K is in the word but not in position 5, which is impossible because the word is 5 letters and positions 1-4 are already filled with S,K,U,L. This suggests the word must be “SKULK”, but that would have K in position 5, which is marked as wrong.

This indicates the feedback is indicating that the word is “SKULK” but with the last K marked as wrong, which is a contradiction. However, the only possible conclusion is that the word is “SKULK” and the feedback for the last K is a mistake, or the game allows for duplicate letters where the second K is in position 5 but marked as wrong, which is impossible.

Given this confusion, the most logical word that fits the feedback is “SKULK” itself, despite the apparent contradiction. Therefore, the next guess should be “SKULK” to confirm.Based on the feedback:
- Positions 1-4 are S, K, U, L respectively.
- The last letter must be K (since it's in the word) but cannot be in position 5, which is impossible unless the word is ""SKULK"".

The only possible word that fits is:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify key vowels and consonants. A good starting word often contains common letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. One such word is ""SLATE"" - it includes S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters in English words. This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in the first position.
- L is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
1. Word starts with S
2. Contains L somewhere other than second position
3. Does NOT contain A, T, E

Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus L.

Next guess should:
- Keep S in position 1
- Try L in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since it can't be 2)
- Avoid A, T, E
- Introduce new common letters to test

A good candidate is ""SHORN"":
- S stays in position 1
- L is not present, so we can test other positions for L in future
- Introduces H, O, R, N - all common letters not yet tested
- Doesn't use any forbidden letters (A, T, E)

But since we know L must be present somewhere, let's try ""SLING"":
- S in position 1
- L in position 2 is wrong (feedback said L is in wrong position), so this is bad

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify key vowels and consonants. A good starting word often contains common letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. One such word is ""SLATE"" - it includes S, L, A, T, E which are all very common letters in English words. This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in the first position.
- L is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So far we know:
1. Word starts with S
2. Contains L somewhere other than second position
3. Does NOT contain A, T, E

Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z plus L.

Next guess should:
- Keep S in position 1
- Try L in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since it can't be 2)
- Avoid A, T, E
- Introduce new common letters to test

A good candidate is ""SHORN"":
- S stays in position 1
- L is not present, so we can test other positions for L in future
- Introduces H, O, R, N - all common letters not yet tested
- Doesn't use any forbidden letters (A, T, E)

But since we know L must be present somewhere, let's try ""SLING"":
- S in position 1
- L in position 2 is wrong (feedback said L is in wrong position), so this is bad
Next option: ""SNAIL"":
- S in 1
- L in 5 (possible)
- Tests N, A, I - but A is forbidden
""SWILL"":
- S in 1
- L in 4 (possible)
- Tests W, I, L - but double L might not help
""SHILL"":
- S in 1
- L in 4 (possible)
- Tests H, I, L - but double L
""SKULK"":
- S in 1
- L in 3 (possible)
- Tests K, U, K

Best seems ""SKULK"":
- S in 1
- L in 3 (possible)
- Tests K, U, K

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SKULK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) K(✓) U(✓) L(✓) K(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on SKULK:
- S(✓) – still correct in position 1.
- K(✓) – correct in position 2.
- U(✓) – correct in position 3.
- L(✓) – correct in position 4.
- K(-) – the second K is in the word but in the wrong position (position 5).

So the pattern so far is:
S K U L _

We now know the word starts with “SKUL” and the last letter is a K that must appear somewhere in the word (but not in position 5). However, since we have already used positions 1-4, the only remaining position for the second K is position 5, which contradicts the feedback that K is not in position 5. This implies the word must contain exactly one K, but the feedback shows K appears twice (once in position 2 and once in position 5). This is impossible unless the word has two Ks, but the feedback clearly states the second K is not in position 5.

Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully:
- SKULK -> S(✓) K(✓) U(✓) L(✓) K(-)

This means:
- Position 1: S is correct.
- Position 2: K is correct.
- Position 3: U is correct.
- Position 4: L is correct.
- Position 5: K is in the word but not in position 5 (which is impossible because position 5 is the last position).

This suggests the word must be “SKULK” itself, but the feedback for position 5 shows K(-), meaning K is not in position 5. This is a contradiction unless there's a misunderstanding. However, the feedback for SKULK shows all letters except the last K as correct, implying the word is “SKUL_” with a K somewhere else, but since K is already in position 2, the only possible position left for the second K is position 5, which is marked as wrong. This seems like the game is indicating the word is “SKULK” but with the last K marked as wrong, which is impossible.

Upon closer inspection, the feedback must be interpreted as:
- The letters S, K, U, L are all correct in their respective positions (1,2,3,4).
- The last letter K is in the word but not in position 5, which is impossible because the word is 5 letters and positions 1-4 are already filled with S,K,U,L. This suggests the word must be “SKULK”, but that would have K in position 5, which is marked as wrong.

This indicates the feedback is indicating that the word is “SKULK” but with the last K marked as wrong, which is a contradiction. However, the only possible conclusion is that the word is “SKULK” and the feedback for the last K is a mistake, or the game allows for duplicate letters where the second K is in position 5 but marked as wrong, which is impossible.

Given this confusion, the most logical word that fits the feedback is “SKULK” itself, despite the apparent contradiction. Therefore, the next guess should be “SKULK” to confirm.Based on the feedback:
- Positions 1-4 are S, K, U, L respectively.
- The last letter must be K (since it's in the word) but cannot be in position 5, which is impossible unless the word is ""SKULK"".

The only possible word that fits is:

S(✓) K(✓) U(✓) L(✓) K(-)

This pattern is impossible because:
1. Positions 1-4 are fixed: S K U L _
2. The final letter must be K (since it's in the word)
3. The feedback says the final K is NOT in position 5, which is impossible because position 5 is the only remaining spot

The only logical conclusion is that the feedback is indicating the word is SKULK itself, and the final K's ""-"" is an error. Therefore, the correct word is:

SKULK
