### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify vowels and consonants efficiently. A good starting word often contains multiple vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a strong candidate because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which can help me quickly identify which vowels are present
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which are frequently used in English words

This should give me good information about which vowels are in the word and their possible positions, as well as whether R or S are present.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E somewhere (but not in the 5th position)
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S
- Has 5 distinct letters (since all four letters in AROSE were eliminated)

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes E (but E cannot be in position 5)
2. Excludes A, R, O, S
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out)

Let me try a word with E, I, U, and common consonants. ""UNTIE"" is a good candidate:
- Contains E and I (two new vowels)
- Contains T and N (common consonants)
- Does not contain A, R, O, S
- E is in position 4, so if it's still wrong-positioned, we'll know it must be in 1, 2, or 3

This should give us new vowel positions and test other consonants.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me identify vowels and consonants efficiently. A good starting word often contains multiple vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a strong candidate because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which can help me quickly identify which vowels are present
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which are frequently used in English words

This should give me good information about which vowels are in the word and their possible positions, as well as whether R or S are present.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E somewhere (but not in the 5th position)
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S
- Has 5 distinct letters (since all four letters in AROSE were eliminated)

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes E (but E cannot be in position 5)
2. Excludes A, R, O, S
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out)

Let me try a word with E, I, U, and common consonants. ""UNTIE"" is a good candidate:
- Contains E and I (two new vowels)
- Contains T and N (common consonants)
- Does not contain A, R, O, S
- E is in position 4, so if it's still wrong-positioned, we'll know it must be in 1, 2, or 3

This should give us new vowel positions and test other consonants.

So far the pattern is: _ _ _ I _

We still need three more letters, all of which must come from the unused alphabet (excluding A, R, O, S, U, N, T).

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y
Remaining vowels: E (already confirmed), plus possibly none (since A, O, U are out).

We need a word that:
- Has I fixed in the 4th position.
- Uses E in one of the first three positions.
- Uses two other consonants from the allowed set.

Let’s try to pick a word that introduces new consonants and tests E in a different spot. A good candidate is “BIDGE”:
- B, D, G are new consonants.
- E is in the 3rd position (testing that spot).

- E is in the 3rd position (testing that spot).
- I is in the 4th (confirmed).
- The word must be valid.

This should give us information about E’s placement and the new consonants B, D, G.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(✓) E(-)
Guess 3: BIDGE -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(-) D(x) G(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on BIDGE:

1. B(x) – B is not in the word.
2. I(-) – I is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (it was correct in the 4th, so this is consistent with being in 4th only).
3. D(x) – D is not in the word.
4. G(x) – G is not in the word.
5. E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in the 5th position (it was wrong in 5th, 3rd, and 1st in previous guesses, so E must be in 2nd position).

So far we know:

- Pattern: _ E _ I _
- Forbidden letters: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, B, D, G
- Allowed letters: C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, plus E (already placed) and I (already placed).

We need two more consonants from the allowed set. Let’s pick common ones: C and L.

Candidate word: C E L I C

Check:
- 5 letters, valid English word.
- Uses C and L (new consonants), E in 2nd (now confirmed correct), I in 4th (confirmed correct).
- No forbidden letters.

This should confirm positions for C and L while testing E in 2nd.

Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(✓) E(-)

Guess 4: CELIC -> FEEDBACK: C(x) E(✓) L(✓) I(✓) C(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback on CELIC:

- C(x) – C is NOT in the word (first and last letters).
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).
- L(✓) – L is in the word and in the correct position (3rd).
- I(✓) – I is in the word and in the correct position (4th).
- C(x) – C is NOT in the word (last letter).

So the confirmed pattern is: _ E L I _

Letters still allowed: any letter not in the forbidden list (A, R, O, S, U, N, T, B, D, G, C).

Remaining common consonants: F, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

We need the first and fifth letters. Since the word must be valid, let’s try common first consonants:

Possible first letters: F, H, K, M, P, W, Y.

Let’s test a word that fits: F E L I K (but “FELIK” isn’t valid).  
Next: P E L I K (invalid).  
H E L I X (invalid).  
M E L I K (invalid).  
P E L I X (invalid).  
F E L I M (invalid).  
H E L I M (invalid).  
K E L I M (invalid).  
W E L I X (invalid).

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words matching _ E L I _:

- FELIX (but F and X: X isn’t confirmed yet)
- HELIX (H and X)
- PELIX (invalid)
- MELIX (invalid)
- VELIX (invalid)

Looking at valid English words: “FELIX” is valid (though sometimes spelled “FELIX”), but we can use it.  
Another valid word: “HELIX”.

Both use new letters. Let’s pick HELIX to test H and X.

But X is less common; let’s see if there’s a better fit.  
Another valid word: “MELON” – but N is forbidden.  
“PELIC” – invalid.  
“VELIX” – invalid.

“FELIX” is valid and uses F and X. Let’s go with that.

Final check: F, E, L, I, X – none are forbidden, and positions match.

So the guess is FELIX.
