### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess with no prior feedback, I should choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination covers 5 different letters, including 2 vowels and 3 consonants, which should provide good coverage for eliminating or confirming letters in subsequent guesses.

Let’s pick a word that introduces new common letters. Good consonants left include R, N, C, D, M, etc. Vowels left are I, O, U. Let’s try a word that uses R, N, and one more vowel.

A good candidate is ""EARLY"":

  - Possible words: ARISE (but R and S are eliminated), AMIDE (M, I, D allowed), etc.

- If A is in 4: _ _ _ A _
  - E must be in 2 or 3
  - Possible words: MACEA (but C, M allowed), etc.

- If A is in 5: _ _ _ _ A
  - E must be in 2 or 3
  - Possible words: MELON (but L and O are allowed? Wait, L is eliminated), etc.

Looking at remaining letters, let’s try ""MEDIA"":
- Contains M, E, D, I, A
- Eliminated letters: S, L, T, R, Y → none of these are in MEDIA
- A is in position 5 (allowed)
- E is in position 2 (allowed)

 MEDIA seems to fit all constraints.

From the new feedback on MEDIA:

- M(✓) → M is in the word and in position 1.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 2.
- D(x) → D is not in the word.
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in the word and in position 5.

So the word looks like: M E _ _ A

Letters already eliminated: S, L, T, R, Y, D, I

Remaining letters that are still possible: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need to fill positions 3 and 4 with two different letters from the remaining set.

Looking for common 5-letter words that start with ME and end with A, with no S, L, T, R, Y, D, I:

Possible patterns: M E _ _ A

Common words that fit:
- MECCA (but C is allowed, but C is in position 4, which is allowed)
- MEGNA (not a valid word)
- MELBA (but L is eliminated)
- MEENA (but N is allowed, but E is already used twice - but MEENA has E in position 4 which is allowed)
- MEGMA (not a valid word)
- MECHA (but C and H are allowed)

MECCA seems like the most common valid word fitting these constraints.

Let's verify:
- MECCA: M E C C A
- Letters: M, E, C, C, A
- C is not eliminated (eliminated letters: S, L, T, R, Y, D, I)
- No duplicates except C which is allowed
- Positions: M(1), E(2), C(3), C(4), A(5) - all match the constraints

Therefore, MECCA is a valid next guess.
