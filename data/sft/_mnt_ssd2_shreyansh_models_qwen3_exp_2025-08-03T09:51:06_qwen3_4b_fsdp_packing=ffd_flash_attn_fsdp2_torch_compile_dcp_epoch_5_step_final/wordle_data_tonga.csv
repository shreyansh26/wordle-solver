### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words, so the feedback will likely reveal a lot
- It has no repeated letters, which helps maximize information gain

This will give me good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all  
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3  
- S(x) → S is not in the word  
- E(x) → E is not in the word  

So the secret word:
- Contains the letters A and O (but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively)
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are confirmed, E is out)

I want a new word that uses A and O in different positions, avoids R/S/E, and introduces new common consonants.  
A word like “POINT” would use P, O, I, N, T – but it lacks A.  
A word like “LAUGH” would use A, but O is missing.  
A word like “CLOUD” would use O, but A is missing.  
A word like “PAINT” uses A and O? No, it only has A.  
A word like “COATI” is invalid (not a recognized word).  
A word like “MOUNT” uses O but not A.  
A word like “PLAID” uses A but not O.  
A word like “PAULI” is invalid.  
A word like “FOCAL” uses O and A (O in 2nd, A in 4th), and introduces F, C, L.  

“FOCAL” seems valid and uses both A and O in new positions while adding new consonants.

From the two rounds of feedback:

   - A is in the word, but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in focal and marked (-)).
   - F, C, L are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ _
- Letters definitely present: A, O
- Letters definitely absent: R, S, E, F, C, L

- Has O in position 2
- Contains A somewhere except position 1 or 4
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Remaining common consonants: T, N, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U (A and O already confirmed)

Possible positions for A:
- Position 3 or 5 (since it can't be 1 or 4)

Examples:
- ""BOAST"" – but S is ruled out.
- ""NOAA_"" – but double A might be unlikely.
- ""GOATE"" – E is ruled out.
- ""DOING"" – I is possible, but G and N are fine.
- ""POINT"" – I and N are fine, but O is already in position 2.

Wait, ""POINT"" has O in position 2, but it doesn't have A. We need a word with A.

Let's think of words with O in position 2 and A in position 3 or 5:
- ""BOAST"" – S is out.
- ""GOATE"" – E is out.
- ""NOAA_"" – not a valid word.
- ""DOING"" – no A.
- ""HOAGY"" – Y is possible, but not common.
- ""POACH"" – C is out.
- ""MOCHA"" – C is out.
- ""BOGUS"" – S is out.
- ""DOUGH"" – no A.

Another approach: A in position 3:

Possible words:
- ""COAST"" – C and S are possible, but C is out, S is out.
- ""GOALS"" – S is out.
- ""HOAGY"" – Y is possible, but let's see.

A in position 5:

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words, so the feedback will likely reveal a lot
- It has no repeated letters, which helps maximize information gain

This will give me good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all  
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3  
- S(x) → S is not in the word  
- E(x) → E is not in the word  

So the secret word:
- Contains the letters A and O (but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively)
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are confirmed, E is out)

I want a new word that uses A and O in different positions, avoids R/S/E, and introduces new common consonants.  
A word like “POINT” would use P, O, I, N, T – but it lacks A.  
A word like “LAUGH” would use A, but O is missing.  
A word like “CLOUD” would use O, but A is missing.  
A word like “PAINT” uses A and O? No, it only has A.  
A word like “COATI” is invalid (not a recognized word).  
A word like “MOUNT” uses O but not A.  
A word like “PLAID” uses A but not O.  
A word like “PAULI” is invalid.  
A word like “FOCAL” uses O and A (O in 2nd, A in 4th), and introduces F, C, L.  

“FOCAL” seems valid and uses both A and O in new positions while adding new consonants.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word, but not in position 1.
   - O is in the word, but not in position 3.
   - R, S, E are not in the word.

2. focal → F(x) O(✓) C(x) A(-) L(x)
   - O is in position 2 (✓), so the word looks like _ O _ _ _
   - A is in the word, but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in focal and marked (-)).
   - F, C, L are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ _
- Letters definitely present: A, O
- Letters definitely absent: R, S, E, F, C, L

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Contains A somewhere except position 1 or 4
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Remaining common consonants: T, N, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U (A and O already confirmed)

Possible positions for A:
- Position 3 or 5 (since it can't be 1 or 4)

Let's try to form a word:
- _ O _ _ _ with A in position 3 or 5

Examples:
- ""BOAST"" – but S is ruled out.
- ""NOAA_"" – but double A might be unlikely.
- ""GOATE"" – E is ruled out.
- ""DOING"" – I is possible, but G and N are fine.
- ""POINT"" – I and N are fine, but O is already in position 2.

Wait, ""POINT"" has O in position 2, but it doesn't have A. We need a word with A.

Let's think of words with O in position 2 and A in position 3 or 5:
- ""BOAST"" – S is out.
- ""GOATE"" – E is out.
- ""NOAA_"" – not a valid word.
- ""DOING"" – no A.
- ""HOAGY"" – Y is possible, but not common.
- ""POACH"" – C is out.
- ""MOCHA"" – C is out.
- ""BOGUS"" – S is out.
- ""DOUGH"" – no A.
- ""HOAGY"" – Y is possible, but let's think of better options.

Another approach: A in position 3:
- _ O A _ _
Possible words:
- ""COAST"" – C and S are possible, but C is out, S is out.
- ""GOALS"" – S is out.
- ""HOAGY"" – Y is possible, but let's see.

A in position 5:
- _ O _ _ A
Possible words:
- ""NOISE"" – E is out.
- ""POISE"" – E is out.
- ""DOING"" – no A.
- ""HOIST"" – S and T are possible, but S is out.
- ""BOGUS"" – S is out.
- ""MOATS"" – S is out.
- ""GOATS"" – S is out.
- ""DOUGH"" – no A.

Hmm, let's list remaining letters: A, O are confirmed; others not ruled out: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word with O in position 2 and A in position 3 or 5.

Possible valid words:
- ""BOAST"" – S is out.
- ""GOATE"" – E is out.
- ""DOING"" – no A.
- ""HOAGY"" – Y is possible, but let's see.
- ""NOAA_"" – invalid.
- ""POACH"" – C is out.
- ""MOCHA"" – C is out.
- ""BOGUS"" – S is out.
- ""HOAGY"" – seems possible, but let's think of better.

Wait, ""HOAGY"" is valid but uncommon. Let's think of ""HOAGY"" or ""DOING"" but ""DOING"" lacks A.

Another word: ""HOAGY"" has H, O, A, G, Y – all allowed letters (H, G, Y not ruled out). It fits _ O A _ _ pattern with A in position 3.

But let's think of more common words. ""POINT"" lacks A.

Wait, ""POINT"" has O in position 2, but no A. We need A.

Let me try ""HOAGY"" as it seems to fit all constraints:
- O in position 2 (✓)
- A in position 3 (allowed, since A is not in position 1 or 4)
- Letters used: H, O, A, G, Y – none are ruled out.

This seems the best fit.

- ""DOUGH"" – no A.
- ""HOAGY"" – Y is possible, but let's think of better options.

Another approach: A in position 3:
- _ O A _ _
Possible words:
- ""COAST"" – C and S are possible, but C is out, S is out.
- ""GOALS"" – S is out.
- ""HOAGY"" – Y is possible, but let's see.

A in position 5:
- _ O _ _ A
Possible words:
- ""NOISE"" – E is out.
- ""POISE"" – E is out.
- ""DOING"" – no A.
- ""HOIST"" – S and T are possible, but S is out.
- ""BOGUS"" – S is out.
- ""MOATS"" – S is out.
- ""GOATS"" – S is out.
- ""DOUGH"" – no A.

Hmm, let's list remaining letters: A, O are confirmed; others not ruled out: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word with O in position 2 and A in position 3 or 5.

Possible valid words:
- ""BOAST"" – S is out.
- ""GOATE"" – E is out.
- ""DOING"" – no A.
- ""HOAGY"" – Y is possible, but let's see.
- ""NOAA_"" – invalid.
- ""POACH"" – C is out.
- ""MOCHA"" – C is out.
- ""BOGUS"" – S is out.
- ""HOAGY"" – seems possible, but let's think of better.

Wait, ""HOAGY"" is valid but uncommon. Let's think of ""HOAGY"" or ""DOING"" but ""DOING"" lacks A.

Another word: ""HOAGY"" has H, O, A, G, Y – all allowed letters (H, G, Y not ruled out). It fits _ O A _ _ pattern with A in position 3.

But let's think of more common words. ""POINT"" lacks A.

Wait, ""POINT"" has O in position 2, but no A. We need A.

Let me try ""HOAGY"" as it seems to fit all constraints:
- O in position 2 (✓)
- A in position 3 (allowed, since A is not in position 1 or 4)
- Letters used: H, O, A, G, Y – none are ruled out.

This seems the best fit.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - R, S, E are not in the word.

2. focal → F(x) O(✓) C(x) A(-) L(x)
   - O is in position 2 (✓).
   - A is in the word but not in position 4.
   - F, C, L are not in the word.

3. hoagy → H(x) O(✓) A(-) G(✓) Y(x)
   - O is in position 2 (✓) – consistent.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in hoagy and marked (-)).
   - G is in the word and in position 4 (✓).
   - H and Y are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ O _ G _
- Letters definitely present: A, O, G
- Letters definitely absent: R, S, E, F, C, L, H, Y
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 → only possible in position 5.

So the word must be _ O _ G A.

Remaining valid letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, I, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that fits _ O _ G A.

Possible words:
- BOGGA – not valid.
- DOGMA – D, O, G, M, A – all allowed letters.
- FOGLA – F is out.
- LOGIA – L is out.
- MOGGA – not valid.
- NOGAS – S is out.
- POGAS – S is out.
- TOGAE – E is out.
- VOGLA – V, O, G, L, A – L is out.
- WOGAN – W, O, G, A, N – all allowed letters.

Between DOGMA and WOGAN, DOGMA is more common.

Let's choose DOGMA.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.). 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear in many 5-letter words, so the feedback will likely reveal a lot
- It has no repeated letters, which helps maximize information gain

This will give me good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 1  
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all  
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3  
- S(x) → S is not in the word  
- E(x) → E is not in the word  

So the secret word:
- Contains the letters A and O (but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively)
- Does NOT contain R, S, or E

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.  
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and O are confirmed, E is out)

I want a new word that uses A and O in different positions, avoids R/S/E, and introduces new common consonants.  
A word like “POINT” would use P, O, I, N, T – but it lacks A.  
A word like “LAUGH” would use A, but O is missing.  
A word like “CLOUD” would use O, but A is missing.  
A word like “PAINT” uses A and O? No, it only has A.  
A word like “COATI” is invalid (not a recognized word).  
A word like “MOUNT” uses O but not A.  
A word like “PLAID” uses A but not O.  
A word like “PAULI” is invalid.  
A word like “FOCAL” uses O and A (O in 2nd, A in 4th), and introduces F, C, L.  

“FOCAL” seems valid and uses both A and O in new positions while adding new consonants.

   - F, C, L are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ _
- Letters definitely present: A, O
- Letters definitely absent: R, S, E, F, C, L

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2
- Contains A somewhere except position 1 or 4
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Remaining common consonants: T, N, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U (A and O already confirmed)

Possible positions for A:
- Position 3 or 5 (since it can't be 1 or 4)

Let's try to form a word:
- _ O _ _ _ with A in position 3 or 5

Examples:
- ""BOAST"" – but S is ruled out.
- ""NOAA_"" – but double A might be unlikely.
- ""GOATE"" – E is ruled out.
- ""DOING"" – I is possible, but G and N are fine.
- ""POINT"" – I and N are fine, but O is already in position 2.

Wait, ""POINT"" has O in position 2, but it doesn't have A. We need a word with A.

Let's think of words with O in position 2 and A in position 3 or 5:
- ""BOAST"" – S is out.
- ""GOATE"" – E is out.
- ""NOAA_"" – not a valid word.
- ""DOING"" – no A.
- ""HOAGY"" – Y is possible, but not common.
- ""POACH"" – C is out.
- ""MOCHA"" – C is out.
- ""BOGUS"" – S is out.
- ""DOUGH"" – no A.
- ""HOAGY"" – Y is possible, but let's think of better options.

Another approach: A in position 3:
- _ O A _ _
Possible words:
- ""COAST"" – C and S are possible, but C is out, S is out.
- ""GOALS"" – S is out.
- ""HOAGY"" – Y is possible, but let's see.

A in position 5:
- _ O _ _ A
Possible words:
- ""NOISE"" – E is out.
- ""POISE"" – E is out.
- ""DOING"" – no A.
- ""HOIST"" – S and T are possible, but S is out.
- ""BOGUS"" – S is out.
- ""MOATS"" – S is out.
- ""GOATS"" – S is out.
- ""DOUGH"" – no A.

Hmm, let's list remaining letters: A, O are confirmed; others not ruled out: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word with O in position 2 and A in position 3 or 5.

Possible valid words:
- ""BOAST"" – S is out.
- ""GOATE"" – E is out.
- ""DOING"" – no A.
- ""HOAGY"" – Y is possible, but let's see.
- ""NOAA_"" – invalid.
- ""POACH"" – C is out.
- ""MOCHA"" – C is out.
- ""BOGUS"" – S is out.
- ""HOAGY"" – seems possible, but let's think of better.

Wait, ""HOAGY"" is valid but uncommon. Let's think of ""HOAGY"" or ""DOING"" but ""DOING"" lacks A.

Another word: ""HOAGY"" has H, O, A, G, Y – all allowed letters (H, G, Y not ruled out). It fits _ O A _ _ pattern with A in position 3.

But let's think of more common words. ""POINT"" lacks A.

Wait, ""POINT"" has O in position 2, but no A. We need A.

Let me try ""HOAGY"" as it seems to fit all constraints:
- O in position 2 (✓)
- A in position 3 (allowed, since A is not in position 1 or 4)
- Letters used: H, O, A, G, Y – none are ruled out.

This seems the best fit.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the three rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - R, S, E are not in the word.

2. focal → F(x) O(✓) C(x) A(-) L(x)
   - O is in position 2 (✓).
   - A is in the word but not in position 4.
   - F, C, L are not in the word.

3. hoagy → H(x) O(✓) A(-) G(✓) Y(x)
   - O is in position 2 (✓) – consistent.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in hoagy and marked (-)).
   - G is in the word and in position 4 (✓).
   - H and Y are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ O _ G _
- Letters definitely present: A, O, G
- Letters definitely absent: R, S, E, F, C, L, H, Y
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 4 → only possible in position 5.

So the word must be _ O _ G A.

Remaining valid letters (not yet ruled out): B, D, I, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that fits _ O _ G A.

Possible words:
- BOGGA – not valid.
- DOGMA – D, O, G, M, A – all allowed letters.
- FOGLA – F is out.
- LOGIA – L is out.
- MOGGA – not valid.
- NOGAS – S is out.
- POGAS – S is out.
- TOGAE – E is out.
- VOGLA – V, O, G, L, A – L is out.
- WOGAN – W, O, G, A, N – all allowed letters.

Between DOGMA and WOGAN, DOGMA is more common.

Let's choose DOGMA.

From the four rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - R, S, E are not in the word.

2. focal → F(x) O(✓) C(x) A(-) L(x)
   - O is in position 2 (✓).
   - A is in the word but not in position 4.
   - F, C, L are not in the word.

3. hoagy → H(x) O(✓) A(-) G(✓) Y(x)
   - O is in position 2 (✓) – consistent.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in hoagy and marked (-)).
   - G is in the word and in position 4 (✓).
   - H and Y are not in the word.

4. dogma → D(x) O(✓) G(-) M(x) A(✓)
   - O is in position 2 (✓) – consistent.
   - A is in the word and in position 5 (✓).
   - G is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in dogma and marked (-)).
   - D and M are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ A (A is in position 5)
- G is in the word but not in position 4 → G must be in position 1, 2, or 3. However, position 2 is O, so G must be in position 1 or 3.
- A is in position 5 (from dogma feedback).
- O is in position 2 (from focal and hoagy feedback).
- Letters definitely absent: R, S, E, F, C, L, H, Y, D, M.

So the word looks like:
- G O _ _ A (G in position 1)
- _ O G _ A (G in position 3)

Possible words:
- G O _ _ A: Need two letters in positions 3 and 4 from remaining valid letters (B, I, K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z).
  - GOBIA – valid word.
  - GONIA – valid (plural of gonion).
  - GONAD – D is out.
  - GOGAE – E is out.
  - GOIPA – not valid.
  - GOULA – L is out.
  - GOVAN – valid.
  - GOVIA – not valid.
  - GOWAN – valid.
  - GOWAN is less common, GOBIA is more common.

- _ O G _ A: Need two letters in positions 1 and 4 from remaining valid letters.
  - B O G _ A: BOGSA – S is out. BOGGA – valid but G is in position 3 here.
  - P O G _ A: POGBA – not valid.
  - N O G _ A: NOGAS – S is out.
  - V O G _ A: VOGLA – L is out.
  - W O G _ A: WOGAN – valid.

Between G O _ _ A and _ O G _ A, G O B I A and W O G A N are both valid. GOBIA is more common.

Let's choose GOBIA.

From the five rounds of feedback:

   - H and Y are not in the word.

   - A is in the word and in position 5 (✓).
   - G is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in dogma and marked (-)).
   - D and M are not in the word.

5. gobia → G(-) O(✓) B(x) I(x) A(✓)
   - O is in position 2 (✓) – consistent.
   - A is in the word and in position 5 (✓) – consistent.
   - G is in the word but not in position 1 (since it was in position 1 in gobia and marked (-)).
   - B and I are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ A
- G is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 4 (from hoagy, dogma, gobia feedback). The only remaining position for G is position 2, but position 2 is O. This is a contradiction unless G is allowed in position 2, but O is already there. This suggests an error in previous reasoning.

Wait, let's re-examine:
- From hoagy: G is in position 4 (✓) – so G must be in position 4.
- From dogma: G is in the word but not in position 4 (marked (-)), which contradicts hoagy's feedback. This indicates a mistake in interpreting the feedback.

Looking back:
- Guess 3: hoagy → H(x) O(✓) A(-) G(✓) Y(x)
  - G(✓) means G is in the word and in position 4 (✓).

- Guess 4: dogma → D(x) O(✓) G(-) M(x) A(✓)
  - G(-) means G is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in dogma and marked (-)).

This is a direct contradiction. The only way this can happen is if G is in the word but not in position 4 (from dogma) and also in position 4 (from hoagy), which is impossible. This suggests an inconsistency in the feedback provided, but since we must proceed, the most plausible resolution is that the feedback from dogma indicates G is not in position 4, overriding the previous ✓ from hoagy. This would mean the initial interpretation of hoagy's G(✓) was correct (G in position 4), and dogma's G(-) indicates G is not in position 4, which is impossible. This implies the word must have G in position 4, and the feedback from dogma must have been mis-typed or misinterpreted.

Re-evaluating:
- The feedback from hoagy clearly shows G in position 4 (✓).
- The feedback from dogma shows G in position 3 (-), meaning G is in the word but not in position 3.
- The feedback from gobia shows G in position 1 (-), meaning G is in the word but not in position 1.

Thus, G must be in position 4 (from hoagy), and cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from gobia and dogma). This is consistent, as position 4 is allowed.

So the pattern is: _ O _ G A

Letters definitely absent: R, S, E, F, C, L, H, Y, D, M, B, I.

Remaining valid letters: A, O, G are confirmed; others not ruled out: K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with pattern _ O _ G A.

Possible words:
- K O N G A – valid word ""konga"" (a type of drum)

<guess>konga</guess>",konga,"From the five rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.
   - R, S, E are not in the word.

2. focal → F(x) O(✓) C(x) A(-) L(x)
   - O is in position 2 (✓).
   - A is in the word but not in position 4.
   - F, C, L are not in the word.

3. hoagy → H(x) O(✓) A(-) G(✓) Y(x)
   - O is in position 2 (✓) – consistent.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in hoagy and marked (-)).
   - G is in the word and in position 4 (✓).
   - H and Y are not in the word.

4. dogma → D(x) O(✓) G(-) M(x) A(✓)
   - O is in position 2 (✓) – consistent.
   - A is in the word and in position 5 (✓).
   - G is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in dogma and marked (-)).
   - D and M are not in the word.

5. gobia → G(-) O(✓) B(x) I(x) A(✓)
   - O is in position 2 (✓) – consistent.
   - A is in the word and in position 5 (✓) – consistent.
   - G is in the word but not in position 1 (since it was in position 1 in gobia and marked (-)).
   - B and I are not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ A
- G is in the word but not in positions 1, 3, 4 (from hoagy, dogma, gobia feedback). The only remaining position for G is position 2, but position 2 is O. This is a contradiction unless G is allowed in position 2, but O is already there. This suggests an error in previous reasoning.

Wait, let's re-examine:
- From hoagy: G is in position 4 (✓) – so G must be in position 4.
- From dogma: G is in the word but not in position 4 (marked (-)), which contradicts hoagy's feedback. This indicates a mistake in interpreting the feedback.

Looking back:
- Guess 3: hoagy → H(x) O(✓) A(-) G(✓) Y(x)
  - G(✓) means G is in the word and in position 4 (✓).

- Guess 4: dogma → D(x) O(✓) G(-) M(x) A(✓)
  - G(-) means G is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in dogma and marked (-)).

This is a direct contradiction. The only way this can happen is if G is in the word but not in position 4 (from dogma) and also in position 4 (from hoagy), which is impossible. This suggests an inconsistency in the feedback provided, but since we must proceed, the most plausible resolution is that the feedback from dogma indicates G is not in position 4, overriding the previous ✓ from hoagy. This would mean the initial interpretation of hoagy's G(✓) was correct (G in position 4), and dogma's G(-) indicates G is not in position 4, which is impossible. This implies the word must have G in position 4, and the feedback from dogma must have been mis-typed or misinterpreted.

Re-evaluating:
- The feedback from hoagy clearly shows G in position 4 (✓).
- The feedback from dogma shows G in position 3 (-), meaning G is in the word but not in position 3.
- The feedback from gobia shows G in position 1 (-), meaning G is in the word but not in position 1.

Thus, G must be in position 4 (from hoagy), and cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from gobia and dogma). This is consistent, as position 4 is allowed.

So the pattern is: _ O _ G A

Letters definitely absent: R, S, E, F, C, L, H, Y, D, M, B, I.

Remaining valid letters: A, O, G are confirmed; others not ruled out: K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with pattern _ O _ G A.

Possible words:
- K O N G A – valid word ""konga"" (a type of drum)
- P O N G A – not valid.
- T O N G A – valid word ""tonga"" (a type of traditional Hawaiian society)
- V O N G A – not valid.
- W O N G A – not valid.
- N O K G A – not valid.
- N O T G A – not valid.
- P O K G A – not valid.
- T O K G A – not valid.
