For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of these common letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This will help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: A, S

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and S (but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively).
2. Does NOT contain R, O, or E.
3. Has 5 letters total.

Common consonants left to try: T, L, N, C, D, P, M, etc.
Common vowels left to try: I, U (since A is already confirmed and E, O are out).

A good next guess should place A and S in new positions while introducing new common letters. A word like “SAINT” comes to mind, but it has S in position 1 (same as original S position 4) which might not be helpful. Instead, let’s try “STAIN” – S in position 1 (same as original), A in position 2 (original was position 1), I and N are new letters. However, S in position 1 is the same as original position 4, which might not give us new info. 

A better choice is “SAUCY” – but C and U are new, and S and A are in new positions (S in 1, A in 2 vs original 1 and 4). 

Alternatively, “STASH” – but H is new, S is in position 1 (same as original 4), A is in position 2 (original 1). 

Another option is “SLAIN” – S in 1, A in 3 (new), L and I are new. 

After considering, “SLAIN” seems good because it moves A to position 3 and introduces L, I, N while keeping S in position 1 (same as original 4). But since S was in position 4 and is now in 1, that’s a new position. 

Wait, let’s pick “SAINT” – S in 1 (original 4), A in 2 (original 1), I and N are new. This seems optimal as it tests new letters while repositioning A and S.

But looking back, the original A was in position 1 (now position 2) and S was in position 4 (now position 1). This should give us new placement info for both A and S. 

However, to maximize new information, maybe “STAIN” is better as it introduces I and N. 

After careful consideration, “STAIN” seems the best next guess: S in 1 (original 4), T new, A in 2 (original 1), I new, N new.

From the new feedback on “stain”:
- S(✓) – S is in the word AND in the correct position (position 1).
- T(-) – T is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- I(x) – I is NOT in the word.
- N(x) – N is NOT in the word.

So we now know:
- The word starts with S.
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, I, N.
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: T, A (they must appear somewhere else besides positions 4 and 3 respectively).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Contains T and A somewhere besides positions 4 and 3.
3. Does NOT contain R, O, E, I, N.

Remaining common letters to try: C, D, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Possible positions for T and A:
- T cannot be in position 2 (since it was in position 2 in stain and marked wrong position).
- A cannot be in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in stain and marked wrong position).

Let’s try to place T and A in remaining spots. A good candidate is “SCOUT”:
- Starts with S.
- Contains T and A.
- T would be in position 5 (new), A would be in position 3 (but this is disallowed since A was wrong in position 3). So this is invalid.

Next candidate: “SATAY” – but Y is allowed, but A appears twice and we already know A is in the word once. Also, A in position 2 is new.

But SATAY has A in position 2 and 4. Since A was wrong in position 3, position 2 is fine, but position 4 is new. However, SATAY has A in 4 which is new. But we need to check if letters are allowed: S, A, T, A, Y. Allowed letters: S (known), T (known), A (known), Y (new), others excluded (R,O,E,I,N). This seems valid.

But SATAY has A in position 4 which is new. However, we need to ensure T is not in position 2 (which it isn’t). This seems acceptable.

Another candidate: “SATYA” – similar issue.

Better: “STAMP” – but P and M are new, but A is in position 2 (new), T in position 2 (original was position 2, but T was marked wrong position in stain, so position 2 is invalid for T). So STAMP is invalid.

Next: “SALTY” – A in position 2 (new), T in position 3 (original was position 2, so new), L and Y are new. This seems valid.

But we need to check if T is allowed in position 3 – yes, since T was in position 2 in stain and marked wrong position, so positions 1,3,4,5 are possible for T. Similarly, A was in position 3 in stain and marked wrong position, so positions 1,2,4,5 are possible for A. In SALTY, A is in position 2 (new), T in position 3 (new). This seems optimal.

But SALTY has L and Y which are new letters. This will help us test new letters while repositioning T and A.

Another candidate: “SALSA” – but S is repeated and A appears twice. Also, S is already known.

Best seems SALTY.

But let me think of another: “SATCH” – but C and H are new, T in position 3 (new), A in position 2 (new). This is also valid.

Between SALTY and SATCH, SALTY uses more common letters (L, Y are okay). Let’s go with SALTY.

However, let me double-check:
- S(✓) – position 1 correct.
- T(-) – T is in the word but wrong position (in SALTY, T is in position 3, which is new).
- A(-) – A is in the word but wrong position (in SALTY, A is in position 2, which is new).
- No R, O, E, I, N.
- Uses new letters L, Y.

Yes, SALTY is valid.

But wait, in SALTY:
- Letters: S, A, L, T, Y
- T is in position 3 (original was 2) – new position.
- A is in position 2 (original was 3) – new position.
This satisfies all constraints.

Thus, the next guess is SALTY.

- S(✓) – S is in the word AND in the correct position (position 1).
- T(-) – T is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- I(x) – I is NOT in the word.
- N(x) – N is NOT in the word.

So we now know:
- The word starts with S.
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, I, N.
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: T, A (they must appear somewhere else besides positions 4 and 3 respectively).

But we need to check if letters are allowed: S, A, T, A, Y. Allowed letters: S (known), T (known), A (known), Y (new), others excluded (R,O,E,I,N). This seems valid.

But SATAY has A in position 4 which is new. However, we need to ensure T is not in position 2 (which it isn’t). This seems acceptable.

Another candidate: “SATYA” – similar issue.

Better: “STAMP” – but P and M are new, but A is in position 2 (new), T in position 2 (original was position 2, but T was marked wrong position in stain, so position 2 is invalid for T). So STAMP is invalid.

Next: “SALTY” – A in position 2 (new), T in position 3 (original was position 2, so new), L and Y are new. This seems valid.

But we need to check if T is allowed in position 3 – yes, since T was in position 2 in stain and marked wrong position, so positions 1,3,4,5 are possible for T. Similarly, A was in position 3 in stain and marked wrong position, so positions 1,2,4,5 are possible for A. In SALTY, A is in position 2 (new), T in position 3 (new). This seems optimal.

But SALTY has L and Y which are new letters. This will help us test new letters while repositioning T and A.

Another candidate: “SALSA” – but S is repeated and A appears twice. Also, S is already known.

Best seems SALTY.

But let me think of another: “SATCH” – but C and H are new, T in position 3 (new), A in position 2 (new). This is also valid.

Between SALTY and SATCH, SALTY uses more common letters (L, Y are okay). Let’s go with SALTY.

However, let me double-check:
- S(✓) – position 1 correct.
- T(-) – T is in the word but wrong position (in SALTY, T is in position 3, which is new).
- A(-) – A is in the word but wrong position (in SALTY, A is in position 2, which is new).
- No R, O, E, I, N.
- Uses new letters L, Y.

Yes, SALTY is valid.

But wait, in SALTY:
- Letters: S, A, L, T, Y
- T is in position 3 (original was 2) – new position.
- A is in position 2 (original was 3) – new position.
This satisfies all constraints.

Thus, the next guess is SALTY.",Guess 3: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(-) L(x) T(-) Y(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good strategy is to use a word with a mix of these common letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This will help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(x) – R is NOT in the word.
- O(x) – O is NOT in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position.
- E(x) – E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: A, S

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A and S (but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively).
2. Does NOT contain R, O, or E.
3. Has 5 letters total.

Common consonants left to try: T, L, N, C, D, P, M, etc.
Common vowels left to try: I, U (since A is already confirmed and E, O are out).

A good next guess should place A and S in new positions while introducing new common letters. A word like “SAINT” comes to mind, but it has S in position 1 (same as original S position 4) which might not be helpful. Instead, let’s try “STAIN” – S in position 1 (same as original), A in position 2 (original was position 1), I and N are new letters. However, S in position 1 is the same as original position 4, which might not give us new info. 

A better choice is “SAUCY” – but C and U are new, and S and A are in new positions (S in 1, A in 2 vs original 1 and 4). 

Alternatively, “STASH” – but H is new, S is in position 1 (same as original 4), A is in position 2 (original 1). 

Another option is “SLAIN” – S in 1, A in 3 (new), L and I are new. 

After considering, “SLAIN” seems good because it moves A to position 3 and introduces L, I, N while keeping S in position 1 (same as original 4). But since S was in position 4 and is now in 1, that’s a new position. 

Wait, let’s pick “SAINT” – S in 1 (original 4), A in 2 (original 1), I and N are new. This seems optimal as it tests new letters while repositioning A and S.

But looking back, the original A was in position 1 (now position 2) and S was in position 4 (now position 1). This should give us new placement info for both A and S. 

However, to maximize new information, maybe “STAIN” is better as it introduces I and N. 

After careful consideration, “STAIN” seems the best next guess: S in 1 (original 4), T new, A in 2 (original 1), I new, N new.

From the new feedback on “stain”:
- S(✓) – S is in the word AND in the correct position (position 1).
- T(-) – T is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- I(x) – I is NOT in the word.
- N(x) – N is NOT in the word.

So we now know:
- The word starts with S.
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, I, N.
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: T, A (they must appear somewhere else besides positions 4 and 3 respectively).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Contains T and A somewhere besides positions 4 and 3.
3. Does NOT contain R, O, E, I, N.

Remaining common letters to try: C, D, L, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Possible positions for T and A:
- T cannot be in position 2 (since it was in position 2 in stain and marked wrong position).
- A cannot be in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in stain and marked wrong position).

Let’s try to place T and A in remaining spots. A good candidate is “SCOUT”:
- Starts with S.
- Contains T and A.
- T would be in position 5 (new), A would be in position 3 (but this is disallowed since A was wrong in position 3). So this is invalid.

Next candidate: “SATAY” – but Y is allowed, but A appears twice and we already know A is in the word once. Also, A in position 2 is new.

But SATAY has A in position 2 and 4. Since A was wrong in position 3, position 2 is fine, but position 4 is new. However, SATAY has A in 4 which is new. But we need to check if letters are allowed: S, A, T, A, Y. Allowed letters: S (known), T (known), A (known), Y (new), others excluded (R,O,E,I,N). This seems valid.

Current confirmed facts:
- Word starts with S (position 1).
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, I, N, L, Y.
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown: T, A (they must appear somewhere other than positions 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively).

Remaining usable letters (excluding the forbidden ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Contains both T and A exactly once each.
3. T cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (since it was wrong in all of them in prior guesses). This leaves no possible position for T, which is impossible.

Wait, this suggests an error in my earlier reasoning. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From Guess 2 (stain):
- T(-) means T is in the word but NOT in position 2.

From Guess 3 (salty):
- T(-) again means T is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So T can only be in position 1 or 5. But position 1 is already S, so T must be in position 5.

Similarly, A(-) from stain means A is not in position 3, and from salty means A is not in position 2. So A can be in positions 1, 4, or 5. Position 1 is S, and position 5 is T, so A must be in position 4.

Thus, the word must be of the form: S _ _ A T.

Now we need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters from the remaining pool (excluding R, O, E, I, N, L, Y).

Remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need two distinct letters for positions 2 and 3. Let's look for common 5-letter words that fit S _ _ A T.

Possible candidates:
- SCART – but R is forbidden.
- SCAT? – but we need 5 letters and SCAT is 4.
- S _ _ A T: SCAT is 4, so need 5. SCAPT? Not a word.
- SQUAT – but U is allowed, Q is allowed. SQUAT fits S _ _ A T: S Q U A T.
- S _ _ A T: other options like S H A T? No, needs 5.
- S _ _ A T: S C A T is 4, so need 5. SCAPT? Not valid.
- S _ _ A T: S P A T? No.
- S _ _ A T: S M A T? No.
- SQUAT seems the only valid word here.

Check SQUAT:
- S(✓) position 1.
- Q (new), U (new), A (position 4), T (position 5).
- T is in position 5 (not previously tested for T).
- A is in position 4 (not previously tested for A).
- All letters are allowed (no forbidden letters).

Therefore, SQUAT is the logical next guess.
