2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels and common consonants. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give me good information about the letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must be in positions 2-5).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2, so it must be in positions 1,3-5).
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must be in positions 1-2 or 4-5).
- S and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word contains R, A, I but not S or E. We need a new word that uses these three letters plus two more letters that haven't been tested yet.

Good next guesses would test new common letters like T, N, L, C, etc. while keeping R, A, I in different positions.

- T and N are new letters.
- R moves to position 2 (was position 1).

- It must NOT contain S, E, T, N.
- Positions 1, 2, 3, 4 have each received a “-” for R, A, I, I. Therefore:
  – R cannot be in position 2.
  – A cannot be in position 3.
  – I cannot be in position 4.
  – Also, positions 1, 3, 5 are still possible for R, A, I.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels and common consonants. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should give me good information about the letters in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must be in positions 2-5).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 2, so it must be in positions 1,3-5).
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must be in positions 1-2 or 4-5).
- S and E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word contains R, A, I but not S or E. We need a new word that uses these three letters plus two more letters that haven't been tested yet.

Good next guesses would test new common letters like T, N, L, C, etc. while keeping R, A, I in different positions.

Let's try ""TRAIN"":
- T and N are new letters.
- R moves to position 2 (was position 1).
- A moves to position 3 (was position 2).
- I moves to position 4 (was position 3).
- N is new.

Guess 2: TRAIN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) I(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)
   - R, A, I are in the word but in the wrong positions (positions 1, 2, 3 respectively).
   - S and E are not in the word.

2. TRAIN → T(x) R(-) A(-) I(-) N(x)
   - T and N are not in the word.
   - R, A, I are still in the word but again in the wrong positions (positions 2, 3, 4 respectively).

So far we know:
- The word must contain R, A, I exactly once each.
- It must NOT contain S, E, T, N.
- Positions 1, 2, 3, 4 have each received a “-” for R, A, I, I. Therefore:
  – R cannot be in position 2.
  – A cannot be in position 3.
  – I cannot be in position 4.
  – Also, positions 1, 3, 5 are still possible for R, A, I.

We need a 5-letter word that uses R, A, I once each and two other letters that have not been ruled out (so far allowed letters are B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

A good candidate is “CARIB”:
- It contains C, A, R, I, B (all letters are new except A, R, I).
- Positions:
  – C (new) in 1
  – A (known) in 2
  – R (known) in 3
  – I (known) in 4
  – B (new) in 5

This tests new letters C and B while keeping A, R, I in positions 2, 3, 4 respectively. If any of C or B are marked “x”, we’ll know they’re not in the word and can proceed accordingly.

We only need to find the single missing letter in position 3.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): all letters except S, E, T, N, B, D.

A quick scan of common 5-letter words that fit the pattern C I _ A R gives only one common word:  
**CIAR** + ? → **CIVAR** is not a word, **CIGAR** is valid and uses C, I, G, A, R.

Let’s verify:
- C I G A R
- Letters: C, I, G, A, R – all allowed, no duplicates.
- Positions match all constraints.

Therefore, the correct word must be CIGAR.",Guess 5: CIGAR -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) I(✓) G(✓) A(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
