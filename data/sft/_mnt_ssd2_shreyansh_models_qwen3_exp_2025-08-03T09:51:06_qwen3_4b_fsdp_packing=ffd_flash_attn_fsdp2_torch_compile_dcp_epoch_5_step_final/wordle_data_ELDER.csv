### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- Three common vowels: A, O, E
- Two common consonants: R, S
This combination gives me good coverage to determine which letters might be in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively)
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

A good next guess should:
1. Use R and E in new positions.
2. Introduce other common letters (T, N, L, C, etc.).
3. Avoid A, O, S.

One strong candidate is “RENTS”:
- Uses R and E in new positions (R in 1st, E in 2nd).
- Introduces N and T, which are common.
- Uses S again, but we already know S is not in the word, so this might not be ideal.

Another candidate is “ENTER”:
- Uses E and R in new positions (E in 1st, R in 3rd).
- Introduces N and T.

But “ENTER” uses E twice, which might not be helpful. Instead, let’s try “TREND”:
- T, R, E, N, D – all new letters except R and E.
- R is in position 2 (but we know R is not in position 2 from AROSE feedback), so this might be risky.

A safer choice is “RENAL”:
- R, E, N, A, L – but A is already ruled out.

Let’s go with “ENTER” despite the double E, as it efficiently tests N and T while moving E and R to new positions.

However, since we know S is not in the word, and we want to avoid it, let’s try “TREND”:
- T, R, E, N, D – all new positions for R and E, and introduces T, N, D.

But R in position 2 is still problematic. Let’s instead try “NERDY”:
- N, E, R, D, Y – but Y is less common.

A better choice is “RENTE”:
- R, E, N, T, E – but double E again.

After reconsidering, “ENTER” seems acceptable because:
- E is now in position 1 (not 5).
- R is now in position 3 (not 2).
- N and T are new letters.
- The second E doesn’t waste information since we already know E is in the word.

Thus, “ENTER” is a strong second guess.

- E K _ E R – EK E R? No
- E L D E R – ELDER (but D is in position 3, but ELDER is E L D E R – fits E _ _ E R pattern)
