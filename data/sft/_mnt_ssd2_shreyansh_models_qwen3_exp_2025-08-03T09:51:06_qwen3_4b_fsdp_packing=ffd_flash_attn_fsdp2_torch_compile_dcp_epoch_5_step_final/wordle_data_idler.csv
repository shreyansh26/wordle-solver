### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to gather as much information as possible about the secret word. A good strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels, which can help narrow down possibilities quickly. The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it includes:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This combination maximizes the chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, providing valuable feedback for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on “arose” we know:

- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- O is NOT in the word (x).
- S is NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

- Does NOT contain A, O, or S.
- Contains R (but not in slot 2) and E (but not in slot 5).

To maximize new information, we should:
1. Include the confirmed letters R and E in new positions.
2. Avoid the letters A, O, S.
3. Introduce other common consonants and vowels.

A good next guess is “TREND”:
- T, N, D are common new letters.
- R moves from position 2 to 3.
- E moves from position 5 to 2.
This tests three new letters (T, N, D) while repositioning R and E.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):  
A, O, S, T, N, G, Y

Letters that ARE in the word (confirmed presence, but position unknown):  
R, E, D

Positions to avoid for each:
- R: not in positions 1 or 2
- E: not in positions 2 or 5
- D: not in positions 3 or 5

So far the only letters we have are R, E, D, and we need three more letters that are still allowed. The remaining common letters are B, C, F, H, I, L, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R, E, D.
2. Uses three new letters from the allowed set.
3. Places R, E, D in positions that have not been ruled out.

Possible positions for each:
- R: positions 3, 4, 5 (but 5 is now ruled out for R because in redgy R was in position 1 and got (-), but in trend R was in position 2 and got (-), so R cannot be in 1 or 2. Therefore R must be in 3, 4, or 5. But D cannot be in 5 (from trend), and E cannot be in 5 (from arose), so 5 is ruled out for both, so R must be in 3 or 4.
- E: positions 1, 3, 4 (cannot be 2 or 5)
- D: positions 1, 2, 4 (cannot be 3 or 5)

Let’s try to find a word that satisfies these constraints. One systematic way is to list possible positions for R, E, D and fill the rest with new letters.

Let’s try R in position 3:
- Pattern: _ _ R _ _

Now place E and D:
- E can be 1, 3, 4 (but 3 is R), so 1 or 4.
- D can be 1, 2, 4 (but 4 could be E or D).

Option 1: E in 1, D in 4:
- Pattern: E _ R D _

We need one more letter (position 2) from allowed letters (B, C, F, H, I, L, M, P, U, V, W). Let’s pick a common one like C:
- Word: E C R D _

This is not a valid English word. Let’s try another.

Option 2: D in 1, E in 4:
- Pattern: D _ R E _

Need a letter for position 2. Let’s pick B:
- Word: D B R E _

This is not valid either.

Let’s try R in position 4:
- Pattern: _ _ _ R _

Now place E and D:
- E can be 1, 3, 4 (but 4 is R), so 1 or 3.
- D can be 1, 2, 4 (but 4 is R), so 1 or 2.

Option 1: E in 3, D in 2:
- Pattern: _ D R E _

Need a letter for position 1. Let’s pick C:
- Word: C D R E _

This is ""C D R E _"", but we need a 5-letter word. The pattern is _ D R E _, so position 5 is still open. But we already have R, E, D used. We need another letter, but we have only 5 positions and 3 letters used (D, R, E). Wait, we need to place all 5 letters. Actually, we have R, E, D and two new letters. Let me rethink.

We need a 5-letter word containing R, E, D and two new letters. Let’s try ""BREDI"" – but I is allowed. However, this seems forced.

Let me try ""BREAD"":
- Contains B, R, E, A, D. But A is not allowed (x in arose), so invalid.

""BREED"":
- Contains B, R, E, E, D. This has two E’s, which might be possible, but we need to check positions:
  - R in position 2 – but R cannot be in 2 (from arose and trend), so invalid.

""REDIX"":
- Contains R, E, D, I, X. X is allowed (not in any x list). Let’s check positions:
  - R in 1 – but R cannot be in 1 (from redgy), so invalid.

""DERBY"":
- Contains D, E, R, B, Y. Y is not allowed (x in redgy), so invalid.

""FERDY"":
- Contains F, E, R, D, Y. Y is not allowed, invalid.

""PERID"":
- Contains P, E, R, I, D. I is allowed. Let’s check positions:
  - R in 3 (allowed, since R cannot be 1 or 2)
  - E in 2 (allowed, since E cannot be 2 or 5) – wait, E cannot be in 2 (from arose: E was in position 5 and got (-), but in trend E was in position 2 and got (-)). So E cannot be in 2, so this is invalid.

""PERID"" has E in 2 – invalid.

""MERID"":
- Contains M, E, R, I, D. E in 2 – invalid.

""BERID"":
- E in 2 – invalid.

""FERID"":
- E in 2 – invalid.

""VERID"":
- E in 2 – invalid.

""WERID"":
- E in 2 – invalid.

""PERID"" and others all have E in 2 – invalid.

Let’s try E in 1 and D in 2 with R in 3:
- Pattern: E D R _ _

Need a letter for position 4. Allowed letters: B, C, F, H, I, L, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

""EDRIV"":
- Contains E, D, R, I, V. V is allowed. Check positions:
  - E in 1 (allowed)
  - D in 2 (allowed)
  - R in 3 (allowed)
  - I in 4 (new)
  - V in 5 (new)
This is a valid 5-letter word ""EDRIV"" – but is it in the dictionary? Actually, ""EDRIV"" is not a standard English word.

""EDRUM"":
- Not a word.

""EDRIP"":
- Not a word.

""EDRIC"":
- Contains E, D, R, I, C. C is allowed. Check positions:
  - E in 1 (allowed)
  - D in 2 (allowed)
  - R in 3 (allowed)
  - I in 4 (new)
  - C in 5 (new)
This is ""EDRIC"" – a valid name but may not be accepted as a standard word.

""EDRIL"":
- Not a word.

""EDRON"":
- Contains N which is not allowed (x in trend).

""EDREM"":
- Contains M, but ""EDREM"" is not a word.

""EDRUM"" – no.

""EDRIV"" – no.

Let’s try R in 4, E in 1, D in 2:
- Pattern: E D _ R _

Need a letter for position 3. Allowed: B, C, F, H, I, L, M, P, U, V, W.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, the goal is to gather as much information as possible about the secret word. A good strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels, which can help narrow down possibilities quickly. The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it includes:
- Three common vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)
This combination maximizes the chance of hitting at least one correct letter or position, providing valuable feedback for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose” we know:
- A is NOT in the word (x).
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- O is NOT in the word (x).
- S is NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S.
- Contains R (but not in slot 2) and E (but not in slot 5).

To maximize new information, we should:
1. Include the confirmed letters R and E in new positions.
2. Avoid the letters A, O, S.
3. Introduce other common consonants and vowels.

A good next guess is “TREND”:
- T, N, D are common new letters.
- R moves from position 2 to 3.
- E moves from position 5 to 2.
This tests three new letters (T, N, D) while repositioning R and E.

Guess 2: trend -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, O, S are NOT in the word.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. trend → T(x) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(-)
   - T, N are NOT in the word.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (confirmed again).
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (confirmed again).
   - D is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, N.
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, E, D.
- Positions to avoid for R: 2.
- Positions to avoid for E: 5.
- Position to avoid for D: 5.

We need a 5-letter word that uses only the letters R, E, D plus any other letters not yet ruled out. The remaining common letters are B, C, F, G, H, I, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try a word that:
- Places R, E, D in new positions.
- Introduces two new common letters to gather more info.

A good candidate is “REDGY”:
- R in position 1 (new).
- E in position 2 (new, avoids position 5).
- D in position 3 (new, avoids position 5).
- G and Y are new letters not yet tested.

This will test:
- R in position 1.
- E in position 2.
- D in position 3.
- G and Y (two new letters).

- R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (-).
- O is NOT in the word (x).
- S is NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S.
- Contains R (but not in slot 2) and E (but not in slot 5).

To maximize new information, we should:
1. Include the confirmed letters R and E in new positions.
2. Avoid the letters A, O, S.
3. Introduce other common consonants and vowels.

A good next guess is “TREND”:
- T, N, D are common new letters.
- R moves from position 2 to 3.
- E moves from position 5 to 2.
This tests three new letters (T, N, D) while repositioning R and E.

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A, O, S are NOT in the word.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

2. trend → T(x) R(-) E(-) N(x) D(-)
   - T, N are NOT in the word.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2 (confirmed again).
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (confirmed again).
   - D is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, N.
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, E, D.
- Positions to avoid for R: 2.
- Positions to avoid for E: 5.
- Position to avoid for D: 5.

We need a 5-letter word that uses only the letters R, E, D plus any other letters not yet ruled out. The remaining common letters are B, C, F, G, H, I, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try a word that:
- Places R, E, D in new positions.
- Introduces two new common letters to gather more info.

A good candidate is “REDGY”:
- R in position 1 (new).
- E in position 2 (new, avoids position 5).
- D in position 3 (new, avoids position 5).
- G and Y are new letters not yet tested.

This will test:
- R in position 1.
- E in position 2.
- D in position 3.
- G and Y (two new letters).

From all feedback so far we know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, N, G, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word: R, E, D  
Positions ruled out:
- R cannot be in spots 2 or 1 (from arose and redgy)
- E cannot be in spot 5 (from arose) or spot 2 (from redgy)
- D cannot be in spot 5 (from trend) or spot 3 (from redgy)

So far:
- R must be in 3, 4, or 5
- E must be in 1, 3, or 4
- D must be in 1, 2, or 4

We need a 5-letter word that uses only R, E, D plus any other letters not yet ruled out (B, C, F, H, I, L, M, P, U, V, W, etc.). We want to test new positions for R, E, D and introduce one new consonant.

A good candidate is “BREED”:
- B is a new letter.
- R in position 2 (new for R).
- E in position 3 (new for E).
- E in position 4 (new for E).
- D in position 5 (but we know D can’t be in 5 from trend). So this is invalid.

Next candidate: “FREED” – same issue with D in 5.

Next: “CURED”:
- C is new.
- U is new.
- R in 1 (invalid, R can’t be in 1).
- E in 2 (invalid, E can’t be in 2).
- D in 5 (invalid).

Next: “MERID” – but M, E, R, I, D. E in 2 is invalid.

Next: “PERID” – P, E, R, I, D. E in 2 invalid.

Next: “FIDER” – F, I, D, E, R. Positions:
- F new
- I new
- D in 1 (valid)
- E in 4 (valid)
- R in 5 (valid)

This satisfies all constraints and tests new letters F and I.

From the new feedback on FIDER:

- E is in the word and in position 4 (✓)

Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, N, G, Y, F.

- Has E in position 4
- Has R in position 5
- Contains D and I somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible patterns: _ _ D I E R, _ I D _, I _ D _, etc.

Let’s try “DIDER” – but D is repeated and we don’t know if D can repeat.

Next: “IDLER” – I, D, L, E, R. L is new, but we need to check positions:
- I in 1 (valid, not ruled out)
- D in 2 (valid, not ruled out for D)
- E in 4 (✓)
- L new
- R in 5 (✓)

This fits all constraints and tests the new letter L.
