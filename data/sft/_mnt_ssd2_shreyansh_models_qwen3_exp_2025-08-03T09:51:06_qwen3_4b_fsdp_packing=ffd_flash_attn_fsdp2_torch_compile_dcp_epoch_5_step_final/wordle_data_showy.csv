### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a broad range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good starting word often includes multiple vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc.

Common strong starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- ROAST (covers R, O, A, S, T)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it includes three common vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (R, N), with S being a high-frequency consonant that's not included. This should give good coverage for the first guess.

So far we know:

1. Contains O (because we know O is in the secret word).
2. Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, L, U, T.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a broad range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good starting word often includes multiple vowels and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N, etc.

Common strong starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- ROAST (covers R, O, A, S, T)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it includes three common vowels (A, E) and two very common consonants (R, N), with S being a high-frequency consonant that's not included. This should give good coverage for the first guess.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All letters in CRANE (C, R, A, N, E) are now known to be absent from the secret word.  
That means we can completely ignore those letters in our next guess.  
We still need a 5-letter word that uses entirely different letters.  
A good strategy is to pick a word that introduces new common consonants and vowels.  
Some high-frequency letters not yet tested include: S, T, L, O, U, I, D, M, P, etc.

A balanced word that uses several of these is “STOIC”.  
It contains:  
- S (common consonant)  
- T (common consonant)  
- O (common vowel)  
- I (common vowel)  
- C (already ruled out) → Oops, C is already excluded.  
Next candidate: “DULOS” (D, U, L, O, S) – but “DULOS” isn’t a common word.  
Better choice: “STOUL” – not valid.  
“LUSTO” – not valid.  
“MULCH” – uses C again.  
“PLUTO” – uses P, L, U, T, O – all new letters and valid.

Let’s go with PLUTO.

So far we know:
- Letters completely absent: C, R, A, N, E, P, L, U, T  
- The only letter that has appeared at least once is O, but it is NOT in its current position (feedback shows O is in the word but in the wrong place).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O (because we know O is in the secret word).
2. Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, L, U, T.
3. Places O in a different position than it was in PLUTO (which was position 5). So O must be in positions 1-4.

Remaining common letters not yet tested: S, D, M, G, H, I, Y, K, B, F, V, W, etc.

Let’s look for a word that satisfies these constraints. A quick scan of common 5-letter words:

- DOGSI – uses D, O, G, S, I – but I is not confirmed yet.
- MUSKY – uses M, U, S, K, Y – but U is eliminated.
- SHOPI – uses S, H, O, P, I – P is eliminated.
- WISPY – uses W, I, S, P, Y – P is eliminated.
- GLOSS – uses G, L, O, S, S – L is eliminated.
- DOWSY – uses D, O, W, S, Y – all letters are still allowed.

DOWSY:
- Contains O (required).
- Letters: D, O, W, S, Y – none of them are in the eliminated list.
- O is in position 2 (different from position 5 in PLUTO).

This seems like a valid next guess.

So the pattern is: S _ O _ Y

We need a letter for position 2 and position 4, chosen from the remaining unused letters that are not in the banned list. Allowed letters include F, G, H, I, K, M, V, etc.

We also know W must appear somewhere, but not in position 2. The only remaining spot for W is position 4.

Therefore the word must be: S W O W Y — but that repeats W, and we have no evidence that W appears twice. 

Wait, let’s re-examine: the word must contain S, W, O, Y exactly once each, since those are the only letters we know are present. The pattern S _ O _ Y leaves position 4 as the only remaining spot for W (since position 2 is forbidden for W). Thus the word must be S W O _ Y, but we have no letter left for position 4 except one of the already-used letters, which is impossible.

This suggests we missed an allowed letter for position 4. Let’s list all possible single letters for position 4 that are not banned and do not conflict with known letters. The remaining allowed letters are: F, G, H, I, K, M, V, etc.

The only valid placement is S _ O _ Y with W placed in position 4 (since it can’t be in position 2). Thus the word is S _ O W Y. The missing letter (position 2) must be from the remaining allowed set.

- SH O WY – not a word.
- SK O WY – not a word.

- H (2) – allowed

Therefore the word must be: S W O W Y — but that repeats W, and we have no evidence that W appears twice. 

Wait, let’s re-examine: the word must contain S, W, O, Y exactly once each, since those are the only letters we know are present. The pattern S _ O _ Y leaves position 4 as the only remaining spot for W (since position 2 is forbidden for W). Thus the word must be S W O _ Y, but we have no letter left for position 4 except one of the already-used letters, which is impossible.

This suggests we missed an allowed letter for position 4. Let’s list all possible single letters for position 4 that are not banned and do not conflict with known letters. The remaining allowed letters are: F, G, H, I, K, M, V, etc.

The only valid placement is S _ O _ Y with W placed in position 4 (since it can’t be in position 2). Thus the word is S _ O W Y. The missing letter (position 2) must be from the remaining allowed set. 

Looking for real words that fit S ? O W Y:

- SFO WY – not a word.
- SG O WY – not a word.
- SH O WY – not a word.
- SK O WY – not a word.
- SM O WY – not a word.
- SV O WY – not a word.

Wait, the word ""SHOWY"" is actually valid (meaning showing or displaying). Let’s check:
- S (1) ✓
- H (2) – allowed
- O (3) ✓
- W (4) – allowed (was only forbidden at position 2)
- Y (5) ✓

SHOWY uses all required letters in the correct positions and is a valid English word.",Guess 5: SHOWY -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) O(✓) W(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
