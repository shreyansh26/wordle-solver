For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This will help me quickly determine which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Let me think through why this is a good choice:
- A: Very common vowel, appears in many words
- R: Common consonant, appears in many words
- O: Common vowel, especially in 5-letter words
- S: Extremely common consonant, appears in many words
- E: Most common letter in English

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the first position.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in the second position.
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R, but not O, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1.
- R is not in position 2.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has both A and R somewhere.
2. Does not contain O, S, or E.
3. A is not in position 1.
4. R is not in position 2.

I’ll pick a word that uses common remaining letters (T, N, L, C, etc.) and satisfies these constraints. A good candidate is “TRAIN”:
- Letters: T, R, A, I, N
- Contains A and R.
- No O, S, or E.
- A is in position 3 (not 1).
- R is in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2). Oops, that violates the second constraint.

Let me try another word. How about “CARTS”:
- Contains A and R.
- But S is excluded (feedback said S is not in the word). So this is invalid.

Next candidate: “FRANT”:
- Contains A and R.
- No O, S, E.
- A is in position 2 (not 1).
- R is in position 3 (not 2). This seems valid.

But “FRANT” is not a common word. Let me think of a more common word. “CRANE” is invalid because it has E. “TRAMP” has no A. “GRANT” has no A. “TRAIN” had R in position 2 which is invalid.

Wait, let me re-examine: R is in the word but not in position 2. So R could be in positions 3,4, or 5.

Let me try “CARTY” – but Y might be less common. “FRANC” – has C and N, but is less common.

A better common word: “DRANK”:
- Letters: D, R, A, N, K
- Contains A (position 3) and R (position 2). But R is in position 2, which is invalid.

Next: “RANCH” – has H, not sure.

Let me try “TAROC” – but O is excluded.

Another approach: list common 5-letter words without O, S, E, containing A and R, with A not in position 1 and R not in position 2.

Possible words: “RATIO” – O excluded. “RATIO” invalid.

“RATIO” invalid. “RATIO” has O.

“RADIO” – has O and E? No, E is excluded.

“RADIO” has O and I, but O is excluded.

“RAINY” – has Y, but is valid: R, A, I, N, Y. A is in position 2 (not 1), R is in position 1 (not 2). This seems valid.

“RAINY” is a common word. Let’s check:
- Contains A (position 2) and R (position 1).
- No O, S, E.
- A not in position 1 (it’s 2), R not in position 2 (it’s 1). This satisfies all constraints.

I’ll go with “RAINY”.

Current known facts:
1. Letters in the word: R, A, I  
2. Letters not in the word: O, S, E, N, Y  
3. Positions:
   - R is in position 1 (from rainy: R(✓))
   - A is in position 2 (from rainy: A(✓))
   - I is in the word but not in position 3 (from rainy: I(-))
   - Positions 4 and 5 are still unknown.

So the pattern so far: R A _ _ _  
We need two more letters that are not O, S, E, N, Y.  
Available consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Z  
Available vowels: U (since A and I are already used, and E, O are excluded)

I is still in play, so possible positions for I: 4 or 5.  
Let’s try a word that places I in position 4 and fills the last position with a common consonant.

Candidate: R A I L _ – but we need 5 letters.  
A common word: R A I D _ – “RAID_” doesn’t fit.  
Another candidate: R A I G N – but N is excluded.  
Wait, we need to pick a valid 5-letter word that fits R A _ _ _ with remaining letters.

Let me think systematically:
- First two letters: R A
- Third letter: must be from remaining letters (not O, S, E, N, Y).  
  Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z  
  But we know I is in the word (from rainy feedback), so I must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
  However, from rainy feedback, I is in the word but not in position 3, so I must be in 4 or 5.

Let’s try:
- R A _ I _  
  Need a consonant for position 3.  
  Common choices: B, C, D, G, L, M, P, T, etc.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This will help me quickly determine which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Let me think through why this is a good choice:
- A: Very common vowel, appears in many words
- R: Common consonant, appears in many words
- O: Common vowel, especially in 5-letter words
- S: Extremely common consonant, appears in many words
- E: Most common letter in English

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in the first position.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in the second position.
- O(x), S(x), E(x) → O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R, but not O, S, or E.
- A is not in position 1.
- R is not in position 2.

I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has both A and R somewhere.
2. Does not contain O, S, or E.
3. A is not in position 1.
4. R is not in position 2.

I’ll pick a word that uses common remaining letters (T, N, L, C, etc.) and satisfies these constraints. A good candidate is “TRAIN”:
- Letters: T, R, A, I, N
- Contains A and R.
- No O, S, or E.
- A is in position 3 (not 1).
- R is in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2). Oops, that violates the second constraint.

Let me try another word. How about “CARTS”:
- Contains A and R.
- But S is excluded (feedback said S is not in the word). So this is invalid.

Next candidate: “FRANT”:
- Contains A and R.
- No O, S, E.
- A is in position 2 (not 1).
- R is in position 3 (not 2). This seems valid.

But “FRANT” is not a common word. Let me think of a more common word. “CRANE” is invalid because it has E. “TRAMP” has no A. “GRANT” has no A. “TRAIN” had R in position 2 which is invalid.

Wait, let me re-examine: R is in the word but not in position 2. So R could be in positions 3,4, or 5.

Let me try “CARTY” – but Y might be less common. “FRANC” – has C and N, but is less common.

A better common word: “DRANK”:
- Letters: D, R, A, N, K
- Contains A (position 3) and R (position 2). But R is in position 2, which is invalid.

Next: “RANCH” – has H, not sure.

Let me try “TAROC” – but O is excluded.

Another approach: list common 5-letter words without O, S, E, containing A and R, with A not in position 1 and R not in position 2.

Possible words: “RATIO” – O excluded. “RATIO” invalid.

“RATIO” invalid. “RATIO” has O.

“RADIO” – has O and E? No, E is excluded.

“RADIO” has O and I, but O is excluded.

“RAINY” – has Y, but is valid: R, A, I, N, Y. A is in position 2 (not 1), R is in position 1 (not 2). This seems valid.

“RAINY” is a common word. Let’s check:
- Contains A (position 2) and R (position 1).
- No O, S, E.
- A not in position 1 (it’s 2), R not in position 2 (it’s 1). This satisfies all constraints.

I’ll go with “RAINY”.

Looking at RABID: R A B I D – fits perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess is RABID.",Guess 4: rabid -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) A(✓) B(✓) I(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
