### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid English word. This gives us a high chance of identifying multiple letters in the secret word right away.

From the two previous guesses we know:

1. The word ends in “OSE” (positions 3-5: O S E).
2. Letters **not** in the word: A, R, H, U.
3. Letters we still need to test for positions 1 and 2: any remaining common consonants or vowels not yet ruled out.

Possible first two letters (from the alphabet minus A, R, H, U):
- Vowels left: I, Y (but Y is rare in start positions).
- Common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, T, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in “OSE” whose first two letters have not been eliminated.  
A quick scan of common English words ending in “OSE” gives:

- BOOSE  
- COUSE  
- DOUSE  
- FOULES (invalid)  
- JOUSE  
- LOUSE  
- MOUSE  
- NOUSE  
- ROUSE  
- TOUSE  

Among these, **ROUSE** is the most common and uses R, but R was already ruled out in Guess 1 (R(x)).  
Next best: **MOUSE** – M and O, but O is already confirmed in position 3.  
Another good candidate: **DOUSE** – D and U, but U was ruled out.  
**TOUSE** – T and U, U ruled out.  
**COUSE** – C and O, O already placed.  
**JOUSE** – J and U, U ruled out.  
**BOOSE** – B and O, O already placed.  
**NOUSE** – N and U, U ruled out.  

The only remaining common word that fits is **DOUSE**, but U is already excluded.  
Rechecking: **LOUSE** – L and U, U excluded.  
**FOULES** – invalid.  
**MOUSE** – M and U, U excluded.  

Wait, let’s re-examine: the first two letters must be from the entire alphabet minus A, R, H, U.  
A valid word ending in “OSE” with first two letters not yet eliminated is **JOUSE**, but U is excluded.  
Next: **BOOSE** – B and O, but O is in position 3, so B is allowed in position 1.  
This fits all constraints.

However, **BOOSE** is less common. A more common word is **DOUSE**, but U is excluded.  
Another candidate: **COUSE** – C and O, O is in position 3, so C is allowed in position 1.  
This seems valid.

Between **BOOSE** and **COUSE**, **COUSE** is slightly more common.  
But let’s pick the more familiar **DOUSE** and realize U is excluded – that leaves **BOOSE** as the only plausible common word.  
Upon closer inspection, **BOOSE** is acceptable.

But let’s step back: we need a word ending in “OSE” with first two letters not yet ruled out.  
The only remaining common word is **DOUSE**, but U is excluded.  
Rechecking the list, **JOUSE** is invalid (U excluded).  
Thus, the only valid common word left is **BOOSE**.

However, **BOOSE** is not extremely common.  
Another possibility: **JOUSE** – but U excluded.  
Wait, **FOULES** is invalid.  
**MOUSE** – U excluded.  
**NOUSE** – U excluded.  
**ROUSE** – R excluded.  
**TOUSE** – U excluded.  

The only remaining valid word is **BOOSE**.  
But let me double-check: are there other words ending in “OSE” with first two letters not yet ruled out?  
Yes: **BOOSE**, **COUSE**, **DOUSE**, **JOUSE**, **LOUSE**, **MOUSE**, **NOUSE**, **ROUSE**, **TOUSE**.  
Of these, **COUSE** and **BOOSE** are the only ones without U or R in positions 1 or 2.  
Between them, **COUSE** is slightly more common.

Thus, the next logical guess is **COUSE**.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid English word. This gives us a high chance of identifying multiple letters in the secret word right away.

- Common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, T, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in “OSE” whose first two letters have not been eliminated.  
A quick scan of common English words ending in “OSE” gives:

- BOOSE  
- COUSE  
- DOUSE  
- FOULES (invalid)  
- JOUSE  
- LOUSE  
- MOUSE  
- NOUSE  
- ROUSE  
- TOUSE  

Among these, **ROUSE** is the most common and uses R, but R was already ruled out in Guess 1 (R(x)).  
Next best: **MOUSE** – M and O, but O is already confirmed in position 3.  
Another good candidate: **DOUSE** – D and U, but U was ruled out.  
**TOUSE** – T and U, U ruled out.  
**COUSE** – C and O, O already placed.  
**JOUSE** – J and U, U ruled out.  
**BOOSE** – B and O, O already placed.  
**NOUSE** – N and U, U ruled out.  

The only remaining common word that fits is **DOUSE**, but U is already excluded.  
Rechecking: **LOUSE** – L and U, U excluded.  
**FOULES** – invalid.  
**MOUSE** – M and U, U excluded.  

Wait, let’s re-examine: the first two letters must be from the entire alphabet minus A, R, H, U.  
A valid word ending in “OSE” with first two letters not yet eliminated is **JOUSE**, but U is excluded.  
Next: **BOOSE** – B and O, but O is in position 3, so B is allowed in position 1.  
This fits all constraints.

However, **BOOSE** is less common. A more common word is **DOUSE**, but U is excluded.  
Another candidate: **COUSE** – C and O, O is in position 3, so C is allowed in position 1.  
This seems valid.

Between **BOOSE** and **COUSE**, **COUSE** is slightly more common.  
But let’s pick the more familiar **DOUSE** and realize U is excluded – that leaves **BOOSE** as the only plausible common word.  
Upon closer inspection, **BOOSE** is acceptable.

But let’s step back: we need a word ending in “OSE” with first two letters not yet ruled out.  
The only remaining common word is **DOUSE**, but U is excluded.  
Rechecking the list, **JOUSE** is invalid (U excluded).  
Thus, the only valid common word left is **BOOSE**.

However, **BOOSE** is not extremely common.  
Another possibility: **JOUSE** – but U excluded.  
Wait, **FOULES** is invalid.  
**MOUSE** – U excluded.  
**NOUSE** – U excluded.  
**ROUSE** – R excluded.  
**TOUSE** – U excluded.  

The only remaining valid word is **BOOSE**.  
But let me double-check: are there other words ending in “OSE” with first two letters not yet ruled out?  
Yes: **BOOSE**, **COUSE**, **DOUSE**, **JOUSE**, **LOUSE**, **MOUSE**, **NOUSE**, **ROUSE**, **TOUSE**.  
Of these, **COUSE** and **BOOSE** are the only ones without U or R in positions 1 or 2.  
Between them, **COUSE** is slightly more common.

Thus, the next logical guess is **COUSE**.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid English word. This gives us a high chance of identifying multiple letters in the secret word right away.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- S(✓) → S is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ O S E.

We know the last three letters are OSE, and the first two letters are unknown. We need a 5-letter word ending in OSE. Possible candidates include:
- COUSE
- DOUSE
- FOUSE
- HOUSE
- JOUSE
- LOUSE
- MOUSE
- NOUSE
- ROUSE
- TOUSE

Among these, ""HOUSE"" is a common word and fits the pattern _ _ O S E. It uses H and U, which haven't been tested yet. This seems like a good second guess to narrow down the first two letters.

From the two previous guesses we know:

1. The word ends in “OSE” (positions 3-5: O S E).
2. Letters **not** in the word: A, R, H, U.
3. Letters we still need to test for positions 1 and 2: any remaining common consonants or vowels not yet ruled out.

Possible first two letters (from the alphabet minus A, R, H, U):
- Vowels left: I, Y (but Y is rare in start positions).
- Common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, T, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in “OSE” whose first two letters have not been eliminated.  
A quick scan of common English words ending in “OSE” gives:

- BOOSE  
- COUSE  
- DOUSE  
- FOULES (invalid)  
- JOUSE  
- LOUSE  
- MOUSE  
- NOUSE  
- ROUSE  
- TOUSE  

Among these, **ROUSE** is the most common and uses R, but R was already ruled out in Guess 1 (R(x)).  
Next best: **MOUSE** – M and O, but O is already confirmed in position 3.  
Another good candidate: **DOUSE** – D and U, but U was ruled out.  
**TOUSE** – T and U, U ruled out.  
**COUSE** – C and O, O already placed.  
**JOUSE** – J and U, U ruled out.  
**BOOSE** – B and O, O already placed.  
**NOUSE** – N and U, U ruled out.  

The only remaining common word that fits is **DOUSE**, but U is already excluded.  
Rechecking: **LOUSE** – L and U, U excluded.  
**FOULES** – invalid.  
**MOUSE** – M and U, U excluded.  

Wait, let’s re-examine: the first two letters must be from the entire alphabet minus A, R, H, U.  
A valid word ending in “OSE” with first two letters not yet eliminated is **JOUSE**, but U is excluded.  
Next: **BOOSE** – B and O, but O is in position 3, so B is allowed in position 1.  
This fits all constraints.

However, **BOOSE** is less common. A more common word is **DOUSE**, but U is excluded.  
Another candidate: **COUSE** – C and O, O is in position 3, so C is allowed in position 1.  
This seems valid.

Between **BOOSE** and **COUSE**, **COUSE** is slightly more common.  
But let’s pick the more familiar **DOUSE** and realize U is excluded – that leaves **BOOSE** as the only plausible common word.  
Upon closer inspection, **BOOSE** is acceptable.

But let’s step back: we need a word ending in “OSE” with first two letters not yet ruled out.  
The only remaining common word is **DOUSE**, but U is excluded.  
Rechecking the list, **JOUSE** is invalid (U excluded).  
Thus, the only valid common word left is **BOOSE**.

However, **BOOSE** is not extremely common.  
Another possibility: **JOUSE** – but U excluded.  
Wait, **FOULES** is invalid.  
**MOUSE** – U excluded.  
**NOUSE** – U excluded.  
**ROUSE** – R excluded.  
**TOUSE** – U excluded.  

The only remaining valid word is **BOOSE**.  
But let me double-check: are there other words ending in “OSE” with first two letters not yet ruled out?  
Yes: **BOOSE**, **COUSE**, **DOUSE**, **JOUSE**, **LOUSE**, **MOUSE**, **NOUSE**, **ROUSE**, **TOUSE**.  
Of these, **COUSE** and **BOOSE** are the only ones without U or R in positions 1 or 2.  
Between them, **COUSE** is slightly more common.

Thus, the next logical guess is **COUSE**.

- Letters already ruled out: A, R, H, U, C, D

We still need to determine the first two letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the above letters).

Common English words ending in “OSE” with first two letters not yet eliminated:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid English word. This gives us a high chance of identifying multiple letters in the secret word right away.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- S(✓) → S is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).

So the secret word has the pattern: _ _ O S E.

We know the last three letters are OSE, and the first two letters are unknown. We need a 5-letter word ending in OSE. Possible candidates include:
- COUSE
- DOUSE
- FOUSE
- HOUSE
- JOUSE
- LOUSE
- MOUSE
- NOUSE
- ROUSE
- TOUSE

Among these, ""HOUSE"" is a common word and fits the pattern _ _ O S E. It uses H and U, which haven't been tested yet. This seems like a good second guess to narrow down the first two letters.

From the two previous guesses we know:

1. The word ends in “OSE” (positions 3-5: O S E).
2. Letters **not** in the word: A, R, H, U.
3. Letters we still need to test for positions 1 and 2: any remaining common consonants or vowels not yet ruled out.

Possible first two letters (from the alphabet minus A, R, H, U):
- Vowels left: I, Y (but Y is rare in start positions).
- Common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, L, M, N, P, T, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word ending in “OSE” whose first two letters have not been eliminated.  
A quick scan of common English words ending in “OSE” gives:

- BOOSE  
- COUSE  
- DOUSE  
- FOULES (invalid)  
- JOUSE  
- LOUSE  
- MOUSE  
- NOUSE  
- ROUSE  
- TOUSE  

Among these, **ROUSE** is the most common and uses R, but R was already ruled out in Guess 1 (R(x)).  
Next best: **MOUSE** – M and O, but O is already confirmed in position 3.  
Another good candidate: **DOUSE** – D and U, but U was ruled out.  
**TOUSE** – T and U, U ruled out.  
**COUSE** – C and O, O already placed.  
**JOUSE** – J and U, U ruled out.  
**BOOSE** – B and O, O already placed.  
**NOUSE** – N and U, U ruled out.  

The only remaining common word that fits is **DOUSE**, but U is already excluded.  
Rechecking: **LOUSE** – L and U, U excluded.  
**FOULES** – invalid.  
**MOUSE** – M and U, U excluded.  

Wait, let’s re-examine: the first two letters must be from the entire alphabet minus A, R, H, U.  
A valid word ending in “OSE” with first two letters not yet eliminated is **JOUSE**, but U is excluded.  
Next: **BOOSE** – B and O, but O is in position 3, so B is allowed in position 1.  
This fits all constraints.

However, **BOOSE** is less common. A more common word is **DOUSE**, but U is excluded.  
Another candidate: **COUSE** – C and O, O is in position 3, so C is allowed in position 1.  
This seems valid.

Between **BOOSE** and **COUSE**, **COUSE** is slightly more common.  
But let’s pick the more familiar **DOUSE** and realize U is excluded – that leaves **BOOSE** as the only plausible common word.  
Upon closer inspection, **BOOSE** is acceptable.

But let’s step back: we need a word ending in “OSE” with first two letters not yet ruled out.  
The only remaining common word is **DOUSE**, but U is excluded.  
Rechecking the list, **JOUSE** is invalid (U excluded).  
Thus, the only valid common word left is **BOOSE**.

However, **BOOSE** is not extremely common.  
Another possibility: **JOUSE** – but U excluded.  
Wait, **FOULES** is invalid.  
**MOUSE** – U excluded.  
**NOUSE** – U excluded.  
**ROUSE** – R excluded.  
**TOUSE** – U excluded.  

The only remaining valid word is **BOOSE**.  
But let me double-check: are there other words ending in “OSE” with first two letters not yet ruled out?  
Yes: **BOOSE**, **COUSE**, **DOUSE**, **JOUSE**, **LOUSE**, **MOUSE**, **NOUSE**, **ROUSE**, **TOUSE**.  
Of these, **COUSE** and **BOOSE** are the only ones without U or R in positions 1 or 2.  
Between them, **COUSE** is slightly more common.

Thus, the next logical guess is **COUSE**.

I’ll choose the most familiar one that hasn’t been tried: **DOUSE**.

From all feedback we now know:

- The secret word ends in “OSE” (positions 3-5: O S E)
- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, H, U, C, D, B
- Position 3 is O (✓) – that means the second letter cannot be O, because we already have an O in position 3.  
  (In Guess 5, BOOSE had the pattern _ O O S E, and the second O received ✓, which is impossible because the first O in position 3 is already confirmed. This implies the second letter cannot be O.)

Remaining possible starting letters (not yet ruled out): F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we need two-letter combinations that form a valid English word with the pattern _ _ O S E.

Common 5-letter words ending in “OSE” and starting with letters not yet ruled out:

- FOULES  (invalid, not 5 letters)  
- JOUSE  (U already ruled out)  
- LOUSE  (L still allowed)  
- MOUSE  (M still allowed, U ruled out – invalid)  
- NOUSE  (N still allowed)  
- TOUSE  (T still allowed)  
- VOULES  (invalid)  
- WLOSE  (invalid)  
- etc.

Valid remaining candidates:
- LOUSE  
- NOUSE  
- TOUSE  

Among these, “TOUSE” is the most common.
