### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

After considering options, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, E) and 3 very common consonants (S, L, T)
2. These letters appear in many 5-letter words, giving good coverage for initial feedback
3. The letters are all distinct, maximizing information gained

This should give me a solid starting point to narrow down possibilities based on which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 → word starts with S
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all

So we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Contains none of L, A, T, E
3. Uses the remaining letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z)

Good consonants to test next are R, N, M, P, C, etc. and we still need to test vowels I, O, U.

A strong second guess should test new common letters while respecting the constraints. ""SHORN"" is a good choice because:
- Starts with S
- Tests H, O, R, N (none of L,A,T,E are used)
- Common letters that can help narrow down quickly
