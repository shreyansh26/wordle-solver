For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like T, N, S, R, L. A good starting word should cover these letters efficiently.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)

This gives us a broad coverage of frequently used letters, which helps narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback. If any of these letters appear in the secret word, we'll know their positions or that they're present elsewhere.

From the feedback on “arose” we know:
- A, R, S are **not** in the word at all (x).
- O and E **are** in the word, but **not** in positions 3 and 5 respectively.

So the secret word:
- Contains O and E somewhere, but not in positions 3 or 5.
- Does **not** contain A, R, or S.

To maximize information on the next guess, we should pick a word that:
1. Keeps O and E in new positions.
2. Introduces other common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, N, L, C, etc.).
3. Avoids A, R, S entirely.

A good candidate is “TONEY”:
- T, N, L are new common consonants.
- O is moved to position 2 (was 3).
- E is moved to position 4 (was 5).

This tests new letters while repositioning the known O and E.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, S, T, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word (positions still unknown): O, E, N  
Exact positions so far:
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- N is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)

So the pattern so far is: _ O _ E _  
We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Has E in position 4.
3. Contains N somewhere (but not in position 3).
4. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (so no A, R, S, T, Y).

Possible positions for N:
- Position 1 or 5 (since it can’t be 3).

We need two more consonants that haven’t been tested yet. Good candidates among unused common letters include C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word that fits _ O _ E _ and uses N in position 1:
- N O _ E _ – we need a consonant for position 3 and another for position 5.
A good choice is “NOMEN”:
- N O M E N – it has N in position 1 and 5, O in 2, E in 4, and M is a new letter.
But “NOMEN” is a valid word (though rare), so we’ll check “NOMEN” first.

Another option is “NOBLE” but B is unused and L is unused, but E is already in position 4, so that would conflict.

A better common word is “NOLAN” but A is ruled out.

Another candidate: “NOISE” – but S and I are ruled out (S is out).

Next: “NOBLE” – B is unused, but L is unused, and E is in position 4, so that’s fine, but “NOBLE” has B in position 1, O in 2, N in 3 (but N can’t be in 3), so that’s invalid.

Next: “NOGUE” – U is unused, but Y is out, so that’s okay, but “NOGUE” is obscure.

A more common word: “NOMAD” – but D is unused, and A is out.

“NOVEL” – L is unused, but E is in position 4, so that’s okay, but V is unused.

But “NOVEL” has N in position 1, O in 2, E in 4, and L in 5. That fits all constraints.

Let’s go with “NOVEL” as it’s a common word and fits all known constraints.

Check:
- N in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 2 (✓)
- O is in word, not in position 3 (ok)
- E in position 4 (✓)
- E is in word, not in position 5 (ok)
- Uses only allowed letters (no A, R, S, T, Y)

So the next guess is “NOVEL”.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
A, R, S, T, Y, V, L

Letters that ARE in the word (positions still unknown):  
O (fixed in position 2), E (fixed in position 4), N (somewhere, but NOT in positions 1, 3)

So the pattern is:  
_ O _ E _  
with N needing to go in position 5 (because positions 1 and 3 are excluded).

That gives us the skeleton:  
_ O _ E N

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2  
- Has E in position 4  
- Has N in position 5  
- Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (avoiding A, R, S, T, Y, V, L)

Available letters (common ones left): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Z

We need a letter for position 1 and position 3.

A quick scan of common English words that fit _ O _ E N:

- BOGEN – uses B and G; B is unused, G is unused → valid  
- COVEN – C and V; V is already ruled out  
- DOGEN – D and G → valid  
- FOGEN – F and G → valid  
- MOGEN – M and G → valid  

Among these, “BOGEN” is a common enough word (though rare) and uses two new letters (B and G).  
Another candidate is “DOGEN” (a surname), but “BOGEN” is slightly more common.

Let’s go with “BOGEN” as the next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like T, N, S, R, L. A good starting word should cover these letters efficiently.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)

This gives us a broad coverage of frequently used letters, which helps narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback. If any of these letters appear in the secret word, we'll know their positions or that they're present elsewhere.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose” we know:
- A, R, S are **not** in the word at all (x).
- O and E **are** in the word, but **not** in positions 3 and 5 respectively.

So the secret word:
- Contains O and E somewhere, but not in positions 3 or 5.
- Does **not** contain A, R, or S.

To maximize information on the next guess, we should pick a word that:
1. Keeps O and E in new positions.
2. Introduces other common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, N, L, C, etc.).
3. Avoids A, R, S entirely.

A good candidate is “TONEY”:
- T, N, L are new common consonants.
- O is moved to position 2 (was 3).
- E is moved to position 4 (was 5).

This tests new letters while repositioning the known O and E.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, S, T, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word (positions still unknown): O, E, N  
Exact positions so far:
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- N is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)

So the pattern so far is: _ O _ E _  
We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Has E in position 4.
3. Contains N somewhere (but not in position 3).
4. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (so no A, R, S, T, Y).

Possible positions for N:
- Position 1 or 5 (since it can’t be 3).

We need two more consonants that haven’t been tested yet. Good candidates among unused common letters include C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word that fits _ O _ E _ and uses N in position 1:
- N O _ E _ – we need a consonant for position 3 and another for position 5.
A good choice is “NOMEN”:
- N O M E N – it has N in position 1 and 5, O in 2, E in 4, and M is a new letter.
But “NOMEN” is a valid word (though rare), so we’ll check “NOMEN” first.

Another option is “NOBLE” but B is unused and L is unused, but E is already in position 4, so that would conflict.

A better common word is “NOLAN” but A is ruled out.

Another candidate: “NOISE” – but S and I are ruled out (S is out).

Next: “NOBLE” – B is unused, but L is unused, and E is in position 4, so that’s fine, but “NOBLE” has B in position 1, O in 2, N in 3 (but N can’t be in 3), so that’s invalid.

Next: “NOGUE” – U is unused, but Y is out, so that’s okay, but “NOGUE” is obscure.

A more common word: “NOMAD” – but D is unused, and A is out.

“NOVEL” – L is unused, but E is in position 4, so that’s okay, but V is unused.

But “NOVEL” has N in position 1, O in 2, E in 4, and L in 5. That fits all constraints.

Let’s go with “NOVEL” as it’s a common word and fits all known constraints.

Check:
- N in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 2 (✓)
- O is in word, not in position 3 (ok)
- E in position 4 (✓)
- E is in word, not in position 5 (ok)
- Uses only allowed letters (no A, R, S, T, Y)
- Uses new letters L and V to gather more information.

So the next guess is “NOVEL”.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like T, N, S, R, L. A good starting word should cover these letters efficiently.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- Three vowels (A, O, E)
- Two common consonants (R, S)

This gives us a broad coverage of frequently used letters, which helps narrow down possibilities quickly based on the feedback. If any of these letters appear in the secret word, we'll know their positions or that they're present elsewhere.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on “arose” we know:
- A, R, S are **not** in the word at all (x).
- O and E **are** in the word, but **not** in positions 3 and 5 respectively.

So the secret word:
- Contains O and E somewhere, but not in positions 3 or 5.
- Does **not** contain A, R, or S.

To maximize information on the next guess, we should pick a word that:
1. Keeps O and E in new positions.
2. Introduces other common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, N, L, C, etc.).
3. Avoids A, R, S entirely.

A good candidate is “TONEY”:
- T, N, L are new common consonants.
- O is moved to position 2 (was 3).
- E is moved to position 4 (was 5).

This tests new letters while repositioning the known O and E.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, S, T, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word (positions still unknown): O, E, N  
Exact positions so far:
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- N is in the word but NOT in position 3 (-)

So the pattern so far is: _ O _ E _  
We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Has E in position 4.
3. Contains N somewhere (but not in position 3).
4. Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (so no A, R, S, T, Y).

Possible positions for N:
- Position 1 or 5 (since it can’t be 3).

We need two more consonants that haven’t been tested yet. Good candidates among unused common letters include C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, etc.

Let’s try a word that fits _ O _ E _ and uses N in position 1:
- N O _ E _ – we need a consonant for position 3 and another for position 5.
A good choice is “NOMEN”:
- N O M E N – it has N in position 1 and 5, O in 2, E in 4, and M is a new letter.
But “NOMEN” is a valid word (though rare), so we’ll check “NOMEN” first.

Another option is “NOBLE” but B is unused and L is unused, but E is already in position 4, so that would conflict.

A better common word is “NOLAN” but A is ruled out.

Another candidate: “NOISE” – but S and I are ruled out (S is out).

Next: “NOBLE” – B is unused, but L is unused, and E is in position 4, so that’s fine, but “NOBLE” has B in position 1, O in 2, N in 3 (but N can’t be in 3), so that’s invalid.

Next: “NOGUE” – U is unused, but Y is out, so that’s okay, but “NOGUE” is obscure.

A more common word: “NOMAD” – but D is unused, and A is out.

“NOVEL” – L is unused, but E is in position 4, so that’s okay, but V is unused.

But “NOVEL” has N in position 1, O in 2, E in 4, and L in 5. That fits all constraints.

Let’s go with “NOVEL” as it’s a common word and fits all known constraints.

Check:
- N in position 1 (allowed)
- O in position 2 (✓)
- O is in word, not in position 3 (ok)
- E in position 4 (✓)
- E is in word, not in position 5 (ok)
- Uses only allowed letters (no A, R, S, T, Y)
- Uses new letters L and V to gather more information.

So the next guess is “NOVEL”.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
A, R, S, T, Y, V, L

Letters that ARE in the word (positions still unknown):  
O (fixed in position 2), E (fixed in position 4), N (somewhere, but NOT in positions 1, 3)

So the pattern is:  
_ O _ E _  
with N needing to go in position 5 (because positions 1 and 3 are excluded).

That gives us the skeleton:  
_ O _ E N

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2  
- Has E in position 4  
- Has N in position 5  
- Uses only letters that have not been ruled out (avoiding A, R, S, T, Y, V, L)

Available letters (common ones left): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, X, Z

We need a letter for position 1 and position 3.

A quick scan of common English words that fit _ O _ E N:

- BOGEN – uses B and G; B is unused, G is unused → valid  
- COVEN – C and V; V is already ruled out  
- DOGEN – D and G → valid  
- FOGEN – F and G → valid  
- MOGEN – M and G → valid  

Among these, “BOGEN” is a common enough word (though rare) and uses two new letters (B and G).  
Another candidate is “DOGEN” (a surname), but “BOGEN” is slightly more common.

Let’s go with “BOGEN” as the next guess.

- P O D E N  → “PODEN” – invalid  
- W O D E N  → “WODEN” – valid (Old English god Odin)  
- Z O D E N  → “ZODEN” – invalid  

The two most plausible common words are “MODEN” and “WODEN”.  
Between them, “WODEN” is a recognized English word (the old name for Odin) and uses W and D, both still allowed.

So we’ll guess “WODEN”.",Guess 6: woden -> FEEDBACK: W(✓) O(✓) D(x) E(✓) N(✓),FAIL
