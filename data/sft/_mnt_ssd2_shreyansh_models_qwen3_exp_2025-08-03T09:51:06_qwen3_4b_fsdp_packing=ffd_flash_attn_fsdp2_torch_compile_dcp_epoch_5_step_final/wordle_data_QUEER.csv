For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should have a mix of these to quickly identify which letters are in the word and which aren't.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.
- DOES contain E, but not in position 5 (since it was marked “-” in the fifth slot).

Next guess should:
1. Keep E but move it to positions 1-4.
2. Introduce new common letters that weren’t tested yet (e.g., R, N, C, H, M, P, etc.).
3. Avoid S, L, A, T entirely.

A strong candidate is “CHORE”:
- C, H, O, R are fresh letters.
- E is moved to position 4.
- No forbidden letters (S, L, A, T) are used.

This maximizes new information while respecting the constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good first guess should have a mix of these to quickly identify which letters are in the word and which aren't.

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- L(x) – L is not in the word.
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.
- DOES contain E, but not in position 5 (since it was marked “-” in the fifth slot).

Next guess should:
1. Keep E but move it to positions 1-4.
2. Introduce new common letters that weren’t tested yet (e.g., R, N, C, H, M, P, etc.).
3. Avoid S, L, A, T entirely.

A strong candidate is “CHORE”:
- C, H, O, R are fresh letters.
- E is moved to position 4.
- No forbidden letters (S, L, A, T) are used.

This maximizes new information while respecting the constraints.

So far we know:

Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, H, O  
Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): E, R

E was in the wrong place in both guesses (positions 5 and 4 respectively), so E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3.

R was in the wrong place in guess 2 (position 4), so R must appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains both E and R
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, C, H, O
- Places E in position 1, 2, or 3
- Places R in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not the same spot as E)

Fresh letters we haven’t tried yet: D, F, G, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y

Let’s pick a word that satisfies these rules. One good candidate is “FIRED”:
- F, I, D are new letters.
- E is in position 3 (allowed).
- R is in position 2 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters are used.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, C, H, O
- Places E in position 1, 2, or 3
- Places R in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not the same spot as E)

Fresh letters we haven’t tried yet: D, F, G, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y

Let’s pick a word that satisfies these rules. One good candidate is “FIRED”:
- F, I, D are new letters.
- E is in position 3 (allowed).
- R is in position 2 (allowed).
- No forbidden letters are used.

This should give us more information about the positions of E and R and possibly reveal new letters.

Let’s summarize everything we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, H, O, F, I, D  
   (eliminated by the “x” feedback).

2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - E (now confirmed in position 4, because in FIRED it was marked ✓ in slot 4).
   - R (must appear somewhere, but not in position 2 or 4).

3. Remaining possible positions for R:
   - Positions 1, 3, or 5 (since 2 and 4 are taken by E and R cannot repeat in the same spot).

4. Still-untested common letters: N, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, B, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 4.
- Has R in position 1, 3, or 5.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

A quick scan of common words with E in slot 4 and R somewhere else gives:

- **BROKE** – but O is already out.
- **NURSE** – S is out.
- **PERKY** – P, E, R, K, Y: none of these have been eliminated yet, and R is in position 3, E in 4. This looks valid.

Let’s check:
- P: new
- E: ✓ in position 4
- R: new position 3 (allowed)
- K: new
- Y: new

No forbidden letters used. This should give us info on R’s placement and possibly reveal K and Y.

Let’s re-summarize everything we now know after the four guesses.

1. Letters that are NOT in the word (eliminated by “x”):
   S, L, A, T, C, H, O, F, I, D, P, K, Y.

2. Letters that ARE in the word (from the “-” and “✓” feedback):
   - E is in the word, but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (because it got “-” in positions 2, 4 and “-” again in position 2 of PERKY).  
     Therefore E must be in position 1.

   - R is in the word, but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (because it got “-” in positions 2 and 3).  
     Therefore R must be in position 5.

3. So far we have:
   _ _ _ _ _
   E _ _ _ R   (positions 1 and 5 locked)

4. Remaining allowed letters (not yet eliminated):
   B, G, J, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

5. We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with E and ends with R, using only the allowed letters in between.

   Common English words that fit E _ _ _ R:
   - EAGER – but A is eliminated.
   - EMBER – but M, B are allowed, and we haven’t tried them yet.
   - ENVR? – no such word.
   - EUGEN? – too obscure.
   - EMBER is the only common word left that fits.

Check EMBER:
- E: position 1 (allowed)
- M: new
- B: new
- E: already known to be in word
- R: position 5 (allowed)

No eliminated letters are used. This should confirm the remaining letters and their positions.

Let’s process the new feedback from EMBER.

1. EMBER feedback:  
   E(-)  M(x)  B(x)  E(✓)  R(✓)

2. Interpreting the symbols:  
   - E in position 1: “-” → E is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   - M in position 2: “x” → M is NOT in the word.  
   - B in position 3: “x” → B is NOT in the word.  
   - E in position 4: “✓” → E is in the word AND in position 4.  
   - R in position 5: “✓” → R is in the word AND in position 5.

3. Current constraints:  
   - Word must be 5 letters.  
   - R is fixed in position 5.  
   - E is fixed in position 4.  
   - No M, B, or any previously eliminated letters.  
   - E is NOT in position 1.  
   - From earlier: S, L, A, T, C, H, O, F, I, D, P, K, Y, M, B are all out.  
   - Remaining possible letters (besides E and R): G, J, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

4. The word pattern is:  
   _ _ _ E R

5. We need a valid 5-letter word ending in “_ER” with E in the fourth position and using only the allowed letters.  
   Possible candidates:  
   - G U E R → GUE R? Not a word.  
   - N U E R → N U E R? Not a word.  
   - V I E R? I is out.  
   - G E N E R → G E N E R? That’s “GENER” (short for generate), but N is allowed.  
   - W I E R? I is out.  
   - U N E R → “UNER”? Not a word.  
   - V E N E R → “VENER”? Not common.  
   - N E X E R → “NEXER”? Not a word.  
   - G E N E R → “GENER” is actually valid (as a variant spelling of “generate” or “generous”).  
   - U N E R → Not valid.  
   - V E R E → Too short.  
   - J E N E R → “JEN E R”? Not a word.  

6. The only remaining valid word that fits the pattern _ _ _ E R with allowed letters is “GENER”.  
   Check letters: G, E, N, E, R.  
   - G, N are allowed.  
   - E is allowed in positions 2,3,4 (already fixed in 4).  
   - R is fixed in 5.
