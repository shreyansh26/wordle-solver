### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to make a strategic choice that maximizes the information gained. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible
3. Include vowels to help identify vowel positions

Common starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. I'll choose a word that uses these common letters without repeating any. ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of common letters and vowels to start narrowing down possibilities.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the three guesses.

1. Position 5 is definitely E (from SLATE).
2. The letters S, L, A, T, C, H, R, M, N, Y are NOT in the word at all.
3. From MONEY we also learned:
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (it was marked “-” there).
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (it was marked “-” there).
4. Therefore:
   - Position 3 cannot be O (from CHORE feedback) and cannot be E (from MONEY feedback).
   - Position 4 cannot be E (from MONEY feedback).
   - The remaining common letters we have not tried yet: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains O somewhere (but not in position 2 or 3) and uses only letters from the remaining pool.

Possible patterns:
- O could be in position 1 or 4.
- Position 4 cannot be E, so if O is in position 4, that’s fine.
- Position 1 could be O.

Let’s try “FOGIE”:
- F, G, I are new letters.

- Ends with E.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess, I have no prior information about the secret word. My goal is to make a strategic choice that maximizes the information gained. A good first guess should:
1. Use common letters that appear frequently in English words
2. Avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible
3. Include vowels to help identify vowel positions

Common starting words often include letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. I'll choose a word that uses these common letters without repeating any. ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of common letters and vowels to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- L(x) → L is not in the word.
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- T(x) → T is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in the 5th (last) position.

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. The letters S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.
3. We have four unknown letters in positions 1-4.

Next guess should:
- Keep E in position 5.
- Avoid S, L, A, T.
- Introduce new common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: R, N, I, C, H, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

A strong choice is ""CHORE"":
- C, H, O, R are new common letters.
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Doesn’t reuse any eliminated letters (S, L, A, T).

So we have:
- Position 5: E
- Position 3: not O (and not S, L, A, T, C, H, R)
- We still need to test other common letters that haven’t been used yet: N, D, M, P, B, G, K, F, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Keep E in position 5.
- Avoid all eliminated letters (S, L, A, T, C, H, R).
- Introduce new common letters in positions 1, 2, 3, 4.

Let’s try “MONEY”:
- M, N, Y are new letters.
- O is in the word but not in position 3, so it could fit in position 1 or 2.

1. Position 5 is definitely E (from every guess).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, C, H, R, M, N, Y, F, G.
3. From MONEY and FOGIE we learned:
   - O is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (it was marked “-” in positions 2 and 4, and was already not in position 3 from CHORE).
   - Therefore, the only remaining place for O is position 1.
   - E is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (from MONEY and SLATE). However, we already know E is in position 5, so this is consistent—E is only in position 5.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from FOGIE).
4. Remaining unused common letters (avoiding the eliminated set): B, D, K, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

- Has O in position 1.
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool.

Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- L(x) → L is not in the word.
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- T(x) → T is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in the 5th (last) position.

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. The letters S, L, A, T are not in the word at all.
3. We have four unknown letters in positions 1-4.

Next guess should:
- Keep E in position 5.
- Avoid S, L, A, T.
- Introduce new common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: R, N, I, C, H, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

A strong choice is ""CHORE"":
- C, H, O, R are new common letters.
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Doesn’t reuse any eliminated letters (S, L, A, T).

Let’s try CHORE.

Guess 2: CHORE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) O(✓) R(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two previous guesses we now know:

1. The word ends with E (position 5 is E).
2. The letters S, L, A, T, C, H, R are not in the word at all.
3. The letter O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (because O was marked ✓ in CHORE, meaning it is in the word but not in position 3).

So we have:
- Position 5: E
- Position 3: not O (and not S, L, A, T, C, H, R)
- We still need to test other common letters that haven’t been used yet: N, D, M, P, B, G, K, F, V, W, Y, etc.

A good next guess should:
- Keep E in position 5.
- Avoid all eliminated letters (S, L, A, T, C, H, R).
- Introduce new common letters in positions 1, 2, 3, 4.

Let’s try “MONEY”:
- M, N, Y are new letters.
- O is in the word but not in position 3, so it could fit in position 1 or 2.
- Ends with E (position 5).

This tests M, N, Y, and keeps O in play while avoiding all eliminated letters.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the three guesses.

1. Position 5 is definitely E (from SLATE).
2. The letters S, L, A, T, C, H, R, M, N, Y are NOT in the word at all.
3. From MONEY we also learned:
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 2 (it was marked “-” there).
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 4 (it was marked “-” there).
4. Therefore:
   - Position 3 cannot be O (from CHORE feedback) and cannot be E (from MONEY feedback).
   - Position 4 cannot be E (from MONEY feedback).
   - The remaining common letters we have not tried yet: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains O somewhere (but not in position 2 or 3) and uses only letters from the remaining pool.

Possible patterns:
- O could be in position 1 or 4.
- Position 4 cannot be E, so if O is in position 4, that’s fine.
- Position 1 could be O.

Let’s try “FOGIE”:
- F, G, I are new letters.
- O is in position 1 (which is allowed).
- Ends with E.
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Let’s summarize what we now know after four guesses.

1. Position 5 is definitely E (from every guess).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word at all: S, L, A, T, C, H, R, M, N, Y, F, G.
3. From MONEY and FOGIE we learned:
   - O is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 4 (it was marked “-” in positions 2 and 4, and was already not in position 3 from CHORE).
   - Therefore, the only remaining place for O is position 1.
   - E is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (from MONEY and SLATE). However, we already know E is in position 5, so this is consistent—E is only in position 5.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (from FOGIE).
4. Remaining unused common letters (avoiding the eliminated set): B, D, K, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Has O in position 1.
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool.
- Has I somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 is E), so positions 2 or 3.
- Does not use any eliminated letters.

Possible patterns: O _ I _ E or O _ _ I E.

Let’s try “OPIUM”:
- O in position 1 (required).
- P and U are new letters.
- I in position 3.
- Ends with E (position 5).

But wait, “OPIME” is not a valid word. “OPIUM” is 5 letters but ends with M, not E. Let’s try “OVINE”:
- O in position 1.
- V, I, N, E.
- N is eliminated, so no.

Next try “ODIUM”:
- Not a valid word.

Try “OBILE”:
- O in position 1.
- B, I, L, E.
- L is eliminated.

Try “OPINE”:
- O in position 1.
- P, I, N, E.
- N is eliminated.

Try “OVINE” again—N is eliminated.

Try “OPINE” is invalid because N is eliminated.

Next possible word: “OPIE” is 4 letters.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words with O in position 1 and E in position 5, avoiding eliminated letters.

Possible words:
- OPIUM (invalid, ends with M)
- OVINE (invalid, N)
- OPINE (invalid, N)
- OXIDE (X is allowed, I is allowed, D is allowed)
- OPIUM is invalid, but “OXIDE” is valid:
   - O in 1, X in 2, I in 3, D in 4, E in 5.
   - X, I, D are not eliminated.
   - I is in position 3, which is allowed (not position 4).

“OXIDE” fits all constraints.

From the five guesses we now know:

1. Position 5 is definitely E (from every guess).
2. Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, H, R, M, N, Y, F, G, X.
3. From MONEY and FOGIE and OXIDE:
   - O is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (it was marked “-” in positions 1, 2, 3, 4).  
     Therefore O must be in position 5, but position 5 is already E.  
     This is a contradiction unless we mis-read the feedback.

Wait, let’s re-check the feedback carefully:

- Guess 1: SLATE → E(✓) at position 5.
- Guess 2: CHORE → O(✓) at position 3, E(✓) at position 5.
- Guess 3: MONEY → O(-) at position 2, E(-) at position 4.
- Guess 4: FOGIE → O(-) at position 2, I(-) at position 4, E(✓) at position 5.
- Guess 5: OXIDE → O(-) at position 1, I(-) at position 3, D(✓) at position 4, E(✓) at position 5.

So the constraints are:

- Position 5 = E.
- O is in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (because it was marked “-” in all these positions).  
  This is impossible because position 5 is already E.  
  Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that the feedback must have been mis-recorded, or we are misinterpreting it.

But assuming the feedback is correct, the only way for O to be in the word but not in positions 1-4 and 5 is if the word has two O’s, one in position 5 and one elsewhere. However, position 5 is E, so this is impossible.

This suggests an inconsistency in the feedback, but since we must proceed, the only logical resolution is that the word must contain O in position 5, but position 5 is E. This is impossible, so the only remaining possibility is that the word is “OXIDE” and the feedback for OXIDE is mis-recorded.

However, since we must continue, let’s re-examine the constraints carefully:

- Position 5 = E (from all guesses).
- O is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3 (from OXIDE, MONEY, FOGIE, CHORE).
- Therefore, O must be in position 4.  
  But from MONEY, E was marked “-” at position 4, which would imply E is not in position 4, which is consistent because E is in position 5.  
  So the word must be O _ _ _ E with O in position 4.

Thus, the pattern is: O _ _ O E.

Looking for 5-letter words ending in OE, with O in position 4:  
Possible word: “BOOGE” (invalid), “DOOGE” (invalid), “FOOGE” (invalid), “KOOL” (4 letters), “POOKE” (invalid), “TOOKE” (invalid).

Actually, the only valid 5-letter word with this pattern is “BOOGE” (not valid), “DOOGE” (not valid), “KOOL” (4 letters). This suggests no valid word fits, indicating an error in our interpretation.

Rechecking the feedback for OXIDE:  
OXIDE → O(-) X(x) I(-) D(✓) E(✓)  
- O(-) means O is in the word but not in position 1.  
- I(-) means I is in the word but not in position 3.  
- D(✓) means D is in position 4.  
- E(✓) means E is in position 5.

Thus, the constraints are:
- Position 5 = E.
- Position 4 = D.
- O is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 (from previous feedback).  
  Wait, no:  
  - From MONEY: O(-) at position 2 (so O not in 2).  
  - From CHORE: O(✓) at position 3 (so O is in 3).  
  - From FOGIE: O(-) at position 2 (consistent).  
  - From OXIDE: O(-) at position 1 (consistent).

So the word must have O in position 3, D in position 4, E in position 5.  
Thus, the pattern is: _ _ O D E.

We need a 5-letter word ending in ODE with letters not in the eliminated set.  
Valid words: “BOODE” (invalid), “COODE” (invalid), “DOODE” (invalid), “FOODE” (invalid), “HOODE” (invalid), “JOODE” (invalid), “KOODE” (invalid), “LOODE” (invalid), “MOODE” (invalid), “NOODE” (invalid), “POODE” (invalid), “ROODE” (invalid), “SOODE” (invalid), “TOODE” (invalid), “VOODE” (invalid), “WOODE” (valid), “ZOODE” (invalid).

The only valid word fitting _ _ O D E is “WOODE”.

Check letters: W, O, O, D, E.  
- W, O, D, E are not in the eliminated set.  
- O is in position 3 (consistent with CHORE feedback).  
- D is in position 4 (consistent with OXIDE feedback).  
- E is in position 5 (consistent).

Therefore, the correct word is “WOODE”.

3. From MONEY and FOGIE and OXIDE:
   - O is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (it was marked “-” in positions 1, 2, 3, 4).

Thus, the constraints are:
