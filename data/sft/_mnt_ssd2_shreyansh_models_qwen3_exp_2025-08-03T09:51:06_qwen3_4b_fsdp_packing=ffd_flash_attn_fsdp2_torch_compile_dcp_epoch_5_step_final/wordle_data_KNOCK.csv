### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""SLATE"" is a popular starting choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance to identify several letters in the secret word right away. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D  
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: O and N

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both O and N (since they are confirmed in the word).
2. Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters (S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D).
3. Places O and N in positions different from their previous (wrong) positions:
   - In ROUND, O was in position 2 and N in position 4, so we need to move them elsewhere.
4. Uses only remaining common letters (from the alphabet minus the eliminated set).

Remaining common letters (excluding the eliminated ones): B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the required O and N.

Let’s brainstorm words with O and N, avoiding the eliminated letters:
- “COBAN” – but A is eliminated.
- “HONKY” – K and Y are okay, but we need to check positions.
- “FONIC” – I is okay, but C is okay.
- “PONCHO” – too long.
- “BONGO” – G is okay, but O is in position 5 (allowed), N in position 2 (allowed).
- “CONIC” – C is okay, I is okay, but N is in position 1 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed).
- “MONKS” – S is eliminated.
- “GONIF” – G, I, F are okay, O in position 2 (allowed), N in position 1 (allowed).
- “CONEY” – E is eliminated.
- “BONNY” – Y is okay, but N is repeated, which might be possible.
- “PONI” – too short.
- “HONKY” – H, O, N, K, Y – all letters are allowed, positions: O in 2 (was wrong), N in 3 (was wrong in ROUND at 4, so this is fine), K and Y are new.

“HONKY” seems valid: it contains O and N, avoids all eliminated letters, and moves O and N to new positions.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""SLATE"" is a popular starting choice because it contains:\n- S (very common starting letter)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (common vowel)\n- T (common consonant)\n- E (most common vowel)\n\nThis combination gives me a good chance to identify several letters in the secret word right away. I\'ll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  \nThat means the secret word contains none of those letters.  \nI now need a word that avoids S, L, A, T, E entirely and still uses common letters.  \nGood remaining consonants include R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, etc.  \nGood remaining vowels include I, O, U.  \nA strong second guess should mix common consonants and vowels to maximize information gain.  \n""ROUND"" is a good candidate: it uses R, O, U, N, D — none of which were in SLATE, and it covers several high-frequency letters (R, O, U, N).\n\n<guess>ROUND</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'So far we know:\n- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D  \n- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: O and N\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that:\n1.

So far we know:

Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D, H, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: O, N, K

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O, N, K (all confirmed in the word, but in wrong positions so far).
2. Does NOT contain any of the eliminated letters.
3. Places O, N, K in positions different from their previous (wrong) positions:
   - In ROUND: O was position 2, N was position 4.
   - In HONKY: O was position 2, N was position 3, K was position 4.
   So O cannot be 2, N cannot be 3 or 4, and K cannot be 4.

Remaining common letters (excluding the eliminated set): B, C, F, G, I, J, M, P, V, W, X, Z (plus the required O, N, K).

We need to place O, N, K plus two more letters from the remaining pool, ensuring no letter is in its previously disallowed position.

Let’s try to build a valid word:

- O must go in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2).
- N must go in 1, 2, 4, or 5 (cannot be 3 or 4) → positions 1, 2, or 5.
- K must go in 1, 2, 3, or 5 (cannot be 4).

Let’s list possible positions for O, N, K:

Option: O in 1, N in 2, K in 3 → word starts with O N K _ _  
We need two more letters from B, C, F, G, I, J, M, P, V, W, X, Z.  
Possible: O N K _ _ → O N K I F → ""ONKIF"" – but this is not a valid English word.

Option: O in 1, N in 5, K in 3 → O _ K _ N  
Possible letters: O B K I N → ""OBKIN"" – not valid.

Option: O in 3, N in 1, K in 2 → N K O _ _  
Possible: N K O _ _ → N K O M P → ""Nkom"" – not valid.

Option: O in 3, N in 5, K in 2 → _ K O _ N  
Possible: B K O M N → ""Bkomn"" – not valid.

Option: O in 4, N in 1, K in 2 → N K _ O _  
Possible: N K I O _ → N K I O P → ""NKIOP"" – not valid.

Option: O in 4, N in 2, K in 1 → K N _ O _  
Possible: K N I O P → ""KN IOP"" – not valid.

Option: O in 5, N in 1, K in 2 → N K _ _ O  
Possible: N K I M O → ""NKIMO"" – not valid.

Option: O in 5, N in 2, K in 1 → K N _ _ O  
Possible: K N I M O → ""KNIMO"" – not valid.

Let’s try a different approach: use common remaining consonants and see if we can form a valid word with O, N, K in new positions.

Remaining letters: B, C, F, G, I, J, M, P, V, W, X, Z

We need two more letters plus O, N, K.

Let’s try ""CONIC"" – but C is okay, I is okay, but N is in position 1 (allowed), O in position 2 (disallowed), so invalid.

""KNOCK"" – K is in position 1 (allowed), N in 2 (allowed), O in 3 (allowed), C in 4 (allowed), K in 5 (allowed).  
Check letters: K, N, O, C, K – all are from allowed set, and positions are new for O, N, K.

This seems valid: K N O C K.

But let’s verify:
- K: position 1 (was position 4 in HONKY – new)
- N: position 2 (was position 3 in HONKY – new)
- O: position 3 (was position 2 in ROUND – new)
- C: new letter
- K: position 5 (new)

This appears to satisfy all constraints.
