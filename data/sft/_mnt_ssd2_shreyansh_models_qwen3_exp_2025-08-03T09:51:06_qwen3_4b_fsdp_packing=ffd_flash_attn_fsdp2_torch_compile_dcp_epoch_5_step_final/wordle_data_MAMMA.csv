### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices.

A strategic first guess would be ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test positions and frequencies.

From the feedback on SLATE:

- A: - → in word but wrong position

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, C, R, N
- Letter A is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 2 (from SLATE and CRANE feedback)
- Therefore A must be in position 1, 4, or 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A (and only in positions 1, 4, or 5)
2. Does NOT contain S, L, T, E, C, R, N
3. Uses other common letters we haven't tested yet

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's try to place A in position 1 and test new common letters:
- A _ _ _ _
Possible candidates: ABOMI, AFOUL, AFOOT (but T is out), AFOGS (S is out), etc. None of these are valid 5-letter words.

Next, try A in position 4:
- _ _ _ A _
Possible candidates: BUMPY, DUMPY, HUMPY, GUMPY, etc. These are valid but not common.

Try A in position 5:
- _ _ _ _ A
Common words ending in A: MOUTH, but T is out; DOWNS, but S is out; etc.

Looking at remaining letters, let's try ""MOUTH"":

Next, try ""FOULS"" - but S is out.

- CRANE: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
This means A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (it was in position 3 in CRANE). So A can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)

3. GAUDY → G(x) A(✓) U(x) D(x) Y(x)

So the word looks like: _ A _ _ _

Remaining common letters we haven’t tested: B, F, H, I, K, M, O, P, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with A in position 2 and only letters from the allowed set.

Possible patterns: B A _ _ _, F A _ _ _, H A _ _ _, etc.

Let’s try to find a valid word:

- B A _ _ _ → BAHUM? (invalid)  
- F A _ _ _ → F A C E S? (but E, S are out)  
- H A _ _ _ → H A R D Y? (R, D, Y are out)  
- M A _ _ _ → M A C H Y? (C, Y are out)  
- P A _ _ _ → P A P A S? (S is out)  
- V A _ _ _ → V A I N S? (S is out)  
- W A _ _ _ → W A I N S? (S is out)  
- B A _ _ _ → B A I L S? (S is out)  
- B A _ _ _ → B A I L? (only 4 letters)  

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words with A in position 2 and no banned letters:

- B A _ _ _ → BAHUB? (invalid)  
- F A _ _ _ → FAINT? (I, N, T – T is out)  
- H A _ _ _ → HABIT? (I, T – T is out)  
- M A _ _ _ → MAJOR? (O, R – R is out)  
- P A _ _ _ → PAPAW? (P, W are allowed)  
- P A _ _ _ → PAPAL? (invalid)  
- V A _ _ _ → VAPOR? (O, R – R is out)  
- W A _ _ _ → WAKER? (K, E, R – E, R are out)  
- B A _ _ _ → BALMY? (M, Y – Y is out)  
- B A _ _ _ → BAZOO? (Z, O – O is allowed)  

Let’s pick a valid word: PAPAW (but W is allowed, A is in position 2, P is allowed, A, W is allowed). However, PAPAW uses P twice, which is okay.

But let’s check if PAPAW is valid: yes, it’s a 5-letter word.

However, let me think of another word that uses more unique letters: BAHUB? Not valid. How about BAZOO? That’s a valid word (though rare).

But let’s try to find a more common word: BAHUM? No.

Another approach: look for words with A in position 2 and remaining letters from the allowed set.

Looking at remaining letters: B, F, H, I, K, M, O, P, V, W.

Possible combinations:

- B A I L S? S is out.  
- B A I L? 4 letters.  
- B A M B O? 5 letters, but O is allowed. BAMB? No.  
- B A M B O? BAMB? No.  
- F A C E S? E, S are out.  
- F A I R Y? R, Y are out.  
- H A I R Y? R, Y are out.  
- M A C H O? C is out.  
- P A P A S? S is out.  
- V A I N S? S is out.  
- W A I N S? S is out.  

Wait, let’s list valid words systematically:

With A in position 2:

- B A _ _ _ → BAHUB? No. BAZOO? Yes.  
- F A _ _ _ → FAINT? T is out.  
- H A _ _ _ → HABIT? T is out.  
- M A _ _ _ → MAJOR? R is out.  
- P A _ _ _ → PAPAW? Yes.  
- V A _ _ _ → VAPOR? R is out.  
- W A _ _ _ → WAKER? K, E, R – E, R out.  

So the only valid words seem to be BAZOO and PAPAW. Between these, BAZOO uses Z and O, which are allowed. PAPAW is also valid.

Let’s choose BAZOO as it introduces Z and O.

But wait, let me double-check: BAZOO is a valid word (a type of animal). However, let’s see if there are better options.

Another word: BAHUM? No. BAHUB? No.

Let me think differently: the remaining letters include B, F, H, I, K, M, O, P, V, W.

Possible words:

- B A I L S? S is out.  
- B A I L? 4 letters.  
- B A M B O? Not a word.  
- B A M B O? No.  
- F A I R Y? R, Y out.  
- H A I R Y? R, Y out.  
- M A C H O? C out.  
- P A P A S? S out.  
- V A I N S? S out.  
- W A I N S? S out.  

It appears BAZOO is the only valid word left that fits. However, let’s verify BAZOO:

Letters: B, A, Z, O, O. None are in the banned list (S, L, T, E, C, R, N, G, U, D, Y). A is in position 2 (✓). This seems correct.

But let me think of another word: BAHUB? Not valid. BAHUM? Not valid.

Another candidate: PAPAW. Letters: P, A, P, A, W. None are banned. A is in position 2. This is valid.

Between BAZOO and PAPAW, PAPAW is more common. Let’s go with PAPAW.

Wait, but PAPAW has A in position 2 and uses P twice, which is allowed.

However, let’s check if there are other words:

- B A M B O? No.  
- B A I L? 4 letters.  
- B A M? 3 letters.  

It seems PAPAW is the best choice.

But let me re-examine: the remaining letters are B, F, H, I, K, M, O, P, V, W.

Another word: B A M B O? No.  
F A I R Y? R, Y out.  
H A I R Y? R, Y out.  
M A C H O? C out.  
V A I N S? S out.  
W A I N S? S out.  

So PAPAW is the only valid 5-letter word left that fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is PAPAW.

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, G, U, D, Y

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices.

A strategic first guess would be ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test positions and frequencies.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in word
- L: x → not in word
- A: - → in word but wrong position
- T: x → not in word
- E: x → not in word

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E
- DOES contain A, but not in the 3rd position (so A must be in 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th)
- Remaining common letters to test: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc.

Next guess should:
1. Include A in a different position (2nd, 4th, or 5th)
2. Introduce new common letters not yet tested
3. Avoid S, L, T, E

A good candidate is ""CRANE"":
- C, R, N are new common letters
- A is moved to 2nd position (was 3rd in SLATE)
- E is avoided (already ruled out)
- No S, L, T

Guess 2: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, C, R, N
- Letter A is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 2 (from SLATE and CRANE feedback)
- Therefore A must be in position 1, 4, or 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A (and only in positions 1, 4, or 5)
2. Does NOT contain S, L, T, E, C, R, N
3. Uses other common letters we haven't tested yet

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's try to place A in position 1 and test new common letters:
- A _ _ _ _
Possible candidates: ABOMI, AFOUL, AFOOT (but T is out), AFOGS (S is out), etc. None of these are valid 5-letter words.

Next, try A in position 4:
- _ _ _ A _
Possible candidates: BUMPY, DUMPY, HUMPY, GUMPY, etc. These are valid but not common.

Try A in position 5:
- _ _ _ _ A
Common words ending in A: MOUTH, but T is out; DOWNS, but S is out; etc.

Looking at remaining letters, let's try ""MOUTH"":
- M, O, U, T, H
But T is already ruled out.

Next, try ""FOULS"" - but S is out.

Try ""GAUDY"":
- G, A, U, D, Y
This uses new letters (G, U, D, Y) and places A in position 2 (but A was marked as wrong position in CRANE where it was in position 3, but in CRANE it was position 2, so actually A can be in position 2? Wait, let's re-examine:

From CRANE feedback:
- CRANE: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
This means A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (it was in position 3 in CRANE). So A can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

So ""GAUDY"" has A in position 2 - this is allowed.

But let's verify:
GAUDY letters: G, A, U, D, Y - none of S, L, T, E, C, R, N are present, and A is in position 2 (allowed).

This seems like a good next guess to test G, U, D, Y and confirm A's position.

- B A _ _ _ → B A I L? (only 4 letters)  

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words with A in position 2 and no banned letters:

- B A _ _ _ → BAHUB? (invalid)  
- F A _ _ _ → FAINT? (I, N, T – T is out)  
- H A _ _ _ → HABIT? (I, T – T is out)  
- M A _ _ _ → MAJOR? (O, R – R is out)  
- P A _ _ _ → PAPAW? (P, W are allowed)  
- P A _ _ _ → PAPAL? (invalid)  
- V A _ _ _ → VAPOR? (O, R – R is out)  
- W A _ _ _ → WAKER? (K, E, R – E, R are out)  
- B A _ _ _ → BALMY? (M, Y – Y is out)  
- B A _ _ _ → BAZOO? (Z, O – O is allowed)  

Let’s pick a valid word: PAPAW (but W is allowed, A is in position 2, P is allowed, A, W is allowed). However, PAPAW uses P twice, which is okay.

But let’s check if PAPAW is valid: yes, it’s a 5-letter word.

However, let me think of another word that uses more unique letters: BAHUB? Not valid. How about BAZOO? That’s a valid word (though rare).

But let’s try to find a more common word: BAHUM? No.

Another approach: look for words with A in position 2 and remaining letters from the allowed set.

Looking at remaining letters: B, F, H, I, K, M, O, P, V, W.

Possible combinations:

- B A I L S? S is out.  
- B A I L? 4 letters.  
- B A M B O? 5 letters, but O is allowed. BAMB? No.  
- B A M B O? BAMB? No.  
- F A C E S? E, S are out.  
- F A I R Y? R, Y are out.  
- H A I R Y? R, Y are out.  
- M A C H O? C is out.  
- P A P A S? S is out.  
- V A I N S? S is out.  
- W A I N S? S is out.  

Wait, let’s list valid words systematically:

With A in position 2:

- B A _ _ _ → BAHUB? No. BAZOO? Yes.  
- F A _ _ _ → FAINT? T is out.  
- H A _ _ _ → HABIT? T is out.  
- M A _ _ _ → MAJOR? R is out.  
- P A _ _ _ → PAPAW? Yes.  
- V A _ _ _ → VAPOR? R is out.  
- W A _ _ _ → WAKER? K, E, R – E, R out.  

So the only valid words seem to be BAZOO and PAPAW. Between these, BAZOO uses Z and O, which are allowed. PAPAW is also valid.

Let’s choose BAZOO as it introduces Z and O.

But wait, let me double-check: BAZOO is a valid word (a type of animal). However, let’s see if there are better options.

Another word: BAHUM? No. BAHUB? No.

Let me think differently: the remaining letters include B, F, H, I, K, M, O, P, V, W.

Possible words:

- B A I L S? S is out.  
- B A I L? 4 letters.  
- B A M B O? Not a word.  
- B A M B O? No.  
- F A I R Y? R, Y out.  
- H A I R Y? R, Y out.  
- M A C H O? C out.  
- P A P A S? S out.  
- V A I N S? S out.  
- W A I N S? S out.  

It appears BAZOO is the only valid word left that fits. However, let’s verify BAZOO:

Letters: B, A, Z, O, O. None are in the banned list (S, L, T, E, C, R, N, G, U, D, Y). A is in position 2 (✓). This seems correct.

But let me think of another word: BAHUB? Not valid. BAHUM? Not valid.

Another candidate: PAPAW. Letters: P, A, P, A, W. None are banned. A is in position 2. This is valid.

Between BAZOO and PAPAW, PAPAW is more common. Let’s go with PAPAW.

Wait, but PAPAW has A in position 2 and uses P twice, which is allowed.

However, let’s check if there are other words:

- B A M B O? No.  
- B A I L? 4 letters.  
- B A M? 3 letters.  

It seems PAPAW is the best choice.

But let me re-examine: the remaining letters are B, F, H, I, K, M, O, P, V, W.

Another word: B A M B O? No.  
F A I R Y? R, Y out.  
H A I R Y? R, Y out.  
M A C H O? C out.  
V A I N S? S out.  
W A I N S? S out.  

So PAPAW is the only valid 5-letter word left that fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is PAPAW.Based on the feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 2 (✓ at position 2)
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, G, U, D, Y
- Remaining common letters to test: B, F, H, I, K, M, O, P, V, W

The word must be _ A _ _ _ with only those letters allowed. A valid candidate is:

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can gain. This means selecting a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L and vowels like A, E, I, O, U are good choices.

A strategic first guess would be ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test positions and frequencies.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: x → not in word
- L: x → not in word
- A: - → in word but wrong position
- T: x → not in word
- E: x → not in word

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E
- DOES contain A, but not in the 3rd position (so A must be in 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th)
- Remaining common letters to test: R, N, I, O, U, C, H, etc.

Next guess should:
1. Include A in a different position (2nd, 4th, or 5th)
2. Introduce new common letters not yet tested
3. Avoid S, L, T, E

A good candidate is ""CRANE"":
- C, R, N are new common letters
- A is moved to 2nd position (was 3rd in SLATE)
- E is avoided (already ruled out)
- No S, L, T

So far we know:

- A _ _ _ _
Possible candidates: ABOMI, AFOUL, AFOOT (but T is out), AFOGS (S is out), etc. None of these are valid 5-letter words.

Next, try A in position 4:
- _ _ _ A _
Possible candidates: BUMPY, DUMPY, HUMPY, GUMPY, etc. These are valid but not common.

Try A in position 5:
- _ _ _ _ A
Common words ending in A: MOUTH, but T is out; DOWNS, but S is out; etc.

Looking at remaining letters, let's try ""MOUTH"":
- M, O, U, T, H
But T is already ruled out.

Next, try ""FOULS"" - but S is out.

Try ""GAUDY"":
- G, A, U, D, Y
This uses new letters (G, U, D, Y) and places A in position 2 (but A was marked as wrong position in CRANE where it was in position 3, but in CRANE it was position 2, so actually A can be in position 2? Wait, let's re-examine:

From CRANE feedback:
- CRANE: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
This means A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (it was in position 3 in CRANE). So A can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

So ""GAUDY"" has A in position 2 - this is allowed.

But let's verify:
GAUDY letters: G, A, U, D, Y - none of S, L, T, E, C, R, N are present, and A is in position 2 (allowed).

This seems like a good next guess to test G, U, D, Y and confirm A's position.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 3: GAUDY -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(✓) U(x) D(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word but **not** in position 3.

2. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word but **not** in position 3 (again).

3. GAUDY → G(x) A(✓) U(x) D(x) Y(x)  
   – A is now confirmed in position 2.

So the word looks like: _ A _ _ _

Letters **not** in the word: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, G, U, D, Y.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tested: B, F, H, I, K, M, O, P, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with A in position 2 and only letters from the allowed set.

Possible patterns: B A _ _ _, F A _ _ _, H A _ _ _, etc.

Let’s try to find a valid word:

- B A _ _ _ → BAHUM? (invalid)  
- F A _ _ _ → F A C E S? (but E, S are out)  
- H A _ _ _ → H A R D Y? (R, D, Y are out)  
- M A _ _ _ → M A C H Y? (C, Y are out)  
- P A _ _ _ → P A P A S? (S is out)  
- V A _ _ _ → V A I N S? (S is out)  
- W A _ _ _ → W A I N S? (S is out)  
- B A _ _ _ → B A I L S? (S is out)  
- B A _ _ _ → B A I L? (only 4 letters)  

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words with A in position 2 and no banned letters:

- B A _ _ _ → BAHUB? (invalid)  
- F A _ _ _ → FAINT? (I, N, T – T is out)  
- H A _ _ _ → HABIT? (I, T – T is out)  
- M A _ _ _ → MAJOR? (O, R – R is out)  
- P A _ _ _ → PAPAW? (P, W are allowed)  
- P A _ _ _ → PAPAL? (invalid)  
- V A _ _ _ → VAPOR? (O, R – R is out)  
- W A _ _ _ → WAKER? (K, E, R – E, R are out)  
- B A _ _ _ → BALMY? (M, Y – Y is out)  
- B A _ _ _ → BAZOO? (Z, O – O is allowed)  

Let’s pick a valid word: PAPAW (but W is allowed, A is in position 2, P is allowed, A, W is allowed). However, PAPAW uses P twice, which is okay.

But let’s check if PAPAW is valid: yes, it’s a 5-letter word.

However, let me think of another word that uses more unique letters: BAHUB? Not valid. How about BAZOO? That’s a valid word (though rare).

But let’s try to find a more common word: BAHUM? No.

Another approach: look for words with A in position 2 and remaining letters from the allowed set.

Looking at remaining letters: B, F, H, I, K, M, O, P, V, W.

Possible combinations:

- B A I L S? S is out.  
- B A I L? 4 letters.  
- B A M B O? 5 letters, but O is allowed. BAMB? No.  
- B A M B O? BAMB? No.  
- F A C E S? E, S are out.  
- F A I R Y? R, Y are out.  
- H A I R Y? R, Y are out.  
- M A C H O? C is out.  
- P A P A S? S is out.  
- V A I N S? S is out.  
- W A I N S? S is out.  

Wait, let’s list valid words systematically:

With A in position 2:

- B A _ _ _ → BAHUB? No. BAZOO? Yes.  
- F A _ _ _ → FAINT? T is out.  
- H A _ _ _ → HABIT? T is out.  
- M A _ _ _ → MAJOR? R is out.  
- P A _ _ _ → PAPAW? Yes.  
- V A _ _ _ → VAPOR? R is out.  
- W A _ _ _ → WAKER? K, E, R – E, R out.  

So the only valid words seem to be BAZOO and PAPAW. Between these, BAZOO uses Z and O, which are allowed. PAPAW is also valid.

Let’s choose BAZOO as it introduces Z and O.

But wait, let me double-check: BAZOO is a valid word (a type of animal). However, let’s see if there are better options.

Another word: BAHUM? No. BAHUB? No.

Let me think differently: the remaining letters include B, F, H, I, K, M, O, P, V, W.

Possible words:

- B A I L S? S is out.  
- B A I L? 4 letters.  
- B A M B O? Not a word.  
- B A M B O? No.  
- F A I R Y? R, Y out.  
- H A I R Y? R, Y out.  
- M A C H O? C out.  
- P A P A S? S out.  
- V A I N S? S out.  
- W A I N S? S out.  

It appears BAZOO is the only valid word left that fits. However, let’s verify BAZOO:

Letters: B, A, Z, O, O. None are in the banned list (S, L, T, E, C, R, N, G, U, D, Y). A is in position 2 (✓). This seems correct.

But let me think of another word: BAHUB? Not valid. BAHUM? Not valid.

Another candidate: PAPAW. Letters: P, A, P, A, W. None are banned. A is in position 2. This is valid.

Between BAZOO and PAPAW, PAPAW is more common. Let’s go with PAPAW.

Wait, but PAPAW has A in position 2 and uses P twice, which is allowed.

However, let’s check if there are other words:

- B A M B O? No.  
- B A I L? 4 letters.  
- B A M? 3 letters.  

It seems PAPAW is the best choice.

But let me re-examine: the remaining letters are B, F, H, I, K, M, O, P, V, W.

Another word: B A M B O? No.  
F A I R Y? R, Y out.  
H A I R Y? R, Y out.  
M A C H O? C out.  
V A I N S? S out.  
W A I N S? S out.  

So PAPAW is the only valid 5-letter word left that fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is PAPAW.Based on the feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 2 (✓ at position 2)
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, G, U, D, Y
- Remaining common letters to test: B, F, H, I, K, M, O, P, V, W

The word must be _ A _ _ _ with only those letters allowed. A valid candidate is:

From the new feedback on PAPAW:

- P(x) → P is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in position 2 (already known).
- P(x) → P is not in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word but NOT in position 4 (it was in position 4 in PAPAW, so this just reinforces A is not in position 4).
- W(x) → W is not in the word.

So far we know:
- A is in position 2.
- Forbidden letters: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, G, U, D, Y, P, W.
- Remaining letters that can appear: B, F, H, I, K, M, O, V, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form: _ A _ _ _ using only the allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- B A _ _ _
- F A _ _ _
- H A _ _ _
- M A _ _ _
- etc.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words that fit:

- B A _ _ _: BAHUB? No. BAZOO? Z, O allowed. BAZOO is valid.
- F A _ _ _: FAINT? T out. FABLE? B, L, E out. FAMOUS? O, U, S out. No valid.
- H A _ _ _: HABIT? T out. HUMOR? U, R out. No valid.
- M A _ _ _: MAJOR? O, R out. MAMBA? M, B allowed. MAMBA is valid.
- V A _ _ _: VAPOR? P, R out. VAGUE? U, E out. No valid.
- K A _ _ _: KAPOK? K, O, P, K. P out. No.
- B A _ _ _: BAZOO is valid.

Between BAZOO and MAMBA, MAMBA uses M, A, M, B, A. All letters are allowed (M, B are allowed; A is fixed in position 2). BAZOO uses B, A, Z, O, O. Also valid.

MAMBA seems more common. Let’s choose MAMBA.

Check letters: M, A, M, B, A. None are in the forbidden list. A is in position 2. This fits perfectly.

From the feedback on MAMBA:

- M(✓) → M is in position 1.
- A(✓) → A is in position 2.
- M(✓) → M is in position 3.
- B(x) → B is not in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in position 4.

So the secret word is now fully determined:
- Position 1: M
- Position 2: A
- Position 3: M
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: ?

Letters already ruled out include: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, G, U, D, Y, P, W, B.

Remaining possible letters for position 5: F, H, I, K, O, V, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word matching M A M A _ with one of these letters.

Valid words:
- MAMMA: uses M (allowed), but M is already in position 3 and 4, and M is allowed to repeat. MAMMA is a valid English word.
- MAMAS: S is out.
- MAMBA: B is out.
- MAMA: 4 letters.
- MAMBO: O is allowed. MAMBO is a valid word (dance).

Between MAMMA and MAMBO, MAMMA is more common and uses only allowed letters.

Therefore, the next guess is MAMMA.
