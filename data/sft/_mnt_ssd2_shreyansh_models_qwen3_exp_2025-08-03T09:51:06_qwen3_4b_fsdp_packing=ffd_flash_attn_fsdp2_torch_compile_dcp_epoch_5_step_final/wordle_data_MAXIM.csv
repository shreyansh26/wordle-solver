For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequently used in English words

This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word, helping me narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on “arose”:

A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position.  
R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x) – R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word contains the letter A (but not in the first position).
- The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has an A somewhere other than first.
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters we haven’t ruled out yet (like T, N, L, C, D, etc.).

A good next guess is “TALON” because:
- It has A in position 2 (testing new positions for A).  
- It avoids R, O, S, E entirely.  
- It introduces common consonants T, L, N to help narrow down possibilities.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequently used in English words

This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word, helping me narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>

From the feedback on “arose”:

A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position.  
R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x) – R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word contains the letter A (but not in the first position).
- The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has an A somewhere other than first.
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters we haven’t ruled out yet (like T, N, L, C, D, etc.).

A good next guess is “TALON” because:
- It has A in position 2 (testing new positions for A).  
- It avoids R, O, S, E entirely.  
- It introduces common consonants T, L, N to help narrow down possibilities.

Current known facts:
1. A is in the word and is in the 2nd position (A✓ in guess 2).
2. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, T, L, N.

We need a 5-letter word with the pattern:
_ A _ _ _

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

To maximize information, we should test new common consonants and vowels in the remaining positions. Common letters left include C, D, H, K, M, P, U, etc.

Let’s try a word that places A in the 2nd spot and uses new letters in the other positions. A good candidate is ""CABID"":
- C (new consonant)
- A (confirmed in 2nd position)
- B (new consonant)
- I (new vowel)
- D (new consonant)

This tests three new letters (C, B, I, D) while keeping A fixed in the 2nd position.

2. Letters known to be absent: R, O, S, E, T, L, N, C, B, D, H, G, Y
3. Remaining possible letters for positions 1, 3, 5: F, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2 and I in position 4.
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.
- Common remaining consonants to test: F, J, K, M, P, V, W, etc.

Possible candidates:

- K: KAIM_ – but KAIM is not a word.
- M: MAIM_ – but M is possible.
- P: PAIN_ – but N is out.
- V: VAIN_ – N is out.
- W: WAIM_ – not a word.

Looking at remaining letters, ""MAIM_"" doesn't fit. Let's think of valid words:
- ""MAIM"" is 4 letters.
- ""FAIR"" is 4 letters.
- ""PAIR"" is 4 letters.
- ""VAIN"" is 4 letters.
- ""WAIM"" is not a word.
- ""FAKE"" is out (E, K).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are present in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the most frequently used in English words

This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word, helping me narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:

A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position.  
R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x) – R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- The word contains the letter A (but not in the first position).
- The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has an A somewhere other than first.
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters we haven’t ruled out yet (like T, N, L, C, D, etc.).

A good next guess is “TALON” because:
- It has A in position 2 (testing new positions for A).  
- It avoids R, O, S, E entirely.  
- It introduces common consonants T, L, N to help narrow down possibilities.

Current known facts:
1. A is in the word and is in the 2nd position (A✓ in guess 2).
2. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, T, L, N.

We need a 5-letter word with the pattern:
_ A _ _ _

Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

To maximize information, we should test new common consonants and vowels in the remaining positions. Common letters left include C, D, H, K, M, P, U, etc.

Let’s try a word that places A in the 2nd spot and uses new letters in the other positions. A good candidate is ""CABID"":
- C (new consonant)
- A (confirmed in 2nd position)
- B (new consonant)
- I (new vowel)
- D (new consonant)

This tests three new letters (C, B, I, D) while keeping A fixed in the 2nd position.

   – R, O, S, E are absent.

2. talon → T(x) A(✓) L(x) O(x) N(x)  
   – A is in position 2 (✓).  
   – T, L, O, N are absent.

3. cabid → C(x) A(✓) B(x) I(✓) D(x)  
   – A is still in position 2 (✓).  
   – C, B, D are absent.  
   – I is in the word but not in position 4.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ A _ I _ (because I is in the word and not in position 4)
- Letters definitely absent: R, O, S, E, T, L, N, C, B, D
- Remaining possible letters: F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the vowels U and possibly Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2 and I in position 4.  
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.  
- Common remaining consonants to test: F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y.

A good candidate is ""HAGGY"":
- H (new consonant)  
- A (position 2)  
- G (new consonant)  
- I (position 4)  
- Y (new letter, can act as consonant or vowel)

This tests H, G, Y while fitting the known pattern.

From all feedback so far:

Known:
- Pattern: _ A _ I _  (A is 2nd, I is 4th)
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, T, L, N, C, B, D, H, G, Y
- Still allowed: F, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus any vowels left)

Remaining vowels: U (since A and I are already placed, E, O are ruled out)
Remaining consonants: F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word with the exact pattern _ A _ I _ using only the allowed letters.  
Possible candidates: FAVIO, JAMMY, KAPPA, MAJOR (but O and R are out), etc.  
Testing the most common remaining consonants first, ""MAJOR"" fails (O and R out).  
""JAMMY"" uses M and Y, but Y is out.  
""KAPPA"" uses P and K, but A is already placed.  
""PAVIL"" – L is out.  
""FAVOR"" – O and R are out.  
""MAJOR"" – already ruled out.  
""KAPPA"" – uses P, A, P, P, A – fits pattern _ A _ I _ with K in 1st and 5th positions? No, pattern is 1st, 2nd=A, 3rd, 4th=I, 5th.  
Wait, pattern is _ A _ I _, so positions: 1, 2=A, 3, 4=I, 5.  
So we need letters 1, 3, 5 from remaining set.  
Possible: M, A, P, I, P – but P is allowed.  
But we need to test new letters.  
Looking at remaining: F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, U, X, Z.  
Best candidate: ""MAKIN"" – but N is out.  
""JAPAN"" – N is out.  
""KAPPA"" – P is allowed, K is allowed.  
""KAPPA"" fits _ A _ I _? No, it's K A P P A – positions: 1=K, 2=A, 3=P, 4=P, 5=A – doesn't fit _ A _ I _ because 4th must be I.  
Oops, need 4th letter I.  
So pattern: [consonant] A [consonant or vowel] I [consonant or vowel]  
But I is already in 4th, so 3rd can be consonant or vowel.  
Looking for words like: [allowed] A [allowed] I [allowed].  
Possible: ""MAVIN"" – N is out.  
""PAVIL"" – L is out.  
""KAPPA"" – no, doesn't fit.  
""JAPAN"" – N is out.  
""VAPID"" – D is out.  
""JAMMY"" – Y is out.  
""MAJOR"" – O and R are out.  
""FAVOR"" – O and R are out.  
""PAVIL"" – L is out.  
""KAPPA"" – no.  
""MAIKI"" – K and I are allowed, but K is allowed, I is allowed.  
""MAIKI"" – is this a valid word? Probably not.  
""MAKIN"" – N is out.  
""MAJIK"" – J is allowed, K is allowed.  
""MAJIK"" – but J is allowed, K is allowed.  
But ""MAJIK"" is 5 letters: M A J I K – fits _ A _ I _ pattern exactly.  
Letters used: M, A, J, I, K – all allowed.  
So ""MAJIK"" is a valid guess.
