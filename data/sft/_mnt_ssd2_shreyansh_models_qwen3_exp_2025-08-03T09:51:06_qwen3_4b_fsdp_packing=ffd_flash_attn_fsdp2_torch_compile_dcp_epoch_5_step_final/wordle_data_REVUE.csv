### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).

After considering options, ""AROSE"" seems like a strong first guess because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present and their possible positions.

From the feedback on “arose”:

- A (x) → A is NOT in the word.  
- R (-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- O (x) → O is NOT in the word.  
- S (x) → S is NOT in the word.  
- E (✓) → E is in the word AND in position 5.  

So the secret word ends with E and contains R somewhere (but not in position 2).  
We now need a 5-letter word that ends with E, contains R (not in position 2), and avoids A, O, S.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, etc.  
I’ll pick a word that places R in a new spot (positions 1, 3, or 4) and uses other common letters.

A strong candidate is “TRIED”:
- T (new consonant)  
- R (must be in the word, now in position 2 → but feedback says R is NOT in position 2 → so TRIED is invalid because R would be in position 2 again).  
Oops, that’s no good.

Next candidate: “CREPE” – but that repeats E and C is less common.

Better: “TREND” – but ends with D, not E.

Another: “RINSE” – but S is already excluded.

Try “TERNE” (an archaic spelling of “tarn”), but it’s obscure.

Instead, let’s place R in position 3 and use fresh letters.  
Word: “BREAD” – but A is excluded.

“CRANE” – A excluded.

“DRIER” – repeats R and I is new.

“FRERE” – repeats R and E.

“PRIER” – repeats R and I.

“TIGER” – G is new, but ends with R, not E.

“VIRGE” – G is new, ends with E, R in position 4 (valid).  
This seems good: letters are V, I, R, G, E – all new except R and E.  
R is in position 4 (not 2), E is in position 5, and we avoid A, O, S.

So I’ll guess “VIRGE”.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing R and V, with R not in positions 2 or 3 and V not in position 1.

Possible positions for R: 1 or 4 (since 2 and 3 are excluded).
Possible positions for V: 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but 5 is E), so 2, 3, or 4.
