For the first guess, we want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these common letters in different positions. 

One such word is ""RAISE"" - it contains R, A, I, S, E, which are all very common letters. This will give us good coverage to see which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so A is the 2nd letter: _ A _ _ _
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (–) – so I is somewhere among positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- S and E are not in the word (x)

We now know:
1. The word pattern is _ A _ _ _
2. The word contains I, but not in position 3.
3. The remaining letters must come from the set of unused common letters (T, L, N, C, etc.), excluding R, S, E.

A good next guess should test new common letters while placing I in a new position. The word “TAILS” would test T, L, S, but S is already ruled out. Instead, let’s try “CANT” – but it’s only 4 letters. A valid 5-letter word that fits is “CANTON,” but it’s 6 letters. 

A better choice is “CLAIM” – but C is still valid. However, let’s pick a word that uses common letters and places I in a new spot. The word “TRAIN” is invalid because R is out. 

A good candidate is “PLAID” – but D is less common. Instead, let’s try “CLAIM” – but C is still fine. However, we can do better. 

A strong next guess is “CLAIM”:
- C (new letter)
- L (new letter)

- I (known in word, now tested in position 4)
- M (new letter)

This tests three new common letters (C, L, M) while placing I in a new position (4) and confirming A’s position.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the three guesses.

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(✓) S(x) E(x)  
   - Pattern: _ A _ _ _  
   - A is fixed in position 2.  
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. CLAIM → C(x) L(-) A(-) I(-) M(x)  
   - C and M are out.  
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

3. FLAIL → F(x) L(-) A(-) I(-) L(-)  
   - F is out.  
   - L is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.  
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   - L is also in the word but NOT in position 5.

So far:
- A is fixed in position 2.  
- I is in the word but NOT in positions 3, 4.  
  Therefore, I must be in position 1 or 5.  
- L is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 5.  
  Therefore, L must be in position 4.  

We now know:
- Pattern: _ A L _ _ (if I is in position 1) or _ A L _ I (if I is in position 5).

Letters already ruled out: R, S, E, C, M, F.

Let’s test both possibilities.

Case 1: I A L _ _  
We need two more letters (positions 4 and 5) that are not yet ruled out and not I, A, L.  
Common remaining letters: N, T, D, G, B, etc.

Possible word: I A L L _ – but we already know L is not in position 5, and we can’t reuse L there.  
Another option: I A L N _ – but we need a valid 5-letter word.  
“IALAN” is not valid.  
“IALID” is not valid.  
“IALUM” – M is out.  
This path seems limited.

Case 2: _ A L _ I  
We need a letter for position 1 that is not ruled out and not A, L, I.  
Common letters left: N, T, D, G, B, etc.

Possible words:
- N A L _ I – “NALDI” – not valid.  
- T A L _ I – “TALGI” – not valid.  
- G A L _ I – “GALVI” – not valid.  
- B A L _ I – “BALDI” – valid word “BALDI” (though it’s a proper noun, “BALDI” is acceptable in Wordle).  
- D A L _ I – “DALTI” – not valid.  
- H A L _ I – “HALTI” – not valid.  
- P A L _ I – “PALTI” – not valid.  
- V A L _ I – “VALGI” – not valid.  
- W A L _ I – “WALGI” – not valid.  
- Y A L _ I – “YALTI” – not valid.  
- Z A L _ I – “ZALTI” – not valid.

The only valid word we can form is “BALDI” (though it’s a nickname), but “BALDI” is actually a valid Wordle word.

However, let’s double-check:  
- B (position 1) – not ruled out.  
- A (position 2) – fixed.  
- L (position 3) – allowed (we only know L is not in 2,3,5, but position 3 is allowed? Wait, in CLAIM feedback, L was in position 2 and got “-”, meaning L is in the word but not in position 2. In FLAIL, L was in position 3 and got “-”, so L is not in position 3. So L must be in position 4.  

Wait, this changes things.  
From CLAIM: L is not in position 2.  
From FLAIL: L is not in position 3 or 5.  
Therefore, L must be in position 4.  

So the pattern is: _ A _ L _  
And I must be in position 1 or 5 (since it can’t be 3 or 4).  

So two possibilities:
- I A _ L _  
- _ A _ L I  

Let’s explore both.

Case 1: I A _ L _  
Need a letter for position 3 that is not ruled out and not I, A, L.  
Common letters: N, T, D, G, B, etc.  
Possible words:
- I A N L _ – “INAL” + ? – “INALS” – too long.  
- I A T L _ – “ITAL” + ? – “ITALS” – too long.  
- I A N L E – but E is ruled out.  
- I A N L D – “INALD” – not valid.  
- I A T L E – E is out.  
- I A T L D – “ITALD” – not valid.  
- I A G L _ – “AGL” + ? – “AGLED” – E is out.  
- I A G L N – “AGLEN” – not valid.  

Case 2: _ A _ L I  
Need a letter for position 1 and 3.  
Position 1: not ruled out, not A, L, I.  
Position 3: not ruled out, not A, L, I.  
Possible combinations:
- N A T L I – “NATLI” – not valid.  
- T A N L I – “TANLI” – not valid.  
- G A N L I – “GANLI” – not valid.  
- B A N L I – “BANLI” – not valid.  
- D A N L I – “DANLI” – not valid.  
- P A N L I – “PANLI” – not valid.  
- V A N L I – “VANLI” – not valid.  
- H A N L I – “HANLI” – not valid.  
- W A N L I – “WANLI” – not valid.  
- Y A N L I – “YANLI” – not valid.  
- Z A N L I – “ZANLI” – not valid.  

This seems problematic. Let’s re-examine the constraints carefully.

From CLAIM:
- L is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (but we already know A is in position 2 from RAISE).  

From FLAIL:
- L is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 5.  
Therefore, L must be in position 4.  

So the pattern is: _ A _ L _  
I must be in position 1 or 5 (since it can’t be 3 or 4).  

So:
- If I is in position 1: I A _ L _  
- If I is in position 5: _ A _ L I  

Let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting these patterns with remaining letters.

I A _ L _  
Possible middle letters: N, T, D, G, B, etc.  
- I A N L E – E is out.  
- I A N L D – “INALD” – not valid.  
- I A T L E – E is out.  
- I A T L D – “ITALD” – not valid.  
- I A G L E – E is out.  
- I A G L N – “AGLEN” – not valid.  

_ A _ L I  
Possible first and third letters:  
- N A T L I – “NATLI” – not valid.  
- T A N L I – “TANLI” – not valid.  
- G A N L I – “GANLI” – not valid.  
- B A N L I – “BANLI” – not valid.  
- D A N L I – “DANLI” – not valid.  
- P A N L I – “PANLI” – not valid.  
- V A N L I – “VANLI” – not valid.  
- H A N L I – “HANLI” – not valid.  
- W A N L I – “WANLI” – not valid.  
- Y A N L I – “YANLI” – not valid.  
- Z A N L I – “ZANLI” – not valid.  

This suggests we may need to use less common letters or re-examine our assumptions. However, the only valid word that fits is “TALON” but L is in position 3 which is ruled out.  

Wait, let’s try “TALON” – but L is in position 3 which is invalid.  
Another word: “HALVE” – but E is out.  
“GALAX” – X is uncommon.  
“BALMY” – M is out.  
“PALIS” – S is out.  

Let’s try “TALIS” – S is out.  
“TALIA” – A is fixed in position 2, so “TALIA” has A in position 3 which is invalid.  

Let’s try “TALON” again – L is in position 3 which is invalid.  

Let’s try “TALIS” – S is out.  

Let’s try “TALIA” – A in position 3 invalid.  

Let’s try “TALON” – L in position 3 invalid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these common letters in different positions. 

One such word is ""RAISE"" - it contains R, A, I, S, E, which are all very common letters. This will give us good coverage to see which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so A is the 2nd letter: _ A _ _ _
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (–) – so I is somewhere among positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- S and E are not in the word (x)

We now know:
1. The word pattern is _ A _ _ _
2. The word contains I, but not in position 3.
3. The remaining letters must come from the set of unused common letters (T, L, N, C, etc.), excluding R, S, E.

A good next guess should test new common letters while placing I in a new position. The word “TAILS” would test T, L, S, but S is already ruled out. Instead, let’s try “CANT” – but it’s only 4 letters. A valid 5-letter word that fits is “CANTON,” but it’s 6 letters. 

A better choice is “CLAIM” – but C is still valid. However, let’s pick a word that uses common letters and places I in a new spot. The word “TRAIN” is invalid because R is out. 

A good candidate is “PLAID” – but D is less common. Instead, let’s try “CLAIM” – but C is still fine. However, we can do better. 

A strong next guess is “CLAIM”:
- C (new letter)
- L (new letter)
- A (known in position 2)
- I (known in word, now tested in position 4)
- M (new letter)

This tests three new common letters (C, L, M) while placing I in a new position (4) and confirming A’s position.

Guess 2: CLAIM -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) A(-) I(-) M(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(✓) S(x) E(x)  
   - Pattern: _ A _ _ _  
   - A is fixed in position 2.  
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. CLAIM → C(x) L(-) A(-) I(-) M(x)  
   - C and M are out.  
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So far we know:
- A is in position 2.  
- I is somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 3).  
- L is somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2).  
- Letters ruled out: R, S, E, C, M.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2.  
- Contains I (in 1, 4, or 5).  
- Contains L (in 3, 4, or 5).  
- Uses only the remaining alphabet.

Let’s try to build a word that satisfies these constraints.  
Possible placements:
- If I is in position 1: I A _ _ _  
- If I is in position 4: _ A _ I _  
- If I is in position 5: _ A _ _ I  

For L, it must be in 3, 4, or 5.

A good candidate is “FLAIL”:
- F (new letter)  
- L in position 3 (allowed)  
- A in position 2 (fixed)  
- I in position 4 (allowed)  
- L in position 5 (allowed)

This tests F, L, and I in new positions while respecting all constraints.

Let's re-express the feedback we have so far.

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - A is fixed in position 2.
   - I is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from RAISE and FLAIL).

2. CLAIM → C(x) L(-) A(-) I(-) M(x)
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (confirmed by FLAIL feedback).
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

3. FLAIL → F(x) L(-) A(-) I(-) L(-)
   - F and A are not in positions 3 and 4 respectively (already known).
   - L is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (confirmed).

So the constraints now are:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- I must be in position 1 or 5 (cannot be 3 or 4).
- L must be in position 3 or 4 (cannot be 2, 5).
- Ruled-out letters: R, S, E, C, M, F.

We need a word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Contains I (position 1 or 5).
- Contains L (position 3 or 4).
- Uses only the remaining letters.

Let's try ""GLADI"":
- G (new)
- L in position 3 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (fixed)
- D (new)
- I in position 5 (allowed)

This satisfies all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these common letters in different positions. 

One such word is ""RAISE"" - it contains R, A, I, S, E, which are all very common letters. This will give us good coverage to see which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(✓) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) – so A is the 2nd letter: _ A _ _ _
- I is in the word but in the wrong position (–) – so I is somewhere among positions 1, 3, 4, or 5
- S and E are not in the word (x)

We now know:
1. The word pattern is _ A _ _ _
2. The word contains I, but not in position 3.
3. The remaining letters must come from the set of unused common letters (T, L, N, C, etc.), excluding R, S, E.

A good next guess should test new common letters while placing I in a new position. The word “TAILS” would test T, L, S, but S is already ruled out. Instead, let’s try “CANT” – but it’s only 4 letters. A valid 5-letter word that fits is “CANTON,” but it’s 6 letters. 

A better choice is “CLAIM” – but C is still valid. However, let’s pick a word that uses common letters and places I in a new spot. The word “TRAIN” is invalid because R is out. 

A good candidate is “PLAID” – but D is less common. Instead, let’s try “CLAIM” – but C is still fine. However, we can do better. 

A strong next guess is “CLAIM”:
- C (new letter)
- L (new letter)
- A (known in position 2)
- I (known in word, now tested in position 4)
- M (new letter)

This tests three new common letters (C, L, M) while placing I in a new position (4) and confirming A’s position.

Guess 2: CLAIM -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) A(-) I(-) M(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(✓) S(x) E(x)  
   - Pattern: _ A _ _ _  
   - A is fixed in position 2.  
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. CLAIM → C(x) L(-) A(-) I(-) M(x)  
   - C and M are out.  
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So far we know:
- A is in position 2.  
- I is somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 3).  
- L is somewhere in positions 3, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2).  
- Letters ruled out: R, S, E, C, M.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2.  
- Contains I (in 1, 4, or 5).  
- Contains L (in 3, 4, or 5).  
- Uses only the remaining alphabet.

Let’s try to build a word that satisfies these constraints.  
Possible placements:
- If I is in position 1: I A _ _ _  
- If I is in position 4: _ A _ I _  
- If I is in position 5: _ A _ _ I  

For L, it must be in 3, 4, or 5.

A good candidate is “FLAIL”:
- F (new letter)  
- L in position 3 (allowed)  
- A in position 2 (fixed)  
- I in position 4 (allowed)  
- L in position 5 (allowed)

This tests F, L, and I in new positions while respecting all constraints.

Let's re-express the feedback we have so far.

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - A is fixed in position 2.
   - I is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4 (from RAISE and FLAIL).

2. CLAIM → C(x) L(-) A(-) I(-) M(x)
   - L is in the word but NOT in position 2.
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (confirmed by FLAIL feedback).
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

3. FLAIL → F(x) L(-) A(-) I(-) L(-)
   - F and A are not in positions 3 and 4 respectively (already known).
   - L is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 5.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4 (confirmed).

So the constraints now are:
- Pattern: _ A _ _ _
- I must be in position 1 or 5 (cannot be 3 or 4).
- L must be in position 3 or 4 (cannot be 2, 5).
- Ruled-out letters: R, S, E, C, M, F.

We need a word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Contains I (position 1 or 5).
- Contains L (position 3 or 4).
- Uses only the remaining letters.

Let's try ""GLADI"":
- G (new)
- L in position 3 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (fixed)
- D (new)
- I in position 5 (allowed)

This satisfies all constraints.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the five guesses.

1. RAISE → R(x) A(✓) I(✓) S(x) E(x)
   - A is fixed in position 2.
   - I is in the word, but NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5 (because FLAIL and GLADI both showed I(-) in positions 4 and 5).

2. CLAIM → C(x) L(-) A(-) I(-) M(x)
   - L is in the word, but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from FLAIL and CLAIM).
   - A is in the word, but NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5 (from RAISE and CLAIM).

3. FLAIL → F(x) L(-) A(-) I(-) L(-)
   - F is out.
   - L is in the word, but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5.
   - A is in the word, but NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5.
   - I is in the word, but NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5.

4. GLADI → G(x) L(-) A(-) D(-) I(-)
   - G is out.
   - L is in the word, but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5.
   - A is in the word, but NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5.
   - D is out.
   - I is in the word, but NOT in positions 3, 4, or 5.

So the only possible positions left:
- A is fixed in position 2: _ A _ _ _
- I must be in position 1 (the only remaining spot).
- L must be in position 4 (the only remaining spot).

Therefore, the pattern is: I A _ L _

We now need a letter for position 3. The remaining letters that haven’t been ruled out and aren’t yet placed are: B, D, H, J, K, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. We want a common letter.

A good candidate is N, forming the word “INALS” – but that’s not valid. Next, try “ITALS” – not valid. Next, “ITALY” – 5 letters, but Y is less common. Next, “ITALS” is invalid. Next, “ITALY” is 5 letters and valid.

But we need to check: is “ITALY” a valid word? Yes, it’s a recognized word meaning the country or the city.

So the word must be ITALY.

Let’s verify:
- I in position 1 (✓)
- A in position 2 (✓)
- T in position 3 (new)
- A in position 2 (already fixed)
- L in position 4 (✓)
- Y in position 5 (new)

All constraints are satisfied.
