For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must appear in positions 2-5).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S somewhere after the first letter.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
2. Avoids L, A, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, D, M, P, B, G, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A strong candidate is ""SHORN"":
- S in position 1 is ruled out by the feedback (S was in position 1 and was marked as wrong position, so S must be in 2-5). So S cannot be in position 1. Therefore, ""SHORN"" is invalid because it starts with S.

Next candidate: ""DRIPS"":
- S is in position 5 (valid).
- D, R, I, P are all new letters.
- Avoids L, A, T, E.

This seems like a good second guess to test new letters while keeping S in a valid position.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must appear in positions 2-5).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S somewhere after the first letter.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
2. Avoids L, A, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, D, M, P, B, G, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A strong candidate is ""SHORN"":
- S in position 1 is ruled out by the feedback (S was in position 1 and was marked as wrong position, so S must be in 2-5). So S cannot be in position 1. Therefore, ""SHORN"" is invalid because it starts with S.

Next candidate: ""DRIPS"":
- S is in position 5 (valid).
- D, R, I, P are all new letters.
- Avoids L, A, T, E.

This seems like a good second guess to test new letters while keeping S in a valid position.

So far we know:
- S is in the word and is in position 5 (last letter).
- Letters L, A, T, E, D, R, I, P are NOT in the word.

We need a 5-letter word where:
- The last letter is S.
- All other letters are from the remaining alphabet (avoiding L, A, T, E, D, R, I, P).

Remaining common consonants: N, C, H, M, B, F, G, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: O, U (since A, E, I are out).

A good next guess should introduce several new letters to narrow things down quickly. Let’s look for a word ending in S that uses fresh letters.

Candidate: “CHUNKS” – too long.
Candidate: “MONGS” – but G and N are new, but O is new too.
Candidate: “FOGGY” – ends in Y, not S.
Candidate: “COYS” – too short.
Candidate: “BOGS” – 4 letters.
Candidate: “HOGS” – 4 letters.
Candidate: “WOMBS” – uses W, O, M, B, S. All letters are new (avoiding the forbidden set) and fit the constraints.

“WOMBS” ends in S, and uses W, O, M, B – none of which have been tested yet.

We now have four letters locked in place:

Position 1: B (✓)
Position 2: O (✓)
Position 3: N (✓)
Position 4: ? (K was tried and marked x, so it’s NOT here)
Position 5: S (✓)

So the pattern is: B O N _ S

We need a single letter for position 4 that:
- Has NOT been ruled out (forbidden letters so far: L, A, T, E, D, R, I, P, W, M, K)
- Has NOT been used already (B, O, N, S are already placed)
- Must be a valid letter in English spelling to make a real 5-letter word.

Remaining consonants that haven’t appeared: C, F, G, H, J, V, X, Y, Z
Remaining vowels that haven’t appeared: U (A, E, I, O are already accounted for)

Let’s test each:

C → BONCS (invalid, not a word)
F → BONFS (invalid)
G → BONGS (valid word)
H → BONHS (invalid)
J → BONJS (invalid)
V → BONVS (invalid)
X → BONXS (invalid)
Y → BONYs (invalid)
Z → BONZs (invalid)

Only G makes a valid English word: BONGS.

Let’s check if any other letter could work:
- U would give BONUS, but position 4 is consonant-heavy and U is vowel, and we have O already in position 2. BONUS is a valid word and fits the pattern B O N U S. However, U has not been ruled out, and we haven’t tested it yet.

But we know from earlier that only consonants and remaining vowels are allowed. Between G and U:

- BONGS is a valid word.
- BONUS is also a valid word.

We have two possible candidates. To maximize information, we can pick the one that introduces a new letter we haven’t tested. Both G and U are new.

Between them, G is more common in position 4, so let’s choose BONGS first.

If BONGS doesn’t work, we can try BONUS next.

But since we have only one guess left in this sequence (we have 4 guesses already and 6 allowed), we should pick the most likely one.

BONGS seems slightly more common than BONUS in word-guessing contexts. However, both are equally valid.

Let’s go with BONGS as the next guess.

- Has NOT been used already (B, O, N, S are already placed)
- Must be a valid letter in English spelling to make a real 5-letter word.

Remaining consonants that haven’t appeared: C, F, G, H, J, V, X, Y, Z
Remaining vowels that haven’t appeared: U (A, E, I, O are already accounted for)

Let’s test each:

C → BONCS (invalid, not a word)
F → BONFS (invalid)
G → BONGS (valid word)
H → BONHS (invalid)
J → BONJS (invalid)
V → BONVS (invalid)
X → BONXS (invalid)
Y → BONYs (invalid)
Z → BONZs (invalid)

Only G makes a valid English word: BONGS.

Let’s check if any other letter could work:
- U would give BONUS, but position 4 is consonant-heavy and U is vowel, and we have O already in position 2. BONUS is a valid word and fits the pattern B O N U S. However, U has not been ruled out, and we haven’t tested it yet.

But we know from earlier that only consonants and remaining vowels are allowed. Between G and U:

- BONGS is a valid word.
- BONUS is also a valid word.

We have two possible candidates. To maximize information, we can pick the one that introduces a new letter we haven’t tested. Both G and U are new.

Between them, G is more common in position 4, so let’s choose BONGS first.

If BONGS doesn’t work, we can try BONUS next.

But since we have only one guess left in this sequence (we have 4 guesses already and 6 allowed), we should pick the most likely one.

BONGS seems slightly more common than BONUS in word-guessing contexts. However, both are equally valid.

Let’s go with BONGS as the next guess.",Guess 5: BONGS -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) O(✓) N(✓) G(x) S(✓),FAIL

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1, so it must appear in positions 2-5).
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains S somewhere after the first letter.
- Does NOT contain L, A, T, E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
2. Avoids L, A, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

Good remaining consonants: R, N, C, H, D, M, P, B, G, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out).

A strong candidate is ""SHORN"":
- S in position 1 is ruled out by the feedback (S was in position 1 and was marked as wrong position, so S must be in 2-5). So S cannot be in position 1. Therefore, ""SHORN"" is invalid because it starts with S.

Next candidate: ""DRIPS"":
- S is in position 5 (valid).
- D, R, I, P are all new letters.
- Avoids L, A, T, E.

This seems like a good second guess to test new letters while keeping S in a valid position.

Guess 2: DRIPS -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(x) I(x) P(x) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
So far we know:
- S is in the word and is in position 5 (last letter).
- Letters L, A, T, E, D, R, I, P are NOT in the word.

We need a 5-letter word where:
- The last letter is S.
- All other letters are from the remaining alphabet (avoiding L, A, T, E, D, R, I, P).

Remaining common consonants: N, C, H, M, B, F, G, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: O, U (since A, E, I are out).

A good next guess should introduce several new letters to narrow things down quickly. Let’s look for a word ending in S that uses fresh letters.

Candidate: “CHUNKS” – too long.
Candidate: “MONGS” – but G and N are new, but O is new too.
Candidate: “FOGGY” – ends in Y, not S.
Candidate: “COYS” – too short.
Candidate: “BOGS” – 4 letters.
Candidate: “HOGS” – 4 letters.
Candidate: “WOMBS” – uses W, O, M, B, S. All letters are new (avoiding the forbidden set) and fit the constraints.

“WOMBS” ends in S, and uses W, O, M, B – none of which have been tested yet.

Guess 3: WOMBS -> FEEDBACK: W(x) O(✓) M(x) B(-) S(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. S is in the word and is in position 5 (last letter).
2. O is in the word and is in position 2 (second letter).
3. B is in the word but is in the wrong position (it was in position 4, so it must be in position 1 or 3).
4. Letters that are NOT in the word: L, A, T, E, D, R, I, P, W, M.

So the pattern we are trying to fill is: _ O _ _ S with B somewhere in position 1 or 3.

Possible positions for B:
- If B is in position 1: B O _ _ S
- If B is in position 3: _ O B _ S

We need to test which of these is correct. Let's look for a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only remaining letters (avoiding the forbidden set).

Remaining consonants: C, F, G, H, J, K, N, Q, V, X, Y, Z
Remaining vowels: U (since A, E, I, O are in use, and we know O is in position 2)

Let's try the pattern B O _ _ S first:
- B O C _ S: ""BOCSS"" is invalid (double S)
- B O G _ S: ""BOGGS"" is invalid (double G)
- B O N _ S: ""BONDS"" - but D is forbidden
- B O K _ S: ""BOKES"" - E is forbidden
- B O H _ S: ""BOHAS"" - A is forbidden
- B O F _ S: ""BOFES"" - E is forbidden
- B O N _ S: ""BONKS"" - uses K (allowed) and N (allowed)
  - ""BONKS"" fits: B O N K S
  - Check letters: B, O, N, K, S - none are forbidden except K and N haven't been tested yet, but they are allowed.

Let's try ""BONKS"" as the next guess.

If this doesn't work, we can then try the pattern _ O B _ S:
- C O B _ S: ""COBBS"" - double B and S is already in position 5
- F O B _ S: ""FOBES"" - E is forbidden
- G O B _ S: ""GOBS"" - too short
- H O B _ S: ""HOBS"" - too short
- J O B _ S: ""JOBS"" - too short
- N O B _ S: ""NOBS"" - too short
- V O B _ S: ""VOBS"" - too short
- Y O B _ S: ""YOBS"" - too short

""BONKS"" seems to be the best next guess as it fits the B O _ _ S pattern and uses allowed letters.

We now have four letters locked in place:

Position 1: B (✓)
Position 2: O (✓)
Position 3: N (✓)
Position 4: ? (K was tried and marked x, so it’s NOT here)
Position 5: S (✓)

So the pattern is: B O N _ S

We need a single letter for position 4 that:
- Has NOT been ruled out (forbidden letters so far: L, A, T, E, D, R, I, P, W, M, K)
- Has NOT been used already (B, O, N, S are already placed)
- Must be a valid letter in English spelling to make a real 5-letter word.

Remaining consonants that haven’t appeared: C, F, G, H, J, V, X, Y, Z
Remaining vowels that haven’t appeared: U (A, E, I, O are already accounted for)

Let’s test each:

C → BONCS (invalid, not a word)
F → BONFS (invalid)
G → BONGS (valid word)
H → BONHS (invalid)
J → BONJS (invalid)
V → BONVS (invalid)
X → BONXS (invalid)
Y → BONYs (invalid)
Z → BONZs (invalid)

Only G makes a valid English word: BONGS.

Let’s check if any other letter could work:
- U would give BONUS, but position 4 is consonant-heavy and U is vowel, and we have O already in position 2. BONUS is a valid word and fits the pattern B O N U S. However, U has not been ruled out, and we haven’t tested it yet.

But we know from earlier that only consonants and remaining vowels are allowed. Between G and U:

But since we have only one guess left in this sequence (we have 4 guesses already and 6 allowed), we should pick the most likely one.

BONGS seems slightly more common than BONUS in word-guessing contexts. However, both are equally valid.

Let’s go with BONGS as the next guess.
