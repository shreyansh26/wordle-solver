### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word should have frequently used consonants and vowels. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

After considering these options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps test vowel positions
2. It has common consonants (R, S)
3. It's a valid English word
4. It can help identify which vowels are present and their positions

This should give us good initial information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(x): R is not in the word at all
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3
- S(x): S is not in the word
- E(x): E is not in the word

Key deductions:
1. Letters to avoid: R, S, E
2. Letters we know are in the word: A and O
3. A cannot be in position 1, O cannot be in position 3

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and O
- Does NOT contain R, S, E
- Uses A not in position 1 and O not in position 3

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y
Possible vowels left: A, I, U (O is already known to be present)

Let's try a word that places A in a different position and O in a different position. A good candidate is ""COULD"":
- C, O, U, L, D
- Contains O (not in position 3) and A is not present, so we need another word.

Next candidate: ""PAINT"" - but E is not in the word, but P, A, I, N, T - A is in position 2, O is not in the word.

Next candidate: ""PLAID"" - P, L, A, I, D - A is in position 3, but O is not in the word.

Next candidate: ""MOUNT"" - M, O, U, N, T - O is in position 2 (not 3), A is not in the word.

Next candidate: ""PAINT"" - already checked.

Next candidate: ""ABOUT"" - A is in position 1 (forbidden), O is in position 2 (allowed), but A is in position 1 (forbidden).

Next candidate: ""COBIA"" - C, O, B, I, A - A is in position 5 (allowed), O is in position 2 (allowed), no R/S/E.

The feedback from Guess 2 (""cohiba"") was that the model answer is not five letters, so ""cohiba"" is invalid (it's six letters). I need to choose a valid five-letter word.

From Guess 1 (arose → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)):
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: A (not in position 1) and O (not in position 3)

So the secret word must contain both A and O, must not contain R, S, or E, and must place A somewhere other than position 1 and O somewhere other than position 3.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y
Possible vowels left: A, I, U (O is already required)

Let's try to form words that fit these constraints. A good candidate is ""PAINT"":
- P, A, I, N, T
- Contains A (position 2, allowed) and O is missing → but we know O must be present, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""ABOUT"":
- A is in position 1 (forbidden), so invalid.

Next: ""COBIA"":
- C, O, B, I, A
- O is in position 2 (allowed), A is in position 5 (allowed)
- No R, S, or E
- Valid five-letter word

This seems to fit all constraints.

<guess>cohiba</guess> (invalid - must be five",cohiba,"The feedback from Guess 2 (""cohiba"") was that the model answer is not five letters, so ""cohiba"" is invalid (it's six letters). I need to choose a valid five-letter word.

From Guess 1 (arose → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)):
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: A (not in position 1) and O (not in position 3)

So the secret word must contain both A and O, must not contain R, S, or E, and must place A somewhere other than position 1 and O somewhere other than position 3.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y
Possible vowels left: A, I, U (O is already required)

Let's try to form words that fit these constraints. A good candidate is ""PAINT"":
- P, A, I, N, T
- Contains A (position 2, allowed) and O is missing → but we know O must be present, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""ABOUT"":
- A is in position 1 (forbidden), so invalid.

Next: ""COBIA"":
- C, O, B, I, A
- O is in position 2 (allowed), A is in position 5 (allowed)
- No R, S, or E
- Valid five-letter word

This seems to fit all constraints.",Guess 3: cohiba -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.,FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word should have frequently used consonants and vowels. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

After considering these options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps test vowel positions
2. It has common consonants (R, S)
3. It's a valid English word
4. It can help identify which vowels are present and their positions

This should give us good initial information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(x): R is not in the word at all
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3
- S(x): S is not in the word
- E(x): E is not in the word

Key deductions:
1. Letters to avoid: R, S, E
2. Letters we know are in the word: A and O
3. A cannot be in position 1, O cannot be in position 3

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and O
- Does NOT contain R, S, E
- Uses A not in position 1 and O not in position 3

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y
Possible vowels left: A, I, U (O is already known to be present)

Let's try a word that places A in a different position and O in a different position. A good candidate is ""COULD"":
- C, O, U, L, D
- Contains O (not in position 3) and A is not present, so we need another word.

Next candidate: ""PAINT"" - but E is not in the word, but P, A, I, N, T - A is in position 2, O is not in the word.

Next candidate: ""PLAID"" - P, L, A, I, D - A is in position 3, but O is not in the word.

Next candidate: ""MOUNT"" - M, O, U, N, T - O is in position 2 (not 3), A is not in the word.

Next candidate: ""PAINT"" - already checked.

Next candidate: ""ABOUT"" - A is in position 1 (forbidden), O is in position 2 (allowed), but A is in position 1 (forbidden).

Next candidate: ""COBIA"" - C, O, B, I, A - A is in position 5 (allowed), O is in position 2 (allowed), no R/S/E.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

The feedback from Guess 2 (""cohiba"") was that the model answer is not five letters, so ""cohiba"" is invalid (it's six letters). I need to choose a valid five-letter word.

From Guess 1 (arose → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)):
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: A (not in position 1) and O (not in position 3)

So the secret word must contain both A and O, must not contain R, S, or E, and must place A somewhere other than position 1 and O somewhere other than position 3.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y
Possible vowels left: A, I, U (O is already required)

Let's try to form words that fit these constraints. A good candidate is ""PAINT"":
- P, A, I, N, T
- Contains A (position 2, allowed) and O is missing → but we know O must be present, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""ABOUT"":
- A is in position 1 (forbidden), so invalid.

Next: ""COBIA"":
- C, O, B, I, A
- O is in position 2 (allowed), A is in position 5 (allowed)
- No R, S, or E
- Valid five-letter word

This seems to fit all constraints.

Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word should have frequently used consonants and vowels. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

After considering these options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps test vowel positions
2. It has common consonants (R, S)
3. It's a valid English word
4. It can help identify which vowels are present and their positions

This should give us good initial information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

- R(x): R is not in the word at all
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3

Key deductions:

Let's try a word that places A in a different position and O in a different position. A good candidate is ""COULD"":
- C, O, U, L, D
- Contains O (not in position 3) and A is not present, so we need another word.

Next candidate: ""PAINT"" - but E is not in the word, but P, A, I, N, T - A is in position 2, O is not in the word.

Next candidate: ""PLAID"" - P, L, A, I, D - A is in position 3, but O is not in the word.

Next candidate: ""MOUNT"" - M, O, U, N, T - O is in position 2 (not 3), A is not in the word.

Next candidate: ""PAINT"" - already checked.

From the new feedback on Guess 4 (""cohib""):

C(x)  → C is not in the word  
O(✓)  → O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2)  
H(x)  → H is not in the word  
I(x)  → I is not in the word  
B(x)  → B is not in the word  

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E, C, H, I, B  
- Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct position: O at position 2  
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are unknown: A (from Guess 1)  

Therefore the word looks like: _ O _ _ _

The remaining letters we can still use (not yet ruled out) are: A, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know from Guess 1 that A is in the word but not in position 1. So A must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s try to find a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2  
- Contains A (in position 3, 4, or 5)  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no R, S, E, C, H, I, B)

A good candidate is “GONAD”:

- A is in position 4 (allowed)

- Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct position: O at position 2  
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are unknown: A (from Guess 1)  

Therefore the word looks like: _ O _ _ _

The remaining letters we can still use (not yet ruled out) are: A, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know from Guess 1 that A is in the word but not in position 1. So A must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5.

Let’s try to find a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2  
- Contains A (in position 3, 4, or 5)  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no R, S, E, C, H, I, B)

A good candidate is “GONAD”:
- G, O, N, A, D  
- O is in position 2 (✓)  
- A is in position 4 (allowed)  
- All other letters are from the allowed set  
- No disallowed letters (R, S, E, C, H, I, B) are used.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good starting word should have frequently used consonants and vowels. Common choices include words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AUDIO"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"". 

After considering these options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps test vowel positions
2. It has common consonants (R, S)
3. It's a valid English word
4. It can help identify which vowels are present and their positions

This should give us good initial information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(x): R is not in the word at all
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3
- S(x): S is not in the word
- E(x): E is not in the word

Key deductions:
1. Letters to avoid: R, S, E
2. Letters we know are in the word: A and O
3. A cannot be in position 1, O cannot be in position 3

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and O
- Does NOT contain R, S, E
- Uses A not in position 1 and O not in position 3

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y
Possible vowels left: A, I, U (O is already known to be present)

Let's try a word that places A in a different position and O in a different position. A good candidate is ""COULD"":
- C, O, U, L, D
- Contains O (not in position 3) and A is not present, so we need another word.

Next candidate: ""PAINT"" - but E is not in the word, but P, A, I, N, T - A is in position 2, O is not in the word.

Next candidate: ""PLAID"" - P, L, A, I, D - A is in position 3, but O is not in the word.

Next candidate: ""MOUNT"" - M, O, U, N, T - O is in position 2 (not 3), A is not in the word.

Next candidate: ""PAINT"" - already checked.

Next candidate: ""ABOUT"" - A is in position 1 (forbidden), O is in position 2 (allowed), but A is in position 1 (forbidden).

Next candidate: ""COBIA"" - C, O, B, I, A - A is in position 5 (allowed), O is in position 2 (allowed), no R/S/E.

This seems valid: COBIA

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback from Guess 2 (""cohiba"") was that the model answer is not five letters, so ""cohiba"" is invalid (it's six letters). I need to choose a valid five-letter word.

From Guess 1 (arose → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)):
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: A (not in position 1) and O (not in position 3)

So the secret word must contain both A and O, must not contain R, S, or E, and must place A somewhere other than position 1 and O somewhere other than position 3.

Possible consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y
Possible vowels left: A, I, U (O is already required)

Let's try to form words that fit these constraints. A good candidate is ""PAINT"":
- P, A, I, N, T
- Contains A (position 2, allowed) and O is missing → but we know O must be present, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""ABOUT"":
- A is in position 1 (forbidden), so invalid.

Next: ""COBIA"":
- C, O, B, I, A
- O is in position 2 (allowed), A is in position 5 (allowed)
- No R, S, or E
- Valid five-letter word

This seems to fit all constraints.

- Position 3: N is in the word and in the correct position (✓)
- Position 4: A is in the word and in the correct position (✓)
- Position 5: D is NOT in the word (x)

So the word pattern is now: _ O N A _

Letters already ruled out: R, S, E, C, H, I, B, G, D

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): A, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has the form _ O N A _
2. Uses only letters from the allowed set
3. Does not use any of the ruled-out letters

Possible first letters: F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s think of words that fit _ON_A_:

- FONAS? (not a word)
- JONAS? (not a word)
- KONAS? (not a word)
- LONAS? (not a word)
- MONAS? (not a word)
- PONAS? (not a word)
- TONAS? (not a word)
- VONAS? (not a word)
- YONAS? (not a word)

Wait, let me think differently: the pattern is _ O N A _, so the word must be of the form [letter] O N A [letter].

Looking at English words that fit this pattern:
- CONAN? (but C is ruled out)
- FONAN? (not a word)
- JONAN? (not a word)
- LONAN? (not a word)
- MONAN? (not a word)
- PONAN? (not a word)
- TONAN? (not a word)
- VONAN? (not a word)
- YONAN? (not a word)

Hmm, seems like there aren't many common words. Let me check if I missed any letters.

Wait, the word must be _ O N A _ and the letters allowed are: A, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking at this, the only common word that fits is ""CONAN"" but C is ruled out.

Wait, let me re-examine the allowed letters. The ruled-out letters are: R, S, E, C, H, I, B, G, D.

So the allowed letters are: A, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The pattern is _ O N A _. The first and last letters must be from the allowed set.

Possible combinations:
- F O N A ? (but we need a 5-letter word, so FONAS? Not a word)
- J O N A ? (JONAS? Not a word)
- K O N A ? (KONAS? Not a word)
- L O N A ? (LONAS? Not a word)
- M O N A ? (MONAS? Not a word)
- P O N A ? (PONAS? Not a word)
- T O N A ? (TONAS? Not a word)
- V O N A ? (VONAS? Not a word)
- W O N A ? (WONAS? Not a word)
- Y O N A ? (YONAS? Not a word)

This is perplexing. Let me check if I made an error in interpreting the feedback.

From Guess 5 (GONAD → G(x) O(✓) N(✓) A(✓) D(x)):

- Position 1: G is NOT in the word (x)
- Position 2: O is in the word and in the correct position (✓)
- Position 3: N is in the word and in the correct position (✓)
- Position 4: A is in the word and in the correct position (✓)
- Position 5: D is NOT in the word (x)

So the word is _ O N A _.

Looking up 5-letter words ending in ANA: 

- CONAN (but C is ruled out)
- FONAN (not a word)
- JONAN (not a word)
- LONAN (not a word)
- MONAN (not a word)
- PONAN (not a word)
- TONAN (not a word)
- VONAN (not a word)
- YONAN (not a word)

Wait, ""TONAL"" doesn't fit the pattern. 

Let me think of words that are _ O N A _:

- FONAS? Not a word.
- JONAS? Not a word.
- LONAS? Not a word.
- MONAS? Not a word.
- PONAS? Not a word.
- TONAS? Not a word.

This is unusual. Let me check if ""TONAL"" is possible, but it doesn't fit _ON_A_.

Wait, the pattern is _ O N A _, so the word must be [letter] O N A [letter].

Looking at this, the only common word that comes to mind is ""CONAN"" but C is ruled out.

Let me check if ""JONAS"" is a valid word: Yes, JONAS is a valid name, but it's proper noun.

Similarly, ""LONAS"" is not a word.

""MONAS"" is plural of monad, but that's obscure.

""FONAS"" is not a word.

""PONAS"" is not a word.

""TONAS"" is not a word.

""YONAS"" is not a word.

""VONAN"" is not a word.

""KONAS"" is not a word.

""Q"" is not useful.

""WONAS"" is not a word.

""X"" is not useful.

""Z"" is not useful.

This suggests that the only possible word is ""CONAN"" but C is ruled out.

This seems like an inconsistency. Let me re-examine the feedback.

From Guess 1 (arose → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)):
- A is in the word but not in position 1
- O is in the word but not in position 3
- R, S, E are not in the word

From Guess 4 (cohib → C(x) O(✓) H(x) I(x) B(x)):
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- C, H, I, B are not in the word

From Guess 5 (gonad → G(x) O(✓) N(✓) A(✓) D(x)):
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- N is in position 3 (✓)
- A is in position 4 (✓)
- G, D are not in the word

So the word is _ O N A _ with no C, H, I, B, G, D, R, S, E.

Allowed letters: A, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for _ O N A _ words:

- FONAS? Not a word.
- JONAS? Not a word.
- LONAS? Not a word.
- MONAS? Not a word.
- PONAS? Not a word.
- TONAS? Not a word.
- VONAS? Not a word.
- YONAS? Not a word.

This is very restrictive. Let me consider that ""TONAL"" doesn't fit, but ""TONAL"" is T O N A L.

Yes! ""TONAL"" is T O N A L. Let me check if it fits:

- T is allowed (not ruled out)
- O is in position 2 (matches ✓)
- N is in position 3 (matches ✓)
- A is in position 4 (matches ✓)
- L is allowed (not ruled out)

Letters used: T, O, N, A, L
Ruled-out letters avoided: R, S, E, C, H, I, B, G, D
This fits perfectly.

So the word must be TONAL.
</think>

From all feedback, the word pattern is _ O N A _ and the only valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern with allowed letters is TONAL.

<guess>tonal</guess>",tonal,"From Guess 5 (GONAD → G(x) O(✓) N(✓) A(✓) D(x)) we now know:

- Position 1: G is NOT in the word (x)
- Position 2: O is in the word and in the correct position (✓)
- Position 3: N is in the word and in the correct position (✓)
- Position 4: A is in the word and in the correct position (✓)
- Position 5: D is NOT in the word (x)

So the word pattern is now: _ O N A _

Letters already ruled out: R, S, E, C, H, I, B, G, D

Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): A, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has the form _ O N A _
2. Uses only letters from the allowed set
3. Does not use any of the ruled-out letters

Possible first letters: F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s think of words that fit _ON_A_:

- FONAS? (not a word)
- JONAS? (not a word)
- KONAS? (not a word)
- LONAS? (not a word)
- MONAS? (not a word)
- PONAS? (not a word)
- TONAS? (not a word)
- VONAS? (not a word)
- YONAS? (not a word)

Wait, let me think differently: the pattern is _ O N A _, so the word must be of the form [letter] O N A [letter].

Looking at English words that fit this pattern:
- CONAN? (but C is ruled out)
- FONAN? (not a word)
- JONAN? (not a word)
- LONAN? (not a word)
- MONAN? (not a word)
- PONAN? (not a word)
- TONAN? (not a word)
- VONAN? (not a word)
- YONAN? (not a word)

Hmm, seems like there aren't many common words. Let me check if I missed any letters.

Wait, the word must be _ O N A _ and the letters allowed are: A, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking at this, the only common word that fits is ""CONAN"" but C is ruled out.

Wait, let me re-examine the allowed letters. The ruled-out letters are: R, S, E, C, H, I, B, G, D.

So the allowed letters are: A, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The pattern is _ O N A _. The first and last letters must be from the allowed set.

Possible combinations:
- F O N A ? (but we need a 5-letter word, so FONAS? Not a word)
- J O N A ? (JONAS? Not a word)
- K O N A ? (KONAS? Not a word)
- L O N A ? (LONAS? Not a word)
- M O N A ? (MONAS? Not a word)
- P O N A ? (PONAS? Not a word)
- T O N A ? (TONAS? Not a word)
- V O N A ? (VONAS? Not a word)
- W O N A ? (WONAS? Not a word)
- Y O N A ? (YONAS? Not a word)

This is perplexing. Let me check if I made an error in interpreting the feedback.

From Guess 5 (GONAD → G(x) O(✓) N(✓) A(✓) D(x)):

- Position 1: G is NOT in the word (x)
- Position 2: O is in the word and in the correct position (✓)
- Position 3: N is in the word and in the correct position (✓)
- Position 4: A is in the word and in the correct position (✓)
- Position 5: D is NOT in the word (x)

So the word is _ O N A _.

Looking up 5-letter words ending in ANA: 

- CONAN (but C is ruled out)
- FONAN (not a word)
- JONAN (not a word)
- LONAN (not a word)
- MONAN (not a word)
- PONAN (not a word)
- TONAN (not a word)
- VONAN (not a word)
- YONAN (not a word)

Wait, ""TONAL"" doesn't fit the pattern. 

Let me think of words that are _ O N A _:

- FONAS? Not a word.
- JONAS? Not a word.
- LONAS? Not a word.
- MONAS? Not a word.
- PONAS? Not a word.
- TONAS? Not a word.

This is unusual. Let me check if ""TONAL"" is possible, but it doesn't fit _ON_A_.

Wait, the pattern is _ O N A _, so the word must be [letter] O N A [letter].

Looking at this, the only common word that comes to mind is ""CONAN"" but C is ruled out.

Let me check if ""JONAS"" is a valid word: Yes, JONAS is a valid name, but it's proper noun.

Similarly, ""LONAS"" is not a word.

""MONAS"" is plural of monad, but that's obscure.

""FONAS"" is not a word.

""PONAS"" is not a word.

""TONAS"" is not a word.

""YONAS"" is not a word.

""VONAN"" is not a word.

""KONAS"" is not a word.

""Q"" is not useful.

""WONAS"" is not a word.

""X"" is not useful.

""Z"" is not useful.

This suggests that the only possible word is ""CONAN"" but C is ruled out.

This seems like an inconsistency. Let me re-examine the feedback.

From Guess 1 (arose → A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)):
- A is in the word but not in position 1
- O is in the word but not in position 3
- R, S, E are not in the word

From Guess 4 (cohib → C(x) O(✓) H(x) I(x) B(x)):
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- C, H, I, B are not in the word

From Guess 5 (gonad → G(x) O(✓) N(✓) A(✓) D(x)):
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- N is in position 3 (✓)
- A is in position 4 (✓)
- G, D are not in the word

So the word is _ O N A _ with no C, H, I, B, G, D, R, S, E.

Allowed letters: A, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for _ O N A _ words:

- FONAS? Not a word.
- JONAS? Not a word.
- LONAS? Not a word.
- MONAS? Not a word.
- PONAS? Not a word.
- TONAS? Not a word.
- VONAS? Not a word.
- YONAS? Not a word.

This is very restrictive. Let me consider that ""TONAL"" doesn't fit, but ""TONAL"" is T O N A L.

Yes! ""TONAL"" is T O N A L. Let me check if it fits:

- T is allowed (not ruled out)
- O is in position 2 (matches ✓)
- N is in position 3 (matches ✓)
- A is in position 4 (matches ✓)
- L is allowed (not ruled out)

Letters used: T, O, N, A, L
Ruled-out letters avoided: R, S, E, C, H, I, B, G, D
This fits perfectly.

So the word must be TONAL.From all feedback, the word pattern is _ O N A _ and the only valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern with allowed letters is TONAL.",Guess 6: tonal -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) N(✓) A(✓) L(✓),FAIL
