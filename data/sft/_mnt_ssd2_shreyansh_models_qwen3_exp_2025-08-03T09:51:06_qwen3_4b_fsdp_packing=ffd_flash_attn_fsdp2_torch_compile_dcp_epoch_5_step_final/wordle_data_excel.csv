From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but in the wrong position (it appears at the end in arose, so it must be somewhere else).

So we now know:
- The word contains the letter E.
- It does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.
- E is not in the 5th position.

To maximize information on the next guess, we want a word that:
1. Uses E in a different position (not 5th).
2. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet (like T, L, N, I, C, etc.).
3. Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.

A good candidate is “intel”:
- It places E in the 4th position (not 5th).
- It introduces T, N, L, which are common and untested.
- It avoids all ruled-out letters (A, R, O, S).

However, “intel” has only 4 letters. We need a 5-letter word. Another option is “tenet”:
- T, N, E (with E in 3rd position), T again.

But “tenet” repeats T, which might not be optimal. Instead, let’s choose “intel” with a 5-letter variant: “intel” is 5 letters. Wait, no, “intel” is 5 letters (I-N-T-E-L). That’s perfect:
- I (new letter)
- N (new letter)
- T (new letter)
- E (known letter, now in 4th position)
- L (new letter)

This gives us 5 new letters except for E, and positions E elsewhere.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should have a mix of these letters to quickly identify which ones are in the word and their positions.

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us a good spread of common letters and vowels to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but in the wrong position (it appears at the end in arose, so it must be somewhere else).

So we now know:
- The word contains the letter E.
- It does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.
- E is not in the 5th position.

To maximize information on the next guess, we want a word that:
1. Uses E in a different position (not 5th).
2. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet (like T, L, N, I, C, etc.).
3. Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.

A good candidate is “intel”:
- It places E in the 4th position (not 5th).
- It introduces T, N, L, which are common and untested.
- It avoids all ruled-out letters (A, R, O, S).

However, “intel” has only 4 letters. We need a 5-letter word. Another option is “tenet”:
- T, N, E (with E in 3rd position), T again.

But “tenet” repeats T, which might not be optimal. Instead, let’s choose “intel” with a 5-letter variant: “intel” is 5 letters. Wait, no, “intel” is 5 letters (I-N-T-E-L). That’s perfect:
- I (new letter)
- N (new letter)
- T (new letter)
- E (known letter, now in 4th position)
- L (new letter)

This gives us 5 new letters except for E, and positions E elsewhere.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should have a mix of these letters to quickly identify which ones are in the word and their positions.

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives us a good spread of common letters and vowels to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but in the wrong position (it appears at the end in arose, so it must be somewhere else).

So we now know:
- The word contains the letter E.
- It does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.
- E is not in the 5th position.

To maximize information on the next guess, we want a word that:
1. Uses E in a different position (not 5th).
2. Introduces new common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet (like T, L, N, I, C, etc.).
3. Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.

A good candidate is “intel”:
- It places E in the 4th position (not 5th).
- It introduces T, N, L, which are common and untested.
- It avoids all ruled-out letters (A, R, O, S).

However, “intel” has only 4 letters. We need a 5-letter word. Another option is “tenet”:
- T, N, E (with E in 3rd position), T again.

But “tenet” repeats T, which might not be optimal. Instead, let’s choose “intel” with a 5-letter variant: “intel” is 5 letters. Wait, no, “intel” is 5 letters (I-N-T-E-L). That’s perfect:
- I (new letter)
- N (new letter)
- T (new letter)
- E (known letter, now in 4th position)
- L (new letter)

This gives us 5 new letters except for E, and positions E elsewhere.

Let’s break down the new feedback on BELCH:

- B(x) → B is NOT in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position.  
  (Previously we knew E is in the word and is in the 4th position, so this confirms E is at 4th.)
- L(-) → L is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position.  
  (Previously we knew L is in the word and is in the 5th position, so this confirms L is at 5th.)
- C(-) → C is in the word but NOT in the 4th position.  
  (We know the 4th position is E, so this just tells us C is somewhere else.)
- H(x) → H is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ E L
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, S, I, N, T, B, H
- Letters still allowed: C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E, L are already placed)

We need a 5-letter word ending in “EL” that uses only the allowed letters and fits the pattern _ _ _ E L.

Common words ending in “EL” with C allowed:
- CELLO (but O is ruled out)
- CLEF (but F is allowed, and we have C, L, E, F)
- CLEFT (but T is ruled out)
- CLOUD (but O, U, D are allowed, but ends in D, not EL)
- FLECK (but K is allowed, ends in K, not EL)
- GLEAM (but A, M are allowed, ends in M)

- PELIC (not valid)
- VELAR (A ruled out)

- GELID (but has I)  
- CLEF (4 letters)

Check letters:  
V – allowed  
E – allowed (fixed 4th)

The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should have a mix of these letters to quickly identify which ones are in the word and their positions.\n\nOne such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:\n- A (very common vowel)\n- R (common consonant)\n- O (common vowel)\n- S (common consonant)\n- E (most common letter overall)\n\nThis combination gives us a good spread of common letters and vowels to start narrowing down possibilities.\n\n<guess>arose</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on ""arose"":\n- A(x) → A is not in the word.\n- R(x) → R is not in the word.\n- O(x) → O is not in the word.\n- S(x) → S is not in the word.\n- E(-) → E is in the word but in the wrong position (it appears at the end in arose, so it must be somewhere else).\n\nSo we now know:\n- The word contains the letter E.\n- It does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.\n- E is not in the 5th position.\n\nTo maximize information on the next guess, we want a word that:\n1.

Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.\n\nA good candidate is “intel”:\n- It places E in the 4th position (not 5th).\n- It introduces T, N, L, which are common and untested.\n- It avoids all ruled-out letters (A, R, O, S).\n\nHowever, “intel” has only 4 letters. We need a 5-letter word. Another option is “tenet”:\n- T, N, E (with E in 3rd position), T again.\n\nBut “tenet” repeats T, which might not be optimal.

From the new feedback on VEXEL:
- V(x) → V is NOT in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (already known to be in 4th).
- X(-) → X is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct 4th position.
- L(✓) → L is in the word and in the correct 5th position.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ E L
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, S, I, N, T, B, H, V
- Letters still allowed: C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, U, W, Y, Z (and X is in the word but not in 3rd position)

We need a 5-letter word ending in “EL” that contains X and uses only the allowed letters. The only possible positions for X are 1st or 2nd (since 3rd is excluded).

Possible words:
- X _ _ E L: Need a valid word starting with X. Possible: XENEL (invalid), XENON (ends in N), XEROX (ends in X), XYLEM (ends in M), XYLEN (ends in N). None seem valid.
- _ X _ E L: Need a valid word with X in 2nd position. Possible: C X _ E L – but C is allowed, but “CXEL_” isn’t a word. D X _ E L – “DXEL_” isn’t a word. F X _ E L – “FXEL_” isn’t a word. G X _ E L – “GXEL_” isn’t a word. J X _ E L – “JXEL_” isn’t a word. K X _ E L – “KXEL_” isn’t a word. M X _ E L – “MXEL_” isn’t a word. P X _ E L – “PXEL_” isn’t a word. Q X _ E L – “QXEL_” isn’t a word. U X _ E L – “UXEL_” isn’t a word. W X _ E L – “WXEL_” isn’t a word. Y X _ E L – “YXEL_” isn’t a word. Z X _ E L – “ZXEL_” isn’t a word.

This suggests there might be no valid 5-letter words ending in “EL” with X in 2nd position. Let me double-check possible words:

- “JELLY” – ends in Y
- “MELON” – ends in N
- “CELLO” – ends in O
- “CLEF” – 4 letters
- “FLECK” – ends in K
- “GELID” – ends in D
- “PULPY” – ends in Y
- “QUILT” – ends in T
- “WELDY” – not valid
- “XENEL” – not valid
- “YELPS” – ends in S
- “ZELDA” – ends in A

It appears the only remaining possibility is “XENEL” (a variant spelling of “xylene”), but it’s not widely accepted. Another possibility is “XENEL” itself, which is a valid chemical term.

Let’s try “XENEL”.
