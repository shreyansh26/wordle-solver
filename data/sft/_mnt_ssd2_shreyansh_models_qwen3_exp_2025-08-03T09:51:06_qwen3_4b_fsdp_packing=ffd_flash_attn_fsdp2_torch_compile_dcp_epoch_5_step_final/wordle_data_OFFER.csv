### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The most common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U, and common consonants include R, T, N, S, L, etc. A good starting word should ideally contain 2-3 vowels and 3-4 consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word.

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers common letters and provides good vowel coverage.

So far we know:

Because E appeared in position 5 in SLATE and in position 4 in CRONE, and always got “-” (wrong position), E cannot be in position 4 or 5.  
Therefore E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

R appeared in position 2 in CRONE and got “-”, so R is not in position 2.  
O appeared in position 3 in CRONE and got “-”, so O is not in position 3.

We still need to place R, O, and E into the word, and we have no other letters pinned down yet.  
A good next guess should:
1. Place E in a new position (1, 2, or 3).
2. Try R in a new position (not 2).
3. Try O in a new position (not 3).
4. Introduce new letters that are common and haven’t been tested yet.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The most common vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U, and common consonants include R, T, N, S, L, etc. A good starting word should ideally contain 2-3 vowels and 3-4 consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the word.

Some popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""SLATE"" as it covers common letters and provides good vowel coverage.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: not in the word (x)
- A: not in the word (x)
- T: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So:
- Eliminate S, L, A, T
- E is somewhere in the word, but not in the last position (so E must be in positions 1-4)

Next guess should:
1. Include E (but not at position 5)
2. Avoid S, L, A, T
3. Introduce new common letters to maximize info

Good consonants left: R, N, C, D, P, M, etc.
Good vowels left: I, O, U (since A is out)

A strong candidate is ""CRONE"":
- C: new consonant
- R: common consonant
- O: new vowel
- N: common consonant
- E: known to be in word, placed at position 4 (since it can't be at 5)

This tests 5 new letters while ensuring E is in a new position.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, N
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are unknown: R, O, E

Because E appeared in position 5 in SLATE and in position 4 in CRONE, and always got “-” (wrong position), E cannot be in position 4 or 5.  
Therefore E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

R appeared in position 2 in CRONE and got “-”, so R is not in position 2.  
O appeared in position 3 in CRONE and got “-”, so O is not in position 3.

We still need to place R, O, and E into the word, and we have no other letters pinned down yet.  
A good next guess should:
1. Place E in a new position (1, 2, or 3).
2. Try R in a new position (not 2).
3. Try O in a new position (not 3).
4. Introduce new letters that are common and haven’t been tested yet.

Common remaining consonants: D, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Vowels left: I, U (A and E and O are already accounted for).

Let’s try “PERIOD”:
- P: new
- E: place it in position 1 (since it can’t be 4 or 5)
- R: place it in position 3 (since it can’t be 2)
- I: new vowel
- O: place it in position 2 (since it can’t be 3)
- D: new consonant

This tests new letters while respecting the positional constraints we have.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K  
Letters that ARE in the word (but position unknown): R, O, E

So the secret word must contain exactly the letters R, O, E and two other letters chosen only from the still-allowed set:  
{D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y, …} (common ones first)

Constraints on R, O, E:
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from CRONE and BROKE feedback)
- R cannot be in position 2 (from CRONE feedback)
- O cannot be in position 3 (from CRONE feedback)

We need a 5-letter word that uses R, O, E plus two new allowed letters, and respects the positional bans above.

Candidate pool with R, O, E and two new letters:
- D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y

A good choice is “GROVE”:
- G: new letter
- R: allowed, position 2 is banned but here R is in position 1 (OK)

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, N
- Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are unknown: R, O, E

Because E appeared in position 5 in SLATE and in position 4 in CRONE, and always got “-” (wrong position), E cannot be in position 4 or 5.  
Therefore E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

R appeared in position 2 in CRONE and got “-”, so R is not in position 2.  
O appeared in position 3 in CRONE and got “-”, so O is not in position 3.

We still need to place R, O, and E into the word, and we have no other letters pinned down yet.  
A good next guess should:
1. Place E in a new position (1, 2, or 3).
2. Try R in a new position (not 2).
3. Try O in a new position (not 3).
4. Introduce new letters that are common and haven’t been tested yet.

Common remaining consonants: D, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Vowels left: I, U (A and E and O are already accounted for).

Let’s try “PERIOD”:

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: CRONE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) O(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 3: PERIOD -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 4: BROKE -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(-) O(-) K(x) E(-)

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, N, B, K  
Letters that ARE in the word (but position unknown): R, O, E

So the secret word must contain exactly the letters R, O, E and two other letters chosen only from the still-allowed set:  
{D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y, …} (common ones first)

Constraints on R, O, E:
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from CRONE and BROKE feedback)
- R cannot be in position 2 (from CRONE feedback)
- O cannot be in position 3 (from CRONE feedback)

We need a 5-letter word that uses R, O, E plus two new allowed letters, and respects the positional bans above.

Candidate pool with R, O, E and two new letters:
- D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y

A good choice is “GROVE”:
- G: new letter
- R: allowed, position 2 is banned but here R is in position 1 (OK)
- O: allowed, position 3 is banned but here O is in position 2 (OK)
- V: new letter
- E: allowed, position 5 is banned but here E is in position 4 (OK)

This satisfies every constraint.
