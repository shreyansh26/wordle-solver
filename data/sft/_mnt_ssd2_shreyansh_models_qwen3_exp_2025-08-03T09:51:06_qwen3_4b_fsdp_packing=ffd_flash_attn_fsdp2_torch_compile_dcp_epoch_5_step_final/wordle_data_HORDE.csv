### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give good coverage of common letters and help narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.

So far we know:
- The word ends with E (position 5).
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, N.
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: R and O.

Therefore:
- Position 5 = E
- R and O must appear somewhere in positions 1-4
- Remaining letters to avoid: S, L, A, T, C, N
- We still need to test other common letters like D, H, M, P, etc.

A good next word should:
1. Keep E in position 5
2. Place R and O in new positions
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested

A candidate word: ""DROVE""
- D, R, O, V, E
- Keeps E in position 5
- Moves R to position 2 and O to position 3
- Tests new letters D and V
- Avoids all excluded letters (S, L, A, T, C, N)

Let's try to arrange R, O, D plus one more letter (not excluded) in positions 1-4.

Common remaining letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, W, Y.

Try ""BRODE"":
- B, R, O, D, E
- Contains R, O, D and ends with E
- All letters are allowed (none are excluded)
- This uses all required letters in new positions.

But ""BRODE"" isn't a valid English word. Next option: ""DORIE"":
- D, O, R, I, E
- Contains D, O, R and ends with E
- I is allowed
- This is a valid word.

Let's check:
- D, O, R are in the word (from feedback)
- I is a new letter
- Ends with E
- No excluded letters

""DORIE"" seems valid.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give good coverage of common letters and help narrow down the possibilities for the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- E is in the word and is in the 5th position (✓).
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).

So the secret word ends with E and does NOT contain S, L, A, T.

I now need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T

Good letters to try next: common consonants like R, N, C, D, H, M, P, etc., and the remaining vowels I, O, U.

A balanced choice is ""CRONE"":
- C, R, O, N, E
- Ends with E
- Does not contain S, L, A, T
- Uses common letters and covers new possibilities

So far we know:
- The word ends with E (position 5).
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, N.
- Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: R and O.

Therefore:
- Position 5 = E
- R and O must appear somewhere in positions 1-4
- Remaining letters to avoid: S, L, A, T, C, N
- We still need to test other common letters like D, H, M, P, etc.

A good next word should:
1. Keep E in position 5
2. Place R and O in new positions
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tested

A candidate word: ""DROVE""
- D, R, O, V, E
- Keeps E in position 5
- Moves R to position 2 and O to position 3
- Tests new letters D and V
- Avoids all excluded letters (S, L, A, T, C, N)

This seems like a strong next guess.

From all the feedback so far:

1. Position 5 = E (confirmed in every guess)
2. Letters that ARE in the word and are in the correct positions:
   - O in position 2
   - R in position 3
   - E in position 5
3. Letters that ARE in the word but are in the wrong positions:
   - D (appeared in guesses 3 and 4 but never in positions 1 or 4)
4. Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, N, V, I

So the pattern is: _ O R _ E

We know:
- D must appear somewhere in positions 1 or 4 (since it was marked ""-"" in both positions 1 and 4 in previous guesses, meaning it's in the word but not in those positions yet).
- The remaining letters to use are from the unused pool: B, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W, Y, etc.

Let's try to place D in position 1: D O R _ E
We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with DOR and ends with E. The only common word fitting this pattern is ""DORIE"", but we already tried it and I was marked as wrong (x). Since I is excluded, we need another letter for position 4.

Possible letters for position 4 (not excluded): B, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W, Y
Let's try ""DORBE"" - but this isn't a valid word.
""DORGE"" - not valid.
""DORKE"" - not valid.
""DORHE"" - not valid.
""DORME"" - not valid.
""DORPE"" - not valid.
""DORUE"" - not valid.
""DORWE"" - not valid.
""DORYE"" - not valid.

None of these seem to work. Let's try placing D in position 4: _ O R D E
We need a valid word ending in ORDE. The only common word ending in ORDE is ""BORDE"" (but this is a proper noun, not a common word), ""FORDE"", ""GORD E"" (but GORDE isn't a word), ""HORDE"" - this is a valid English word.

""HORDE"" fits:
- Pattern: _ O R D E
- Contains O in position 2, R in position 3, D in position 4, E in position 5
- Uses H in position 1 (new letter)
- No excluded letters
- Valid English word

This seems to be the best next guess.
