For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these letters while being a valid 5-letter word.

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid English word. This should give us good coverage of common letters to work with in subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and E.
- Does NOT contain R, O, or S.
- A is not in position 1.
- E is not in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that includes both A and E, excludes R, O, S, and satisfies the position constraints.  
Good candidate letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A strong next guess would be “TENET”:
- It has two E’s and one A (but we only need one A and one E).  
- It uses common letters T, E, N.  
- It places A in position 2 and E in positions 3 and 5, satisfying the constraints (A not in position 1, E not in position 5).

However, “TENET” repeats letters and might not be optimal. A better choice is “ELATE”:
- Uses E, L, A, T, E.  
- A is in position 2 (not 1).  
- E is in positions 1, 4, 5 (not 5 specifically, so this satisfies the constraint).  
- No R, O, or S.

But “ELATE” repeats E. A single E is sufficient.  
Another good option is “PLAID”:
- P, L, A, I, D.  
- A in position 3 (not 1).  
- E is missing, but we know E must be present somewhere. So this is bad.

Wait, we must include E somewhere.  
A better choice is “ECLAT”:
- E, C, L, A, T.  
- A in position 4 (not 1).  
- E in position 1 (not 5).  
- Excludes R, O, S.  
- Uses new letters C, L, T.

This seems optimal.

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - R, O, S are not in the word.

   - E is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L is in the word but not in position 3.
   - A is in the word but not in position 4.
   - C and T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters that must appear: A, E, L
- Letters that must NOT appear: R, O, S, C, T
- Position constraints:
  - A ≠ 1 and A ≠ 4
  - E ≠ 1 and E ≠ 5
  - L ≠ 3

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, E, L exactly once each (or possibly more if allowed), avoids the forbidden letters, and respects the positional bans.

Let’s list possible positions for each required letter:
- A can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- E can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- L can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

We also need two more distinct letters from the remaining allowed set: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- Place A in position 2 (middle).
- Place E in position 4 (fourth).
- Place L in position 1 (first).
- Need two more letters for positions 3 and 5. Allowed letters: any except the forbidden ones and the used letters A, E, L.

A good candidate is “BLEND”:
- B, L, E, N, D.
- A and E are both present, but we missed A in this word. So this is invalid.

We must include A. Let’s try “LEANT”:
- L, E, A, N, T. But T is forbidden.

Next, “LENA_” – but we need five letters. Try “LENA_” with a valid letter: “LENAR” – invalid.

Try “LALED” – repeats L and A, which may not help.

Better approach: systematically check positions.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: L (allowed)
- Position 2: A (allowed, not banned)
- Position 3: must be allowed letter, not L or A
- Position 4: E (allowed)
- Position 5: must be allowed letter, not E

So far: L A _ E _

Allowed letters for positions 3 and 5: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Pick common ones: N and D → “L A N E D” → “LANED” – valid word.

Check constraints:
- Contains A, E, L – yes.
- Does not contain R, O, S, C, T – yes.
- A is in position 2 (not 1 or 4) – good.
- E is in position 4 (not 1 or 5) – good.
- L is in position 1 (not 3) – good.

“LANED” seems valid.

But “LANED” is less common. Another option: “LADED” – invalid.

Try “LADED” – no. “LADED” not a word.

Next: “LAVER” – R is forbidden.

“LAUGH” – G, H allowed. Contains A, L, U, G, H. But missing E – invalid.

We must include E. So back to systematic:

Positions:
1: L
2: A
3: ?
4: E
5: ?

Need two more letters. Let’s pick N and D → “LANED”.

Another option: “L A P E D” → “LAPED” – valid.

Check:
- L A P E D
- Contains A, E, L – yes.
- No forbidden letters – yes.
- Position constraints:
  - A is 2 (ok)
  - E is 4 (ok)
  - L is 1 (ok)

“LAPED” is a valid English word (past tense of “lap”).

This seems optimal.

Next: “LAVER” – R is forbidden.

“LAUGH” – G, H allowed. Contains A, L, U, G, H. But missing E – invalid.

We must include E. So back to systematic:

Positions:
1: L
2: A
3: ?
4: E
5: ?

Need two more letters. Let’s pick N and D → “LANED”.

Another option: “L A P E D” → “LAPED” – valid.

Check:
- L A P E D
- Contains A, E, L – yes.
- No forbidden letters – yes.
- Position constraints:
  - A is 2 (ok)
  - E is 4 (ok)
  - L is 1 (ok)

“LAPED” is a valid English word (past tense of “lap”).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these letters while being a valid 5-letter word.

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid English word. This should give us good coverage of common letters to work with in subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and E.
- Does NOT contain R, O, or S.
- A is not in position 1.
- E is not in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that includes both A and E, excludes R, O, S, and satisfies the position constraints.  
Good candidate letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A strong next guess would be “TENET”:
- It has two E’s and one A (but we only need one A and one E).  
- It uses common letters T, E, N.  
- It places A in position 2 and E in positions 3 and 5, satisfying the constraints (A not in position 1, E not in position 5).

However, “TENET” repeats letters and might not be optimal. A better choice is “ELATE”:
- Uses E, L, A, T, E.  
- A is in position 2 (not 1).  
- E is in positions 1, 4, 5 (not 5 specifically, so this satisfies the constraint).  
- No R, O, or S.

But “ELATE” repeats E. A single E is sufficient.  
Another good option is “PLAID”:
- P, L, A, I, D.  
- A in position 3 (not 1).  
- E is missing, but we know E must be present somewhere. So this is bad.

Wait, we must include E somewhere.  
A better choice is “ECLAT”:
- E, C, L, A, T.  
- A in position 4 (not 1).  
- E in position 1 (not 5).  
- Excludes R, O, S.  
- Uses new letters C, L, T.

This seems optimal.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: eclat -> FEEDBACK: E(-) C(x) L(-) A(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - R, O, S are not in the word.

2. eclat → E(-) C(x) L(-) A(-) T(x)
   - E is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L is in the word but not in position 3.
   - A is in the word but not in position 4.
   - C and T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters that must appear: A, E, L
- Letters that must NOT appear: R, O, S, C, T
- Position constraints:
  - A ≠ 1 and A ≠ 4
  - E ≠ 1 and E ≠ 5
  - L ≠ 3

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, E, L exactly once each (or possibly more if allowed), avoids the forbidden letters, and respects the positional bans.

Let’s list possible positions for each required letter:
- A can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- E can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- L can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

We also need two more distinct letters from the remaining allowed set: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- Place A in position 2 (middle).
- Place E in position 4 (fourth).
- Place L in position 1 (first).
- Need two more letters for positions 3 and 5. Allowed letters: any except the forbidden ones and the used letters A, E, L.

A good candidate is “BLEND”:
- B, L, E, N, D.
- A and E are both present, but we missed A in this word. So this is invalid.

We must include A. Let’s try “LEANT”:
- L, E, A, N, T. But T is forbidden.

Next, “LENA_” – but we need five letters. Try “LENA_” with a valid letter: “LENAR” – invalid.

Try “LALED” – repeats L and A, which may not help.

Better approach: systematically check positions.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: L (allowed)
- Position 2: A (allowed, not banned)
- Position 3: must be allowed letter, not L or A
- Position 4: E (allowed)
- Position 5: must be allowed letter, not E

So far: L A _ E _

Allowed letters for positions 3 and 5: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Pick common ones: N and D → “L A N E D” → “LANED” – valid word.

Check constraints:
- Contains A, E, L – yes.
- Does not contain R, O, S, C, T – yes.
- A is in position 2 (not 1 or 4) – good.
- E is in position 4 (not 1 or 5) – good.
- L is in position 1 (not 3) – good.

“LANED” seems valid.

But “LANED” is less common. Another option: “LADED” – invalid.

Try “LADED” – no. “LADED” not a word.

Next: “LAVER” – R is forbidden.

“LAUGH” – G, H allowed. Contains A, L, U, G, H. But missing E – invalid.

We must include E. So back to systematic:

Positions:
1: L
2: A
3: ?
4: E
5: ?

Need two more letters. Let’s pick N and D → “LANED”.

Another option: “L A P E D” → “LAPED” – valid.

Check:
- L A P E D
- Contains A, E, L – yes.
- No forbidden letters – yes.
- Position constraints:
  - A is 2 (ok)
  - E is 4 (ok)
  - L is 1 (ok)

“LAPED” is a valid English word (past tense of “lap”).

This seems optimal.

Let's digest the new feedback for L A P E D:

L(✓) – L is in the word and is in position 1.  
A(-) – A is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
P(x) – P is NOT in the word.  
E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
D(x) – D is NOT in the word.

So far we know:

Letters that must appear: L (locked at position 1), A, E  
Letters that must NOT appear: R, O, S, C, T, P, D  
Position constraints:
- L is fixed at position 1.
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4.  
  → A can only be in positions 3 or 5.
- E cannot be in positions 1, 4, 5.  
  → E can only be in positions 2 or 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with L.
- Contains A and E exactly once each.
- Respects the positional bans.
- Uses only allowed letters (no R, O, S, C, T, P, D).

Remaining allowed letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s list possible placements:

Case 1: A in position 3  
Then E must be in position 2 (only remaining spot).  
Word pattern: L E A _ _

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, chosen from allowed letters and not repeating A, E, L.

Possible letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A common word that fits: L E A N _ → “LEANS” – but S is forbidden.  
Next: L E A N Y → “LEANY” – not a word.  
L E A N G → “LEANG” – not a word.  
L E A N K → “LEANK” – not a word.  
L E A N B → “LEANB” – invalid.

Case 2: A in position 5  
Then E must be in position 2 (only remaining spot).  
Word pattern: L E _ _ A

We need two more letters for positions 3 and 4, chosen from allowed letters and not repeating A, E, L.

Possible letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A valid word: L E G A M – but M is allowed, but “LEGAM” is not a word.  
L E G A N – “LEGAN” – not a word.  
L E G A M – invalid.  
L E V A N – “LE VAN” – invalid.  
L E V A N – “LEVEN” – no.  
L E N A V – invalid.  
L E N A G – invalid.  
L E N A B – invalid.  
L E N A Y – invalid.

Wait, let’s think of real words.  
L E G A L – but L is already in position 1 and can’t repeat.  
L E G A L – invalid.  
L E G A M – invalid.  
L E G A N – invalid.  
L E G A M – invalid.  
L E G A N – invalid.  
L E G A M – invalid.

Let’s try L E G A N – no.  
L E G A M – no.  
L E G A N – no.

Another approach: list real words starting with L, containing A and E, avoiding forbidden letters.

Possible words:
- L E A N _ – but we saw no valid endings.  
- L E G A L – invalid (double L).  
- L E A V E – but E is in position 5 which is forbidden for E.  
- L E A R N – R is forbidden.  
- L E A V E – E in position 5 forbidden.  
- L E A N E – E in position 5 forbidden.  
- L E A M B – invalid.  
- L E A N G – invalid.  
- L E A N Y – invalid.

- L E A N Q – invalid.  
- L E A N U – invalid.  
- L E A N X – invalid.  
- L E A N Z – invalid.  
- L E A N J – invalid.

Hmm, seems scarce. Let’s try A in position 3, E in position 2:

L E A _ _  
We need two more letters. Let’s try L E A N Y – invalid.  
L E A N G – invalid.  
L E A N B – invalid.

L E A N Q – invalid.  
L E A N U – invalid.  
L E A N X – invalid.  
L E A N Z – invalid.  
L E A N J – invalid.

Wait, “LEANT” – but T is forbidden.  
“LEANS” – S forbidden.  
“LEACH” – C forbidden.  
“LEAFY” – Y is allowed, but is “LEAFY” valid? Yes, it is.  
Check constraints:
- L E A F Y
- Contains L (pos 1 ✓), A (pos 3, allowed), E (pos 2, allowed).  
- No forbidden letters.  
- E is in pos 2 (allowed).  
- A is in pos 3 (allowed).  
- Y is allowed.  
This fits perfectly.

So the next guess is “LEAFY”.

Hmm, seems scarce. Let’s try A in position 3, E in position 2:

L E A _ _  
We need two more letters. Let’s try L E A N Y – invalid.  
L E A N G – invalid.  
L E A N B – invalid.  
L E A N K – invalid.  
L E A N F – invalid.  
L E A N V – invalid.  
L E A N H – invalid.  
L E A N I – invalid.  
L E A N Q – invalid.  
L E A N U – invalid.  
L E A N X – invalid.  
L E A N Z – invalid.  
L E A N J – invalid.

Wait, “LEANT” – but T is forbidden.  
“LEANS” – S forbidden.  
“LEACH” – C forbidden.  
“LEAFY” – Y is allowed, but is “LEAFY” valid? Yes, it is.  
Check constraints:
- L E A F Y
- Contains L (pos 1 ✓), A (pos 3, allowed), E (pos 2, allowed).  
- No forbidden letters.  
- E is in pos 2 (allowed).  
- A is in pos 3 (allowed).

This fits perfectly.

So the next guess is “LEAFY”.",Guess 4: leafy -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) E(✓) A(✓) F(x) Y(✓),FAIL

For the first guess in Wordle, it's optimal to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word that uses several of these letters while being a valid 5-letter word.

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid English word. This should give us good coverage of common letters to work with in subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and E.
- Does NOT contain R, O, or S.
- A is not in position 1.
- E is not in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that includes both A and E, excludes R, O, S, and satisfies the position constraints.  
Good candidate letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A strong next guess would be “TENET”:
- It has two E’s and one A (but we only need one A and one E).  
- It uses common letters T, E, N.  
- It places A in position 2 and E in positions 3 and 5, satisfying the constraints (A not in position 1, E not in position 5).

However, “TENET” repeats letters and might not be optimal. A better choice is “ELATE”:
- Uses E, L, A, T, E.  
- A is in position 2 (not 1).  
- E is in positions 1, 4, 5 (not 5 specifically, so this satisfies the constraint).  
- No R, O, or S.

But “ELATE” repeats E. A single E is sufficient.  
Another good option is “PLAID”:
- P, L, A, I, D.  
- A in position 3 (not 1).  
- E is missing, but we know E must be present somewhere. So this is bad.

Wait, we must include E somewhere.  
A better choice is “ECLAT”:
- E, C, L, A, T.  
- A in position 4 (not 1).  
- E in position 1 (not 5).  
- Excludes R, O, S.  
- Uses new letters C, L, T.

This seems optimal.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: eclat -> FEEDBACK: E(-) C(x) L(-) A(-) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in the word but not in position 5.
   - R, O, S are not in the word.

2. eclat → E(-) C(x) L(-) A(-) T(x)
   - E is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L is in the word but not in position 3.
   - A is in the word but not in position 4.
   - C and T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters that must appear: A, E, L
- Letters that must NOT appear: R, O, S, C, T
- Position constraints:
  - A ≠ 1 and A ≠ 4
  - E ≠ 1 and E ≠ 5
  - L ≠ 3

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, E, L exactly once each (or possibly more if allowed), avoids the forbidden letters, and respects the positional bans.

Let’s list possible positions for each required letter:
- A can be in positions 2, 3, or 5.
- E can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- L can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

We also need two more distinct letters from the remaining allowed set: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- Place A in position 2 (middle).
- Place E in position 4 (fourth).
- Place L in position 1 (first).
- Need two more letters for positions 3 and 5. Allowed letters: any except the forbidden ones and the used letters A, E, L.

A good candidate is “BLEND”:
- B, L, E, N, D.
- A and E are both present, but we missed A in this word. So this is invalid.

We must include A. Let’s try “LEANT”:
- L, E, A, N, T. But T is forbidden.

Next, “LENA_” – but we need five letters. Try “LENA_” with a valid letter: “LENAR” – invalid.

Try “LALED” – repeats L and A, which may not help.

Better approach: systematically check positions.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: L (allowed)
- Position 2: A (allowed, not banned)
- Position 3: must be allowed letter, not L or A
- Position 4: E (allowed)
- Position 5: must be allowed letter, not E

So far: L A _ E _

Allowed letters for positions 3 and 5: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Pick common ones: N and D → “L A N E D” → “LANED” – valid word.

Check constraints:
- Contains A, E, L – yes.
- Does not contain R, O, S, C, T – yes.
- A is in position 2 (not 1 or 4) – good.
- E is in position 4 (not 1 or 5) – good.
- L is in position 1 (not 3) – good.

“LANED” seems valid.

But “LANED” is less common. Another option: “LADED” – invalid.

Try “LADED” – no. “LADED” not a word.

Next: “LAVER” – R is forbidden.

“LAUGH” – G, H allowed. Contains A, L, U, G, H. But missing E – invalid.

We must include E. So back to systematic:

Positions:
1: L
2: A
3: ?
4: E
5: ?

Need two more letters. Let’s pick N and D → “LANED”.

Another option: “L A P E D” → “LAPED” – valid.

Check:
- L A P E D
- Contains A, E, L – yes.
- No forbidden letters – yes.
- Position constraints:
  - A is 2 (ok)
  - E is 4 (ok)
  - L is 1 (ok)

“LAPED” is a valid English word (past tense of “lap”).

This seems optimal.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: laped -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) A(-) P(x) E(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's digest the new feedback for L A P E D:

L(✓) – L is in the word and is in position 1.  
A(-) – A is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
P(x) – P is NOT in the word.  
E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
D(x) – D is NOT in the word.

So far we know:

Letters that must appear: L (locked at position 1), A, E  
Letters that must NOT appear: R, O, S, C, T, P, D  
Position constraints:
- L is fixed at position 1.
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4.  
  → A can only be in positions 3 or 5.
- E cannot be in positions 1, 4, 5.  
  → E can only be in positions 2 or 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with L.
- Contains A and E exactly once each.
- Respects the positional bans.
- Uses only allowed letters (no R, O, S, C, T, P, D).

Remaining allowed letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s list possible placements:

Case 1: A in position 3  
Then E must be in position 2 (only remaining spot).  
Word pattern: L E A _ _

We need two more letters for positions 4 and 5, chosen from allowed letters and not repeating A, E, L.

Possible letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A common word that fits: L E A N _ → “LEANS” – but S is forbidden.  
Next: L E A N Y → “LEANY” – not a word.  
L E A N G → “LEANG” – not a word.  
L E A N K → “LEANK” – not a word.  
L E A N B → “LEANB” – invalid.

Case 2: A in position 5  
Then E must be in position 2 (only remaining spot).  
Word pattern: L E _ _ A

We need two more letters for positions 3 and 4, chosen from allowed letters and not repeating A, E, L.

Possible letters: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A valid word: L E G A M – but M is allowed, but “LEGAM” is not a word.  
L E G A N – “LEGAN” – not a word.  
L E G A M – invalid.  
L E V A N – “LE VAN” – invalid.  
L E V A N – “LEVEN” – no.  
L E N A V – invalid.  
L E N A G – invalid.  
L E N A B – invalid.  
L E N A Y – invalid.

Wait, let’s think of real words.  
L E G A L – but L is already in position 1 and can’t repeat.  
L E G A L – invalid.  
L E G A M – invalid.  
L E G A N – invalid.  
L E G A M – invalid.  
L E G A N – invalid.  
L E G A M – invalid.

Let’s try L E G A N – no.  
L E G A M – no.  
L E G A N – no.

Another approach: list real words starting with L, containing A and E, avoiding forbidden letters.

Possible words:
- L E A N _ – but we saw no valid endings.  
- L E G A L – invalid (double L).  
- L E A V E – but E is in position 5 which is forbidden for E.  
- L E A R N – R is forbidden.  
- L E A V E – E in position 5 forbidden.  
- L E A N E – E in position 5 forbidden.  
- L E A M B – invalid.  
- L E A N G – invalid.  
- L E A N Y – invalid.  
- L E A N B – invalid.  
- L E A N K – invalid.  
- L E A N F – invalid.  
- L E A N V – invalid.  
- L E A N H – invalid.  
- L E A N I – invalid.  
- L E A N Q – invalid.  
- L E A N U – invalid.  
- L E A N X – invalid.  
- L E A N Z – invalid.  
- L E A N J – invalid.

Hmm, seems scarce. Let’s try A in position 3, E in position 2:

L E A _ _  
We need two more letters. Let’s try L E A N Y – invalid.  
L E A N G – invalid.  
L E A N B – invalid.  
L E A N K – invalid.  
L E A N F – invalid.  
L E A N V – invalid.  
L E A N H – invalid.  
L E A N I – invalid.  
L E A N Q – invalid.  
L E A N U – invalid.  
L E A N X – invalid.  
L E A N Z – invalid.  
L E A N J – invalid.

Wait, “LEANT” – but T is forbidden.  
“LEANS” – S forbidden.  
“LEACH” – C forbidden.  
“LEAFY” – Y is allowed, but is “LEAFY” valid? Yes, it is.  
Check constraints:
- L E A F Y
- Contains L (pos 1 ✓), A (pos 3, allowed), E (pos 2, allowed).  
- No forbidden letters.  
- E is in pos 2 (allowed).  
- A is in pos 3 (allowed).  
- Y is allowed.  
This fits perfectly.

So the next guess is “LEAFY”.
