### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance to identify or eliminate several key letters early on.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance to identify or eliminate several key letters early on.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- L(x) → L is NOT in the word.
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- T(x) → T is NOT in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word, but NOT in the 5th position.

So far we know:
- The word contains the letter E somewhere (but not at the end).
- The letters S, L, A, T are excluded.

Next guess should:
1. Include E in a different position (not 5th).
2. Use other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (like R, N, I, O, C, H, etc.).
3. Avoid S, L, A, T.

A strong candidate is “CHORE”:
- C, H, O, R are new letters.
- E is included but not in the 5th position (it’s in 4th here).
This tests several new common letters while respecting the constraints.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

So the secret word must contain both E and R, and it may contain other letters that have not yet been tested.  
We also know E cannot be in position 5 (from SLATE) and R cannot be in position 4 (from CHORE).

Good remaining common letters to test: I, N, U, D, M, P, G, B, F, Y, W, K, V, etc.

A strategic next word should:
1. Include both E and R.
2. Place them in positions that haven’t been ruled out yet.
3. Introduce several new, common letters.

Candidate word: “UNDER”
- Contains U, N, D (new letters) and E, R (known letters).

2. Use other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (like R, N, I, O, C, H, etc.).

We still need to place R and N in the remaining three positions (1, 2, 3).

Remaining common letters we haven’t tested: F, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try a word that:
- Keeps E in position 4.
- Places R and N in new positions (R not in 5, N not in 2).
- Introduces a couple of fresh letters.

Candidate word: “FRANK”
- F, K are new letters.
- R is in position 1 (allowed).
- N is in position 2 (but we know N is NOT in position 2 from UNDER feedback).  
  ❌ Conflict: N cannot be in position 2.

Next candidate: “PRUNE”
- P is new.
- R is in position 2 (allowed).
- N is in position 3 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (fixed).
- U is already excluded.  
  ❌ Conflict: U is excluded.

Next candidate: “PERKY”
- P, K, Y are new.
- R is in position 2 (allowed).
- N is missing.  
  ❌ We must include N.

Next candidate: “NERVE”
- N is in position 1 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (fixed).
- R is in position 2 (allowed).
- V is new.
- E is repeated (allowed).
This satisfies all constraints.

Let’s summarize everything we now know after five guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x):  
S, L, A, T, C, H, O, U, D, B, I, G, V

Letters that ARE in the word, but whose positions are still unknown (-):  
N, R, E (E is fixed in position 4)

So the pattern is: _ _ _ E _

We still need to place N and R in positions 1, 2, or 3, with the following constraints:
- N cannot be in position 2 (from UNDER) and cannot be in position 1 (from NERVE)  
- R cannot be in position 5 (from CHORE) and cannot be in position 2 (from NERVE)  
- Therefore, the only remaining positions for N and R are:
  – N in position 3  
  – R in position 1 or 3 (but 3 is taken by N) → R must be in position 1

So the word must be R _ N E _, with the middle letter being any unused letter.

Unused common letters we haven’t tried yet: F, K, M, P, W, Y, etc.

Candidate word: “RIVEN” – but V is excluded.  
Candidate word: “RINKY” – Y is new, K is new.  
Candidate word: “RIMPY” – M, P, Y are new.  
Candidate word: “RIPEN” – P is new, but E is already in position 4.  
Candidate word: “RANKY” – A is excluded.  
Candidate word: “RECKY” – C, K, Y: C is excluded.  
Candidate word: “REBKY” – B is excluded.  
Candidate word: “REJKY” – not a valid word.  
Candidate word: “RIPEN” – P is new, but E is already fixed.  
Candidate word: “RIMPY” – M, P, Y are new.  
Candidate word: “RINKY” – I is excluded.  
Candidate word: “RUMPY” – U is excluded.  
Candidate word: “RYMPK” – invalid.  
Candidate word: “RIMPY” – valid word.

Let’s pick “RIMPY”:
- R in position 1 (allowed).  
- I, M, P, Y are new letters.  
- N is in position 3 (allowed).  
- E is in position 4 (fixed).  
- P is new.  
- Y is new.

This satisfies all constraints.
