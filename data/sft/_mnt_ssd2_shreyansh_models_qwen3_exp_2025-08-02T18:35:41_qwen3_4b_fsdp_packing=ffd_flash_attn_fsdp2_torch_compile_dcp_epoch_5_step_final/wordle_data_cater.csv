### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)

This will help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word. If any of these letters are in the word, the feedback will guide me to the next guess.

The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.\n\nLooking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:\n- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)\n- 2 common consonants (R, S)\n\nThis will help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the latest feedback:

- Positions 2,3,4 are confirmed: A T E
- Position 5 is confirmed: R
- Position 1 is NOT confirmed (L is x, so first letter is NOT L)
- Letters already ruled out: O, S, D, L

So the word structure is: _ A T E R

We need a 5-letter English word that ends in ""ATER"" and starts with any letter except L, O, S, D.

Possible first letters (common ones): B, C, F, G, H, M, N, P, R, W, Y...

Looking for valid words:
- BATER – not a word
- CATER – valid word
- FATER – not a word
- HATER – valid word
- MATER – valid word
- NATER – not a word
- PATER – valid word
- RATER – valid word
- WATER – valid word
- YATER – not a word

Among these, ""CATER"" is a common word that fits perfectly.
