### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include:
- Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L
- Common vowels like A, E, I, O, U

A popular and effective starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Let's summarize what we know so far:

Letters NOT in the word (from both guesses):
- S, L, A, T, C, O

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
- E (from SLATE) – cannot be in position 5
- R (from CRONE) – cannot be in position 2
- N (from CRONE) – cannot be in position 4
- E (from CRONE) – cannot be in position 5 (re-affirms earlier)

So the word must contain the letters R, N, E, and none of S, L, A, T, C, O.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that uses R, N, E plus two other letters from the remaining pool, while respecting the positional constraints:
- E cannot be in position 5
- R cannot be in position 2
- N cannot be in position 4

Let’s try to construct a word:
- We have R, N, E fixed.
- We need two more letters. Let’s pick common ones like D and I.
- Possible arrangement: D, R, E, N, I → but E cannot be in position 3 (no restriction there), R in position 2 is forbidden, N in position 4 is forbidden.
- Another arrangement: R, D, E, N, I → R in position 1 (ok), D in 2 (ok), E in 3 (ok), N in 4 (forbidden).
- Another arrangement: R, D, N, E, I → R in 1 (ok), D in 2 (ok), N in 3 (ok), E in 4 (ok), I in 5 (ok). This seems valid.

Word: R D N E I → ""RDN EI"" isn't valid. Need a real word.

Alternative: Let’s try ""UNDER"":
- Letters: U, N, D, E, R
- Contains N, E, R (all required)
- Doesn't use any forbidden letters (S, L, A, T, C, O)
- Check positions:
  - E is in position 4 (allowed)
  - R is in position 5 (allowed, only position 2 was forbidden)
  - N is in position 2 (allowed, only position 4 was forbidden)
- All letters are unique and valid.

""UNDER"" looks like a good next guess.

Let's update what we know from all feedback:

Letters NOT in the word (x in any position):
S, L, A, T, C, O, U, D

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:
E, R, N

Position restrictions:
- E cannot be in position 5 (from SLATE) or 4 (from UNDER)
- R cannot be in position 2 (from CRONE) or 5 (from UNDER)
- N cannot be in position 4 (from CRONE) or 2 (from UNDER)

So the word must contain exactly the letters E, R, N, and two other letters chosen from the remaining unused letters. The remaining unused letters (excluding the forbidden set) are: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that uses E, R, N plus two new letters, while respecting the positional bans above.

Let's pick two common remaining consonants: B and F.

Possible arrangement:
We have to place E, R, N plus B and F so that:
- E is in 1, 2, or 3
- R is in 1, 3, or 4
- N is in 1, 3, 4, or 5

Let's try to construct a valid word:
- Let's put N in position 3 (allowed)
- Put R in position 4 (allowed)
- Put E in position 2 (allowed)
- Now we need two more letters. Let's use B and F.
- Possible word: B, E, N, R, F → ""BENRF"" (invalid)
- Rearranging: B, F, E, N, R → ""BFENR"" (invalid)
- Try: F, E, N, R, B → ""FENRB"" (invalid)
- Try: F, N, E, R, B → ""FNERB"" (invalid)
- Try: B, N, E, R, F → ""BNERF"" (invalid)

This isn't working. Let's try a different pair of new letters: G and H.

We need to place E, R, N, G, H with the restrictions:
- E not in 4 or 5 → positions 1,2,3
- R not in 2 or 5 → positions 1,3,4
- N not in 2 or 4 → positions 1,3,5

Let's try:
- Put E in 1
- Put R in 3
- Put N in 5
- Now we have E _ R _ N
- We need two more letters in positions 2 and 4. Let's use G and H.
- Possible word: E, G, R, H, N → ""EGRHN"" (invalid)
- Rearranging: E, H, R, G, N → ""EHRGN"" (invalid)
- Try: G, E, R, H, N → ""GERHN"" (invalid)
- Try: G, E, R, N, H → ""GERNH"" (invalid)
- Try: H, E, R, G, N → ""HERGN"" (invalid)
- Try: H, E, R, N, G → ""HERNG"" (invalid)

This is tricky. Let's try another approach: look for real words that contain only E, R, N plus two other allowed letters, respecting the positional bans.

Looking at possible real words:
- ""INNER"" – contains two N's (but we already know N is in the word once)
- ""NERVE"" – contains E and R in positions 4 and 5 (E is forbidden in 5)
- ""RENTE"" – contains E in 5 (forbidden)
- ""REN"" + need two more letters
- ""RENCH"" – contains C (forbidden)
- ""RENTE"" – E in 5 (forbidden)
- ""REN"" + ""G"" + ""H"" – ""REN"" + ""GH"" – ""RENGH"" (invalid)
- ""REN"" + ""B"" + ""G"" – ""RENBG"" (invalid)

This isn't yielding valid words. Let's try a different pair of new letters: M and P.

We need a word with E, R, N, M, P.

Possible word: ""PERIN"" – but P is in 2 (allowed), E in 3 (allowed), R in 4 (allowed), I is new (but we need M or P), no, this has I which is allowed but we need to check letters.

Wait, we have to use exactly E, R, N plus two new letters. Let's try ""PERIN"" – but this has P, E, R, I, N – but I is allowed, but we need to check positional bans.

- P: allowed
- E: allowed in 3
- R: allowed in 4
- I: allowed
- N: allowed in 5

This seems valid. Let's check:
- Letters: P, E, R, I, N
- All letters are allowed (not in forbidden set)
- Position restrictions:
  - E is in 3 (ok)
  - R is in 4 (ok)
  - N is in 5 (ok)
- This seems valid.

But we need to use two new letters, and I is one, but we need two. So ""PERIN"" uses P, E, R, I, N – that's three new letters (P, I, N) but N is required. This seems okay.

But let's try to use exactly two new letters. Let's try ""PERIN"" – but this has P, E, R, I, N – which is three new letters (P, I, N), but N is required. This seems acceptable.

However, let's try to use exactly two new letters. Let's try ""REIGN"" – but this has G, I, N – but N is required, and G is new, I is new.

Check ""REIGN"":
- R, E, I, G, N
- R is in 1 (ok)
- E is in 2 (ok)
- I is new
- G is new
- N is in 5 (ok)
- All letters allowed
- This seems valid.

This uses two new letters (I, G) plus required E, R, N.

Let's go with ""REIGN"".
