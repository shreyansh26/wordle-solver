### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:

2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words typically contain vowels and frequently used consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it includes:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good mix of letters to test. Another strong option would be ""CRANE"" or ""AROSE"", but ""SLATE"" seems slightly more balanced. I'll go with ""SLATE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- L is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is not in the word (x)
- T is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is correct in position 5 (✓)

So the pattern so far is:
S _ _ _ E

Letters we know are in the word: L, T
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A

We need a word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Ends with E
3. Contains both L and T somewhere in positions 2-4
4. Does NOT contain A

Possible positions for L and T:
- L could be in position 2, 3, or 4
- T could be in position 2, 3, or 4 (but not the same position as L)

Let's brainstorm:
- S T L _ E → STL_E → STLIE? (not valid)
- S T _ L E → ST _ LE → STILE? (valid word: STILE)
- S _ T L E → S T L E? No, that would be STLE but we need 5 letters
- S _ L T E → S _ LTE → SLUTE? (valid word: SLUTE)

Checking SLUTE:
- S ✓
- L in position 2 (was in position 2 in SLATE, but feedback says L is in wrong position, so this might not be correct)
Wait, in SLATE, L was in position 2 and got (-), so L cannot be in position 2 again. So SLUTE would have L in position 2 again, which is invalid.

Next option: STILE
- S ✓
- T in position 2 (was in position 4 in SLATE, so this is new position)
- I (new letter)
- L in position 4 (was in position 2 in SLATE, so this is new position)
- E ✓

This seems valid. Let's check if STILE is a real word. Yes, STILE is a valid 5-letter word (a small step or fence rail).

Another option: S _ _ T E → but T must be in positions 2-4 and we need L somewhere, so:
- S L _ T E → SL_T_E → SLITE? (valid word: SLITE)
Check SLITE:
- S ✓
- L in position 2 (same position as in SLATE, which was marked (-), so invalid)
So SLITE is invalid.

Next: S _ T _ E → but we need L somewhere, so:
- S _ T _ E → but L must be in 2-4 and T must be in 2-4, so:
- S T _ L E → ST _ LE → STILE (already considered)
- S _ T L E → S _ TLE → STLE? No
- S _ _ T L E → but word is 5 letters, so:
- S _ _ T E → but L must be in 2-4, so:
- S _ L T E → S _ LTE → SLTE? No

Best valid word seems to be STILE.

Let me verify:
STILE:
- S(✓) at 1
- T(-) at 2 (was at 4 in SLATE, so new position)
- I (new letter)
- L(-) at 4 (was at 2 in SLATE, so new position)
