For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which aren't. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

A word like ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.

So we now know:
- The word contains O and S somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- The word does not contain A, R, or E.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses O and S (since we know they are in the word).
2. Places O and S in different positions than before (to test new spots).
3. Avoids A, R, E (and any other letters we haven't ruled out).

A good candidate is ""POINT"":
- P, I, N are new letters to test.
- O is now in position 2 (was 3 before).
- S is not used here, but we can test S later if needed.

However, since we know S is in the word, it's better to include S in the next guess to confirm its exact position. Let me think of a word that includes S and O in new positions.

""SOILY"" comes to mind:
- S is now in position 1 (was 4 before).
- O is now in position 2 (was 3 before).

This seems like a solid second guess to gather more information about S, O, I, and L.

- S in position 1 (but we know S is NOT in position 1 from SOILY feedback). So this is invalid.
Next, ""STONY"":
- S in position 1 (again invalid).
Next, ""COSMO"":
- O appears twice, but we already have O in position 2; we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but let's avoid it for now.
Next, ""TONIC"":
- T, N, I (but I is excluded).
Next, ""DONTS"":
- D, N, T are fresh, S in position 5 (valid), O in position 2. This seems good.

Let me verify:
- D, O, N, T, S.
- O is in position 2 (✓ from feedback).
- S is in position 5 (new position, valid).
- D, N, T are new letters not yet tested.

This looks like a solid third guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which aren't. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

A word like ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions. If any of these letters appear in the feedback, I'll know their positions right away. If not, I'll have a good starting point to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word contains O and S somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- The word does not contain A, R, or E.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses O and S (since we know they are in the word).
2. Places O and S in different positions than before (to test new spots).
3. Avoids A, R, E (and any other letters we haven't ruled out).

A good candidate is ""POINT"":
- P, I, N are new letters to test.
- O is now in position 2 (was 3 before).
- S is not used here, but we can test S later if needed.

However, since we know S is in the word, it's better to include S in the next guess to confirm its exact position. Let me think of a word that includes S and O in new positions.

""SOILY"" comes to mind:
- S is now in position 1 (was 4 before).
- O is now in position 2 (was 3 before).
- I and L are new letters.

This seems like a solid second guess to gather more information about S, O, I, and L.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: O (fixed at position 2), S (somewhere else).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, I, L, Y.
- We still need to determine the positions of S and the remaining three letters.

We have three unknown positions: 1, 3, 4, 5 (since position 2 is O). We know S must be in one of these, and we need three more letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the known absent letters).

From all feedback so far:

- Fixed letters: O in position 2, N in position 3, S in position 5  
  Pattern: _ O N _ S

- Letters already ruled out: A, R, E, I, L, Y, D, T, M, K  
  Still-allowed common letters for the two unknown slots (positions 1 and 4): B, C, F, G, H, P, U, V, W, etc.

We need two different letters (or possibly the same letter twice) from the still-allowed set to fill positions 1 and 4.

A quick scan of common English 5-letter words that fit _ON_S and use only allowed letters:

- BONDS – but D is excluded  
- CONNS – N already used in position 3; N is allowed to repeat? We don’t know yet.  
- FONTS – T is excluded  
- GONFS – not a valid word  
- HONKS – H is allowed, K is excluded  
- PONDS – D excluded  
- VONDS – not a word  
- WONKS – K excluded  

The only valid remaining candidate that uses two fresh letters (C and H) and hasn’t been ruled out is:

C H O N S → “CHONS” is not a valid English word.

Next simplest: try C in position 1 and H in position 4 → “CHONS” invalid.

Try C in position 1 and B in position 4 → “C OBNS” invalid.

Try C in position 1 and P in position 4 → “C O N P S” → “CONPS” invalid.

So “CONNS” fits the pattern and only uses letters we haven’t excluded.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which aren't. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

A word like ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This should give me good information about which of these letters are in the word and their positions. If any of these letters appear in the feedback, I'll know their positions right away. If not, I'll have a good starting point to narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we now know:
- The word contains O and S somewhere, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- The word does not contain A, R, or E.

Next, I want a word that:
1. Uses O and S (since we know they are in the word).
2. Places O and S in different positions than before (to test new spots).
3. Avoids A, R, E (and any other letters we haven't ruled out).

A good candidate is ""POINT"":
- P, I, N are new letters to test.
- O is now in position 2 (was 3 before).
- S is not used here, but we can test S later if needed.

However, since we know S is in the word, it's better to include S in the next guess to confirm its exact position. Let me think of a word that includes S and O in new positions.

""SOILY"" comes to mind:
- S is now in position 1 (was 4 before).
- O is now in position 2 (was 3 before).
- I and L are new letters.

This seems like a solid second guess to gather more information about S, O, I, and L.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: SOILY -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) I(x) L(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on SOILY:
- S(-) → S is in the word but NOT in position 1.
- O(✓) → O is in the word AND in position 2.
- I(x), L(x), Y(x) → none of I, L, Y appear in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: O (fixed at position 2), S (somewhere else).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, I, L, Y.
- We still need to determine the positions of S and the remaining three letters.

We have three unknown positions: 1, 3, 4, 5 (since position 2 is O). We know S must be in one of these, and we need three more letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the known absent letters).

Good remaining common letters to test are T, N, D, C, M, P, etc. Let me pick a word that:
1. Has O in position 2.
2. Places S in a new position (positions 3, 4, or 5).
3. Uses three fresh, common letters not yet ruled out.

A strong candidate is ""SONIC"":
- S in position 1 (but we know S is NOT in position 1 from SOILY feedback). So this is invalid.
Next, ""STONY"":
- S in position 1 (again invalid).
Next, ""COSMO"":
- O appears twice, but we already have O in position 2; we don't know if duplicates are allowed, but let's avoid it for now.
Next, ""TONIC"":
- T, N, I (but I is excluded).
Next, ""DONTS"":
- D, N, T are fresh, S in position 5 (valid), O in position 2. This seems good.

Let me verify:
- D, O, N, T, S.
- O is in position 2 (✓ from feedback).
- S is in position 5 (new position, valid).
- D, N, T are new letters not yet tested.

This looks like a solid third guess.

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E
   - Letters in the word (somewhere): O, S

2. SOILY → S(-) O(✓) I(x) L(x) Y(x)
   - Letters NOT in the word: I, L, Y
   - O is fixed in position 2
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1

3. DONTS → D(x) O(✓) N(✓) T(x) S(✓)
   - Letters NOT in the word: D, T
   - O is fixed in position 2
   - N is in the word and is in position 3
   - S is in the word and is in position 5

Current confirmed information:
- Word pattern: _ O N _ S
- Letters known to be in the word: O (pos 2), N (pos 3), S (pos 5)
- Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, E, I, L, Y, D, T
- Remaining letters to test: positions 1 and 4

Common letters not yet excluded: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, etc.

We need two letters for positions 1 and 4. Let's pick common ones that haven't been ruled out.

A good candidate is ""CONNS"":
- C in position 1 (new)
- O in position 2 (confirmed)
- N in position 3 (confirmed)
- N in position 4 (possible duplicate)
- S in position 5 (confirmed)

But ""CONNS"" has N twice, and we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Let's try ""COONS"":
- C in position 1
- O in position 2
- O in position 3 (but position 3 is N, so this is invalid)

Next, ""MONKS"":
- M in position 1
- O in position 2
- N in position 3
- K in position 4
- S in position 5

This fits the pattern _ O N _ S and uses new letters M and K.

Let me verify:
- M and K have not been excluded
- Pattern matches confirmed positions

- Letters already ruled out: A, R, E, I, L, Y, D, T, M, K  
  Still-allowed common letters for the two unknown slots (positions 1 and 4): B, C, F, G, H, P, U, V, W, etc.

We need two different letters (or possibly the same letter twice) from the still-allowed set to fill positions 1 and 4.

A quick scan of common English 5-letter words that fit _ON_S and use only allowed letters:

- CONNS – N already used in position 3; N is allowed to repeat? We don’t know yet.

The only valid remaining candidate that uses two fresh letters (C and H) and hasn’t been ruled out is:

C H O N S → “CHONS” is not a valid English word.

Next simplest: try C in position 1 and H in position 4 → “CHONS” invalid.

Try C in position 1 and B in position 4 → “C OBNS” invalid.

Try C in position 1 and P in position 4 → “C O N P S” → “CONPS” invalid.

Try C in position 1 and G in position 4 → “CONGS” – not a word.

Try B in position 1 and C in position 4 → “B O N C S” → “BONCS” invalid.

Try P in position 1 and C in position 4 → “P O N C S” → “PONCS” invalid.

Try P in position 1 and B in position 4 → “P O N B S” → “PONBS” invalid.

Try F in position 1 and C in position 4 → “F O N C S” → “FONCS” invalid.

Try G in position 1 and C in position 4 → “G O N C S” → “GONCS” invalid.

Try C in position 1 and C in position 4 → “C O N C S” → “CONCS” invalid.

Try C in position 1 and N in position 4 → “C O N N S” → “CONNS” – valid word, and N hasn’t been ruled out for position 4.

So “CONNS” fits the pattern and only uses letters we haven’t excluded.

From the feedback on CONNS:

- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- O(✓) → O is in position 2 (confirmed).
- N(✓) → N is in position 3 (confirmed).
- N(-) → There is another N in the word, but it is NOT in position 4.
- S(✓) → S is in position 5 (confirmed).

So the pattern is now: _ O N _ S with the additional constraint that the fourth letter is NOT N (because the other N is in position 3 and cannot be in position 4).

Letters already ruled out: A, R, E, I, L, Y, D, T, M, K, C.

Still-allowed common letters for positions 1 and 4: B, F, G, H, P, U, V, W, etc.

We need two different letters (or possibly the same letter twice) from the still-allowed set to fill positions 1 and 4, and the fourth letter must be something other than N.

Looking for valid English words that fit _ON_S with allowed letters:

- BONDS – D excluded  
- FONDS – D excluded  
- GONFS – not a word  
- HONKS – K excluded  
- PONDS – D excluded  
- VONDS – not a word  
- WONKS – K excluded  

The only remaining candidate that uses two fresh letters (B and H) and hasn’t been ruled out is:

B O N H S → “BONHS” invalid.

Wait, let me try B in position 1 and H in position 4 → “BONHS” invalid.

Next, try B in position 1 and F in position 4 → “BONFS” invalid.

Try B in position 1 and G in position 4 → “BONGS” – valid word.

Check letters: B, O, N, G, S. All letters are allowed (B, G not yet excluded).

Therefore, the next guess is BONGS.
