For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common consonants in English are R, S, T, L, N, and common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. A good starting word should have a mix of these.

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""STARE"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give good coverage for identifying which letters are in the word and their positions.

Let's consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1: AROSE
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x), O(x), S(x) → R, O, S are not in the word.
- E(-)  → E is in the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 2: LEANT
- L(-)  → L is in the word but not in position 1.
- E(✓)  → E is in position 2 (correct placement).
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(x), T(x) → N, T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A, E, L
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S, N, T
- Positions we have fixed: position 2 = E
- Possible positions for A: 2,3,4,5 (but 2 is E, so 3,4,5)
- Possible positions for L: 2,3,4,5 (but 2 is E, so 3,4,5)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, E, L.
2. Has E in position 2.
3. Does not contain R, O, S, N, T.
4. Uses other letters we haven't ruled out.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A and E are already used, and O is out).

Let's try to construct a word with E fixed in position 2:
_ E _ _ _

We need A and L somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5, and possibly other letters.

Possible structure: A E L _ _ or L E A _ _ or _ E A L _ or _ E _ A L, etc.

Let's try ""PEACH"":
- P, C, H are new letters.
- E is in position 2 (correct).
- A is in position 3 (not ruled out).
- L is missing - we need to include L.

So ""PEACH"" is invalid because it lacks L.

Next, let's try ""BLEAK"":
- B, L, A, K are new letters.
- E is in position 2 (correct).
- A is in position 4 (not ruled out).
- L is in position 3 (not ruled out).
- Letters used: B, L, E, A, K - none are in the excluded list (R,O,S,N,T).

Possible structure: A E L _ _ or L E A _ _ or _ E A L _ or _ E _ A L, etc.

Let's try ""PEACH"":
- P, C, H are new letters.
- E is in position 2 (correct).
- A is in position 3 (not ruled out).
- L is missing - we need to include L.

So ""PEACH"" is invalid because it lacks L.

Next, let's try ""BLEAK"":
- B, L, A, K are new letters.
- E is in position 2 (correct).
- A is in position 4 (not ruled out).
- L is in position 3 (not ruled out).
- Letters used: B, L, E, A, K - none are in the excluded list (R,O,S,N,T).

This seems valid.

Let's check:
- B: new

- A: must be in word (from feedback)
- K: new

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common consonants in English are R, S, T, L, N, and common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. A good starting word should have a mix of these.

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""STARE"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give good coverage for identifying which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is not the word (x)
- S is not the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S
- Letters in the word but misplaced: A, E

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and E (but not in positions 1 or 5 respectively)
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, B, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and E are already known)

Possible structure: since A and E are present, maybe A _ _ E _ or E _ A _ _ or similar.

Let's try ""LEANT"":
- L, N, T are common and untested
- Contains A (position 2) and E (position 4)
- Doesn't contain R, O, S
- A is in position 2 (originally in 1, so new position)
- E is in position 4 (originally in 5, so new position)

This seems like a good second guess.

Let's consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1: AROSE
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x), O(x), S(x) → R, O, S are not in the word.
- E(-)  → E is in the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 2: LEANT
- L(-)  → L is in the word but not in position 1.
- E(✓)  → E is in position 2 (correct placement).
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(x), T(x) → N, T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A, E, L
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S, N, T
- Positions we have fixed: position 2 = E
- Possible positions for A: 2,3,4,5 (but 2 is E, so 3,4,5)
- Possible positions for L: 2,3,4,5 (but 2 is E, so 3,4,5)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, E, L.
2. Has E in position 2.
3. Does not contain R, O, S, N, T.
4. Uses other letters we haven't ruled out.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A and E are already used, and O is out).

Let's try to construct a word with E fixed in position 2:
_ E _ _ _

We need A and L somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5, and possibly other letters.

Possible structure: A E L _ _ or L E A _ _ or _ E A L _ or _ E _ A L, etc.

Let's try ""PEACH"":
- P, C, H are new letters.
- E is in position 2 (correct).
- A is in position 3 (not ruled out).
- L is missing - we need to include L.

So ""PEACH"" is invalid because it lacks L.

Next, let's try ""BLEAK"":
- B, L, A, K are new letters.
- E is in position 2 (correct).
- A is in position 4 (not ruled out).
- L is in position 3 (not ruled out).
- Letters used: B, L, E, A, K - none are in the excluded list (R,O,S,N,T).

This seems valid.

Let's check:
- B: new
- L: must be in word (from feedback)
- E: correct in position 2
- A: must be in word (from feedback)
- K: new

Let's update everything we now know after four guesses.

2. Letters that ARE in the word (from all - and ✓):

4. Additional positional information from the new feedback:

     - L is in the word but NOT in position 1
     - A is in the word but NOT in position 5 (but we already know A is in position 4, so this is consistent)

5. Therefore, the remaining letters must be chosen from the unused alphabet, excluding:
   R, O, S, N, T, B, K, I, C

6. Remaining usable letters (consonants and vowels):
   D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, U

7. The word structure is:
   _ E _ A _

8. We know L must appear exactly once and must be in position 3 or 5 (since it cannot be in 1 or 2).

   - If L is in position 3:  _ E L A _
   - If L is in position 5:  _ E _ A L

Let's explore both cases.

Case 1: L in position 3 → _ E L A _
We need a letter for position 1 and 5 from the remaining pool (D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, U).

Possible combinations:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common consonants in English are R, S, T, L, N, and common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. A good starting word should have a mix of these.

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""STARE"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give good coverage for identifying which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is not the word (x)
- S is not the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S
- Letters in the word but misplaced: A, E

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and E (but not in positions 1 or 5 respectively)
2. Does NOT contain R, O, S
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, B, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and E are already known)

Possible structure: since A and E are present, maybe A _ _ E _ or E _ A _ _ or similar.

Let's try ""LEANT"":
- L, N, T are common and untested
- Contains A (position 2) and E (position 4)
- Doesn't contain R, O, S
- A is in position 2 (originally in 1, so new position)
- E is in position 4 (originally in 5, so new position)

This seems like a good second guess.

Let's consolidate what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1: AROSE
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x), O(x), S(x) → R, O, S are not in the word.
- E(-)  → E is in the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 2: LEANT
- L(-)  → L is in the word but not in position 1.
- E(✓)  → E is in position 2 (correct placement).
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(x), T(x) → N, T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A, E, L
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S, N, T
- Positions we have fixed: position 2 = E
- Possible positions for A: 2,3,4,5 (but 2 is E, so 3,4,5)
- Possible positions for L: 2,3,4,5 (but 2 is E, so 3,4,5)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, E, L.
2. Has E in position 2.
3. Does not contain R, O, S, N, T.
4. Uses other letters we haven't ruled out.

Remaining common consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A and E are already used, and O is out).

Let's try to construct a word with E fixed in position 2:
_ E _ _ _

We need A and L somewhere in positions 1,3,4,5, and possibly other letters.

Possible structure: A E L _ _ or L E A _ _ or _ E A L _ or _ E _ A L, etc.

Let's try ""PEACH"":
- P, C, H are new letters.
- E is in position 2 (correct).
- A is in position 3 (not ruled out).
- L is missing - we need to include L.

So ""PEACH"" is invalid because it lacks L.

Next, let's try ""BLEAK"":
- B, L, A, K are new letters.
- E is in position 2 (correct).
- A is in position 4 (not ruled out).
- L is in position 3 (not ruled out).
- Letters used: B, L, E, A, K - none are in the excluded list (R,O,S,N,T).

This seems valid.

Let's check:
- B: new
- L: must be in word (from feedback)
- E: correct in position 2
- A: must be in word (from feedback)
- K: new

""BLEAK"" satisfies all constraints.

From Guess 1: AROSE
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x), O(x), S(x) → R, O, S are not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 2: LEANT
- L(-) → L is in the word but not in position 1.
- E(✓) → E is in position 2 (fixed).
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(x), T(x) → N, T are not in the word.

From Guess 3: BLEAK
- B(x) → B is not in the word.
- L(-) → L is in the word but not in position 2 (already knew it's not in position 1).
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 3 (but we already know E is in position 2, so this is consistent).
- A(✓) → A is in position 4 (fixed).
- K(x) → K is not in the word.

Summary of constraints:
- Letters in the word: A, E, L
- Letters not in the word: R, O, S, N, T, B, K
- Fixed positions:
  – Position 2 = E
  – Position 4 = A
- Remaining positions (1, 3, 5) must contain L and two new letters (since the word is 5 letters and we already have A, E, L).

We need a 5-letter word with:
_ E _ A _
and it must contain L exactly once, plus two other letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the banned letters).

Remaining usable consonants: C, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining usable vowels: I, U (since A and E are already used, and O is out).

We know L must appear in either position 1, 3, or 5.

Let's try possible placements:

Option 1: L in position 1 → L E _ A _
We need a letter for position 3 and 5. Possible letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, M, P, U, V, W, Y
Let's try ""LEICA"":
- L E I C A
- Letters: L, E, I, C, A
- I and C are new and allowed.
- Contains A, E, L.
- Positions: A in 4 (✓), E in 2 (✓), L in 1 (allowed since L can be in 1,3,5).

But ""LEICA"" has C and I which are new and allowed.

Option 2: L in position 3 → _ E L A _
We need letters for positions 1 and 5. Possible letters: C, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, I, U
Let's try ""CHELA"":
- C H E L A
- Letters: C, H, E, L, A
- C and H are new and allowed.
- Contains A, E, L.
- Positions: A in 4 (✓), E in 2 (✓), L in 3 (allowed).

Option 3: L in position 5 → _ E _ A L
We need letters for positions 1 and 3. Possible letters: C, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, I, U
Let's try ""PEACH"":
- P E A C H
- But this lacks L, so invalid.

Let's choose ""LEICA"" as it uses common letters and satisfies all constraints.

Check:
- L in position 1 (allowed)
- E in position 2 (fixed ✓)
- I new
- C new
- A in position 4 (fixed ✓)
- No banned letters (R,O,S,N,T,B,K)

   - Guess 4: LEICA → L(-) E(✓) I(x) C(x) A(-)
     - L is in the word but NOT in position 1
     - A is in the word but NOT in position 5 (but we already know A is in position 4, so this is consistent)

5. Therefore, the remaining letters must be chosen from the unused alphabet, excluding:
   R, O, S, N, T, B, K, I, C

6. Remaining usable letters (consonants and vowels):
   D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, U

7. The word structure is:
   _ E _ A _

8. We know L must appear exactly once and must be in position 3 or 5 (since it cannot be in 1 or 2).

   - If L is in position 3:  _ E L A _
   - If L is in position 5:  _ E _ A L

Let's explore both cases.

Case 1: L in position 3 → _ E L A _
We need a letter for position 1 and 5 from the remaining pool (D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, U).

Possible combinations:
- D E L A M
- F E L A D
- G E L A M
- H E L A M
- M E L A D
- P E L A M
- V E L A M
- W E L A M
- Y E L A M
- U E L A M

Looking at these, ""DELLA"" is invalid because it has two L's. ""FELAD"" isn't a valid English word. ""GELAM"" isn't valid. ""HELAM"" isn't valid. ""PELAM"" isn't valid. ""VELAM"" isn't valid. ""WELAM"" isn't valid. ""YELAM"" isn't valid. ""ULEAM"" isn't valid.

However, ""D E L A M"" is ""DELLAM"" which isn't valid. ""F E L A M"" is ""FELAM"" which isn't valid. ""G E L A M"" is ""GELAM"" which isn't valid. ""H E L A M"" is ""HELAM"" which isn't valid. ""M E L A D"" is ""MElad"" which isn't valid. ""P E L A M"" is ""PELAM"" which isn't valid. ""V E L A M"" is ""VELAM"" which isn't valid. ""W E L A M"" is ""WELAM"" which isn't valid. ""Y E L A M"" is ""YELAM"" which isn't valid. ""U E L A M"" is ""UELAM"" which isn't valid.

None of these seem to form valid English words. Let's try another approach.

Case 2: L in position 5 → _ E _ A L
We need letters for positions 1 and 3 from the remaining pool (D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, U).

Possible combinations:
- D E M A L
- D E F A L
- D E G A L
- D E H A L
- D E M A L
- F E D A L
- F E M A L
- G E D A L
- H E D A L
- M E D A L
- P E D A L
- V E D A L
- W E D A L
- Y E D A L
- U E D A L

Looking at these, ""DEMAL"" isn't valid. ""DEFAL"" isn't valid. ""DEGAL"" isn't valid. ""DEHAL"" isn't valid. ""FEDAL"" is a valid English word (relating to the feudal system). ""FEDAL"" fits the pattern _ E D A L.

""FEDAL"":
- F: new and allowed
- E: fixed in position 2
- D: new and allowed
- A: fixed in position 4
- L: in position 5 (allowed)

""FEDAL"" uses only allowed letters and fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next logical guess is ""FEDAL"".

We now have five pieces of feedback. Let’s list what we know for certain:

1. Letters NOT in the word (from all the x’s):
   R, O, S, N, T, B, K, I, C, F

2. Letters that ARE in the word (from every - and ✓):
   A, E, D, L

3. Fixed positions from the final ✓:
   - Position 2 = E
   - Position 3 = D
   - Position 4 = A
   - Position 5 = L

So the word must be of the form:
_ E D A L

The only remaining slot is position 1. We know the word must be a valid 5-letter English word that starts with one letter not yet ruled out and ends in “EDAL”.

Letters already excluded from position 1: R, O, S, N, T, B, K, I, C, F.

Remaining possible first letters (consonants and vowels not yet eliminated):
G, H, J, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid English word that starts with one of these and ends in “EDAL”.

Looking at the possibilities:
- GEDAL – not a word
- HEDAL – not a word
- JEDAL – not a word
- MEDAL – valid word
- PEDAL – valid word
- QEDAL – not a word
- UEDAL – not a word
- VEDAL – not a word
- WEDAL – not a word
