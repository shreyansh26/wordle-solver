For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll try to use a word that contains as many of these as possible without repeating letters, to maximize information gain.

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E, all very common letters. This should give me good coverage to determine which of these letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word.

So we know:
1. The word contains an A, but not in the first position.
2. The letters R, O, S, E are absent.
3. Therefore, the remaining letters must come from the other 19 letters of the alphabet.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes A (but not in position 1).
- Excludes R, O, S, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Looking at remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.

A good candidate is “TULIP”:
- T, U, L, I, P are all still possible.
- It has an A (but wait, “tulip” doesn’t have an A). Let me rethink.

I must include A somewhere after the first letter. Let’s try “PLAID”:
- P, L, A, I, D. This includes A in position 3, and avoids R, O, S, E.

But “plaid” has an A in position 3, which is fine since A is allowed anywhere except position 1. However, “plaid” is a valid word and uses common letters.

Another option is “MADAM”:
- M, A, D, A, M. This repeats A, which might not be optimal for information gain.

A better choice is “PAINT”:
- P, A, I, N, T. A is in position 2, and all letters are still possible.

I’ll go with “PAINT” as it uses common letters, includes A in a new position, and avoids all eliminated letters.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. \n\nLooking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I\'ll try to use a word that contains as many of these as possible without repeating letters, to maximize information gain.\n\nOne such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E, all very common letters. This should give me good coverage to determine which of these letters are in the word and their possible positions.\n\n<guess>arose</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on “arose”:\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position.\n- R, O, S, E are NOT in the word.\n\nSo we know:\n1. The word contains an A, but not in the first position.\n2. The letters R, O, S, E are absent.\n3. Therefore, the remaining letters must come from the other 19 letters of the alphabet.\n\nI need a new 5-letter word that:\n- Includes A (but not in position 1).\n- Excludes R, O, S, E.\n- Uses other common letters to maximize information.\n\nLooking at remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, Y, etc.\n\nA good candidate is “TULIP”:\n- T, U, L, I, P are all still possible.\n- It has an A (but wait, “tulip” doesn’t have an A). Let me rethink.\n\nI must include A somewhere after the first letter. Let’s try “PLAID”:\n- P, L, A, I, D. This includes A in position 3, and avoids R, O, S, E.\n\nBut “plaid” has an A in position 3, which is fine since A is allowed anywhere except position 1. However, “plaid” is a valid word and uses common letters.\n\nAnother option is “MADAM”:\n- M, A, D, A, M. This repeats A, which might not be optimal for information gain.\n\nA better choice is “PAINT”:\n- P, A, I, N, T. A is in position 2, and all letters are still possible.\n\nI’ll go with “PAINT” as it uses common letters, includes A in a new position, and avoids all eliminated letters.\n\n<guess>paint</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: paint -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(✓) I(✓) N(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback on “paint”:\n- P is not in the word (x).\n- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, ✓).\n- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3, ✓).\n- N is not in the word (x).\n- T is not in the word (x).\n\nSo far we know:\n1.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

1. Word structure:  
   _ A I _ _   (from guess 2: A✓ in pos 2, I✓ in pos 3)

2. Letters that are NOT in the word (from all feedback):  
   R, O, S, E, P, N, T, C, M

3. Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:  
   - A: already locked in position 2  
   - I: already locked in position 3  
   - L: in the word but not in position 2  
   - A (again): same as above  

4. Remaining common letters we have not tested:  
   D, G, B, F, H, K, U, Y, V, W, etc.

5. The pattern is:  
   [unknown] A I [unknown] [unknown]

We need a word that:
- starts with any letter except the banned ones,  
- has A in position 2,  
- has I in position 3,  
- uses only untested letters in positions 1, 4, 5,  
- and is a valid 5-letter English word.

Candidate words fitting _ A I _ _ with fresh letters:  
- BAGGY (B, G, Y untested) – but double G may waste info.  
- DAGGER – uses G twice, G already untested, but double G might not help.  
- FABIO – uses B and O; O is banned.  
- GABBY – G, B untested.  
- HABIT – H, B, T; T is banned.  
- KAYAK – K, Y untested, but double A and K.  
- VAPID – P banned.  
- WAXIM – X not tested, but M banned.  
- DAILY – D, L, Y untested.  
- HAILY – H, L, Y untested.  
- GAILY – G, L, Y untested.

The cleanest choice is “DAILY”:
- D, L, Y are all new letters.  
- It tests D in position 1, L in position 4, Y in position 5.  
- No banned letters appear.

Therefore, the next logical guess is DAILY.
