### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

""SLATE"" is a good choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-). 

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but NOT in position 3.
2. The word does NOT contain S, L, T, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A somewhere other than position 3.
- Does not contain S, L, T, or E.

Good consonants to try now: R, N, C, D, B, M, P, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, O, U (since A is already known and E is ruled out).

Let’s pick a word that uses A in a different spot and avoids the ruled-out letters. A word like ""CRANK"" uses A in position 2 and introduces C, R, N, K. But let’s check:
- C, R, N, K are all new letters.
- A is in position 2 (not 3), so that fits.

Another option could be ""BRAND"", but ""CRANK"" seems slightly better because K is a good consonant to test.

But let’s check:\n- C, R, N, K are all new letters.\n- A is in position 2 (not 3), so that fits.\n\nAnother option could be ""BRAND"", but ""CRANK"" seems slightly better because K is a good consonant to test.\n\n<guess>CRANK</guess>\n\n<guess>CRANK</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: CRANK -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) K(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two rounds of feedback:\n\n1.

From all feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   – A is in the word but NOT in position 3.

2. CRANK → C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) K(x)
   – C is in the word AND in position 1.
   – A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (same info).

3. CHAMP → C(✓) H(x) A(-) M(x) P(x)
   – C is confirmed in position 1.
   – A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (still same info).
   – H, M, P are NOT in the word.

So we now know:
- The word starts with C.
- It contains A, and A is NOT in positions 2 or 3 (because in CRANK A was in position 3 and got “-”, and in CHAMP A was in position 3 again and still got “-”; so A must be in position 4 or 5).
- Letters ruled out so far: S, L, T, E, R, N, K, H, M, P.

Remaining unused letters: A, B, C, D, F, G, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with C.
- Has A in position 4 or 5.
- Uses only the remaining letters.

Let’s try to place A in position 4: C _ _ A _
We need three more letters from the remaining pool. Let’s think of common consonants: B, D, F, G, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good candidate is “COBIA”:
- Starts with C.
- Has A in position 4.
- Uses O, B, I which are still allowed.
- But COBIA is a valid word.

Another candidate is “CUBIC”:
- Starts with C.
- Has A? No, that’s not possible. We need A.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

""SLATE"" is a good choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-). 

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but NOT in position 3.
2. The word does NOT contain S, L, T, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A somewhere other than position 3.
- Does not contain S, L, T, or E.

Good consonants to try now: R, N, C, D, B, M, P, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, O, U (since A is already known and E is ruled out).

Let’s pick a word that uses A in a different spot and avoids the ruled-out letters. A word like ""CRANK"" uses A in position 2 and introduces C, R, N, K. But let’s check:
- C, R, N, K are all new letters.
- A is in position 2 (not 3), so that fits.

Another option could be ""BRAND"", but ""CRANK"" seems slightly better because K is a good consonant to test.

Guess 2: CRANK -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3.
   - S, L, T, E are NOT in the word.

2. CRANK → C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) K(x)
   - C is in the word AND in position 1.
   - R, N, K are NOT in the word.
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (same as before).

So far we know:
- Word starts with C.
- Contains A, but A is NOT in position 2 (because CRANK had A in position 3 and still got “-”, so A must be in 1, 4, or 5).
- Letters ruled out so far: S, L, T, E, R, N, K.

We need a 5-letter word beginning with C that also contains A (not in position 2) and avoids all the ruled-out letters.

Possible letters left: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to place A in position 4 or 5. A good candidate is “CHAMP”:
- Starts with C.
- Has A in position 4.
- Uses H, M, P which haven’t been tested yet.
- No ruled-out letters.

Let’s check: C(✓) H(?) A(-) M(?) P(?).

This seems like a strong next guess.

From the feedback so far:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   - S, L, T, E are NOT in the word.

2. CRANK → C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) K(x)  
   - C is correct in position 1.  
   - R, N, K are NOT in the word.  
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (confirmed again).

3. CHAMP → C(✓) H(x) A(-) M(x) P(x)  
   - C is still correct in position 1.  
   - H, M, P are NOT in the word.  
   - A is in the word but NOT in position 3 (again confirmed).

Known facts:
- Word starts with C.
- Contains A, but A is NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from CRANK and CHAMP).  
  Therefore A must be in position 4 or 5.
- Letters ruled out so far: S, L, T, E, R, N, K, H, M, P.

Remaining letters that could still appear: A, B, C, D, F, G, I, J, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with C.
- Has A in position 4 or 5.
- Uses only the remaining letters.

Possible candidates:
- C _ _ A _  (A in position 4)
- C _ _ _ A  (A in position 5)

Let’s list valid words:
- CABAL: A in position 3 (invalid, already ruled out)
- CADGE: E is ruled out
- CAGED: E, D – but E is out
- CAIRN: R, N are out
- CAVAL: L, A in 3 (invalid)
- CAVUM: M is out
- CAYOS: S, O – S is out
- CEDAR: E, R, D – E and R are out
- CIGAR: R is out
- CLOUD: L, U, D – L is out
- COBIA: B, I, A – valid letters
- COBIA: C O B I A → starts with C, has A in position 5, uses only allowed letters.

COBIA fits all constraints.

From the new feedback on COBIA:

- C(✓) – still correct in position 1.  
- O(x), B(x), I(x) – O, B, I are NOT in the word.  
- A(-) – A is in the word but NOT in position 5 (confirmed again).

So far we know:
- Word starts with C.
- Contains A, and A must be in position 4 (since positions 2, 3, 5 have all been ruled out for A).
- Letters ruled out: S, L, T, E, R, N, K, H, M, P, O, B, I.

Remaining possible letters: A, C, D, F, G, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word of the form C _ _ A _ using only these remaining letters.

Possible candidates:
- CADAZ – invalid (Z is allowed but CADAZ isn’t a word)
- CAFAN – invalid (N is out)
- CAGAS – invalid (S, G, A, S – S is out)
- CAVAS – invalid (S is out)
- CAYAS – invalid (S is out)
- CUDAL – invalid (U, D, A, L – L is out)
- CUGAR – invalid (R is out)
- CULPA – invalid (U, L, P, A – L, P are out)
- CUBIC – invalid (B, I, C – B, I are out)
- CUDAL – already considered
- CYMAD – invalid (Y, M, A, D – M is out)
- CYANO – invalid (N, O are out)

The only valid word left seems to be CUDAL, but L is out.  
Another candidate: CUGAR – R is out.  
Another: CUDAL – L is out.  
Another: CYANO – N, O are out.  

Let’s check CUGAR – R is out.  
Check CUDAL – L is out.  

Wait, let’s list all possible C _ _ A _ words with remaining letters:

Remaining letters: A, C, D, F, G, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible combinations:
- C U D A _ – but we need 5 letters, and A is in 4th position.  
- C U G A _ – but we need 5 letters.  
- C U F A _ – but we need 5 letters.  

Actually, we need C _ _ A _ with the last letter being any of the remaining letters.

Possible words:
- C U D A Y – CUDAY (not a standard word)
- C U G A Y – CUGAY (not a word)
- C U F A Y – CUFAY (not a word)
- C U V A Y – CUVA Y (not a word)
- C U Z A Y – CUZAY (not a word)
- C U D A L – L is out
- C U G A D – CUGAD (not a word)
- C U F A D – CUFAD (not a word)
- C U V A D – CUVAL (not a word)
- C U Z A D – CUZAD (not a word)
- C U D A Z – CUDAZ (not a word)
- C U G A Z – CUGAZ (not a word)
- C U F A Z – CUF AZ (not a word)
- C U V A Z – CUVAL (not a word)

This seems problematic. Let’s re-examine the constraints.

We have:
- C _ _ A _
- Letters allowed: A, C, D, F, G, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- We need a valid 5-letter word.

Possible valid words:
- C U D A Y – not standard
- C U G A Y – not standard
- C U F A Y – not standard
- C U V A Y – not standard
- C U Z A Y – not standard
- C U D A Z – not standard
- C U G A D – not standard
- C U F A D – not standard
- C U V A D – not standard
- C U Z A D – not standard

This suggests we might have missed earlier. Let’s check if any other letters can be used.

Wait, we have not used D, F, G, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z yet.

Another candidate: C U D A Y – not a word.  
Another: C U G A Y – not a word.  
Another: C U F A Y – not a word.  
Another: C U V A Y – not a word.  
Another: C U Z A Y – not a word.  
Another: C U D A Z – not a word.  
Another: C U G A Z – not a word.  
Another: C U F A Z – not a word.  
Another: C U V A Z – not a word.  
Another: C U Z A D – not a word.  

This seems to indicate no valid word. Let’s re-examine the constraints.
