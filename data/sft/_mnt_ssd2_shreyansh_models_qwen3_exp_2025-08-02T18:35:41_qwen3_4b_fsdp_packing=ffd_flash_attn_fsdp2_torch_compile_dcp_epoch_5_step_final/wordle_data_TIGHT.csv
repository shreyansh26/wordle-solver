### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words cover frequently used vowels and consonants. 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E
- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U

""AROSE"" is particularly good because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage for identifying vowels and common consonants early on.

Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z

A word that fits: T I M H Y → but “timhy” isn’t valid.  
Try T I M B H → “timbh” isn’t valid.  
Try T I M P H → “timph” isn’t valid.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words cover frequently used vowels and consonants. 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E
- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U

""AROSE"" is particularly good because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage for identifying vowels and common consonants early on.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in “arose” (A, R, O, S, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That means none of those letters can appear anywhere in our next guess.  
To maximize information, we want a new set of common letters that avoids A, R, O, S, E entirely.  
Good consonants we haven’t tried yet: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.  
Good vowels we haven’t tried yet: I, U.  

A strong second guess should use fresh common letters.  
“UNTIL” uses U, N, T, I, L – none of which were in the first guess, and it covers two new vowels (U, I) plus three common consonants (N, T, L).  
Another candidate could be “MOUND” or “PLUMB”, but “UNTIL” feels slightly more balanced.

So far we know:
- Letters completely absent: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L
- Letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions: T and I (from the “-” feedback on until)

That leaves the following unused common letters:
Vowels: only Y is left among common ones, but it’s rare
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z

Since T and I are in the word, we need to place them in new positions.  
Also, we want to test new consonants and possibly the remaining vowel Y.

Good candidate consonants to test: C, D, G, H, M, P, W  
Good candidate vowels to test: Y (as a vowel)

Let’s try a word that:
- Contains T and I in different positions
- Adds several new consonants
- Avoids all the letters already ruled out

“DITCH” uses:
- D (new consonant)
- I (known in word)
- T (known in word)
- C (new consonant)
- H (new consonant)

All letters are fresh except I and T, and they’re placed in new positions.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". These words cover frequently used vowels and consonants. 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E
- AROSE: A, R, O, S, E
- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U

""AROSE"" is particularly good because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage for identifying vowels and common consonants early on.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in “arose” (A, R, O, S, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That means none of those letters can appear anywhere in our next guess.  
To maximize information, we want a new set of common letters that avoids A, R, O, S, E entirely.  
Good consonants we haven’t tried yet: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.  
Good vowels we haven’t tried yet: I, U.  

A strong second guess should use fresh common letters.  
“UNTIL” uses U, N, T, I, L – none of which were in the first guess, and it covers two new vowels (U, I) plus three common consonants (N, T, L).  
Another candidate could be “MOUND” or “PLUMB”, but “UNTIL” feels slightly more balanced.

<|im_end|>

So far we know:
- Letters completely absent: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L
- Letters that are in the word but in the wrong positions: T and I (from the “-” feedback on until)

That leaves the following unused common letters:
Vowels: only Y is left among common ones, but it’s rare
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z

Since T and I are in the word, we need to place them in new positions.  
Also, we want to test new consonants and possibly the remaining vowel Y.

Good candidate consonants to test: C, D, G, H, M, P, W  
Good candidate vowels to test: Y (as a vowel)

Let’s try a word that:
- Contains T and I in different positions
- Adds several new consonants
- Avoids all the letters already ruled out

“DITCH” uses:
- D (new consonant)
- I (known in word)
- T (known in word)
- C (new consonant)
- H (new consonant)

All letters are fresh except I and T, and they’re placed in new positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: until -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(-) I(-) L(x)
Guess 3: ditch -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) T(-) C(x) H(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

Letters ruled out completely:  
A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L, D, C

Letters confirmed in the word (positions still unknown):  
I (must be in position 2)  
T (somewhere else, but not position 3)  
H (somewhere else, but not position 5)

Remaining unused common letters:  
Vowels: Y (only one left)  
Consonants: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 2  
- Contains T and H somewhere else (positions 1,4,5 for T; positions 1,2,3,4 for H)  
- Uses only the remaining letters (no A,R,O,S,E,U,N,L,D,C)

Candidate consonants to test: B, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y

Let’s try to build a word:
- Position 2 is I  
- Try T in position 1: T I _ _ _  
- Try H in position 4: T I _ H _  
- Need two more consonants from remaining pool. Good choices: M, P, B, G, K, V, W

A word that fits: T I M H Y → but “timhy” isn’t valid.  
Try T I M B H → “timbh” isn’t valid.  
Try T I M P H → “timph” isn’t valid.  
Try T I G H T → uses T twice (invalid).  
Try T I G H T → same issue.

Let’s try T in position 4: _ I _ T _  
Then H could be in position 1 or 3.  
H I _ T _ → “hither” uses E (ruled out).  
H I M T _ → “himty” isn’t valid.  
H I G T _ → “hight” uses G and T, but “hight” is archaic.  
H I P T _ → “hippy” uses P twice and Y is vowel, but Y is allowed once.

Another approach: place T in position 5: _ I _ _ T  
Then H could be in 1,3,4.  
B I G H T → “bight” (archaic)  
P I G H T → “pight” (archaic)  
M I G H T → “might” (valid word)

“might” uses:
- M (new consonant)  
- I (confirmed in position 2)  
- G (new consonant)  
- H (confirmed somewhere)  
- T (confirmed somewhere)

Positions:
- I in 2 ✓  
- H in 4 ✓  
- T in 5 ✓  
All letters are from the remaining pool and none are ruled out.

So “might” is a strong next guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: until -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(-) I(-) L(x)

Guess 4: might -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(✓) G(✓) H(✓) T(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback on “might”:

- M(x) → M is not in the word.  
- I(✓) → I is in the word and is in position 2.  
- G(✓) → G is in the word and is in position 3.  
- H(✓) → H is in the word and is in position 4.  
- T(✓) → T is in the word and is in position 5.

So the secret word has the pattern:

_ I G H T

We need to find the first letter.  
Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, L, D, C, M.

Remaining common consonants: B, F, J, K, P, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s list valid 5-letter English words that fit “_IGHT”:

- BIGHT  
- FIGHT (but F is still possible)  
- PIGHT (archaic, not in standard word lists)  
- WIGHT (valid, means “dweller” or “spirit”)  
- YIGHT (not a word)  
- ZIGHT (not a word)

Among these, “BIGHT” and “FIGHT” are both valid.  
We have not tested B or F yet, so either could be correct.  
Between the two, “BIGHT” uses B, which has not been tested and is common.

Let’s choose “BIGHT”.
