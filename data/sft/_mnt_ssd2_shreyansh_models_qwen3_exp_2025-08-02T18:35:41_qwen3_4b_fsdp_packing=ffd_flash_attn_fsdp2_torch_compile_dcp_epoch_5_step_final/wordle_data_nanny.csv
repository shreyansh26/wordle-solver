### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include:

- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E - very common letters)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - good vowel coverage)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) which should give good information about letter positions and presence in the word.

Let’s try a word that puts A in the 4th position and uses common consonants and another vowel. A good candidate is ""CHARD"":

From the new feedback on MANGO:

- M(x) → M is NOT in the word.
- A(✓) → A is in the word and is in the correct position (position 2).
- N(✓) → N is in the word and is in the correct position (position 3).
- G(x) → G is NOT in the word.
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, C, H, R, D, M, G, O
- Letters that ARE in the word and in their exact positions: A (position 2), N (position 3)
- Therefore the word has the pattern: _ A N _ _

Remaining unused common letters (excluding the eliminated ones):
B, F, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to fill positions 1, 4, and 5 with letters from the remaining set, ensuring we form a valid 5-letter word.

Possible candidates:
- BAN_ _: BANAL, BANJO (but J is untested), BANAL, BANJO, BANIA (not valid)
- FAN_ _: FANAL (not valid), FANCY (but C is eliminated)
- PANK_: PANKY (not valid)
- VAN_ _: VANDAL (but D is eliminated)
- BANAL: B, A, N, A, L – but L is eliminated
- BANJO: B, A, N, J, O – but O is eliminated
- PANKY: not valid
- BANAL is invalid due to L
- BANJO is invalid due to O
- FANAL: invalid
- KAN_ _: KANGA (but G is eliminated)
- BAN_ _: BANAL (invalid), BANJO (invalid)
- PANK_: PANKY (invalid)
- VAN_ _: VANDAL (invalid)
- BAN_ _: BANAL (invalid), BANJO (invalid)
- FAN_ _: FANCY (invalid)
- KAN_ _: KANGA (invalid)
- BAN_ _: BANAL (invalid)
- PANK_: PANKY (invalid)
- VAN_ _: VANDAL (invalid)

Wait, let me think of valid words with pattern _ A N _ _ using allowed letters.

Valid words:
- BANAL: L eliminated
- BANJO: O eliminated
- FANCY: C eliminated
- KANGA: G eliminated
- PANKY: invalid
- VANDAL: D eliminated
- BAN_ _: BANAL (invalid), BANJO (invalid)
- FAN_ _: FANCY (invalid)
- KAN_ _: KANGA (invalid)
- PANK_: PANKY (invalid)
- VAN_ _: VANDAL (invalid)

Hmm, seems like most common words are invalid. Let me try less common words.

Possible valid words:
- BAN_ _: BANAL (invalid), BANJO (invalid)
- FAN_ _: FANCY (invalid)
- KAN_ _: KANGA (invalid)
- PANK_: PANKY (invalid)
- VAN_ _: VANDAL (invalid)

Wait, let me check if there are any other valid words.

Another approach: list remaining letters: B, F, I, K, P, U, V, W, Y

We need _ A N _ _ with these letters.

Possible combinations:
- B A N _ _: BAN_ _ – need two more letters from remaining. BANAL (L eliminated), BANJO (O eliminated)
- F A N _ _: FANCY (C eliminated), FANAL (invalid)
- K A N _ _: KANGA (G eliminated), KAN_ _
- P A N _ _: PANDA (D eliminated), PANKY (invalid)
- V A N _ _: VANDAL (D eliminated), VANGUARD (too long)
- W A N _ _: WAN_ _ – WANER (E eliminated), WANLY (invalid)
- Y A N _ _: YAN_ _ – YANKS (S eliminated), YANGS (G eliminated)

Seems like most are invalid. Let me try ""PAN"" plus valid letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include:

- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E - very common letters)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - good vowel coverage)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it covers 5 very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) which should give good information about letter positions and presence in the word.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are not in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position.
2. The letters S, L, T, E are not present anywhere in the word.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since position 3 is ruled out).
- Does not contain S, L, T, E.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: R, N, C, H, M, P, D, G, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A is already confirmed and E is ruled out).

Let’s try a word that puts A in the 4th position and uses common consonants and another vowel. A good candidate is ""CHARD"":
- C, H, R, D are common letters not yet eliminated.
- A is in the 4th position (new spot).

From the two rounds of feedback we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
S, L, T, E, C, H, R, D

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are unknown:
A (and it is NOT in positions 3 or 4)

So the word must contain the letter A, and it can only be in positions 1, 2, or 5.

Remaining unused common letters (excluding the eliminated ones):
B, F, G, I, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A exactly once, in position 1, 2, or 5.
- Uses only the remaining letters.
- Is a valid English word.

Let’s try placing A in position 1 and pick common consonants and a vowel. A good candidate is ""BAFAN"" but that’s not a valid word. Let’s try ""BAMBO"" – not valid. ""PANDA"" – but D is eliminated. ""MANGO"" – G and O are allowed, and A is in position 2. That’s valid.

""MANGO"" has:
M, A, N, G, O
A is in position 2 (new position)
Letters used are all allowed.

So let’s go with MANGO.

Current confirmed information:
- Letters in the word: A (position 2), N (position 3), Y (position 5)
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, C, H, R, D, M, G, O, J, K
- Pattern so far: _ A N _ Y

Remaining usable letters (alphabet minus the eliminated ones):
B, F, I, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A in position 2
2. Has N in position 3
3. Has Y in position 5
4. Uses only the remaining letters for positions 1 and 4

Possible combinations for positions 1 and 4:
- Position 1: B, F, I, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z
- Position 4: B, F, I, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (but must form a valid word)

Looking for common English words that fit the pattern:
- BANBY – not a valid word
- FANNY – F, A, N, N, Y – but N is already in position 3; this would have two Ns which is allowed, but let's check letters: F is allowed, N is already confirmed, Y is confirmed. However, the word would be F A N N Y, which is ""fanny"" (slang, but valid in some dictionaries)
- PANNY – P, A, N, N, Y – same issue with double N
- VANNU – not a valid word
- WANNY – W, A, N, N, Y – same double N issue

Actually, looking for valid words:
- BANJO – eliminated letters J and O
- FANCY – C and Y are okay but C is eliminated
- PANDA – D is eliminated
- VAPID – D and I are okay but D is eliminated
- WANDY – D is eliminated

Wait, let's list all possible valid _ A N _ Y words with remaining letters:
- BANBY – invalid
- BANLY – L is eliminated
- FANNY – F, A, N, N, Y – N is allowed twice
- PANNY – P, A, N, N, Y
- WANNY – W, A, N, N, Y

Among these, ""FANNY"" is the most common valid word.

So the next guess is FANNY.
