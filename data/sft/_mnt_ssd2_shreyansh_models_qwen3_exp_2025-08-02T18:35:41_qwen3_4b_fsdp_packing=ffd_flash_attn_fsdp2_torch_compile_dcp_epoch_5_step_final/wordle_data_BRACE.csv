### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which aren't. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these. 

Some popular starting words include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", etc. Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which can help identify many letters in the first guess.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess because it uses very common letters and can quickly narrow down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so it's not in slot 1).
- R is in the correct position (slot 2).
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the correct position (slot 5).

So we know the pattern so far: _ R _ _ E
Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, S
Letters we know ARE in the word (but not yet placed): A (not slot 1), plus any others that might have been excluded.

Since A is in the word but not in slot 1, it must be in slot 3 or 4. Let's try to place it in slot 3 first: _ R A _ E.

Now we need two more consonants for slots 1 and 4. Common consonants not yet used are T, N, L, C, D, etc. Let's pick a word that fits _ R A _ E.

Possible candidates: CRANE (but N is in slot 4, E is already in slot 5 - but we already know E is correct in slot 5, so CRANE would be C R A N E - this fits perfectly: C (slot 1), R (slot 2), A (slot 3), N (slot 4), E (slot 5). This seems like a good candidate because it uses common letters and places A in slot 3.

From the two guesses we now have:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - Pattern: _ R _ _ E
   - Letters known to be in the word: R (slot 2), E (slot 5)
   - Letters known NOT to be in the word: O, S, N

2. CRANE → C(-) R(✓) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
   - Pattern still: _ R _ _ E
   - Additional info:
     - C is in the word but not in slot 1 (so it must be in slot 3 or 4)
     - A is in the word and in the correct position (slot 3)
     - N is not in the word (already known)
   - So the pattern now becomes: _ R A _ E
   - C must occupy slot 4 (since slot 3 is taken by A and slot 1 is unknown)

Therefore the word must be: _ R A C E

The only common 5-letter word that fits this pattern is ""BRACE"" (B in slot 1, R in slot 2, A in slot 3, C in slot 4, E in slot 5).

Let's verify:
- B: not yet tested, but fits the pattern
- R: already known correct in slot 2
- A: already confirmed correct in slot 3
- C: already confirmed in word but not slot 1 - here it is in slot 4
- E: already confirmed correct in slot 5
