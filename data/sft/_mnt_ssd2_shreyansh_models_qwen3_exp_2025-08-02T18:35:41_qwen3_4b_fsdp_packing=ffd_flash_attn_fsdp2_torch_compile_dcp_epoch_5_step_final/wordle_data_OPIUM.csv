### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good first guess should ideally use 5 of these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm several possibilities.

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", and ""STARE"", I've decided on ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and provides a good balance of vowels and consonants. This should give us strong feedback about several key letters right from the start.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, S, E are NOT in the word (x).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains O, but NOT in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, S, E at all.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has O somewhere other than position 3.
2. Avoids A, R, S, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U, Y (since A and E are ruled out, and O is confirmed).

Let's try a word that uses O in a different position and introduces new common letters. ""POINT"" uses P, O, I, N, T - all new letters, and places O in position 2 (not 3). This seems like a strong second guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, N, T  
2. Letters that ARE in the word:  
   - I is in position 3 (✓)  
   - O is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3  
   - P is in the word but NOT in position 1  

So the pattern so far is:  
_ _ I _ _  
with O somewhere in positions 1, 4, or 5, and P somewhere else in positions 2, 4, or 5.

Remaining common consonants we haven’t tried: D, L, C, B, G, H, K, M, F  
Remaining vowels we haven’t tried: U, Y

We need a word that:
- Has I in position 3  
- Contains O in position 1, 4, or 5  
- Contains P in position 2, 4, or 5  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Let’s test a word that satisfies these constraints:  
- O in position 1  
- P in position 2  
- I in position 3  
- Two new consonants in positions 4 and 5

A good candidate is ""OPHYL"" – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Next candidate: ""OPIUM"" – but U is allowed and M hasn’t been ruled out.  
Check: O(1), P(2), I(3), U(4), M(5) – all letters are allowed and constraints are met.

""OPIUM"" is a valid English word meaning a powerful narcotic.
