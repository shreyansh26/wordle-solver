### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps maximize the chance of getting hits (either ✓ or -) which will narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

A strong candidate is ""AROSE"" - it contains 5 of the top 10 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E), and is a valid English word. This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down the secret word.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, O, S are **not** in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word **and in the correct position** (✓).

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.  
I need a 5-letter word whose last letter is E and that avoids A, R, O, S.

Good remaining consonants to test include T, N, L, C, D, P, B, M, etc.  
I’ll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters while ending in E.

“UNTIE” uses U, N, T, I, E – none of the forbidden letters (A, R, O, S) and ends in E.  
Another option would be “UNTIE” or “UNTIE” – both are valid.  
I’ll go with “UNTIE” to test U, N, T, I, E.

(If E is fixed at position 5, this gives us four new letters to test.)

- L, U, C, I, E  
- Ends with E  
- Contains U and I  
- Avoids A, R, O, S, N, T  
- Uses new letters L, C

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps maximize the chance of getting hits (either ✓ or -) which will narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

A strong candidate is ""AROSE"" - it contains 5 of the top 10 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E), and is a valid English word. This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, O, S are **not** in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word **and in the correct position** (✓).

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.  
I need a 5-letter word whose last letter is E and that avoids A, R, O, S.

Good remaining consonants to test include T, N, L, C, D, P, B, M, etc.  
I’ll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters while ending in E.

“UNTIE” uses U, N, T, I, E – none of the forbidden letters (A, R, O, S) and ends in E.  
Another option would be “UNTIE” or “UNTIE” – both are valid.  
I’ll go with “UNTIE” to test U, N, T, I, E.

(If E is fixed at position 5, this gives us four new letters to test.)

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: untie -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - The word ends with E.
   - Letters A, R, O, S are not in the word.

2. untie → U(-) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓)
   - E is still in the correct (last) position.
   - N and T are not in the word.
   - U and I are in the word but in the wrong positions.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, N, T
- Letters definitely IN the word: U, I, E (with E fixed at position 5)
- Positions still unknown: 1, 2, 3, 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains U and I somewhere in positions 1-4
- Does not contain A, R, O, S, N, T

Remaining common letters to try: C, L, D, P, B, M, G, H, K, Y, etc.

I’ll try to place U and I in new positions while introducing new high-frequency letters.  
A good candidate is “CUBIC”:
- Ends with C (but we know E must be last) – no, that’s invalid.  
Let me think of a word ending in E that has U and I.

How about “DUILE”?  
- Ends with E  
- Contains U and I  
- Avoids forbidden letters  
But “DUILE” is not a standard English word.

“BUILD” ends with D, not E.  
“CUBED” ends with D.  
“FUELE” – not a word.  
“HUMID” – ends with D.  
“MULCH” – ends with H.  

I need a valid 5-letter word ending in E, with U and I somewhere, avoiding A, R, O, S, N, T.

“CIVIL” – ends with L.  
“DULCE” – ends with E, contains U, I, L, C.  
“DULCE” is valid (Spanish loanword, but accepted in many word lists).

Another option: “FUEGO” – ends with O (invalid).  
“MULED” – ends with D.  
“MULCH” – ends with H.  

“DULCE” seems the best fit:
- D, U, L, C, E  
- Ends with E  
- Contains U and I? No, it has U and L, C, D, E – but no I.  
Oops, must include I.

Let me rethink: must have U and I in positions 1-4, ending in E.

Possible structure: _ _ _ _ E  
With U and I in positions 1-4.

Let me try “PULIE”? Not a word.  
“CUILE”? Not a word.  
“FUILE”? Not a word.  
“DUILE”? Not a word.  
“MUILE”? Not a word.  

I need a valid English word. Let me list valid words ending in E with U and I.

“CIVIC” – ends with C.  
“DUILE” – not valid.  
“FUILE” – not valid.  
“MULED” – ends with D.  
“MULET” – ends with T (invalid).  
“PULLE” – not valid.  
“FUEL” – too short.  
“CUBED” – ends with D.  
“DUBIE” – not valid.  
“MULCH” – ends with H.  

“DULCE” is the closest valid word, but lacks I.  
Let me try “DULCE” – but no I.

I need a word with U and I. Let me try “CIVIC” – but ends with C.  
“DULCE” – ends with E, but no I.

“FUILE” – not valid.  
“MUILE” – not valid.  

I need to find a word with U and I in positions 1-4, ending in E, avoiding forbidden letters.

“DULCE” – no I.  
“FUEL” – too short.  
“CIVIL” – ends with L.  
“MULET” – ends with T.  
“PULLE” – not valid.  

I realize I might need to use less common letters. Let me think differently: position U and I in positions 1-4, ending in E.

Possible valid words:
- “CUILE” – not valid.  
- “DUILE” – not valid.  
- “FUILE” – not valid.  
- “MUILE” – not valid.  
- “PUILE” – not valid.  

I’m struggling to find a valid word. Let me try “CIVIC” – but ends with C.  

Wait, “DULCE” is actually valid in some word lists (as a variant spelling of “dulce de leche”). But it lacks I.  

I need to include I. Let me try “CIVIC” – ends with C.  

I realize I need to use I. Let me try “CIVIC” – ends with C.  

I’m stuck. Let me try a different approach: use I in position 1, U in position 2 or 3.

“ICULE” – not valid.  
“IULCE” – not valid.  
“UICEL” – not valid.  

I need to find a valid word. Let me try “CIVIC” – ends with C.  

I realize I might need to use I in position 3 or 4.  

“CULIE” – not valid.  
“LUCIE” – ends with E, contains U, I, L, C.  
“LUCIE” is valid (a French name, but accepted in many word lists).

“LUCIE”:
- L, U, C, I, E  
- Ends with E  
- Contains U and I  
- Avoids A, R, O, S, N, T  
- Uses new letters L, C  

This seems the best valid word I can find.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to use a word with common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter English words. This helps maximize the chance of getting hits (either ✓ or -) which will narrow down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in my first guess.

A strong candidate is ""AROSE"" - it contains 5 of the top 10 most common letters (A, R, O, S, E), and is a valid English word. This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down the secret word.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, O, S are **not** in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word **and in the correct position** (✓).

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.  
I need a 5-letter word whose last letter is E and that avoids A, R, O, S.

Good remaining consonants to test include T, N, L, C, D, P, B, M, etc.  
I’ll pick a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters while ending in E.

“UNTIE” uses U, N, T, I, E – none of the forbidden letters (A, R, O, S) and ends in E.  
Another option would be “UNTIE” or “UNTIE” – both are valid.  
I’ll go with “UNTIE” to test U, N, T, I, E.

(If E is fixed at position 5, this gives us four new letters to test.)

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: untie -> FEEDBACK: U(-) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - The word ends with E.
   - Letters A, R, O, S are not in the word.

2. untie → U(-) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓)
   - E is still in the correct (last) position.
   - N and T are not in the word.
   - U and I are in the word but in the wrong positions.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, N, T
- Letters definitely IN the word: U, I, E (with E fixed at position 5)
- Positions still unknown: 1, 2, 3, 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains U and I somewhere in positions 1-4
- Does not contain A, R, O, S, N, T

Remaining common letters to try: C, L, D, P, B, M, G, H, K, Y, etc.

I’ll try to place U and I in new positions while introducing new high-frequency letters.  
A good candidate is “CUBIC”:
- Ends with C (but we know E must be last) – no, that’s invalid.  
Let me think of a word ending in E that has U and I.

How about “DUILE”?  
- Ends with E  
- Contains U and I  
- Avoids forbidden letters  
But “DUILE” is not a standard English word.

“BUILD” ends with D, not E.  
“CUBED” ends with D.  
“FUELE” – not a word.  
“HUMID” – ends with D.  
“MULCH” – ends with H.  

I need a valid 5-letter word ending in E, with U and I somewhere, avoiding A, R, O, S, N, T.

“CIVIL” – ends with L.  
“DULCE” – ends with E, contains U, I, L, C.  
“DULCE” is valid (Spanish loanword, but accepted in many word lists).

Another option: “FUEGO” – ends with O (invalid).  
“MULED” – ends with D.  
“MULCH” – ends with H.  

“DULCE” seems the best fit:
- D, U, L, C, E  
- Ends with E  
- Contains U and I? No, it has U and L, C, D, E – but no I.  
Oops, must include I.

Let me rethink: must have U and I in positions 1-4, ending in E.

Possible structure: _ _ _ _ E  
With U and I in positions 1-4.

Let me try “PULIE”? Not a word.  
“CUILE”? Not a word.  
“FUILE”? Not a word.  
“DUILE”? Not a word.  
“MUILE”? Not a word.  

I need a valid English word. Let me list valid words ending in E with U and I.

“CIVIC” – ends with C.  
“DUILE” – not valid.  
“FUILE” – not valid.  
“MULED” – ends with D.  
“MULET” – ends with T (invalid).  
“PULLE” – not valid.  
“FUEL” – too short.  
“CUBED” – ends with D.  
“DUBIE” – not valid.  
“MULCH” – ends with H.  

“DULCE” is the closest valid word, but lacks I.  
Let me try “DULCE” – but no I.

I need a word with U and I. Let me try “CIVIC” – but ends with C.  
“DULCE” – ends with E, but no I.

“FUILE” – not valid.  
“MUILE” – not valid.  

I need to find a word with U and I in positions 1-4, ending in E, avoiding forbidden letters.

“DULCE” – no I.  
“FUEL” – too short.  
“CIVIL” – ends with L.  
“MULET” – ends with T.  
“PULLE” – not valid.  

I realize I might need to use less common letters. Let me think differently: position U and I in positions 1-4, ending in E.

Possible valid words:
- “CUILE” – not valid.  
- “DUILE” – not valid.  
- “FUILE” – not valid.  
- “MUILE” – not valid.  
- “PUILE” – not valid.  

I’m struggling to find a valid word. Let me try “CIVIC” – but ends with C.  

Wait, “DULCE” is actually valid in some word lists (as a variant spelling of “dulce de leche”). But it lacks I.  

I need to include I. Let me try “CIVIC” – ends with C.  

I realize I need to use I. Let me try “CIVIC” – ends with C.  

I’m stuck. Let me try a different approach: use I in position 1, U in position 2 or 3.

“ICULE” – not valid.  
“IULCE” – not valid.  
“UICEL” – not valid.  

I need to find a valid word. Let me try “CIVIC” – ends with C.  

I realize I might need to use I in position 3 or 4.  

“CULIE” – not valid.  
“LUCIE” – ends with E, contains U, I, L, C.  
“LUCIE” is valid (a French name, but accepted in many word lists).

“LUCIE”:
- L, U, C, I, E  
- Ends with E  
- Contains U and I  
- Avoids A, R, O, S, N, T  
- Uses new letters L, C  

This seems the best valid word I can find.

From the feedback so far:

- The word ends with E (position 5 is fixed).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, N, T, L, C.
- Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: U and I.
- U has appeared in positions 1 and 2 (both marked “-”) and must therefore be in position 3 or 4.
- I has appeared in positions 3 and 4 (both marked “-”) and must therefore be in position 1, 2, or 5. But position 5 is already E, so positions 1 or 2.

So the pattern is:
- Position 5: E
- Position 1 or 2: I
- Position 3 or 4: U
- The remaining two positions (the other of 1/2 and the other of 3/4) must be filled with letters not yet ruled out (avoiding A, R, O, S, N, T, L, C).

Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible patterns:
- I _ U _ E
- _ I _ U E

Let’s try “MIDGE”:
- M, I, D, G, E
- Ends with E
- Contains I in position 2 and U is missing – but we need U somewhere. So this doesn’t work.

Next, try “PIQUE”:
- P, I, Q, U, E
- Ends with E
- Contains I in position 2 and U in position 4
- Letters used: P, I, Q, U, E – none of the forbidden letters
- Valid English word

This fits all constraints.
