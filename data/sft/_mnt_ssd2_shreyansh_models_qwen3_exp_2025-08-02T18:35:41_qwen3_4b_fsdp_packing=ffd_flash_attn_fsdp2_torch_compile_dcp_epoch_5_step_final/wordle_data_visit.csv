For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The goal is to maximize information gain. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll choose a word that uses several of these high-frequency letters in different positions. 

A good first guess should avoid repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible. The word ""AROSE"" uses 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants. This should give me good initial feedback on which letters are present and their possible positions.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but ""AROSE"" has slightly better letter coverage. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S (but not in the 4th position).
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses S somewhere other than position 4.
2. Avoids A, R, O, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Remaining common letters to test: T, I, N, L, U, C, D, P, M, Y, etc.

A good second guess should test several new letters while keeping S. Let's try ""STINT"":
- S in position 1 (new position).
- T, I, N are all common and not yet tested.
- No A, R, O, E.

This should help narrow down positions and confirm or eliminate more letters.

- It contains S somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (since 1 and 4 are ruled out).

The word ""AROSE"" uses 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants. This should give me good initial feedback on which letters are present and their possible positions.\n\nAnother strong candidate is ""SLATE"" (S, L, A, T, E), but ""AROSE"" has slightly better letter coverage.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after three guesses.

Letters we have ruled out completely:
A, R, O, E, N, L, U

Letters we know are in the word:
- S (now confirmed in position 3)
- T (confirmed in position 5)
- I (somewhere, but not in position 3)

So the word looks like: _ _ S _ T  
and it must also contain I somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since 3 is S).

Remaining unused common letters: C, D, F, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has S in position 3.
2. Has T in position 5.
3. Has I in position 1, 2, or 4.
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Let’s list possibilities:

- I _ S _ T: e.g., ISKUT (but U is ruled out), ISLET (E is out), ISKET (E out), etc. None work.
- _ I S _ T: e.g., DISHT (not a word), VISIT (but V is allowed, I is allowed, S and T are correct positions). VISIT fits:
  - V, I, S, I, T
  - Letters: V, I, S, T – all allowed.
  - Positions: S in 3, T in 5, I in 2 (allowed), and V is new.

VISIT satisfies all constraints and introduces V as a new letter to test.

Therefore, VISIT is the optimal next guess.
