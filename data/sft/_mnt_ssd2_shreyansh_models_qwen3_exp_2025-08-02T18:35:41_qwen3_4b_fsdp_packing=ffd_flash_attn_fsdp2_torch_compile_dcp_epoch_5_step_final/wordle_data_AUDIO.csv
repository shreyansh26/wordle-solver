For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U - but D and U are less common)
- AUDIO (uses A, U, D, I, O - but U and D are less common)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it uses C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters. This should give us good information about several key letters right away.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) – C is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- N(x) – N is not in the word at all.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely absent: C, R, N, E.
- Letter definitely present somewhere else: A (but not in position 3).

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter A (but not in the 3rd spot).
2. Does not contain C, R, N, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, W, Y, V, Z, X, Q, J.

Let’s try to pick a word that uses A plus several of these other high-frequency letters while avoiding the forbidden ones. A good candidate is “STALW” (but that’s not a valid word). Another is “PLAID” (but it has E, which we know is absent). 

A valid word that fits is “SLASH”:
- S, L, A, S, H – all letters are allowed (no C, R, N, E).
- A is in position 3, but we already know A is not in position 3, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: “PLATO” – but O is allowed, T is allowed, but we have A in position 3 again.

Next: “PAULS” – P, A, U, L, S – A is in position 2, which is allowed. This uses P, A, U, L, S – all letters are allowed and none are forbidden. This seems good.

Another candidate: “PAINT” – but N is forbidden.

Another: “PAVLO” – but V is allowed, but O is allowed, but this is less common.

“PAULS” seems like the best choice here.

From the two guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   – Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E
   – Letter A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. PAULS → P(x) A(-) U(-) L(x) S(x)
   – Letters not in the word: P, L, S
   – Letter A is in the word but not in position 2 (because it was marked “-” in position 2 here).
   – Letter U is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Forbidden letters: C, R, N, E, P, L, S
- Present letters: A (not in positions 2 or 3), U (not in position 3)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and U.
- Does NOT contain any of C, R, N, E, P, L, S.
- A is not in position 2 or 3.
- U is not in position 3.

Remaining common letters that are still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s look for a word that places A in position 1, 4, or 5 and U in any position except 3, while using other allowed letters.

A good candidate is “FAULT”:
- F, A, U, L, T – but L is forbidden (from PAULS feedback), so this is invalid.

Next: “GAULT” – same issue with L.

Next: “VAULT” – same issue with L.

Next: “MAJOR” – contains R and O, but R is forbidden.

Next: “GLOAT” – contains L and O, but L is forbidden.

Next: “BOAST” – contains S and T, but S is forbidden.

Next: “HUMID” – contains H, U, M, I, D – no forbidden letters, and:
   – A is not present, so this is invalid (we need A).

Next: “MOUNT” – contains O, U, N, T – N is forbidden.

Next: “ABOUT” – contains A, B, O, U, T – all letters are allowed (B, O, U, T not forbidden), and:
   – A is in position 1 (allowed, since it’s not 2 or 3).
   – U is in position 4 (allowed, since it’s not 3).

This seems valid and informative.

Another candidate: “FOAMY” – contains F, O, A, M, Y – all allowed, and:
   – A is in position 3 (forbidden, since A cannot be in 3 from CRANE).

So “ABOUT” is better.

Let’s check “ABOUT”:
- Letters: A, B, O, U, T – none are forbidden.
- A is in position 1 (allowed).
- U is in position 4 (allowed).
- This tests B, O, T which are new letters.

Therefore, “ABOUT” is a good next guess.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U - but D and U are less common)
- AUDIO (uses A, U, D, I, O - but U and D are less common)

Among these, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it uses C, R, A, N, E - all very common letters. This should give us good information about several key letters right away.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) – C is not in the word at all.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- N(x) – N is not in the word at all.
- E(x) – E is not in the word at all.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely absent: C, R, N, E.
- Letter definitely present somewhere else: A (but not in position 3).

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains the letter A (but not in the 3rd spot).
2. Does not contain C, R, N, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, F, K, W, Y, V, Z, X, Q, J.

Let’s try to pick a word that uses A plus several of these other high-frequency letters while avoiding the forbidden ones. A good candidate is “STALW” (but that’s not a valid word). Another is “PLAID” (but it has E, which we know is absent). 

A valid word that fits is “SLASH”:
- S, L, A, S, H – all letters are allowed (no C, R, N, E).
- A is in position 3, but we already know A is not in position 3, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: “PLATO” – but O is allowed, T is allowed, but we have A in position 3 again.

Next: “PAULS” – P, A, U, L, S – A is in position 2, which is allowed. This uses P, A, U, L, S – all letters are allowed and none are forbidden. This seems good.

Another candidate: “PAINT” – but N is forbidden.

Another: “PAVLO” – but V is allowed, but O is allowed, but this is less common.

“PAULS” seems like the best choice here.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PAULS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) U(-) L(x) S(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   – Letters not in the word: C, R, N, E
   – Letter A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. PAULS → P(x) A(-) U(-) L(x) S(x)
   – Letters not in the word: P, L, S
   – Letter A is in the word but not in position 2 (because it was marked “-” in position 2 here).
   – Letter U is in the word but not in position 3.

So far we know:
- Forbidden letters: C, R, N, E, P, L, S
- Present letters: A (not in positions 2 or 3), U (not in position 3)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and U.
- Does NOT contain any of C, R, N, E, P, L, S.
- A is not in position 2 or 3.
- U is not in position 3.

Remaining common letters that are still allowed: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, T, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s look for a word that places A in position 1, 4, or 5 and U in any position except 3, while using other allowed letters.

A good candidate is “FAULT”:
- F, A, U, L, T – but L is forbidden (from PAULS feedback), so this is invalid.

Next: “GAULT” – same issue with L.

Next: “VAULT” – same issue with L.

Next: “MAJOR” – contains R and O, but R is forbidden.

Next: “GLOAT” – contains L and O, but L is forbidden.

Next: “BOAST” – contains S and T, but S is forbidden.

Next: “HUMID” – contains H, U, M, I, D – no forbidden letters, and:
   – A is not present, so this is invalid (we need A).

Next: “MOUNT” – contains O, U, N, T – N is forbidden.

Next: “ABOUT” – contains A, B, O, U, T – all letters are allowed (B, O, U, T not forbidden), and:
   – A is in position 1 (allowed, since it’s not 2 or 3).
   – U is in position 4 (allowed, since it’s not 3).

This seems valid and informative.

Another candidate: “FOAMY” – contains F, O, A, M, Y – all allowed, and:
   – A is in position 3 (forbidden, since A cannot be in 3 from CRANE).

So “ABOUT” is better.

Let’s check “ABOUT”:
- Letters: A, B, O, U, T – none are forbidden.
- A is in position 1 (allowed).
- U is in position 4 (allowed).
- This tests B, O, T which are new letters.

Therefore, “ABOUT” is a good next guess.

From the three guesses we now know:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   – Forbidden letters: C, R, N, E
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. PAULS → P(x) A(-) U(-) L(x) S(x)
   – Forbidden letters add: P, L, S
   – A is in the word but not in position 2.
   – U is in the word but not in position 3.

3. ABOUT → A(✓) B(x) O(-) U(-) T(x)
   – A is in the word and in position 1.
   – Forbidden letters add: B, T
   – O is in the word but not in position 3.
   – U is in the word but not in position 4.

So far:
- Word pattern: A _ _ _ _
- Letters definitely in the word: A, U, O
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, N, E, P, L, S, B, T
- U is not in position 3 or 4.
- O is not in position 3.

Allowed letters left: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A
- Contains both U and O
- Does NOT contain any forbidden letters
- U is in position 2 or 5
- O is in position 2, 4, or 5

Let’s try to place U and O in valid positions and fill the rest with allowed letters.

Option 1: U in position 2, O in position 4
   A U _ O _
   Need one more letter for position 3. Allowed letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, V, W, Y
   Try A U D O _ – but we need a valid word. ""AUDOU"" isn’t valid. ""AUGUR"" has R (forbidden). ""AUDIO"" is valid and uses remaining letters.

Option 2: U in position 5, O in position 2 or 4
   A O _ _ U or A _ _ O U
   ""AFOGU"" isn’t valid. ""AGOUT"" has T (forbidden). ""AMOUR"" has R (forbidden). ""AFOUL"" has L (forbidden). ""AFOGU"" isn’t valid. ""AGOUT"" has T (forbidden). ""AMOUR"" has R (forbidden). ""AFOUL"" has L (forbidden).

"" AUDIO"" seems to be the only valid word fitting all constraints:
- Starts with A
- Contains U and O
- Doesn’t use any forbidden letters
- U is in position 2 (allowed)
