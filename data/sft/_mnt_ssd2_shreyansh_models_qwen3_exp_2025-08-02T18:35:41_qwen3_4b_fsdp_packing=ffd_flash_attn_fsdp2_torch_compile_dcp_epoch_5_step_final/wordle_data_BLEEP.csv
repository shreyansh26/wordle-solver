### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y  
Vowels: E (already known), and we still have not ruled out Y as a vowel.

Since E must appear somewhere in positions 1-3, let’s try a word that:
- Places E in position 1, 2, or 3  
- Uses other high-frequency consonants that haven’t been tried yet  
- Avoids every ruled-out letter

A good candidate is “BEDEW”:
- B, D, W are new consonants.  
- E appears in position 2 (so we can check if E belongs there).  
- No forbidden letters appear.

This should quickly narrow down where E can sit and test three fresh consonants.

3. Position constraints from Guess 3 (bedew):
   - B is correct in position 1 → word starts with B.
   - E in position 2 is wrong → E is NOT in position 2.
   - E in position 4 is correct → E is in position 4.
   - D and W are not in the word (already known).

So the word looks like: B _ _ E _

We need a 5-letter word starting with B, having E in position 4, and avoiding every letter already ruled out.

Remaining consonants to try: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: E (already placed), and we still have not tested Y as a vowel.

A good next word should:
- Start with B  
- Have E in position 4  
- Use new consonants in positions 2 and 3  
- Avoid all forbidden letters

A strong candidate is “BLEND”, but D is already ruled out.  
Next candidate: “BLIME” – but M and I; I is ruled out.  
Next: “BLESS” – S is ruled out.  
Next: “BREEK” – R is ruled out.  
Next: “BEGEM” – G and M are allowed, but double E in positions 2 and 4 is fine, and M is allowed.

Wait, let’s pick a word that uses new letters in positions 2 and 3.  
How about “BEMER”? No, R is out.  
“BEMEN”? N is out.  
“BEGET”? G and T; T is out.  
“BEVEL”? V and L are allowed. This looks good: B E V E L.

Check letters:
B – allowed (position 1)  
E – allowed (position 2, but we know E is NOT in position 2 from bedew feedback) → conflict.

Oops, E in position 2 is wrong. So “BEVEL” is invalid.

Next: “BEMEL”? M and L are allowed, and E is in position 4.  
Word: B E M E L → E in position 2 is wrong, so invalid.

Next: “BEMER” – R is out.  
“BEGEM”? G and M are allowed, E in position 2 is wrong.  

We need E only in position 4. So structure: B _ _ E _

Candidate: “BEMER” – R is out.  
“BEMEN” – N is out.  
“BEGET” – T is out.  
“BEGEM” – G and M are allowed, but E in position 2 is wrong.  

Wait, let’s try “BEGEM” even though E in position 2 is marked as wrong. Actually, the feedback says E(-) in position 2, meaning E is in the word but not in position 2. So “BEGEM” has E in positions 2 and 4. Position 2 E is wrong, but position 4 E is correct. This is acceptable because the feedback only tells us about individual positions, not about duplicates.

So “BEGEM” is valid: B E G E M → E in position 4 is correct, and E in position 2 is wrong. This tests G and M.

But we can do better with a word that has E only in position 4 and uses new consonants in positions 2 and 3.  

Candidate: “BEMER” – R is out.  
“BEMEN” – N is out.  
“BEMEL” – E in position 2 is wrong, but L is allowed.  

Actually, “BEMEL” is valid: B E M E L. Even though E in position 2 is marked as wrong, the word is still valid because we’re testing new letters in positions 2 and 3 (M and E in 4 is correct).

But to avoid duplicate E in position 2, let’s pick a word with E only in position 4 and new consonants in positions 2 and 3.  

Candidate: “BEMER” – R is out.  
“BEMEN” – N is out.  
“BEGEM” – G and M are allowed, and E in position 4 is correct.  

Let’s choose “BEGEM” to test G and M while respecting the constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So the secret word:
- Contains E, but not in position 5.
- Does not contain A, R, O, S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has E somewhere other than the last letter.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out, and E is confirmed).

A strong candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- U and I are new vowels.
- N and T are common consonants.
- E is used but in position 4 (not 5).
- No A, R, O, S.

This should give good coverage of remaining common letters while respecting the constraints.

So far we know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I  
Letters definitely in the word: E (but not in positions 4 or 5)

Remaining common letters to try:  
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y  
Vowels: E (already known), and we still have not ruled out Y as a vowel.

Since E must appear somewhere in positions 1-3, let’s try a word that:
- Places E in position 1, 2, or 3  
- Uses other high-frequency consonants that haven’t been tried yet  
- Avoids every ruled-out letter

A good candidate is “BEDEW”:
- B, D, W are new consonants.  
- E appears in position 2 (so we can check if E belongs there).  
- No forbidden letters appear.

This should quickly narrow down where E can sit and test three fresh consonants.

From all feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word:  
A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, D, W, G, M

Letters confirmed IN the word:  
B (position 1)  
E (must appear at least twice, and we now know it is in position 4)

Word structure:  
B _ _ E _

We have not yet tried these consonants: C, F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z  
We have not yet tested Y as a vowel.

We need a 5-letter word starting with B, having E in position 4, and using only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible consonants for positions 2 and 3: C, F, H, J, K, L, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z

Let’s look for words fitting B _ _ E _ with these constraints.

Candidate: “BLEVE” – V is allowed, but E appears twice, and we already know E is in position 4.  
“BLEED” – D is out.  
“BLEPH” – H is allowed, but P is allowed, and F is allowed.  
“BLEVE” – V is allowed, E is in position 4.  
“BLEEP” – P is allowed.  
“BLEAT” – T is out.  
“BLEED” – D is out.  
“BLESS” – S is out.  
“BLEAK” – K is allowed.  
“BLEND” – D is out.  
“BLECH” – C and H are allowed.  
“BLEVE” – V is allowed.  
“BLEPH” – P is allowed.  
“BLEAK” – K is allowed.  
“BLEED” – D is out.  
“BLEAT” – T is out.  
“BLECH” – C and H are allowed.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position.

So the secret word:
- Contains E, but not in position 5.
- Does not contain A, R, O, S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has E somewhere other than the last letter.
2. Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are out, and E is confirmed).

A strong candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- U and I are new vowels.
- N and T are common consonants.
- E is used but in position 4 (not 5).
- No A, R, O, S.

This should give good coverage of remaining common letters while respecting the constraints.

So far we know:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I  
Letters definitely in the word: E (but not in positions 4 or 5)

Remaining common letters to try:  
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, V, W, Y  
Vowels: E (already known), and we still have not ruled out Y as a vowel.

Since E must appear somewhere in positions 1-3, let’s try a word that:
- Places E in position 1, 2, or 3  
- Uses other high-frequency consonants that haven’t been tried yet  
- Avoids every ruled-out letter

A good candidate is “BEDEW”:
- B, D, W are new consonants.  
- E appears in position 2 (so we can check if E belongs there).  
- No forbidden letters appear.

This should quickly narrow down where E can sit and test three fresh consonants.

Let’s summarize what we now know.

1. Letters NOT in the word:  
   A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, D, W  

2. Letters confirmed IN the word:  
   B (position 1) and E (appears at least twice).

3. Position constraints from Guess 3 (bedew):
   - B is correct in position 1 → word starts with B.
   - E in position 2 is wrong → E is NOT in position 2.
   - E in position 4 is correct → E is in position 4.
   - D and W are not in the word (already known).

So the word looks like: B _ _ E _

We need a 5-letter word starting with B, having E in position 4, and avoiding every letter already ruled out.

Remaining consonants to try: C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z  
Remaining vowels: E (already placed), and we still have not tested Y as a vowel.

A good next word should:
- Start with B  
- Have E in position 4  
- Use new consonants in positions 2 and 3  
- Avoid all forbidden letters

A strong candidate is “BLEND”, but D is already ruled out.  
Next candidate: “BLIME” – but M and I; I is ruled out.  
Next: “BLESS” – S is ruled out.  
Next: “BREEK” – R is ruled out.  
Next: “BEGEM” – G and M are allowed, but double E in positions 2 and 4 is fine, and M is allowed.

Wait, let’s pick a word that uses new letters in positions 2 and 3.  
How about “BEMER”? No, R is out.  
“BEMEN”? N is out.  
“BEGET”? G and T; T is out.  
“BEVEL”? V and L are allowed. This looks good: B E V E L.

Check letters:
B – allowed (position 1)  
E – allowed (position 2, but we know E is NOT in position 2 from bedew feedback) → conflict.

Oops, E in position 2 is wrong. So “BEVEL” is invalid.

Next: “BEMEL”? M and L are allowed, and E is in position 4.  
Word: B E M E L → E in position 2 is wrong, so invalid.

Next: “BEMER” – R is out.  
“BEGEM”? G and M are allowed, E in position 2 is wrong.  

We need E only in position 4. So structure: B _ _ E _

Candidate: “BEMER” – R is out.  
“BEMEN” – N is out.  
“BEGET” – T is out.  
“BEGEM” – G and M are allowed, but E in position 2 is wrong.  

Wait, let’s try “BEGEM” even though E in position 2 is marked as wrong. Actually, the feedback says E(-) in position 2, meaning E is in the word but not in position 2. So “BEGEM” has E in positions 2 and 4. Position 2 E is wrong, but position 4 E is correct. This is acceptable because the feedback only tells us about individual positions, not about duplicates.

So “BEGEM” is valid: B E G E M → E in position 4 is correct, and E in position 2 is wrong. This tests G and M.

But we can do better with a word that has E only in position 4 and uses new consonants in positions 2 and 3.  

Candidate: “BEMER” – R is out.  
“BEMEN” – N is out.  
“BEMEL” – E in position 2 is wrong, but L is allowed.  

Actually, “BEMEL” is valid: B E M E L. Even though E in position 2 is marked as wrong, the word is still valid because we’re testing new letters in positions 2 and 3 (M and E in 4 is correct).

But to avoid duplicate E in position 2, let’s pick a word with E only in position 4 and new consonants in positions 2 and 3.  

Candidate: “BEMER” – R is out.  
“BEMEN” – N is out.  
“BEGEM” – G and M are allowed, and E in position 4 is correct.  

Let’s choose “BEGEM” to test G and M while respecting the constraints.

Let's update what we now know from the five guesses:

1. Letters NOT in the word:  
   A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, D, W, G, M, V

2. Letters confirmed IN the word and their positions:  
   - B is in position 1 (✓)  
   - L is in position 2 (✓)  
   - E is in position 3 (✓)  
   - E is in position 4 (✓)  

   Wait a second – the feedback for “bleve” shows:
   - B(✓) – position 1 correct  
   - L(✓) – position 2 correct  
   - E(✓) – position 3 correct  
   - V(x) – position 4 wrong (but we already know E is in position 4 from earlier feedback)  
   - E(-) – position 5 wrong (but we already know E is in position 4)

   This seems contradictory. Let me re-read the feedback carefully:

   Guess 5: bleve  
   Feedback: B(✓) L(✓) E(✓) V(x) E(-)

   This means:
   - B is correct in position 1  
   - L is correct in position 2  
   - E is correct in position 3  
   - V is not in the word (position 4)  
   - E is in the word but not in position 5  

   But we already know from earlier guesses that:
   - E is in position 4 (from guess 3: bedew → E(✓) in position 4)

   This is a contradiction unless the feedback is interpreted as:
   - B(✓) – position 1 correct  
   - L(✓) – position 2 correct  
   - E(✓) – position 3 correct  
   - V(x) – V not in the word (position 4)  
   - E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5 (which is already satisfied since E is in position 4)

   So the word structure is now:
   B L E E _

   The last letter must be a letter not yet ruled out and not appearing elsewhere.  
   Letters already used or ruled out: B, L, E, plus the excluded set above.  
   Remaining consonants: C, F, H, J, K, P, Q, X, Y, Z

   Looking for 5-letter words matching B L E E _:
   - BLEED – D is out  
   - BLEET – T is out  
   - BLEED – D is out  
   - BLECH – C and H are allowed, but word is BLECH? Not valid.  
   - BLEEK – K is allowed.  
   - BLEES – S is out.  
   - BLEET – T is out.  
   - BLEED – D is out.  

   The only valid word left is BLEEK (though it's uncommon).  
   Another candidate: BLEEP – P is allowed, but word is BLEEP.  
   BLEED is invalid (D out), BLEET invalid (T out), BLEES invalid (S out).

   Checking dictionary: ""BLEEK"" is valid (a variant spelling of ""bleed"" or a surname).  
   ""BLEEP"" is valid.  
   ""BLEED"" is invalid (D out).  

   Between BLEEK and BLEEP, both fit.  
   ""BLEEK"" uses K, ""BLEEP"" uses P.  
   Both are valid, but ""BLEEK"" is less common.  
   ""BLEEP"" is more likely.

   Let's choose BLEEP.
</think>

From the feedback:
- B, L, and E are locked in positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
- The fourth letter is E (confirmed by earlier feedback).
- The fifth letter must be a new consonant not yet tried and not in the excluded list.

The word must be **BLEE?** with the final letter from remaining consonants: C, F, H, J, K, P, Q, X, Y, Z.

Valid English words fitting **BLEE?**:
- BLEEP (P is allowed)
- BLEEK (K is allowed)

""BLEEP"" is more common, so we'll test it.

<guess>bleep</guess>",bleep,"Let's update what we now know from the five guesses:

1. Letters NOT in the word:  
   A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, D, W, G, M, V

2. Letters confirmed IN the word and their positions:  
   - B is in position 1 (✓)  
   - L is in position 2 (✓)  
   - E is in position 3 (✓)  
   - E is in position 4 (✓)  

   Wait a second – the feedback for “bleve” shows:
   - B(✓) – position 1 correct  
   - L(✓) – position 2 correct  
   - E(✓) – position 3 correct  
   - V(x) – position 4 wrong (but we already know E is in position 4 from earlier feedback)  
   - E(-) – position 5 wrong (but we already know E is in position 4)

   This seems contradictory. Let me re-read the feedback carefully:

   Guess 5: bleve  
   Feedback: B(✓) L(✓) E(✓) V(x) E(-)

   This means:
   - B is correct in position 1  
   - L is correct in position 2  
   - E is correct in position 3  
   - V is not in the word (position 4)  
   - E is in the word but not in position 5  

   But we already know from earlier guesses that:
   - E is in position 4 (from guess 3: bedew → E(✓) in position 4)

   This is a contradiction unless the feedback is interpreted as:
   - B(✓) – position 1 correct  
   - L(✓) – position 2 correct  
   - E(✓) – position 3 correct  
   - V(x) – V not in the word (position 4)  
   - E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5 (which is already satisfied since E is in position 4)

   B L E E _
