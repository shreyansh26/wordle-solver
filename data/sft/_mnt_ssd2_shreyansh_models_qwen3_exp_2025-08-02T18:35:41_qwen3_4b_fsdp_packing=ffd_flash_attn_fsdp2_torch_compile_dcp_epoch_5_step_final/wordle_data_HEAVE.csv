### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters that covers as many as possible without repeating any letters. ""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This will help me quickly identify which of these common letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently first).
- R, O, S are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and in the correct final position.

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains A somewhere, but not in position 1.
3. It does NOT contain R, O, or S.

Good letters to use next: A, E (already placed), plus other common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc. We want to test new letters while respecting the constraints.

A word like “TABLE” comes to mind:
- T, B, L are new letters.
- A is placed in position 2 (since position 1 is ruled out).
- E is confirmed in position 5.

This tests T, B, L while moving A to a new spot and keeping E fixed.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters that covers as many as possible without repeating any letters. ""AROSE"" is a strong choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This will help me quickly identify which of these common letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently first).
- R, O, S are not in the word at all.
- E is in the word and in the correct final position.

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains A somewhere, but not in position 1.
3. It does NOT contain R, O, or S.

Good letters to use next: A, E (already placed), plus other common consonants like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc. We want to test new letters while respecting the constraints.

A word like “TABLE” comes to mind:
- T, B, L are new letters.
- A is placed in position 2 (since position 1 is ruled out).
- E is confirmed in position 5.

This tests T, B, L while moving A to a new spot and keeping E fixed.

From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S are not in the word.

2. table → T(x) A(-) B(x) L(x) E(✓)
   - T, B, L are not in the word.
   - A is still in the word but not in position 2 (because it was marked “-” again).

So far:
- Letters we know are in the word: A, E (with E fixed at position 5).
- Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, O, S, T, B, L.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: N, D, C, M, P, G, H, I, U, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Contains A but not in positions 1 or 2.
- Uses only letters from the allowed set.

Possible positions for A: 3 or 4.

Let’s try a word that puts A in position 3 and introduces new common letters N, D, C, M, P, etc. A good candidate is “MADEN”:
- M, D, N are new letters.
- A is in position 3 (allowed).
- E is in position 5 (fixed).
- No disallowed letters are used.

From the new feedback on CHAFE:
- C and F are not in the word (x).
- H is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- A is in the word and now confirmed in position 3 (✓).
- E is confirmed in position 5 (✓).

So far we know:
- Positions: _ _ A _ E
- Letters in word: A (pos 3), E (pos 5), H (somewhere else)
- Letters not in word: R, O, S, T, B, L, M, D, N, C, F

Remaining common letters to test: G, I, K, P, U, Y, W, etc.

H must be in position 1 or 4 (since it can’t be in 2 or 3 or 5).

Let’s try H in position 1: H _ A _ E
Possible letters for position 2 and 4: from remaining allowed letters (G, I, K, P, U, Y, W, etc.)

A good candidate is “HAGUE”:
- H in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 3 (confirmed)
- G in position 2 (new letter)
- U in position 4 (new letter)
- E in position 5 (confirmed)

Check: H, A, G, U, E – all allowed letters, no conflicts.

From the feedback on HAGUE:

- H is now confirmed in position 1 (✓).
- A is still in the word but NOT in position 2 (it was marked “-” again).  
  (We already know A must be in position 3, so this is consistent.)
- G and U are NOT in the word (x).
- E is confirmed in position 5 (✓).

Current pattern:
H _ A _ E

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
R, O, S, T, B, L, M, D, N, C, F, G, U

Remaining common letters to test: I, K, P, Y, W, etc.

We need a letter for position 2 and position 4 from the remaining allowed set.

A good candidate is “HIAKE” (but K is allowed and E is already fixed).  
Wait, let’s pick “HIPEE” – no, that repeats E.

A valid word with allowed letters: H I A P E → “HIAPE” is not a word.  
Try “HIAKE” – not valid.  
Try “HIAPE” – not valid.  
Try “HIPAE” – not valid.  
Try “HIAKE” – not valid.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting H _ A _ E with allowed letters.

Possible letters left: I, K, P, Y, W, etc.

Valid word: H I A K E → “HIAKE” (not valid).  
Valid word: H I A P E → “HIAPE” (not valid).  
Valid word: H I A Y E → “HIAYE” (not valid).
