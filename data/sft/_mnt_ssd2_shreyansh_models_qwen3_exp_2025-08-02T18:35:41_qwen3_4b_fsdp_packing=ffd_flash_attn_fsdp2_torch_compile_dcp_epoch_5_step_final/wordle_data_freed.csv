### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps maximize the chance of getting hits (letters that are in the word) and can quickly narrow down possibilities.

Looking at common letters in English, some of the most frequent are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I want a word that uses several of these without repeating letters. ""AROSE"" is a good candidate because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common)
- O (common)
- S (common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives me five different letters, all of which are among the most frequent, which should provide good coverage for the first guess.

Current confirmed facts:

Remaining common letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, Y, K, V, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has R in position 2 and E in position 4
- Uses none of the excluded letters
- Uses new common letters in positions 1, 3, 5

Good candidates:
- B R E E D → but D is position 5, and we need to test new letters in 1,3,5

- P R E E D → D is position 5
- B R E E D → D is position 5
- H R E E D → D is position 5
- M R E E D → D is position 5

Actually, we need to test new letters in positions 1, 3, 5. Let's try:
- B R E E D → B (1), E (3 is already E, but position 3 is free) but E is already in 4, so position 3 could be another letter. Wait, no, position 3 is free, but we need to test new letters.

Wait, the pattern is _ R _ E _, so positions 1, 3, 5 are open. We have used:
- Position 1: A, I, C, D, F, G, H, M, P, B (all new)
- Position 3: none tested yet (except U, which is excluded)
- Position 5: none tested yet (except L, which is excluded)

Let's try a word that tests new letters in 1, 3, 5:
- B R E E D → B (1), E (3), D (5) → but E is already in 4, so position 3 could be E, but that would repeat E which is allowed? Wait, no, the word can have multiple E's, but we don't know if E is only in position 4. However, we have no info that E is only in position 4, so this is possible.

But let's think of words that fit _ R _ E _ with new letters:
- B R E E D → B, R, E, E, D → but we have no info on B or D yet
- F R E E D → F, R, E, E, D
- G R E E D → G, R, E, E, D
- P R E E D → P, R, E, E, D

Actually, these all test D in position 5. Let's try a word that tests a new letter in position 5, and maybe position 3:
- B R E E D → tests B (1), E (3), D (5)
- F R E E D → tests F (1), E (3), D (5)
- G R E E D → tests G (1), E (3), D (5)

But position 3 is already E in these words, which might not be helpful. Let's try a word where position 3 is a new letter:
- B R I E D → but I is excluded
- B R A E D → A is excluded
- B R O E D → O is excluded
- B R U E D → U is excluded
- B R Y E D → Y is new, D is new
- B R E E D → as above

Actually, the only new letters left are: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, Y, K, V, W, etc.

Let's try B R E E D:
- B (1) - new
- R (2) - confirmed
- E (3) - possible, but we don't know if E is only in 4
- E (4) - confirmed
- D (5) - new

This seems like a good test of B and D, and it's a valid word.

Alternatively, let's try F R E E D:
- F (1) - new
- R (2) - confirmed
- E (3) - possible
- E (4) - confirmed
- D (5) - new

Either would work, but B R E E D uses B which is common.

So I'll go with B R E E D.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. This helps maximize the chance of getting hits (letters that are in the word) and can quickly narrow down possibilities.

Looking at common letters in English, some of the most frequent are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I want a word that uses several of these without repeating letters. ""AROSE"" is a good candidate because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common)
- O (common)
- S (common)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This gives me five different letters, all of which are among the most frequent, which should provide good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is in the word and is in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
- Contains E somewhere, but not in position 5.
- Does not contain A, O, or S.

Letters still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus E somewhere).

We need a word that:
1. Has R in position 2.
2. Contains E somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 4).
3. Does not contain A, O, or S.

A good next guess should test new common letters while satisfying these constraints. Let’s try “inter”:
- I, N, T, E, R.
- R is in position 2 (✓).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since it’s not position 5).
- Does not contain A, O, or S.

This tests I, N, T (all common) and keeps R in place while moving E to a new position.

2. Test new common letters in the remaining positions (1, 3, 5).
3. Avoid all excluded letters.

Wait, no, position 3 is free, but we need to test new letters.\n\nWait, the pattern is _ R _ E _, so positions 1, 3, 5 are open. We have used:\n- Position 1: A, I, C, D, F, G, H, M, P, B (all new)\n- Position 3: none tested yet (except U, which is excluded)\n- Position 5: none tested yet (except L, which is excluded)\n\nLet's try a word that tests new letters in 1, 3, 5:\n- B R E E D → B (1), E (3), D (5) → but E is already in 4, so position 3 could be E, but that would repeat E which is allowed? Wait, no, the word can have multiple E's, but we don't know if E is only in position 4. However, we have no info that E is only in position 4, so this is possible.\n\nBut let's think of words that fit _ R _ E _ with new letters:\n- B R E E D → B, R, E, E, D → but we have no info on B or D yet\n- F R E E D → F, R, E, E, D\n- G R E E D → G, R, E, E, D\n- P R E E D → P, R, E, E, D\n\nActually, these all test D in position 5. Let's try a word that tests a new letter in position 5, and maybe position 3:\n- B R E E D → tests B (1), E (3), D (5)\n- F R E E D → tests F (1), E (3), D (5)\n- G R E E D → tests G (1), E (3), D (5)\n\nBut position 3 is already E in these words, which might not be helpful. Let's try a word where position 3 is a new letter:\n- B R I E D → but I is excluded\n- B R A E D → A is excluded\n- B R O E D → O is excluded\n- B R U E D → U is excluded\n- B R Y E D → Y is new, D is new\n- B R E E D → as above\n\nActually, the only new letters left are: B, D, F, G, H, M, P, Y, K, V, W, etc.\n\nLet's try B R E E D:\n- B (1) - new\n- R (2) - confirmed\n- E (3) - possible, but we don't know if E is only in 4\n- E (4) - confirmed\n- D (5) - new\n\nThis seems like a good test of B and D, and it's a valid word.\n\nAlternatively, let's try F R E E D:\n- F (1) - new\n- R (2) - confirmed\n- E (3) - possible\n- E (4) - confirmed\n- D (5) - new\n\nEither would work, but B R E E D uses B which is common.\n\nSo I'll go with B R E E D.\n\n<guess>breed</guess>""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: inter -> FEEDBACK: I(x) N(x) T(x) E(✓) R(-)\nGuess 3: cruel -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) U(x) E(✓) L(x)\nGuess 4: breed -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) E(✓) E(✓) D(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From the latest feedback on “breed”:
- B(x) → B is not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is in position 2 (confirmed).
- E(✓) → E is in position 3 (new info).
- E(✓) → E is in position 4 (confirmed).
- D(✓) → D is in position 5 (confirmed).

So the pattern is now: _ R E E D.

Letters confirmed in the word:
- R (position 2)
- E (positions 3 and 4)
- D (position 5)

Letters NOT in the word:
A, O, S, I, N, T, C, U, L, B

We still need a valid 5-letter word that fits the pattern _ R E E D. The only common English word that fits is “FREED” (F, R, E, E, D). Let’s check:
- F is not yet tested and is a common letter.
- R, E, E, D are all confirmed in their positions.

Therefore, the next guess should be FREED.
