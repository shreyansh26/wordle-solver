For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess should cover as many of these as possible. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 4 vowels (A, O, E) and the common consonant R, S. This gives us good coverage of high-frequency letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities early on.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, T, A, E. Both are strong choices, but ""AROSE"" has slightly better letter frequency coverage according to some analyses. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word, but not in position 1.
- R(-): R is in the word, but not in position 2.
- O(x), S(x), E(x): O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R, but not O, S, E.
- A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2.

Good next step: pick a word that:
1. Uses A and R in different positions.
2. Avoids O, S, E.
3. Introduces other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Possible candidates:
- TRAIN (but has S, which is out)
- CRANK (has S, out)
- DRAIN (has S, out)
- GRAIN (has S, out)
- TRAMP (has S, out)
- FRANK (has S, out)
- PRANK (has S, out)
- BRAND (has S, out)

Looking for words without O, S, E and with A and R:
- TRAIN → has S (invalid)
- CRANK → has S (invalid)
- RATIO → has O (invalid)
- ARIAS → has S (invalid)
- RAPID → doesn't have A (invalid)
- DRIP → too short
- PRADA → has S (invalid)
- RADAR → has A and R, but S is out (it's fine), positions: A is in 2 and 4, R is in 1 and 3. This seems good because it tests A in positions 2 and 4, R in 1 and 3, and introduces D and P.

Another candidate: RAPID → lacks A.
Another: CRATE → has E (invalid).
Another: GRANT → has S (invalid).
Another: TRAMP → has P and M, but let's see: T, R, A, M, P. This has A and R, no O/S/E, and positions: A is in 3, R in 2. But R is in position 2 which was marked as wrong for R, so this is bad.

So RADAR seems better because:
- Contains A (positions 2 and 4) and R (positions 1 and 3).
- Avoids O, S, E.
- Introduces D and P.

Therefore, I'll go with RADAR.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: AROSE  
A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
→ A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.  
→ Letters O, S, E are not in the word.

Round 2: RADAR  
R(-) A(-) D(x) A(✓) R(✓)  
→ A is in the word and is in position 4 (✓).  
→ R is in the word and is in position 5 (✓).  
→ D is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Word ends in “R” (position 5 = R).  
- Position 4 = A.  
- Letters already ruled out: O, S, E, D.

We still need to determine positions 1, 2, and 3.  
We know A and R are present, and we now know their exact positions (A at 4, R at 5).  
We need three more letters, none of which can be O, S, E, D.

Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, G, B, F, H, etc.  
We want a word that:
- Has A in position 4.  
- Has R in position 5.  
- Avoids O, S, E, D.  
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible patterns: _ _ _ A R

Let’s brainstorm:
- C H A R _ → but we need 5 letters ending in AR.  
- B A R _ _ → but we need A in position 4 and R in 5.  
- F A C _ R → FAC_R → FACER (but E is out).  
- T A C _ R → TAC_R → TACKR (invalid).  
- C A R _ R → CAR_R → CARTR (invalid).  
- G A R _ R → GAR_R → GARTR (invalid).  
- B A R _ R → BAR_R → BARTR (invalid).  
- P A R _ R → PAR_R → PARTR (invalid).  
- L A R _ R → LAR_R → LARTR (invalid).  
- F A L _ R → FAL_R → FALUR (invalid).  
- C A L _ R → CAL_R → CALOR (but O is out).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANER (E is out).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANGR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANKR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANOR (O is out).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANPR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANCR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANFR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANGR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANHR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANJR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANKR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANLR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANMR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANNR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANNR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANPR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANQR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANRR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANSR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANTR → CANTR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANVR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANWR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANXR (invalid).  

Hmm, let’s think differently. We need a 5-letter word ending in “AR” with A in position 4 and R in position 5.  
So the pattern is: _ _ _ A R.

Looking at common English words ending in “AR”:
- BARK → but we need 5 letters.  
- CAR → too short.  
- TAR → too short.  
- PAR → too short.  
- FARM → ends in M.  
- HARE → ends in E (invalid).  
- LAR → too short.  
- MARE → ends in E (invalid).  
- PEAR → ends in E (invalid).  
- SHARE → ends in E (invalid).  
- FURAR → invalid.  
- CUBAR → ends in AR.  
- DUBAR → invalid (D is out).  
- GUBAR → invalid.  
- HUBAR → invalid.  
- JUBAR → invalid.  
- LUBAR → invalid.  
- MUBAR → invalid.  
- PUBAR → invalid.  
- SABAR → S is out.  
- TUBAR → invalid.  
- VUBAR → invalid.  
- XUBAR → invalid.  
- YUBAR → invalid.  
- ZUBAR → invalid.  

Wait, let’s list actual 5-letter words ending in “AR”:
- BARK → 4 letters.  
- CAR → 3 letters.  
- FARM → ends in M.  
- HARE → ends in E.  
- LARE → ends in E.  
- MARE → ends in E.  
- PARE → ends in E.

<guess>CUBAR</guess>",CUBAR,"From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: AROSE  
A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
→ A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.  
→ Letters O, S, E are not in the word.

Round 2: RADAR  
R(-) A(-) D(x) A(✓) R(✓)  
→ A is in the word and is in position 4 (✓).  
→ R is in the word and is in position 5 (✓).  
→ D is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Word ends in “R” (position 5 = R).  
- Position 4 = A.  
- Letters already ruled out: O, S, E, D.

We still need to determine positions 1, 2, and 3.  
We know A and R are present, and we now know their exact positions (A at 4, R at 5).  
We need three more letters, none of which can be O, S, E, D.

Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, G, B, F, H, etc.  
We want a word that:
- Has A in position 4.  
- Has R in position 5.  
- Avoids O, S, E, D.  
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible patterns: _ _ _ A R

Let’s brainstorm:
- C H A R _ → but we need 5 letters ending in AR.  
- B A R _ _ → but we need A in position 4 and R in 5.

Hmm, let’s think differently. We need a 5-letter word ending in “AR” with A in position 4 and R in position 5.  
So the pattern is: _ _ _ A R.

Looking at common English words ending in “AR”:
- BARK → but we need 5 letters.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess should cover as many of these as possible. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 4 vowels (A, O, E) and the common consonant R, S. This gives us good coverage of high-frequency letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities early on.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, T, A, E. Both are strong choices, but ""AROSE"" has slightly better letter frequency coverage according to some analyses. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word, but not in position 1.
- R(-): R is in the word, but not in position 2.
- O(x), S(x), E(x): O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R, but not O, S, E.
- A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2.

Good next step: pick a word that:
1. Uses A and R in different positions.
2. Avoids O, S, E.
3. Introduces other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Possible candidates:
- TRAIN (but has S, which is out)
- CRANK (has S, out)
- DRAIN (has S, out)
- GRAIN (has S, out)
- TRAMP (has S, out)
- FRANK (has S, out)
- PRANK (has S, out)
- BRAND (has S, out)

Looking for words without O, S, E and with A and R:
- TRAIN → has S (invalid)
- CRANK → has S (invalid)
- RATIO → has O (invalid)
- ARIAS → has S (invalid)
- RAPID → doesn't have A (invalid)
- DRIP → too short
- PRADA → has S (invalid)
- RADAR → has A and R, but S is out (it's fine), positions: A is in 2 and 4, R is in 1 and 3. This seems good because it tests A in positions 2 and 4, R in 1 and 3, and introduces D and P.

Another candidate: RAPID → lacks A.
Another: CRATE → has E (invalid).
Another: GRANT → has S (invalid).
Another: TRAMP → has P and M, but let's see: T, R, A, M, P. This has A and R, no O/S/E, and positions: A is in 3, R in 2. But R is in position 2 which was marked as wrong for R, so this is bad.

So RADAR seems better because:
- Contains A (positions 2 and 4) and R (positions 1 and 3).
- Avoids O, S, E.
- Introduces D and P.

Therefore, I'll go with RADAR.

Looking at remaining consonants: T, N, L, G, H, M, P, F, Y, K, V, W, etc.

Possible combinations:
- T N I A R → TNIAR → invalid
- T N A R ? → TNA_R → TNA_R doesn’t form a valid word.
- T I N A R → TINAR → TINAR is a valid word (a unit of currency, but is it accepted in Wordle?).
- T I N A R → TINAR is 5 letters ending in AR, with A in position 4 and R in 5, and no ruled-out letters.

TINAR:
- T I N A R → positions: T(1), I(2), N(3), A(4), R(5)
- Letters: T, I, N, A, R
- No O, S, E, D, U, B
- A and R are correctly placed

This seems valid. Let’s check if TINAR is a recognized word: Yes, it’s the TINAR (or TINAR) which is the currency unit of Syria.

Another possibility: F I A R ? → FIAR_ → FIAR_ doesn’t form a word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess should cover as many of these as possible. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 4 vowels (A, O, E) and the common consonant R, S. This gives us good coverage of high-frequency letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities early on.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, T, A, E. Both are strong choices, but ""AROSE"" has slightly better letter frequency coverage according to some analyses. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word, but not in position 1.
- R(-): R is in the word, but not in position 2.
- O(x), S(x), E(x): O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R, but not O, S, E.
- A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2.

Good next step: pick a word that:
1. Uses A and R in different positions.
2. Avoids O, S, E.
3. Introduces other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Possible candidates:
- TRAIN (but has S, which is out)
- CRANK (has S, out)
- DRAIN (has S, out)
- GRAIN (has S, out)
- TRAMP (has S, out)
- FRANK (has S, out)
- PRANK (has S, out)
- BRAND (has S, out)

Looking for words without O, S, E and with A and R:
- TRAIN → has S (invalid)
- CRANK → has S (invalid)
- RATIO → has O (invalid)
- ARIAS → has S (invalid)
- RAPID → doesn't have A (invalid)
- DRIP → too short
- PRADA → has S (invalid)
- RADAR → has A and R, but S is out (it's fine), positions: A is in 2 and 4, R is in 1 and 3. This seems good because it tests A in positions 2 and 4, R in 1 and 3, and introduces D and P.

Another candidate: RAPID → lacks A.
Another: CRATE → has E (invalid).
Another: GRANT → has S (invalid).
Another: TRAMP → has P and M, but let's see: T, R, A, M, P. This has A and R, no O/S/E, and positions: A is in 3, R in 2. But R is in position 2 which was marked as wrong for R, so this is bad.

So RADAR seems better because:
- Contains A (positions 2 and 4) and R (positions 1 and 3).
- Avoids O, S, E.
- Introduces D and P.

Therefore, I'll go with RADAR.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: AROSE  
A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
→ A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.  
→ Letters O, S, E are not in the word.

Round 2: RADAR  
R(-) A(-) D(x) A(✓) R(✓)  
→ A is in the word and is in position 4 (✓).  
→ R is in the word and is in position 5 (✓).  
→ D is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Word ends in “R” (position 5 = R).  
- Position 4 = A.  
- Letters already ruled out: O, S, E, D.

We still need to determine positions 1, 2, and 3.  
We know A and R are present, and we now know their exact positions (A at 4, R at 5).  
We need three more letters, none of which can be O, S, E, D.

Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, G, B, F, H, etc.  
We want a word that:
- Has A in position 4.  
- Has R in position 5.  
- Avoids O, S, E, D.  
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible patterns: _ _ _ A R

Hmm, let’s think differently. We need a 5-letter word ending in “AR” with A in position 4 and R in position 5.  
So the pattern is: _ _ _ A R.

From these, the valid ones are:
- CUBAR  
- FUBAR  

Both fit the constraints:
- CUBAR: letters C, U, B, A, R.  
  - A is in position 4 (✓).  
  - R is in position 5 (✓).  
  - No O, S, E, D.  
- FUBAR: letters F, U, B, A, R.  
  - Same positions and letters.  

Between these, CUBAR uses C, U, B while FUBAR uses F, U, B.  
Both are equally valid. I’ll choose CUBAR as it introduces C and U.

From all feedback so far:

Known positions:
- Position 4 = A
- Position 5 = R

Letters confirmed in the word but not yet placed:
- A (already in position 4)
- R (already in position 5)

Letters ruled out entirely:
- O, S, E, D, U, B

Letters still possible for positions 1, 2, 3:
- Common consonants not yet used: T, N, L, G, H, M, P, F, Y, K, V, W, etc.
- Vowels left: I (A is already placed)

We need a 5-letter word ending in ""AR"" with A in position 4 and R in position 5, and no O, S, E, D, U, B.

Possible patterns: _ _ _ A R

Looking for common words fitting this:
- F I A R ? → FIAR_ → FIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- T I A R ? → TIAR_ → TIARA (but that’s 5 letters ending in AR).
- T I A R ? → TIAR_ → TIARA is 5 letters ending in AR.
- P I A R ? → PIAR_ → PIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- G I A R ? → GIAR_ → GIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- H I A R ? → HIAR_ → HIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- M I A R ? → MIAR_ → MIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- V I A R ? → VIAR_ → VIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- W I A R ? → WIAR_ → WIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- Y I A R ? → YIAR_ → YIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- K I A R ? → KIAR_ → KIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- N I A R ? → NIAR_ → NIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- L I A R ? → LIAR_ → LIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- T I A R ? → TIAR_ → TIARA is valid.

TIARA:
- T I A R A → but we need _ _ _ A R, not ending in A.
Oops, TIARA ends in A, not AR. Let me rethink.

Valid 5-letter words ending in AR:
- TIARA → ends in A, not AR.
- FIARA → invalid (not a word).
- MIARA → invalid.
- PIARA → invalid.
- TIARA → invalid (ends in A).
- VIARA → invalid.
- W I A R ? → WIAR_ → WIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- Y I A R ? → YIAR_ → YIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- K I A R ? → KIAR_ → KIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- N I A R ? → NIAR_ → NIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- L I A R ? → LIAR_ → LIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- T I A R ? → TIAR_ → TIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- F I A R ? → FIAR_ → FIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.

Wait, let’s list actual 5-letter words ending in AR:
- CUBAR → already tried (C out)
- FUBAR → already tried (F, U, B)
- TUBAR → invalid (U, B)
- HUBAR → invalid (U, B)
- MUBAR → invalid (U, B)
- PUBAR → invalid (U, B)
- SABAR → S out
- VUBAR → invalid (U, B)
- WUBAR → invalid (U, B)
- YUBAR → invalid (U, B)
- ZUBAR → invalid (U, B)

Looking at remaining consonants: T, N, L, G, H, M, P, F, Y, K, V, W, etc.

Possible combinations:
- T N I A R → TNIAR → invalid
- T N A R ? → TNA_R → TNA_R doesn’t form a valid word.
- T I N A R → TINAR → TINAR is a valid word (a unit of currency, but is it accepted in Wordle?).
- T I N A R → TINAR is 5 letters ending in AR, with A in position 4 and R in 5, and no ruled-out letters.

TINAR:
- T I N A R → positions: T(1), I(2), N(3), A(4), R(5)
- Letters: T, I, N, A, R
- No O, S, E, D, U, B
- A and R are correctly placed

This seems valid. Let’s check if TINAR is a recognized word: Yes, it’s the TINAR (or TINAR) which is the currency unit of Syria.

Another possibility: F I A R ? → FIAR_ → FIAR_ doesn’t form a word.
- F I A R ? → FIAR_ → FIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- F I N A R → F I N A R → FINAR → invalid.
- F I V A R → FIVAR → invalid.
- F I G A R → FIGAR → invalid.
- F I L A R → FILAR → invalid.
- F I M A R → FIMAR → invalid.
- F I P A R → FIPAR → invalid.
- F I V A R → FIVAR → invalid.
- F I Y A R → FIYAR → invalid.

Similarly for other consonants, no valid words found. TINAR seems the only valid candidate.

Therefore, the next guess is TINAR.

This gives us good coverage of high-frequency letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities early on.\n\nAnother good option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, T, A, E.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good first guess should cover as many of these as possible. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 4 vowels (A, O, E) and the common consonant R, S. This gives us good coverage of high-frequency letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities early on.

Another good option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, T, A, E. Both are strong choices, but ""AROSE"" has slightly better letter frequency coverage according to some analyses. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word, but not in position 1.
- R(-): R is in the word, but not in position 2.
- O(x), S(x), E(x): O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R, but not O, S, E.
- A is not in position 1, R is not in position 2.

Good next step: pick a word that:
1. Uses A and R in different positions.
2. Avoids O, S, E.
3. Introduces other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Possible candidates:
- TRAIN (but has S, which is out)
- CRANK (has S, out)
- DRAIN (has S, out)
- GRAIN (has S, out)
- TRAMP (has S, out)
- FRANK (has S, out)
- PRANK (has S, out)
- BRAND (has S, out)

Looking for words without O, S, E and with A and R:
- TRAIN → has S (invalid)
- CRANK → has S (invalid)
- RATIO → has O (invalid)
- ARIAS → has S (invalid)
- RAPID → doesn't have A (invalid)
- DRIP → too short
- PRADA → has S (invalid)
- RADAR → has A and R, but S is out (it's fine), positions: A is in 2 and 4, R is in 1 and 3. This seems good because it tests A in positions 2 and 4, R in 1 and 3, and introduces D and P.

Another candidate: RAPID → lacks A.
Another: CRATE → has E (invalid).
Another: GRANT → has S (invalid).
Another: TRAMP → has P and M, but let's see: T, R, A, M, P. This has A and R, no O/S/E, and positions: A is in 3, R in 2. But R is in position 2 which was marked as wrong for R, so this is bad.

So RADAR seems better because:
- Contains A (positions 2 and 4) and R (positions 1 and 3).
- Avoids O, S, E.
- Introduces D and P.

Therefore, I'll go with RADAR.

Guess 2: RADAR -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) D(x) A(✓) R(✓)

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: AROSE  
A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
→ A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.  
→ Letters O, S, E are not in the word.

Round 2: RADAR  
R(-) A(-) D(x) A(✓) R(✓)  
→ A is in the word and is in position 4 (✓).  
→ R is in the word and is in position 5 (✓).  
→ D is not in the word.

So we now know:
- Word ends in “R” (position 5 = R).  
- Position 4 = A.  
- Letters already ruled out: O, S, E, D.

We still need to determine positions 1, 2, and 3.  
We know A and R are present, and we now know their exact positions (A at 4, R at 5).  
We need three more letters, none of which can be O, S, E, D.

Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, G, B, F, H, etc.  
We want a word that:
- Has A in position 4.  
- Has R in position 5.  
- Avoids O, S, E, D.  
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible patterns: _ _ _ A R

Let’s brainstorm:
- C H A R _ → but we need 5 letters ending in AR.  
- B A R _ _ → but we need A in position 4 and R in 5.  
- F A C _ R → FAC_R → FACER (but E is out).  
- T A C _ R → TAC_R → TACKR (invalid).  
- C A R _ R → CAR_R → CARTR (invalid).  
- G A R _ R → GAR_R → GARTR (invalid).  
- B A R _ R → BAR_R → BARTR (invalid).  
- P A R _ R → PAR_R → PARTR (invalid).  
- L A R _ R → LAR_R → LARTR (invalid).  
- F A L _ R → FAL_R → FALUR (invalid).  
- C A L _ R → CAL_R → CALOR (but O is out).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANER (E is out).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANGR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANKR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANOR (O is out).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANPR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANCR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANFR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANGR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANHR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANJR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANKR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANLR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANMR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANNR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANNR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANPR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANQR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANRR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANSR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANTR → CANTR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANVR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANWR (invalid).  
- C A N _ R → CAN_R → CANXR (invalid).  

Hmm, let’s think differently. We need a 5-letter word ending in “AR” with A in position 4 and R in position 5.  
So the pattern is: _ _ _ A R.

Looking at common English words ending in “AR”:
- BARK → but we need 5 letters.  
- CAR → too short.  
- TAR → too short.  
- PAR → too short.  
- FARM → ends in M.  
- HARE → ends in E (invalid).  
- LAR → too short.  
- MARE → ends in E (invalid).  
- PEAR → ends in E (invalid).  
- SHARE → ends in E (invalid).  
- FURAR → invalid.  
- CUBAR → ends in AR.  
- DUBAR → invalid (D is out).  
- GUBAR → invalid.  
- HUBAR → invalid.  
- JUBAR → invalid.  
- LUBAR → invalid.  
- MUBAR → invalid.  
- PUBAR → invalid.  
- SABAR → S is out.  
- TUBAR → invalid.  
- VUBAR → invalid.  
- XUBAR → invalid.  
- YUBAR → invalid.  
- ZUBAR → invalid.  

Wait, let’s list actual 5-letter words ending in “AR”:
- BARK → 4 letters.  
- CAR → 3 letters.  
- FARM → ends in M.  
- HARE → ends in E.  
- LARE → ends in E.  
- MARE → ends in E.  
- PARE → ends in E.  
- TARE → ends in E.  
- VARE → ends in E.  
- WARE → ends in E.  
- YARE → ends in E.  
- ZARE → ends in E.  
- CUBAR → ends in AR.  
- DUBAR → invalid (D is out).  
- FUBAR → ends in AR.  
- GUBAR → invalid.  
- HUBAR → invalid.  
- JUBAR → invalid.  
- LUBAR → invalid.  
- MUBAR → invalid.  
- PUBAR → invalid.  
- SABAR → S is out.  
- TUBAR → invalid.  
- VUBAR → invalid.  
- XUBAR → invalid.  
- YUBAR → invalid.  
- ZUBAR → invalid.  

From these, the valid ones are:
- CUBAR  
- FUBAR  

Both fit the constraints:
- CUBAR: letters C, U, B, A, R.  
  - A is in position 4 (✓).  
  - R is in position 5 (✓).  
  - No O, S, E, D.  
- FUBAR: letters F, U, B, A, R.  
  - Same positions and letters.  

Between these, CUBAR uses C, U, B while FUBAR uses F, U, B.  
Both are equally valid. I’ll choose CUBAR as it introduces C and U.

From all feedback so far:

Known positions:
- Position 4 = A
- Position 5 = R

Letters confirmed in the word but not yet placed:
- A (already in position 4)
- R (already in position 5)

Letters ruled out entirely:
- O, S, E, D, U, B

Letters still possible for positions 1, 2, 3:
- Common consonants not yet used: T, N, L, G, H, M, P, F, Y, K, V, W, etc.
- Vowels left: I (A is already placed)

We need a 5-letter word ending in ""AR"" with A in position 4 and R in position 5, and no O, S, E, D, U, B.

Possible patterns: _ _ _ A R

Looking for common words fitting this:
- F I A R ? → FIAR_ → FIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- T I A R ? → TIAR_ → TIARA (but that’s 5 letters ending in AR).
- T I A R ? → TIAR_ → TIARA is 5 letters ending in AR.
- P I A R ? → PIAR_ → PIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- G I A R ? → GIAR_ → GIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- H I A R ? → HIAR_ → HIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- M I A R ? → MIAR_ → MIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- V I A R ? → VIAR_ → VIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- W I A R ? → WIAR_ → WIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- Y I A R ? → YIAR_ → YIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- K I A R ? → KIAR_ → KIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- N I A R ? → NIAR_ → NIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- L I A R ? → LIAR_ → LIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- T I A R ? → TIAR_ → TIARA is valid.

TIARA:
- T I A R A → but we need _ _ _ A R, not ending in A.
Oops, TIARA ends in A, not AR. Let me rethink.

Valid 5-letter words ending in AR:
- TIARA → ends in A, not AR.
- FIARA → invalid (not a word).
- MIARA → invalid.
- PIARA → invalid.
- TIARA → invalid (ends in A).
- VIARA → invalid.
- W I A R ? → WIAR_ → WIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- Y I A R ? → YIAR_ → YIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- K I A R ? → KIAR_ → KIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- N I A R ? → NIAR_ → NIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- L I A R ? → LIAR_ → LIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- T I A R ? → TIAR_ → TIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- F I A R ? → FIAR_ → FIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.

Wait, let’s list actual 5-letter words ending in AR:
- CUBAR → already tried (C out)
- FUBAR → already tried (F, U, B)
- TUBAR → invalid (U, B)
- HUBAR → invalid (U, B)
- MUBAR → invalid (U, B)
- PUBAR → invalid (U, B)
- SABAR → S out
- VUBAR → invalid (U, B)
- WUBAR → invalid (U, B)
- YUBAR → invalid (U, B)
- ZUBAR → invalid (U, B)

Looking at remaining consonants: T, N, L, G, H, M, P, F, Y, K, V, W, etc.

Possible combinations:
- T N I A R → TNIAR → invalid
- T N A R ? → TNA_R → TNA_R doesn’t form a valid word.
- T I N A R → TINAR → TINAR is a valid word (a unit of currency, but is it accepted in Wordle?).
- T I N A R → TINAR is 5 letters ending in AR, with A in position 4 and R in 5, and no ruled-out letters.

TINAR:
- T I N A R → positions: T(1), I(2), N(3), A(4), R(5)
- Letters: T, I, N, A, R
- No O, S, E, D, U, B
- A and R are correctly placed

This seems valid. Let’s check if TINAR is a recognized word: Yes, it’s the TINAR (or TINAR) which is the currency unit of Syria.

Another possibility: F I A R ? → FIAR_ → FIAR_ doesn’t form a word.
- F I A R ? → FIAR_ → FIAR_ doesn’t form a valid word.
- F I N A R → F I N A R → FINAR → invalid.
- F I V A R → FIVAR → invalid.
- F I G A R → FIGAR → invalid.
- F I L A R → FILAR → invalid.
- F I M A R → FIMAR → invalid.
- F I P A R → FIPAR → invalid.
- F I V A R → FIVAR → invalid.
- F I Y A R → FIYAR → invalid.

Similarly for other consonants, no valid words found. TINAR seems the only valid candidate.

Therefore, the next guess is TINAR.

From the latest feedback on HILAR:

- Position 2 = I (✓)  – confirmed
- Position 4 = A (✓)  – confirmed
- Position 5 = R (✓)  – confirmed
- Letters ruled out so far: O, S, E, D, U, B, T, N, H, L

So the pattern is: _ I _ A R

Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 3:
- Position 1: cannot be A, R, I, O, S, E, D, U, B, T, N, H
  Remaining consonants: F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Y
- Position 3: same list, but must form a valid word

Looking at all these, none seem valid. However, the word ""F I G A R"" is actually ""FIGAR"" which is not valid. The only valid word left is ""K I G A R"" which is invalid. 

Wait, let's think differently - maybe position 3 can be a vowel? But we've already used I and A. The only other vowel is Y (sometimes), but Y is not a vowel here.

Actually, the word ""K I G A R"" is invalid. The word ""M I G A R"" is invalid.
