For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- A: very common starting letter
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: very common letter
- E: the most common vowel in English

This combination gives me a good chance to identify multiple letters in the secret word right away.

- R is not in the word.

   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (because it showed up in position 3 with ✓, but that contradicts the first feedback that A is not in position 1). Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.

Actually, the feedback for plate is:
P(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)

This means:
- L is in position 2 and is correct.
- A is in the word and is in position 3 (because it got ✓).
- E is in position 5 and is correct.
- P and T are not in the word.

But this contradicts the first feedback where A was marked (-) meaning it's in the word but not in position 1. Now it's showing ✓ for position 3, so A is indeed in position 3. So the secret word has:
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: A
- Position 5: E

And it does not contain P, T, R, O, S.

So the word structure is: _ L A _ E

Possible letters for positions 1 and 4: any letters except P, T, R, O, S.

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting _ L A _ E:
- BLADE (B, L, A, D, E) - but D is allowed.
- CLAVE (C, L, A, V, E) - but V is allowed.
- FLAKE (F, L, A, K, E) - but K is allowed.
- GLADE (G, L, A, D, E) - D is allowed.
- SLATE (S is excluded, so no)
- PLATE (P is excluded, so no)

BLADE and CLAVE are good candidates. Between them, BLADE uses B and D which are common and haven't been tested yet. Let's try BLADE.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 1).
- R is not in the word.
- O is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (currently position 5).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains A (not in position 1).
3. Does not contain R, O, or S.

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. Some possibilities:
- LATE? No, ends with E but A is in position 2 (allowed), but we need to check other letters.
- PLATE? Also ends with E, has A in position 2, but has S? No, PLATE has P, L, A, T, E - no S, R, or O.

- VAPOR? Ends with R, which is invalid (R is not in the word).
- LANCE? Ends with E, has A in position 2, and no R, O, S.

I think ""PLATE"" is a good choice because:
- Ends with E.
- Has A in position 2 (allowed).
- Does not contain R, O, or S.
- Uses common letters P, L, T to gather more information.

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting _ L A _ E:
- BLADE (B, L, A, D, E) - but D is allowed.
- CLAVE (C, L, A, V, E) - but V is allowed.
- FLAKE (F, L, A, K, E) - but K is allowed.
- GLADE (G, L, A, D, E) - D is allowed.
- SLATE (S is excluded, so no)
- PLATE (P is excluded, so no)

BLADE and CLAVE are good candidates. Between them, BLADE uses B and D which are common and haven't been tested yet. Let's try BLADE.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- A: very common starting letter
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: very common letter
- E: the most common vowel in English

This combination gives me a good chance to identify multiple letters in the secret word right away.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 1).
- R is not in the word.
- O is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (currently position 5).

So the secret word ends with E and contains an A somewhere other than position 1. We also know it does not contain R, O, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains A (not in position 1).
3. Does not contain R, O, or S.

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. Some possibilities:
- LATE? No, ends with E but A is in position 2 (allowed), but we need to check other letters.
- PLATE? Also ends with E, has A in position 2, but has S? No, PLATE has P, L, A, T, E - no S, R, or O.
- GLADE? G, L, A, D, E - no S, R, or O, and A is in position 3 (allowed).
- MAIZE? Ends with E, has A in position 2, but has Z and I - but Z is less common, but allowed.
- VAPOR? Ends with R, which is invalid (R is not in the word).
- LANCE? Ends with E, has A in position 2, and no R, O, S.

I think ""PLATE"" is a good choice because:
- Ends with E.
- Has A in position 2 (allowed).
- Does not contain R, O, or S.
- Uses common letters P, L, T to gather more information.

From the two guesses so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in position 5.
   - R, O, S are not in the word.

2. plate → P(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
   - L is in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (because it showed up in position 3 with ✓, but that contradicts the first feedback that A is not in position 1). Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.

Actually, the feedback for plate is:
P(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)

This means:
- L is in position 2 and is correct.
- A is in the word and is in position 3 (because it got ✓).
- E is in position 5 and is correct.
- P and T are not in the word.

But this contradicts the first feedback where A was marked (-) meaning it's in the word but not in position 1. Now it's showing ✓ for position 3, so A is indeed in position 3. So the secret word has:
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: A
- Position 5: E

And it does not contain P, T, R, O, S.

So the word structure is: _ L A _ E

Possible letters for positions 1 and 4: any letters except P, T, R, O, S.

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting _ L A _ E:
- BLADE (B, L, A, D, E) - but D is allowed.
- CLAVE (C, L, A, V, E) - but V is allowed.
- FLAKE (F, L, A, K, E) - but K is allowed.
- GLADE (G, L, A, D, E) - D is allowed.
- SLATE (S is excluded, so no)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- A: very common starting letter
- R: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- S: very common letter
- E: the most common vowel in English

This combination gives me a good chance to identify multiple letters in the secret word right away.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 1).
- R is not in the word.
- O is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.
- E is in the word and in the correct position (currently position 5).

So the secret word ends with E and contains an A somewhere other than position 1. We also know it does not contain R, O, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Contains A (not in position 1).
3. Does not contain R, O, or S.

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. Some possibilities:
- LATE? No, ends with E but A is in position 2 (allowed), but we need to check other letters.
- PLATE? Also ends with E, has A in position 2, but has S? No, PLATE has P, L, A, T, E - no S, R, or O.
- GLADE? G, L, A, D, E - no S, R, or O, and A is in position 3 (allowed).
- MAIZE? Ends with E, has A in position 2, but has Z and I - but Z is less common, but allowed.
- VAPOR? Ends with R, which is invalid (R is not in the word).
- LANCE? Ends with E, has A in position 2, and no R, O, S.

I think ""PLATE"" is a good choice because:
- Ends with E.
- Has A in position 2 (allowed).
- Does not contain R, O, or S.
- Uses common letters P, L, T to gather more information.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: plate -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in position 5.
   - R, O, S are not in the word.

2. plate → P(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
   - L is in position 2.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (because it showed up in position 3 with ✓, but that contradicts the first feedback that A is not in position 1). Wait, let me re-read the feedback carefully.

Actually, the feedback for plate is:
P(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)

This means:
- L is in position 2 and is correct.
- A is in the word and is in position 3 (because it got ✓).
- E is in position 5 and is correct.
- P and T are not in the word.

But this contradicts the first feedback where A was marked (-) meaning it's in the word but not in position 1. Now it's showing ✓ for position 3, so A is indeed in position 3. So the secret word has:
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: A
- Position 5: E

And it does not contain P, T, R, O, S.

So the word structure is: _ L A _ E

Possible letters for positions 1 and 4: any letters except P, T, R, O, S.

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting _ L A _ E:
- BLADE (B, L, A, D, E) - but D is allowed.
- CLAVE (C, L, A, V, E) - but V is allowed.
- FLAKE (F, L, A, K, E) - but K is allowed.
- GLADE (G, L, A, D, E) - D is allowed.
- SLATE (S is excluded, so no)
- PLATE (P is excluded, so no)

BLADE and CLAVE are good candidates. Between them, BLADE uses B and D which are common and haven't been tested yet. Let's try BLADE.

From the three guesses so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - E is in position 5.
   - R, O, S are not in the word.

2. plate → P(x) L(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
   - L is in position 2.
   - A is in position 3.
   - E is in position 5.
   - P and T are not in the word.

3. blade → B(x) L(✓) A(✓) D(x) E(✓)
   - L is still in position 2.
   - A is still in position 3.
   - E is still in position 5.
   - B and D are not in the word.

So we know the word has the pattern: _ L A _ E
Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, P, T, B, D

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has L in position 2
- Has A in position 3
- Has E in position 5
- Does not contain any of R, O, S, P, T, B, D
- The first and fourth letters must be from the remaining alphabet.

Possible first letters: C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Possible fourth letters: same set, but avoiding any already excluded.

Looking for common words that fit _ L A _ E:
- CLAVE (C, L, A, V, E) - V is allowed
- FLAKE (F, L, A, K, E) - K is allowed
- GLADE (G, L, A, D, E) - D is excluded
- SLATE (S is excluded)
- PLATE (P is excluded)

Between CLAVE and FLAKE, CLAVE uses C and V which are common and haven't been tested yet. Let's try CLAVE.
