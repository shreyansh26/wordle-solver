### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words in Wordle often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some good options are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". 

Looking at these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should help me quickly identify which vowels are in the word and which consonants are present.

Another strong contender is ""SLATE"" which has S, L, A, T, E - but I think ""AROSE"" gives slightly better vowel coverage. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it has the most vowels and common consonants.

Let’s consolidate the information we now have.

Letters we know are in the word (but we still don’t know their exact positions):
- A, R, E, C, T

Letters we know are NOT in the word:
- O, S

Positions ruled out so far:
- A is not in position 1 or 3
- R is not in position 2 or 1
- E is not in position 5 or 2
- C is not in position 4
- T is not in position 5

So every one of A, R, E, C, T must appear exactly once in the word, and they must occupy the remaining legal positions.

We have five letters (A, R, E, C, T) and five positions. Let’s list the allowed positions for each:

A: allowed in positions 2, 4, 5  
R: allowed in positions 3, 4, 5  
E: allowed in positions 1, 3, 4  
C: allowed in positions 1, 2, 3, 5  
T: allowed in positions 1, 2, 3, 4  

We need a permutation of A, R, E, C, T that satisfies these constraints. Let’s try to construct one:

- Position 1: C, T, or E  
- Position 2: C, T, or A  
- Position 3: A, R, E, or T  
- Position 4: A, R, E, or T  
- Position 5: A, R, E, or T (but E is not allowed here)

Let’s try:

Position 1: C  
Position 2: A  
Position 3: R  
Position 4: E  
Position 5: T  

Check constraints:
- C is allowed in position 1 ✅  
- A is allowed in position 2 ✅  
- R is allowed in position 3 ✅  
- E is allowed in position 4 ✅  
- T is allowed in position 5 ✅  

All constraints satisfied. The word formed is C A R E T → CARET.

Let’s verify that CARET is a valid English word. Yes, “CARET” is a valid 5-letter word (a symbol used in typography).

Therefore, our next guess is CARET.

Common starting words in Wordle often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some good options are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". \n\nLooking at these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should help me quickly identify which vowels are in the word and which consonants are present.\n\nAnother strong contender is ""SLATE"" which has S, L, A, T, E - but I think ""AROSE"" gives slightly better vowel coverage. \n\nI\'ll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it has the most vowels and common consonants.\n\n<guess>AROSE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 1\n- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2\n- O(x) → O is not in the word at all\n- S(x) → S is not in the word at all\n- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Contains A, R, E\n- Does NOT contain O or S\n- A is not in position 1\n- R is not in position 2\n- E is not in position 5\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that includes A, R, E, and avoids O and S.

From the new feedback on CARET:

- C(✓) → C is in position 1 and is correct.
- A(✓) → A is in position 2 and is correct.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 3.
- E(✓) → E is in position 4 and is correct.
- T(-) → T is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know the word looks like: C A _ E _

Letters still to place: R and T  
Positions still open: 3 and 5  
Constraints:
- R cannot be in position 3 (from CARET feedback), so R must be in position 5.
- T cannot be in position 5 (from REACT feedback), so T must be in position 3.

Thus the word must be: C A T E R

Check:
- C A T E R is a valid 5-letter English word.
- All constraints are satisfied.
