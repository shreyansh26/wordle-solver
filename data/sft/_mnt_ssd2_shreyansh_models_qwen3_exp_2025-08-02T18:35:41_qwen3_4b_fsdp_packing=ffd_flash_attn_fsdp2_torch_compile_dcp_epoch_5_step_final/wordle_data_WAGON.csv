For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters to test as many different letters as possible.

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains S, L, A, T, E - covering several very common letters. However, another strong option is ""AROSE"" which covers A, R, O, S, E. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 distinct common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:

- R is NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (so O is somewhere other than position 3).
- S is NOT in the word.
- E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:

- does NOT contain R, S, E

I need a 5-letter word that:

- avoids R, S, E
- has no other letters that are ruled out

Good next guesses should test new common letters while respecting the constraints. Common remaining letters to test: T, L, N, I, C, D, M, P, U, etc.

A good candidate is ""PLAID"":
- P, L, D are new letters
- A and O are not used, but this tests P, L, D
Wait, but we know O is in the word, so we need to include O.

Another candidate: ""COULD"":
- C, U, L, D are new letters
- O is included (in position 2, which is new)
- A is not included, but we know A is in the word (just not in position 1)

But we need to include A as well, since we know A is in the word.

From the new feedback on TANGO:

- T is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) – so A is fixed in position 2
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so N is somewhere other than position 3
- G is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so G is somewhere other than position 4
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so O is somewhere other than position 5

So far we know:

- Word pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Must contain N, G, O (each not in their previous positions)
- Cannot contain R, S, E, T
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2
- Contains N, G, O (each in new positions)
- Uses only allowed letters

Let’s list possible positions for N, G, O:

- N cannot be in position 3 → can be 1, 4, 5
- G cannot be in position 4 → can be 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 2 is A), so 1, 3, 5
- O cannot be in position 5 → can be 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 2 is A), so 1, 3, 4

We need to place N, G, O in the remaining positions (1,3,4,5) without conflicts.

Possible combinations:
- N in 1, G in 3, O in 4 → _ A N G O
- N in 1, G in 5, O in 3 → _ A O _ N
- N in 4, G in 1, O in 3 → G A O N _
- N in 5, G in 1, O in 3 → G A O _ N
- N in 4, G in 3, O in 1 → O A G N _
- N in 5, G in 3, O in 1 → O A G _ N
- N in 4, G in 5, O in 1 → O A _ N G
- N in 5, G in 4, O in 1 → O A _ G N

Now check which of these form valid words with allowed letters.

1. _ A N G O – need a letter for position 1 (not R,S,E,T). Possible: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   - BANGO? Not a word
   - CANGO? Not a word
   - FANGO? Not a word
   - HANGO? Not a word
   - LANGO? Not a word
   - MANGO – yes, MANGO is a valid word.

2. _ A O _ N – need letters for 1 and 4
   - B A O _ N – need a letter for 4 (not A, R,S,E,T). Possible: B A O G N – but G is allowed, but G was in position 4 before, and feedback said G is in wrong position (not 4), but here G is in 3 which is new. However, we need to check if B A O G N is a word – not common.
   - C A O _ N – similar issues.

3. G A O N _ – need a letter for 5. Possible: G A O N D – GANDO? Not a word.
   - G A O N K – GANK? Too short.

4. G A O _ N – need a letter for 4. G A O L N – G A O L N – not a word.

5. O A G N _ – need a letter for 5. O A G N D – OAGND? No.

6. O A G _ N – need a letter for 4. O A G L N – OAGLN? No.

7. O A _ N G – need a letter for 3. O A C N G – OACNG? No.

8. O A _ G N – need a letter for 3. O A C G N – OACGN? No.

The only valid word from these is MANGO.

Check constraints:
- A in position 2 – ✓
- Contains N, G, O – ✓
- N is not in position 3 – in MANGO, N is in 4 – ✓
- G is not in position 4 – in MANGO, G is in 5 – ✓
- O is not in position 5 – in MANGO, O is in 5 – wait! This is a conflict! O cannot be in position 5 (feedback said O is in wrong position, not 5), but MANGO has O in 5. So MANGO is invalid.

Next possible combination: _ A O _ N with G in 4? But G cannot be in 4. So need to re-examine.

Alternative approach: list possible words with A in 2, containing N, G, O, no R,S,E,T.

Possible valid words:
- MANGO – invalid because O is in 5
- CANGA – no O
- FANGO – invalid O in 5
- HANGO – invalid O in 5
- LANGO – invalid O in 5
- PANGO – invalid O in 5
- VANGO – invalid O in 5

Wait, maybe O is in position 4:
Pattern: _ A _ O _
Then N and G must fit in 1,3,5 with constraints:
- N not in 3
- G not in 4 (already O)
So N can be 1,4,5 (but 4 is O), so 1 or 5
G can be 1,3,5

Possible:
- N in 1, G in 3 → N A G O _
- N in 5, G in 1 → G A _ O N
- N in 5, G in 3 → _ A G O N

Check these:
1. N A G O _ – need letter for 5. N A G O D – NAGOD? No.
2. G A _ O N – need letter for 3. G A B O N – GABON? Yes, GABON is a valid word (a country).
3. _ A G O N – need letter for 1. B A G O N – BAGON? Yes, BAGON is a Pokémon.

Between GABON and BAGON, both are valid. Let’s pick GABON.

Check constraints:
- A in 2 – ✓
- Contains N, G, O – ✓
- N is in 5 (not 3) – ✓
- G is in 1 (not 4) – ✓
- O is in 4 (not 5) – ✓
- No R,S,E,T – ✓

GABON is valid.

<guess>GABON</guess>",GABON,"From the new feedback on TANGO:

- T is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) – so A is fixed in position 2
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so N is somewhere other than position 3
- G is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so G is somewhere other than position 4
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so O is somewhere other than position 5

So far we know:

- Word pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Must contain N, G, O (each not in their previous positions)
- Cannot contain R, S, E, T
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2
- Contains N, G, O (each in new positions)
- Uses only allowed letters

Let’s list possible positions for N, G, O:

- N cannot be in position 3 → can be 1, 4, 5
- G cannot be in position 4 → can be 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 2 is A), so 1, 3, 5
- O cannot be in position 5 → can be 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 2 is A), so 1, 3, 4

We need to place N, G, O in the remaining positions (1,3,4,5) without conflicts.

Possible combinations:
- N in 1, G in 3, O in 4 → _ A N G O
- N in 1, G in 5, O in 3 → _ A O _ N
- N in 4, G in 1, O in 3 → G A O N _
- N in 5, G in 1, O in 3 → G A O _ N
- N in 4, G in 3, O in 1 → O A G N _
- N in 5, G in 3, O in 1 → O A G _ N
- N in 4, G in 5, O in 1 → O A _ N G
- N in 5, G in 4, O in 1 → O A _ G N

Now check which of these form valid words with allowed letters.

1. _ A N G O – need a letter for position 1 (not R,S,E,T). Possible: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   - BANGO? Not a word
   - CANGO? Not a word
   - FANGO? Not a word
   - HANGO? Not a word
   - LANGO? Not a word
   - MANGO – yes, MANGO is a valid word.

2. _ A O _ N – need letters for 1 and 4
   - B A O _ N – need a letter for 4 (not A, R,S,E,T). Possible: B A O G N – but G is allowed, but G was in position 4 before, and feedback said G is in wrong position (not 4), but here G is in 3 which is new. However, we need to check if B A O G N is a word – not common.
   - C A O _ N – similar issues.

3. G A O N _ – need a letter for 5. Possible: G A O N D – GANDO? Not a word.
   - G A O N K – GANK? Too short.

4. G A O _ N – need a letter for 4. G A O L N – G A O L N – not a word.

5. O A G N _ – need a letter for 5. O A G N D – OAGND? No.

6. O A G _ N – need a letter for 4. O A G L N – OAGLN? No.

7. O A _ N G – need a letter for 3. O A C N G – OACNG? No.

8. O A _ G N – need a letter for 3. O A C G N – OACGN? No.

The only valid word from these is MANGO.

Check constraints:
- A in position 2 – ✓
- Contains N, G, O – ✓
- N is not in position 3 – in MANGO, N is in 4 – ✓
- G is not in position 4 – in MANGO, G is in 5 – ✓
- O is not in position 5 – in MANGO, O is in 5 – wait! This is a conflict! O cannot be in position 5 (feedback said O is in wrong position, not 5), but MANGO has O in 5. So MANGO is invalid.

Next possible combination: _ A O _ N with G in 4? But G cannot be in 4. So need to re-examine.

Alternative approach: list possible words with A in 2, containing N, G, O, no R,S,E,T.

Possible valid words:
- MANGO – invalid because O is in 5
- CANGA – no O
- FANGO – invalid O in 5
- HANGO – invalid O in 5
- LANGO – invalid O in 5
- PANGO – invalid O in 5
- VANGO – invalid O in 5

Wait, maybe O is in position 4:
Pattern: _ A _ O _
Then N and G must fit in 1,3,5 with constraints:
- N not in 3
- G not in 4 (already O)
So N can be 1,4,5 (but 4 is O), so 1 or 5
G can be 1,3,5

Possible:
- N in 1, G in 3 → N A G O _
- N in 5, G in 1 → G A _ O N
- N in 5, G in 3 → _ A G O N

Check these:
1. N A G O _ – need letter for 5. N A G O D – NAGOD? No.
2. G A _ O N – need letter for 3. G A B O N – GABON? Yes, GABON is a valid word (a country).
3. _ A G O N – need letter for 1. B A G O N – BAGON? Yes, BAGON is a Pokémon.

Between GABON and BAGON, both are valid. Let’s pick GABON.

Check constraints:
- A in 2 – ✓
- Contains N, G, O – ✓
- N is in 5 (not 3) – ✓
- G is in 1 (not 4) – ✓

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. Common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these common letters to test as many different letters as possible.

One of the most popular starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains S, L, A, T, E - covering several very common letters. However, another strong option is ""AROSE"" which covers A, R, O, S, E. 

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 distinct common letters and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is somewhere other than position 1).
- R is NOT in the word.
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (so O is somewhere other than position 3).
- S is NOT in the word.
- E is NOT in the word.

So the secret word:
- contains A and O (but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively)
- does NOT contain R, S, E

I need a 5-letter word that:
- has A and O somewhere
- avoids R, S, E
- has no other letters that are ruled out

Good next guesses should test new common letters while respecting the constraints. Common remaining letters to test: T, L, N, I, C, D, M, P, U, etc.

A good candidate is ""PLAID"":
- P, L, D are new letters
- A and O are not used, but this tests P, L, D
Wait, but we know O is in the word, so we need to include O.

Another candidate: ""COULD"":
- C, U, L, D are new letters
- O is included (in position 2, which is new)
- A is not included, but we know A is in the word (just not in position 1)

But we need to include A as well, since we know A is in the word.

So ""COULD"" is bad because it doesn't include A.

Better candidate: ""PAINT"":
- P, I, N, T are new letters
- A is included (in position 2, which is new)
- O is not included, but we know O is in the word (but not in position 3)

Hmm, but we must include O since we know O is in the word.

So ""PAINT"" is bad because it doesn't include O.

Next candidate: ""MADAM"":
- M, D are new letters
- A is included (positions 2 and 4)
- O is not included, but we know O is in the word

This is bad.

Next candidate: ""ADOPT"":
- A is included (position 1, but feedback says A is in the word but not in position 1, so this is bad)
- O is included (position 2)
- D, P, T are new letters

But A cannot be in position 1, so ""ADOPT"" is bad.

Next candidate: ""TANGO"":
- T, N, G are new letters
- A is included (position 2)
- O is included (position 5)
- This respects all constraints:
  - A is not in position 1 (it's in 2)
  - O is not in position 3 (it's in 5)
  - No R, S, E
  - Tests new letters T, N, G

This seems good.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on TANGO:

- T is NOT in the word (x)
- A is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) – so A is fixed in position 2
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so N is somewhere other than position 3
- G is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so G is somewhere other than position 4
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so O is somewhere other than position 5

So far we know:

- Word pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Must contain N, G, O (each not in their previous positions)
- Cannot contain R, S, E, T
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2
- Contains N, G, O (each in new positions)
- Uses only allowed letters

Let’s list possible positions for N, G, O:

- N cannot be in position 3 → can be 1, 4, 5
- G cannot be in position 4 → can be 1, 2, 3, 5 (but 2 is A), so 1, 3, 5
- O cannot be in position 5 → can be 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 2 is A), so 1, 3, 4

We need to place N, G, O in the remaining positions (1,3,4,5) without conflicts.

Possible combinations:
- N in 1, G in 3, O in 4 → _ A N G O
- N in 1, G in 5, O in 3 → _ A O _ N
- N in 4, G in 1, O in 3 → G A O N _

- N in 4, G in 5, O in 1 → O A _ N G
- N in 5, G in 4, O in 1 → O A _ G N

Now check which of these form valid words with allowed letters.

1. _ A N G O – need a letter for position 1 (not R,S,E,T). Possible: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
   - BANGO? Not a word
   - CANGO? Not a word
   - FANGO? Not a word
   - HANGO? Not a word
   - LANGO? Not a word
   - MANGO – yes, MANGO is a valid word.

2. _ A O _ N – need letters for 1 and 4
   - B A O _ N – need a letter for 4 (not A, R,S,E,T). Possible: B A O G N – but G is allowed, but G was in position 4 before, and feedback said G is in wrong position (not 4), but here G is in 3 which is new. However, we need to check if B A O G N is a word – not common.
   - C A O _ N – similar issues.

3. G A O N _ – need a letter for 5. Possible: G A O N D – GANDO? Not a word.
   - G A O N K – GANK? Too short.

4. G A O _ N – need a letter for 4. G A O L N – G A O L N – not a word.

5. O A G N _ – need a letter for 5. O A G N D – OAGND? No.

6. O A G _ N – need a letter for 4. O A G L N – OAGLN? No.

7. O A _ N G – need a letter for 3. O A C N G – OACNG? No.

8. O A _ G N – need a letter for 3. O A C G N – OACGN? No.

The only valid word from these is MANGO.

Check constraints:
- A in position 2 – ✓
- Contains N, G, O – ✓
- N is not in position 3 – in MANGO, N is in 4 – ✓
- G is not in position 4 – in MANGO, G is in 5 – ✓
- O is not in position 5 – in MANGO, O is in 5 – wait! This is a conflict! O cannot be in position 5 (feedback said O is in wrong position, not 5), but MANGO has O in 5. So MANGO is invalid.

Next possible combination: _ A O _ N with G in 4? But G cannot be in 4. So need to re-examine.

Alternative approach: list possible words with A in 2, containing N, G, O, no R,S,E,T.

- CANGA – no O
- FANGO – invalid O in 5
- HANGO – invalid O in 5
- LANGO – invalid O in 5
- PANGO – invalid O in 5
- VANGO – invalid O in 5

Wait, maybe O is in position 4:
Pattern: _ A _ O _
Then N and G must fit in 1,3,5 with constraints:
- N not in 3
- G not in 4 (already O)
So N can be 1,4,5 (but 4 is O), so 1 or 5
G can be 1,3,5

Possible:
- N in 1, G in 3 → N A G O _
- N in 5, G in 1 → G A _ O N
- N in 5, G in 3 → _ A G O N

Check these:
1. N A G O _ – need letter for 5. N A G O D – NAGOD? No.
2. G A _ O N – need letter for 3. G A B O N – GABON? Yes, GABON is a valid word (a country).
3. _ A G O N – need letter for 1. B A G O N – BAGON? Yes, BAGON is a Pokémon.

Between GABON and BAGON, both are valid. Let’s pick GABON.

So need to re-examine.\n\nAlternative approach: list possible words with A in 2, containing N, G, O, no R,S,E,T.\n\nPossible valid words:\n- MANGO – invalid because O is in 5\n- CANGA – no O\n- FANGO – invalid O in 5\n- HANGO – invalid O in 5\n- LANGO – invalid O in 5\n- PANGO – invalid O in 5\n- VANGO – invalid O in 5\n\nWait, maybe O is in position 4:\nPattern: _ A _ O _\nThen N and G must fit in 1,3,5 with constraints:\n- N not in 3\n- G not in 4 (already O)\nSo N can be 1,4,5 (but 4 is O), so 1 or 5\nG can be 1,3,5\n\nPossible:\n- N in 1, G in 3 → N A G O _\n- N in 5, G in 1 → G A _ O N\n- N in 5, G in 3 → _ A G O N\n\nCheck these:\n1. N A G O _ – need letter for 5. N A G O D – NAGOD? No.\n2. G A _ O N – need letter for 3. G A B O N – GABON? Yes, GABON is a valid word (a country).\n3. _ A G O N – need letter for 1. B A G O N – BAGON? Yes, BAGON is a Pokémon.\n\nBetween GABON and BAGON, both are valid. Let’s pick GABON.\n\nCheck constraints:\n- A in 2 – ✓\n- Contains N, G, O – ✓\n- N is in 5 (not 3) – ✓\n- G is in 1 (not 4) – ✓\n- O is in 4 (not 5) – ✓\n- No R,S,E,T – ✓\n\nGABON is valid.\n\n<guess>GABON</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: TANGO -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) N(-) G(-) O(-)\nGuess 3: GABON -> FEEDBACK: G(-) A(✓) B(x) O(✓) N(✓)\n'}]","<think>
Let’s digest the new feedback on GABON:

G(-) – G is in the word but NOT in position 1  
A(✓) – A is fixed in position 2  
B(x) – B is NOT in the word  
O(✓) – O is fixed in position 4  
N(✓) – N is fixed in position 5  

So the word pattern is now:  
_ A _ O N  

Letters we know are in the word: A, O, N, G  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, S, E, T, B  

Positions ruled out so far:
- G cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (but 4 is O, so only 1 is ruled out)  
- N is fixed in 5  
- O is fixed in 4  
- A is fixed in 2  

Thus G must appear in positions 3 or 5, but 5 is N, so G must be in position 3.

Therefore the word must be:  
_ A G O N  

We just need a valid 5-letter word that starts with a consonant (not ruled out) and fits this pattern.

Possible first letters (not yet ruled out): C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for real words:
- CAGON? No  
- DAGON? No  
- FAGON? No  
- HAGON? No  
- MAGON? No  
- PAGON? No  
- VAGON? No  
- WAGON? Yes! WAGON is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- W is not yet ruled out  
- A is in 2, G in 3, O in 4, N in 5 – matches pattern  
- No forbidden letters (R,S,E,T,B)
