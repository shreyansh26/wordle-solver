### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give us good information about which vowels are present and their positions, as well as whether R or S are in the word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but in the wrong position (not fourth).
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct fifth position.

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains A and S somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.
3. It does NOT contain R or O.

Good letters to include next are common consonants that haven't been ruled out. I'll try a word that:
- Keeps E in the fifth position.
- Places A and S in new positions.
- Uses other common consonants.

A strong candidate is ""SLATE"":
- S in position 1 (new position for S).
- L and T are common letters not yet used.
- A in position 3 (new position for A).
- E stays in position 5.

This should help determine the correct positions for A and S while testing new consonants.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - A and S are in the word but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.
   - R and O are not in the word.

2. SLATE → S(-) L(x) A(-) T(✓) E(✓)
   - T is fixed in position 4.
   - E is still fixed in position 5.
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - L is not in the word.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ _ T E
- Letters known to be in the word: A, S
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, O, L
- Positions ruled out:
  - S cannot be in 1 or 4 (but 4 is T anyway), so S must be in 2 or 3.
  - A cannot be in 1 or 3, so A must be in 2 or 3.

Possible patterns:
- If S is in 2: _ S _ T E
  - Then A must be in 3: _ S A T E
- If S is in 3: _ _ S T E
  - Then A must be in 2: _ A S T E

So two candidate patterns:
1. _ S A T E
2. _ A S T E

We need a 5-letter word that fits one of these patterns and uses only allowed letters. The first pattern _ S A T E: common words might be ""CHASE"" but C is allowed. However, we haven't tested C yet. The second pattern _ A S T E: possible words include ""MATCH"" but C is allowed, but T is already used in 4. Actually, ""MATCH"" would be M A T C H, but we need T in 4 and E in 5, so ""MATCH"" doesn't fit. 

Looking at _ S A T E: ""CHASE"" fits (C H A S E), but S is in 3 here, not 2. Wait, no: ""CHASE"" is C H A S E, which would be positions 1:C, 2:H, 3:A, 4:S, 5:E. But S is in 4, which is T's position. That's invalid.

Actually, the pattern _ S A T E would require S in 2, A in 3, T in 4, E in 5. A word fitting this is ""PASTE"" (P A S T E), but A is in 2, S in 3, which would fit _ A S T E. 

Wait, let's re-examine:
- Pattern _ A S T E: positions 1:?, 2:A, 3:S, 4:T, 5:E
  - Possible words: ""HASTE"" (H A S T E), ""M A S T E"" (but ""MASTE"" isn't a word), ""GASTE"" (not a word), ""BASTE"" (B A S T E), ""FASTE"" (archaic), ""LASTE"" (not a word), ""VASTE"" (not a word), ""WASTE"" (W A S T E). ""WASTE"" is a valid word.

""CHASE"" would be C H A S E, which is positions 1:C, 2:H, 3:A, 4:S, 5:E. But S is in 4, which is T's position, so that's invalid.

""WASTE"" fits _ A S T E:
- W (1), A (2), S (3), T (4), E (5)
- Checks all constraints:
  - T in 4, E in 5 ✓
  - S in 3 (allowed, since S can't be in 1 or 4) ✓
  - A in 2 (allowed, since A can't be in 1 or 3) ✓
  - No R, O, L ✓
  - Uses new letters W to test.

Therefore, ""WASTE"" is a good next guess.
