### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Some good starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", ""AUDIO"", or ""AROSE"". 

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly effective because:
- S, L, T are common consonants
- A and E are very common vowels
- It covers 5 distinct letters

This should give us good coverage to narrow down possibilities for the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- L, A, T, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the word starts with S and contains none of L, A, T, E.  
We need a 5-letter word beginning with S and avoiding those letters.

Good consonants to try next: R, N, D, M, C, P, B, G, H, etc.  
Good vowels to try: I, O, U (since A and E are ruled out).

Let’s pick a word that uses S plus common remaining letters.  
""SHORN"" uses S, H, O, R, N – none of which are L, A, T, E.  
This tests H, O, R, N while keeping S fixed in the first position.

Another option could be ""SPURN"" or ""SPOOK"", but ""SHORN"" seems balanced.

Current constraints:
1. Word starts with S (position 1).

3. Letter R is in the word but not in position 4.

Remaining possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, R, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing R somewhere other than position 4, and using only the allowed letters.

Possible patterns:

- S _ R _ _  (R in position 3)

Current constraints:
1. Word starts with S (position 1).
2. Letters not in the word at all: L, A, T, E, H, O, N, C, B.
3. Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct positions:
   - S in position 1
   - R in position 3
   - U in position 4
4. Letters still allowed: D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, R, S, V, W, X, Y, Z
   (but R, S, U are already placed, so we need two more letters from the remaining set.)

So the word looks like: S _ R U _

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits S _ R U _ and uses only the allowed letters.

Possible letters for position 2 and 5: D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common words:
- S D R U _ : no common word
- S F R U _ : no common word
- S G R U _ : no common word
- S I R U _ : SIRUM? not a word
- S K R U _ : SKUNK is a word, but it would be S K R U N, but N is already excluded.
- S M R U _ : no common word
- S P R U _ : SPRUG? not common
- S V R U _ : no
- S W R U _ : SWIRL? but L is excluded
- S Y R U _ : SYRUP! - S Y R U P. Let's check letters: S, Y, R, U, P. All allowed (Y and P are in the remaining set). And it fits S _ R U _.

SYRUP seems to fit all constraints.
