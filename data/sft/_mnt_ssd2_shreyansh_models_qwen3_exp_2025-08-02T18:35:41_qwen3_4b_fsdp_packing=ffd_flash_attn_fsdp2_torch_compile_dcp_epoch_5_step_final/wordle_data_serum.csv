### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are definitely in the word: S (position 1 confirmed), E, R  
   Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, T, N

2. Positional information:
   - S is fixed in position 1.
   - E is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 5 (it was in position 3 in stern and got (-), and in position 5 in arose and got (-)).
   - R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (it was in position 2 in arose and got (-), and in position 4 in stern and got (-)).

3. Therefore:
   - The word starts with S.
   - E must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But position 1 is already S, so E must be in position 2 or 4.
   - R must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But position 1 is S, so R must be in position 3 or 5.

4. We need a valid 5-letter word that:
   - Starts with S
   - Contains E in position 2 or 4
   - Contains R in position 3 or 5
   - Does NOT contain A, O, T, N
   - Uses only letters we haven't ruled out.

Possible candidates:
- S _ R _ E (R in 3, E in 5) - but E can't be in 5
- S E _ R _ (E in 2, R in 4) - but R can't be in 4
- S _ E R _ (E in 4, R in 5) - valid positions
- S E R _ _ (E in 2, R in 3) - valid positions

Looking at common words:
- SERVE: starts with S, E in 2, R in 3, ends with V and E. But we already know E can't be in 5, but this has E in 2 and 5 - the second E is invalid.
- SIREN: contains N (invalid)
- SPIRE: starts with S, I, R, E - but E is in 4, R is in 3 - positions valid. Contains I which is new.
- SPIRE: S P I R E - positions: S(1), P(2), I(3), R(4), E(5). But R can't be in 4 (from stern feedback), so this is invalid.
- SHERD: contains H and D - but we need E and R in valid positions.

- SERVE: starts with S, E in 2, R in 3, ends with V and E. But we already know E can't be in 5, but this has E in 2 and 5 - the second E is invalid.
- SIREN: contains N (invalid)
- SPIRE: starts with S, I, R, E - but E is in 4, R is in 3 - positions valid. Contains I which is new.
- SPIRE: S P I R E - positions: S(1), P(2), I(3), R(4), E(5). But R can't be in 4 (from stern feedback), so this is invalid.
- SHERD: contains H and D - but we need E and R in valid positions.
- SHIRE: S H I R E - R is in 4 (invalid)
- SIREL: not a valid word
- SURED: contains U and D - but we need E in 2 or 4, R in 3 or 5.
- SURED: S U R E D - R is in 3 (valid), E is in 4 (valid). Starts with S. No A, O, T, N. This seems valid.

""SURED"" fits all constraints:
- S in position 1 (✓)
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- No A, O, T, N
- Valid English word.

Let's go with SURED.

From all feedback so far:

Letters confirmed in the word: S (position 1), R (position 3)  
Letters confirmed NOT in the word: A, O, T, N, D  

Letters whose status is still unknown but have been seen as “-” (present but wrong position):  
- E – must appear somewhere, but NOT in positions 3, 4, 5 (from arose, stern, sured)  
- U – must appear somewhere, but NOT in position 2  

Positions already fixed:  
- Position 1 = S  
- Position 3 = R  

So the pattern so far is:  
S _ R _ _

E must be in position 2 (only remaining slot that is not yet ruled out).  
U must go in position 4 or 5 (since it cannot be in position 2).  

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form S E R _ _ that does not contain A, O, T, N, D.  
Letters still allowed: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus any others not yet ruled out).

Possible candidates:  
- SERUM – but U is in position 5, which is allowed, and M is new.  
- SERVE – but V is new and E is in position 5, which is ruled out.  
- SERFS – but F is new and S is already used in position 1.  
- SERIN – but N is ruled out.  
- SERAI – but A is ruled out.  

“SERUM” is the only common word that fits:  
S E R U M – positions: S(1), E(2), R(3), U(4), M(5).  
- All letters are allowed.  
- E is in position 2 (never ruled out).  
- U is in position 4 (never ruled out).  
- No forbidden letters.
