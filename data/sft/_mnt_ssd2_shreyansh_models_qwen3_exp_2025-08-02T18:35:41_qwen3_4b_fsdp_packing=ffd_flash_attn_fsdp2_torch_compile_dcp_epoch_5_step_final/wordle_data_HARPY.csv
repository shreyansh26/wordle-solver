### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

Looking at these letters, the word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word, providing useful information for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on “arose”:

- O(x)  → O is not in the word at all

1. The word contains A and R somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
2. The word does NOT contain O, S, or E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A and R
- Does NOT have O, S, or E
- Places A and R in new positions (not 1st and 2nd)

Good candidates: “train”, “brain”, “fairy”, “carat”, “tarot” (but “tarot” has O which we know is out), “drain”, “grain”, “crank”, etc.

Among these, “train” seems good:
- T, R, A, I, N
- Uses R and A in new positions (R is 2nd, A is 3rd – different from 1st and 2nd in arose)
- No O, S, or E
- Common letters T, I, N give additional info

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. train → T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T, I, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (already knew that).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (so A must be in position 4 or 5).

Summary of what we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, R
- Positions:
  – A is not in 1, 3 → must be in 4 or 5.
  – R is not in 2 → could be 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and R.
- Has A in position 4 or 5.
- Has R in any position except 2.
- Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.

Good remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we want common ones).

Possible patterns:
- If A is in position 4: _ _ _ A R
- If A is in position 5: _ _ _ _ A

Let’s look for common words fitting these patterns.

Pattern _ _ _ A R:
- BARDY (but Y is uncommon)
- CARDS (has S, which is out)
- FARDY (rare)
- HARDY (H, A, R, D, Y) – valid word, uses common letters.

Pattern _ _ _ _ A:
- R A _ _ A – invalid (A twice)
- _ R _ _ A – R in position 2 is invalid (from arose feedback)
- _ _ R _ A – R in position 3
- _ _ _ R A – R in position 4

Example: B R _ _ A – “BRAGA” (but G and A are ok, but is it a word?)
“BRAGA” is a valid word (a type of skirt).

Another: C R _ _ A – “CRANK” (has N, out)
“CRUST” (S, out)
“CRISP” (S, out)
“CRUEL” (E, out)
“CRANE” (E, out)
“CRAMP” (P ok, but M ok) – “CRAMP” has A in 4, R in 2 (invalid)

“BRAND” (N out)
“BRAND” – N is out
“BRAGA” seems best so far.

But “BRAGA” has A in 5, R in 2 (invalid). So invalid.

Let’s try A in 4:
Pattern _ _ _ A R:
- B A R D Y – but A is 2, not 4
- C A R D S – S out
- F A R D Y – A 2
- H A R D Y – A 2
- B A R G E – E out
- C A R V A – A 2
- D A R K – too short
- F A R M – too short
- G A R B – too short
- M A R V – too short

Wait, we need A in 4 and R in 5:
Pattern _ _ _ A R:
- B A R D Y – A is 2
- C A R D S – A 2
- D A R K – too short
- F A R M – too short
- H A R D Y – A 2
- J A R V – too short
- L A R G – too short
- M A R V – too short
- P A R K – A 2
- V A R M – too short
- W A R M – A 2
- Y A R D – A 2

Hmm, none of these have A in 4. Let’s try A in 5:
Pattern _ _ _ _ A:
- R _ _ _ A – R in 1
- _ R _ _ A – R in 2 (invalid)
- _ _ R _ A – R in 3
- _ _ _ R A – R in 4

Example:
- R A _ _ A – A 2,4 (invalid)
- _ R A _ A – A 3,5 (invalid)
- _ _ R A A – A 4,5 (invalid)
- _ _ _ R A – A 5, R 4

Valid words:
- B R U R A – not common
- C R U R A – not common
- F R U R A – not common
- G R U R A – not common
- H R U R A – not common
- J R U R A – not common
- M R U R A – not common
- P R U R A – not common
- V R U R A – not common
- W R U R A – not common

This is tricky. Let’s try a different approach: list words with A and R, no O/S/E/T/I/N, and A in 4 or 5.

Remaining letters: A, R plus any of B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- B R A D Y – A 3 (invalid)
- C R A V A – A 3
- D R A G – too short
- F R A G – too short
- G R A M – too short
- H A R D – A 2
- J A R V – too short
- K A R T – T out
- L A R G – too short
- M A R V – too short
- P A R K – A 2
- V A R M – too short
- W A R M – A 2
- Y A R D – A 2

Wait, none of these have A in 4 or 5. Let’s try A in 5:
Pattern _ _ _ _ A:
- B R U D A – B, R, U, D, A – all allowed, common word.
- C R U D A – C, R, U, D, A – valid.
- F R U D A – F, R, U, D, A – valid.
- G R U D A – G, R, U, D, A – valid.
- H R U D A – H, R, U, D, A – valid.
- J R U D A – J, R, U, D, A – valid.
- M R U D A – M, R, U, D, A – valid.
- P R U D A – P, R, U, D, A – valid.
- V R U D A – V, R, U, D, A – valid.
- W R U D A – W, R, U, D, A – valid.

“BRUDA” is not a common word. “CRUDA” is not a word. “F R U D A” – “FRULA” is not a word.

Let me think of actual common words:
- “GRAFT” – has T (out)
- “GRAPE” – has E (out)
- “GRAVY” – Y ok, but A 3
- “GRAIN” – N out
- “GRAFT” – T out
- “GRAPE” – E out
- “GRASP” – S out
- “GRATE” – E out
- “GRIMY” – I out
- “GRIND” – N, I, D – I out, N out
- “GRIND” – N out
- “GRIPS” – S out
- “GRIT” – too short
- “GRUNT” – N, T out
- “GRYPH” – not common
- “GRYPH” – not common

Let me try “GRAVY” – A 3 (invalid)
“GRAVY” – A 3 (invalid)

“CRANK” – N, K ok, but A 3 (invalid)
“CRANK” – A 3 (invalid)

“BRAND” – N out
“BRAND” – N out

“PRANK” – N out
“PRANK” – N out

“DRANK” – N out
“DRANK” – N out

“CRAMP” – A 3 (invalid)
“CRAMP” – A 3 (invalid)

“FRANK” – A 3 (invalid)
“FRANK” – A 3 (invalid)

“GRAMP” – not a word
“GRAMP” – not a word

“GRAPE” – E out
“GRAPE” – E out

“GRAFT” – T out
“GRAFT” – T out

“GRAVY” – A 3 (invalid)
“GRAVY” – A 3 (invalid)

“GRAVY” – A 3 (invalid)

This is harder than expected. Let me try “R A _ _ A” – but A 2 invalid.

Let me try “R _ _ _ A” – R 1:
- R A B Y A – not a word
- R A C Y A – not a word
- R A D Y A – not a word
- R A F A – too short
- R A G A – too short
- R A H A – too short
- R A J A – too short
- R A K A – too short
- R A L A – too short
- R A M A – too short
- R A P A – too short

- R A U A – too short
- R A V A – too short
- R A W A – too short
- R A X A – too short
- R A Y A – too short
- R A Z A – too short

No luck. Let me try “_ R _ _ A” – R 2 invalid.

Let me try “_ _ R _ A” – R 3:
- B R A D A – A 3 (invalid)
- C R A D A – A 3 (invalid)
- D R A D A – A 3 (invalid)
- F R A D A – A 3 (invalid)
- G R A D A – A 3 (invalid)

- P A R D A – A 2 (invalid)
- V A R D A – A 2 (invalid)

Let me try “_ _ _ A R” – A 4:
- B U A R D – not a word
- C U A R D – not a word
- D U A R D – not a word
- F U A R D – not a word
- G U A R D – G, U, A, R, D – all allowed, common word “GUARD”

- M U A R D – not a word
- P U A R D – not a word
- V U A R D – not a word
- W U A R D – not a word
- Y U A R D – not a word

“GUARD” is a valid word, fits:
- G, U, A, R, D – none are O, S, E, T, I, N
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- R is in position 5 (allowed)
- No other letters ruled out

This seems to be the best candidate.
</think>

Based on the feedback, the word must contain A and R, cannot have O, S, E, T, I, N, and A must be in position 4 or 5 while R must be elsewhere. The word ""GUARD"" fits these constraints perfectly.

<guess>guard</guess>",guard,"From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. train → T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T, I, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (already knew that).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (so A must be in position 4 or 5).

Summary of what we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, R
- Positions:
  – A is not in 1, 3 → must be in 4 or 5.
  – R is not in 2 → could be 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and R.
- Has A in position 4 or 5.
- Has R in any position except 2.
- Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.

Good remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we want common ones).

Possible patterns:
- If A is in position 4: _ _ _ A R
- If A is in position 5: _ _ _ _ A

Let’s look for common words fitting these patterns.

Pattern _ _ _ A R:
- BARDY (but Y is uncommon)
- CARDS (has S, which is out)
- FARDY (rare)
- HARDY (H, A, R, D, Y) – valid word, uses common letters.

Pattern _ _ _ _ A:
- R A _ _ A – invalid (A twice)
- _ R _ _ A – R in position 2 is invalid (from arose feedback)
- _ _ R _ A – R in position 3

Example: B R _ _ A – “BRAGA” (but G and A are ok, but is it a word?)
“BRAGA” is a valid word (a type of skirt).

“CRAMP” (P ok, but M ok) – “CRAMP” has A in 4, R in 2 (invalid)

“BRAGA” seems best so far.

But “BRAGA” has A in 5, R in 2 (invalid). So invalid.

This is tricky. Let’s try a different approach: list words with A and R, no O/S/E/T/I/N, and A in 4 or 5.

Remaining letters: A, R plus any of B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

<|im_start|>user

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

Looking at these letters, the word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word, providing useful information for subsequent guesses.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-)  → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st)
- R(-)  → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd)
- O(x)  → O is not in the word at all
- S(x)  → S is not the word at all
- E(x)  → E is not the word at all

So we know:
1. The word contains A and R somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
2. The word does NOT contain O, S, or E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A and R
- Does NOT have O, S, or E
- Places A and R in new positions (not 1st and 2nd)

Good candidates: “train”, “brain”, “fairy”, “carat”, “tarot” (but “tarot” has O which we know is out), “drain”, “grain”, “crank”, etc.

Among these, “train” seems good:
- T, R, A, I, N
- Uses R and A in new positions (R is 2nd, A is 3rd – different from 1st and 2nd in arose)
- No O, S, or E
- Common letters T, I, N give additional info

Guess 2: train -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. train → T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T, I, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (already knew that).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (so A must be in position 4 or 5).

Summary of what we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, R
- Positions:
  – A is not in 1, 3 → must be in 4 or 5.
  – R is not in 2 → could be 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and R.
- Has A in position 4 or 5.
- Has R in any position except 2.
- Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.

Good remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we want common ones).

Possible patterns:
- If A is in position 4: _ _ _ A R

Let’s look for common words fitting these patterns.

This seems to be the best candidate.Based on the feedback, the word must contain A and R, cannot have O, S, E, T, I, N, and A must be in position 4 or 5 while R must be elsewhere. The word ""GUARD"" fits these constraints perfectly.

From all feedback so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word:
O, S, E, T, I, N, G, U, D

Letters that ARE in the word:
A (but not in positions 1, 3, 4)
R (but not in positions 2, 4, 5)

So:
- A must be in position 2 or 5
- R must be in position 1, 3

Remaining allowed letters: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus A and R already known)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and R
- A in 2 or 5
- R in 1 or 3
- Uses only the allowed letters

Possible patterns:
1. R _ A _ _  (R in 1, A in 3 – but A cannot be in 3)
2. R _ _ _ A  (R in 1, A in 5)
3. _ R A _ _  (R in 3, A in 2)
4. _ R _ _ A  (R in 3, A in 5)

Let’s explore pattern 2: R _ _ _ A
Need three letters in positions 2-4, not using any banned letters.
Possible: R B L C A – but “RBLCA” is not a word.
Real words: R A _ _ A – A cannot be in 2 (since A must be in 2 or 5, but 2 is taken by R)
Actually pattern 2 is R _ _ _ A.

Looking for real words:
- R A B B A – but B is allowed, but “RABBA” is not common
- R A C K A – C, K allowed – “RACKA” not a word
- R A F F A – not a word
- R A P A – too short
- R A B A – too short

Pattern 3: _ R A _ _
Need letters in 1,4,5, not banned, and A in 2, R in 3.
Example: B R A C K – but C, K allowed – “BRACK” is a word (variant of “brackish”)
Check constraints:
- B (allowed)
- R (allowed, in 2 – but R must be in 1 or 3 – 2 is invalid)
Oops, R must be in 1 or 3. In _ R A _ _, R is in 2 which is invalid.

Pattern 4: _ R _ _ A
R in 3, A in 5.
Example: B R A C A – but C allowed, A in 5
Real word: B R A C A – not a word
C R A V A – not a word
F R A C A – not a word
H R A C A – not a word
L R A C A – not a word
M R A C A – not a word
P R A C A – not a word
V R A C A – not a word
W R A C A – not a word

Let’s try pattern 2 again with valid words:
R _ _ _ A
Real word: R A B B A – not common
R A C K A – not a word
R A F F A – not a word
R A P A – too short
R A B A – too short

Hmm, let’s try pattern 3 with R in 3 and A in 2:
_ R A _ _
Real word: B R A C K – but R is in 2 which is invalid
C R A C K – C, K allowed, R in 2 invalid
F R A C K – R in 2 invalid
H R A C K – R in 2 invalid
L R A C K – R in 2 invalid
M R A C K – R in 2 invalid
P R A C K – R in 2 invalid
V R A C K – R in 2 invalid
W R A C K – R in 2 invalid

Let me think differently: A must be in 2 or 5, R must be in 1 or 3.

Case 1: A in 2, R in 1 → R A _ _ _
Letters allowed: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

R A C K W – W allowed – “RACKW” not a word

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

Looking at these letters, the word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word, providing useful information for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-)  → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st)
- R(-)  → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd)
- O(x)  → O is not in the word at all
- S(x)  → S is not the word at all
- E(x)  → E is not the word at all

So we know:
1. The word contains A and R somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
2. The word does NOT contain O, S, or E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A and R
- Does NOT have O, S, or E
- Places A and R in new positions (not 1st and 2nd)

Good candidates: “train”, “brain”, “fairy”, “carat”, “tarot” (but “tarot” has O which we know is out), “drain”, “grain”, “crank”, etc.

Among these, “train” seems good:
- T, R, A, I, N
- Uses R and A in new positions (R is 2nd, A is 3rd – different from 1st and 2nd in arose)
- No O, S, or E
- Common letters T, I, N give additional info

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: train -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. train → T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T, I, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (already knew that).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (so A must be in position 4 or 5).

Summary of what we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, R
- Positions:
  – A is not in 1, 3 → must be in 4 or 5.
  – R is not in 2 → could be 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and R.
- Has A in position 4 or 5.
- Has R in any position except 2.
- Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.

Good remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we want common ones).

Possible patterns:
- If A is in position 4: _ _ _ A R
- If A is in position 5: _ _ _ _ A

Let’s look for common words fitting these patterns.

Pattern _ _ _ A R:
- BARDY (but Y is uncommon)
- CARDS (has S, which is out)
- FARDY (rare)
- HARDY (H, A, R, D, Y) – valid word, uses common letters.

Pattern _ _ _ _ A:
- R A _ _ A – invalid (A twice)
- _ R _ _ A – R in position 2 is invalid (from arose feedback)
- _ _ R _ A – R in position 3
- _ _ _ R A – R in position 4

Example: B R _ _ A – “BRAGA” (but G and A are ok, but is it a word?)
“BRAGA” is a valid word (a type of skirt).

Another: C R _ _ A – “CRANK” (has N, out)
“CRUST” (S, out)
“CRISP” (S, out)
“CRUEL” (E, out)
“CRANE” (E, out)
“CRAMP” (P ok, but M ok) – “CRAMP” has A in 4, R in 2 (invalid)

“BRAND” (N out)
“BRAND” – N is out
“BRAGA” seems best so far.

But “BRAGA” has A in 5, R in 2 (invalid). So invalid.

Let’s try A in 4:
Pattern _ _ _ A R:
- B A R D Y – but A is 2, not 4
- C A R D S – S out
- F A R D Y – A 2
- H A R D Y – A 2
- B A R G E – E out
- C A R V A – A 2
- D A R K – too short
- F A R M – too short
- G A R B – too short
- M A R V – too short

Wait, we need A in 4 and R in 5:
Pattern _ _ _ A R:
- B A R D Y – A is 2
- C A R D S – A 2
- D A R K – too short
- F A R M – too short
- H A R D Y – A 2
- J A R V – too short
- L A R G – too short
- M A R V – too short
- P A R K – A 2
- V A R M – too short
- W A R M – A 2
- Y A R D – A 2

Hmm, none of these have A in 4. Let’s try A in 5:
Pattern _ _ _ _ A:
- R _ _ _ A – R in 1
- _ R _ _ A – R in 2 (invalid)
- _ _ R _ A – R in 3
- _ _ _ R A – R in 4

Example:
- R A _ _ A – A 2,4 (invalid)
- _ R A _ A – A 3,5 (invalid)
- _ _ R A A – A 4,5 (invalid)
- _ _ _ R A – A 5, R 4

Valid words:
- B R U R A – not common
- C R U R A – not common
- F R U R A – not common
- G R U R A – not common
- H R U R A – not common
- J R U R A – not common
- M R U R A – not common
- P R U R A – not common
- V R U R A – not common
- W R U R A – not common

This is tricky. Let’s try a different approach: list words with A and R, no O/S/E/T/I/N, and A in 4 or 5.

Remaining letters: A, R plus any of B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- B R A D Y – A 3 (invalid)
- C R A V A – A 3
- D R A G – too short
- F R A G – too short
- G R A M – too short
- H A R D – A 2
- J A R V – too short
- K A R T – T out
- L A R G – too short
- M A R V – too short
- P A R K – A 2
- V A R M – too short
- W A R M – A 2
- Y A R D – A 2

Wait, none of these have A in 4 or 5. Let’s try A in 5:
Pattern _ _ _ _ A:

“BRUDA” is not a common word. “CRUDA” is not a word. “F R U D A” – “FRULA” is not a word.

Let me think of actual common words:
- “GRAFT” – has T (out)
- “GRAPE” – has E (out)
- “GRAVY” – Y ok, but A 3
- “GRAIN” – N out
- “GRAFT” – T out
- “GRAPE” – E out
- “GRASP” – S out
- “GRATE” – E out
- “GRIMY” – I out
- “GRIND” – N, I, D – I out, N out
- “GRIND” – N out
- “GRIPS” – S out
- “GRIT” – too short
- “GRUNT” – N, T out
- “GRYPH” – not common
- “GRYPH” – not common

Let me try “GRAVY” – A 3 (invalid)
“GRAVY” – A 3 (invalid)

“CRANK” – N, K ok, but A 3 (invalid)
“CRANK” – A 3 (invalid)

“BRAND” – N out
“BRAND” – N out

“PRANK” – N out
“PRANK” – N out

“DRANK” – N out
“DRANK” – N out

“CRAMP” – A 3 (invalid)
“CRAMP” – A 3 (invalid)

“FRANK” – A 3 (invalid)
“FRANK” – A 3 (invalid)

“GRAMP” – not a word
“GRAMP” – not a word

“GRAPE” – E out
“GRAPE” – E out

“GRAFT” – T out
“GRAFT” – T out

“GRAVY” – A 3 (invalid)
“GRAVY” – A 3 (invalid)

“GRAVY” – A 3 (invalid)

This is harder than expected. Let me try “R A _ _ A” – but A 2 invalid.

Let me try “R _ _ _ A” – R 1:
- R A B Y A – not a word
- R A C Y A – not a word
- R A D Y A – not a word
- R A F A – too short
- R A G A – too short
- R A H A – too short

- R A U A – too short
- R A V A – too short
- R A W A – too short
- R A X A – too short
- R A Y A – too short
- R A Z A – too short

No luck. Let me try “_ R _ _ A” – R 2 invalid.

Let me try “_ _ R _ A” – R 3:
- B R A D A – A 3 (invalid)
- C R A D A – A 3 (invalid)
- D R A D A – A 3 (invalid)
- F R A D A – A 3 (invalid)
- G R A D A – A 3 (invalid)

- P R A D A – A 3 (invalid)
- V R A D A – A 3 (invalid)
- W R A D A – A 3 (invalid)
- Y R A D A – A 3 (invalid)

No good.

Let me try “_ _ _ R A” – R 4:
- B A R D A – A 2 (invalid)
- C A R D A – A 2 (invalid)
- D A R D A – A 2 (invalid)
- F A R D A – A 2 (invalid)

- P A R D A – A 2 (invalid)
- V A R D A – A 2 (invalid)
- W A R D A – A 2 (invalid)
- Y A R D A – A 2 (invalid)

No good.

Let me try “_ _ _ A R” – A 4:
- B U A R D – not a word
- C U A R D – not a word
- D U A R D – not a word
- F U A R D – not a word
- G U A R D – G, U, A, R, D – all allowed, common word “GUARD”
- H U A R D – not a word
- J U A R D – not a word
- K U A R D – not a word
- L U A R D – not a word
- M U A R D – not a word
- P U A R D – not a word
- V U A R D – not a word
- W U A R D – not a word
- Y U A R D – not a word

“GUARD” is a valid word, fits:
- G, U, A, R, D – none are O, S, E, T, I, N
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- R is in position 5 (allowed)
- No other letters ruled out

This seems to be the best candidate.Based on the feedback, the word must contain A and R, cannot have O, S, E, T, I, N, and A must be in position 4 or 5 while R must be elsewhere. The word ""GUARD"" fits these constraints perfectly.

From all feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word: A, R  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N, G, U, D  

Positions ruled out:
- A is NOT in positions 1, 3, 4 → must be in position 2 or 5.
- R is NOT in positions 2, 3, 4 → must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and R exactly once each.
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool: {A, R} ∪ {B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.
- Places A in position 2 or 5.
- Places R in position 1, 2, or 5 (but not conflicting with A).

Let’s list possible patterns:

Pattern 1: A in position 2 → _ A _ _ _
   Then R must be in 1, 4, or 5.
   - R A _ _ _  → R in 1, A in 2
   - _ A _ _ R
   - _ A _ R _

Pattern 2: A in position 5 → _ _ _ _ A
   Then R must be in 1 or 3 or 4 (since 2 is also possible but we’d have R A _ _ A which would place A twice, impossible).
   - R _ _ _ A
   - _ _ R _ A
   - _ _ _ R A

Now scan for common English words fitting these patterns using allowed letters.

Pattern 1: R A _ _ _

<guess>harry</guess>",harry,"From all feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word: A, R  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N, G, U, D  

Positions ruled out:
- A is NOT in positions 1, 3, 4 → must be in position 2 or 5.
- R is NOT in positions 2, 3, 4 → must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and R exactly once each.
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool: {A, R} ∪ {B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.
- Places A in position 2 or 5.
- Places R in position 1, 2, or 5 (but not conflicting with A).

Let’s list possible patterns:

Pattern 1: A in position 2 → _ A _ _ _
   Then R must be in 1, 4, or 5.
   - R A _ _ _  → R in 1, A in 2
   - _ A _ _ R
   - _ A _ R _

Pattern 2: A in position 5 → _ _ _ _ A
   Then R must be in 1 or 3 or 4 (since 2 is also possible but we’d have R A _ _ A which would place A twice, impossible).
   - R _ _ _ A
   - _ _ R _ A
   - _ _ _ R A

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

Looking at these letters, the word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (very common)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives me a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word, providing useful information for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-)  → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st)
- R(-)  → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd)
- O(x)  → O is not in the word at all
- S(x)  → S is not the word at all
- E(x)  → E is not the word at all

So we know:
1. The word contains A and R somewhere, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
2. The word does NOT contain O, S, or E.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A and R
- Does NOT have O, S, or E
- Places A and R in new positions (not 1st and 2nd)

Good candidates: “train”, “brain”, “fairy”, “carat”, “tarot” (but “tarot” has O which we know is out), “drain”, “grain”, “crank”, etc.

Among these, “train” seems good:
- T, R, A, I, N
- Uses R and A in new positions (R is 2nd, A is 3rd – different from 1st and 2nd in arose)
- No O, S, or E
- Common letters T, I, N give additional info

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: train -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. train → T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T, I, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (already knew that).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (so A must be in position 4 or 5).

Summary of what we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, R
- Positions:
  – A is not in 1, 3 → must be in 4 or 5.
  – R is not in 2 → could be 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and R.
- Has A in position 4 or 5.
- Has R in any position except 2.
- Uses only letters that have not been ruled out.

Good remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we want common ones).

Possible patterns:
- If A is in position 4: _ _ _ A R
- If A is in position 5: _ _ _ _ A

Let’s look for common words fitting these patterns.

Pattern _ _ _ A R:
- BARDY (but Y is uncommon)
- CARDS (has S, which is out)
- FARDY (rare)
- HARDY (H, A, R, D, Y) – valid word, uses common letters.

Pattern _ _ _ _ A:
- R A _ _ A – invalid (A twice)
- _ R _ _ A – R in position 2 is invalid (from arose feedback)
- _ _ R _ A – R in position 3
- _ _ _ R A – R in position 4

Example: B R _ _ A – “BRAGA” (but G and A are ok, but is it a word?)
“BRAGA” is a valid word (a type of skirt).

Another: C R _ _ A – “CRANK” (has N, out)
“CRUST” (S, out)
“CRISP” (S, out)
“CRUEL” (E, out)
“CRANE” (E, out)
“CRAMP” (P ok, but M ok) – “CRAMP” has A in 4, R in 2 (invalid)

“BRAND” (N out)
“BRAND” – N is out
“BRAGA” seems best so far.

But “BRAGA” has A in 5, R in 2 (invalid). So invalid.

Let’s try A in 4:
Pattern _ _ _ A R:
- B A R D Y – but A is 2, not 4
- C A R D S – S out
- F A R D Y – A 2
- H A R D Y – A 2
- B A R G E – E out
- C A R V A – A 2
- D A R K – too short
- F A R M – too short
- G A R B – too short
- M A R V – too short

Wait, we need A in 4 and R in 5:
Pattern _ _ _ A R:
- B A R D Y – A is 2
- C A R D S – A 2
- D A R K – too short
- F A R M – too short
- H A R D Y – A 2
- J A R V – too short
- L A R G – too short
- M A R V – too short
- P A R K – A 2
- V A R M – too short
- W A R M – A 2
- Y A R D – A 2

Hmm, none of these have A in 4. Let’s try A in 5:
Pattern _ _ _ _ A:
- R _ _ _ A – R in 1
- _ R _ _ A – R in 2 (invalid)
- _ _ R _ A – R in 3
- _ _ _ R A – R in 4

Example:
- R A _ _ A – A 2,4 (invalid)
- _ R A _ A – A 3,5 (invalid)
- _ _ R A A – A 4,5 (invalid)
- _ _ _ R A – A 5, R 4

Valid words:
- B R U R A – not common
- C R U R A – not common
- F R U R A – not common
- G R U R A – not common
- H R U R A – not common
- J R U R A – not common
- M R U R A – not common
- P R U R A – not common
- V R U R A – not common
- W R U R A – not common

This is tricky. Let’s try a different approach: list words with A and R, no O/S/E/T/I/N, and A in 4 or 5.

Remaining letters: A, R plus any of B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words:
- B R A D Y – A 3 (invalid)
- C R A V A – A 3
- D R A G – too short
- F R A G – too short
- G R A M – too short
- H A R D – A 2
- J A R V – too short
- K A R T – T out
- L A R G – too short
- M A R V – too short
- P A R K – A 2
- V A R M – too short
- W A R M – A 2
- Y A R D – A 2

Wait, none of these have A in 4 or 5. Let’s try A in 5:
Pattern _ _ _ _ A:
- B R U D A – B, R, U, D, A – all allowed, common word.
- C R U D A – C, R, U, D, A – valid.
- F R U D A – F, R, U, D, A – valid.
- G R U D A – G, R, U, D, A – valid.
- H R U D A – H, R, U, D, A – valid.
- J R U D A – J, R, U, D, A – valid.
- M R U D A – M, R, U, D, A – valid.
- P R U D A – P, R, U, D, A – valid.
- V R U D A – V, R, U, D, A – valid.
- W R U D A – W, R, U, D, A – valid.

“BRUDA” is not a common word. “CRUDA” is not a word. “F R U D A” – “FRULA” is not a word.

Let me think of actual common words:
- “GRAFT” – has T (out)
- “GRAPE” – has E (out)
- “GRAVY” – Y ok, but A 3
- “GRAIN” – N out
- “GRAFT” – T out
- “GRAPE” – E out
- “GRASP” – S out
- “GRATE” – E out
- “GRIMY” – I out
- “GRIND” – N, I, D – I out, N out
- “GRIND” – N out
- “GRIPS” – S out
- “GRIT” – too short
- “GRUNT” – N, T out
- “GRYPH” – not common
- “GRYPH” – not common

Let me try “GRAVY” – A 3 (invalid)
“GRAVY” – A 3 (invalid)

“CRANK” – N, K ok, but A 3 (invalid)
“CRANK” – A 3 (invalid)

“BRAND” – N out
“BRAND” – N out

“PRANK” – N out
“PRANK” – N out

“DRANK” – N out
“DRANK” – N out

“CRAMP” – A 3 (invalid)
“CRAMP” – A 3 (invalid)

“FRANK” – A 3 (invalid)
“FRANK” – A 3 (invalid)

“GRAMP” – not a word
“GRAMP” – not a word

“GRAPE” – E out
“GRAPE” – E out

“GRAFT” – T out
“GRAFT” – T out

“GRAVY” – A 3 (invalid)
“GRAVY” – A 3 (invalid)

“GRAVY” – A 3 (invalid)

This is harder than expected. Let me try “R A _ _ A” – but A 2 invalid.

Let me try “R _ _ _ A” – R 1:
- R A B Y A – not a word
- R A C Y A – not a word
- R A D Y A – not a word
- R A F A – too short
- R A G A – too short
- R A H A – too short
- R A J A – too short
- R A K A – too short
- R A L A – too short
- R A M A – too short
- R A P A – too short
- R A Q A – too short
- R A U A – too short
- R A V A – too short
- R A W A – too short
- R A X A – too short
- R A Y A – too short
- R A Z A – too short

No luck. Let me try “_ R _ _ A” – R 2 invalid.

Let me try “_ _ R _ A” – R 3:
- B R A D A – A 3 (invalid)
- C R A D A – A 3 (invalid)
- D R A D A – A 3 (invalid)
- F R A D A – A 3 (invalid)
- G R A D A – A 3 (invalid)
- H R A D A – A 3 (invalid)
- J R A D A – A 3 (invalid)
- K R A D A – A 3 (invalid)
- L R A D A – A 3 (invalid)
- M R A D A – A 3 (invalid)
- P R A D A – A 3 (invalid)
- V R A D A – A 3 (invalid)
- W R A D A – A 3 (invalid)
- Y R A D A – A 3 (invalid)

No good.

Let me try “_ _ _ R A” – R 4:
- B A R D A – A 2 (invalid)
- C A R D A – A 2 (invalid)
- D A R D A – A 2 (invalid)
- F A R D A – A 2 (invalid)
- G A R D A – A 2 (invalid)
- H A R D A – A 2 (invalid)
- J A R D A – A 2 (invalid)
- K A R D A – A 2 (invalid)
- L A R D A – A 2 (invalid)
- M A R D A – A 2 (invalid)
- P A R D A – A 2 (invalid)
- V A R D A – A 2 (invalid)
- W A R D A – A 2 (invalid)
- Y A R D A – A 2 (invalid)

No good.

Let me try “_ _ _ A R” – A 4:
- B U A R D – not a word
- C U A R D – not a word
- D U A R D – not a word
- F U A R D – not a word
- G U A R D – G, U, A, R, D – all allowed, common word “GUARD”
- H U A R D – not a word
- J U A R D – not a word
- K U A R D – not a word
- L U A R D – not a word
- M U A R D – not a word
- P U A R D – not a word
- V U A R D – not a word
- W U A R D – not a word
- Y U A R D – not a word

“GUARD” is a valid word, fits:
- G, U, A, R, D – none are O, S, E, T, I, N
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- R is in position 5 (allowed)
- No other letters ruled out

This seems to be the best candidate.Based on the feedback, the word must contain A and R, cannot have O, S, E, T, I, N, and A must be in position 4 or 5 while R must be elsewhere. The word ""GUARD"" fits these constraints perfectly.

From all feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word: A, R  
Letters known NOT to be in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N, G, U, D  

Positions ruled out:
- A is NOT in positions 1, 3, 4 → must be in position 2 or 5.
- R is NOT in positions 2, 3, 4 → must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and R exactly once each.
- Uses only letters from the remaining pool: {A, R} ∪ {B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.
- Places A in position 2 or 5.
- Places R in position 1, 2, or 5 (but not conflicting with A).

Let’s list possible patterns:

Pattern 1: A in position 2 → _ A _ _ _
   Then R must be in 1, 4, or 5.
   - R A _ _ _  → R in 1, A in 2
   - _ A _ _ R
   - _ A _ R _

Pattern 2: A in position 5 → _ _ _ _ A
   Then R must be in 1 or 3 or 4 (since 2 is also possible but we’d have R A _ _ A which would place A twice, impossible).
   - R _ _ _ A
   - _ _ R _ A
   - _ _ _ R A

Now scan for common English words fitting these patterns using allowed letters.

Pattern 1: R A _ _ _
   - R A B _ _  → “RABID”, “RABBY”, “RABID” (but D is out), “RABBY” (B,Y ok) → “RABBY” is a word.
   - R A C _ _  → “RACCO” (not a word), “RACCOON” too long
   - R A F _ _  → “RAFAL” (not common), “RAFIA” (I out)
   - R A H _ _  → “RAHAT” (not a word)
   - R A K _ _  → “RAKED” (E,D out), “RAKER” (E,R out)
   - R A L _ _  → “RALLY” (L,Y ok), “RALLY” is a word.
   - R A M _ _  → “RAMMY” (M,Y ok), “RAMMY” is a word.
   - R A P _ _  → “RAPID” (I,D out), “RAPID” invalid, “RASPY” (S,P out)
   - R A V _ _  → “RAVED” (E,D out), “RAVEN” (E,N out)
   - R A W _ _  → “RAWLY” (L,Y ok), “RAWLY” is a word.
   - R A Y _ _  → “RAYER” (E,R out), “RAYS” too short

   - C A R _ _  → “CARDS” (S,D out), “CARDS” invalid
   - F A R _ _  → “FARCE” (E,C out), “FARCE” invalid
   - H A R _ _  → “HARRY” (Y ok), “HARRY” is a word.
   - J A R _ _  → “JARDO” (O,D out), “JARDO” invalid
   - K A R _ _  → “KARMA” (M,A ok) → “KARMA”
   - L A R _ _  → “LARRY” (Y ok), “LARRY” is a word.
   - M A R _ _  → “MARRY” (Y ok), “MARRY” is a word.
   - P A R _ _  → “PARAS” (S out), “PAROL” (L ok), “PAROL” not common
   - V A R _ _  → “VAPOR” (O,R out), “VAPID” (I,D out)
   - W A R _ _  → “WARMS” (S,M ok) → “WARMS” (but S is out), invalid

- R(-) → The second R is in the word but in the wrong position (it cannot be in position 4).
- Y(✓) → Y is in the word and in position 5.

So the secret word is H A R _ Y, with the fourth letter being a letter that:
- has not been ruled out (letters already ruled out: O, S, E, T, I, N, G, U, D, plus any others used in prior guesses).
- must not be R (since the second R is already placed in position 3 and the fourth R is marked as wrong position).

The remaining letters to consider for position 4 are from the unused pool: B, C, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and possibly others not yet tested).
