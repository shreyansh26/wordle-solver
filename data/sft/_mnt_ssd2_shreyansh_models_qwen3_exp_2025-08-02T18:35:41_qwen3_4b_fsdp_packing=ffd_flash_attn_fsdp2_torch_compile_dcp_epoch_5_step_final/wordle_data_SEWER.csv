- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Some good starting words include:

- SLATE: covers S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: covers C, R, A, N, E
- ADIEU: covers A, D, I, E, U (lots of vowels)
- RAISE: covers R, A, I, S, E

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a very common starting word that covers several high-frequency letters.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- L, A, T are not in the word at all (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word starts with S
- It contains E somewhere other than position 5
- It does NOT contain L, A, T

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Has E in positions 2, 3, or 4
3. Does not contain L, A, T

Let’s think of words that fit these constraints. Some possibilities:
- SKEIN (but has N, which we haven’t ruled out)
- SHINE (but has H, N)
- SPECK (but has P, C)
- SERUM (but has R, U, M)

A good next guess should introduce new common letters while satisfying the constraints. ""SHINE"" seems promising because:
- Starts with S
- E is in position 4 (allowed)
- Introduces H, I, N
- No L, A, T

Let me check if there are any conflicts:
- S: correct position 1 (✓)
- H: new letter
- I: new letter
- N: new letter
- E: in word but wrong position in SLATE (position 5), so position 4 is fine

This seems like a solid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. Some good starting words include:

- SLATE: covers S, L, A, T, E
- CRANE: covers C, R, A, N, E
- ADIEU: covers A, D, I, E, U (lots of vowels)
- RAISE: covers R, A, I, S, E

I'll go with ""SLATE"" as it's a very common starting word that covers several high-frequency letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1 (✓)
- L, A, T are not in the word at all (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word starts with S
- It contains E somewhere other than position 5
- It does NOT contain L, A, T

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Has E in positions 2, 3, or 4
3. Does not contain L, A, T

Let’s think of words that fit these constraints. Some possibilities:
- SKEIN (but has N, which we haven’t ruled out)
- SHINE (but has H, N)
- SPECK (but has P, C)
- SERUM (but has R, U, M)

A good next guess should introduce new common letters while satisfying the constraints. ""SHINE"" seems promising because:
- Starts with S
- E is in position 4 (allowed)
- Introduces H, I, N
- No L, A, T

Let me check if there are any conflicts:
- S: correct position 1 (✓)
- H: new letter
- I: new letter
- N: new letter
- E: in word but wrong position in SLATE (position 5), so position 4 is fine

This seems like a solid next guess.

2. The word contains E, but E is NOT in positions 4 or 5 (because in both guesses it was marked “-” in those spots).
3. The letters L, A, T, H, I, N are all absent.

So the pattern so far:
S _ _ _ _

And E must appear in position 2 or 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Has E in position 2 or 3
- Uses none of the forbidden letters (L, A, T, H, I, N)

Let’s list possible candidates:

- S E _ _ _  (E in position 2)
  – SCARE – but A is forbidden
  – SCREE – has E in position 5 (forbidden)
  – SEDGE – has D and G (both allowed)
  – SEWER – has W and R (both allowed)
  – SENSE – has N (forbidden)

- S _ E _ _  (E in position 3)
  – SMELT – has L and T (forbidden)
  – SPEAR – has A (forbidden)
  – SPORE – has P, O, R (all allowed)
  – SPECK – has P, C, K (all allowed)

Between these, “SPORE” and “SPECK” both fit the constraints and introduce new common letters (O, R or P, C, K). “SPORE” seems slightly more common.

3. Does not contain L, A, T

Let’s think of words that fit these constraints. Some possibilities:
- SKEIN (but has N, which we haven’t ruled out)
- SHINE (but has H, N)
- SPECK (but has P, C)
- SERUM (but has R, U, M)

A good next guess should introduce new common letters while satisfying the constraints. ""SHINE"" seems promising because:
- Starts with S
- E is in position 4 (allowed)
- Introduces H, I, N
- No L, A, T

Let me check if there are any conflicts:
- S: correct position 1 (✓)
- H: new letter
- I: new letter
- N: new letter
- E: in word but wrong position in SLATE (position 5), so position 4 is fine

This seems like a solid next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: SHINE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) I(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. S is locked in position 1.
2. The word contains E, but E is NOT in positions 4 or 5 (because in both guesses it was marked “-” in those spots).
3. The letters L, A, T, H, I, N are all absent.

So the pattern so far:
S _ _ _ _

And E must appear in position 2 or 3.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Has E in position 2 or 3
- Uses none of the forbidden letters (L, A, T, H, I, N)

Let’s list possible candidates:

- S E _ _ _  (E in position 2)
  – SCARE – but A is forbidden
  – SCREE – has E in position 5 (forbidden)
  – SEDGE – has D and G (both allowed)
  – SEWER – has W and R (both allowed)
  – SENSE – has N (forbidden)

- S _ E _ _  (E in position 3)
  – SMELT – has L and T (forbidden)
  – SPEAR – has A (forbidden)
  – SPORE – has P, O, R (all allowed)
  – SPECK – has P, C, K (all allowed)

Between these, “SPORE” and “SPECK” both fit the constraints and introduce new common letters (O, R or P, C, K). “SPORE” seems slightly more common.

Let’s go with SPORE.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: SHINE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) I(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 3: SPORE -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(x) O(x) R(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

1. S is fixed in position 1 (✓).
2. The word contains E, but E is NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (because it was marked “-” in positions 4 and 5 in SPORE and earlier in positions 4 and 5 in SHINE and SLATE).  
   Therefore, E must be in position 2.
3. Forbidden letters so far: L, A, T, H, I, N, P, O.
4. R is in the word but NOT in position 4 (because it was marked “-” in position 4 in SPORE).

So the pattern is now:
S E _ _ _

and R must appear in position 3 or 5.

Possible words:
- S E R _ _  (R in position 3)
  – SERUM – has U and M (both allowed)
  – SERFS – has F twice (allowed)
  – SEREN – has N (forbidden)
  – SERED – has D (allowed)

- S E _ _ R  (R in position 5)
  – SEWER – has W and E again (but E already in position 2)
  – SEVER – has V (allowed)
  – SECRER – not a valid word
  – SEBIR – not a valid word

Between SERUM and SEVER, SERUM is a common word. Let’s try SERUM.

Check constraints:
- S ✓, E ✓ in position 2, R in position 3 (allowed), U and M not forbidden.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after four guesses.

1. S is locked in position 1 (✓).
2. E is locked in position 2 (✓).
3. R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (because it was marked “-” in SERUM, position 3).
4. Forbidden letters so far: L, A, T, H, I, N, P, O, U, M.
5. Positions 3, 4, 5 must be filled with letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding the forbidden set).

We need a 5-letter word of the form:
S E _ _ _

with R somewhere in positions 4 or 5 (since it can’t be in 3).

Possible patterns:
- S E _ R _
- S E _ _ R

Let’s list valid English words that fit:

- S E C R _  → SECUR (not a word)  
- S E C _ R  → SECAR (not a word), SECER (not a word)  
- S E D R _  → SEDAR (not a word)  
- S E D _ R  → SEDER (not a word)  
- S E G _ R  → SEGER (not a word)  
- S E K _ R  → SEKIR (not a word)  
- S E V _ R  → SEVER (valid word)  
- S E V R _  → SEVRE (not a word)  
- S E W _ R  → SOWER (but O is forbidden)  
- S E Y _ R  → SEYR (not a word)  

The only valid word that fits all constraints is **SEVER**.

Check:
- S(✓) E(✓) V (new) E (already placed) R (in word, position 5 allowed).
- No forbidden letters used.

Therefore, the next logical guess is **SEVER**.
