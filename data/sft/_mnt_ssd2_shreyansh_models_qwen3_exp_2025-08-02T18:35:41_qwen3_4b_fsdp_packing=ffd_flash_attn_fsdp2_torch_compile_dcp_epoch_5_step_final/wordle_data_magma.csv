For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This will help me gather maximum information about which letters are in the secret word. A common strategy is to use words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" as they contain frequently used letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x) : R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A (but not in position 1).
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A somewhere in positions 2-5.
2. Avoids R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U, Y (since A is already used and O/E are out).

A strong second guess should include A plus other common letters. ""PLAID"" is a good candidate because it has A (not in position 1), and uses P, L, I, D which are common and haven't been tested yet. Another option is ""CHALK"" but ""PLAID"" seems slightly better.

Summary of what we know so far:

Letters not in the word at all: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D  
Letters confirmed to be in the word but not yet in the correct spot: A (and it is not in positions 1, 3)

So the secret word:
- Contains A, but A is NOT in position 1 or position 3.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tested yet:
Vowels: U, Y (A already known)
Consonants: T, N, C, M, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A in position 2, 4, or 5 (since positions 1 and 3 are ruled out).
2. Uses only letters from the remaining pool.

A good next guess should test several new common letters while placing A in a new position.  
Let’s try a word like “CATCH” – but C is repeated and we don’t know about C yet.  
Another option is “MOUNT” – but O is already ruled out.  
“BANKY” – B, N, K, Y are new letters and A is in position 2.  
“CABBY” – C, B, Y are new, A is in position 2.  
“GUMMY” – G, U, M, Y are new, A is not used here (bad).  
“TUBA” – only 4 letters.  
“MACHO” – O is out.  
“BANCY” – B, N, C, Y are new, A is in position 2.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This will help me gather maximum information about which letters are in the secret word. A common strategy is to use words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" as they contain frequently used letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x) : R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A (but not in position 1).
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A somewhere in positions 2-5.
2. Avoids R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U, Y (since A is already used and O/E are out).

A strong second guess should include A plus other common letters. ""PLAID"" is a good candidate because it has A (not in position 1), and uses P, L, I, D which are common and haven't been tested yet. Another option is ""CHALK"" but ""PLAID"" seems slightly better.

Let's go with PLAID.

Summary of what we know so far:

Letters not in the word at all: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D  
Letters confirmed to be in the word but not yet in the correct spot: A (and it is not in positions 1, 3)

So the secret word:
- Contains A, but A is NOT in position 1 or position 3.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tested yet:
Vowels: U, Y (A already known)
Consonants: T, N, C, M, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A in position 2, 4, or 5 (since positions 1 and 3 are ruled out).
2. Uses only letters from the remaining pool.

A good next guess should test several new common letters while placing A in a new position.  
Let’s try a word like “CATCH” – but C is repeated and we don’t know about C yet.  
Another option is “MOUNT” – but O is already ruled out.  
“BANKY” – B, N, K, Y are new letters and A is in position 2.  
“CABBY” – C, B, Y are new, A is in position 2.  
“GUMMY” – G, U, M, Y are new, A is not used here (bad).  
“TUBA” – only 4 letters.  
“MACHO” – O is out.  
“BANCY” – B, N, C, Y are new, A is in position 2.

“BANCY” looks good: tests B, N, C, Y and places A in position 2.

So the word pattern is: _ A _ _ _ with G and M somewhere in the remaining slots.

Remaining unused common letters: F, H, K, V, W, X, Z (plus G and M must be placed)

We need a valid 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2
- G and M somewhere (but not in positions already ruled out)
- Only letters from the allowed set

Possible positions for G and M:
- G can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5
- M can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not same position as G)

Let’s list possible words:
- G A M _ _ → GAM_ _ : GAMER (E out), GAMMA (M twice, but M already used once), GAMUT (U,T out)
- _ A G M _ → _AGM_ : F, H, K, V, W, X, Z available

- _ A _ G M → _A_GM : same issue, no common words
- _ A M G _ → _AM_G : same issue
- _ A _ M G → _A_MG : same issue

Looking at the remaining letters, the only common word that fits is ""GAMMA"" but M appears twice and we don't know if M can repeat. Since we have no info on repeats, it's safer to try a word with distinct letters.

Next possible word: ""GAMAS"" – but S is ruled out. ""GAMBO"" – O ruled out. ""GAMMY"" – Y ruled out. 

Wait, let's try ""GAMAS"" – no, S is out. ""GAMBA"" – B is out. 

Looking at the remaining letters, the only valid word seems to be ""GAMMA"" but it repeats M. Since we have no evidence against repeats, and we need to place G and M, let's try ""GAMMA"".

But let's check if any other word fits. Another possibility is ""GAMAS"" – no. 

Actually, let's try ""GAMMA"" – it uses G, A, M, M, A. Since A is already confirmed and we have no info on M's position, it might be possible.

But let's think of simpler words. The only common word left is ""GAMMA"" but it's not very common. 

Another approach: since G and M must be in the word, and positions 1,3,4,5 are open, let's try ""GAMMY"" – but Y is out. 

Looking back, the only possible word seems to be ""GAMMA"" but it's a bit of a stretch. 

Wait, let's try ""GAMAS"" – no. 

Actually, let's try ""GAMMA"" as it's the only word that uses G and M in valid positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This will help me gather maximum information about which letters are in the secret word. A common strategy is to use words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" as they contain frequently used letters. I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), giving me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) : A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first).
- R(x), O(x), S(x), E(x) : R, O, S, E are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A (but not in position 1).
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A somewhere in positions 2-5.
2. Avoids R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U, Y (since A is already used and O/E are out).

A strong second guess should include A plus other common letters. ""PLAID"" is a good candidate because it has A (not in position 1), and uses P, L, I, D which are common and haven't been tested yet. Another option is ""CHALK"" but ""PLAID"" seems slightly better.

Let's go with PLAID.

Summary of what we know so far:

Letters not in the word at all: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D  
Letters confirmed to be in the word but not yet in the correct spot: A (and it is not in positions 1, 3)

So the secret word:
- Contains A, but A is NOT in position 1 or position 3.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tested yet:
Vowels: U, Y (A already known)
Consonants: T, N, C, M, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A in position 2, 4, or 5 (since positions 1 and 3 are ruled out).
2. Uses only letters from the remaining pool.

A good next guess should test several new common letters while placing A in a new position.  
Let’s try a word like “CATCH” – but C is repeated and we don’t know about C yet.  
Another option is “MOUNT” – but O is already ruled out.  
“BANKY” – B, N, K, Y are new letters and A is in position 2.  
“CABBY” – C, B, Y are new, A is in position 2.  
“GUMMY” – G, U, M, Y are new, A is not used here (bad).  
“TUBA” – only 4 letters.  
“MACHO” – O is out.  
“BANCY” – B, N, C, Y are new, A is in position 2.

“BANCY” looks good: tests B, N, C, Y and places A in position 2.

From the feedback so far:

- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D, B, N, C, Y  
- Letters confirmed IN the word: A (and it is in the correct position 2)

So the secret word looks like: _ A _ _ _

We need a 5-letter word with A in the second position and only letters from the unused pool.  
Remaining common letters not yet tested: T, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, F, J, Q, X, Z (but we’ll stick to the most common).

Good candidates:
- G A U N T (G, U, N, T – but N is already ruled out)
- T A R G E T (R, E, T – R and E are ruled out)
- M A C H O (M, C, H, O – C and O ruled out)
- G A M E S (G, M, E, S – E, S ruled out)
- T A U N T (T, U, N – N ruled out)
- F A U N T (F, U, N – N ruled out)
- V A U G H (V, U, G, H – all new)

“VAUGH” is a valid word (variant spelling of “vaunt”), but let’s pick a more common word instead.  
“GAULT” uses G, U, L – but L is ruled out.  
“GAUNT” uses G, U, N – N is ruled out.  
“GAZED” uses G, Z, E, D – E and D ruled out.  
“GAUZE” uses G, Z, E – E ruled out.  
“GAULS” uses G, L, S – L and S ruled out.  
“GAUDY” uses G, U, D, Y – D and Y ruled out.

Let’s try “GAMUT” – G, M, U, T are all new and A is in position 2.  
GAMUT is a valid word meaning the range of musical pitches.

So the next guess is GAMUT.

From all feedback so far:

- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D, B, N, C, Y, U, T  
- Letters confirmed IN the word: A (position 2) and G (somewhere) and M (somewhere)

So the word pattern is: _ A _ _ _ with G and M somewhere in the remaining slots.

Remaining unused common letters: F, H, K, V, W, X, Z (plus G and M must be placed)

We need a valid 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2
- G and M somewhere (but not in positions already ruled out)
- Only letters from the allowed set

Possible positions for G and M:
- G can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5
- M can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5 (but not same position as G)

Let’s list possible words:
- G A M _ _ → GAM_ _ : GAMER (E out), GAMMA (M twice, but M already used once), GAMUT (U,T out)
- _ A G M _ → _AGM_ : F, H, K, V, W, X, Z available
  - FAGM_ : FAGMY (not a word)
  - HAGM_ : HAGMY (not a word)
  - KAGM_ : KAGMY (not a word)
  - VAGM_ : VAGMY (not a word)
  - WAGM_ : WAGMY (not a word)
  - XAGM_ : XAGMY (not a word)
  - ZAGM_ : ZAGMY (not a word)
- _ A _ G M → _A_GM : same issue, no common words
- _ A M G _ → _AM_G : same issue
- _ A _ M G → _A_MG : same issue

Looking at the remaining letters, the only common word that fits is ""GAMMA"" but M appears twice and we don't know if M can repeat. Since we have no info on repeats, it's safer to try a word with distinct letters.

Next possible word: ""GAMAS"" – but S is ruled out. ""GAMBO"" – O ruled out. ""GAMMY"" – Y ruled out. 

Wait, let's try ""GAMAS"" – no, S is out. ""GAMBA"" – B is out. 

Looking at the remaining letters, the only valid word seems to be ""GAMMA"" but it repeats M. Since we have no evidence against repeats, and we need to place G and M, let's try ""GAMMA"".

But let's check if any other word fits. Another possibility is ""GAMAS"" – no. 

Actually, let's try ""GAMMA"" – it uses G, A, M, M, A. Since A is already confirmed and we have no info on M's position, it might be possible.

But let's think of simpler words. The only common word left is ""GAMMA"" but it's not very common. 

Another approach: since G and M must be in the word, and positions 1,3,4,5 are open, let's try ""GAMMY"" – but Y is out. 

Looking back, the only possible word seems to be ""GAMMA"" but it's a bit of a stretch. 

Wait, let's try ""GAMAS"" – no. 

Actually, let's try ""GAMMA"" as it's the only word that uses G and M in valid positions. 

But let me check if there's a better word. The word ""GAMMA"" is valid and uses G and M. 

So the next guess is GAMMA.

- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D, B, N, C, Y, U, T

  – M is in position 4 (M(✓) in GAMMA)
  – A is in position 2 (A(✓) in GAMMA)
  – The last A (position 5) is also (✓), so the word ends in A.

So the pattern is: _ A _ M A

Letters still unused (from the allowed set): F, H, K, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits _ A _ M A with one of these letters in position 1.

Possible words:
- F A M M A (invalid, double M)
- H A M M A (invalid, double M)
- K A M M A (invalid, double M)
- V A M M A (invalid, double M)
- W A M M A (invalid, double M)
- X A M M A (invalid, double M)
- Z A M M A (invalid, double M)

Wait, the word must be _ A _ M A, so position 3 is M, but we already have M in position 4. This seems impossible because M can't appear twice unless the word has double M, but we have no evidence of that. 

Let me re-examine the feedback:
GAMMA -> G(-) A(✓) M(-) M(✓) A(✓)

This means:
- Position 1: G is in the word but not here (-)
- Position 2: A is correct (✓)
- Position 3: M is in the word but not here (-)
- Position 4: M is correct (✓)
- Position 5: A is correct (✓)

So the word is _ A _ M A, with G somewhere in positions 2-5, but position 2 is A, 4 is M, 5 is A, so G must be in position 3. But position 3 was marked (-), meaning M is in the word but not here. This is a contradiction unless the word has double M.

But the feedback shows M in position 4 is correct (✓), so the word must be _ A M M A. The only letter left is position 1, which must be from the allowed set: F, H, K, V, W, X, Z.

The valid word is ""FAMMA"" (not common), ""HAMMA"" (not common), ""KAMMA"" (not common), etc. The most plausible seems ""KAMMA"" but it's obscure. 

However, looking at the letters, ""KAMMA"" is actually a valid word (plural of ""kammah""). 

But let me check if there's a better word. The word ""GAMMA"" itself was already tried, so the next logical word is ""KAMMA"".

So the next guess is KAMMA.

However, looking at the letters, ""KAMMA"" is actually a valid word (plural of ""kammah""). 

But let me check if there's a better word. The word ""GAMMA"" itself was already tried, so the next logical word is ""KAMMA"".

So the next guess is KAMMA.",Guess 6: KAMMA -> FEEDBACK: K(x) A(✓) M(-) M(✓) A(✓),FAIL
