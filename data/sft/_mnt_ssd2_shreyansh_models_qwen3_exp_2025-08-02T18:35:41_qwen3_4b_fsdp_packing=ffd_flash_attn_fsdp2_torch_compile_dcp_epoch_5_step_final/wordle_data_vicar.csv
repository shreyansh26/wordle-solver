### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. ""SLATE"" is a popular starting word because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, N, K  
Letters that ARE in the word but are in the wrong positions: C, R, A

So the secret word:
- Contains the letters C, R, A (each in some position other than the one guessed).
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E, N, K.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses C, R, A (but not in their previous positions: C not 1st, R not 2nd, A not 3rd).
- Avoids S, L, T, E, N, K.
- Uses two more distinct letters (not yet tested or already ruled out).

Good remaining common letters to test: D, M, P, O, I, U, H, G, B, F, etc.

Let’s try to place C, R, A in new positions and add two fresh letters.

One promising candidate is “CARDS”:
- C is now 2nd (was 1st → allowed).
- A is now 1st (was 3rd → allowed).
- R is now 3rd (was 2nd → allowed).
- D and S are new letters. However, S is already ruled out (x in SLATE), so CARDS is invalid.

Next option: “PRADA” – but A is repeated and P/R/A are all new positions, yet A is already known to be present once. Also, D is untested but A is repeated, which might not be optimal.

Better: “CRAZY” – but Z is untested and Y is untested, but we already know C/R/A are in the word.

Another candidate: “CRAMP” – but M and P are new, and C/R/A are in new positions. However, P is untested and M is untested.

Wait, let’s focus on using only allowed letters and satisfying the constraints:

We must include C, R, A in different positions:
- C cannot be 1st.
- R cannot be 2nd.
- A cannot be 3rd.

Possible positions:
C: 2,3,4,5  
R: 1,3,4,5  
A: 1,2,4,5  

Let’s try “C” in 2nd, “A” in 4th, “R” in 1st: R A _ C _  
Need two more letters from remaining pool (avoid S,L,T,E,N,K). Good letters: D, M, P, O, I, U, H, G, B, F.

Let’s pick D and M: R A D C M → “RADCM” – not a valid word.

Try “C” 2nd, “A” 1st, “R” 3rd: A C R _ _  
Need two more letters. Let’s try “A C R I D” → “ACRID” – valid word, uses A,C,R,I,D.

Check constraints:
- Contains A (1st, allowed), C (2nd, allowed), R (3rd, allowed).
- I and D are new letters.
- No S,L,T,E,N,K.

“ACRID” looks valid.

Alternative: “CARDS” was invalid due to S. “CARGO” – but G and O are new, but R is 2nd (was 2nd in CRANK → invalid).

Another: “C” 3rd, “A” 2nd, “R” 1st: R A _ C _  
Same as above, “RADCM” invalid.

Better: “C” 3rd, “A” 1st, “R” 2nd: A R C _ _  
Need two more letters. “AROMA” – but O and M are new, but A is repeated (already known once) and A is 5th (allowed). However, A is repeated, which might not be optimal.

“AROMA” is valid but has a repeat A.

- I and D are new letters.
- No S,L,T,E,N,K.

“ACRID” looks valid.

Alternative: “CARDS” was invalid due to S. “CARGO” – but G and O are new, but R is 2nd (was 2nd in CRANK → invalid).

Another: “C” 3rd, “A” 2nd, “R” 1st: R A _ C _  
Same as above, “RADCM” invalid.

Better: “C” 3rd, “A” 1st, “R” 2nd: A R C _ _  
Need two more letters. “AROMA” – but O and M are new, but A is repeated (already known once) and A is 5th (allowed). However, A is repeated, which might not be optimal.

“AROMA” is valid but has a repeat A.

“ACRID” seems better as it has no repeats and uses new letters.

So I’ll go with “ACRID”.

From all feedback so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, N, K, D  
Letters that ARE in the word but are in the wrong positions: A, C, R, I  

So the secret word contains the four letters A, C, R, I, and one additional letter that is not any of S, L, T, E, N, K, D.  
The additional letter must be chosen from the remaining common letters: B, F, G, H, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Positions we know:
- A is not in position 1, 2, or 3 (from SLATE, CRANK, ACRID feedback).
- C is not in position 1, 2, or 3 (from CRANK, ACRID feedback).
- R is not in position 2 or 3 (from CRANK, ACRID feedback).
- I is not in position 4 (from ACRID feedback).

Let’s list possible positions for each letter:
- A: positions 4 or 5
- C: positions 3, 4, or 5
- R: positions 1, 4, or 5
- I: positions 1, 2, 3, or 5

We need to place A, C, R, I plus one extra letter in the 5-letter word, ensuring no conflicts and using only allowed letters.

One systematic way is to try to place A in position 4 and see what happens.

Let’s try:
- Position 4: A
- Then C, R, I must go in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (but R cannot be in 3, I cannot be in 5 if we want to avoid repeats).

Alternative: place A in position 5.
Then C, R, I must go in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 with constraints:
- C not 1,2,3 → must be 4
- R not 2,3 → could be 1 or 4
- I not 4 → could be 1,2,3

So:
- Position 4: C
- Position 5: A
- Then R and I must go in 1,2,3 with R not 2,3 → R must be 1, I and remaining letter in 2,3.

Let’s try:
- 1: R
- 2: I
- 3: ?
We need one more letter (must be from allowed set: B, F, G, H, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.)

Let’s pick a common letter like M:
Word would be R I C M A → ""RIMCA"" – not valid.

Swap positions:
- 1: R
- 3: I
- 2: ?
- 4: C
- 5: A
→ R _ I C A → ""R I C A"" – need a letter in 2. Let’s pick M: R M I C A → ""RMICA"" – invalid.

Alternative: place I in 2, R in 1, C in 4, A in 5:
R I _ C A → need letter in 3. Pick M: R I M C A → ""RIMCA"" – invalid.

Another approach: place C in 3 (since it can be 3,4,5 and 3 is allowed for C).
Then:
- 3: C
- A must be 4 or 5
- R must be 1,4,5
- I must be 1,2,3,5 (but 3 is C, so 1,2,5)

Let’s try:
- 3: C
- 4: A
- Then R must be 1 or 5
- I must be 1,2,5

Case 1: R in 1, I in 2:
Word: R I C A _ → need 5th letter. Pick M: R I C A M → ""RICAM"" – invalid.

Case 2: R in 1, I in 5:
Word: R _ C A I → need 2nd letter. Pick M: R M C A I → ""RMCAI"" – invalid.

Case 3: R in 5, I in 1:
Word: I _ C A R → need 2nd letter. Pick M: I M C A R → ""IMCAR"" – invalid.

Case 4: R in 5, I in 2:
Word: _ I C A R → need 1st letter. Pick M: M I C A R → ""MICAR"" – valid word!

Check constraints:
- Letters: M, I, C, A, R
- All letters are allowed (M is new, others are known to be in word)
- Positions:
  - A is 4 (allowed)
  - C is 3 (allowed)
  - R is 5 (allowed)
  - I is 2 (allowed)
- No conflicts with previous feedback.

Thus, ""MICAR"" is a valid guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. ""SLATE"" is a popular starting word because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives me a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are not in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.
- Does contain A, but not in the 3rd position.

I want a new guess that:
1. Uses A in a different position (not 3rd).
2. Avoids S, L, T, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information gain.

A good candidate is ""CRANK"":
- C, R, N, K are common consonants.
- A is in the 2nd position (different from 3rd).
- No S, L, T, E.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, N, K  
Letters that ARE in the word but are in the wrong positions: C, R, A

So the secret word:
- Contains the letters C, R, A (each in some position other than the one guessed).
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E, N, K.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses C, R, A (but not in their previous positions: C not 1st, R not 2nd, A not 3rd).
- Avoids S, L, T, E, N, K.
- Uses two more distinct letters (not yet tested or already ruled out).

Good remaining common letters to test: D, M, P, O, I, U, H, G, B, F, etc.

Let’s try to place C, R, A in new positions and add two fresh letters.

One promising candidate is “CARDS”:
- C is now 2nd (was 1st → allowed).
- A is now 1st (was 3rd → allowed).
- R is now 3rd (was 2nd → allowed).
- D and S are new letters. However, S is already ruled out (x in SLATE), so CARDS is invalid.

Next option: “PRADA” – but A is repeated and P/R/A are all new positions, yet A is already known to be present once. Also, D is untested but A is repeated, which might not be optimal.

Better: “CRAZY” – but Z is untested and Y is untested, but we already know C/R/A are in the word.

Another candidate: “CRAMP” – but M and P are new, and C/R/A are in new positions. However, P is untested and M is untested.

Wait, let’s focus on using only allowed letters and satisfying the constraints:

We must include C, R, A in different positions:
- C cannot be 1st.
- R cannot be 2nd.
- A cannot be 3rd.

Possible positions:
C: 2,3,4,5  
R: 1,3,4,5  
A: 1,2,4,5  

Let’s try “C” in 2nd, “A” in 4th, “R” in 1st: R A _ C _  
Need two more letters from remaining pool (avoid S,L,T,E,N,K). Good letters: D, M, P, O, I, U, H, G, B, F.

Let’s pick D and M: R A D C M → “RADCM” – not a valid word.

Try “C” 2nd, “A” 1st, “R” 3rd: A C R _ _  
Need two more letters. Let’s try “A C R I D” → “ACRID” – valid word, uses A,C,R,I,D.

Check constraints:
- Contains A (1st, allowed), C (2nd, allowed), R (3rd, allowed).
- I and D are new letters.
- No S,L,T,E,N,K.

“ACRID” looks valid.

Alternative: “CARDS” was invalid due to S. “CARGO” – but G and O are new, but R is 2nd (was 2nd in CRANK → invalid).

Another: “C” 3rd, “A” 2nd, “R” 1st: R A _ C _  
Same as above, “RADCM” invalid.

Better: “C” 3rd, “A” 1st, “R” 2nd: A R C _ _  
Need two more letters. “AROMA” – but O and M are new, but A is repeated (already known once) and A is 5th (allowed). However, A is repeated, which might not be optimal.

“AROMA” is valid but has a repeat A.

“ACRID” seems better as it has no repeats and uses new letters.

So I’ll go with “ACRID”.

From all feedback so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, N, K, D  
Letters that ARE in the word but are in the wrong positions: A, C, R, I  

So the secret word contains the four letters A, C, R, I, and one additional letter that is not any of S, L, T, E, N, K, D.  
The additional letter must be chosen from the remaining common letters: B, F, G, H, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Positions we know:
- A is not in position 1, 2, or 3 (from SLATE, CRANK, ACRID feedback).
- C is not in position 1, 2, or 3 (from CRANK, ACRID feedback).
- R is not in position 2 or 3 (from CRANK, ACRID feedback).
- I is not in position 4 (from ACRID feedback).

Let’s list possible positions for each letter:
- A: positions 4 or 5
- C: positions 3, 4, or 5
- R: positions 1, 4, or 5
- I: positions 1, 2, 3, or 5

We need to place A, C, R, I plus one extra letter in the 5-letter word, ensuring no conflicts and using only allowed letters.

One systematic way is to try to place A in position 4 and see what happens.

Let’s try:
- Position 4: A
- Then C, R, I must go in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (but R cannot be in 3, I cannot be in 5 if we want to avoid repeats).

Alternative: place A in position 5.
Then C, R, I must go in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 with constraints:
- C not 1,2,3 → must be 4
- R not 2,3 → could be 1 or 4
- I not 4 → could be 1,2,3

So:
- Position 4: C
- Position 5: A
- Then R and I must go in 1,2,3 with R not 2,3 → R must be 1, I and remaining letter in 2,3.

Let’s try:
- 1: R
- 2: I
- 3: ?
We need one more letter (must be from allowed set: B, F, G, H, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.)

Let’s pick a common letter like M:
Word would be R I C M A → ""RIMCA"" – not valid.

Swap positions:
- 1: R

- 2: ?
- 4: C
- 5: A
→ R _ I C A → ""R I C A"" – need a letter in 2. Let’s pick M: R M I C A → ""RMICA"" – invalid.

Alternative: place I in 2, R in 1, C in 4, A in 5:
R I _ C A → need letter in 3. Pick M: R I M C A → ""RIMCA"" – invalid.

Another approach: place C in 3 (since it can be 3,4,5 and 3 is allowed for C).
Then:
- 3: C
- A must be 4 or 5
- R must be 1,4,5
- I must be 1,2,3,5 (but 3 is C, so 1,2,5)

- Positions:
  - A is 4 (allowed)
  - C is 3 (allowed)
  - R is 5 (allowed)
  - I is 2 (allowed)
- No conflicts with previous feedback.

Thus, ""MICAR"" is a valid guess.

From Guess 4 (MICAR) we now have:

Positions:
1: M (x) – M is NOT in the word.
2: I (✓) – I is in the word and is in position 2.
3: C (✓) – C is in the word and is in position 3.
4: A (✓) – A is in the word and is in position 4.
5: R (✓) – R is in the word and is in position 5.

So the secret word is completely determined except for the first letter.  
We already know the last four letters: I C A R.

The first letter must be a new letter (not yet tested or ruled out).  
Letters already ruled out: S, L, T, E, N, K, D, M.  
We still need a single letter for position 1 that hasn’t been used or ruled out.

Common remaining consonants: B, F, G, H, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form ? I C A R.

Scanning the dictionary:
- B I C A R – invalid (not a word)
- F I C A R – invalid
- G I C A R – invalid
- H I C A R – invalid
- P I C A R – invalid
- W I C A R – invalid
- V I C A R – invalid
- Y I C A R – invalid

Wait, let’s double-check. The only common word that fits ? I C A R is “VICAR” (short for vicarage or vicar, a clergyman).  
V is still allowed (not yet ruled out).

Thus, the secret word must be V I C A R.
