### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should cover as many of these common letters as possible while being a valid English word.

Looking at common starting words, ""SLATE"" is a popular choice because it includes S, L, A, T, E - covering several very common letters. However, ""AROSE"" is another strong option with A, R, O, S, E. Between these, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it includes three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x): O is NOT in the word.
- S(x): S is NOT in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains A, R, and E (each somewhere other than positions 1, 2, and 5 respectively).
- The word does NOT contain O or S.

We need a 5-letter word that uses A, R, E in different positions and avoids O and S. Also, we want to test new common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good next steps:
1. Re-use A, R, E in new positions.
2. Introduce new common consonants like T, N, L, C, etc.
3. Avoid O and S.

A word that fits: ""TREAD"" (T, R, E, A, D)
- Uses R in position 2 (was position 2 before, but feedback said R is not in position 2, so this is invalid).
Next option: ""RAISE"" - but S is excluded.
Next: ""REACT"" - uses E in position 1 (was position 5 before, so this is okay), A in position 2 (was position 1 before, so this is okay), R in position 3 (was position 2 before, so this is okay), C and T are new letters.
This seems valid.

But let me think of another word: ""EARLY"" - but Y is less common.
Another: ""CREAM"" - but M is less common.
Another: ""DREAD"" - D is new, R in position 2 (invalid, was position 2 before).
Another: ""GRAPE"" - G is new, P is new, but A in position 2 (was position 1 before, so this is okay), R in position 3 (was position 2 before, so this is okay), E in position 5 (invalid, was position 5 before).
Another: ""TRIPE"" - T, I, P, E - but I is new, but E in position 5 is invalid.
Another: ""PRIED"" - P, I, D - but E in position 4 (was position 5 before, so this is okay), R in position 2 (invalid, was position 2 before).
Another: ""PRIED"" is invalid for R.
Another: ""PRATE"" - P, R, A, T, E - R in position 2 (invalid), A in position 3 (was position 1 before), E in position 5 (invalid).
Another: ""TAPER"" - T, A, P, E, R - A in position 2 (was position 1 before), E in position 4 (was position 5 before), R in position 5 (was position 2 before) - this seems valid as all positions are new for A, E, R.
But P is new, T is new.

This seems good: ""TAPER"" - uses T, A, P, E, R.
- A is in position 2 (was position 1 before, so this is new position).
- E is in position 4 (was position 5 before, so this is new position).
- R is in position 5 (was position 2 before, so this is new position).
- T and P are new letters.

This seems like a strong next guess.
