### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters in English. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A strong first guess would be a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters. ""AROSE"" is a great choice because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - all of which are very common letters. This will give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep A and R but move them to new positions.
2. Avoid O, S, E.
3. Introduce new common letters to test.

Good new letters to test: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, etc.

A word that satisfies these is ""TRAIN"":
- T, R, A, I, N
- R moves from position 2 to position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2, so this is bad - can't use R in position 2 again).

Better word: ""TRIAD"":
- T, R, I, A, D
- R in position 2 (still bad - feedback said R not in position 2).

Better word: ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A, N, E (but E is excluded).

Better word: ""RADAR"":
- R in position 2 (still bad).

Better word: ""RATIO"":
- O is excluded.

Better word: ""RAINY"":
- R in position 1 (allowed, since feedback only said R not in position 2).
- A in position 2 (allowed, since feedback only said A not in position 1).
- Introduces I, N, Y.

This seems good.

But let's check another: ""RAINS"" - but S is excluded.

""RAINY"" is valid and uses new letters.

Another option: ""RATIO"" - but O is excluded.

""RANCH"" - but H is less common.

""RAINY"" seems best.

Wait, let's check ""RAINY"":
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- I, N, Y are new letters.

This seems optimal.

But let's think of another: ""TARIN"":

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters in English. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A strong first guess would be a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters. ""AROSE"" is a great choice because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - all of which are very common letters. This will give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep A and R but move them to new positions.
2. Avoid O, S, E.
3. Introduce new common letters to test.

Good new letters to test: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, etc.

A word that satisfies these is ""TRAIN"":
- T, R, A, I, N
- R moves from position 2 to position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2, so this is bad - can't use R in position 2 again).

Better word: ""TRIAD"":
- T, R, I, A, D
- R in position 2 (still bad - feedback said R not in position 2).

Better word: ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A, N, E (but E is excluded).

Better word: ""RADAR"":
- R in position 2 (still bad).

Better word: ""RATIO"":
- O is excluded.

Better word: ""RAINY"":
- R in position 1 (allowed, since feedback only said R not in position 2).
- A in position 2 (allowed, since feedback only said A not in position 1).
- Introduces I, N, Y.

This seems good.

But let's check another: ""RAINS"" - but S is excluded.

""RAINY"" is valid and uses new letters.

Another option: ""RATIO"" - but O is excluded.

""RANCH"" - but H is less common.

""RAINY"" seems best.

Wait, let's check ""RAINY"":
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- I, N, Y are new letters.

This seems optimal.

But let's think of another: ""TARIN"":
- T, A, R, I, N
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- Introduces T, I, N.

This is also good.

Between ""RAINY"" and ""TARIN"", ""TARIN"" introduces T, I, N while moving A and R to new positions.

I'll go with ""TARIN"".

Guess 2: tarin -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) R(✓) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>

From the feedback so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. tarin → T(x) A(✓) R(✓) I(x) N(x)
   - A is now confirmed in position 2.
   - R is now confirmed in position 3.
   - T, I, N are not in the word.

So we know:
- Word pattern: _ A R _ _
- Letters not in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N
- Letters still possible: A, R (already placed), plus B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2 and R in position 3.
- Uses only letters not yet excluded (no O, S, E, T, I, N).

Possible candidates:
- B A R _ _  → BARBS (but S is excluded)
- C A R _ _  → CARDS (D and S, S excluded), CAROL (O excluded)
- D A R _ _  → DARTS (T and S excluded)
- F A R _ _  → FARMS (M and S, S excluded)
- G A R _ _  → GARNS (S and N excluded)
- H A R _ _  → HARPS (P and S, S excluded)
- L A R _ _  → LARKS (K and S, S excluded)
- M A R _ _  → MARRY (Y allowed)
- P A R _ _  → PARMS (S excluded)
- U A R _ _  → UARMS (not a valid word)
- W A R _ _  → WARMS (S excluded)
- Y A R _ _  → YARNS (N and S excluded)

Looking at valid words:
- MARRY: M, A, R, R, Y. Uses M and Y, both allowed.
- CARRY: C, A, R, R, Y. Uses C and Y, both allowed.
- FARRY: F, A, R, R, Y. Uses F and Y, both allowed.

""CARRY"" seems like a good choice because C is a common letter and Y is allowed.

Let's verify:
- CARRY: C (new), A (correct position), R (correct position), R (new), Y (new). No excluded letters.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters in English. Some of the most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A strong first guess would be a word that contains several of these high-frequency letters. ""AROSE"" is a great choice because it contains A, R, O, S, and E - all of which are very common letters. This will give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x) → O is NOT in the word
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Next guess should:
1. Keep A and R but move them to new positions.
2. Avoid O, S, E.
3. Introduce new common letters to test.

Good new letters to test: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, etc.

A word that satisfies these is ""TRAIN"":
- T, R, A, I, N
- R moves from position 2 to position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2, so this is bad - can't use R in position 2 again).

Better word: ""TRIAD"":
- T, R, I, A, D
- R in position 2 (still bad - feedback said R not in position 2).

Better word: ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A, N, E (but E is excluded).

Better word: ""RADAR"":
- R in position 2 (still bad).

Better word: ""RATIO"":
- O is excluded.

Better word: ""RAINY"":
- R in position 1 (allowed, since feedback only said R not in position 2).
- A in position 2 (allowed, since feedback only said A not in position 1).
- Introduces I, N, Y.

This seems good.

But let's check another: ""RAINS"" - but S is excluded.

""RAINY"" is valid and uses new letters.

Another option: ""RATIO"" - but O is excluded.

""RANCH"" - but H is less common.

""RAINY"" seems best.

Wait, let's check ""RAINY"":
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- I, N, Y are new letters.

This seems optimal.

But let's think of another: ""TARIN"":
- T, A, R, I, N
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- Introduces T, I, N.

This is also good.

Between ""RAINY"" and ""TARIN"", ""TARIN"" introduces T, I, N while moving A and R to new positions.

I'll go with ""TARIN"".

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. tarin → T(x) A(✓) R(✓) I(x) N(x)
   - A is now confirmed in position 2.
   - R is now confirmed in position 3.
   - T, I, N are not in the word.

So we know:
- Word pattern: _ A R _ _
- Letters not in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N
- Letters still possible: A, R (already placed), plus B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2 and R in position 3.
- Uses only letters not yet excluded (no O, S, E, T, I, N).

Possible candidates:
- B A R _ _  → BARBS (but S is excluded)
- C A R _ _  → CARDS (D and S, S excluded), CAROL (O excluded)

- P A R _ _  → PARMS (S excluded)
- U A R _ _  → UARMS (not a valid word)
- W A R _ _  → WARMS (S excluded)
- Y A R _ _  → YARNS (N and S excluded)

Looking at valid words:
- MARRY: M, A, R, R, Y. Uses M and Y, both allowed.
- CARRY: C, A, R, R, Y. Uses C and Y, both allowed.
- FARRY: F, A, R, R, Y. Uses F and Y, both allowed.

""CARRY"" seems like a good choice because C is a common letter and Y is allowed.

Let's verify:
- CARRY: C (new), A (correct position), R (correct position), R (new), Y (new). No excluded letters.

A (already fixed in position 2),

The only common English 5-letter words that fit the pattern _ARRY are:

- DARRY (non-word)  
- FARRY (non-word)  
- GARRY (proper noun)  
- MARRY (valid)  
- PARRY (valid)  

Between MARRY and PARRY, both use letters not yet excluded.  
Since we have no further constraints, either would be correct, but MARRY is more common.

Therefore, MARRY is the logical next guess.
