For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should contain several of these letters while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - but this uses D and U which are less common
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) - uses 5 very common letters

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid English word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should contain several of these letters while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - but this uses D and U which are less common
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) - uses 5 very common letters

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid English word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 3).
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains O, but not in position 3.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O somewhere other than position 3.
- No A, R, S, E.

Good letters to try next: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, etc.

A strategic word would use common remaining letters while placing O in a different position. Let's try ""POINT"":
- P, O, I, N, T
- O is in position 2 (not 3), and none of A, R, S, E are used.

- I(x) → I is NOT in the word.
- N(-) → N is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 4).
- T(x) → T is NOT in the word.

Summary so far:
- Letters in the word: O (position 2), N (somewhere else).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, T.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2.
- N somewhere other than position 4.
- No A, R, S, E, P, I, T.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y.

Let's try to form a word:
- Position 2 is O.
- N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- We need valid combinations.

Possible words:
- CONDO: but D is allowed, but we have O twice (position 2 and 5) - but we don't know if O repeats.
- MONEY: but we have N and O, and E is excluded.
- HONKY: K is allowed, but Y is allowed, but H is allowed.
- FOGGY: but G is allowed, but we have O in position 2 and G in 3 and 5.
- BONNY: N is in position 1 and 4 (but 4 is wrong for N), so 4 is invalid.
- DONAL: but A is excluded.
- GONAD: but A and D are allowed? A is excluded.
- HONED: E is excluded.
- LONER: E and R are excluded.
- WONKY: W, O, N, K, Y - all letters allowed (no excluded ones), and N is in position 3 (not 4), O in position 2.

""WONKY"" seems valid:
- W: allowed
- O: position 2 (correct)
- N: position 3 (not 4, so allowed)
- K: allowed

- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- U(x) → U is NOT in the word.
- N(-) → N is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 4).
- D(-) → D is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 5).

Summary so far:
- Correct positions: O in position 2.
- N is in the word but NOT in position 3 or 4 (from previous and current feedback).
- D is in the word but NOT in position 5.
- Excluded letters: A, R, S, E, P, I, T, W, K, Y, B, U.

Letters still allowed: C, F, G, H, L, M, V.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2.
- N somewhere in positions 1, 5 (since 3 and 4 are excluded).
- D somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4 (since 5 is excluded).
- No other excluded letters.

Possible patterns:
- N O _ _ D  (N in 1, D in 5 - but D cannot be in 5, so invalid)
- _ O N _ D  (N in 3 - but N cannot be in 3, so invalid)
- _ O _ N D  (N in 4 - but N cannot be in 4, so invalid)
- _ O D N _  (D in 3, N in 4 - N cannot be in 4, invalid)

- N O _ D _  (N in 1, D in 4 - fits: positions 1=N, 2=O, 4=D)

So two possible patterns:
1. _ O _ D N
2. N O _ D _

Possible combinations:

   - N O _ _ D → N is in 1, O in 2, D in 5 - but D cannot be in 5 (from feedback), so invalid.

2. _ O _ _ N

- D(-) means D is in the word but NOT in position 5

We already know:
- N cannot be in 3 (from WONKY)
- N cannot be in 4 (from BOUND)
So N must be in 1 or 5

   - N O D _ _ → NOD__ (invalid)
   - N O _ D _ → NOD in 3, but we need a valid word
   - N O _ _ D → D in 5 - invalid

- _ O _ _ N (N in 5)
   - _ O D _ N → D in 3
   - _ O _ D N → D in 4

Let's try real words:
- ""CODON"" - but C, O, D, O, N - but O is in 2, D in 3, N in 5. This is a valid word (a unit of DNA). Letters: C, O, D, N - none excluded. This fits all constraints:
   - O in 2 (correct)
   - N in 5 (allowed, since N cannot be in 3 or 4)
   - D in 3 (allowed, since D cannot be in 5)
   - No excluded letters.

""CODON"" seems to fit perfectly.

Based on the accumulated feedback, the word must have:
- O in position 2
- N in position 5 (since it cannot be in 3 or 4)
- D in position 1, 3, or 4 (but cannot be in 5)
- No excluded letters

The only valid word that fits is ""CODON"":

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should contain several of these letters while being a valid 5-letter word.

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U) - but this uses D and U which are less common
- AROSE (A, R, O, S, E) - uses 5 very common letters

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid English word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is NOT in the word.
- R(x) → R is NOT in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 3).
- S(x) → S is NOT in the word.
- E(x) → E is NOT in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains O, but not in position 3.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O somewhere other than position 3.
- No A, R, S, E.

Good letters to try next: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, P, M, etc.

A strategic word would use common remaining letters while placing O in a different position. Let's try ""POINT"":
- P, O, I, N, T
- O is in position 2 (not 3), and none of A, R, S, E are used.

Summary so far:
- Letters in the word: O (position 2), N (somewhere else).
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, T.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2.
- N somewhere other than position 4.
- No A, R, S, E, P, I, T.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V, W, Y.

Let's try to form a word:
- Position 2 is O.
- N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
- We need valid combinations.

Possible words:
- CONDO: but D is allowed, but we have O twice (position 2 and 5) - but we don't know if O repeats.
- MONEY: but we have N and O, and E is excluded.
- HONKY: K is allowed, but Y is allowed, but H is allowed.
- FOGGY: but G is allowed, but we have O in position 2 and G in 3 and 5.
- BONNY: N is in position 1 and 4 (but 4 is wrong for N), so 4 is invalid.
- DONAL: but A is excluded.
- GONAD: but A and D are allowed? A is excluded.
- HONED: E is excluded.
- LONER: E and R are excluded.
- WONKY: W, O, N, K, Y - all letters allowed (no excluded ones), and N is in position 3 (not 4), O in position 2.

""WONKY"" seems valid:
- W: allowed
- O: position 2 (correct)
- N: position 3 (not 4, so allowed)
- K: allowed

- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, P, I, T, W, K, Y
- Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 2
- N in position 3
- No letters from the excluded list.

Possible patterns: _ O N _ _

Let's list possible letters for positions 1, 4, 5 from the allowed set.

Position 1: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V
Position 4: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V
Position 5: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, U, V

We need to form a valid word. Let's think of common 5-letter words fitting _ O N _ _.

Possible words:
- BOUND: B, O, U, N, D → B, U, D are allowed, but U is allowed and D is allowed. Check positions: O in 2, N in 3. This fits.
- CONED: C, O, N, E, D → E is excluded.
- DONAL: A is excluded.
- FONDS: S is excluded.
- GONAD: A is excluded.
- HONED: E is excluded.
- LONER: E is excluded.
- MOUND: M, O, U, N, D → M, U, D are allowed. This fits.
- ROUND: R is excluded.
- SOUND: S is excluded.

Between BOUND and MOUND, both fit. Let's check which is more likely. Both are valid, but we can choose either. Let's go with BOUND first.

But wait, let me verify:
- BOUND: B, O, U, N, D
- Excluded letters: A, R, S, E, P, I, T, W, K, Y
- B, U, D are not excluded. This is valid.

Another option: MOUND - same logic.

Let's choose BOUND as it's a common word.

- C O M D N → COM DN (invalid)
- L O V D N → LOV DN (invalid)
- H O M D N → HOM DN (invalid)
- V O L D N → VOL DN (invalid)

None seem valid.

Pattern 2: N O _ D _
First letter: N
Second: O
Third: any allowed letter (C, F, G, H, L, M, V)
Fifth: any allowed letter (C, F, G, H, L, M, V)

Possible words:
- N O C D _ → NOCD_ (invalid)
- N O F D _ → NOFD_ (invalid)
- N O G D _ → NOGD_ (invalid)
- N O H D _ → NOHD_ (invalid)
- N O L D _ → NOLD_ (invalid)
- N O M D _ → NOMD_ (invalid)
- N O V D _ → NOVD_ (invalid)

None seem valid.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the word has N in position 5 and D in position 1 or 3 or 4.

Possible pattern: _ O _ _ N
With D in 1, 3, or 4.

- D O _ _ N
- _ O D _ N
- _ O _ D N

Let's check:

1. D O _ _ N
   - D O C L N → DOC LN (invalid)
   - D O M B N → B excluded
   - D O G H N → DOGHN (invalid)
   - D O L F N → DOLFN (invalid)

2. _ O D _ N
   - C O D L N → CODLN (invalid)
   - F O D L N → FODLN (invalid)
   - G O D L N → GODLN (invalid)
   - H O D L N → HODLN (invalid)
   - L O D L N → LODLN (invalid)
   - M O D L N → MODLN (invalid)
   - V O D L N → VODLN (invalid)

3. _ O _ D N
   - C O M D N → COM DN (invalid)
   - L O V D N → LOV DN (invalid)
   - H O M D N → HOM DN (invalid)
   - M O L D N → MOLDN (invalid)
   - F O G D N → FOGDN (invalid)

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of actual words.

Looking for 5-letter words with:
- O in position 2
- N in position 5
- D in position 1, 3, or 4
- No excluded letters

Possible words:
- D O L P N → P excluded
- C O D L N → CODLN (invalid)
- L O D G N → LODGN (invalid)
- M O D L N → MODLN (invalid)

Wait, let me think of real words:
- ""MODEL"" - but E is excluded
- ""MOUND"" - U is excluded
- ""ROUND"" - U and R excluded
- ""FOUND"" - U and F excluded
- ""DONAL"" - A excluded
- ""CONDO"" - C, O, N, D, O - but O repeats and D is in 4, N in 3 (but N cannot be in 3)
- ""CONED"" - E excluded
- ""FOND"" - too short
- ""GONAD"" - A excluded
- ""HONED"" - E excluded
- ""LONER"" - E excluded
- ""MONG"" - too short
- ""VON"" - too short

This is tricky. Let me re-examine the constraints.

We have:
- O in position 2
- N must be in position 1 or 5 (cannot be 3 or 4)
- D must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 5)
- No excluded letters

Possible combinations:
1. N O _ _ _
   - N O D _ _ → NOD__ (invalid)
   - N O _ D _ → NOD is in 3, but N must be in 1 or 5, so N in 1, O in 2, D in 3, but then N is in 1, D in 3, and we need a valid word.
   - N O _ _ D → N is in 1, O in 2, D in 5 - but D cannot be in 5 (from feedback), so invalid.

2. _ O _ _ N
   - _ O D _ N → D in 3, N in 5
   - _ O _ D N → D in 4, N in 5
   - _ O _ _ D → D in 5 - invalid

Let's try:
- _ O D _ N
   - C O D L N → CODLN (invalid)
   - L O D G N → LODGN (invalid)
   - M O D L N → MODLN (invalid)
   - V O D L N → VODLN (invalid)

- _ O _ D N
   - C O M D N → COM DN (invalid)
   - L O V D N → LOV DN (invalid)
   - H O M D N → HOM DN (invalid)

This seems impossible. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the feedback.

From BOUND:
- N(-) means N is in the word but NOT in position 4
- D(-) means D is in the word but NOT in position 5

We already know:
- N cannot be in 3 (from WONKY)
- N cannot be in 4 (from BOUND)
So N must be in 1 or 5

Similarly, D cannot be in 5 (from BOUND)
So D must be in 1, 3, or 4

Possible patterns:
- N O _ _ _ (N in 1)
   - N O D _ _ → NOD__ (invalid)
   - N O _ D _ → NOD in 3, but we need a valid word
   - N O _ _ D → D in 5 - invalid

- _ O _ _ N (N in 5)
   - _ O D _ N → D in 3
   - _ O _ D N → D in 4

Let's try real words:
- ""CODON"" - but C, O, D, O, N - but O is in 2, D in 3, N in 5. This is a valid word (a unit of DNA). Letters: C, O, D, N - none excluded. This fits all constraints:
   - O in 2 (correct)
   - N in 5 (allowed, since N cannot be in 3 or 4)
   - D in 3 (allowed, since D cannot be in 5)
   - No excluded letters.

""CODON"" seems to fit perfectly.Based on the accumulated feedback, the word must have:
- O in position 2
- N in position 5 (since it cannot be in 3 or 4)
- D in position 1, 3, or 4 (but cannot be in 5)
- No excluded letters

The only valid word that fits is ""CODON"":
- C, O, D, O, N
- O is correctly placed in position 2
- N is in position 5 (allowed)
- D is in position 3 (allowed)
- All letters are allowed and no excluded letters are used

Let's parse the latest feedback on CODON:

C(✓) → C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).

D(-) → D is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 3).
O(-) → O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 4).
N(-) → N is in the word but in the wrong position (currently position 5).

So we now know:

- Position 1: C (correct)
- Position 2: O (correct)
- The remaining letters (positions 3, 4, 5) must include D, O, N, but each must be placed in a new position.

Constraints:
- D cannot be in position 3 (it was there in CODON and got ""-"", so it must be in 4 or 5).
- O cannot be in position 2 or 4 (it was in 2 and 4 and got ""-"", so it must be in 1, 3, or 5). But position 1 is C, so 3 or 5.
- N cannot be in position 3 or 5 (it was in 3 and 5 and got ""-"", so it must be in 1, 2, or 4). But positions 1 and 2 are C and O, so N must be in 4.

So N is in position 4.

Now we have:
C O _ N _

The remaining letters to place are D and O. The only remaining positions are 3 and 5.

From above:
- D must be in 4 or 5. But 4 is N, so D must be in 5.
- O must be in 3 or 5. 5 is D, so O must be in 3.

Thus the word is C O O N D.

Check:
- C in 1 ✓
- O in 2 ✓
- O in 3 (was in 4 before, now in 3) ✓
- N in 4 (was in 3 and 5 before) ✓
- D in 5 (was in 3 before) ✓

All constraints satisfied.
