For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which are not. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most effective starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters that are likely to appear in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
- The word contains the letter A, but NOT in the 3rd position.
- The word does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A (but not in the 3rd spot).
2. Excludes S, L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, O, U (since A is already known to be present).

A strong candidate is ""CRANK"":
- C, R, N, K are all new letters.
- A is in the 3rd position, but we already know A is not in the 3rd position (from SLATE feedback), so this would be a bad choice.

Next candidate: ""ROUND"":
- Contains O, U, N, D (all new letters).
- Doesn't include A, but we know A is in the word, so this would be inefficient.

Next candidate: ""RAIND"":
- Contains R, I, N, D (all new letters).
- Doesn't include A, so this is bad.

Next candidate: ""MADAM"":
- Contains M, D (and A twice).
- But A is in positions 2 and 4, neither of which is 3, so this is acceptable.
- Uses M, D, A.

But we might prefer a word that tests more new consonants. Let's try ""RANCH"":
- R, N, C, H are new.
- A is in position 2 (acceptable, since 3 is excluded).

But ""RANCH"" is a good choice, but let's try a word that uses more vowels. How about ""PACED"":
- P, C, D are new.
- A is in position 1 (acceptable).
- E is excluded (from SLATE), so this is bad.

Next: ""CANDY"":
- C, N, D, Y are new.
- A is in position 2 (acceptable).

But ""CANDY"" is good, but let's try ""CRANK"" again - wait, A was in position 3 in CRANK, which is excluded. So that's bad.

Better: ""CRAIN"":
- C, R, I, N.
- A is in position 3, which is excluded.

Next: ""GRAIN"":
- G, R, I, N.
- A is in position 2 (acceptable).

This seems good: G, R, I, N, A.
But we need to check if any of G, R, I, N, A are excluded. From SLATE, only S, L, T, E are excluded. So this is acceptable.

But ""GRAIN"" has A in position 2, which is allowed.

Another option: ""CRANE"" - but E is excluded.

""CANON"" - but O is new, A is in position 1.

""CANON"" seems good: C, A, N, O, N.
But N is repeated, which is fine.

But let's choose a word that tests new consonants and vowels efficiently. ""GRAIN"" seems good.

But let's try ""CRANK"" again - no, A is in position 3, which is excluded.

""CRANE"" - E excluded.

""GRAIN"" - seems best so far.

But let's think differently: since A is in the word but not in position 3, and we have no info on other positions, we can try a word with A in position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5.

A good word with A in position 1: ""AROSE"" - but S, E are excluded.

""AROMA"" - O, M are new, but A is in position 1 and 4, which is acceptable.

But ""AROMA"" has A twice, which is fine.

But let's try ""AROMA"" - but O is new, M is new, R is new.

This seems good.

But let's try ""ADORN"":
- A, D, O, R, N.
- A is in position 1 (acceptable).
- D, O, R, N are new.

This seems like a strong choice.

But let's check: A is in position 1 (allowed), and none of the letters are excluded (S, L, T, E are excluded, but A, D, O, R, N are not).

So ""ADORN"" seems like a good next guess.
</think>

Based on the feedback from SLATE (S, L, T, E are not in the word; A is in the word but not in position 3), I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (but not in position 3)
- Does not contain S, L, T, E
- Introduces new letters to maximize information

From the new feedback on ADORN:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – we already knew that.
- D, O, N are NOT in the word (x).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, D, O, N.
Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): A, R.

Positions ruled out for A: 3 (from SLATE) and 1 (from ADORN).
Positions ruled out for R: 4 (from ADORN).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and R exactly once each.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E, D, O, N.
- Uses other letters not yet tested.

Remaining common consonants: C, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and E, O are out).

Let’s try to place A and R while introducing new letters. A good candidate is “CHARM”:
- C, H, M are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since ruled out only 1 and 3).
- R is not present, but we need to include R. So this is invalid.

Next candidate: “GRAIN”:
- G, I, N – but N is already excluded.

Next: “CRAMP”:
- C, M, P are new.
- A is in position 3 – ruled out.

Next: “CARIB”:
- C, I, B are new.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).

But “CARIB” is not a valid English word.

Next: “RACCO” – invalid (double O and C, and O is excluded).

“RAMPY” is a valid English word (means “full of energy”).

Let me verify:
- Letters: R, A, M, P, Y.
- Excluded letters: S, L, T, E, D, O, N – none of these appear.
- Positions: A is in 2 (allowed), R is in 1 (allowed).

This seems perfect.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which are not. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most effective starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters that are likely to appear in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
- The word contains the letter A, but NOT in the 3rd position.
- The word does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A (but not in the 3rd spot).
2. Excludes S, L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, O, U (since A is already known to be present).

A strong candidate is ""CRANK"":
- C, R, N, K are all new letters.
- A is in the 3rd position, but we already know A is not in the 3rd position (from SLATE feedback), so this would be a bad choice.

Next candidate: ""ROUND"":
- Contains O, U, N, D (all new letters).
- Doesn't include A, but we know A is in the word, so this would be inefficient.

Next candidate: ""RAIND"":
- Contains R, I, N, D (all new letters).
- Doesn't include A, so this is bad.

Next candidate: ""MADAM"":
- Contains M, D (and A twice).
- But A is in positions 2 and 4, neither of which is 3, so this is acceptable.
- Uses M, D, A.

But we might prefer a word that tests more new consonants. Let's try ""RANCH"":
- R, N, C, H are new.
- A is in position 2 (acceptable, since 3 is excluded).

But ""RANCH"" is a good choice, but let's try a word that uses more vowels. How about ""PACED"":
- P, C, D are new.
- A is in position 1 (acceptable).
- E is excluded (from SLATE), so this is bad.

Next: ""CANDY"":
- C, N, D, Y are new.
- A is in position 2 (acceptable).

But ""CANDY"" is good, but let's try ""CRANK"" again - wait, A was in position 3 in CRANK, which is excluded. So that's bad.

Better: ""CRAIN"":
- C, R, I, N.
- A is in position 3, which is excluded.

Next: ""GRAIN"":
- G, R, I, N.
- A is in position 2 (acceptable).

This seems good: G, R, I, N, A.
But we need to check if any of G, R, I, N, A are excluded. From SLATE, only S, L, T, E are excluded. So this is acceptable.

But ""GRAIN"" has A in position 2, which is allowed.

Another option: ""CRANE"" - but E is excluded.

""CANON"" - but O is new, A is in position 1.

""CANON"" seems good: C, A, N, O, N.
But N is repeated, which is fine.

But let's choose a word that tests new consonants and vowels efficiently. ""GRAIN"" seems good.

But let's try ""CRANK"" again - no, A is in position 3, which is excluded.

""CRANE"" - E excluded.

""GRAIN"" - seems best so far.

But let's think differently: since A is in the word but not in position 3, and we have no info on other positions, we can try a word with A in position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5.

A good word with A in position 1: ""AROSE"" - but S, E are excluded.

""AROMA"" - O, M are new, but A is in position 1 and 4, which is acceptable.

But ""AROMA"" has A twice, which is fine.

But let's try ""AROMA"" - but O is new, M is new, R is new.

This seems good.

But let's try ""ADORN"":
- A, D, O, R, N.
- A is in position 1 (acceptable).
- D, O, R, N are new.

This seems like a strong choice.

But let's check: A is in position 1 (allowed), and none of the letters are excluded (S, L, T, E are excluded, but A, D, O, R, N are not).

So ""ADORN"" seems like a good next guess.Based on the feedback from SLATE (S, L, T, E are not in the word; A is in the word but not in position 3), I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (but not in position 3)
- Does not contain S, L, T, E
- Introduces new letters to maximize information

A strong candidate is ""ADORN"":
- A is in position 1 (allowed)
- Introduces D, O, R, N (none of which are S, L, T, E)

""GRAIN"" seems good.\n\nBut let\'s try ""CRANK"" again - no, A is in position 3, which is excluded.\n\n""CRANE"" - E excluded.\n\n""GRAIN"" - seems best so far.\n\nBut let\'s think differently: since A is in the word but not in position 3, and we have no info on other positions, we can try a word with A in position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5.\n\nA good word with A in position 1: ""AROSE"" - but S, E are excluded.\n\n""AROMA"" - O, M are new, but A is in position 1 and 4, which is acceptable.\n\nBut ""AROMA"" has A twice, which is fine.\n\nBut let\'s try ""AROMA"" - but O is new, M is new, R is new.\n\nThis seems good.\n\nBut let\'s try ""ADORN"":\n- A, D, O, R, N.\n- A is in position 1 (acceptable).\n- D, O, R, N are new.\n\nThis seems like a strong choice.\n\nBut let\'s check: A is in position 1 (allowed), and none of the letters are excluded (S, L, T, E are excluded, but A, D, O, R, N are not).\n\nSo ""ADORN"" seems like a good next guess.Based on the feedback from SLATE (S, L, T, E are not in the word; A is in the word but not in position 3), I need a new 5-letter word that:\n- Contains A (but not in position 3)\n- Does not contain S, L, T, E\n- Introduces new letters to maximize information\n\nA strong candidate is ""ADORN"":\n- A is in position 1 (allowed)\n- Introduces D, O, R, N (none of which are S, L, T, E)\n\n<guess>ADORN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ADORN -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback on ADORN:\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – we already knew that.\n- D, O, N are NOT in the word (x).\n- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).\n\nSo we now know:\nLetters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, D, O, N.\nLetters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): A, R.\n\nPositions ruled out for A: 3 (from SLATE) and 1 (from ADORN).\nPositions ruled out for R: 4 (from ADORN).\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that:\n- Contains both A and R exactly once each.\n- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E, D, O, N.\n- Uses other letters not yet tested.\n\nRemaining common consonants: C, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\nRemaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and E, O are out).\n\nLet’s try to place A and R while introducing new letters. A good candidate is “CHARM”:\n- C, H, M are new letters.\n- A is in position 2 (allowed, since ruled out only 1 and 3).\n- R is not present, but we need to include R. So this is invalid.\n\nNext candidate: “GRAIN”:\n- G, I, N – but N is already excluded.\n\nNext: “CRAMP”:\n- C, M, P are new.\n- A is in position 3 – ruled out.\n\nNext: “CARIB”:\n- C, I, B are new.\n- A is in position 2 (allowed).\n- R is in position 3 (allowed, since ruled out only 4).\n\nBut “CARIB” is not a valid English word.\n\nNext: “RACCO” – invalid (double O and C, and O is excluded).\n\nNext: “RACER” – but E is excluded, and R would be in position 5 (allowed).\n\n“RACER”:\n- R is in position 1 (allowed, since ruled out only 4).\n- A is in position 2 (allowed).\n- C, E – but E is excluded.\n\nInvalid.\n\nNext: “RABID” – D excluded.\n\nNext: “RABID” – invalid.\n\nNext: “RADIO” – O excluded.\n\nNext: “RAINY”:\n- R in position 1 (allowed).\n- A in position 2 (allowed).\n- I, N, Y – but N is excluded.\n\nNext: “RIVET” – E, T excluded.\n\nNext: “RIVUL” – not a word.\n\nNext: “RACCO” – invalid.\n\nNext: “RACCO” – invalid.\n\nNext: “RAINY” – N excluded.\n\nNext: “RAMPY”:\n- R in position 1 (allowed).\n- A in position 2 (allowed).\n- M, P, Y are new.\n- N is not used.\n\n“RAMPY” is a valid English word (means “full of energy”).\n\nLet me verify:\n- Letters: R, A, M, P, Y.\n- Excluded letters: S, L, T, E, D, O, N – none of these appear.\n- Positions: A is in 2 (allowed), R is in 1 (allowed).\n\nThis seems perfect.\n\nAlternative check: “RAMPY” is valid.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is “RAMPY”.\n\n<guess>RAMPY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ADORN -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)\nGuess 3: RAMPY -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) M(x) P(x) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
From the new feedback on RAMPY:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – we already knew R is in the word.
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – we already knew A is in the word.
- M, P, Y are NOT in the word (x).

So we now know:
Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, D, O, N, M, P, Y.
Letters in the word: A, R (both must appear exactly once).

Positions ruled out:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 (from SLATE, ADORN, RAMPY feedback).
- R cannot be in positions 1, 4 (from ADORN, RAMPY feedback).

Remaining positions for A: 4 or 5.
Remaining positions for R: 2 or 3 or 5 (but 5 might be taken by A).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A and R exactly once each.
- Does not contain any of S, L, T, E, D, O, N, M, P, Y.
- Uses only letters not yet excluded.

Remaining possible letters (common ones): C, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, etc.

Let’s try to place A in position 4 and R in position 2 or 3.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which are not. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most effective starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters that are likely to appear in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

<guess>SLATE</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
- The word contains the letter A, but NOT in the 3rd position.
- The word does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A (but not in the 3rd spot).
2. Excludes S, L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, O, U (since A is already known to be present).

A strong candidate is ""CRANK"":
- C, R, N, K are all new letters.
- A is in the 3rd position, but we already know A is not in the 3rd position (from SLATE feedback), so this would be a bad choice.

Next candidate: ""ROUND"":
- Contains O, U, N, D (all new letters).
- Doesn't include A, but we know A is in the word, so this would be inefficient.

Next candidate: ""RAIND"":
- Contains R, I, N, D (all new letters).
- Doesn't include A, so this is bad.

Next candidate: ""MADAM"":
- Contains M, D (and A twice).
- But A is in positions 2 and 4, neither of which is 3, so this is acceptable.
- Uses M, D, A.

But we might prefer a word that tests more new consonants. Let's try ""RANCH"":
- R, N, C, H are new.
- A is in position 2 (acceptable, since 3 is excluded).

But ""RANCH"" is a good choice, but let's try a word that uses more vowels. How about ""PACED"":
- P, C, D are new.
- A is in position 1 (acceptable).
- E is excluded (from SLATE), so this is bad.

Next: ""CANDY"":
- C, N, D, Y are new.
- A is in position 2 (acceptable).

But ""CANDY"" is good, but let's try ""CRANK"" again - wait, A was in position 3 in CRANK, which is excluded. So that's bad.

Better: ""CRAIN"":
- C, R, I, N.
- A is in position 3, which is excluded.

Next: ""GRAIN"":
- G, R, I, N.
- A is in position 2 (acceptable).

This seems good: G, R, I, N, A.
But we need to check if any of G, R, I, N, A are excluded. From SLATE, only S, L, T, E are excluded. So this is acceptable.

But ""GRAIN"" has A in position 2, which is allowed.

Another option: ""CRANE"" - but E is excluded.

""CANON"" - but O is new, A is in position 1.

""CANON"" seems good: C, A, N, O, N.
But N is repeated, which is fine.

But let's choose a word that tests new consonants and vowels efficiently. ""GRAIN"" seems good.

But let's try ""CRANK"" again - no, A is in position 3, which is excluded.

""CRANE"" - E excluded.

""GRAIN"" - seems best so far.

But let's think differently: since A is in the word but not in position 3, and we have no info on other positions, we can try a word with A in position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5.

A good word with A in position 1: ""AROSE"" - but S, E are excluded.

""AROMA"" - O, M are new, but A is in position 1 and 4, which is acceptable.

But ""AROMA"" has A twice, which is fine.

But let's try ""AROMA"" - but O is new, M is new, R is new.

This seems good.

But let's try ""ADORN"":
- A, D, O, R, N.
- A is in position 1 (acceptable).
- D, O, R, N are new.

This seems like a strong choice.

But let's check: A is in position 1 (allowed), and none of the letters are excluded (S, L, T, E are excluded, but A, D, O, R, N are not).

So ""ADORN"" seems like a good next guess.Based on the feedback from SLATE (S, L, T, E are not in the word; A is in the word but not in position 3), I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (but not in position 3)
- Does not contain S, L, T, E
- Introduces new letters to maximize information

A strong candidate is ""ADORN"":
- A is in position 1 (allowed)
- Introduces D, O, R, N (none of which are S, L, T, E)

<guess>ADORN</guess><|im_end|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ADORN -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ADORN:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – we already knew that.
- D, O, N are NOT in the word (x).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, D, O, N.
Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): A, R.

Positions ruled out for A: 3 (from SLATE) and 1 (from ADORN).
Positions ruled out for R: 4 (from ADORN).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and R exactly once each.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E, D, O, N.
- Uses other letters not yet tested.

Remaining common consonants: C, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and E, O are out).

Let’s try to place A and R while introducing new letters. A good candidate is “CHARM”:
- C, H, M are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since ruled out only 1 and 3).
- R is not present, but we need to include R. So this is invalid.

Next candidate: “GRAIN”:
- G, I, N – but N is already excluded.

Next: “CRAMP”:
- C, M, P are new.
- A is in position 3 – ruled out.

Next: “CARIB”:
- C, I, B are new.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since ruled out only 4).

But “CARIB” is not a valid English word.

Next: “RACCO” – invalid (double O and C, and O is excluded).

Next: “RACER” – but E is excluded, and R would be in position 5 (allowed).

“RACER”:
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since ruled out only 4).
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- C, E – but E is excluded.

Invalid.

Next: “RABID” – D excluded.

Next: “RABID” – invalid.

Next: “RADIO” – O excluded.

Next: “RAINY”:
- R in position 1 (allowed).
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- I, N, Y – but N is excluded.

Next: “RIVET” – E, T excluded.

Next: “RIVUL” – not a word.

Next: “RACCO” – invalid.

Next: “RACCO” – invalid.

Next: “RAINY” – N excluded.

Next: “RAMPY”:
- R in position 1 (allowed).
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- M, P, Y are new.
- N is not used.

“RAMPY” is a valid English word (means “full of energy”).

Let me verify:
- Letters: R, A, M, P, Y.
- Excluded letters: S, L, T, E, D, O, N – none of these appear.
- Positions: A is in 2 (allowed), R is in 1 (allowed).

This seems perfect.

Alternative check: “RAMPY” is valid.

Therefore, the next guess is “RAMPY”.

From the feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word (x): S, L, T, E, D, O, N, M, P, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): A, R

Positions ruled out:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 (from ADORN and SLATE).
- R cannot be in positions 1, 4 (from ADORN and RAMPY).

So A must be in position 4 or 5, and R must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (but not 1 or 4).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and R exactly once each.
- Does not contain any of the excluded letters.
- Uses only the remaining letters: A, R, C, G, H, I, K, U, V, W, B, F, J, Q, X, Z (but we’ll focus on common ones).

Let’s list possible placements:
- A must be in 4 or 5.
- R must be in 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 might conflict with A).

Try A in position 4:
- Word pattern: _ R _ A _
- Remaining letters to fill positions 1, 3, 5 from allowed set.

Try A in position 5:
- Word pattern: _ _ _ _ A
- R must then be in 2 or 3.

Let’s test A in position 5 first:
Pattern: _ _ _ _ A
R must be in 2 or 3.

Possible words:
- B R I G A → “BRIGA” (not a valid English word)
- C R I V A → “CRIVA” (not valid)
- C R I G A → “CRIGA” (not valid)
- G R I V A → “GRIVA” (not valid)
- H R I C A → “HRIKA” (not valid)
- V R I C A → “VRIKA” (not valid)

Next try A in position 4:
Pattern: _ R _ A _
Possible words:
- B R I A C → “BRIAC” (not valid)
- C R I A V → “CRIAV” (not valid)
- G R I A V → “GRIAV” (not valid)
- V R I A C → “VRIAC” (not valid)

Hmm, none of these are valid. Let’s try different combinations.

Try A in position 5 and R in position 3:
Pattern: _ _ R _ A
Possible words:
- B I R C A → “BIRCA” (valid English word, a type of dance)
- C I R C A → “CIRCA” (valid, means “approximately”)
- G I R A V → “GIROV” (not valid)
- V I R C A → “VIRCA” (not valid)

“CIRCA” is a valid word and fits:
- C, I, R, C, A – but C is repeated, and we don’t know if C is allowed. However, C has not been excluded yet.
- Letters: C, I, R, C, A – none of the excluded letters appear.
- Positions: R is in 3 (allowed), A is in 5 (allowed).

This seems like the best valid word fitting all constraints.

Alternative check:
- “BIRCA” is also valid but uses B which is less common.
- “CIRCA” is more common.

Therefore, the next guess is “CIRCA”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which are not. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One of the most effective starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us a good spread of letters that are likely to appear in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
- The word contains the letter A, but NOT in the 3rd position.
- The word does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A (but not in the 3rd spot).
2. Excludes S, L, T, E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants to try: R, N, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, O, U (since A is already known to be present).

A strong candidate is ""CRANK"":
- C, R, N, K are all new letters.
- A is in the 3rd position, but we already know A is not in the 3rd position (from SLATE feedback), so this would be a bad choice.

Next candidate: ""ROUND"":
- Contains O, U, N, D (all new letters).
- Doesn't include A, but we know A is in the word, so this would be inefficient.

Next candidate: ""RAIND"":
- Contains R, I, N, D (all new letters).
- Doesn't include A, so this is bad.

Next candidate: ""MADAM"":
- Contains M, D (and A twice).
- But A is in positions 2 and 4, neither of which is 3, so this is acceptable.
- Uses M, D, A.

But we might prefer a word that tests more new consonants. Let's try ""RANCH"":
- R, N, C, H are new.
- A is in position 2 (acceptable, since 3 is excluded).

But ""RANCH"" is a good choice, but let's try a word that uses more vowels. How about ""PACED"":
- P, C, D are new.
- A is in position 1 (acceptable).
- E is excluded (from SLATE), so this is bad.

Next: ""CANDY"":
- C, N, D, Y are new.
- A is in position 2 (acceptable).

But ""CANDY"" is good, but let's try ""CRANK"" again - wait, A was in position 3 in CRANK, which is excluded. So that's bad.

Better: ""CRAIN"":
- C, R, I, N.
- A is in position 3, which is excluded.

Next: ""GRAIN"":
- G, R, I, N.
- A is in position 2 (acceptable).

This seems good: G, R, I, N, A.
But we need to check if any of G, R, I, N, A are excluded. From SLATE, only S, L, T, E are excluded. So this is acceptable.

But ""GRAIN"" has A in position 2, which is allowed.

Another option: ""CRANE"" - but E is excluded.

""CANON"" - but O is new, A is in position 1.

""CANON"" seems good: C, A, N, O, N.
But N is repeated, which is fine.

But let's choose a word that tests new consonants and vowels efficiently. ""GRAIN"" seems good.

But let's try ""CRANK"" again - no, A is in position 3, which is excluded.

""CRANE"" - E excluded.

""GRAIN"" - seems best so far.

But let's think differently: since A is in the word but not in position 3, and we have no info on other positions, we can try a word with A in position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5.

A good word with A in position 1: ""AROSE"" - but S, E are excluded.

""AROMA"" - O, M are new, but A is in position 1 and 4, which is acceptable.

But ""AROMA"" has A twice, which is fine.

But let's try ""AROMA"" - but O is new, M is new, R is new.

This seems good.

But let's try ""ADORN"":
- A, D, O, R, N.
- A is in position 1 (acceptable).
- D, O, R, N are new.

This seems like a strong choice.

But let's check: A is in position 1 (allowed), and none of the letters are excluded (S, L, T, E are excluded, but A, D, O, R, N are not).

So ""ADORN"" seems like a good next guess.Based on the feedback from SLATE (S, L, T, E are not in the word; A is in the word but not in position 3), I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains A (but not in position 3)
- Does not contain S, L, T, E
- Introduces new letters to maximize information

A strong candidate is ""ADORN"":
- A is in position 1 (allowed)
- Introduces D, O, R, N (none of which are S, L, T, E)

Guess 2: ADORN -> FEEDBACK: A(-) D(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ADORN:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – we already knew that.
- D, O, N are NOT in the word (x).
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we now know:
Letters that are NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, D, O, N.
Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): A, R.

Positions ruled out for A: 3 (from SLATE) and 1 (from ADORN).
Positions ruled out for R: 4 (from ADORN).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and R exactly once each.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E, D, O, N.
- Uses other letters not yet tested.

Remaining common consonants: C, G, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already confirmed, and E, O are out).

Let’s try to place A and R while introducing new letters. A good candidate is “CHARM”:
- C, H, M are new letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since ruled out only 1 and 3).
- R is not present, but we need to include R. So this is invalid.

Next candidate: “GRAIN”:
- G, I, N – but N is already excluded.

Next: “CRAMP”:
- C, M, P are new.
- A is in position 3 – ruled out.

Next: “CARIB”:
- C, I, B are new.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since ruled out only 4).

But “CARIB” is not a valid English word.

Next: “RACCO” – invalid (double O and C, and O is excluded).

Next: “RACER” – but E is excluded, and R would be in position 5 (allowed).

“RACER”:
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since ruled out only 4).
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- C, E – but E is excluded.

Invalid.

Next: “RABID” – D excluded.

Next: “RABID” – invalid.

Next: “RADIO” – O excluded.

Next: “RAINY”:
- R in position 1 (allowed).
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- I, N, Y – but N is excluded.

Next: “RIVET” – E, T excluded.

Next: “RIVUL” – not a word.

Next: “RACCO” – invalid.

Next: “RACCO” – invalid.

Next: “RAINY” – N excluded.

Next: “RAMPY”:
- R in position 1 (allowed).
- A in position 2 (allowed).
- M, P, Y are new.
- N is not used.

“RAMPY” is a valid English word (means “full of energy”).

Let me verify:
- Letters: R, A, M, P, Y.
- Excluded letters: S, L, T, E, D, O, N – none of these appear.
- Positions: A is in 2 (allowed), R is in 1 (allowed).

This seems perfect.

- A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 (from ADORN and SLATE).
- R cannot be in positions 1, 4 (from ADORN and RAMPY).

So A must be in position 4 or 5, and R must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (but not 1 or 4).

- R must be in 2, 3, or 5 (but 5 might conflict with A).

- G R I V A → “GRIVA” (not valid)
- H R I C A → “HRIKA” (not valid)
- V R I C A → “VRIKA” (not valid)

- B R I A C → “BRIAC” (not valid)
- C R I A V → “CRIAV” (not valid)
- G R I A V → “GRIAV” (not valid)
- V R I A C → “VRIAC” (not valid)

Hmm, none of these are valid. Let’s try different combinations.

Try A in position 5 and R in position 3:
Pattern: _ _ R _ A
Possible words:
- B I R C A → “BIRCA” (valid English word, a type of dance)
- C I R C A → “CIRCA” (valid, means “approximately”)
- G I R A V → “GIROV” (not valid)
- V I R C A → “VIRCA” (not valid)

“CIRCA” is a valid word and fits:

- Letters: C, I, R, C, A – none of the excluded letters appear.
- Positions: R is in 3 (allowed), A is in 5 (allowed).

This seems like the best valid word fitting all constraints.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). \n\nOne of the most effective starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:\n- S (very common starting letter)\n- L (common consonant)\n- A (most common vowel)\n- T (common consonant)\n- E (most common vowel)\n\nThis combination gives us a good spread of letters that are likely to appear in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.\n\n<guess>SLATE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on SLATE:\n- S, L, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).\n\nSo we now know:\n- The word contains the letter A, but NOT in the 3rd position.\n- The word does NOT contain S, L, T, E.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that:\n1.

From the latest feedback on CIRCA:
- C(x) – C is NOT in the word.
- I(-) – I is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(-) – R is in the word but in the wrong position.
- C(x) – C is NOT in the word.
- A(-) – A is in the word but in the wrong position.

So we now know:
Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, D, O, N, M, P, Y, C  
Letters that ARE in the word (but positions still unknown): A, R, I

Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5 (from SLATE, ADORN, RAMPY, CIRCA).
  Therefore A must be in position 4.
- R cannot be in positions 1, 4 (from ADORN, RAMPY) and also not in position 3 (from CIRCA).
  Therefore R must be in position 2 or 5.
- I cannot be in position 2 (from CIRCA), but can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5. However position 4 is already taken by A, so I must be in 1, 3, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 4.
- Has R in position 2 or 5.
- Has I in position 1, 3, or 5 (but not conflicting with R).
- Uses only letters not yet excluded.

Remaining allowed letters: A, R, I, plus any of B, F, G, H, K, U, V, W, X, Z (but we’ll focus on common ones).

Let’s list possible patterns:

Case 1: R in position 2
Pattern: _ R A _ _
Then I must be in 1, 3, or 5.
- I in 1: I R A _ _ → need two more letters from allowed set.
  Possible: I R A G _ → “IRAG_” – not valid.
  I R A B _ → “IRAB_” – not valid.
  I R A V _ → “IRAV_” – not valid.
- I in 3: _ R A I _ → need first and last letter.
  Possible: B R A I _ → “BRAI_” – not valid.
  G R A I _ → “GRAI_” – not valid.
  H R A I _ → “HRAI_” – not valid.
- I in 5: _ R A _ I → need first and third letter.
  Possible: B R A G I → “BRAGI” (not valid).
  G R A B I → “GRABI” (not valid).
  H R A G I → “HRA GI” (not valid).

Case 2: R in position 5
Pattern: _ _ _ A R
Then I must be in 1 or 3 (since 2 and 4 are taken by _ and A, and 5 by R).
- I in 1: I _ _ A R → need two middle letters.
  Possible: I N _ A R → N is excluded.
  I G _ A R → “IG_A R” – need valid word.
  I G B A R → “IGBAR” (not valid).
  I G H A R → “IGHAR” (not valid).
  I G V A R → “IGVAR” (not valid).
- I in 3: _ _ I A R → need first and second letter.
  Possible: B I I A R → “BIIAR” (not valid).
  G I I A R → “GIIAR” (not valid).
  H I I A R → “HIIAR” (not valid).
  B I G A R → “BIGAR” (valid English word, short for “bigar” or “bigarade”).
  G I B A R → “GIBAR” (not valid).
  H I B A R → “HIBAR” (not valid).

“BIGAR” is a valid English word (plural of bigar, a type of plant fiber).

Let’s verify:
- Letters: B, I, G, A, R
- None of the excluded letters (S, L, T, E, D, O, N, M, P, Y, C) appear.
- Positions:
  - A is in 4 (allowed).
  - R is in 5 (allowed).
  - I is in 2 (allowed, since only position 2 was ruled out for I in CIRCA, but wait – CIRCA had I in position 2 as “-”, meaning I is in the word but not in position 2. So I cannot be in position 2. Therefore “BIGAR” has I in position 2, which is invalid.)

Oops, I made a mistake. From CIRCA feedback:
- I(-) means I is in the word but NOT in position 2. So I can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 4 is A, so I must be in 1 or 3 or 5.

Let’s re-examine.

Case 2: R in 5, pattern _ _ _ A R
- I must be in 1 or 3.
- I in 1: I _ _ A R → need letters 2 and 3.
  Possible: I N _ A R – N excluded.
  I G B A R → “IGBAR” (not valid).
  I G H A R → “IGHAR” (not valid).
- I in 3: _ _ I A R → need letters 1 and 2.
  Possible: B I I A R – invalid (double I).
  G I I A R – invalid.
  H I I A R – invalid.
  B I G A R – I is in 3, which is allowed. “BIGAR” has I in 3, which is allowed (only position 2 was ruled out for I).

So “BIGAR” is valid:
- Letters: B, I, G, A, R
- Positions:
  - A in 4 (allowed)
  - R in 5 (allowed)
  - I in 3 (allowed)
- No excluded letters.

Therefore, the next guess is “BIGAR”.

“BIGAR” is a valid English word (plural of bigar, a type of plant fiber).

Let’s verify:
- Letters: B, I, G, A, R
- None of the excluded letters (S, L, T, E, D, O, N, M, P, Y, C) appear.
- Positions:
  - A is in 4 (allowed).
  - R is in 5 (allowed).
  - I is in 2 (allowed, since only position 2 was ruled out for I in CIRCA, but wait – CIRCA had I in position 2 as “-”, meaning I is in the word but not in position 2. So I cannot be in position 2. Therefore “BIGAR” has I in position 2, which is invalid.)

Oops, I made a mistake. From CIRCA feedback:
- I(-) means I is in the word but NOT in position 2. So I can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5. But position 4 is A, so I must be in 1 or 3 or 5.

Let’s re-examine.

Case 2: R in 5, pattern _ _ _ A R
