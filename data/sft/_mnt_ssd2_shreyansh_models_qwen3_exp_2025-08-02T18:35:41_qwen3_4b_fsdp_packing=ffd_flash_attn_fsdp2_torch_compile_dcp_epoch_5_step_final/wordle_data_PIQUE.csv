### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives me a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word early on, providing valuable feedback for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (all marked x).
- E is in the word and is in the correct position (last letter).

So the secret word ends in E and contains none of A, R, O, S.  
I need a 5-letter word ending in E that avoids those four letters.  
Good remaining consonants to test: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A, O are ruled out).

A strong second guess should test new common letters while keeping the last letter as E.  
“UNTIE” is a good candidate because:
- It ends in E.
- It uses U, N, T, I – none of which have been tested yet.
- It avoids A, R, O, S entirely.

Current constraints:
1. Word ends in E (from arose feedback).
2. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, N, T.
3. Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions: U (somewhere other than 1st) and I (somewhere other than 4th).

So the word is _ _ _ _ E, contains U and I, and does NOT contain A, R, O, S, N, T.

Remaining possible consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining possible vowels: only I and E are confirmed; U is confirmed but position unknown.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing both U and I, avoiding the banned letters.  
Possible patterns:
- I _ _ U E
- U _ I _ E
- _ I U _ E
- _ U _ I E
- etc.

A good candidate is ""DUBIE"" – but that’s not a valid English word.  
Another is ""CUBIE"" – also not valid.  
""BUILD"" ends in D, not E.  
""LIQUE"" – not valid.  
""QUIET"" – ends in T, which is banned.  
""VIGUE"" – not valid.  
""CHIDE"" – contains D, H, C, I, E – but D and H are allowed, C is allowed, I is allowed, E is correct.  
""CHIDE"" fits all constraints: ends in E, contains I, has U somewhere? No, it doesn’t have U.  
We need a word with both U and I.

""PUKEE"" – not valid.  
""BUKEY"" – ends in Y.  
""FUKEE"" – not valid.  
""KUIPE"" – not valid.  
""VIGUE"" – not valid.  
""PIQUE"" – ends in E, has I and U? No, P-I-Q-U-E – that has I and U and ends in E.  
""PIQUE"" is a valid English word (a type of fabric or a musical term).  
Let’s check:
- Ends in E: yes.
- Contains U and I: yes, positions 4 and 2 respectively.
- Doesn’t contain any banned letters: A, R, O, S, N, T are absent.
- All letters are allowed.
