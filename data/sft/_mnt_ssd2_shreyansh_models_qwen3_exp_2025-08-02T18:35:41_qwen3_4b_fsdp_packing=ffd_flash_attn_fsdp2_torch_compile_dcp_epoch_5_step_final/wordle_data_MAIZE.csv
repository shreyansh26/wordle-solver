2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (very common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to start narrowing down possibilities.

So far we know:

2. It contains A somewhere, but not in position 3.
3. It does NOT contain S, L, T.

Next, I want to test new consonants and vowels while keeping E fixed. A good second-guess pattern is to place A in a different spot and introduce new common consonants. The word ""CRANE"" fits this:
- C and R are new consonants.
- A is moved to position 2 (was in 3, so this is valid).
- N is another new consonant.
- E stays in position 5.

This should help narrow down the remaining letters.

- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- D is not in the word.
- E is confirmed in position 5.

So the pattern so far is:
- Position 3: I
- Position 5: E
- Position 4: A (since A cannot be in 1,2,3,5 and must be used)
- Position 2 or 3: M (but 3 is already I, so M must be in position 2)

Therefore the word must be: _ M I A E

The only common 5-letter word that fits is ""MIAEA"" but that's not valid. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, the pattern is:
- Position 4: A
- Position 3: I
- Position 5: E
- Position 2: M (since M can't be in 3)
- Position 1: ?

But position 1 is still unknown. We need a consonant that hasn't been ruled out (S,L,T,C,R,N,D). Let's try G.

Word: G M I A E → ""GMIAE"" not valid. 

Wait, the pattern is _ M I A E. Common words ending in ""IAE"" are rare. Let me think differently.

Actually, the pattern is:
- Position 4: A
- Position 3: I
- Position 5: E
- Position 2: M (since M must be in 2 or 3, but 3 is I)
- Position 1: ?

So the word is _ M I A E. The only valid word fitting this is ""MIAEA"" which isn't valid. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback:
- AMIDE: A(-) M(-) I(✓) D(x) E(✓)

- A is in the word but not in position 1
- M is in the word but not in position 2
- I is in position 3
- E is in position 5
- D is not in the word

So positions:
1: ?
2: ?
3: I
4: ?
5: E

From AMIDE we also learned that A is not in position 1, so A must be in position 4 (since it can't be in 2 or 3, and 5 is E).

So pattern: _ _ I A E

From CRANE and SLATE we know:
- M is in the word but not in position 2
- So M must be in position 1 or 4, but 4 is A, so M must be in position 1.

Thus pattern: M _ I A E

The only common 5-letter word fitting this is ""MIAEA"" which isn't valid. This suggests I might have made an error.

Wait, let's list possible words ending in ""IAE"":
- ""MIAEA"" - invalid
- ""PIATE"" - not a word
- ""FIARE"" - not a word

Hmm, this seems problematic. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From AMIDE:
- A(-) - A is in the word but not in position 1
- M(-) - M is in the word but not in position 2
- I(✓) - I is in position 3
- D(x) - D is not in the word
- E(✓) - E is in position 5

Thus:
- Position 3: I
- Position 5: E
- A must be in position 4 (since it can't be in 1,2,3,5)
- M must be in position 1 (since it can't be in 2 and 3,4,5 are taken)
- Position 2: ?

So the word is M _ I A E

Possible consonants left: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common words: M B I A E - ""MBIAE"" invalid
M P I A E - ""MPIAE"" invalid
M H I A E - ""MHIAE"" invalid

This suggests I might have misinterpreted the feedback. Let me re-examine:

From AMIDE:
- A(-) - A is in the word but not in position 1
- M(-) - M is in the word but not in position 2
- I(✓) - I is in position 3
- D(x) - D is not in the word
- E(✓) - E is in position 5

Thus:
- Positions 3 and 5 are fixed: I and E
- A must be in position 2 or 4 (since 1 and 5 are excluded, and 3 is I)
- M must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (but 3 is I, so 1 or 4)
- From CRANE feedback: M is in the word but not in position 2
- From SLATE feedback: M is not in the word (but wait, SLATE didn't have M)

Wait, no, SLATE had S,L,A,T,E. CRANE had C,R,A,N,E. AMIDE has A,M,I,D,E.

So M is only confirmed in AMIDE to be in the word but not in position 2.

Thus possible positions for M: 1,3,4
But position 3 is I, so M must be in 1 or 4.

If M is in 1: word is M _ I A E (but A must be in 2 or 4)
If M is in 4: word is _ _ I M E, but then where is A?

This is getting complicated. Let me try to list possible words:

From feedback:
- Ends with I A E or _ I A E
- Contains M not in position 2
- Doesn't contain S,L,T,C,R,N,D

Possible words:
- ""MIAEA"" - invalid
- ""PIATE"" - not a word
- ""FIARE"" - not a word
- ""GIMAE"" - not a word
- ""HIMAE"" - not a word

This suggests I might have made an error in interpreting the feedback. Let me re-examine:

From AMIDE:
- A(-) - A is in the word but not in position 1
- M(-) - M is in the word but not in position 2
- I(✓) - I is in position 3
- D(x) - D is not in the word
- E(✓) - E is in position 5

Thus:
- Position 3: I
- Position 5: E
- A must be in position 2 or 4
- M must be in position 1 or 4
- Position 1 and 2 or 4 must be filled with remaining letters not ruled out

Possible combinations:
1. M in 1, A in 2: M A I _ E - but position 4 is free, but we have to use M and A
   Word: M A I _ E - but we already used M and A, and need to fit remaining letters
   However, this would be M A I _ E, but we have to check if this fits all constraints
   But this seems to fit:
   - M in 1 (allowed)
   - A in 2 (allowed)
   - I in 3
   - E in 5
   - Position 4 is free, but we have to use letters not ruled out
   But we have to use M and A, and these are already placed.

This seems like ""MAIE_"" but we need a 5-letter word. The only common word fitting this is ""MAIZE"" but Z hasn't been tested yet.

Let me check:
- MAIZE:
   - M in 1 (allowed)
   - A in 2 (allowed)
   - I in 3 (matches)
   - Z in 4 (new letter)
   - E in 5 (matches)
   - Letters used: M,A,I,Z,E
   - Letters ruled out so far: S,L,T,C,R,N,D
   - Z hasn't been ruled out, so this is possible.

This seems like a valid next guess.
</think>

From the feedback:
- I is locked in position 3.
- E is locked in position 5.
- A must be in position 2 or 4 (not 1,3,5).
- M must be in position 1 or 4 (not 2,3,5).
- We need a 5-letter word that fits these constraints.

The word ""MAIZE"" fits:
- M in position 1
- A in position 2
- I in position 3
- Z in position 4
- E in position 5

This tests the placement of A in position 2 and M in position 1 while introducing Z.

<guess>MAIZE</guess>",MAIZE,"From the new feedback on AMIDE:
- A is still in the word but NOT in position 1 (so it must be in position 4).
- M is in the word but in the wrong position (so it must be in position 2 or 3).
- I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- D is not in the word.
- E is confirmed in position 5.

So the pattern so far is:
- Position 3: I
- Position 5: E
- Position 4: A (since A cannot be in 1,2,3,5 and must be used)
- Position 2 or 3: M (but 3 is already I, so M must be in position 2)

Therefore the word must be: _ M I A E

The only common 5-letter word that fits is ""MIAEA"" but that's not valid. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, the pattern is:
- Position 4: A
- Position 3: I
- Position 5: E
- Position 2: M (since M can't be in 3)
- Position 1: ?

But position 1 is still unknown. We need a consonant that hasn't been ruled out (S,L,T,C,R,N,D). Let's try G.

Word: G M I A E → ""GMIAE"" not valid. 

Wait, the pattern is _ M I A E. Common words ending in ""IAE"" are rare. Let me think differently.

Actually, the pattern is:
- Position 4: A
- Position 3: I
- Position 5: E
- Position 2: M (since M must be in 2 or 3, but 3 is I)
- Position 1: ?

So the word is _ M I A E. The only valid word fitting this is ""MIAEA"" which isn't valid. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback:
- AMIDE: A(-) M(-) I(✓) D(x) E(✓)
This means:
- A is in the word but not in position 1
- M is in the word but not in position 2
- I is in position 3
- E is in position 5
- D is not in the word

So positions:
1: ?
2: ?
3: I
4: ?
5: E

From AMIDE we also learned that A is not in position 1, so A must be in position 4 (since it can't be in 2 or 3, and 5 is E).

So pattern: _ _ I A E

From CRANE and SLATE we know:
- M is in the word but not in position 2
- So M must be in position 1 or 4, but 4 is A, so M must be in position 1.

Thus pattern: M _ I A E

The only common 5-letter word fitting this is ""MIAEA"" which isn't valid. This suggests I might have made an error.

Wait, let's list possible words ending in ""IAE"":
- ""MIAEA"" - invalid
- ""PIATE"" - not a word
- ""FIARE"" - not a word

Hmm, this seems problematic. Let me re-examine the feedback:

From AMIDE:
- A(-) - A is in the word but not in position 1
- M(-) - M is in the word but not in position 2
- I(✓) - I is in position 3
- D(x) - D is not in the word
- E(✓) - E is in position 5

Thus:
- Position 3: I
- Position 5: E
- A must be in position 4 (since it can't be in 1,2,3,5)
- M must be in position 1 (since it can't be in 2 and 3,4,5 are taken)
- Position 2: ?

So the word is M _ I A E

Possible consonants left: B, F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

Common words: M B I A E - ""MBIAE"" invalid
M P I A E - ""MPIAE"" invalid
M H I A E - ""MHIAE"" invalid

This suggests I might have misinterpreted the feedback. Let me re-examine:

From AMIDE:
- A(-) - A is in the word but not in position 1
- M(-) - M is in the word but not in position 2
- I(✓) - I is in position 3
- D(x) - D is not in the word
- E(✓) - E is in position 5

Thus:
- Positions 3 and 5 are fixed: I and E
- A must be in position 2 or 4 (since 1 and 5 are excluded, and 3 is I)
- M must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (but 3 is I, so 1 or 4)
- From CRANE feedback: M is in the word but not in position 2
- From SLATE feedback: M is not in the word (but wait, SLATE didn't have M)

Wait, no, SLATE had S,L,A,T,E. CRANE had C,R,A,N,E. AMIDE has A,M,I,D,E.

So M is only confirmed in AMIDE to be in the word but not in position 2.

Thus possible positions for M: 1,3,4
But position 3 is I, so M must be in 1 or 4.

If M is in 1: word is M _ I A E (but A must be in 2 or 4)
If M is in 4: word is _ _ I M E, but then where is A?
