### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Looking at common letters in English, E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C are very frequent. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in one word. 

The word ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This should give me good information about several key letters in the secret word.

We now know:
- E is in the word and is in the 5th position (last letter).
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain A, R, O, S.

I need a 5-letter word ending in E that avoids A, R, O, S.  
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are ruled out).

A strong next guess would use common remaining letters.  
“UNTIE” ends in E but contains I and U, which are still possible.  
However, “UNTIE” has T and I, both of which are common and haven’t been ruled out.  
Another option is “UTILE”, but “UNTIE” uses more common letters.  
Let’s go with “UNTIE”.

From the feedback so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)

   – A, R, O, S are absent.

2. untie → U(x) N(x) T(-) I(x) E(✓)  
   – E is still in the 5th position.  
   – U, N, I are absent.  
   – T is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position.

So the secret word ends with E and contains T somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.

Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, S, U, N, I  
Remaining common consonants: C, D, L, M, P, H, B, G, F, K, etc.  
Remaining vowels: only Y and sometimes E (already placed).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing T, and avoiding the banned letters.

Possible patterns: T _ _ _ E, _ T _ _ E, _ _ T _ E.

Let’s try “TIGER” – but R is banned.  
“THEME” – H, M, E are allowed, T is in position 1.  
Check letters: T, H, E, M, E – no banned letters and T is in position 1.

From the latest feedback:

- T is now confirmed in position 1 (✓).
- E is confirmed in position 5 (✓).
- H and M are NOT in the word (x).
- E in position 3 is marked “-”, meaning there’s another E somewhere else (but we already know position 5 is E). This suggests the word has two E’s: one at position 5 and another somewhere in positions 2 or 4.

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, plus the second E.

So the pattern is: T _ E _ E or T _ _ E E.

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting one of these patterns. Let’s list possibilities:

Looking at valid words, “TWEET” fits T _ _ E E and uses allowed letters (T, W, E, E). It also avoids all banned letters (A, R, O, S, U, N, I, H, M).

Therefore, “TWEET” is a strong next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Looking at common letters in English, E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C are very frequent. I'll try to include as many of these as possible in one word. 

The word ""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - all very common letters. This should give me good information about several key letters in the secret word.

<|im_start|>assistant
We now know:
- E is in the word and is in the 5th position (last letter).
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and does not contain A, R, O, S.

I need a 5-letter word ending in E that avoids A, R, O, S.  
Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (since A and O are ruled out).

A strong next guess would use common remaining letters.  
“UNTIE” ends in E but contains I and U, which are still possible.  
However, “UNTIE” has T and I, both of which are common and haven’t been ruled out.  
Another option is “UTILE”, but “UNTIE” uses more common letters.  
Let’s go with “UNTIE”.

From the feedback so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   – E is fixed in the 5th position.  
   – A, R, O, S are absent.

2. untie → U(x) N(x) T(-) I(x) E(✓)  
   – E is still in the 5th position.  
   – U, N, I are absent.  
   – T is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position.

So the secret word ends with E and contains T somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 4.

Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, S, U, N, I  
Remaining common consonants: C, D, L, M, P, H, B, G, F, K, etc.  
Remaining vowels: only Y and sometimes E (already placed).

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing T, and avoiding the banned letters.

Possible patterns: T _ _ _ E, _ T _ _ E, _ _ T _ E.

Let’s try “TIGER” – but R is banned.  
“THEME” – H, M, E are allowed, T is in position 1.  
Check letters: T, H, E, M, E – no banned letters and T is in position 1.

THEME seems like a good third guess.

1. Position 1: T (✓) – locked in.
2. Position 5: E (✓) – locked in.
3. The word must contain another E somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 3 and 4 in prior guesses both gave “-” to E, indicating the second E is not there, so the second E must be in position 2).
4. Letters ruled out entirely: A, R, O, S, U, N, I, H, M, W.
5. Letters still allowed: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z, plus the second E in position 2.
