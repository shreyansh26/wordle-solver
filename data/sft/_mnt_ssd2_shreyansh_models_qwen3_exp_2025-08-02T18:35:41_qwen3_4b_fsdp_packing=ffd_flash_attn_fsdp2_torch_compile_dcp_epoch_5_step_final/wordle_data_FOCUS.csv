For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - covers several common letters.
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - also good.
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - very common letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should give good initial information about the word's composition.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 3rd).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 4th).
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has O and S somewhere other than positions 3 and 4.
2. Does not have A, R, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, E are out and O is confirmed).

Possible candidates:
- ""POINT"" – but has I and N, but O is in position 2 (allowed) and S is not present.
- ""SLOTH"" – has S in position 1 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), but T and H are less common.
- ""MOSHI"" – has S in position 3 (forbidden, since S was in position 4 before).
- ""SOUND"" – has S in position 1 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), but U, N, D are okay.
- ""CLOPS"" – has S in position 5 (allowed), O in position 3 (forbidden, since O was in position 3 before).
- ""SULKY"" – has S in position 1 (allowed), O is not present (need O).
- ""SLOTH"" seems best so far: S in position 1 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), L, T, H are common.

But let me check another: ""SOILY"" – has S in position 1 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), I, L, Y. This seems good.

2. SOILY → S(-) O(✓) I(x) L(x) Y(x)
   - O is in position 2 (✓), so O = _ O _ _ _
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (because the feedback was “-” instead of “✓”).
   - I, L, Y are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:

- Must contain S somewhere, but NOT in positions 1 or 4.
- Cannot contain A, R, E, I, L, Y.

  - Need two consonants from remaining pool.
  - Example: B O S _ _ → BOSUN, BOSKI (but K is allowed), etc.
  - But BOSUN has U, which is allowed (vowels left: U).
  - BOSKI: B, O, S, K, I – but I is forbidden.
  - TOSCA: C is allowed, but A is forbidden.
  - MOSHS: H is allowed, but double S is okay.
  - POSSE: E is forbidden.
  - POSHM: M is allowed, but double H is okay.
  - DOSHS: D, O, S, H, S – valid.

- If S is in position 5: _ O _ _ S
  - Need two consonants from remaining pool.
  - Example: B O N S → BONDS, BONDS is valid.

  - M O N S → Mons is a name, but plural MONS is okay.
  - P O N S → PONDS, valid.
  - T O N S → TONS (plural), valid.
  - D O N S → DONS, valid.

Among these, “BONDS” is a common word, uses allowed letters, and fits the pattern _ O _ _ S with S in position 5 (allowed). It also introduces B, N, D which are new letters to test.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - covers several common letters.
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - also good.
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - very common letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 3rd).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 4th).
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has O and S somewhere other than positions 3 and 4.
2. Does not have A, R, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, E are out and O is confirmed).

Possible candidates:
- ""POINT"" – but has I and N, but O is in position 2 (allowed) and S is not present.
- ""SLOTH"" – has S in position 1 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), but T and H are less common.
- ""MOSHI"" – has S in position 3 (forbidden, since S was in position 4 before).
- ""SOUND"" – has S in position 1 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), but U, N, D are okay.
- ""CLOPS"" – has S in position 5 (allowed), O in position 3 (forbidden, since O was in position 3 before).
- ""SULKY"" – has S in position 1 (allowed), O is not present (need O).
- ""SLOTH"" seems best so far: S in position 1 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), L, T, H are common.

But let me check another: ""SOILY"" – has S in position 1 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), I, L, Y. This seems good.

I'll go with ""SOILY"" as it keeps S and O in new positions and introduces new common letters.

Guess 2: SOILY -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) I(x) L(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - Word does NOT contain A, R, E.
   - Word DOES contain O and S, but:
     – O is NOT in position 3.
     – S is NOT in position 4.

2. SOILY → S(-) O(✓) I(x) L(x) Y(x)
   - O is in position 2 (✓), so O = _ O _ _ _
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (because the feedback was “-” instead of “✓”).
   - I, L, Y are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ _
- Must contain S somewhere, but NOT in positions 1 or 4.
- Cannot contain A, R, E, I, L, Y.
- Allowed letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Possible positions for S:
- Position 3 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are forbidden).

Let’s list possible words:

- If S is in position 3: _ O S _ _
  - Need two consonants from remaining pool.
  - Example: B O S _ _ → BOSUN, BOSKI (but K is allowed), etc.
  - But BOSUN has U, which is allowed (vowels left: U).
  - BOSKI: B, O, S, K, I – but I is forbidden.
  - TOSCA: C is allowed, but A is forbidden.
  - MOSHS: H is allowed, but double S is okay.
  - POSSE: E is forbidden.
  - POSHM: M is allowed, but double H is okay.
  - DOSHS: D, O, S, H, S – valid.

- If S is in position 5: _ O _ _ S
  - Need two consonants from remaining pool.
  - Example: B O N S → BONDS, BONDS is valid.
  - C O N S → CONDS (plural of cond), valid.
  - M O N S → Mons is a name, but plural MONS is okay.
  - P O N S → PONDS, valid.
  - T O N S → TONS (plural), valid.
  - D O N S → DONS, valid.

Among these, “BONDS” is a common word, uses allowed letters, and fits the pattern _ O _ _ S with S in position 5 (allowed). It also introduces B, N, D which are new letters to test.

Let’s go with BONDS.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - covers several common letters.
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - also good.
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - very common letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should give good initial information about the word's composition.

From POOPS feedback:
- First O is in position 2 (✓) – already fixed.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - covers several common letters.
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - also good.
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - very common letters.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), which should give good initial information about the word's composition.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 3rd).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 4th).
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So the secret word:
- Contains O and S, but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain A, R, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has O and S somewhere other than positions 3 and 4.
2. Does not have A, R, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good consonants left to try: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, E are out and O is confirmed).

Possible candidates:
- ""POINT"" – but has I and N, but O is in position 2 (allowed) and S is not present.
- ""SLOTH"" – has S in position 1 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), but T and H are less common.
- ""MOSHI"" – has S in position 3 (forbidden, since S was in position 4 before).
- ""SOUND"" – has S in position 1 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), but U, N, D are okay.
- ""CLOPS"" – has S in position 5 (allowed), O in position 3 (forbidden, since O was in position 3 before).
- ""SULKY"" – has S in position 1 (allowed), O is not present (need O).
- ""SLOTH"" seems best so far: S in position 1 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), L, T, H are common.

But let me check another: ""SOILY"" – has S in position 1 (allowed), O in position 2 (allowed), I, L, Y. This seems good.

I'll go with ""SOILY"" as it keeps S and O in new positions and introduces new common letters.

Guess 2: SOILY -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) I(x) L(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - Word does NOT contain A, R, E.
   - Word DOES contain O and S, but:
     – O is NOT in position 3.
     – S is NOT in position 4.

2. SOILY → S(-) O(✓) I(x) L(x) Y(x)
   - O is in position 2 (✓), so O = _ O _ _ _
   - S is in the word but NOT in position 1 (because the feedback was “-” instead of “✓”).
   - I, L, Y are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ _
- Must contain S somewhere, but NOT in positions 1 or 4.
- Cannot contain A, R, E, I, L, Y.
- Allowed letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

Possible positions for S:
- Position 3 or 5 (since 1 and 4 are forbidden).

Let’s list possible words:

- If S is in position 3: _ O S _ _
  - Need two consonants from remaining pool.
  - Example: B O S _ _ → BOSUN, BOSKI (but K is allowed), etc.
  - But BOSUN has U, which is allowed (vowels left: U).
  - BOSKI: B, O, S, K, I – but I is forbidden.
  - TOSCA: C is allowed, but A is forbidden.
  - MOSHS: H is allowed, but double S is okay.
  - POSSE: E is forbidden.
  - POSHM: M is allowed, but double H is okay.
  - DOSHS: D, O, S, H, S – valid.

- If S is in position 5: _ O _ _ S
  - Need two consonants from remaining pool.
  - Example: B O N S → BONDS, BONDS is valid.
  - C O N S → CONDS (plural of cond), valid.
  - M O N S → Mons is a name, but plural MONS is okay.
  - P O N S → PONDS, valid.
  - T O N S → TONS (plural), valid.
  - D O N S → DONS, valid.

Among these, “BONDS” is a common word, uses allowed letters, and fits the pattern _ O _ _ S with S in position 5 (allowed). It also introduces B, N, D which are new letters to test.

Let’s go with BONDS.

Let’s update the constraints after Guess 4 (POOPS → P(x) O(✓) O(-) P(x) S(✓)).

Known facts so far:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ S  (O in position 2, S in position 5)
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E, I, L, Y, B, N, D, P
- Letters still allowed for positions 1, 3, 4: C, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z

From POOPS feedback:
- First O is in position 2 (✓) – already fixed.
- Second O is in position 3 (feedback: -) – so O is NOT in position 3.
- P is not in the word (x in positions 1 and 4).

Thus the word must be:
_ O _ _ S
with O allowed only in position 2, and positions 1,3,4 must be filled from {C,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Z}.

Possible patterns:
- C O _ _ S
- F O _ _ S
- G O _ _ S
- H O _ _ S
- J O _ _ S
- K O _ _ S
- M O _ _ S
- Q O _ _ S
- T O _ _ S
- U O _ _ S
- V O _ _ S
- W O _ _ S
- X O _ _ S
- Z O _ _ S

Looking for common English words:
- C O _ _ S → COCKS (C,K allowed), COOTS (double O), COBYS (B forbidden), COGGS (G allowed), COXES (E forbidden)
- F O _ _ S → FOIST (I forbidden), FOGGY (G,Y allowed but Y forbidden), FOCUS (C,U allowed), FOLKS (L allowed but L forbidden)
- G O _ _ S → GOOFY (Y forbidden), GOLFS (L forbidden), GUMPS (M,P allowed but P forbidden), GONKS (N,K allowed but N forbidden)
- H O _ _ S → HOSTS (T,S allowed), HOMES (E forbidden), HOOPS (P forbidden)
- J O _ _ S → JOINT (I,N forbidden), JOKES (E forbidden)
- K O _ _ S → KNOWS (N,W allowed but N forbidden)
- M O _ _ S → MOMOS (M allowed), MOMBS (B forbidden), MOLDS (L,D forbidden)
- Q O _ _ S → QUOBS (B forbidden), QUOFS (F allowed but F is in QOFS which is obscure)
- T O _ _ S → TOWNS (N,W allowed but N forbidden), TOPSS (invalid), TONKS (N,K allowed but N forbidden)
- U O _ _ S → UMBOS (B forbidden)
- V O _ _ S → VOLOS (L allowed but L forbidden)
- W O _ _ S → WOMBS (B forbidden)
- X O _ _ S → XEROX (X allowed but E,R,X forbidden)
- Z O _ _ S → ZONKS (N,K allowed but N forbidden)

Valid common words left:
- HOSTS (H,O,S,T,S) – uses H,T which are allowed.
- MOMOS (M,O,M,O,S) – uses M allowed, but double O is allowed only if one O is in position 2 and the other not in position 3. Since O is not in position 3, this is acceptable.
- TOWNS – N is forbidden.
- HOSTS seems the most common.

Let’s verify HOSTS:
- H O S T S
- O in position 2 (✓)
- S in position 5 (✓)
- Letters used: H, O, S, T – all allowed.
- No forbidden letters.

Therefore, HOSTS is a valid guess.

- T(x) → T is NOT in the word.
- S(✓) → S is in position 5 (already known).

So the pattern is still _ O _ _ S, and we now know:

- Allowed letters for positions 1, 3, 4: C, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We also know:
- O is NOT in position 3 (from POOPS feedback).
- S is in position 5.

Looking for common English words that fit _ O _ _ S with only the allowed letters:

Possible patterns:
- C O _ _ S → COCKS (C,K allowed), COGGS (G allowed)
- F O _ _ S → FOCUS (C,U allowed), FOGGY (G,Y allowed but Y forbidden)

- MOMOS (M,O,M,O,S) – uses M allowed, but double O is allowed since only one O is in position 2.

Among these, FOCUS is a very common word and uses F, C, U which are all allowed.

Let’s verify FOCUS:
- F O C U S
- O in position 2 (✓)
- S in position 5 (✓)
- Letters: F, O, C, U, S – none are forbidden.

Therefore, FOCUS is the best next guess.
