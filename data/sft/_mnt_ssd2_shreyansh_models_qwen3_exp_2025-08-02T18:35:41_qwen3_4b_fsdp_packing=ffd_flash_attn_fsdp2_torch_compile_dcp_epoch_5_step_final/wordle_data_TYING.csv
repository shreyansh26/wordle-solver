### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common)
- O (common)
- S (common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give me good information about multiple letters at once, helping narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   Eliminates A, R, O, S, E entirely.

2. until → U(x) N(-) T(-) I(-) L(x)  
   - U and L are not in the word.  
   - N, T, I are in the word but in wrong positions.

So the secret word contains the letters N, T, I (each somewhere other than their current spots) and does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, L.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses N, T, I (each at least once).  
- Avoids A, R, O, S, E, U, L.  
- Puts N, T, I in new positions (since they were marked “-”).

Possible remaining letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to place N, T, I in new positions and fill the rest with allowed letters.

One candidate: “INTID” – but D is allowed and we can check if it’s valid. However, “INTID” isn’t a recognized word.

Another candidate: “TINTY” – but Y is allowed and T, I, N are used. However, “TINTY” repeats T and I, which might not be optimal.

A better candidate: “WITTY” – but T and Y are allowed, and W, I are new letters. However, this repeats T and Y.

A more balanced choice: “NITTY” – repeats T and Y, but still uses N, I, T.

Let’s try “MINTY”:
- M, I, N, T, Y – all letters are allowed (not in the eliminated set).  
- Contains N, T, I.  
- Positions: I is in position 2 (was in 3 before), N in 3 (was in 1), T in 4 (was in 3), M and Y new.  
This seems valid.

But let’s check if there’s a word that spreads N, T, I more. How about “TINNY”:
- T, I, N, N, Y – repeats N, but uses all required letters.

“TINNY” is a valid word and spreads N, T, I across different positions while introducing Y.

So I’ll go with “TINNY”.

From the three guesses we now know:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
   Eliminates A, R, O, S, E.

2. until → U(x) N(-) T(-) I(-) L(x)  
   - U, L are out.  
   - N, T, I are in the word but in wrong positions.

3. tinny → T(✓) I(-) N(-) N(✓) Y(-)  
   - T is in position 1 (✓).  
   - Second N is in position 4 (✓).  
   - I and Y are in the word but in wrong positions.  
   - The first N (position 3) is in the word but in the wrong position.

So the secret word:
- Starts with T, ends with N (positions 1 and 4 fixed).  
- Contains I and Y somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5 (but not where they were in previous guesses).  
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S, E, U, L.

Current skeleton: T _ _ N _

We need to place I and Y in the remaining slots (positions 2, 3, 5) without repeating letters already used.  
Allowed letters (not yet eliminated): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since I and Y must both appear, and we have three slots left, we need one more distinct letter.  
Let’s try to pick a common letter for the remaining slot. Good candidates: C, D, H, K, M, P, W.

Let’s test “TYING” – but G is allowed, but we already have T, I, N, Y. This repeats none of the required letters and fits the pattern T Y I N G. However, we know G hasn’t been tested yet, but we don’t have any info against it. But we need to check if it fits the constraints: T(1), Y(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). This uses I in position 3 (was in 2 before, so allowed) and Y in position 2 (was in 5 before, so allowed). This seems valid.

But let’s see if we can find a word that uses the remaining letters more efficiently. Another candidate: “TYING” is valid. Another: “TUNNY” – but U is eliminated. “TINNY” was already tried. “TIPNY” – but P is allowed, but “TIPNY” isn’t a word. “TICKY” – but C is allowed, K is allowed, but we need to check if it’s a word. “TICKY” is a word meaning showing off. But we have T(1), I(2), C(3), K(4), Y(5). But position 4 must be N, so this doesn’t fit.

Wait, the skeleton is T _ _ N _, so position 4 is N. So the word must be T _ _ N _. So the remaining letters to place are I and Y in positions 2, 3, or 5, and one more letter in one of those positions. So the word must contain I and Y and one more letter (not yet eliminated).

Possible structure: T I Y N _ – but we need a 5-letter word. Or T I _ N Y, T _ I N Y, T Y I N _, T Y _ N I, etc.

Let’s list possibilities:

- T I _ N Y – need a letter in position 3. Possible: T I C N Y – “TICNY” – not a word. T I D N Y – not a word. T I B N Y – not a word.

- T _ I N Y – position 2: T B I N Y – “TBINY” – no. T C I N Y – “TCINY” – no. T H I N Y – “THINY” – yes, “THINY” is a word (slender or thin).

- T Y _ N I – position 3: T Y C N I – “TYCNI” – no. T Y D N I – no. T Y H N I – no. T Y K N I – no. T Y P N I – no. T Y M N I – no. T Y W N I – no. T Y V N I – no.

- T _ _ N Y – positions 2 and 3 must contain I and one more letter. Example: T I N N Y – but N is already in position 4. This would be T I N N Y – but N is already fixed in position 4, so this would have two N’s. The feedback for tinny showed two N’s (positions 3 and 4). So the secret word could have two N’s. So “TINNY” is actually the same as tinny, but we already tried tinny. So this would be the same word, which is invalid.

Another candidate: T I D N Y – not a word. T I P N Y – not a word. T I K N Y – not a word. T I G N Y – not a word. T I B N Y – not a word.

Next: T _ I N Y – we saw “THINY” is a word.

“THINY” fits:
- T(1) ✓
- H is new
- I(3) – was in position 2 before, so allowed
- N(4) ✓
- Y(5) – was in position 5 before, but feedback for until showed Y(-), meaning Y is in the word but in wrong position. In until, Y was in position 5, so now it can’t be in 5 again. So “THINY” would put Y in 5 again, which is invalid.

So “THINY” is invalid because Y would be in the same position as before.

Next possibility: T _ _ N I – positions 2 and 3 must contain Y and one more letter, and I must be in 5. But we know I is in the word but in wrong positions. In until, I was in 4, in tinny I was in 2, so I can be in 3 or 5. In tinny, I was in 2 and got (-), so I can be in 3 or 5. In this case, if we put I in 5, then positions 2 and 3 must contain Y and one more letter.

Example: T Y _ N I – position 3: T Y C N I – not a word. T Y D N I – not a word. T Y H N I – not a word. T Y K N I – not a word. T Y M N I – not a word. T Y P N I – not a word. T Y W N I – not a word. T Y V N I – not a word.

Another candidate: T I _ N _ – but we need Y somewhere. So T I Y N _ – but we need a letter in 5. T I Y N _ – possible letters: T I Y N D – not a word. T I Y N K – not a word. T I Y N P – not a word. T I Y N H – not a word. T I Y N C – not a word.

This seems tricky. Let’s step back.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with T
- Has N in position 4
- Contains I and Y in positions 2, 3, or 5 (but not where they were in previous guesses)
- Uses only allowed letters.

Given the constraints, the only viable structure seems to be T _ _ N _ with I and Y in positions 2, 3, or 5, and one more letter.

Let’s list possible words fitting T _ _ N _ that contain I and Y:

- T I N N Y – already tried (tinny)
- T I Y N _ – need a letter in 5, but no valid word
- T Y I N _ – need a letter in 5, but no valid word
- T _ I N Y – need a letter in 2, but Y in 5 is invalid
- T _ Y N I – need a letter in 2, but I in 5 is allowed if Y is in 3

Looking at T _ Y N I – position 2: T B Y N I – not a word. T C Y N I – not a word. T D Y N I – not a word. T F Y N I – not a word. T G Y N I – not a word. T H Y N I – not a word. T J Y N I – not a word. T K Y N I – not a word. T M Y N I – not a word. T P Y N I – not a word. T V Y N I – not a word. T W Y N I – not a word. T X Y N I – not a word. T Z Y N I – not a word.

This is not yielding any results. Let’s consider that the word might have only one N, but feedback for tinny showed two N’s, so it’s possible there are two N’s.

Alternative approach: since we have T(1) and N(4) fixed, and need to place I and Y in positions 2, 3, or 5, and possibly another N.

Possible words:
- T I N N Y – already tried
- T I Y N N – but N is already in 4, and we don’t know if there are two N’s
- T Y I N N – same issue
- T Y N I N – same issue
- T N I Y N – same issue
- T N Y I N – same issue

None of these seem valid except TINNY, which we already tried.

Wait, maybe the word is T I N Y _ – but N is in 4, so T I N Y _ would be T I N Y _, but position 4 is N, so this would be T I N Y _ – but N is in 3, which conflicts with N in 4.

This is perplexing. Let’s try to think of actual 5-letter words starting with T, ending with N, containing I and Y.

Possible words:
- TINGY – but G is allowed, and this is T I N G Y. But N is supposed to be in position 4, so T I N G Y would have N in 3, which conflicts with N in 4.

- TINNY – already tried
- TIGNY – not a word
- TIYNN – not a word
- TYNIN – not a word
- TYNII – not a word
- TYNIF – not a word
- TYNIX – not a word
- TYNIP – not a word
- TYNIT – not a word
- TYNIO – not a word
- TYNIR – not a word
- TYNIS – not a word
- TYNIT – not a word
- TYNIO – not a word
- TYNIR – not a word
- TYNIS – not a word
- TYNIT – not a word
- TYNIO – not a word
- TYNIR – not a word
- TYNIS – not a word
- TYNIT – not a word
- TYNIO – not a word
- TYNIR – not a word
- TYNIS – not a word

This seems impossible. Let’s reconsider the constraints.

We know:
- T is in position 1 (✓)
- N is in position 4 (✓)
- I is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from until: I was in 4, from tinny: I was in 2, so I can be in 3 or 5)
- Y is in the word but not in position 5 (from until: Y was in 5, from tinny: Y was in 5, so Y can be in 2, 3, or 4, but 4 is N, so 2 or 3)

So possible positions:
- I must be in 3 or 5
- Y must be in 2 or 3
- And we have one more letter in the remaining slot.

Let’s list possibilities:

Case 1: I in 3, Y in 2
Word structure: T Y I N _
Need a letter in position 5. Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z
Looking for valid words: T Y I N _ – “TYING” is a word (T Y I N G). This fits:
- T(1) ✓
- Y(2) – was in 5 before, now in 2, allowed
- I(3) – was in 2 before, now in 3, allowed
- N(4) ✓
- G(5) – new letter, allowed

“TYING” is a valid word and satisfies all constraints.

Case 2: I in 5, Y in 2 or 3
Subcase 2a: Y in 2, I in 5
Word structure: T Y _ N I
Need a letter in position 3. Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z
Looking for valid words: T Y C N I – not a word. T Y D N I – not a word. T Y H N I – not a word. T Y K N I – not a word. T Y M N I – not a word. T Y P N I – not a word. T Y V N I – not a word. T Y W N I – not a word. T Y B N I – not a word. T Y F N I – not a word. T Y G N I – not a word. T Y X N I – not a word. T Y Z N I – not a word.

Subcase 2b: Y in 3, I in 5
Word structure: T _ Y N I
Need a letter in position 2. Possible letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, X, Z
Looking for valid words: T B Y N I – not a word. T C Y N I – not a word. T D Y N I – not a word. T F Y N I – not a word. T G Y N I – not a word. T H Y N I – not a word. T J Y N I – not a word. T K Y N I – not a word. T M Y N I – not a word. T P Y N I – not a word. T V Y N I – not a word. T W Y N I – not a word. T X Y N I – not a word. T Z Y N I – not a word.

Thus, the only valid word is “TYING”.

</think>

Based on the feedback, the secret word must:
- Start with T (position 1)
- Have N in position 4
- Contain I and Y, with I not in positions 2 or 3, and Y not in position 5
- Use only allowed letters (not A, R, O, S, E, U, L)

The only valid 5-letter word fitting these constraints is “TYING”.

Thus, the only valid word is “TYING”.Based on the feedback, the secret word must:
- Start with T (position 1)
- Have N in position 4
- Contain I and Y, with I not in positions 2 or 3, and Y not in position 5
- Use only allowed letters (not A, R, O, S, E, U, L)

The only valid 5-letter word fitting these constraints is “TYING”.",Guess 4: tying -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) Y(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓),SUCCESS
