### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want a word that uses common letters and can help us eliminate or confirm as many letters as possible. The goal is to maximize information gain.

Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"" are popular choices. 

Let's choose ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common in English words
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

- ""EARLY"" – E(1) is ok, A(2) is ok, R(3) is ok, L(new), Y(new). This satisfies all constraints: A not 1st (it’s 2nd), R not 2nd (it’s 3rd), E not 5th (it’s 1st). No O or S.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after two guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word:  
- O, S, L (from AROSE and EARLY feedback)

Letters that ARE in the word:  
- A, R, E, Y (from the “-” and “✓” marks)

Exact positional constraints so far:

1. First letter:  
   - A(-) → A is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   - E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   → Position 1 is NOT A or E.

2. Second letter:  
   - R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   → Position 2 is NOT R.

3. Third letter:  
   - R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   → Position 3 is NOT R.  
   - A(-) → A is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
   → Position 3 is NOT A.

4. Fourth letter:  
   - L(x) → L is not in the word (already known).  
   → No constraint yet from L(x) on other letters.

5. Fifth letter:  
   - Y(✓) → Y is in the word and IS in position 5.  
   So the word ends with Y.

Summary of constraints:
- Word ends in Y.
- Contains A, R, E somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but 5 is already Y).
- Does NOT contain O, S, L.
- Position 1: not A or E.
- Position 2: not R.
- Position 3: not R or A.

Possible letters left: A, R, E, Y (with Y fixed at 5), plus other consonants that haven’t been ruled out.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with Y.
- Uses A, R, E in positions 1-4, respecting the positional bans.
- Uses no O, S, L.

Candidate structure: _ _ _ _ Y

Let’s try to place A, R, E:

- Position 1: cannot be A or E → must be R or another consonant.
- Position 2: cannot be R → could be A or E or another consonant.
- Position 3: cannot be R or A → could be E or another consonant.
- Position 4: could be any of A, R, E or another consonant.

One promising arrangement:
- Position 1: R (allowed, since only A and E are banned from pos 1)
- Position 2: A (allowed, since only R is banned from pos 2)
- Position 3: E (allowed, since only R and A are banned from pos 3)
- Position 4: needs a consonant that hasn’t been used (we haven’t used B, C, D, F, G, H, etc.)
- Position 5: Y (fixed)

So we need a word like R A E _ Y. The missing letter must be a consonant not yet ruled out.

Possible consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, etc.

Let’s try R A E B Y → “RAEBY” – not a valid English word.

R A E C Y → “RAECY” – invalid.

R A E D Y → “RAEDY” – invalid.

R A E F Y → “RAEFY” – invalid.

R A E G Y → “RAEGY” – invalid.

R A E H Y → “RAEHY” – invalid.

R A E K Y → “RAEKY” – invalid.

R A E M Y → “RAEMY” – invalid.

R A E W Y → “RAEWY” – invalid.

R A E X Y → “RAEXY” – invalid.

R A E Z Y → “RAEZ Y” – invalid.

Hmm, none of these are valid. Let’s try a different arrangement.

Alternative arrangement:
- Position 1: must be R or another consonant (since A and E are banned).
- Position 2: could be E (since only R is banned).
- Position 3: could be A (since only R is banned).
- Position 4: could be R or E or A or another consonant.

Let’s try:
- Position 1: R
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: needs a consonant
- Position 5: Y

So we need R E A _ Y. The missing letter must be a consonant not yet ruled out.

Possible consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, etc.

R E A B Y → “REA B Y” – invalid.

R E A C Y → “REA C Y” – invalid.

R E A D Y → “READY” – valid English word!

Let’s check constraints for READY:
- Ends with Y: ✓
- Contains A, R, E: ✓
- No O, S, L: ✓
- Position 1: R – allowed (only A and E banned from pos 1)
- Position 2: E – allowed (only R banned from pos 2)
- Position 3: A – allowed (only R banned from pos 3)
- Position 4: D – new consonant, not ruled out
- Position 5: Y – matches ✓

This satisfies every constraint.
