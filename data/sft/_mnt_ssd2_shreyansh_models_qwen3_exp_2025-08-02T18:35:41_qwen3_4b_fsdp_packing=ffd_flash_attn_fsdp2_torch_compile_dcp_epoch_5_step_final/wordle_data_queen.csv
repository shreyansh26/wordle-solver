### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give me good coverage of potential letters in the secret word and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Let's consolidate what we now know after the three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all (x feedback):
A, R, O, S, T, I, C, H

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown (- feedback):
E, U, N

Position restrictions so far:
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (from UNTIE and AROSE).
- U cannot be in position 1 (from UNTIE) or 3 (from CHUNE).
- N cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (from UNTIE and CHUNE).

So:
- E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- U must be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- N must be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

We still need two more letters, chosen from the remaining unused common letters that haven't been ruled out. The unused common letters so far are: D, L, M, P, Y, etc.

Let's try to construct a valid word that uses E, U, N exactly once each, plus two new letters, while respecting the positional constraints.

One promising arrangement:
- Put E in position 1.
- Put N in position 3.
- Put U in position 4.
- Then we need two more letters for positions 2 and 5. Good candidates: L and D.

This gives the word ""ELUND"" - but that's not a valid English word. Let's think of valid words.

Another arrangement:
- E in position 2.
- N in position 5.
- U in position 4.
- Need letters for positions 1 and 3. Good candidates: L and D.

This gives ""L E D U N"" - ""LEDUN"" is not valid.

Another arrangement:
- E in position 3.
- N in position 5.
- U in position 2.
- Need letters for positions 1 and 4. Good candidates: L and D.

This gives ""L U E D N"" - ""LUEDN"" is not valid.

Another arrangement:
- E in position 2.
- N in position 1.
- U in position 5.
- Need letters for positions 3 and 4. Good candidates: L and D.

Let's try with M instead of L and D:
- E in position 2.
- N in position 1.
- U in position 5.
- Letters for 3 and 4: M and D.

This gives ""N E M D U"" - ""NEMDU"" is not valid.

Another arrangement:
- E in position 1.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give me good coverage of potential letters in the secret word and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter E, but not in the 5th position.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has E somewhere other than position 5.
2. Uses none of A, R, O, S.
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, L, N, I, C, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

A strong candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- Uses U, N, T, I, E (none of A, R, O, S).
- Places E in position 4 (not 5), satisfying the feedback.
- Uses several high-frequency letters (U, N, T, I, E).

- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- T is NOT in the word (x).
- I is NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Must contain E, U, N (each in a different position than before).
- Must NOT contain A, R, O, S, T, I.
- E was in position 5 in AROSE and in position 4 in UNTIE → E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
- U was in position 1 → U cannot be in position 1.
- N was in position 2 → N cannot be in position 2.

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out): C, D, H, L, M, P, Y, etc.

I need a 5-letter word that uses E, U, N exactly once each, and two other letters from the allowed set, with the positional constraints above.

Let's try to place:
- E: possible positions 1, 2, 3
- U: possible positions 2, 3, 4, 5
- N: possible positions 1, 3, 4, 5

A good candidate is ""CHUNE"":
- Letters: C, H, U, N, E (all allowed, none are A, R, O, S, T, I).
- E is in position 3 (allowed).
- U is in position 3 (allowed, since U can't be in 1, but 3 is fine).
- N is in position 4 (allowed).
- C and H are new common letters.

This satisfies all constraints.

From the feedback so far we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, T, I, C, H  
Letters that ARE in the word (but in the wrong positions):  
- E (cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5)  
- U (cannot be in position 2)  
- N (cannot be in positions 2 or 4)  

So the word must contain exactly one each of E, U, N, and two other letters chosen only from the still-allowed set: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also have positional restrictions:
- E can only be in position 1 or 2  
- U can be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5  
- N can be in positions 1, 3, 5  

Let’s try to build a word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new common letters.

A good candidate is “FUNEL”:
- F and L are new common letters not yet ruled out.
- Letters: F, U, N, E, L – all allowed.
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- U is in position 2 (allowed, since U’s restriction only bans position 2 in CHUNE, not in other guesses).
- N is in position 3 (allowed).
- No duplicates, and no forbidden letters.

This seems valid.

- N is in position 4 (allowed).
- C and H are new common letters.

This satisfies all constraints.

From the feedback so far we know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: A, R, O, S, T, I, C, H  
Letters that ARE in the word (but in the wrong positions):  
- E (cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5)  
- U (cannot be in position 2)  
- N (cannot be in positions 2 or 4)  

So the word must contain exactly one each of E, U, N, and two other letters chosen only from the still-allowed set: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also have positional restrictions:
- E can only be in position 1 or 2  
- U can be in positions 1, 3, 4, 5  
- N can be in positions 1, 3, 5  

Let’s try to build a word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new common letters.

A good candidate is “FUNEL”:
- F and L are new common letters not yet ruled out.
- Letters: F, U, N, E, L – all allowed.
- E is in position 2 (allowed).
- U is in position 2 (allowed, since U’s restriction only bans position 2 in CHUNE, not in other guesses).
- N is in position 3 (allowed).
- No duplicates, and no forbidden letters.

This seems valid.

From the latest feedback on FUNEL:

- F is NOT in the word (x).
- U is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) → U is in position 2.
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → N cannot be in position 3.
- E is in the word AND in the correct position (✓) → E is in position 4.
- L is NOT in the word (x).

So far we know:
- Positions 2 = U, 4 = E.
- Letters in word: U, N, E (each once).
- Letters NOT in word: A, R, O, S, T, I, C, H, F, L.
- Remaining allowed letters: B, D, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- _ U _ E _
- Must contain N somewhere (positions 1, 3, or 5).
- Cannot use any forbidden letters.

Let’s try to place N:
- If N is in position 1: N U _ E _ → need two more letters (positions 3 and 5) from allowed set.
- If N is in position 3: _ U N E _ → need letters for 1 and 5.
- If N is in position 5: _ U _ E N → need letters for 1 and 3.

A common word that fits is “NUDGE”:
- N U D E G → positions: N(1), U(2), D(3), E(4), G(5).
- Letters: N, U, D, E, G – all allowed.
- N is in position 1 (allowed).
- U and E are in correct positions.
- D and G are new common letters.

This seems valid.
