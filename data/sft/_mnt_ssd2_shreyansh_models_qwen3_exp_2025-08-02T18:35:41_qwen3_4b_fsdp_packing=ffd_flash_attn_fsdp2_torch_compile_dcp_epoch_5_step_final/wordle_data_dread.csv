### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which are very common
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This gives me a good chance of hitting several letters in the secret word early on, providing valuable information for subsequent guesses.

From the two pieces of feedback we now have:

1. arose → A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - R is fixed in position 2.
   - A and E are in the word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
   - O and S are not in the word.

2. tread → T(x) R(✓) E(✓) A(✓) D(✓)
   - R is still in position 2 (consistent).
   - E is in position 3 (so E = position 3).
   - A is in position 4 (so A = position 4).
   - D is in the word but not in position 5 (so D must be in position 1 or 4, but position 4 is already A, so D must be in position 1).
   - T is not in the word.

So the pattern so far is:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: ?

We know the word must be D R E A _ and the missing letter (position 5) must be:
- Not O or S (from earlier feedback).
- Not T (from tread feedback).
- Not any letter already used in positions 1-4 (D, R, E, A).

Looking at common 5-letter words that fit D R E A _:
- DREAD (but D is already in position 1, so this would repeat D, which is allowed but we already have D confirmed)
- However, DREAD would have D in position 5, but we know D is in the word and not in position 5 (from tread feedback: D(✓) means D is in the word but not in position 5). Therefore D must be in position 1, so the word is D R E A _ with position 5 unknown.

Possible letters for position 5 (not O, S, T, D, R, E, A):
- Common letters left: B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common words:
- DREAR (but R is already in position 2, so this would have two Rs, which is possible but not common)
- DREAD is invalid because D would be in position 5, but we know D is not in position 5
- DREAM - fits the pattern D R E A M, and M is not in any previous feedback as excluded.

Checking DREAM:
- D(1), R(2), E(3), A(4), M(5)
- All letters are consistent with previous feedback:
  - D is in position 1 (not 5, so okay)
  - R is in position 2 (matches)
  - E is in position 3 (matches)

  - M is new and not excluded.

Therefore, the next logical guess is DREAM.

Checking DREAM:
- D(1), R(2), E(3), A(4), M(5)
- All letters are consistent with previous feedback:
  - D is in position 1 (not 5, so okay)
  - R is in position 2 (matches)
  - E is in position 3 (matches)
  - A is in position 4 (matches)
  - M is new and not excluded.

Therefore, the next logical guess is DREAM.

From the feedback so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   - R is fixed in position 2.
   - A and E are in the word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
   - O and S are not in the word.

2. tread → T(x) R(✓) E(✓) A(✓) D(✓)
   - R is in position 2 (consistent).
   - E is in position 3 (so E = position 3).
   - A is in position 4 (so A = position 4).
   - D is in the word but not in position 5 (so D must be in position 1).
   - T is not in the word.

3. dream → D(✓) R(✓) E(✓) A(✓) M(x)
   - D is in position 1 (consistent).
   - R is in position 2 (consistent).
   - E is in position 3 (consistent).
   - A is in position 4 (consistent).
   - M is not in the word.

So the pattern is now:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: ?

We need a 5-letter word that starts with ""DREA"" and has a letter in position 5 that is **not** O, S, T, M, or any of the letters already used (D, R, E, A). 

Looking at common English words:
- DREAD (but D is already in position 1, and we know D is not in position 5)
- DREAM (M is excluded)
- DREAR (R is already in position 2, so this would have R in position 5 as well, but we don't know if R is allowed in position 5)
- DRECK (C is possible, but not common)
- DREEL (L is possible)
- DREED (D is already in position 1, so this would have D in position 5 which is invalid)

The most likely common word left is ""DREAD"" but since D is already in position 1 and we know D is not in position 5, this seems contradictory. However, ""DREAD"" has D in position 1 and 5, but we know D is only confirmed in position 1. The feedback for ""dream"" only told us D is in position 1, not necessarily that it can't be in position 5. 

But looking back at ""tread"" feedback: D(✓) means D is in the word but not in position 5. So D must be in position 1. Therefore the word must be D R E A _ with position 5 being a new letter.

The only common word that fits is ""DREAD"" but since D is confirmed in position 1 and not in 5, this seems like the only possibility. However, ""DREAD"" would have D in position 5 which is invalid. 

Looking again, the next possible word is ""DRECK"" but C is less common. Another possibility is ""DREEL"". 

But considering common words, ""DREAD"" seems to be the intended word, despite the apparent contradiction. It's possible that the feedback was misinterpreted. Rechecking:
- In ""tread"" feedback: D(✓) means D is in the word but not in position 5 (so D must be in position 1)
- In ""dream"" feedback: D(✓) confirms D is in position 1 (consistent)

Therefore, the word must be D R E A _ with position 5 being a new letter. The most common word left is ""DREAD"" but since D can't be in position 5, this seems impossible. 

Realizing that ""DREAD"" would have D in position 1 and 5, but we know D is not in position 5, this suggests the word must be ""DREAR"" (R in position 5), but this seems less likely. 

However, the only valid word fitting the pattern is ""DREAD"" despite the apparent contradiction, suggesting the word is ""DREAD"". 

But since D is confirmed in position 1 and not in 5, the word must be ""DREAD"" with D in position 1 and 5, which contradicts the feedback. 

Re-evaluating, the correct word must be ""DREAD"" as it's the only common word starting with DREA, and the feedback might imply D is in position 1 only. 

Given the constraints, the word must be ""DREAD"".
</think>

The feedback shows that positions 1-4 are locked as D R E A, and position 5 must be a letter not yet ruled out (no O, S, T, M). The only common English word fitting D R E A _ is ""DREAD"".
