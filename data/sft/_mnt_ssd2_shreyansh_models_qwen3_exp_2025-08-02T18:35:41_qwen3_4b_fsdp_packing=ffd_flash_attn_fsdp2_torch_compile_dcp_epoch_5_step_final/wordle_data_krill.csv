### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English 5-letter words are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 of these common letters to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. _ R _ _ _  (R is fixed in 2nd position)
2. I is in the word but not in 3rd position (I got ✓ in 3rd position in TRICK, but the feedback says I(✓), which actually means I is in the word and in the correct position. Wait, let me re-read carefully.

Wait, the feedback for TRICK is:
T(x) R(✓) I(✓) C(x) K(-)

Ah, so:
- T: not in the word
- R: correct position (2nd letter)
- I: correct position (3rd letter)
- C: not in the word
- K: in the word but not in 5th position

So the pattern so far is:
_ R I _ K  (but K can't be in 5th, so K must be in 4th position)

So the word must be _ R I K _ ?

But let me check again:
- R is 2nd
- I is 3rd
- K is in the word but not 5th, so it must be 4th
So the pattern is _ R I K _

Now we need a 5-letter word that fits _ R I K _ and uses none of A, O, S, E, T, C.

Possible letters left: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common words:
- BRICK: but C is out
- DRINK: C is out
- FRISK: S is out
- GRINK: not a word
- PRICK: C is out
- TRICK: already used
- WRINK: not a word
- BRISK: S is out
- DRIPS: S is out
- FRISK: S is out
- GRIND: D is allowed
- PRISM: S is out
- TRIMS: S is out
- WRIST: S is out
- GRIM: too short
- BRINY: Y is allowed, but N is allowed
- DRINK: already considered
- PRING: not a word
- CRINK: C is out
- GRIND: fits _ R I N D ?

Wait, _ R I N D would be _ R I N D, but we have K in 4th position, so _ R I K _.

Looking for _ R I K _:
- BRISK: S is out
- CRICK: C is out
- DRINK: C is out
- FRISK: S is out
- GRINK: not a word
- PRICK: C is out
- TRICK: already used
- WRISK: S is out
- BRINK: C is out
- CRINK: C is out
- DRINK: C is out
- PRINK: C is out
- TRINK: T is out
- WRINK: not a word

Hmm, seems like common words are scarce. Maybe K is not in 4th position? But feedback says K is in the word but not in 5th, so it must be 1st, 3rd, or 4th. But 3rd is I, so 1st or 4th.

But we have _ R I _ K from TRICK feedback, but K can't be 5th, so it must be 4th. So the word is _ R I K _.

Looking again:
- BRISK: S is out
- CRICK: C is out
- DRINK: C is out
- FRISK: S is out
- GRINK: not a word
- PRICK: C is out
- TRICK: already used
- WRISK: S is out
- BRINK: C is out
- CRINK: C is out
- DRINK: C is out
- PRINK: C is out
- TRINK: T is out
- WRINK: not a word

This seems problematic. Maybe I misinterpreted the feedback. Let me re-express:

From TRICK:
- T(x) – T is not in the word
- R(✓) – R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter)
- I(✓) – I is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter)
- C(x) – C is not in the word
- K(-) – K is in the word but not in the correct position (it was 5th, so it must be 1st, 4th, or 3rd). But 3rd is I, so K must be 1st or 4th.

So possible patterns:
- K R I _ _  (K 1st, R 2nd, I 3rd)
- _ R I K _  (R 2nd, I 3rd, K 4th)

Looking for valid words:
- K R I _ _: KRIS_ – KRIST? Not common
- _ R I K _: BRINK, CRINK, DRINK, PRINK, TRINK (but T is out), WRINK (not a word)

BRINK: B R I N K – fits _ R I K _, uses B, R, I, N, K. None of A, O, S, E, T, C. This seems valid.

So BRINK is a candidate.

Let me check:
- B: new letter
- R: correct position
- I: correct position
- N: new letter
- K: in word, not 5th (it's 5th here, but feedback said K is in word but not in 5th. Wait, this is a contradiction.)

Oh no, BRINK would put K in 5th position, but TRICK feedback said K is in word but not in 5th. So BRINK is invalid.

This is tricky. Maybe K is in 1st position: K R I _ _
KRIS_ – KRIST? Not a word.

Alternative: maybe I misread the feedback. Let me re-express:

TRICK feedback:
T(x) – T not in word
R(✓) – R correct position (2nd)
I(✓) – I correct position (3rd)
C(x) – C not in word
K(-) – K in word but not in 5th

So K must be 1st or 4th.

If K is 4th: _ R I K _
Possible: B R I K _ – BRISK (S out), D R I K _ – DRISK (not a word), F R I K _ – FRISK (S out), G R I K _ – GRISK (S out), P R I K _ – PRISK (S out), W R I K _ – WRISK (S out)

If K is 1st: K R I _ _
KRIS_ – KRIST? Not a word, KRIPS? Not a word.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe I need to reconsider.

Wait, perhaps the feedback for TRICK was mis-read. Let me re-express:

TRICK:
T(x) – T not in word
R(✓) – R correct position (2nd)
I(✓) – I correct position (3rd)
C(x) – C not in word
K(-) – K in word but not in 5th

So the word is _ R I _ K with K not in 5th, which is impossible because it's 5th. Therefore, K must be in 1st position: K R I _ _

Looking for K R I _ _:
KRISP – S is out
KRINT – not a word
KRIST – not a word
KRULA – not matching

This seems impossible with common words. Maybe the only possibility is that the word is K R I N D? But that's K R I N D, which is not a word.

Alternatively, maybe the word is K R I T _ but T is out.

This suggests that the word must be K R I _ _ with some valid letter. The only plausible word is KRISP, but S is out.

This seems like a contradiction. Let me re-examine the feedback interpretation.

Alternative interpretation: the feedback for TRICK:
- T(x) – T not in word
- R(✓) – R correct position (2nd)
- I(✓) – I correct position (3rd)
- C(x) – C not in word
- K(-) – K in word but not in 5th (so 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th). But 2nd is R, 3rd is I, so 1st or 4th.

So possible patterns:
- K R I _ _  (K 1st, R 2nd, I 3rd)
- _ R I K _  (R 2nd, I 3rd, K 4th)

Looking for valid words:
- K R I _ _: KRIST? Not common
- _ R I K _: BRINK, CRINK, DRINK, PRINK, TRINK (T out), WRINK (not a word)

BRINK is the closest, but K would be 5th, which contradicts feedback. This suggests the word must be K R I _ _.

The only plausible word is KRIST, but that's not valid. 

This indicates that the word must be K R I _ _ and the missing letter must be such that it forms a valid word. The only possible valid word is KRISP, but S is out. 

This seems impossible with the given constraints. Therefore, I must have made an error.

Wait, let me list all possible 5-letter words that fit:
- _ R I _ K with K not in 5th – impossible, so K must be 1st
- K R I _ _

The only valid word fitting this is KRIST (variant spelling of ""christ""), but it's not standard.

This suggests that the word must be K R I _ _ and the missing letter is P, forming KRISP, but S is out.

This seems like a dead end. Let me reconsider the feedback.

Alternative approach: maybe I mis-read the feedback for TRICK. Let me re-express:

TRICK:
T(x) – T not in word
R(✓) – R correct position (2nd)
I(✓) – I correct position (3rd)
C(x) – C not in word
K(-) – K in word but not in 5th

So the word is _ R I _ K with K not in 5th – impossible, so K must be 1st: K R I _ _

Possible words:
- KRIST (not common)
- KRUPS (S out)
- KRILL (L allowed, but 5 letters: KRILL – K R I L L, but that's 5 letters and K is 1st, R 2nd, I 3rd, L 4th, L 5th. This fits all constraints:
  - K is in word, not 5th (it's 1st)
  - R is 2nd (correct)
  - I is 3rd (correct)
  - L is new
  - Second L is new
  - None of A, O, S, E, T, C are used
  - KRILL is a valid word

So KRILL seems to fit all constraints.

Let me verify:
- K: in word, not 5th (it's 1st)
- R: correct position (2nd)
- I: correct position (3rd)
- L: new letter
- L: new letter
And none of the excluded letters appear.

Therefore, KRILL is the logical next guess.
</think>

Based on the feedback so far:
- R is fixed in the 2nd position.
- I is fixed in the 3rd position.
- K is in the word but not in the 5th position, so it must be in the 1st position.
- We need two more letters that are not A, O, S, E, T, C.

The only valid word that fits these constraints is KRILL.

- TRIMS: S is out
- WRIST: S is out
- GRIM: too short
- BRINY: Y is allowed, but N is allowed
- DRINK: already considered
- PRING: not a word
- CRINK: C is out
- GRIND: fits _ R I N D ?

Wait, _ R I N D would be _ R I N D, but we have K in 4th position, so _ R I K _.

Looking for _ R I K _:
- BRISK: S is out
- CRICK: C is out
- DRINK: C is out
- FRISK: S is out
- GRINK: not a word
- PRICK: C is out
- TRICK: already used
- WRISK: S is out
- BRINK: C is out
- CRINK: C is out
- DRINK: C is out
- PRINK: C is out
- TRINK: T is out
- WRINK: not a word

Hmm, seems like common words are scarce. Maybe K is not in 4th position? But feedback says K is in the word but not in 5th, so it must be 1st, 3rd, or 4th. But 3rd is I, so 1st or 4th.

But we have _ R I _ K from TRICK feedback, but K can't be 5th, so it must be 4th. So the word is _ R I K _.

Looking again:
- BRISK: S is out
- CRICK: C is out
- DRINK: C is out
- FRISK: S is out
- GRINK: not a word
- PRICK: C is out
- TRICK: already used
- WRISK: S is out
- BRINK: C is out
- CRINK: C is out
- DRINK: C is out
- PRINK: C is out
- TRINK: T is out
- WRINK: not a word

This seems problematic. Maybe I misinterpreted the feedback. Let me re-express:

From TRICK:
- T(x) – T is not in the word
- R(✓) – R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter)
- I(✓) – I is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter)
- C(x) – C is not in the word
- K(-) – K is in the word but not in the correct position (it was 5th, so it must be 1st, 4th, or 3rd). But 3rd is I, so K must be 1st or 4th.

So possible patterns:
- K R I _ _  (K 1st, R 2nd, I 3rd)
- _ R I K _  (R 2nd, I 3rd, K 4th)

Looking for valid words:
- K R I _ _: KRIS_ – KRIST? Not common
- _ R I K _: BRINK, CRINK, DRINK, PRINK, TRINK (but T is out), WRINK (not a word)

BRINK: B R I N K – fits _ R I K _, uses B, R, I, N, K. None of A, O, S, E, T, C. This seems valid.

So BRINK is a candidate.

Let me check:
- B: new letter
- R: correct position
- I: correct position
- N: new letter
- K: in word, not 5th (it's 5th here, but feedback said K is in word but not in 5th. Wait, this is a contradiction.)

Oh no, BRINK would put K in 5th position, but TRICK feedback said K is in word but not in 5th. So BRINK is invalid.

This is tricky. Maybe K is in 1st position: K R I _ _
KRIS_ – KRIST? Not a word.

Alternative: maybe I misread the feedback. Let me re-express:

TRICK feedback:
T(x) – T not in word
R(✓) – R correct position (2nd)
I(✓) – I correct position (3rd)
C(x) – C not in word
K(-) – K in word but not in 5th

So K must be 1st or 4th.

If K is 4th: _ R I K _
Possible: B R I K _ – BRISK (S out), D R I K _ – DRISK (not a word), F R I K _ – FRISK (S out), G R I K _ – GRISK (S out), P R I K _ – PRISK (S out), W R I K _ – WRISK (S out)

If K is 1st: K R I _ _
KRIS_ – KRIST? Not a word, KRIPS? Not a word.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe I need to reconsider.

Wait, perhaps the feedback for TRICK was mis-read. Let me re-express:

TRICK:
T(x) – T not in word
R(✓) – R correct position (2nd)
I(✓) – I correct position (3rd)
C(x) – C not in word
K(-) – K in word but not in 5th

So the word is _ R I _ K with K not in 5th, which is impossible because it's 5th. Therefore, K must be in 1st position: K R I _ _

Looking for K R I _ _:
KRISP – S is out
KRINT – not a word
KRIST – not a word
KRULA – not matching

This seems impossible with common words. Maybe the only possibility is that the word is K R I N D? But that's K R I N D, which is not a word.

Alternatively, maybe the word is K R I T _ but T is out.

This suggests that the word must be K R I _ _ with some valid letter. The only plausible word is KRISP, but S is out.

This seems like a contradiction. Let me re-examine the feedback interpretation.

Alternative interpretation: the feedback for TRICK:
- T(x) – T not in word
- R(✓) – R correct position (2nd)
- I(✓) – I correct position (3rd)
- C(x) – C not in word
- K(-) – K in word but not in 5th (so 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th). But 2nd is R, 3rd is I, so 1st or 4th.

So possible patterns:
- K R I _ _  (K 1st, R 2nd, I 3rd)
- _ R I K _  (R 2nd, I 3rd, K 4th)

Looking for valid words:
- K R I _ _: KRIST? Not common
- _ R I K _: BRINK, CRINK, DRINK, PRINK, TRINK (T out), WRINK (not a word)

BRINK is the closest, but K would be 5th, which contradicts feedback. This suggests the word must be K R I _ _.

The only plausible word is KRIST, but that's not valid. 

This indicates that the word must be K R I _ _ and the missing letter must be such that it forms a valid word. The only possible valid word is KRISP, but S is out. 

This seems impossible with the given constraints. Therefore, I must have made an error.

Wait, let me list all possible 5-letter words that fit:
- _ R I _ K with K not in 5th – impossible, so K must be 1st
- K R I _ _

The only valid word fitting this is KRIST (variant spelling of ""christ""), but it's not standard.

This suggests that the word must be K R I _ _ and the missing letter is P, forming KRISP, but S is out.

This seems like a dead end. Let me reconsider the feedback.

Alternative approach: maybe I mis-read the feedback for TRICK. Let me re-express:

TRICK:
T(x) – T not in word
R(✓) – R correct position (2nd)
I(✓) – I correct position (3rd)
C(x) – C not in word
K(-) – K in word but not in 5th

So the word is _ R I _ K with K not in 5th – impossible, so K must be 1st: K R I _ _

Possible words:
- KRIST (not common)
- KRUPS (S out)
- KRILL (L allowed, but 5 letters: KRILL – K R I L L, but that's 5 letters and K is 1st, R 2nd, I 3rd, L 4th, L 5th. This fits all constraints:
  - K is in word, not 5th (it's 1st)
  - R is 2nd (correct)
  - I is 3rd (correct)
  - L is new
  - Second L is new
  - None of A, O, S, E, T, C are used
  - KRILL is a valid word

So KRILL seems to fit all constraints.

Let me verify:
- K: in word, not 5th (it's 1st)
- R: correct position (2nd)
- I: correct position (3rd)
- L: new letter
- L: new letter
And none of the excluded letters appear.

Therefore, KRILL is the logical next guess.Based on the feedback so far:
- R is fixed in the 2nd position.
- I is fixed in the 3rd position.
- K is in the word but not in the 5th position, so it must be in the 1st position.
- We need two more letters that are not A, O, S, E, T, C.

The only valid word that fits these constraints is KRILL.",Guess 3: KRILL -> FEEDBACK: K(✓) R(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
