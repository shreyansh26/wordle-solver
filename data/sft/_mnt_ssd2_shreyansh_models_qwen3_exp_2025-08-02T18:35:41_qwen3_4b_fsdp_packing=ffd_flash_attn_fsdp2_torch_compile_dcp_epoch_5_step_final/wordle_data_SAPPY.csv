For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include those with vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. 

I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Common consonant
- E: Most common letter in English

This should give good coverage of frequent letters and positions.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after the three guesses.

1. SLATE → S(✓) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - S is fixed in position 1.
   - A is in the word, but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 (because in SLATE it was in position 3 and got “-”, and in SPICA it was in position 5 and got “-”).
   - Letters L, T, E are out.

2. SHARK → S(✓) H(x) A(-) R(x) K(x)
   - H, R, K are out.
   - A is still in the word but not in position 3 (confirmed again).

3. SPICA → S(✓) P(-) I(x) C(x) A(-)
   - P is in the word but not in position 2.
   - I and C are out.
   - A is again confirmed to be in the word but not in position 5 (because in SPICA it was in position 5 and got “-”).

So the constraints are:
- Word starts with S.
- A is in the word, but cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. That leaves only position 1 for A, but position 1 is already S. This seems impossible… wait, let’s re-examine.

Actually, the feedback says:
- In SLATE, A was in position 3 and got “-” → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- In SPICA, A was in position 5 and got “-” → A is in the word but not in position 5.
- In SHARK, A was in position 3 and got “-” → same info as SLATE.

Therefore, A is in the word but not in positions 3 or 5. Possible positions for A: 2 or 4.

Also:
- P is in the word but not in position 2.
- Letters definitely out: L, T, E, H, R, K, I, C.

So the word looks like:
S _ _ _ _
with A in position 2 or 4, and P somewhere else (not position 2).

Let’s list possible patterns:
Case 1: A in position 2 → S A _ _ _
Case 2: A in position 4 → S _ _ A _

We also know P must appear somewhere, but not in position 2.

Let’s explore Case 1: S A _ _ _
Possible letters left (excluding forbidden): B, D, F, G, J, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
P must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Possible words:
- S A P _ _ : e.g., SAPID (but D allowed), SAPPY (Y allowed), SAPPH (not a word), SAPID, SAPPY.
- S A _ P _ : e.g., SABPA (not a word), SAMBA (B,M allowed), SABPA (invalid), SABRE (R out), etc.
- S A _ _ P : e.g., SABAP (not a word), SAMAP (not a word).

SAPID seems valid:
- S ✓
- A in position 2
- P in position 3
- I and D: I is out, so SAPID is invalid (I is excluded).

SAPPY:
- S ✓
- A in position 2
- P in position 3
- P in position 4
- Y allowed
- No forbidden letters.

SAPPY seems valid.

Case 2: A in position 4 → S _ _ A _
Possible letters left: same as above.
P must be in position 2, 3, or 5 (but not 2 if P is in position 2, but we don’t know yet).

Possible patterns:
- S P _ A _ : e.g., SPAGY (Y allowed, G allowed), SPANK (K out), SPASM (S,M allowed, but S already used), SPAGY (valid word? Not common), SPARX (R,X out), etc.
- S _ P A _ : e.g., SMITH (T out), SNAKY (K out), etc.
- S _ _ A P : e.g., SMOBA (not a word), etc.

SPAGY is obscure, SMOBA invalid. Doesn’t seem promising.

Thus, Case 1 gives us SAPPY as a valid candidate.

Let’s verify SAPPY:
- S ✓
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- P in position 3 (allowed)
- P in position 4 (allowed)
- Y allowed
- No forbidden letters.

Therefore, SAPPY is a strong next guess.
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- S is fixed in position 1.
- A must be in position 2 or 4 (since positions 3, 5 are ruled out).
- P must be in the word but not in position 2.
- Forbidden letters: L, T, E, H, R, K, I, C.

The word must be S _ _ _ _ with A in position 2 or 4 and P elsewhere. The most straightforward valid word is SAPPY.
