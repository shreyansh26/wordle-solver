### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination should give good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every word that contains any of those five letters.  
To maximize information on the next guess, I’ll pick a word with:
- No S, L, A, T, E  
- Common remaining letters (R, I, N, O, U, D, C, etc.)  
- A good vowel mix (I, O, U) and common consonants  

A strong choice is “ROUND”:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination should give good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are NOT in the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every word that contains any of those five letters.  
To maximize information on the next guess, I’ll pick a word with:
- No S, L, A, T, E  
- Common remaining letters (R, I, N, O, U, D, C, etc.)  
- A good vowel mix (I, O, U) and common consonants  

A strong choice is “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D are all still possible.  
- It covers three vowels (O, U) and two common consonants (R, N).  
- No letters from the eliminated set (S, L, A, T, E).  

This should give us new information about five fresh letters.

So far we know:

- Letter confirmed in position 4: N  

Remaining common letters include: I, C, G, H, M, P, Y, B, F, K, V, W, X, Z, J, Q.  
Among these, the most frequent are I, C, G, H, M, P, B, F, K.  

Since N is fixed in the 4th spot, I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has N in position 4.  
2. Uses only letters from the still-possible set.  
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information.  

Looking at common patterns, “BINGO” doesn’t work (O is eliminated). “PINGO” is invalid. “CINCH” has C, I, N, C, H – all still possible and covers several common letters. Let’s try “CINCH”:

C I N C H → N is in position 4, and all letters are still possible.

We now have:

- Positions 2, 4, 5 are locked: I N N Y
- Position 1 is the only unknown, and the letter must be from the still-possible set (alphabet minus all eliminated letters so far).

Letters already eliminated: S, L, A, T, E, R, O, U, D, C, H, M, K, F  
Remaining possible first letters: B, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that starts with one of these letters and has the pattern ? I N N Y.

Common English words fitting ? I N N Y:
- BINGY – but G is allowed, B is allowed
- PINGY – P and G are allowed
- WINGY – W and G are allowed
- JINNY – J is allowed, but JINNY is less common
- GINNY – G is allowed, but GINNY is a name and may not be valid

The most common and valid word here is ""PINGY"". It uses P and G, both of which are still possible.

So the next guess should be PINGY.
