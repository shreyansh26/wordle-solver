### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it has very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and should provide good feedback for narrowing down the possibilities.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – it can’t be in position 2
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – it can’t be in position 3
- N is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – it can’t be in position 5

So we know:
- Letters present: R, A, E
- Letters absent: C, N
- R, A, E must appear somewhere in the new word, but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively.

We need a word that:
- Contains R, A, E
- Does NOT contain C or N
- Places R somewhere other than position 2
- Places A somewhere other than position 3
- Places E somewhere other than position 5

Possible positions for the known letters:
R: positions 1,3,4,5
A: positions 1,2,4,5
E: positions 1,2,3,4

I’ll try to form a word that fits these constraints. One candidate is “RAISE”:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- I (new letter, not yet ruled out)
- S (new letter, not yet ruled out)
- E in position 5 (but E cannot be in position 5, so RAISE is invalid)

Next candidate: “EARLY”
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- L (new)
- Y (new)

This seems valid and gives us new letters to test (L, Y) while respecting all constraints.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Known letters:
- R is in the word and is in the correct position 3 (R at position 3 is ✓).
- A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from CRANE: not 3; from EARLY: not 2).
- E is in the word but not in positions 1, 5 (from CRANE: not 5; from EARLY: not 1).
- L is in the word but not in position 4 (from EARLY: L is -).
- C, N, Y are NOT in the word.

So far we have the pattern:
_ _ R _ _

Letters to place:
A, E, L must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (but respecting the above restrictions):
- A cannot be in 2 or 3 (3 is already R), so A can be in 1, 4, 5.
- E cannot be in 1 or 5, so E can be in 2 or 4.
- L cannot be in 4, so L can be in 1, 2, 5.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits:
- R at position 3
- Contains A, E, L
- Does not contain C, N, Y

Possible candidates:
- A, E, L must fill positions 1,2,4,5 with the above constraints.
- Let's try:
  - Position 1: A
  - Position 2: E
  - Position 4: L
  - Position 5: ?
  - But we need 5 letters, and we have A, E, R, L. Missing one letter.
  - Wait, the word must be 5 letters and must contain A, E, R, L. So the missing letter must be one of the remaining letters not yet ruled out.

Actually, the word must contain A, E, R, L and one more letter (since it's 5 letters). Let's think differently.

We have:
- R at position 3
- Must contain A, E, L in the remaining positions 1,2,4,5 with the restrictions:
  - A not in 2 or 3 (3 is R, so A can be 1,4,5)
  - E not in 1 or 5 (so E can be 2 or 4)
  - L not in 4 (so L can be 1,2,5)

Possible combinations:
1. A in 1, E in 2, L in 5 → word: A E R _ L → need a letter for position 4. But we have A, E, R, L already, so position 4 must be one of these letters again? No, the word must be 5 letters with distinct letters (since we have 4 known letters and need one more). Wait, actually the word can have repeated letters, but we have no info about repeats yet.

But we have only 4 known letters (A, E, R, L) and need one more letter. Let's think of words with R in position 3 and containing A, E, L.

Possible words:
- A, E, R, L plus one more letter (not C, N, Y).
- Example: A, E, R, L, D → ""AERLD"" not a word.
- ""LEARN"" - but N is out.
- ""EARLY"" already tried.
- ""ARLER"" - not a valid word.
- ""ALERT"" - let's check:
  - A at 1 (allowed)
  - L at 2 (allowed)
  - E at 3 - but 3 is R, so invalid.
- ""ELAR"" - too short.
- ""LARGE"" - but G is new, let's check:
  - L A R G E
  - R at 3 ✓
  - A at 2 - but A cannot be at 2 (from EARLY feedback: A is - at 2). So invalid.
- ""REAL"" - too short.
- ""RELAX"" - but X is new, and A at 4 (allowed), E at 2 (allowed), L at 1 (allowed), R at 3 ✓, X new. So RELAX:
  - R E L A X
  - R at 3 ✓
  - E at 2 (allowed)
  - L at 1 (allowed)
  - A at 4 (allowed)
  - X is new letter, not yet ruled out.
  - Contains R, E, L, A and X.
  - Does not contain C, N, Y.
  - Seems valid.

Another candidate: ""TALER"" - but T is new, and:
  - T A L E R
  - R at 5, but must be at 3 - invalid.
- ""LATER"" - R at 4, invalid.
- ""ELATE"" - R missing - invalid.
- ""ARELA"" - R at 3 ✓, A at 1 (allowed), E at 2 (allowed), L at 4 (but L cannot be at 4 from EARLY feedback: L is - at 4). So invalid.
- ""ALERT"" - E at 2 (allowed), R at 3 ✓, L at 1 (allowed), A at 4 (allowed), T new. But E is at 2, which is allowed (E cannot be at 1 or 5). So ALERT seems valid:
  - A L E R T
  - R at 4 - but must be at 3 - invalid.

So the only valid candidate seems RELAX:
- R E L A X
- R at 3 ✓
- E at 2 (allowed)
- L at 1 (allowed)
- A at 4 (allowed)
- X new letter.

Therefore, the next guess is RELAX.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me maximum information about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Some good starting words include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- AUDIO (contains A, U, D, I, O)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it has very common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and should provide good feedback for narrowing down the possibilities.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – it can’t be in position 2
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – it can’t be in position 3
- N is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – it can’t be in position 5

So we know:
- Letters present: R, A, E
- Letters absent: C, N
- R, A, E must appear somewhere in the new word, but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively.

We need a word that:
- Contains R, A, E
- Does NOT contain C or N
- Places R somewhere other than position 2
- Places A somewhere other than position 3
- Places E somewhere other than position 5

Possible positions for the known letters:
R: positions 1,3,4,5
A: positions 1,2,4,5
E: positions 1,2,3,4

I’ll try to form a word that fits these constraints. One candidate is “RAISE”:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- I (new letter, not yet ruled out)
- S (new letter, not yet ruled out)
- E in position 5 (but E cannot be in position 5, so RAISE is invalid)

Next candidate: “EARLY”
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- A in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 3 (allowed)
- L (new)
- Y (new)

This seems valid and gives us new letters to test (L, Y) while respecting all constraints.

Guess 2: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(-) R(✓) L(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Known letters:
- R is in the word and is in the correct position 3 (R at position 3 is ✓).
- A is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (from CRANE: not 3; from EARLY: not 2).
- E is in the word but not in positions 1, 5 (from CRANE: not 5; from EARLY: not 1).
- L is in the word but not in position 4 (from EARLY: L is -).
- C, N, Y are NOT in the word.

So far we have the pattern:
_ _ R _ _

Letters to place:
A, E, L must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 (but respecting the above restrictions):
- A cannot be in 2 or 3 (3 is already R), so A can be in 1, 4, 5.
- E cannot be in 1 or 5, so E can be in 2 or 4.
- L cannot be in 4, so L can be in 1, 2, 5.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits:
- R at position 3
- Contains A, E, L
- Does not contain C, N, Y

Possible candidates:
- A, E, L must fill positions 1,2,4,5 with the above constraints.
- Let's try:
  - Position 1: A
  - Position 2: E
  - Position 4: L
  - Position 5: ?
  - But we need 5 letters, and we have A, E, R, L. Missing one letter.
  - Wait, the word must be 5 letters and must contain A, E, R, L. So the missing letter must be one of the remaining letters not yet ruled out.

Actually, the word must contain A, E, R, L and one more letter (since it's 5 letters). Let's think differently.

We have:
- R at position 3
- Must contain A, E, L in the remaining positions 1,2,4,5 with the restrictions:
  - A not in 2 or 3 (3 is R, so A can be 1,4,5)
  - E not in 1 or 5 (so E can be 2 or 4)
  - L not in 4 (so L can be 1,2,5)

Possible combinations:
1. A in 1, E in 2, L in 5 → word: A E R _ L → need a letter for position 4. But we have A, E, R, L already, so position 4 must be one of these letters again? No, the word must be 5 letters with distinct letters (since we have 4 known letters and need one more). Wait, actually the word can have repeated letters, but we have no info about repeats yet.

But we have only 4 known letters (A, E, R, L) and need one more letter. Let's think of words with R in position 3 and containing A, E, L.

Possible words:
- A, E, R, L plus one more letter (not C, N, Y).
- Example: A, E, R, L, D → ""AERLD"" not a word.
- ""LEARN"" - but N is out.
- ""EARLY"" already tried.
- ""ARLER"" - not a valid word.
- ""ALERT"" - let's check:
  - A at 1 (allowed)
  - L at 2 (allowed)
  - E at 3 - but 3 is R, so invalid.
- ""ELAR"" - too short.
- ""LARGE"" - but G is new, let's check:
  - L A R G E
  - R at 3 ✓
  - A at 2 - but A cannot be at 2 (from EARLY feedback: A is - at 2). So invalid.
- ""REAL"" - too short.
- ""RELAX"" - but X is new, and A at 4 (allowed), E at 2 (allowed), L at 1 (allowed), R at 3 ✓, X new. So RELAX:
  - R E L A X
  - R at 3 ✓
  - E at 2 (allowed)
  - L at 1 (allowed)
  - A at 4 (allowed)
  - X is new letter, not yet ruled out.
  - Contains R, E, L, A and X.
  - Does not contain C, N, Y.
  - Seems valid.

Another candidate: ""TALER"" - but T is new, and:
  - T A L E R
  - R at 5, but must be at 3 - invalid.
- ""LATER"" - R at 4, invalid.
- ""ELATE"" - R missing - invalid.
- ""ARELA"" - R at 3 ✓, A at 1 (allowed), E at 2 (allowed), L at 4 (but L cannot be at 4 from EARLY feedback: L is - at 4). So invalid.
- ""ALERT"" - E at 2 (allowed), R at 3 ✓, L at 1 (allowed), A at 4 (allowed), T new. But E is at 2, which is allowed (E cannot be at 1 or 5). So ALERT seems valid:
  - A L E R T
  - R at 4 - but must be at 3 - invalid.

So the only valid candidate seems RELAX:
- R E L A X
- R at 3 ✓
- E at 2 (allowed)
- L at 1 (allowed)
- A at 4 (allowed)
- X new letter.

Therefore, the next guess is RELAX.
