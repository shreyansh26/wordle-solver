### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words in Wordle often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", etc.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which should help me quickly identify which vowels are in the word and their positions, as well as test the letters R and S.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know from the three guesses.

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
   – S is fixed in position 4.
   – A is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   – R, O, E are out.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(x) A(✓) N(-) T(x)
   – A is confirmed in position 3.
   – N is in the word but NOT in position 4.
   – P, L, T are out.

3. BASIN → B(x) A(-) S(-) I(x) N(-)
   – B and I are not in the word.
   – A is again marked “-” (wrong position), but we already know A must be in position 3, so this feedback confirms A is indeed in position 3.
   – S is marked “-” (wrong position), but we already know S is in position 4, so this is consistent.
   – N is marked “-” (wrong position), so N is not in position 5 either.
   – B and I are out.

Summary of constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ A S _
- Must contain N, and N cannot be in positions 4 or 5 → N must be in position 2.
- Excluded letters: R, O, E, P, L, T, B, I
- Still-allowed letters for positions 1 and 5: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but N is already used in position 2, S is already in position 4)

So the word must be: _ N A S _

Looking for valid 5-letter English words of the form ?NAS?:

- CAN??  → CAN??  → “CANS” is 4 letters.
- HNAS? → No common word.
- GNAS? → No common word.
- DNAS? → No common word.
- FNAS? → No common word.
- MNAS? → No common word.
- KNAS? → No common word.
- WNAS? → No common word.
- YNAS? → No common word.

Actually, the only common word that fits _ N A S _ is “NASAL”, but L is excluded.  
Next possibility: “GNASH” – but H is allowed, and G is allowed.  
Let’s check: G N A S H → G, N, A, S, H – none of the excluded letters appear.  
And N is in position 2 (allowed), A in 3 (fixed), S in 4 (fixed).

Therefore, “GNASH” is a valid next guess.
