### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which helps test many letters efficiently.

Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S), which helps test many letters efficiently. This should give good coverage for the first guess.\n\n<guess>arose</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on “arose”:\n\n- A(x) → A is not in the word.\n- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.\n- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.\n- S(x) → S is not in the word.\n- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.\n\nSo we know:\n- The word ends in E.\n- It contains R and O somewhere, but R is not in position 2 and O is not in position 3.\n- It does not contain A or S.\n\nNext, I want a word that:\n- Ends in E.\n- Uses R and O in different positions than before.\n- Avoids A and S.\n- Uses other common consonants to test more letters.\n\nA good candidate is “ROUTE”:\n- Ends in E.\n- R is now in position 1 (was 2, so new position).\n- O is now in position 2 (was 3, so new position).\n- Uses T and U to test new letters.\n\nThis should give us more information about R, O, T, and U.\n\n<guess>route</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: route -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two guesses we have:\n\n1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)\n   - E is fixed in position 5.\n   - R is in the word but not in position 2.\n   - O is in the word but not in position 3.\n   - A and S are not in the word.\n\n2. route → R(-) O(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)\n   - Confirms E is in position 5.\n   - R is in the word but not in position 1 (and also not 2 from before).\n   - O is in the word but not in position 2 (and also not 3 from before).\n   - U and T are not in the word.\n\nSo far we know:\n- Letters that must appear: R, O, E (with E fixed at position 5).\n- Letters that must not appear: A, S, U, T.\n- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2.\n- O cannot be in positions 2 or 3.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word ending in E that contains R and O in positions not yet ruled out.

From the three guesses we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed at position 5.
   - R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 1 (from arose and horde).
   - O is in the word but not in positions 3 or 2 (from arose and route).
   - A and S are not in the word.

2. route → R(-) O(-) U(x) T(x) E(✓)
   - R is not in position 1.
   - O is not in position 2.
   - U and T are not in the word.

3. horde → H(x) O(-) R(-) D(x) E(✓)
   - H and D are not in the word.
   - R is not in position 3 (from horde).
   - O is not in position 3 (already known from arose).

So far:
- Letters known to be in the word: R, O, E (with E fixed at position 5).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, S, U, T, H, D.
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → must be in position 4.
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 3 → must be in position 1 or 4.
  - But position 4 is taken by R, so O must be in position 1.

Therefore the pattern is:
O _ _ R E

We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters not yet ruled out. Available letters (common, not yet excluded): B, C, F, G, I, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting O _ _ R E:
- OMBER (but M, B are allowed)
- OPIRE (but I, P are allowed)
- ORIBE (but I, B are allowed)
- OXIRE (X is less common)
- OWIRE (W, I are allowed)

""OMBRE"" seems like a good choice as it uses common letters M and B which haven't been tested yet.
