### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T are NOT in the word (x).
- A and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains A and E.
2. A is not in position 3, and E is not in position 5.
3. We must avoid S, L, T entirely.

To maximize information, I want a word that:
- Uses A and E in different positions.
- Introduces other common consonants not yet tried (R, N, C, etc.).
- Avoids S, L, T.

A good candidate is ""CRANE"":
- C (new consonant)
- R (new consonant)
- A (known letter, new position 2)
- N (new consonant)
- E (known letter, new position 5)

This tests several new letters while placing A and E in positions we haven't tried yet.

Summary of what we know so far:

Letters NOT in the word:

Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions:
- A (not in position 2 or 3)
- E (not in position 4 or 5)
- C (somewhere, but not position 1)

So far we have:
- C somewhere (positions 2-5)
- A somewhere (positions 1, 4, 5)
- E somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3)

We need a word that:
1. Contains C, A, E (each in new positions)
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no S, L, T, R, N)
3. Uses common remaining consonants to maximize info (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y)

Let’s try ""CADET"":
- C (position 1 – new for C)
- A (position 2 – new for A)
- D (new consonant)
- E (position 4 – new for E)
- T (but T was already ruled out by SLATE feedback – can’t use T)

So ""CADET"" is invalid (contains T).

- A (position 2)
- C (position 3)

Next: ""CAGED"":

Let's consolidate everything we now know after three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (from all x’s):

- A (cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4)

- C (cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3)

So the possible positions for each known letter are:
- A: positions 1 or 5
- E: positions 1, 2, or 3
- C: positions 4 or 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains C, A, E exactly once each.
2. Places them only in the allowed positions above.
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Remaining common letters we haven’t tried: B, F, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T are NOT in the word (x).
- A and E are in the word but in the wrong positions (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains A and E.
2. A is not in position 3, and E is not in position 5.
3. We must avoid S, L, T entirely.

To maximize information, I want a word that:
- Uses A and E in different positions.
- Introduces other common consonants not yet tried (R, N, C, etc.).
- Avoids S, L, T.

A good candidate is ""CRANE"":
- C (new consonant)
- R (new consonant)
- A (known letter, new position 2)
- N (new consonant)
- E (known letter, new position 5)

This tests several new letters while placing A and E in positions we haven't tried yet.

Summary of what we know so far:

Letters NOT in the word:
- S, L, T, R, N

Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions:
- A (not in position 2 or 3)
- E (not in position 4 or 5)
- C (somewhere, but not position 1)

So far we have:
- C somewhere (positions 2-5)
- A somewhere (positions 1, 4, 5)
- E somewhere (positions 1, 2, 3)

We need a word that:
1. Contains C, A, E (each in new positions)
2. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no S, L, T, R, N)
3. Uses common remaining consonants to maximize info (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y)

Let’s try ""CADET"":
- C (position 1 – new for C)
- A (position 2 – new for A)
- D (new consonant)
- E (position 4 – new for E)
- T (but T was already ruled out by SLATE feedback – can’t use T)

So ""CADET"" is invalid (contains T).

Next candidate: ""CACHE"":
- C (position 1)
- A (position 2)
- C (position 3)
- H (new consonant)
- E (position 5 – but E was ruled out from position 5 by SLATE)

"" CACHE"" invalid (E in position 5).

Next: ""CAGED"":
- C (position 1)
- A (position 2)
- G (new consonant)
- E (position 4 – new for E)
- D (new consonant)

This fits all constraints:
- Contains C, A, E
- C in new position 1
- A in new position 2
- E in new position 4
- No S, L, T, R, N
- Adds G and D to test new letters

Let’s go with ""CAGED"".

From the feedback on EPICA:
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 1.
- P(x): P is NOT in the word.
- I(x): I is NOT in the word.
- C(✓): C is in position 4.
- A(✓): A is in position 5.

So we now know:
1. The word ends in CA (positions 4 and 5 are C and A).
2. E is somewhere in positions 2 or 3 (since it can't be 1, 4, or 5).
3. Forbidden letters so far: S, L, T, R, N, G, D, P, I.
4. Remaining common letters to try: B, F, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

We need a 5-letter word ending in CA, with E in position 2 or 3, and using only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- _ E _ C A
- _ _ E C A

Let's list valid words:
- ""BECA_"" – no 5-letter word.
- ""HECCA"" – no.
- ""MECCA"" – valid word.
- ""KECCA"" – no.
- ""FEXCA"" – no.
- ""VEXCA"" – no.
- ""WEXCA"" – no.
- ""YEXCA"" – no.

""MECCA"" fits:
- M (new letter)
- E (in position 2, allowed)
- C (position 4, correct)
- C (position 4, correct)
- A (position 5, correct)

But ""MECCA"" has two C's, and we already have C in position 4. This might not be valid since we don't know if C appears twice. However, ""MECCA"" is a valid 5-letter word ending in CA with E in position 2.

Another option: ""KECCA"" – invalid.
""FEXCA"" – invalid.
""HEXCA"" – invalid.

Another pattern: _ _ E C A
- ""BEXCA"" – invalid.
- ""FEXCA"" – invalid.
- ""WEXCA"" – invalid.

The only valid word seems to be ""MECCA"".

But let me double-check:
- ""MECCA"" uses M, E, C, C, A.
- C is already known to be in position 4, so having another C is possible.
- All letters are allowed.

Therefore, ""MECCA"" is the best next guess.
