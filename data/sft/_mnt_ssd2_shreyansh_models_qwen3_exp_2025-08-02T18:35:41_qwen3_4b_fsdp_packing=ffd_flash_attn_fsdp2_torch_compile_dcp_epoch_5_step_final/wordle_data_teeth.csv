### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word, and the feedback will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word, and the feedback will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

- Letters in the word but in wrong positions: E (cannot be in position 4 or 5), T (cannot be in position 3)

So the word must contain:
- E (positions 1, 2, or 3)
- T (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y

I need a word that:
1. Uses E and T in allowed positions
2. Uses other allowed letters
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word

Let's try ""THEME"":
- T in position 1 (allowed)
- H (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- M (allowed)
- E in position 5 (allowed, since E can't be in 4 or 5? Wait, feedback says E is in word but wrong position in both guesses. In arose, E was in position 5 and marked wrong position. In untie, E was in position 4 and marked wrong position. So E cannot be in positions 4 or 5. So position 5 is invalid for E. So THEME has E in 5 which is invalid.

Next try: ""TWEED"":
- T in position 1 (allowed)
- W (allowed)
- E in position 3 (allowed)
- E in position 4 (invalid, E can't be in 4)
So invalid.

Next try: ""BETEL"":
- B (allowed)

- T in position 3 (invalid, T can't be in 3)
So invalid.

Next try: ""FETAL"":

So invalid.

Next try: ""METAL"":
- M (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)

So invalid.

Next try: ""PETAL"":

- E in position 2 (allowed)
- T in position 3 (invalid)
So invalid.

Next try: ""VETED"":
- V (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- T in position 3 (invalid)
So invalid.

Next try: ""WETTE"":
- W (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- T in position 3 (invalid)
So invalid.

Next try: ""YETTE"":
- Y (allowed)
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- T in position 3 (invalid)
So invalid.

Next try: ""ETTLE"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- T in position 2 (allowed)
- T in position 3 (invalid)
So invalid.

Next try: ""ELITE"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- L (allowed)
- I (invalid, I is out)
So invalid.

Next try: ""ELDER"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- L (allowed)
- D (allowed)
- E in position 4 (invalid)
So invalid.

Next try: ""ELBOW"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- L (allowed)
- B (allowed)
- O (invalid, O is out)
So invalid.

Next try: ""ELDER"" already tried.

Next try: ""ELUDE"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- L (allowed)
- U (invalid, U is out)
So invalid.

Next try: ""ELITE"" already tried.

Next try: ""ELOPE"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- L (allowed)
- O (invalid, O is out)
So invalid.

Next try: ""ETUDE"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- T in position 2 (allowed)
- U (invalid, U is out)
So invalid.

Next try: ""ETHYL"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- T in position 2 (allowed)
- H (allowed)
- Y (allowed)
- L (allowed)
This uses E and T in allowed positions and only allowed letters.

This seems valid.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word, and the feedback will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains E, but not in position 5.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes E (but not in position 5).
2. Excludes A, R, O, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good vowels: I, U (since A, O are out).

Let me try ""UNTIE"":
- Uses E (position 4, not 5).
- Uses common letters U, N, T, I.
- Doesn't use A, R, O, S.

This should give good information about U, N, T, I, and confirm where E can go.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This gives me a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word, and the feedback will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O, S are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains E, but not in position 5.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes E (but not in position 5).
2. Excludes A, R, O, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.
Good vowels: I, U (since A, O are out).

Let me try ""UNTIE"":
- Uses E (position 4, not 5).
- Uses common letters U, N, T, I.
- Doesn't use A, R, O, S.

This should give good information about U, N, T, I, and confirm where E can go.

Current constraints:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, I
- Letters in the word but in wrong positions: E (cannot be in position 4 or 5), T (cannot be in position 3)

So the word must contain:

- T (positions 1, 2, 4, or 5)

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y

I need a word that:
1. Uses E and T in allowed positions
2. Uses other allowed letters
3. Is a valid 5-letter English word

Let's try ""THEME"":
- T in position 1 (allowed)
- H (allowed)

Next try: ""ELDER"" already tried.

Next try: ""ELUDE"":

This uses E and T in allowed positions and only allowed letters.

This seems valid.

From the feedback so far:

Letters NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, I, Y, L  
Letters known to be in the word but in wrong positions:  
- E (cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5)  
- T (cannot be in positions 2 or 3)  
- H (cannot be in position 3)  

So E must be in position 2 or 3.  
T must be in position 1, 4, or 5.  
H must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, K, M, P, V, W, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Contains E, T, H in allowed positions  
- Uses only the remaining allowed letters

Let’s try to place:
- E in position 2  
- T in position 4  
- H in position 1  

That gives: H _ E T _

We need two more letters from the remaining pool.  
Let’s pick common ones like D and K: H D E T K → “HDETK” (not a word).  
Try “THEME” but E in 5 is invalid.  
Try “ETHIC” – C is allowed, but I is invalid.  
Try “ETHED” – D is allowed, but E in 4 is invalid.  
Try “ETHOS” – S is invalid.  
Try “ETHYL” already used.  
Try “ETHED” invalid.  
Try “ETHIC” invalid.  
Try “ETHOS” invalid.  
Try “ETHED” invalid.  
Try “ETHED” invalid.

Let’s try E in position 3:

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

Letters NOT in the word (x feedback):
A, R, O, S, U, N, I, Y, L, F, M

Letters confirmed in the word and their exact positions:
1st letter: T (✓)
3rd letter: E (✓)

Letters known to be in the word but in the wrong positions:
H (cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5)  
T (cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5; position 1 is already T, so the second T must be in position 4)

So the pattern so far is:
T _ E T _

The only remaining letter to determine is position 2 and position 5.  
From the allowed letters (those never marked x):  
B, C, D, G, K, P, V, W, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits T _ E T _ and uses only these letters.

Possible candidates:
- TWEET – W is allowed, but “W” and “W” are fine.  
- TKEET – not a valid word.  
- TPEET – not a valid word.  
- TDEET – not a valid word.  
- TBEET – not a valid word.  
- TGEET – not a valid word.  
- TVEET – not a valid word.  
- TKEET – not a valid word.  
- TZEET – not a valid word.  

The only common English word that fits is “TWEET”.

Check:
1: T ✓  
2: W (allowed)  
3: E ✓  
4: T ✓ (second T)  
5: T (allowed, since T only had restrictions on positions 2,3,5 before; now only position 1 and 4 are fixed)

No conflicts.
