### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use several of these letters without repeating any. 

After considering various options, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, S are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

Since A, R, O, S are ruled out, we need a word that:
1. Contains the letter E (but not in the 5th position).
2. Uses none of A, R, O, S.
3. Uses common remaining letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (E is already known).

A balanced choice is ""UNTIE"":
- U and I are new common vowels.
- N and T are common consonants.
- E is reused in the 2nd position (since it can’t be 5th).

This gives us 4 new letters (U, N, T, I) plus the known E, while respecting all constraints.

- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, S, U, N  
- Remaining common letters to try: L, C, D, P, B, G, H, M, etc.

- Keep T and I fixed in positions 3 and 4.

Let's parse the new feedback on ELITE:

E(-)  → E is in the word but NOT in position 1  
L(x)  → L is NOT in the word  
I(-)  → I is in the word but NOT in position 3  
T(-)  → T is in the word but NOT in position 4  
E(-)  → E is in the word but NOT in position 5  

Combining with prior feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   Ruled out: A, R, O, S  
   E is somewhere in the word (positions 2, 3, or 4 are still open).

2. untie → U(x) N(x) T(✓) I(✓) E(-)  
   Ruled out: U, N  
   T is fixed in position 3  
   I is fixed in position 4  
   E is in the word but not in position 5.

3. elite → E(-) L(x) I(-) T(-) E(-)  
   Adds: L is NOT in the word  
   I is in the word but not in position 3 (already fixed in position 4)  
   T is in the word but not in position 4 (already fixed in position 3)  
   E is in the word but not in positions 1 or 5 (so E must be in position 2)

So now we know the exact pattern:
- Position 1: not E, not any of A, R, O, S, U, N, L  
- Position 2: E  
- Position 3: T  
- Position 4: I  
- Position 5: not E, not any of A, R, O, S, U, N, L  

Letters still allowed for position 1 and 5: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we want common letters).

Common consonants left: B, C, D, M, P, G, H, K

We need a 5-letter word with pattern: _ E T I _

Possible candidates: BETIC (not a word), DETIC (not a word), METIC (not a word), PETIT (but P is position 1, E is 2, T is 3, I is 4, T is 5 - but T is already in position 3 and we don't know if T can repeat), etc.

Looking at common words: ""PETIT"" is valid (French loanword, but accepted in English dictionaries), ""METIC"" is not, ""GETIT"" is not, ""BETIT"" is not.

Another candidate: ""WETIK"" is not a word. ""FETID"" is a word but pattern is F E T I D - but T is in position 3 and I is in position 4, so F E T I D would fit _ E T I _ pattern. Let's check: F is allowed (not ruled out), E is in position 2 (correct), T in 3 (correct), I in 4 (correct), D in 5 (allowed).

""FETID"" seems valid and fits all constraints.
