2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", etc.

Looking at these options, ""CRANE"" is particularly good because it contains:
- C: Very common consonant
- R: Common consonant
- A: Most common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel

This combination should give good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C (x) – not in the word at all.
- R (-) – in the word but not in position 2.
- A (x) – not in the word.
- N (x) – not in the word.
- E (-) – in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: C, A, N.
- Letters definitely present: R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R and E.
- Does not contain C, A, N.
- R cannot be in position 2.
- E cannot be in position 5.

Good candidate letters to include: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, etc.

A word that satisfies these constraints is ""STORE"":
- S, T, O are new letters to test.
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since it can't be in position 2).
- E is in position 4 (allowed, since it can't be in position 5).

Let's check:
- Letters: S, T, O, R, E – none of C, A, N.
- R not in position 2 – correct (it's in 3).
- E not in position 5 – correct (it's in 4).

This seems like a strong second guess.

Let’s update what we know after the two guesses.

From CRANE:
- C, A, N are NOT in the word.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 2.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

From STORE:
- S is in the word AND in position 1 (✓).
- T, O are NOT in the word.
- R is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (we already knew that).

So far:
- Letters definitely absent: C, A, N, T, O.
- Letters definitely present: S (position 1), R, E.
- R cannot be in positions 2 or 4.
- E cannot be in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S.
2. Contains R and E somewhere.
3. Does NOT contain C, A, N, T, O.
4. R must be in position 3 or 5 (since 2 and 4 are excluded).
5. E must be in position 2, 3, or 4 (since 5 is excluded).

Let’s list possible positions:
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 2: could be E or another allowed letter
- Position 3: could be R or E
- Position 4: could be E or another allowed letter
- Position 5: could be R or another allowed letter (but E can’t be here)

Possible patterns:
- S _ R E _  (R in 3, E in 4)
- S E _ R _  (E in 2, R in 4 – but R can’t be in 4, so invalid)
- S _ _ E R  (R in 5, E in 4)
- S E R _ _  (E in 2, R in 3)
- S _ E R _  (E in 3, R in 4 – but R can’t be in 4, so invalid)
- S E _ _ R  (E in 2, R in 5)

Let’s think of words that fit:
- S E R _ _ : “SERUM” – but U is allowed, M is allowed, but we don’t know about U or M yet. However, we need to check if all letters are allowed. SERUM has S, E, R, U, M – none of the forbidden letters (C,A,N,T,O). Also, positions: R is in 3 (allowed), E is in 2 (allowed). This looks valid.
- S _ _ E R : “SHERB” – but B is allowed, H is allowed, but “SHERB” isn’t a common word.
- S _ R E _ : “SPARE” – but A is forbidden.
- S E _ _ R : “SEWER” – but W is allowed, E is in 2 (allowed), R is in 5 (allowed). Letters: S,E,W,E,R – but double E is possible, and W is allowed. However, “SEWER” has E in 4, which is allowed, and R in 5, which is allowed. But we already have E in the word, and “SEWER” would have two E’s – possible, but let’s see if there’s a better choice.
- S _ E R _ : “SOPER” – but O is forbidden.
- S E R _ _ : “SERUM” seems the best fit.

“SERUM” fits all constraints:
- Starts with S (position 1).
- Contains R (position 3) and E (position 2).
- No forbidden letters (C,A,N,T,O).
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since it can’t be in 2 or 4).
- E is in position 2 (allowed, since it can’t be in 5).

Therefore, “SERUM” is a good next guess.
