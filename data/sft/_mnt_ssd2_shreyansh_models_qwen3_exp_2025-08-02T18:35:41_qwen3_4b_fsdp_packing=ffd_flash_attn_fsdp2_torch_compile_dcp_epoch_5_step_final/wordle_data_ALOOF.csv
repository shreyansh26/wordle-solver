### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), which should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- O is in the correct third position (✓)
- R, S, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the pattern so far is:
A _ O _ _

Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, S, E

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with A
2. Has O in the third position
3. Does NOT contain R, S, or E
4. Uses only the remaining alphabet letters

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for common words that fit A _ O _ _:
- ABOIL (but contains I and L, and B - but B is allowed)
- ADORE (but contains R and E - both excluded)
- AGOUI (but contains U and I, and G - but G is allowed)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S), which should give me good information about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the correct first position (✓)
- O is in the correct third position (✓)
- R, S, E are not in the word at all (x)

So the pattern so far is:
A _ O _ _

Letters we know are NOT in the word: R, S, E

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with A
2. Has O in the third position
3. Does NOT contain R, S, or E
4. Uses only the remaining alphabet letters

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Looking for common words that fit A _ O _ _:
- ABOIL (but contains I and L, and B - but B is allowed)
- ADORE (but contains R and E - both excluded)
- AGOUI (but contains U and I, and G - but G is allowed)
- AMONG (contains M, O, N, G - but O is already in position 3)
- AFOUL (contains F, U, L - all allowed)
- ADOPT (contains D, O, P, T - but O is already in position 3)
- AFOOT (contains F, O, O, T - but O is already in position 3)
- ALOOF (contains L, O, O, F - but O is already in position 3)
- ADOUB (but contains D, O, U, B - but O is already in position 3)
- ADOPT (contains D, O, P, T - but O is already in position 3)
- AFOUL (contains F, O, U, L - but O is already in position 3)
- ADOUB (contains D, O, U, B - but O is already in position 3)
- ADOPT (contains D, O, P, T - but O is already in position 3)

Looking at these, ""among"" seems like a good candidate because:
- Starts with A
- Has O in the third position
- Uses M, N, G (all allowed)
- Common word

Let me check: A M O N G - yes, this fits all constraints.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters that are in the correct positions:
   - A is first (✓)
   - O is third (✓)

2. Letters that are **not** in the word at all:
   - R, S, E, M, N, G

So the pattern is: A _ O _ _  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a common 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A
- Has O in the 3rd spot
- Uses only the allowed letters

Let’s list possibilities quickly:

A B O _ _  → ABOIL, ABOFT, ABORE (but E is out), ABOYS (but S is out)  
A C O _ _  → ACORN (R out), ACUTE, ACORN (R out)  
A D O _ _  → ADORE (E out), ADOPT (P/T allowed), ADOUB (B allowed)  
A F O _ _  → AFOOT (T allowed), AFOUL  
A H O _ _  → AHOLD, AHOY  
A I O _ _  → AIOU? (not a word)  
A L O _ _  → ALOOF, ALOIN  
A P O _ _  → APOCAL (but 6 letters), APODS (S out)  
A T O _ _  → ATOLL, ATONIC (but 6 letters), ATONE (E out)  
A V O _ _  → AVOWS (S out), AVOCADO (too long)  
A W O _ _  → AWAKE (E out), AWOL (too short)  
A Y O _ _  → AYORK (but Y is 2nd)  

The most promising common words left are:
- AFOUL (A-F-O-U-L) – uses F, U, L (all allowed)  
- ALOOF (A-L-O-O-F) – but has two O’s, and we only know one O is confirmed in position 3  
- ADOPT (A-D-O-P-T) – uses D, P, T (all allowed)  

Among these, “AFOUL” feels most common and uses three new letters that haven’t been tested yet. Let’s go with it.

2. Letters that are in the word but in the wrong position:
   - F (currently in position 2, so it must be in position 4 or 5)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word:

So the pattern so far is: A _ O _ _

Possible positions for F and L:
- F can be in position 4 or 5
- L can be in position 2 or 4

Let’s list the remaining allowed letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, H, I, J, K, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a word that:
- Starts with A
- Has O in position 3
- Contains both F and L in the remaining slots (positions 2, 4, 5)
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible combinations:

Check:

- However, we know F must be in the word, so position 4 is good for F.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

From all feedback so far:

1. Fixed letters:
   - Position 1: A (✓)
   - Position 2: L (✓)
   - Position 3: O (✓)

2. Letters that are in the word but in the wrong position:
   - F (currently in position 4, so it must be in position 5)

3. Letters that are NOT in the word:
   - R, S, E, M, N, G, U, T

So the pattern is now: A L O _ _  
We know F must be in position 5, so the last letter is F.

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with ""ALO"" and ends with F. The only common word that fits is ""ALOOF"", but we already ruled out O in position 4 because we know O is only in position 3. 

Wait, let me re-examine: the pattern is A L O _ _ and the last letter must be F. The only possible word is ""ALOOF"" but that would have two O's, which contradicts our feedback showing only one O in position 3. 

Actually, the correct word must be ""ALOOF"" but since O is already fixed in position 3, the fourth letter can't be O. This suggests I need to check if there's another word. 

Looking at valid 5-letter words starting with ""ALO"" and ending with F: ""ALOOF"" is the only one, but it has two O's. This implies the word must be ""ALOOF"" despite the double O, because that's the only possibility. 

However, the feedback shows O is only in position 3, so ""ALOOF"" would have O in positions 3 and 4, which contradicts. This means my earlier assumption might be off. 

Wait, let me re-express: the pattern is A L O _ _ and we know F must be in position 5. The only valid word is ""ALOOF"" but that has O in position 4, which is allowed because the feedback only shows O is in position 3, not ruling out other O's. 

But the feedback from guess 3 (afoul) showed O(✓) in position 3, but doesn't say anything about other O's. So ""ALOOF"" is possible. 

However, ""ALOOF"" has two O's, which might not be intended. Let me think if there's another word. 

Actually, the correct word is ""ALOOF"" because it's the only valid word fitting A L O _ F. Even though it has two O's, the feedback only confirms O in position 3, not excluding other O's. 

But looking back, the feedback from guess 1 (arose) showed O(✓) in position 3, which means O is in position 3 but doesn't preclude other O's. So ""ALOOF"" is acceptable. 

However, ""ALOOF"" has O in position 4, which is allowed. 

Therefore, the word must be ""ALOOF"".

But wait, let me verify: the pattern is A L O _ _ and the last letter is F. The only valid word is ""ALOOF"". 

Yes, ""ALOOF"" is the correct word.
