### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting several letters in the secret word right away.

We still need to test common consonants and the remaining vowels (U).

A good next guess should:

- Avoid any already ruled-out letters.

Good candidates use letters like T, N, L, I, C, etc. A strong choice is ""POINT"":\n- P: new letter\n- O: moves to position 2 (was in 3, now in 2)\n- I: new vowel\n- N: common consonant\n- T: common consonant\n- Ends with E (already known)\n\nThis tests new letters while respecting the constraints.\n\n<guess>point</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two rounds of feedback we have:\n\n1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)\n   - E is fixed in position 5.\n   - O is in the word but not in position 3.\n\n2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)\n   - O is now confirmed in position 2.\n   - Letters P, I, N, T are not in the word.\n   - Letters already ruled out so far: A, R, S, P, I, N, T.\n\nCurrent known pattern:\n- Position 2 = O\n- Position 5 = E\n\nRemaining letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\nWe still need to test common consonants and the remaining vowels (U).\n\nA good next guess should:\n- Keep O in position 2 and E in position 5.\n- Introduce new common consonants not yet tested (e.g., L, C, D, G, M, B, etc.).\n- Avoid any already ruled-out letters.\n\nLet’s try “COBWE” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Let's update what we now know after three guesses:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)  
   – E is fixed at position 5.  
   – O is in the word but **not** at position 3.

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   – O is fixed at position 2.  
   – P, I, N, T are out.

3. clove → C(x) L(-) O(-) V(x) E(✓)  
   – E is still at position 5.  
   – C and V are out.  
   – L is in the word but **not** at position 3.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ E  
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, P, I, N, T, C, V  
- Letters we know are in the word: O (at position 2), L (somewhere else), E (at position 5)  
- Still unused common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, Y, etc.  
- Still unused vowels: U (since A, I, O, E are partially known).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2 and E in position 5.  
- Contains L somewhere (but not at position 3).  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible positions for L: 1, 4  
Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4: from the remaining pool.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- L at position 1: L O _ _ E  
  – Need two more letters for positions 3 and 4, chosen from the remaining pool.  
  – Common choices: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, Y, U.

Try “LODGE”:
- L O D G E  
  – L at 1 (allowed), O at 2, D and G are new, E at 5.  
  – Letters used: L, O, D, G, E — none are ruled out.  
  – “LODGE” is a valid English word.

This seems like a good next guess.

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)

   – O is in the word but **not** at position 3.

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   – O is fixed at position 2.  
   – P, I, N, T are out.

3. clove → C(x) L(-) O(-) V(x) E(✓)  
   – E is still at position 5.  
   – C and V are out.  
   – L is in the word but **not** at position 3.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ E  
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, P, I, N, T, C, V  
- Letters we know are in the word: O (at position 2), L (somewhere else), E (at position 5)  
- Still unused common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, Y, etc.  
- Still unused vowels: U (since A, I, O, E are partially known).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2 and E in position 5.  
- Contains L somewhere (but not at position 3).  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible positions for L: 1, 4  
Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4: from the remaining pool.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- L at position 1: L O _ _ E  
  – Need two more letters for positions 3 and 4, chosen from the remaining pool.  
  – Common choices: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, Y, U.

Try “LODGE”:
- L O D G E  
  – L at 1 (allowed), O at 2, D and G are new, E at 5.  
  – Letters used: L, O, D, G, E — none are ruled out.  
  – “LODGE” is a valid English word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting several letters in the secret word right away.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A (x) – not in the word
- R (x) – not in the word
- O (-) – in the word but wrong position
- S (x) – not in the word
- E (✓) – in the word and in the correct (last) position

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains O somewhere, but not in position 3.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

Next step: pick a word that keeps E in position 5, moves O to a different spot, and introduces new common letters not yet tested. Good candidates use letters like T, N, L, I, C, etc. A strong choice is ""POINT"":
- P: new letter
- O: moves to position 2 (was in 3, now in 2)
- I: new vowel
- N: common consonant
- T: common consonant
- Ends with E (already known)

This tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   - O is now confirmed in position 2.
   - Letters P, I, N, T are not in the word.
   - Letters already ruled out so far: A, R, S, P, I, N, T.

Current known pattern:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 5 = E

Remaining letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
We still need to test common consonants and the remaining vowels (U).

A good next guess should:
- Keep O in position 2 and E in position 5.
- Introduce new common consonants not yet tested (e.g., L, C, D, G, M, B, etc.).
- Avoid any already ruled-out letters.

Let’s try “COBWE” – but that’s not a valid English word. Instead, let’s pick a valid word that fits the pattern and tests new letters.

“COBWE” is invalid, so let’s try “COBEE” – also invalid. Instead, let’s try “CLOVE”:
- C: new letter
- L: new letter
- O: already known in position 2
- V: new letter
- E: already known in position 5

“CLOVE” is a valid English word and fits the pattern:
- C _ O _ E
- Tests C, L, V which haven’t been tried yet.

Let’s go with CLOVE.

   – The third letter is **not** O (because the third O in position 3 got “-”).

So the pattern is now completely determined:

L O _ G E

We just need to pick a valid 5-letter English word that fits L O _ G E.

Looking at common letters for position 3 (not O), the only common consonants left that fit are D, F, H, M, Y, etc. The word “LODGE” already appeared in guess 4 (but that was “looge” which is a typo; the correct spelling is “LODGE”). Since “LODGE” is valid and fits the pattern, we can safely guess it now.

However, to avoid the typo, let’s double-check: the correct spelling is “LODGE”, and it fits L O D G E. Since we have not yet tested D, and it is allowed, we can go with “LODGE”.

But wait, in guess 4 we wrote “looge” (which is a typo for “loose” or “loved” but actually the correct word is “LODGE”). To avoid confusion, let’s just directly use the confirmed pattern.

The pattern is L O _ G E, and the only common letter left is D, giving LODGE.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting several letters in the secret word right away.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A (x) – not in the word
- R (x) – not in the word
- O (-) – in the word but wrong position
- S (x) – not in the word
- E (✓) – in the word and in the correct (last) position

So we know:
1. The word ends with E.
2. It contains O somewhere, but not in position 3.
3. It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

Next step: pick a word that keeps E in position 5, moves O to a different spot, and introduces new common letters not yet tested. Good candidates use letters like T, N, L, I, C, etc. A strong choice is ""POINT"":
- P: new letter
- O: moves to position 2 (was in 3, now in 2)
- I: new vowel
- N: common consonant
- T: common consonant
- Ends with E (already known)

This tests new letters while respecting the constraints.

Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
   - O is now confirmed in position 2.
   - Letters P, I, N, T are not in the word.
   - Letters already ruled out so far: A, R, S, P, I, N, T.

Current known pattern:
- Position 2 = O
- Position 5 = E

Remaining letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
We still need to test common consonants and the remaining vowels (U).

A good next guess should:
- Keep O in position 2 and E in position 5.
- Introduce new common consonants not yet tested (e.g., L, C, D, G, M, B, etc.).
- Avoid any already ruled-out letters.

Let’s try “COBWE” – but that’s not a valid English word. Instead, let’s pick a valid word that fits the pattern and tests new letters.

“COBWE” is invalid, so let’s try “COBEE” – also invalid. Instead, let’s try “CLOVE”:
- C: new letter
- L: new letter
- O: already known in position 2
- V: new letter
- E: already known in position 5

“CLOVE” is a valid English word and fits the pattern:
- C _ O _ E
- Tests C, L, V which haven’t been tried yet.

Let’s go with CLOVE.

Let's update what we now know after three guesses:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)  
   – E is fixed at position 5.  
   – O is in the word but **not** at position 3.

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   – O is fixed at position 2.  
   – P, I, N, T are out.

3. clove → C(x) L(-) O(-) V(x) E(✓)  
   – E is still at position 5.  
   – C and V are out.  
   – L is in the word but **not** at position 3.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ E  
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, S, P, I, N, T, C, V  
- Letters we know are in the word: O (at position 2), L (somewhere else), E (at position 5)  
- Still unused common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, Y, etc.  
- Still unused vowels: U (since A, I, O, E are partially known).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2 and E in position 5.  
- Contains L somewhere (but not at position 3).  
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible positions for L: 1, 4  
Possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4: from the remaining pool.

Let’s try to construct a word:
- L at position 1: L O _ _ E  
  – Need two more letters for positions 3 and 4, chosen from the remaining pool.  
  – Common choices: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, Y, U.

Try “LODGE”:
- L O D G E  
  – L at 1 (allowed), O at 2, D and G are new, E at 5.  
  – Letters used: L, O, D, G, E — none are ruled out.  
  – “LODGE” is a valid English word.

This seems like a good next guess.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after four guesses.

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)  
   – E is fixed at position 5.  
   – O is in the word but **not** at position 3.

2. point → P(x) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)  
   – O is fixed at position 2.  
   – P, I, N, T are out.

3. clove → C(x) L(-) O(-) V(x) E(✓)  
   – C, V are out.  
   – L is in the word but **not** at position 3.

4. looge → L(✓) O(✓) O(-) G(✓) E(✓)  
   – L is fixed at position 1.  
   – O is fixed at position 2.  
   – G is fixed at position 4.  
   – E is fixed at position 5.  
   – The third letter is **not** O (because the third O in position 3 got “-”).

So the pattern is now completely determined:

L O _ G E

We just need to pick a valid 5-letter English word that fits L O _ G E.

Looking at common letters for position 3 (not O), the only common consonants left that fit are D, F, H, M, Y, etc. The word “LODGE” already appeared in guess 4 (but that was “looge” which is a typo; the correct spelling is “LODGE”). Since “LODGE” is valid and fits the pattern, we can safely guess it now.

However, to avoid the typo, let’s double-check: the correct spelling is “LODGE”, and it fits L O D G E. Since we have not yet tested D, and it is allowed, we can go with “LODGE”.

But wait, in guess 4 we wrote “looge” (which is a typo for “loose” or “loved” but actually the correct word is “LODGE”). To avoid confusion, let’s just directly use the confirmed pattern.

The pattern is L O _ G E, and the only common letter left is D, giving LODGE.

So the next and final guess is LODGE.
