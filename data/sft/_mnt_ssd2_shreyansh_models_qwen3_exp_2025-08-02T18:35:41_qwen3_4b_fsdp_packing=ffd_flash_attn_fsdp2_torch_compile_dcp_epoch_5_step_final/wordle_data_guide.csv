### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common starting letter)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present and their possible positions.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O, S are **not** in the word at all (x).
- E is **correct and in the right place** (✓).

That tells us:
1. The word ends with E.
2. The letters A, R, O, S are excluded entirely.
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

A good second guess should:
- Keep the known E in position 5.
- Avoid A, R, O, S.
- Introduce new, common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Looking at remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, etc.

A balanced word that fits is “UNTIE”:
- U, N, T, I are new letters.
- Ends with the confirmed E.

This will help test several fresh letters while respecting the constraints.

   - N and T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains U and I somewhere (but not in positions 1 and 4).
- Excludes: A, R, O, S, N, T.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Has U and I in positions other than 1 and 4.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try “DULCE”:
- D, L, C are new letters.
- U is in position 2 (allowed, since it’s not in position 1).
- I is in position 3 (allowed, since it’s not in position 4).
- Ends with E (correct).
- Uses only allowed letters.

This seems like a good third guess to narrow down possibilities.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. One such word is ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- A (very common starting letter)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O, S are **not** in the word at all (x).
- E is **correct and in the right place** (✓).

That tells us:
1. The word ends with E.
2. The letters A, R, O, S are excluded entirely.
3. We still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

A good second guess should:
- Keep the known E in position 5.
- Avoid A, R, O, S.
- Introduce new, common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Looking at remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, etc.

A balanced word that fits is “UNTIE”:
- U, N, T, I are new letters.
- Ends with the confirmed E.

This will help test several fresh letters while respecting the constraints.

From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   - E is fixed in position 5.

2. untie → U(-) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓)  
   - U and I are in the word but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.  
   - N and T are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains U and I somewhere (but not in positions 1 and 4).
- Excludes: A, R, O, S, N, T.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E.
- Has U and I in positions other than 1 and 4.
- Uses only allowed letters.

Let’s try “DULCE”:
- D, L, C are new letters.
- U is in position 2 (allowed, since it’s not in position 1).
- I is in position 3 (allowed, since it’s not in position 4).
- Ends with E (correct).
- Uses only allowed letters.

This seems like a good third guess to narrow down possibilities.

From the new feedback on FUDGE:

- F(x) → F is NOT in the word.

- D(-) → D is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- G(-) → G is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- E(✓) → E is confirmed in position 5.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ U _ _ E
- Must contain: D (not in position 3), G (not in position 4)
- Must NOT contain: A, R, O, S, N, T, L, C, F

Remaining common letters: B, H, I, J, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible positions for D and G:
- D could be in position 1, 4
- G could be in position 1, 2, 3 (but 2 is U), so 1 or 3

But G cannot be in position 4 (from FUDGE feedback), and D cannot be in position 3.

Let’s consider possible placements:

1. If D is in position 1: D U _ _ E
   - Then G must be in position 3: D U G _ E
   - Need a valid letter for position 4 (cannot be any excluded letters)
   - Possible letters: B, H, I, K, M, P, V, W, Y
   - Example: DUDGE (but D is repeated, not sure), DUGIE (invalid), DUGME (invalid)
   - Doesn’t seem promising.

2. If D is in position 4: _ U _ D E
   - Then G must be in position 1 or 3
   - If G is in position 1: G U _ D E
     - Need a valid letter for position 3 (not excluded)
     - Example: GUMDE (invalid), GUIDE (but I is allowed)
   - If G is in position 3: _ U G D E
     - Need a valid letter for position 1
     - Example: BUGDE (invalid), HUGDE (invalid), PUGDE (invalid)

3. If D is in position 1 and G in position 3: D U G _ E
   - Need a valid letter for position 4
   - Possible: DUGIE (invalid), DUGME (invalid), DUGBE (invalid)
   - Doesn’t seem to form valid words.

4. If G is in position 1 and D in position 4: G U _ D E
   - Need a valid letter for position 3
   - Example: GUINE (but N is excluded), GUILD (but L is excluded), GUILE (but L is excluded)
   - Doesn’t seem valid.

5. If G is in position 3 and D in position 4: _ U G D E
   - Need a valid letter for position 1
   - Example: BUGDE (invalid), HUGDE (invalid), PUGDE (invalid)

6. If we consider other letters for positions not yet filled:
   - Maybe D is in position 1 and G in position 3, but position 4 must be a valid letter
   - Example: D U G I E (but I is allowed, E is already in position 5, so DUGIE is invalid as it’s 5 letters ending with E)
   - Actually, DUGIE is 5 letters: D U G I E, but E is already in position 5, so this would be D U G I E, but we know E is only in position 5, so this is invalid.

Wait, let’s think differently. The pattern is _ U _ _ E, with D and G somewhere in positions 1,3,4 (D not in 3, G not in 4).

Possible valid words:
- If D is in position 1: D U _ _ E
  - Need G in position 3 or 4 (but G cannot be in 4), so G in 3: D U G _ E
  - Position 4 must be a valid letter (not excluded)
  - Possible: DUGIE (invalid), DUGME (invalid), DUGBE (invalid)
  - Doesn’t seem valid.

- If D is in position 4: _ U _ D E
  - G must be in position 1 or 3
  - If G in 1: G U _ D E
    - Position 3 must be valid: GUMDE (invalid), GUILE (invalid), GUILD (invalid)
  - If G in 3: _ U G D E
    - Position 1 must be valid: BUGDE (invalid), HUGDE (invalid), PUGDE (invalid)

- If we consider other letters:
  - Maybe the word uses I in position 3 or 4
  - From untie feedback, I is in the word but not in position 4
  - So I could be in position 3: _ U I _ E
  - Then we need D and G somewhere
  - Pattern: _ U I _ E with D and G in positions 1 or 4
  - But G cannot be in position 4 (from FUDGE feedback), so G must be in position 1: G U I _ E
  - Position 4 must be D (since D must be in word): G U I D E
  - ""GUIDE"" is a valid word and fits all constraints:
    - G in position 1 (allowed, not excluded)
    - U in position 2 (confirmed)
    - I in position 3 (allowed, not excluded)
    - D in position 4 (allowed, not excluded)
