For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that can help eliminate or confirm many letters early.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels quickly.
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S).
3. All letters are among the most frequent in English.
4. It has no repeated letters, maximizing information gain.

This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities for the secret word.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong spots): A, E
- Positions to avoid for A: 1
- Positions to avoid for E: 5

Next, I want a word that:
1. Contains both A and E (since they’re confirmed present).
2. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
3. Places E somewhere other than position 5.
4. Avoids R, O, S entirely.
5. Uses other common letters to maximize new information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, G, B, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (but A and E are already confirmed).

A balanced word that satisfies these constraints is “TABLE”:
- Contains A (position 2) and E (position 5) – but wait, E is in position 5 which is invalid (feedback says E is not in position 5). So TABLE is invalid.

Next option: “ELATE” – but E in position 1 is allowed, A in position 2 is allowed, E in position 3 is allowed, but we already know E is in the word (but not in position 5). However, ELATE has two E’s – but we don’t know if E is duplicated. To avoid assuming duplicates, let’s pick a word with distinct letters.

Better choice: “TAPED” – but it has E in position 4 (allowed) and A in position 2 (allowed), and avoids R, O, S. However, “TAPED” uses P and D which are less common. Let’s prefer more common letters.

Another option: “LATER” – but R is invalid. “PLAID” – but D is less common.

Let’s try “BEACH”:
- B, E, A, C, H
- E is in position 2 (allowed)
- A is in position 3 (allowed)
- Avoids R, O, S
- Uses common letters B, C, H

Let’s summarize what we now know after two guesses.

From Guess 1 (arose):
- A(-)  → A is in the word, but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word, but not in position 5.

From Guess 2 (beach):
- B(-) → B is in the word, but not in position 1.
- E(-) → E is in the word, but not in position 2 (we already knew it wasn’t in 5).
- A(-) → A is in the word, but not in position 3 (we already knew it wasn’t in 1).
- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- H(x) → H is not in the word.

So far we have:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, E, B
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, S, C, H
- Positions we know are wrong for each of A, B, E:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 3
  – B cannot be in position 1
  – E cannot be in positions 2 or 5

We still need to place A, B, E into the 5-letter word, while filling the remaining two spots with letters that have not yet been ruled out.

Remaining unused common consonants: D, F, G, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.
Remaining unused vowels: I, U (since A and E are already confirmed, and O is out).

We need a word that:
1. Contains A, B, E exactly once each.
2. Places A in position 2, 4, or 5.
3. Places B in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
4. Places E in positions 1, 3, or 4.
5. Uses only letters not yet ruled out for the remaining two slots.

One candidate that satisfies these constraints is “BREAD”:
- B is in position 1 → but we know B is not in position 1 (from beach feedback). So BREAD is invalid.

Next candidate: “BEADY” – but Y is allowed, but we need to check positions:
- B in position 1 → invalid (B not in 1).

Next: “PAEBD” – not a valid word.

Let’s try “BALED”:
- B in position 1 → invalid.

“LEAPT” – but we don’t know about P or T yet. Also, lacks A.

“BEAMY” – B in 1 invalid.

“BEADY” – B in 1 invalid.

“PEACH” – H is invalid (from beach feedback).

“PAEON” – O is invalid.

“PAEAN” – A is in position 4 (allowed), B is missing.

We need a word with A, B, E and two new letters. Let’s try “BEGAN”:
- B in 1 invalid.

“BEGED” – not a valid word.

“BEAGL” – not a valid word.

“BEALD” – not a valid word.

“BEARD” – R is invalid.

“BEANS” – S is invalid.

“BEAST” – S is invalid.

“BEAVE” – E appears twice, we don’t know if E is duplicated.

“BEAUX” – X is allowed, but U is unused. Let’s see:
- B in 1 invalid.

“BEAUX” invalid.

“BEAUL” – not a word.

“BEAUM” – not a word.

“BEAUN” – not a word.

“BEAUP” – not a word.

“BEAUR” – R invalid.

“BEAUS” – S invalid.

“BEAUT” – T is allowed, U is allowed, but:
- B in 1 invalid.

We need to place B somewhere other than 1. Let’s try “PEACH” – H invalid.

“PEAGE” – G is allowed, but A appears twice.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that can help eliminate or confirm many letters early.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels quickly.
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S).
3. All letters are among the most frequent in English.
4. It has no repeated letters, maximizing information gain.

This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities for the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong spots): A, E
- Positions to avoid for A: 1
- Positions to avoid for E: 5

Next, I want a word that:
1. Contains both A and E (since they’re confirmed present).
2. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
3. Places E somewhere other than position 5.
4. Avoids R, O, S entirely.
5. Uses other common letters to maximize new information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, G, B, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (but A and E are already confirmed).

A balanced word that satisfies these constraints is “TABLE”:
- Contains A (position 2) and E (position 5) – but wait, E is in position 5 which is invalid (feedback says E is not in position 5). So TABLE is invalid.

Next option: “ELATE” – but E in position 1 is allowed, A in position 2 is allowed, E in position 3 is allowed, but we already know E is in the word (but not in position 5). However, ELATE has two E’s – but we don’t know if E is duplicated. To avoid assuming duplicates, let’s pick a word with distinct letters.

Better choice: “TAPED” – but it has E in position 4 (allowed) and A in position 2 (allowed), and avoids R, O, S. However, “TAPED” uses P and D which are less common. Let’s prefer more common letters.

Another option: “LATER” – but R is invalid. “PLAID” – but D is less common.

Let’s try “BEACH”:
- B, E, A, C, H
- E is in position 2 (allowed)
- A is in position 3 (allowed)
- Avoids R, O, S
- Uses common letters B, C, H

This seems good. Let’s go with BEACH.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all: R, O, S, C, H  
Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown: A, E, B

Positions ruled out so far:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3  
- E cannot be in positions 3, 5  
- B cannot be in position 1  

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, E, B exactly once each.  
2. Places A only in positions 2, 4, 5.  
3. Places E only in positions 1, 2, 4.  
4. Places B only in positions 2, 3, 4, 5.  
5. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no R, O, S, C, H).

Good remaining consonants: D, F, G, K, L, M, N, P, T, W, Y, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U (but we already have A and E).

Let’s look for words that fit the constraints.  
A promising candidate is “BLADE”:
- B in position 1 is invalid (B cannot be in position 1).  
Next: “BEARD” – R is invalid.  
“LEAPT” – missing A or E.  
“TABLE” – E in position 5 is invalid.  
“PLATE” – E in position 5 is invalid.  
“GLADE” – E in position 5 is invalid.  
“BLOAT” – O is invalid.  
“PLUMB” – missing E.  
“BLEAT” – E in position 4 is allowed, A in position 3 is invalid.  
“BLEED” – duplicate E, and E in position 5 invalid.  
“BALED” – A in position 1 invalid.  
“BELAY” – Y is allowed, but A in position 4 is allowed, E in position 2 is allowed, B in position 1 is invalid.  
“BEAMY” – B in position 1 invalid.  
“BEGAN” – N is allowed, but G is allowed, A in position 4 is allowed, E in position 2 is allowed, B in position 1 invalid.  
“BEGUM” – missing A.  
“BEGAN” still has B in position 1 invalid.  
“BEGED” – not a word.  
“BEGUM” – missing A.  
“BEGAN” – same issue.  

Let’s try “BEGAN” again: B in position 1 invalid.  
Next: “BEGED” – not valid.  
“BEGUM” – missing A.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that can help eliminate or confirm many letters early.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels quickly.
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S).
3. All letters are among the most frequent in English.
4. It has no repeated letters, maximizing information gain.

This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities for the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong spots): A, E
- Positions to avoid for A: 1
- Positions to avoid for E: 5

Next, I want a word that:
1. Contains both A and E (since they’re confirmed present).
2. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
3. Places E somewhere other than position 5.
4. Avoids R, O, S entirely.
5. Uses other common letters to maximize new information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, G, B, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (but A and E are already confirmed).

A balanced word that satisfies these constraints is “TABLE”:
- Contains A (position 2) and E (position 5) – but wait, E is in position 5 which is invalid (feedback says E is not in position 5). So TABLE is invalid.

Next option: “ELATE” – but E in position 1 is allowed, A in position 2 is allowed, E in position 3 is allowed, but we already know E is in the word (but not in position 5). However, ELATE has two E’s – but we don’t know if E is duplicated. To avoid assuming duplicates, let’s pick a word with distinct letters.

Better choice: “TAPED” – but it has E in position 4 (allowed) and A in position 2 (allowed), and avoids R, O, S. However, “TAPED” uses P and D which are less common. Let’s prefer more common letters.

Another option: “LATER” – but R is invalid. “PLAID” – but D is less common.

Let’s try “BEACH”:
- B, E, A, C, H
- E is in position 2 (allowed)
- A is in position 3 (allowed)
- Avoids R, O, S
- Uses common letters B, C, H

This seems good. Let’s go with BEACH.

We have the following information:

Letters that are **not** in the word at all: R, O, S, C, H  
Letters that **are** in the word but are in the **wrong positions**:  
- A (not in positions 1, 3)  
- E (not in positions 2, 5)  
- B (not in position 1)

We still need a valid 5-letter English word that:
1. Contains A and E (and possibly B).  
2. Places A only in positions 2, 4, or 5.  
3. Places E only in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
4. Places B only in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.  
5. Uses only letters from the allowed set (no R, O, S, C, H).

Let’s list some candidate letters we haven’t ruled out: A, B, D, E, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A good next word should use common remaining letters. Let’s try to use A and E in new positions while introducing new consonants.

Consider “TABLE” – but we already know H is out and C is out, but T, A, B, L, E are still allowed. However, E would be in position 5, which is invalid (feedback says E is not in position 5). So TABLE is out.

Consider “BLADE” – B is in position 1 (invalid), so no.

Consider “PLATE” – P, L, A, T, E. A is in position 3 (invalid), E in 5 (invalid). No.

Consider “ELBOW” – O is out. No.

Consider “BREAD” – R is out. No.

Consider “PEACH” – C and H are out. No.

Consider “BALED” – D is allowed, but E is in position 4 (valid), A in 2 (valid), B in 1 (invalid). No.

Consider “BEADY” – B in 1 (invalid), Y is allowed but let’s stick to common letters.

Consider “BLEAT” – B in 1 (invalid).

Consider “BEAST” – S is out.

Consider “PEAGE” – not a valid word.

Consider “PAEON” – not common.

Consider “LEANT” – N is allowed, T is allowed. A is in 3 (invalid).

Consider “LEAVE” – E is in 5 (invalid).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that can help eliminate or confirm many letters early.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
1. It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify vowels quickly.
2. It has 2 very common consonants (R, S).
3. All letters are among the most frequent in English.
4. It has no repeated letters, maximizing information gain.

This should give us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities for the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we now know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S
- Letters that ARE in the word (but in wrong spots): A, E
- Positions to avoid for A: 1
- Positions to avoid for E: 5

Next, I want a word that:
1. Contains both A and E (since they’re confirmed present).
2. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
3. Places E somewhere other than position 5.
4. Avoids R, O, S entirely.
5. Uses other common letters to maximize new information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, G, B, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (but A and E are already confirmed).

A balanced word that satisfies these constraints is “TABLE”:
- Contains A (position 2) and E (position 5) – but wait, E is in position 5 which is invalid (feedback says E is not in position 5). So TABLE is invalid.

Next option: “ELATE” – but E in position 1 is allowed, A in position 2 is allowed, E in position 3 is allowed, but we already know E is in the word (but not in position 5). However, ELATE has two E’s – but we don’t know if E is duplicated. To avoid assuming duplicates, let’s pick a word with distinct letters.

Better choice: “TAPED” – but it has E in position 4 (allowed) and A in position 2 (allowed), and avoids R, O, S. However, “TAPED” uses P and D which are less common. Let’s prefer more common letters.

Another option: “LATER” – but R is invalid. “PLAID” – but D is less common.

Let’s try “BEACH”:
- B, E, A, C, H
- E is in position 2 (allowed)
- A is in position 3 (allowed)
- Avoids R, O, S
- Uses common letters B, C, H

This seems good. Let’s go with BEACH.
