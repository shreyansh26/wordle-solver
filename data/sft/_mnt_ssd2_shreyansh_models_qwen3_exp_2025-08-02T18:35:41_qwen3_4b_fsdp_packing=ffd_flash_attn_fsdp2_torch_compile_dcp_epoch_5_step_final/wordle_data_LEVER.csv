### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present or absent in the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- L(-) – L is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- The word contains L and E.
- The word does NOT contain S, A, or T.
- L is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.

Next, I want a word that:
- Keeps L and E in new positions.
- Avoids S, A, T entirely.
- Introduces other common consonants and vowels to narrow things down.

Good candidates would use letters like R, N, I, O, C, etc. I’ll choose “LEMON” because:
- It keeps L and E in new spots (positions 1 and 2).
- It introduces M, O, N (common letters not yet tested).
- It avoids S, A, T.

1. SLATE → S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)

   - E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. LEMON → L(✓) E(✓) M(x) O(x) N(x)
   - L is in position 1 (✓).
   - E is in position 2 (✓).
   - M, O, N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word starts with L E _ _ _
- Letters NOT in the word: S, A, T, M, O, N
- Remaining possible letters (from the alphabet minus the excluded ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- We still need to test common consonants and vowels.

A good next guess should:
- Keep L E in positions 1-2.
- Introduce new common letters (like R, I, D, C, etc.).
- Avoid all excluded letters.
