### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. The best starting words often contain vowels and common consonants. After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", and ""RAISE"", I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has:
- C: common consonant
- R: very common consonant
- A: common vowel
- N: common consonant
- E: the most common vowel

This should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

From the two guesses we have:

2. PLANE → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(-) E(✓)
   - Word still ends in E.
   - A and N are still in the word but still not in positions 2 & 4 respectively.

So far we know:
- Position 5 = E
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3.
- N is in the word but NOT in positions 3 or 4.

That leaves A possible in positions 1 or 4, and N possible in positions 1 or 2.

- Contains A and N
- A not in 2 or 3 → so 1 or 4

- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (no C, R, P, L)

Let me think of words that fit:

- A in 4: _ _ _ A E
- N in 1: N _ _ _ E
- N in 2: _ N _ _ E

From the new feedback on ANISE:

- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
- N(✓) – N is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- I(✓) – I is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).

So the word pattern is now fully determined: A N I _ E.

We only need to find the correct 4th letter. The remaining letters must not include C, R, P, L, S (and any others already ruled out).

Possible letters for position 4 (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching A N I _ E:

- ANIME – but S is already ruled out, and M is allowed, but we need to check if this is the only possibility.
- ANILE – not a common word.
- ANISE – already tried.
- ANIME is a valid word.

Let me verify: ANIME fits A N I _ E with M as the missing letter, and M hasn’t been ruled out yet. This seems to be the only common word left that fits the pattern.

Therefore, the next logical guess is ANIME.
