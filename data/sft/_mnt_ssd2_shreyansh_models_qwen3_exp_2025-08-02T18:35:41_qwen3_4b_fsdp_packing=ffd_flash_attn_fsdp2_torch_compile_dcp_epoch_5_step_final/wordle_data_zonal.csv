For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common vowels and consonants.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to test their presence in the secret word.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(-): O is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E
- Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: A (not at start), O (not at position 3)

We need a word that:
1. Contains A and O, but not at positions 1 and 3 respectively.
2. Does not contain R, S, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters to try: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

A word that fits these constraints is ""DOING"":
- D, I, N, G are all new letters.
- O is in position 2 (not 3, so it satisfies the feedback).
- A is not present, but we can check if A is in other positions next time if needed. However, since we know A is in the word, let's try a word that includes A in a different position.

Let's try ""OCEAN"":
- Contains O (position 1, which is new for O).
- Contains A (position 4, which is new for A).
- Uses new letters C, E, N. But E is already ruled out, so this is bad.

Next try ""PLAID"":
- P, L, I, D are new.
- A is in position 2 (new position for A).
- O is not present, but we know O is in the word, so this misses O.

Next try ""TONAL"":
- T, N, L are new.
- O is in position 1 (new position for O).
- A is in position 4 (new position for A).
- No R, S, E.

This seems good: it tests O in position 1 and A in position 4, while introducing new letters T, N, L.

But let's see if we can do better. Another option is ""TONIC"":
- T, N, I, C are new.
- O in position 1 (new position for O).
- No A, but we know A is in the word, so this misses A.

We must include A and O. Next try ""PAINT"":

Next try ""GLOAT"":
- G, L, T are new.
- O in position 2 (new for O).
- A in position 4 (new for A).
- No R, S, E.

This seems optimal: it includes both A and O in new positions while introducing new letters G, L, T.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
R, S, E, G, T

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
L (wrong position in gloat, so not position 2)
O (wrong position in arose, not position 3; wrong position in gloat, not position 3 again; so O is definitely in the word but not at position 3)
A (correct in position 4 from gloat)

So the secret word has:
- A fixed in position 4
- Contains L somewhere (but not position 2)
- Contains O somewhere (but not position 3)
- Does NOT contain R, S, E, G, T

We need a 5-letter word with:
- _ _ _ A _
- L somewhere (positions 1,3,4,5; but 4 is A, so 1,3,5)
- O somewhere (positions 1,2,4,5; but 4 is A, so 1,2,5)

Also, we want to introduce new common letters to maximize information. The remaining common letters we haven't tried are N, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

Possible candidates:
- If O is in position 1: O _ _ A _
- If O is in position 2: _ O _ A _
- If O is in position 5: _ _ _ A O

And L must be in 1,3, or 5.

Let's try to build a word:
Option 1: O _ L A _ → O L A A _ (invalid, double A)
Option 2: O _ _ A L → O _ _ A L (needs two more letters)
Option 3: _ O _ A L → _ O _ A L (needs two more letters)
Option 4: _ _ L A O → _ _ L A O (needs three more letters)

Let's pick _ O L A _ → possible word ""COBAL"" (but not common)
Better: ""FOCAL"" - but F is less common
""POLAR"" - but R is out
""MOBAL"" - not a word
""COBAL"" - not a word
""HOBAL"" - not a word

Alternative: _ O _ A L → ""COBAL"" again
Better: ""DOBAL"" - not a word
""BOCAL"" - not standard
""VOCAL"" - not standard

Alternative: O _ _ A L → ""OPIAL"" - not a word
""ONIAL"" - not a word
""OCIAL"" - not a word

Alternative: _ _ L A O → ""CLADO"" - not a word
""PLANO"" - but P is new, N is new, L is in position 3 (allowed), A in 4, O in 5 (allowed)
""PLANO"" is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- A is in position 4 (✓)
- L is in position 3 (allowed, since L is not in position 2)
- O is in position 5 (allowed, since O is not in position 3)
- No R, S, E, G, T (✓)
- Introduces new letters P, N (✓)

This seems optimal.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common vowels and consonants.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to test their presence in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(-): O is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E
- Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: A (not at start), O (not at position 3)

We need a word that:
1. Contains A and O, but not at positions 1 and 3 respectively.
2. Does not contain R, S, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters to try: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

A word that fits these constraints is ""DOING"":
- D, I, N, G are all new letters.
- O is in position 2 (not 3, so it satisfies the feedback).
- A is not present, but we can check if A is in other positions next time if needed. However, since we know A is in the word, let's try a word that includes A in a different position.

Let's try ""OCEAN"":
- Contains O (position 1, which is new for O).
- Contains A (position 4, which is new for A).
- Uses new letters C, E, N. But E is already ruled out, so this is bad.

Next try ""PLAID"":
- P, L, I, D are new.
- A is in position 2 (new position for A).
- O is not present, but we know O is in the word, so this misses O.

Next try ""TONAL"":
- T, N, L are new.
- O is in position 1 (new position for O).
- A is in position 4 (new position for A).
- No R, S, E.

This seems good: it tests O in position 1 and A in position 4, while introducing new letters T, N, L.

But let's see if we can do better. Another option is ""TONIC"":
- T, N, I, C are new.
- O in position 1 (new position for O).
- No A, but we know A is in the word, so this misses A.

We must include A and O. Next try ""PAINT"":
- P, I, N, T are new.
- A in position 2 (new for A).
- O is not present, so this misses O.

Next try ""GLOAT"":
- G, L, T are new.
- O in position 2 (new for O).
- A in position 4 (new for A).
- No R, S, E.

This seems optimal: it includes both A and O in new positions while introducing new letters G, L, T.

Guess 2: gloat -> FEEDBACK: G(x) L(-) O(-) A(✓) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
R, S, E, G, T

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
L (wrong position in gloat, so not position 2)
O (wrong position in arose, not position 3; wrong position in gloat, not position 3 again; so O is definitely in the word but not at position 3)
A (correct in position 4 from gloat)

So the secret word has:
- A fixed in position 4
- Contains L somewhere (but not position 2)
- Contains O somewhere (but not position 3)
- Does NOT contain R, S, E, G, T

We need a 5-letter word with:
- _ _ _ A _
- L somewhere (positions 1,3,4,5; but 4 is A, so 1,3,5)
- O somewhere (positions 1,2,4,5; but 4 is A, so 1,2,5)

Also, we want to introduce new common letters to maximize information. The remaining common letters we haven't tried are N, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

Possible candidates:
- If O is in position 1: O _ _ A _
- If O is in position 2: _ O _ A _
- If O is in position 5: _ _ _ A O

And L must be in 1,3, or 5.

Let's try to build a word:
Option 1: O _ L A _ → O L A A _ (invalid, double A)
Option 2: O _ _ A L → O _ _ A L (needs two more letters)
Option 3: _ O _ A L → _ O _ A L (needs two more letters)
Option 4: _ _ L A O → _ _ L A O (needs three more letters)

Let's pick _ O L A _ → possible word ""COBAL"" (but not common)
Better: ""FOCAL"" - but F is less common
""POLAR"" - but R is out
""MOBAL"" - not a word
""COBAL"" - not a word
""HOBAL"" - not a word

Alternative: _ O _ A L → ""COBAL"" again
Better: ""DOBAL"" - not a word
""BOCAL"" - not standard
""VOCAL"" - not standard

Alternative: O _ _ A L → ""OPIAL"" - not a word
""ONIAL"" - not a word
""OCIAL"" - not a word

Alternative: _ _ L A O → ""CLADO"" - not a word
""PLANO"" - but P is new, N is new, L is in position 3 (allowed), A in 4, O in 5 (allowed)
""PLANO"" is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- A is in position 4 (✓)
- L is in position 3 (allowed, since L is not in position 2)
- O is in position 5 (allowed, since O is not in position 3)
- No R, S, E, G, T (✓)
- Introduces new letters P, N (✓)

This seems optimal.

Let's carefully update what we know after the three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
R, S, E, G, T, P

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
L (wrong position in gloat, not position 2; wrong position in plano, not position 2 again)  
O (wrong position in arose, not position 3; wrong position in gloat, not position 3; wrong position in plano, not position 5)  
A (correct in position 4 from gloat, but now gloat’s A was in position 4 and feedback said A(✓), so A is fixed in position 4)  
N (wrong position in plano, not position 4)

So the word structure is:
_ _ _ A _

Known letters to place: L, O, N  
Known exclusions for each:
- L: not position 2  
- O: not positions 3 or 5  
- N: not position 4  

Possible positions for O: 1 or 2 (since 3,4,5 are excluded)  
Possible positions for L: 1, 3, or 5  
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, or 3 or 5  

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 4
- Exactly one L, one O, one N, and two other letters that are NOT R, S, E, G, T, P.

Let's list possible patterns:

Pattern 1: O in position 1  
Then we have: O _ _ A _  
We still need L and N in positions 2,3,5 with constraints:
- L not in 2 → must be in 3 or 5  
- N not in 4 (already satisfied)  

Possible:
- O N L A _ → but we need one more letter (position 5) that is not excluded.  
- O L N A _ → same issue.

Pattern 2: O in position 2  
Then we have: _ O _ A _  
Now L and N must fit in positions 1,3,5 with:
- L not in 2 (already satisfied)  
- N not in 4 (already satisfied)  

Possible:
- N O L A _ → needs a 5th letter (position 5) that is not excluded.  
- L O N A _ → same.  
- _ O N A L → same.  
- _ O L A N → same.  

Let's try to find a valid word from these patterns.

Looking at pattern 2 with _ O N A L:  
Possible first letters (not excluded): B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try ""CONAL"" - but C is allowed, but is ""CONAL"" a word? Not standard.  
Try ""HONAL"" - not a word.  
Try ""MONAL"" - ""MONAL"" is a variant spelling of ""monal"" (a type of bird), but not common.  
Try ""POLAR"" - but P is excluded.  
Try ""VONAL"" - not a word.

Pattern 2 with _ O L A N:  
Possible first letters:  
""COLAN"" - not a word.  
""FLON"" is 4 letters.  
""JOLAN"" - not a word.  
""MONAL"" - same as above.  
""POLAR"" - P excluded.  
""SONAL"" - S excluded.  

Pattern 1 with O N L A _ :  
Need a 5th letter for position 5.  
""ONLAY"" - but Y is allowed, and ""ONLAY"" is a word (a layer of onyx).  
Check constraints:  
- O in 1 (allowed)  
- N in 2 (allowed)  
- L in 3 (allowed)  
- A in 4 (fixed)  
- Y in 5 (not excluded)  
- No R,S,E,G,T,P (✓)  

This seems valid.

Another option: O L N A _ :  
""OLNAX"" - not a word.  
""OLNAR"" - R excluded.  

Another pattern: _ O N A L with first letter ""F"" gives ""FONAL"" - not a word.  
With first letter ""D"" gives ""DONAL"" - ""DONAL"" is a name but not a standard word.  
With first letter ""B"" gives ""BONAL"" - not a word.  

""ONLAY"" seems the best candidate.

Let's verify ""ONLAY"":
- O in position 1 (allowed)  
- N in position 2 (allowed)  
- L in position 3 (allowed)  
- A in position 4 (fixed)  
- Y in position 5 (allowed)  
- No excluded letters (R,S,E,G,T,P)  
- Valid English word (""onlay"" is a noun meaning a thin layer of material used in dentistry).

This fits all constraints.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common vowels and consonants.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to test their presence in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(-): O is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E
- Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: A (not at start), O (not at position 3)

We need a word that:
1. Contains A and O, but not at positions 1 and 3 respectively.
2. Does not contain R, S, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters to try: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

A word that fits these constraints is ""DOING"":
- D, I, N, G are all new letters.
- O is in position 2 (not 3, so it satisfies the feedback).
- A is not present, but we can check if A is in other positions next time if needed. However, since we know A is in the word, let's try a word that includes A in a different position.

Let's try ""OCEAN"":
- Contains O (position 1, which is new for O).
- Contains A (position 4, which is new for A).
- Uses new letters C, E, N. But E is already ruled out, so this is bad.

Next try ""PLAID"":
- P, L, I, D are new.
- A is in position 2 (new position for A).
- O is not present, but we know O is in the word, so this misses O.

Next try ""TONAL"":
- T, N, L are new.
- O is in position 1 (new position for O).
- A is in position 4 (new position for A).
- No R, S, E.

This seems good: it tests O in position 1 and A in position 4, while introducing new letters T, N, L.

But let's see if we can do better. Another option is ""TONIC"":
- T, N, I, C are new.
- O in position 1 (new position for O).
- No A, but we know A is in the word, so this misses A.

We must include A and O. Next try ""PAINT"":
- P, I, N, T are new.
- A in position 2 (new for A).
- O is not present, so this misses O.

Next try ""GLOAT"":
- G, L, T are new.
- O in position 2 (new for O).
- A in position 4 (new for A).
- No R, S, E.

This seems optimal: it includes both A and O in new positions while introducing new letters G, L, T.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: gloat -> FEEDBACK: G(x) L(-) O(-) A(✓) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
R, S, E, G, T

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
L (wrong position in gloat, so not position 2)
O (wrong position in arose, not position 3; wrong position in gloat, not position 3 again; so O is definitely in the word but not at position 3)
A (correct in position 4 from gloat)

So the secret word has:
- A fixed in position 4
- Contains L somewhere (but not position 2)
- Contains O somewhere (but not position 3)
- Does NOT contain R, S, E, G, T

We need a 5-letter word with:
- _ _ _ A _
- L somewhere (positions 1,3,4,5; but 4 is A, so 1,3,5)
- O somewhere (positions 1,2,4,5; but 4 is A, so 1,2,5)

Also, we want to introduce new common letters to maximize information. The remaining common letters we haven't tried are N, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

Possible candidates:
- If O is in position 1: O _ _ A _
- If O is in position 2: _ O _ A _
- If O is in position 5: _ _ _ A O

And L must be in 1,3, or 5.

Let's try to build a word:
Option 1: O _ L A _ → O L A A _ (invalid, double A)
Option 2: O _ _ A L → O _ _ A L (needs two more letters)
Option 3: _ O _ A L → _ O _ A L (needs two more letters)
Option 4: _ _ L A O → _ _ L A O (needs three more letters)

Let's pick _ O L A _ → possible word ""COBAL"" (but not common)
Better: ""FOCAL"" - but F is less common
""POLAR"" - but R is out
""MOBAL"" - not a word
""COBAL"" - not a word
""HOBAL"" - not a word

Alternative: _ O _ A L → ""COBAL"" again
Better: ""DOBAL"" - not a word
""BOCAL"" - not standard
""VOCAL"" - not standard

Alternative: O _ _ A L → ""OPIAL"" - not a word
""ONIAL"" - not a word
""OCIAL"" - not a word

Alternative: _ _ L A O → ""CLADO"" - not a word
""PLANO"" - but P is new, N is new, L is in position 3 (allowed), A in 4, O in 5 (allowed)
""PLANO"" is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- A is in position 4 (✓)
- L is in position 3 (allowed, since L is not in position 2)
- O is in position 5 (allowed, since O is not in position 3)
- No R, S, E, G, T (✓)
- Introduces new letters P, N (✓)

This seems optimal.

Let's carefully update what we know after the three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
R, S, E, G, T, P

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
L (wrong position in gloat, not position 2; wrong position in plano, not position 2 again)  
O (wrong position in arose, not position 3; wrong position in gloat, not position 3; wrong position in plano, not position 5)  
A (correct in position 4 from gloat, but now gloat’s A was in position 4 and feedback said A(✓), so A is fixed in position 4)  
N (wrong position in plano, not position 4)

So the word structure is:
_ _ _ A _

Known letters to place: L, O, N  
Known exclusions for each:
- L: not position 2  
- O: not positions 3 or 5  
- N: not position 4  

Possible positions for O: 1 or 2 (since 3,4,5 are excluded)  
Possible positions for L: 1, 3, or 5  
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, or 3 or 5  

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 4
- Exactly one L, one O, one N, and two other letters that are NOT R, S, E, G, T, P.

Let's list possible patterns:

Pattern 1: O in position 1  
Then we have: O _ _ A _  
We still need L and N in positions 2,3,5 with constraints:
- L not in 2 → must be in 3 or 5  
- N not in 4 (already satisfied)  

Possible:
- O N L A _ → but we need one more letter (position 5) that is not excluded.  
- O L N A _ → same issue.

Pattern 2: O in position 2  
Then we have: _ O _ A _  
Now L and N must fit in positions 1,3,5 with:
- L not in 2 (already satisfied)  
- N not in 4 (already satisfied)  

Possible:
- N O L A _ → needs a 5th letter (position 5) that is not excluded.  
- L O N A _ → same.  
- _ O N A L → same.  
- _ O L A N → same.  

Let's try to find a valid word from these patterns.

Looking at pattern 2 with _ O N A L:  
Possible first letters (not excluded): B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try ""CONAL"" - but C is allowed, but is ""CONAL"" a word? Not standard.  
Try ""HONAL"" - not a word.  
Try ""MONAL"" - ""MONAL"" is a variant spelling of ""monal"" (a type of bird), but not common.  
Try ""POLAR"" - but P is excluded.  
Try ""VONAL"" - not a word.

Pattern 2 with _ O L A N:  
Possible first letters:  
""COLAN"" - not a word.  
""FLON"" is 4 letters.  
""JOLAN"" - not a word.  
""MONAL"" - same as above.  
""POLAR"" - P excluded.  
""SONAL"" - S excluded.  

Pattern 1 with O N L A _ :  
Need a 5th letter for position 5.  
""ONLAY"" - but Y is allowed, and ""ONLAY"" is a word (a layer of onyx).  
Check constraints:  
- O in 1 (allowed)  
- N in 2 (allowed)  
- L in 3 (allowed)  
- A in 4 (fixed)  
- Y in 5 (not excluded)  
- No R,S,E,G,T,P (✓)  

This seems valid.

Another option: O L N A _ :  
""OLNAX"" - not a word.  
""OLNAR"" - R excluded.  

Another pattern: _ O N A L with first letter ""F"" gives ""FONAL"" - not a word.  
With first letter ""D"" gives ""DONAL"" - ""DONAL"" is a name but not a standard word.  
With first letter ""B"" gives ""BONAL"" - not a word.  

""ONLAY"" seems the best candidate.

Let's verify ""ONLAY"":
- O in position 1 (allowed)  
- N in position 2 (allowed)  
- L in position 3 (allowed)  
- A in position 4 (fixed)  
- Y in position 5 (allowed)  
- No excluded letters (R,S,E,G,T,P)  
- Valid English word (""onlay"" is a noun meaning a thin layer of material used in dentistry).

This fits all constraints.

Let's update the knowledge after the fourth guess.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
R, S, E, G, T, P, Y

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
L (wrong positions in gloat: 2, plano: 2, onlay: 3)  
O (wrong positions in arose: 3, gloat: 3, plano: 5, onlay: 1)  
A (fixed in position 4)  
N (wrong positions in plano: 4, onlay: 2)

So the word structure is:
_ _ _ A _

Known letters to place: L, O, N  
Known exclusions for each:
- L: not positions 2 or 3 → must be in 1 or 5  
- O: not positions 1, 3, 5 → must be in 2  
- N: not positions 2 or 4 → must be in 1, 3 or 5  

From above, O must be in position 2.  
So the pattern is: _ O _ A _

Now we have:
- Position 1: must be one of the remaining letters (not excluded)  
- Position 3: must be one of the remaining letters (not excluded)  
- Position 5: must be one of the remaining letters (not excluded)  

But we still need to place L and N in positions 1,3,5 with the exclusions:
- L: not 2 or 3 → must be in 1 or 5  
- N: not 2 or 4 → must be in 1, 3 or 5  

Let's list possible placements:

Case 1: L in position 1  
Then N must be in 3 or 5  
- L O N A _ → needs a 5th letter (position 5) that is not excluded.  
- L O _ A N → needs a 3rd letter (position 3) that is not excluded.

Case 2: L in position 5  
Then N must be in 1 or 3  
- _ O N A L → needs a 1st letter (position 1) that is not excluded.  
- _ O _ A L → needs a 3rd letter (position 3) that is not excluded.

We need to find valid 5-letter words that fit these patterns with the remaining letters (not excluded: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).

Let's explore:

Case 1: L O N A _  
Possible 5th letters: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  
""LONGA"" - not a word.  
""LONER"" - R excluded.  
""LONER"" invalid.  
""LONED"" - not a word.  
""LONIC"" - not a word.  
""LONER"" invalid.  

Case 2: L O _ A N  
Possible 3rd letters: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  
""LOBA N"" - not a word.  
""LOCA N"" - not a word.  
""LODAN"" - not a word.  
""LOFAN"" - not a word.  
""LOHAN"" - ""LOHAN"" is a word (variant of ""Lohan"").  
""LOHAN"" fits:
- L O H A N  
Check constraints:  
- L in 1 (allowed)  
- O in 2 (fixed)  
- H not excluded  
- A in 4 (fixed)  
- N in 5 (allowed)  
- No excluded letters (R,S,E,G,T,P,Y)  
- Valid English word.

Case 2: _ O N A L  
Possible 1st letters: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z  
""CONAL"" - not a word.

<guess>focal</guess>",focal,"Let's update the knowledge after the fourth guess.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
R, S, E, G, T, P, Y

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
L (wrong positions in gloat: 2, plano: 2, onlay: 3)  
O (wrong positions in arose: 3, gloat: 3, plano: 5, onlay: 1)  
A (fixed in position 4)  
N (wrong positions in plano: 4, onlay: 2)

So the word structure is:
_ _ _ A _

Known letters to place: L, O, N  
Known exclusions for each:
- L: not positions 2 or 3 → must be in 1 or 5  
- O: not positions 1, 3, 5 → must be in 2  
- N: not positions 2 or 4 → must be in 1, 3 or 5  

From above, O must be in position 2.  
So the pattern is: _ O _ A _

Now we have:
- Position 1: must be one of the remaining letters (not excluded)  
- Position 3: must be one of the remaining letters (not excluded)  
- Position 5: must be one of the remaining letters (not excluded)  

But we still need to place L and N in positions 1,3,5 with the exclusions:
- L: not 2 or 3 → must be in 1 or 5  
- N: not 2 or 4 → must be in 1, 3 or 5  

Let's list possible placements:

Case 1: L in position 1  
Then N must be in 3 or 5  
- L O N A _ → needs a 5th letter (position 5) that is not excluded.  
- L O _ A N → needs a 3rd letter (position 3) that is not excluded.

Case 2: L in position 5  
Then N must be in 1 or 3  
- _ O N A L → needs a 1st letter (position 1) that is not excluded.  
- _ O _ A L → needs a 3rd letter (position 3) that is not excluded.

We need to find valid 5-letter words that fit these patterns with the remaining letters (not excluded: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with a mix of these common vowels and consonants.

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to test their presence in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(-): O is in the word but in the wrong position (not position 3).
- S(x): S is not in the word at all.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, S, E
- Letters that ARE in the word but in the wrong positions: A (not at start), O (not at position 3)

We need a word that:
1. Contains A and O, but not at positions 1 and 3 respectively.
2. Does not contain R, S, or E.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters to try: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

A word that fits these constraints is ""DOING"":
- D, I, N, G are all new letters.
- O is in position 2 (not 3, so it satisfies the feedback).
- A is not present, but we can check if A is in other positions next time if needed. However, since we know A is in the word, let's try a word that includes A in a different position.

Let's try ""OCEAN"":
- Contains O (position 1, which is new for O).
- Contains A (position 4, which is new for A).
- Uses new letters C, E, N. But E is already ruled out, so this is bad.

Next try ""PLAID"":
- P, L, I, D are new.
- A is in position 2 (new position for A).
- O is not present, but we know O is in the word, so this misses O.

Next try ""TONAL"":
- T, N, L are new.
- O is in position 1 (new position for O).
- A is in position 4 (new position for A).
- No R, S, E.

This seems good: it tests O in position 1 and A in position 4, while introducing new letters T, N, L.

But let's see if we can do better. Another option is ""TONIC"":
- T, N, I, C are new.
- O in position 1 (new position for O).
- No A, but we know A is in the word, so this misses A.

We must include A and O. Next try ""PAINT"":
- P, I, N, T are new.
- A in position 2 (new for A).
- O is not present, so this misses O.

Next try ""GLOAT"":
- G, L, T are new.
- O in position 2 (new for O).
- A in position 4 (new for A).
- No R, S, E.

This seems optimal: it includes both A and O in new positions while introducing new letters G, L, T.

Guess 2: gloat -> FEEDBACK: G(x) L(-) O(-) A(✓) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
R, S, E, G, T

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
L (wrong position in gloat, so not position 2)
O (wrong position in arose, not position 3; wrong position in gloat, not position 3 again; so O is definitely in the word but not at position 3)
A (correct in position 4 from gloat)

So the secret word has:
- A fixed in position 4
- Contains L somewhere (but not position 2)
- Contains O somewhere (but not position 3)
- Does NOT contain R, S, E, G, T

We need a 5-letter word with:
- _ _ _ A _
- L somewhere (positions 1,3,4,5; but 4 is A, so 1,3,5)
- O somewhere (positions 1,2,4,5; but 4 is A, so 1,2,5)

Also, we want to introduce new common letters to maximize information. The remaining common letters we haven't tried are N, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

Possible candidates:
- If O is in position 1: O _ _ A _
- If O is in position 2: _ O _ A _
- If O is in position 5: _ _ _ A O

And L must be in 1,3, or 5.

Let's try to build a word:
Option 1: O _ L A _ → O L A A _ (invalid, double A)
Option 2: O _ _ A L → O _ _ A L (needs two more letters)
Option 3: _ O _ A L → _ O _ A L (needs two more letters)
Option 4: _ _ L A O → _ _ L A O (needs three more letters)

Let's pick _ O L A _ → possible word ""COBAL"" (but not common)
Better: ""FOCAL"" - but F is less common
""POLAR"" - but R is out
""MOBAL"" - not a word
""COBAL"" - not a word
""HOBAL"" - not a word

Alternative: _ O _ A L → ""COBAL"" again
Better: ""DOBAL"" - not a word
""BOCAL"" - not standard
""VOCAL"" - not standard

Alternative: O _ _ A L → ""OPIAL"" - not a word
""ONIAL"" - not a word
""OCIAL"" - not a word

Alternative: _ _ L A O → ""CLADO"" - not a word
""PLANO"" - but P is new, N is new, L is in position 3 (allowed), A in 4, O in 5 (allowed)
""PLANO"" is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- A is in position 4 (✓)
- L is in position 3 (allowed, since L is not in position 2)
- O is in position 5 (allowed, since O is not in position 3)
- No R, S, E, G, T (✓)
- Introduces new letters P, N (✓)

This seems optimal.

Let's carefully update what we know after the three guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
R, S, E, G, T, P

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
L (wrong position in gloat, not position 2; wrong position in plano, not position 2 again)  
O (wrong position in arose, not position 3; wrong position in gloat, not position 3; wrong position in plano, not position 5)  
A (correct in position 4 from gloat, but now gloat’s A was in position 4 and feedback said A(✓), so A is fixed in position 4)  
N (wrong position in plano, not position 4)

So the word structure is:
_ _ _ A _

Known letters to place: L, O, N  
Known exclusions for each:
- L: not position 2  
- O: not positions 3 or 5  
- N: not position 4  

Possible positions for O: 1 or 2 (since 3,4,5 are excluded)  
Possible positions for L: 1, 3, or 5  
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, or 3 or 5  

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 4
- Exactly one L, one O, one N, and two other letters that are NOT R, S, E, G, T, P.

Let's list possible patterns:

Pattern 1: O in position 1  
Then we have: O _ _ A _  
We still need L and N in positions 2,3,5 with constraints:
- L not in 2 → must be in 3 or 5  
- N not in 4 (already satisfied)  

Possible:
- O N L A _ → but we need one more letter (position 5) that is not excluded.  
- O L N A _ → same issue.

Pattern 2: O in position 2  
Then we have: _ O _ A _  
Now L and N must fit in positions 1,3,5 with:
- L not in 2 (already satisfied)  
- N not in 4 (already satisfied)  

Possible:
- N O L A _ → needs a 5th letter (position 5) that is not excluded.  
- L O N A _ → same.  
- _ O N A L → same.  
- _ O L A N → same.  

Let's try to find a valid word from these patterns.

Looking at pattern 2 with _ O N A L:  
Possible first letters (not excluded): B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Try ""CONAL"" - but C is allowed, but is ""CONAL"" a word? Not standard.  
Try ""HONAL"" - not a word.  
Try ""MONAL"" - ""MONAL"" is a variant spelling of ""monal"" (a type of bird), but not common.  
Try ""POLAR"" - but P is excluded.  
Try ""VONAL"" - not a word.

Pattern 2 with _ O L A N:  
Possible first letters:  
""COLAN"" - not a word.  
""FLON"" is 4 letters.  
""JOLAN"" - not a word.  
""MONAL"" - same as above.  
""POLAR"" - P excluded.  
""SONAL"" - S excluded.  

Pattern 1 with O N L A _ :  
Need a 5th letter for position 5.  
""ONLAY"" - but Y is allowed, and ""ONLAY"" is a word (a layer of onyx).  
Check constraints:  
- O in 1 (allowed)  
- N in 2 (allowed)  
- L in 3 (allowed)  
- A in 4 (fixed)  
- Y in 5 (not excluded)  
- No R,S,E,G,T,P (✓)  

This seems valid.

Another option: O L N A _ :  
""OLNAX"" - not a word.  
""OLNAR"" - R excluded.  

Another pattern: _ O N A L with first letter ""F"" gives ""FONAL"" - not a word.  
With first letter ""D"" gives ""DONAL"" - ""DONAL"" is a name but not a standard word.  
With first letter ""B"" gives ""BONAL"" - not a word.  

""ONLAY"" seems the best candidate.

Let's verify ""ONLAY"":
- O in position 1 (allowed)  
- N in position 2 (allowed)  
- L in position 3 (allowed)  
- A in position 4 (fixed)  
- Y in position 5 (allowed)  
- No excluded letters (R,S,E,G,T,P)  
- Valid English word (""onlay"" is a noun meaning a thin layer of material used in dentistry).

This fits all constraints.

Let's update the knowledge after the fourth guess.

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:

Letters that ARE in the word but whose positions are still unknown:
L (wrong positions in gloat: 2, plano: 2, onlay: 3)  
O (wrong positions in arose: 3, gloat: 3, plano: 5, onlay: 1)  
A (fixed in position 4)  
N (wrong positions in plano: 4, onlay: 2)

So the word structure is:
_ _ _ A _

Known letters to place: L, O, N  
Known exclusions for each:
- L: not positions 2 or 3 → must be in 1 or 5  
- O: not positions 1, 3, 5 → must be in 2  
- N: not positions 2 or 4 → must be in 1, 3 or 5  

From above, O must be in position 2.  
So the pattern is: _ O _ A _

Now we have:
- Position 1: must be one of the remaining letters (not excluded)  
- Position 3: must be one of the remaining letters (not excluded)  
- Position 5: must be one of the remaining letters (not excluded)  

But we still need to place L and N in positions 1,3,5 with the exclusions:
- L: not 2 or 3 → must be in 1 or 5  
- N: not 2 or 4 → must be in 1, 3 or 5  

Let's list possible placements:

Case 1: L in position 1  
Then N must be in 3 or 5  
- L O N A _ → needs a 5th letter (position 5) that is not excluded.  
- L O _ A N → needs a 3rd letter (position 3) that is not excluded.

Case 2: L in position 5  
Then N must be in 1 or 3  
- _ O N A L → needs a 1st letter (position 1) that is not excluded.  
- _ O _ A L → needs a 3rd letter (position 3) that is not excluded.

We need to find valid 5-letter words that fit these patterns with the remaining letters (not excluded: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).

Let's explore:

Common remaining consonants: B, D, H, I, K, M, N, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form ? O ? A L.

Possible candidates:

N O ? A L → ""N O ? A L"" – no common word  
V O ? A L → ""VONAL"" (invalid)  

The only valid word fitting the pattern is ""MONAL"".
