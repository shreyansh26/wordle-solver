### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information

Looking at letter frequency in English, some of the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. A popular starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are present and their possible positions.

- R(-) : R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x) : O is NOT in the word

No repeated letters to maximize information\n\nLooking at letter frequency in English, some of the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I. A popular starting word is ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are present and their possible positions.\n\n<guess>arose</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on AROSE:\n- A(-) : A is in the word but not in position 1\n- R(-) : R is in the word but not in position 2\n- O(x) : O is NOT in the word\n- S(x) : S is NOT the word\n- E(x) : E is NOT the word\n\nSo we know:\n- The word contains A and R, but they are not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.\n- The word does NOT contain O, S, or E.\n\nGood next guesses should:\n1.

From all feedback so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
2. train → T(-) R(-) A(✓) I(x) N(x)
3. ratch → R(-) A(-) T(-) C(-) H(-)

What we know for sure:
- A is in the word and is in position 3 (✓ from train).
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 1 (from arose, train, ratch).
- T is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from train, ratch).
- C and H are in the word but in the wrong positions (from ratch).
- Letters NOT in the word: O, S, E, I, N.

So positions:
- 3rd letter = A (fixed)
- R must be in position 4 or 5 (since it can’t be 1,2,3)
- T must be in position 4 or 5 (since it can’t be 1,2,3)
- C and H must be in positions 1,2,4,5 but not where they were last time (C not 4, H not 5).

But we have only two open positions (4 and 5) for R and T, and they must both go there. That’s impossible unless one of them is repeated, which isn’t allowed. Therefore, my interpretation must be wrong.

Wait: the feedback for ratch shows each letter as (-), meaning they are in the word but in wrong positions. So:
- R is in the word but not in position 1
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (but we already know A is in position 3 from train)
- T is in the word but not in position 3
- C is in the word but not in position 4
- H is in the word but not in position 5

So:
- A is fixed at 3
- R is in word, not 1 or 2 (from arose and train), so R must be 4 or 5
- T is in word, not 1,2,3, so T must be 4 or 5
- C is in word, not 4, so C must be 1,2, or 5
- H is in word, not 5, so H must be 1,2, or 4

But positions 4 and 5 must contain both R and T, which is impossible unless one of them is in a different spot. This suggests the word must use R and T in positions 4 and 5 in some order, and C and H must be in positions 1 or 2.

Possible structure:
- Position 1: C or H
- Position 2: the other (H or C)
- Position 3: A
- Position 4: R or T
- Position 5: T or R

Let’s list possible words:
- CHART: C(1), H(2), A(3), R(4), T(5)
  - Check constraints:
    - A in 3: ✓
    - R not in 1,2,3: in 4 ✓
    - T not in 1,2,3: in 5 ✓
    - C not in 4: in 1 ✓
    - H not in 5: in 2 ✓
    - No forbidden letters (O,S,E,I,N) ✓
  - This seems valid.

Other possibilities like HCAT? don’t fit 5-letter words. CHART is valid.
