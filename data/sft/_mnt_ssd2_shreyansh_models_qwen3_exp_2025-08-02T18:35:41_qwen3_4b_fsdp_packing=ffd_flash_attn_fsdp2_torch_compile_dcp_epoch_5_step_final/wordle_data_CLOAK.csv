For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Some popular starting words include:
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid English word. This gives us the best chance of hitting multiple correct letters early in the game.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(✓): O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has O as its 3rd letter.
- The word contains A somewhere, but not in the 1st position.
- The word does NOT contain R, S, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with O in the 3rd position, contains A (but not in position 1), and avoids R, S, E.

Possible candidates:
- A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- O is fixed at position 3.
- We need two more letters that are not R, S, or E.

Let's think of words:
- A _ O _ _ (A in 1st is invalid)
- _ A O _ _
- _ _ O A _
- _ _ O _ A

Examples:
- ""PAINT"" – but has T and N, doesn't have A in correct spot.
- ""COAT"" – too short.
- ""MOATS"" – has S (invalid).
- ""FOCAL"" – has C, L, but A is in 4th (valid), O is 3rd (valid), no R/S/E.
- ""GOAL"" – too short.
- ""PLAID"" – has D, but A is 3rd (invalid, O must be 3rd).
- ""COBIA"" – has B, I, A, but O is 3rd (valid), A is 5th (valid), no R/S/E.

""COBIA"" seems valid:
- C, O, B, I, A
- O is 3rd (correct)
- A is 5th (not 1st, so valid)
- No R, S, E.

Another option: ""GOAL"" – too short.
Another: ""PAINT"" – no A in correct spot.
Another: ""FOCAL"" – A is 4th, O is 3rd, no R/S/E.

Between COBIA and FOCALE (but FOCALE is not a common word), COBIA seems better.

But let me check if COBIA is valid. Yes, COBIA is a valid 5-letter word (a type of fish).

However, let me think if there's a more common word. ""COBIA"" might be less common.

Alternative: ""GOOFY"" – has Y, but no A.
Alternative: ""PAINT"" – no A in correct spot.
Alternative: ""PLAID"" – A is 3rd (invalid, O must be 3rd).
Alternative: ""MOCHA"" – has C, H, A, but O is 3rd (valid), A is 5th (valid), no R/S/E.

""MOCHA"" seems good:
- M, O, C, H, A
- O is 3rd (correct)
- A is 5th (not 1st, so valid)
- No R, S, E.

But ""MOCHA"" has H, which might be less common letters. Let me think of another.

""GOOFY"" – no A.
""FOCAL"" – A is 4th, O is 3rd, no R/S/E.

""FOCAL"" seems good:
- F, O, C, A, L
- O is 3rd (correct)
- A is 4th (not 1st, so valid)
- No R, S, E.

This seems like the best option among common words.

But let me check if ""FOCAL"" is valid. Yes, ""FOCAL"" is a valid English word.

So the next guess is ""FOCAL"".

Based on the feedback:
- O is in the 3rd position.
- A is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- R, S, E are not in the word.

I'll guess a word that places O in the 3rd spot, includes A (not in 1st), and avoids R/S/E.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

Some popular starting words include:
- AROSE (uses A, R, O, S, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (uses A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly strong because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and is a valid English word. This gives us the best chance of hitting multiple correct letters early in the game.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(x): R is not in the word at all.
- O(✓): O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word has O as its 3rd letter.
- The word contains A somewhere, but not in the 1st position.
- The word does NOT contain R, S, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with O in the 3rd position, contains A (but not in position 1), and avoids R, S, E.

Possible candidates:
- A can be in positions 2, 4, or 5.
- O is fixed at position 3.
- We need two more letters that are not R, S, or E.

Let's think of words:
- A _ O _ _ (A in 1st is invalid)
- _ A O _ _
- _ _ O A _
- _ _ O _ A

Examples:
- ""PAINT"" – but has T and N, doesn't have A in correct spot.
- ""COAT"" – too short.
- ""MOATS"" – has S (invalid).
- ""FOCAL"" – has C, L, but A is in 4th (valid), O is 3rd (valid), no R/S/E.
- ""GOAL"" – too short.
- ""PLAID"" – has D, but A is 3rd (invalid, O must be 3rd).
- ""COBIA"" – has B, I, A, but O is 3rd (valid), A is 5th (valid), no R/S/E.

""COBIA"" seems valid:
- C, O, B, I, A
- O is 3rd (correct)
- A is 5th (not 1st, so valid)
- No R, S, E.

Another option: ""GOAL"" – too short.
Another: ""PAINT"" – no A in correct spot.
Another: ""FOCAL"" – A is 4th, O is 3rd, no R/S/E.

Between COBIA and FOCALE (but FOCALE is not a common word), COBIA seems better.

But let me check if COBIA is valid. Yes, COBIA is a valid 5-letter word (a type of fish).

However, let me think if there's a more common word. ""COBIA"" might be less common.

Alternative: ""GOOFY"" – has Y, but no A.
Alternative: ""PAINT"" – no A in correct spot.
Alternative: ""PLAID"" – A is 3rd (invalid, O must be 3rd).
Alternative: ""MOCHA"" – has C, H, A, but O is 3rd (valid), A is 5th (valid), no R/S/E.

""MOCHA"" seems good:
- M, O, C, H, A
- O is 3rd (correct)
- A is 5th (not 1st, so valid)
- No R, S, E.

But ""MOCHA"" has H, which might be less common letters. Let me think of another.

""GOOFY"" – no A.
""FOCAL"" – A is 4th, O is 3rd, no R/S/E.

""FOCAL"" seems good:
- F, O, C, A, L
- O is 3rd (correct)
- A is 4th (not 1st, so valid)
- No R, S, E.

This seems like the best option among common words.

But let me check if ""FOCAL"" is valid. Yes, ""FOCAL"" is a valid English word.

So the next guess is ""FOCAL"".Based on the feedback:
- O is in the 3rd position.
- A is in the word but not in the 1st position.
- R, S, E are not in the word.

I'll guess a word that places O in the 3rd spot, includes A (not in 1st), and avoids R/S/E.

   - O is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (but we already know it's 3rd, so consistent).
   - C is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position.
   - A is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).
   - L is in the word but NOT in the 5th position.

3. loach → L(-) O(-) A(-) C(-) H(x)
   - L is in the word but NOT in the 1st position.
   - O is in the word but NOT in the 2nd position (again consistent with 3rd).
   - A is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (but we know it's 4th, so consistent).
   - C is in the word but NOT in the 4th position (but we know it's not 3rd, so now it's not 3rd or 4th).
   - H is NOT in the word.

Current constraints:
- Pattern: _ _ O A _
- Letters known to be in the word: O (3rd), A (4th), C, L
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: R, S, E, F, H
- C cannot be in 3rd or 4th positions, so C must be in 1st or 2nd.
- L cannot be in 1st or 5th positions (from focal and loach feedback), so L must be in 2nd.

Therefore:
- 2nd letter must be L.
- C must be in 1st position (since 2nd is L and 3rd is O).
- 5th position is still unknown, must be a new letter not in the forbidden set.

So the pattern is: C L O A _

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with ""CLOA"". The only common word that fits is ""CLOAK"".

Check:
- C (1st) - allowed
- L (2nd) - allowed (only restriction was not 1st, but now we know it must be 2nd)
- O (3rd) - correct
- A (4th) - correct
- K - new letter, allowed
- Does not contain any forbidden letters (R,S,E,F,H)

This satisfies all constraints.
