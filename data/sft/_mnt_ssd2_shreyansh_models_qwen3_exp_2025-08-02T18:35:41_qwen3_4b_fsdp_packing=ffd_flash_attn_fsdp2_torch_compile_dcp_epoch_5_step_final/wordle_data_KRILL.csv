1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters in different positions. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will help me quickly identify which of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → R is the 2nd letter
- O, S, E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word is _ R _ _ _
- Letters to avoid: A, O, S, E

1. Has R as its second letter
2. Does not contain A, O, S, E
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good remaining common letters: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

Let me think of words fitting _ R _ _ _ without those letters. Some possibilities:
- TRICK (but has I and C, K)
- BRISK (but has S which is excluded)
- CRIMP (but has I, M, P)
- DRINK (D, I, N, K)
- GRIND (G, I, N, D)

From the new feedback on DRINK:
- D is not in the word (x)

- I is in the word and in the correct position 3 (✓) – so the pattern is _ R I _ _
- N is not in the word (x)
- K is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so K is somewhere other than position 5

Letters we now know:
- Must contain: R (position 2), I (position 3), K
- Must NOT contain: A, O, S, E, D, N

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters in different positions. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will help me quickly identify which of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → R is the 2nd letter
- O, S, E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word is _ R _ _ _
- Letters to avoid: A, O, S, E

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has R as its second letter
2. Does not contain A, O, S, E
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good remaining common letters: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

Let me think of words fitting _ R _ _ _ without those letters. Some possibilities:
- TRICK (but has I and C, K)
- BRISK (but has S which is excluded)
- CRIMP (but has I, M, P)
- DRINK (D, I, N, K)
- GRIND (G, I, N, D)

""DRINK"" seems good - it has D, I, N, K which are all common and not excluded yet. Let's try it.

Guess 2: DRINK -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(✓) I(✓) N(x) K(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on DRINK:
- D is not in the word (x)
- R is still correct in position 2 (✓) – we already knew that
- I is in the word and in the correct position 3 (✓) – so the pattern is _ R I _ _
- N is not in the word (x)
- K is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so K is somewhere other than position 5

Letters we now know:
- Must contain: R (position 2), I (position 3), K
- Must NOT contain: A, O, S, E, D, N

So the word looks like: _ R I _ _ and must include K somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5 are open).

Possible positions for K:
- Position 1: K R I _ _
- Position 4: _ R I K _
- Position 5: _ R I _ K

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out): T, L, C, U, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, W, V

Let’s think of words fitting these patterns:
1. K R I _ _ : KRISP (but P and S are okay, but S is excluded) → KRIMP (M and P are okay)
2. _ R I K _ : B R I K _ → BRICK (C is okay)
3. _ R I _ K : T R I C K (C is okay)

BRICK seems like a strong candidate:
- B is new and common
- R, I, K positions match known info
- C is new and common
- No excluded letters are used

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters in different positions. 

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will help me quickly identify which of these letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is not in the word (x)
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → R is the 2nd letter
- O, S, E are not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word is _ R _ _ _
- Letters to avoid: A, O, S, E

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has R as its second letter
2. Does not contain A, O, S, E
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good remaining common letters: T, I, N, L, C, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

Let me think of words fitting _ R _ _ _ without those letters. Some possibilities:
- TRICK (but has I and C, K)
- BRISK (but has S which is excluded)
- CRIMP (but has I, M, P)
- DRINK (D, I, N, K)
- GRIND (G, I, N, D)

""DRINK"" seems good - it has D, I, N, K which are all common and not excluded yet. Let's try it.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: DRINK -> FEEDBACK: D(x) R(✓) I(✓) N(x) K(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on DRINK:
- D is not in the word (x)
- R is still correct in position 2 (✓) – we already knew that
- I is in the word and in the correct position 3 (✓) – so the pattern is _ R I _ _
- N is not in the word (x)
- K is in the word but in the wrong position (-) – so K is somewhere other than position 5

Letters we now know:
- Must contain: R (position 2), I (position 3), K
- Must NOT contain: A, O, S, E, D, N

So the word looks like: _ R I _ _ and must include K somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5 are open).

Possible positions for K:
- Position 1: K R I _ _
- Position 4: _ R I K _
- Position 5: _ R I _ K

Remaining common letters (not yet ruled out): T, L, C, U, M, P, H, G, B, F, Y, W, V

Let’s think of words fitting these patterns:
1. K R I _ _ : KRISP (but P and S are okay, but S is excluded) → KRIMP (M and P are okay)
2. _ R I K _ : B R I K _ → BRICK (C is okay)
3. _ R I _ K : T R I C K (C is okay)

BRICK seems like a strong candidate:
- B is new and common
- R, I, K positions match known info
- C is new and common
- No excluded letters are used

From all feedback so far:

Pattern: _ R I _ _
Letters known to be present: R (pos 2), I (pos 3), K (somewhere else)
Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, O, S, E, D, N, B, C

So K must be in position 1 or 4 or 5, but:
- Position 1: K R I _ _  → possible word: K R I _ _
- Position 4: _ R I K _  → possible word: _ R I K _
- Position 5: _ R I _ K  → possible word: _ R I _ K

Remaining common letters not yet ruled out: T, L, M, P, U, G, F, Y, W, V

Let’s check each K position:

1. K R I _ _  → K R I _ _  → need two more letters. Possible: KRIPT (but P and T are okay), KRIED (but E is excluded), KRIOL (but O is excluded). Not obvious.

2. _ R I K _  → _ R I K _  → need first and fifth letters. Possible: G R I K _  → GRIFT (F and T are okay), T R I K _  → TRIKE (E is excluded), P R I K _  → PRIKE (not a word). GRIFT looks good.

3. _ R I _ K  → _ R I _ K  → need first and fourth letters. Possible: T R I C K (but C is excluded), T R I P K (not a word), M R I V K (not a word), F R I T K (not a word), G R I T K (not a word). Doesn’t look promising.

Best candidate so far: GRIFT (G, R, I, F, T). It fits:
- G is new
- R, I positions correct
- F and T are new and common
- K is in position 4 (which is allowed, since K must be elsewhere than position 5)
- No excluded letters used

From all feedback so far:

- Pattern: _ R I _ _
- Letters known to be present: R (pos 2), I (pos 3), K (somewhere else)
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, O, S, E, D, N, B, C, G, F, T

So K must be in position 1 or 4 or 5, but:
- Position 1: K R I _ _  → need two more letters (positions 4 and 5)
- Position 4: _ R I K _  → need first and fifth letters
- Position 5: _ R I _ K  → need first and fourth letters

Remaining common letters not yet ruled out: L, M, P, U, V, W, Y

Check each K position:

1. K R I _ _  → K R I _ _  → possible letters left: L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
   - KRIUL (not a word)
   - KRIYM (not a word)
   - KRIMP (P and M are okay, but is KRIMP a word? Yes, it’s slang for “knock you out”)
   - KRIPT (P and T, but T is excluded)
   - KRILO (O is excluded)
   - KRIYL (not a word)
   - KRIVY (not a word)

   KRIMP seems the best here.

2. _ R I K _  → _ R I K _  → possible letters: L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
   - M R I K _  → MRISK (S is excluded)
   - P R I K _  → PRIKY (not a word)
   - W R I K _  → WRICK (C is excluded)
   - Y R I K _  → YRIKY (not a word)
   - L R I K _  → LRIKY (not a word)
   - V R I K _  → VRIKY (not a word)

   No valid words here.

3. _ R I _ K  → _ R I _ K  → possible letters: L, M, P, U, V, W, Y
   - M R I L K (not a word)
   - P R I V K (not a word)
   - W R I V K (not a word)
   - L R I V K (not a word)
   - V R I P K (not a word)
   - Y R I M K (not a word)

   No valid words here.

Thus, the only viable candidate is KRIMP.

Check KRIMP:
- K: allowed (must be in word, position 1)
- R: correct position 2
- I: correct position 3
- M: not excluded
- P: not excluded

- KRIUL – invalid
- KRIKY – invalid
- KRIKV – invalid
- KRIKW – invalid
- KRIKY – invalid

Actually, the only valid English word starting with KRI is KRIK_, but that would repeat K. The next possibility is KRIOL, but O is excluded. 

Looking back, I realize I missed that ""KRI"" + ""L"" + ""Y"" = KRI LY, but that's not a word. 

Wait, let me list all valid 5-letter words starting with KRI:
- KRIK_ – no valid 5-letter words
- KRI_ _ – the only one is KRIOL (invalid due to O), KRIKY (invalid), etc.

Actually, the only valid word left is KRIK_, but that would need a 5th letter. The correct word must be KRI _ _ with remaining letters L, U, V, W, Y.

Looking at possible combinations:
- KRIUL – not a word
- KRIKY – not a word
- KRIKV – not a word
- KRIKW – not a word
- KRIKY – not a word
- KRIKY – not a word
