### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and provides good coverage of vowels and consonants. This will help narrow down possibilities for the secret word efficiently.

From the feedback so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
   – A, R, S are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 4 respectively.  
   – O, E are not in the word.

2. strap → S(✓) T(✓) R(✓) A(✓) P(x)  
   – S, T, R, A are all in the correct positions 1-4.  
   – P is not in the word.

3. straw → S(✓) T(✓) R(✓) A(✓) W(x)  
   – Confirms positions 1-4 are correct.  
   – W is not in the word.

So the secret word is STRA_ (first four letters S-T-R-A) and the fifth letter must be any letter that has not been ruled out.  
Letters already ruled out: O, E, P, W.  
Among common remaining consonants, Y is still possible (STRAY) and G is also possible (STRAG).  
Between these, STRAY is more common in standard word lists.

Therefore, the only plausible next guess is STRAY.
