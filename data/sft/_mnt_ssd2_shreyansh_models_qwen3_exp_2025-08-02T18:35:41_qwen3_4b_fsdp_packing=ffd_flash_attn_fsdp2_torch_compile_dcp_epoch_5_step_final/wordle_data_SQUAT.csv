### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which appear in many 5-letter words
- 2 common consonants (R, S) which are also very frequent
This gives me a good chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word early on, providing valuable information for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): A is in the word but not in the first position.

- O(x): O is not in the word at all.
- S(-): S is in the word but not in the fourth position.
- E(x): E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: A, S (but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively)

We need a 5-letter word that contains both A and S, does not contain R, O, or E, and places A and S in new positions.

Good consonants left: T, N, L, C, D, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A is already confirmed and E, O are out).

Let’s try a word that uses A and S in different positions and avoids the excluded letters. A common structure is to place S in position 2 or 3 and A elsewhere.

A good candidate is ""SAINT"":
- S is now in position 1 (new position).
- A is now in position 2 (new position).
- I and N are common letters not yet tested.
- T is a common consonant not yet tested.
- No R, O, or E are used.

This seems like a strong second guess to gather more information.

From the feedback so far:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
   - A is in the word, not in position 1.
   - S is in the word, not in position 4.
   - R, O, E are not in the word.

2. saunt → S(✓) A(-) U(✓) N(x) T(✓)
   - S is in the word and is in position 1 (✓).
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - U is in the word and is in position 3 (✓).
   - N is not in the word.
   - T is in the word and is in position 5 (✓).

So the word must be:
- S _ U _ T
- Contains A somewhere other than positions 1 or 2.
- Does not contain R, O, E, N.

Possible positions for A: 4 (since 1,2 are ruled out).

Thus the word must be S _ U A T.

The only common 5-letter word that fits this pattern is ""squats"" but Q is not yet ruled out, and we have no info on Q yet. However, we need to check if ""squats"" uses any excluded letters. It uses S, Q, U, A, T - none of R, O, E, N are present. But we have no info on Q yet, so it's possible.

Another possibility is ""spuat"" but that's not a valid word. ""stuat"" is also not valid. ""swuat"" isn't a word. ""shuat"" isn't a word. ""skuat"" isn't a word. ""sluat"" isn't a word.

Looking at valid words fitting S _ U A T:
- ""squats"" is valid but uses Q.
- ""stuat"" isn't valid.
- ""shuat"" isn't valid.
- ""spuat"" isn't valid.
- ""skuat"" isn't valid.

Actually, ""squats"" is the only valid word that fits S _ U A T. However, we have no information about Q yet, so it's possible. But let's think if there's another word.

Wait, maybe ""squad"" but that's S Q U A D, which would be S Q U A D, but we know T is in position 5, so that's invalid.

Actually, the pattern must be S _ U A T. The only valid word I can think of is ""squats"", but that's S Q U A T S, which is 6 letters. So that's invalid.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the pattern.

We have:
- Position 1: S (✓)
- Position 3: U (✓)
- Position 5: T (✓)
- A must be in the word, not in positions 1, 2, or 5 (since 5 is T). So A must be in position 4.

Thus the word must be S _ U A T.

Looking at valid 5-letter words:
- S H U A T → ""shuat"" - not valid.
- S C U A T → ""scuat"" - not valid.
- S L U A T → ""sluat"" - not valid.
- S W U A T → ""swuat"" - not valid.
- S P U A T → ""spuat"" - not valid.
- S K U A T → ""skuat"" - not valid.
- S Q U A T → ""squats"" - but that's 6 letters.
- S B U A T → ""sbuat"" - not valid.
- S D U A T → ""sduat"" - not valid.

Wait, the only valid word that fits S _ U A T is ""squats"" but that's 6 letters. So maybe I'm wrong.

Let me check again. Maybe A is not in position 4. The feedback says A is in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (from arose) and not in position 2 (from saunt). So A could be in positions 3, 4, or 5. But position 3 is U (from saunt), position 5 is T (from saunt), so A must be in position 4.

Thus the word must be S _ U A T. The only valid word I can think of is ""squats"" but that's 6 letters. This seems like a problem.

Wait, maybe ""squat"" is the word but that's 5 letters. Let me check:

""SQUAT"" - positions:
1: S (✓)
2: Q (unknown)
3: U (✓)
4: A (position 4, which is allowed)
5: T (✓)

This fits all constraints:
- Contains S, U, T in correct positions.
- Contains A in position 4 (not 1 or 2).
- Does not contain R, O, E, N.

Thus the word is ""squats"" but that's 5 letters: S Q U A T.

But ""squats"" is 6 letters. So this seems like a contradiction.

Wait, no, ""squats"" is 6 letters, but ""squat"" is 5 letters. So the word must be ""squat"".

But ""squat"" is S Q U A T, which fits:
- S(✓) position 1
- Q (not yet tested)
- U(✓) position 3
- A (must be in word, not in 1 or 2, so 4)
- T(✓) position 5

This seems to be the only valid word fitting all constraints.

Thus, the next guess should be ""squat"".
</think>

Based on the feedback:
- S is confirmed in position 1.
- U is confirmed in position 3.
- T is confirmed in position 5.
- A must be in the word but cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (since 1 and 5 are S and T respectively), so A must be in position 4.
- The word must be S _ U A T.

The only valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern is ""squat"".
