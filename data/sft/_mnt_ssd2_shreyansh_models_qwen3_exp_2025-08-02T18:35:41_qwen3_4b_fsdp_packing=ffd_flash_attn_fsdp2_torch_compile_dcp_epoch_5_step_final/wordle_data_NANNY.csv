For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - covers many vowels and common consonants.
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - similar idea.
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - also good.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers very common letters and can help me quickly identify vowels and common consonants.

- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.

- No R, O, S, E.
- Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, H, etc.
- Common remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already used, and O, E are out).

Let’s try a word that uses A in position 2 or 3, and introduces new common letters. ""PLAID"" is a good candidate:
- P, L, I, D are all new letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed since it’s not position 1).
- No R, O, S, E.

Another option is ""CABIN"":
- C, B, I, N are new.
- A is in position 2.
- No forbidden letters.

- A in position 2: _ A _ _ _
- Possible consonants: T, N, C, B, G, H, M, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.

A common word with A in position 2 is ""CABAL"" (but L is eliminated).
Another is ""GABBY"" (but B and Y are okay, but we’d need to check if B is allowed - it isn’t eliminated yet).
Actually, ""CABBY"" has B twice, but B isn’t eliminated.
But let’s look for a word with distinct new letters.

How about ""CANT""? No, it’s 4 letters.
""CHANT""? 5 letters, C, H, A, N, T - all new letters and A in position 3, but 3 is ruled out for A.
""CHANT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

""CHANT"" invalid.

""BATON"" - O is eliminated.
""BATTY"" - T and Y are okay, but A is in position 2 (valid), and B is okay.
""BATTY"" has B, A, T, T, Y - T is repeated, but that’s allowed.
But let’s look for a word with distinct letters.

""VATAN"" - A is in position 2 (valid), V, T, N are new letters, but N is repeated.
""VATAN"" is okay, but might not be common.

""CANAL"" - O is eliminated (no O), but A is in position 2 (valid), C, N, L - L is eliminated.
""CANAL"" invalid.

""GANJA"" - A is in position 2 (valid), G, N, J are new letters, but J is less common.

- B A _ _ _ : ""BANAL"" (L eliminated), ""BANJO"" (O eliminated).
- T A _ _ _ : ""TAMAN"" (not common), ""TAPIR"" (R eliminated).
- N A _ _ _ : ""NABOB"" (O eliminated), ""NAPAL"" (L eliminated).

Possible words:

- B _ _ A _ : ""BAGAN"" (G, N are new), but ""BAGAN"" is a place name.
- T _ _ A _ : ""TAWNY"" (W, N, Y are new), A in position 4.
- N _ _ A _ : ""NUTTY"" (U, T, Y are new), A in position 4.

- B _ _ A _ : ""BANAL"" (L eliminated), ""BANJO"" (O eliminated).
- T _ _ A _ : ""TAWNY"" is valid.

""TAWNY"" seems like a good candidate:
- T, A, W, N, Y - all letters are not eliminated.
- A is in position 4 (valid).
- It’s a common word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - covers many vowels and common consonants.
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - similar idea.
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - also good.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers very common letters and can help me quickly identify vowels and common consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains an A, but not in position 1.
2. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A somewhere except the first position.
- No R, O, S, E.
- Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, H, etc.
- Common remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already used, and O, E are out).

Let’s try a word that uses A in position 2 or 3, and introduces new common letters. ""PLAID"" is a good candidate:
- P, L, I, D are all new letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed since it’s not position 1).
- No R, O, S, E.

Another option is ""CABIN"":
- C, B, I, N are new.
- A is in position 2.
- No forbidden letters.

I’ll go with ""PLAID"" as it uses four new consonants and the known A in a new position.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: PLAID -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. PLAID → P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)
   - P, L, I, D are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (it was in position 3 here).

So far we know:
- The word contains A, and A is not in positions 1 or 3.
- The word does NOT contain: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D.

Remaining common consonants: T, N, C, B, G, H, M, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (A is already known to be present).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2 or 4 (since 1 and 3 are ruled out).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Let’s try to place A in position 2 and build a word with new consonants:
- A in position 2: _ A _ _ _
- Possible consonants: T, N, C, B, G, H, M, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.

A common word with A in position 2 is ""CABAL"" (but L is eliminated).
Another is ""GABBY"" (but B and Y are okay, but we’d need to check if B is allowed - it isn’t eliminated yet).
Actually, ""CABBY"" has B twice, but B isn’t eliminated.
But let’s look for a word with distinct new letters.

How about ""CANT""? No, it’s 4 letters.
""CHANT""? 5 letters, C, H, A, N, T - all new letters and A in position 3, but 3 is ruled out for A.
""CHANT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

Next, place A in position 4:
- _ _ _ A _
Possible consonants: T, N, C, B, G, H, M, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.

A good candidate is ""MOUNT"" - but O is eliminated.
""COUNT"" - O is eliminated.
""CHANT"" - already considered.
""CHANT"" invalid.

""BATON"" - O is eliminated.
""BATTY"" - T and Y are okay, but A is in position 2 (valid), and B is okay.
""BATTY"" has B, A, T, T, Y - T is repeated, but that’s allowed.
But let’s look for a word with distinct letters.

""VATAN"" - A is in position 2 (valid), V, T, N are new letters, but N is repeated.
""VATAN"" is okay, but might not be common.

""CANAL"" - O is eliminated (no O), but A is in position 2 (valid), C, N, L - L is eliminated.
""CANAL"" invalid.

""GANJA"" - A is in position 2 (valid), G, N, J are new letters, but J is less common.
""GANJA"" is okay, but might not be the best.

""CHANT"" is invalid as A is in position 3.
""CHANT"" is invalid.

Let’s try ""CHANT"" - no, A is in position 3.

""CHANT"" invalid.

""CHANT"" invalid.

Let’s try ""CHANT"" - no.

Wait, let’s list possible positions for A:
A can be in position 2 or 4.

For position 2:
_ A _ _ _
Letters allowed: any except R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D.

Possible words:
- C A _ _ _ : ""CABBY"" (B twice), ""CANTY"" (but T and Y are okay, but ""CANTY"" isn’t a word).
- B A _ _ _ : ""BANAL"" (L eliminated), ""BANJO"" (O eliminated).
- T A _ _ _ : ""TAMAN"" (not common), ""TAPIR"" (R eliminated).
- N A _ _ _ : ""NABOB"" (O eliminated), ""NAPAL"" (L eliminated).
- H A _ _ _ : ""HABIT"" (I eliminated), ""HANGS"" (S eliminated).

For position 4:
_ _ _ A _
Letters allowed: any except R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D.

Possible words:
- C _ _ A _ : ""CABAL"" (L eliminated), ""CAGAS"" (S eliminated).
- B _ _ A _ : ""BAGAN"" (G, N are new), but ""BAGAN"" is a place name.
- T _ _ A _ : ""TAWNY"" (W, N, Y are new), A in position 4.
- N _ _ A _ : ""NUTTY"" (U, T, Y are new), A in position 4.
- C _ _ A _ : ""CHART"" (R eliminated), ""CHANT"" (A in position 3), ""CHATS"" (S eliminated).
- B _ _ A _ : ""BANAL"" (L eliminated), ""BANJO"" (O eliminated).
- T _ _ A _ : ""TAWNY"" is valid.

""TAWNY"" seems like a good candidate:
- T, A, W, N, Y - all letters are not eliminated.
- A is in position 4 (valid).
- It’s a common word.

Let’s check:
T - not eliminated
A - known to be in word, position 4 is allowed
W - not eliminated
N - not eliminated
Y - not eliminated

Yes, ""TAWNY"" fits all constraints.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - covers many vowels and common consonants.
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - similar idea.
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - also good.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers very common letters and can help me quickly identify vowels and common consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains an A, but not in position 1.
2. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A somewhere except the first position.
- No R, O, S, E.
- Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, H, etc.
- Common remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already used, and O, E are out).

Let’s try a word that uses A in position 2 or 3, and introduces new common letters. ""PLAID"" is a good candidate:
- P, L, I, D are all new letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed since it’s not position 1).
- No R, O, S, E.

Another option is ""CABIN"":
- C, B, I, N are new.
- A is in position 2.
- No forbidden letters.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAID -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. PLAID → P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)
   - P, L, I, D are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (it was in position 3 here).

So far we know:
- The word contains A, and A is not in positions 1 or 3.
- The word does NOT contain: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D.

Remaining common consonants: T, N, C, B, G, H, M, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (A is already known to be present).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2 or 4 (since 1 and 3 are ruled out).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Let’s try to place A in position 2 and build a word with new consonants:
- A in position 2: _ A _ _ _
- Possible consonants: T, N, C, B, G, H, M, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.

A common word with A in position 2 is ""CABAL"" (but L is eliminated).
Another is ""GABBY"" (but B and Y are okay, but we’d need to check if B is allowed - it isn’t eliminated yet).
Actually, ""CABBY"" has B twice, but B isn’t eliminated.
But let’s look for a word with distinct new letters.

How about ""CANT""? No, it’s 4 letters.
""CHANT""? 5 letters, C, H, A, N, T - all new letters and A in position 3, but 3 is ruled out for A.
""CHANT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

Next, place A in position 4:
- _ _ _ A _
Possible consonants: T, N, C, B, G, H, M, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.

A good candidate is ""MOUNT"" - but O is eliminated.
""COUNT"" - O is eliminated.
""CHANT"" - already considered.
""CHANT"" invalid.

""BATON"" - O is eliminated.
""BATTY"" - T and Y are okay, but A is in position 2 (valid), and B is okay.
""BATTY"" has B, A, T, T, Y - T is repeated, but that’s allowed.
But let’s look for a word with distinct letters.

""VATAN"" - A is in position 2 (valid), V, T, N are new letters, but N is repeated.
""VATAN"" is okay, but might not be common.

""CANAL"" - O is eliminated (no O), but A is in position 2 (valid), C, N, L - L is eliminated.
""CANAL"" invalid.

""GANJA"" - A is in position 2 (valid), G, N, J are new letters, but J is less common.
""GANJA"" is okay, but might not be the best.

""CHANT"" is invalid as A is in position 3.
""CHANT"" is invalid.

Let’s try ""CHANT"" - no, A is in position 3.

""CHANT"" invalid.

""CHANT"" invalid.

Let’s try ""CHANT"" - no.

Wait, let’s list possible positions for A:
A can be in position 2 or 4.

For position 2:
_ A _ _ _
Letters allowed: any except R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D.

Possible words:
- C A _ _ _ : ""CABBY"" (B twice), ""CANTY"" (but T and Y are okay, but ""CANTY"" isn’t a word).
- B A _ _ _ : ""BANAL"" (L eliminated), ""BANJO"" (O eliminated).
- T A _ _ _ : ""TAMAN"" (not common), ""TAPIR"" (R eliminated).
- N A _ _ _ : ""NABOB"" (O eliminated), ""NAPAL"" (L eliminated).
- H A _ _ _ : ""HABIT"" (I eliminated), ""HANGS"" (S eliminated).

For position 4:
_ _ _ A _
Letters allowed: any except R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D.

Possible words:
- C _ _ A _ : ""CABAL"" (L eliminated), ""CAGAS"" (S eliminated).
- B _ _ A _ : ""BAGAN"" (G, N are new), but ""BAGAN"" is a place name.
- T _ _ A _ : ""TAWNY"" (W, N, Y are new), A in position 4.
- N _ _ A _ : ""NUTTY"" (U, T, Y are new), A in position 4.
- C _ _ A _ : ""CHART"" (R eliminated), ""CHANT"" (A in position 3), ""CHATS"" (S eliminated).
- B _ _ A _ : ""BANAL"" (L eliminated), ""BANJO"" (O eliminated).
- T _ _ A _ : ""TAWNY"" is valid.

""TAWNY"" seems like a good candidate:
- T, A, W, N, Y - all letters are not eliminated.
- A is in position 4 (valid).
- It’s a common word.

Let’s check:
T - not eliminated
A - known to be in word, position 4 is allowed
W - not eliminated
N - not eliminated
Y - not eliminated

Yes, ""TAWNY"" fits all constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)

Guess 3: TAWNY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) W(x) N(✓) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>

From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are absent.

2. PLAID → P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)
   - P, L, I, D are absent.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

3. TAWNY → T(x) A(✓) W(x) N(✓) Y(✓)
   - T, W are absent.
   - A is in position 2 (✓).
   - N is in position 4 (✓).
   - Y is in position 5 (✓).

So the secret word is of the form: _ A _ N Y
with the additional constraints:
- Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D, T, W.
- Remaining letters that can appear anywhere: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Z (and A, N, Y are already placed).

We need a 5-letter word that starts with any allowed consonant, has A in position 2, N in position 4, and Y in position 5.

Possible first letters (consonants not yet eliminated): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Z.

Possible third letters (positions 3): any remaining letters except the already eliminated ones.

Let’s list possible words fitting the pattern _ A _ N Y:

- B A _ N Y: BANAL (L eliminated), BANJO (O eliminated), BANNY (valid word, N repeated but allowed), BANJO (invalid), BAGNY (not a word).
- C A _ N Y: CANAL (L eliminated), CANON (O eliminated), CANNY (valid word).
- F A _ N Y: FANNY (valid word).
- G A _ N Y: GANNY (not a word), GABNY (not a word).
- H A _ N Y: HANNY (not common), HABNY (not a word).
- J A _ N Y: JANNY (not a word).
- K A _ N Y: KANNY (not a word).
- M A _ N Y: MANNY (valid word).
- Q A _ N Y: QANNY (not a word).
- V A _ N Y: VANNY (valid word).
- X A _ N Y: XANNY (not a word).
- Z A _ N Y: ZANNY (not a word).

Valid words found:
- CANNY
- FANNY
- MANNY
- VANNY

Among these, ""CANNY"" is the most common word, so let’s try it.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular choices include ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Looking at these options:
- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E - covers many vowels and common consonants.
- ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E - similar idea.
- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E - also good.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it covers very common letters and can help me quickly identify vowels and common consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → the letter A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R(x) → R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. The word contains an A, but not in position 1.
2. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, or E.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A somewhere except the first position.
- No R, O, S, E.
- Common remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, H, etc.
- Common remaining vowels: I, U (since A is already used, and O, E are out).

Let’s try a word that uses A in position 2 or 3, and introduces new common letters. ""PLAID"" is a good candidate:
- P, L, I, D are all new letters.
- A is in position 2 (allowed since it’s not position 1).
- No R, O, S, E.

Another option is ""CABIN"":
- C, B, I, N are new.
- A is in position 2.
- No forbidden letters.

I’ll go with ""PLAID"" as it uses four new consonants and the known A in a new position.

   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

2. PLAID → P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)
   - P, L, I, D are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (it was in position 3 here).

So far we know:
- The word contains A, and A is not in positions 1 or 3.
- The word does NOT contain: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D.

Remaining common consonants: T, N, C, B, G, H, M, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: U (A is already known to be present).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2 or 4 (since 1 and 3 are ruled out).
- Uses only letters not yet eliminated.

Let’s try to place A in position 2 and build a word with new consonants:
- A in position 2: _ A _ _ _
- Possible consonants: T, N, C, B, G, H, M, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.

A common word with A in position 2 is ""CABAL"" (but L is eliminated).
Another is ""GABBY"" (but B and Y are okay, but we’d need to check if B is allowed - it isn’t eliminated yet).
Actually, ""CABBY"" has B twice, but B isn’t eliminated.
But let’s look for a word with distinct new letters.

How about ""CANT""? No, it’s 4 letters.
""CHANT""? 5 letters, C, H, A, N, T - all new letters and A in position 3, but 3 is ruled out for A.
""CHANT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

Next, place A in position 4:
- _ _ _ A _
Possible consonants: T, N, C, B, G, H, M, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.

A good candidate is ""MOUNT"" - but O is eliminated.
""COUNT"" - O is eliminated.
""CHANT"" - already considered.
""CHANT"" invalid.

""BATON"" - O is eliminated.
""BATTY"" - T and Y are okay, but A is in position 2 (valid), and B is okay.
""BATTY"" has B, A, T, T, Y - T is repeated, but that’s allowed.
But let’s look for a word with distinct letters.

""VATAN"" - A is in position 2 (valid), V, T, N are new letters, but N is repeated.
""VATAN"" is okay, but might not be common.

""CANAL"" - O is eliminated (no O), but A is in position 2 (valid), C, N, L - L is eliminated.
""CANAL"" invalid.

""GANJA"" - A is in position 2 (valid), G, N, J are new letters, but J is less common.
""GANJA"" is okay, but might not be the best.

""CHANT"" is invalid as A is in position 3.
""CHANT"" is invalid.

Let’s try ""CHANT"" - no, A is in position 3.

""CHANT"" invalid.

""CHANT"" invalid.

Let’s try ""CHANT"" - no.

Wait, let’s list possible positions for A:
A can be in position 2 or 4.

For position 2:
_ A _ _ _
Letters allowed: any except R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D.

Possible words:
- C A _ _ _ : ""CABBY"" (B twice), ""CANTY"" (but T and Y are okay, but ""CANTY"" isn’t a word).
- B A _ _ _ : ""BANAL"" (L eliminated), ""BANJO"" (O eliminated).
- T A _ _ _ : ""TAMAN"" (not common), ""TAPIR"" (R eliminated).
- N A _ _ _ : ""NABOB"" (O eliminated), ""NAPAL"" (L eliminated).
- H A _ _ _ : ""HABIT"" (I eliminated), ""HANGS"" (S eliminated).

For position 4:
_ _ _ A _
Letters allowed: any except R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D.

Possible words:
- C _ _ A _ : ""CABAL"" (L eliminated), ""CAGAS"" (S eliminated).
- B _ _ A _ : ""BAGAN"" (G, N are new), but ""BAGAN"" is a place name.
- T _ _ A _ : ""TAWNY"" (W, N, Y are new), A in position 4.
- N _ _ A _ : ""NUTTY"" (U, T, Y are new), A in position 4.
- C _ _ A _ : ""CHART"" (R eliminated), ""CHANT"" (A in position 3), ""CHATS"" (S eliminated).
- B _ _ A _ : ""BANAL"" (L eliminated), ""BANJO"" (O eliminated).
- T _ _ A _ : ""TAWNY"" is valid.

""TAWNY"" seems like a good candidate:
- T, A, W, N, Y - all letters are not eliminated.
- A is in position 4 (valid).
- It’s a common word.

Let’s check:
T - not eliminated
A - known to be in word, position 4 is allowed
W - not eliminated
N - not eliminated
Y - not eliminated

Yes, ""TAWNY"" fits all constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAID -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)
Guess 3: TAWNY -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(✓) W(x) N(✓) Y(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are absent.

2. PLAID → P(x) L(x) A(-) I(x) D(x)
   - P, L, I, D are absent.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

3. TAWNY → T(x) A(✓) W(x) N(✓) Y(✓)
   - T, W are absent.
   - A is in position 2 (✓).
   - N is in position 4 (✓).
   - Y is in position 5 (✓).

So the secret word is of the form: _ A _ N Y
with the additional constraints:
- Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, E, P, L, I, D, T, W.
- Remaining letters that can appear anywhere: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Z (and A, N, Y are already placed).

We need a 5-letter word that starts with any allowed consonant, has A in position 2, N in position 4, and Y in position 5.

Possible first letters (consonants not yet eliminated): B, C, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, V, X, Z.

Possible third letters (positions 3): any remaining letters except the already eliminated ones.

Let’s list possible words fitting the pattern _ A _ N Y:

- B A _ N Y: BANAL (L eliminated), BANJO (O eliminated), BANNY (valid word, N repeated but allowed), BANJO (invalid), BAGNY (not a word).
- C A _ N Y: CANAL (L eliminated), CANON (O eliminated), CANNY (valid word).
- F A _ N Y: FANNY (valid word).
- G A _ N Y: GANNY (not a word), GABNY (not a word).
- H A _ N Y: HANNY (not common), HABNY (not a word).
- J A _ N Y: JANNY (not a word).
- K A _ N Y: KANNY (not a word).
- M A _ N Y: MANNY (valid word).
- Q A _ N Y: QANNY (not a word).
- V A _ N Y: VANNY (valid word).
- X A _ N Y: XANNY (not a word).
- Z A _ N Y: ZANNY (not a word).

Valid words found:
- CANNY
- FANNY
- MANNY
- VANNY

Among these, ""CANNY"" is the most common word, so let’s try it.
