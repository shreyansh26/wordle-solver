### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word often includes common letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

Looking at the most common letters in English words, ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English

This should give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

- Ends with R (position 5 = R)
- Contains A, E, L somewhere in positions 1-4
- Does NOT contain O, S, T, D, C
- Uses only remaining common letters (N, H, G, etc. if needed)

Let’s try to construct a valid word:

We know:
- Position 5 = R
- We need A, E, L in positions 1-4
- We need one more letter (since we have 4 letters already: A, E, L, R)

Possible remaining letters (common ones not yet used): N, H, G, B, M, etc.

- R: position 5 (fixed)

Check letters: B, A, L, E, R – all allowed so far.  
No forbidden letters (O, S, T, D, C) are used.

This seems like a good next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A good starting word often includes common letters like A, E, R, S, T, L, N, etc. 

Looking at the most common letters in English words, ""AROSE"" is a popular choice because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are among the top 10 most frequent in English

This should give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x): O is NOT in the word
- S(x): S is NOT in the word
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, E
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S
- We need to place A, R, E in new positions, and introduce new letters.

A good next guess should:
1. Re-use A, R, E in different positions
2. Introduce new common letters not yet tried (T, N, L, etc.)
3. Avoid O and S

Let's try ""TREAD"":
- T: new letter
- R: move from position 2 to 3
- E: move from position 5 to 2
- A: move from position 1 to 4
- D: new letter

This re-uses A, R, E while introducing T and D, and avoids O and S.

From arose:

- R is not in position 2 (from arose) and not in position 3 (from tread)  
- E is not in position 3 (from tread) and not in position 5 (from arose)  
- A is not in position 1 (from arose) and not in position 4 (from tread)

So positions we know:
- A cannot be in 1 or 4 → must be in 2, 3, or 5
- R cannot be in 2 or 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5
- E cannot be in 3 or 5 → must be in 1, 2, or 4

We need to place A, R, E in the remaining positions while introducing new letters (common ones left: N, L, C, H, etc.).

Let's try ""CLEAR"":
- C: new letter
- L: new letter
- E: move to position 2
- A: move to position 3
- R: move to position 5

This places:
- E in 2 (allowed)
- A in 3 (allowed)
- R in 5 (allowed)
- Introduces C and L which haven't been tested yet.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: A, R, E
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: O, S
- We need to place A, R, E in new positions, and introduce new letters.

A good next guess should:
1. Re-use A, R, E in different positions
2. Introduce new common letters not yet tried (T, N, L, etc.)
3. Avoid O and S

Let's try ""TREAD"":
- T: new letter
- R: move from position 2 to 3
- E: move from position 5 to 2
- A: move from position 1 to 4
- D: new letter

This re-uses A, R, E while introducing T and D, and avoids O and S.

Let's update what we know after both guesses.

From arose:  
A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
Letters in word: A, R, E  
Letters out: O, S  

From tread:  
T(x) R(-) E(-) A(-) D(x)  
Letters in word: still A, R, E  
Letters out: T, D, plus we now know:  
- R is not in position 2 (from arose) and not in position 3 (from tread)  
- E is not in position 3 (from tread) and not in position 5 (from arose)  
- A is not in position 1 (from arose) and not in position 4 (from tread)

So positions we know:
- A cannot be in 1 or 4 → must be in 2, 3, or 5
- R cannot be in 2 or 3 → must be in 1, 4, or 5
- E cannot be in 3 or 5 → must be in 1, 2, or 4

We need to place A, R, E in the remaining positions while introducing new letters (common ones left: N, L, C, H, etc.).

Let's try ""CLEAR"":
- C: new letter
- L: new letter
- E: move to position 2
- A: move to position 3
- R: move to position 5

This places:
- E in 2 (allowed)
- A in 3 (allowed)
- R in 5 (allowed)
- Introduces C and L which haven't been tested yet.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tread -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) E(-) A(-) D(x)
Guess 3: clear -> FEEDBACK: C(x) L(-) E(-) A(-) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on CLEAR:

C(x) – C is NOT in the word.  
L(-) – L is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
A(-) – A is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
R(✓) – R is in the word AND in position 5.

Summary of everything we now know:

Letters in the word: A, R, E, L  
Letters out: O, S, T, D, C  

Positions:
- R is fixed in position 5.
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 4 → must be in 2 or 3.
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5 → must be in 1, 2, or 4.
- L is in the word but not in position 2.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with R (position 5 = R)
- Contains A, E, L somewhere in positions 1-4
- Does NOT contain O, S, T, D, C
- Uses only remaining common letters (N, H, G, etc. if needed)

Let’s try to construct a valid word:

We know:
- Position 5 = R
- We need A, E, L in positions 1-4
- We need one more letter (since we have 4 letters already: A, E, L, R)

Possible remaining letters (common ones not yet used): N, H, G, B, M, etc.

Let’s try “BALER”:
- B: new letter
- A: position 2 (allowed)
- L: position 3 (allowed, since L just can’t be in 2)
- E: position 4 (allowed, since E just can’t be in 3 or 5)
- R: position 5 (fixed)

Check letters: B, A, L, E, R – all allowed so far.  
No forbidden letters (O, S, T, D, C) are used.

This seems like a good next guess.

We now know:

Letters in the word: A, L, E, R  
Letters out: O, S, T, D, C, B  

Positions:
- Position 1: must be L or E (A and R are already placed in positions 2 and 5 respectively, and E cannot be in position 3 or 5, so E can only be in 1 or 4)
- Position 2: A (fixed from baler feedback)
- Position 3: must be L (because L is in the word and cannot be in position 2, and all other positions are taken by A, E, R)
- Position 4: must be E (only remaining possibility)
- Position 5: R (fixed)

So the word must be: _ A L E R

The only common 5-letter word that fits is ""FALER"" but that's not valid. The correct word is ""FALER"" doesn't exist, but ""GALER"" doesn't exist either. Wait, let me think differently.

Actually, the pattern is _ A L E R. The only valid word I can think of is ""HALER"" (a unit of currency). Let me check if H is allowed. H hasn't been used yet and isn't in the banned list. So ""HALER"" is possible.

But let me double-check:
- H: new letter
- A: position 2 (✓)
- L: position 3 (allowed, since L can't be in 2)
- E: position 4 (allowed, since E can't be in 3 or 5)
- R: position 5 (✓)

""HALER"" seems to fit all constraints.

We now know the exact positions of four letters:

We also know the word must contain L, but L is NOT in position 3 (from baler feedback: L(-) in position 3 means L is in the word but not there).  
Since positions 2, 4, 5 are taken by A, E, R, the only remaining slots are 1 and 3.  
L must go into either 1 or 3, but cannot be in 3 (from baler), so L must be in position 1.
