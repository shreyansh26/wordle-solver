For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S, L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- No repeated letters
This should give me good coverage of frequently used letters in 5-letter words.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are all absent (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5).

Since S, L, T, E are ruled out, I need a new word that:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)

2. CRANK → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) K(x)
   - Letters ruled out: C, R, N, K
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (again) and also not in position 3 here, so we now know A is not in position 3 or 4.

So far:
- A must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
- Ruled-out letters: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K.
- Remaining common letters to test: D, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, I, O, U, B, F, etc.

We need a word that:
- Contains A in position 1, 2, or 5.
- Uses only the remaining letters.
- Uses new common letters to maximize information.

Good candidates:
- If A is in position 1: A _ _ _ _
  - ADOPT uses D, O, P, T (but T is ruled out).
  - ADORE uses D, O, R (R is ruled out).
  - AGING uses G, I, N (N is ruled out).
  - AMBIT uses M, B, I, T (T ruled out).
  - AMISS uses M, I, S (S ruled out).
  - AMPLY uses M, P, L (L ruled out).
  - ANGEL uses N, G, E, L (N and E and L ruled out).
  - APHID uses P, H, I, D.
  - APHYS uses P, H, Y, S (S ruled out).
  - APYURS (not a valid word).

- If A is in position 2: _ A _ _ _
  - BAGGY uses B, G, Y.
  - DAILY uses D, I, L (L ruled out).
  - GAMER uses G, M, E (E ruled out).
  - GUMMY uses G, M, Y.
  - HABIT uses H, B, I, T (T ruled out).
  - MAMBA uses M, B.
  - PAPAW uses P, P, W (double P, W is fine).
  - PAVLOP (not common).
  - VAPOR uses V, O, R (R ruled out).
  - VAPID uses V, I, D.

- If A is in position 5: _ _ _ _ A
  - BOUND uses B, O, U, N (N ruled out).
  - DOUBT uses D, O, U, T (T ruled out).
  - GUMMY ends with Y, not A.
  - HUMID uses H, U, M, I, D.
  - MUDRA uses M, U, D, R (R ruled out).
  - PUDGY uses P, U, D, G, Y.

The best options seem to be:
- HABIT (but T is ruled out)
- GAMER (E ruled out)
- BAGGY (good letters B, G, Y)
- GUMMY (good letters G, M, M, Y)
- HUMID (H, U, M, I, D)

HUMID uses 5 new letters (H, U, M, I, D) and places A in position 5, which we haven't tested yet for A. However, HUMID does not contain A, so this is invalid.

Looking back, we need a word with A in 1, 2, or 5 positions, using only allowed letters.

Best fit:
- BAGGY: B, A, G, G, Y. Contains A in position 2. Uses B, G, Y (all new). Valid.

Another option:
- GAMMA: G, A, M, M, A. Contains A in positions 2 and 5. Uses G, M (new letters). Valid, but has double M.

Between BAGGY and GAMMA, BAGGY seems better for information.

But let's check if BAGGY is valid: yes, it's a common word.

Therefore, I'll choose BAGGY as it tests B, G, Y while placing A in position 2.

From the new feedback on BAGGY:

So far we know:
- A is fixed in position 2.
- Ruled-out letters: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K, B, G, Y.
- Remaining letters to try: D, H, I, M, O, P, U, V, W, F, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2.
- No S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K, B, G, Y.
- Uses other remaining letters.

Good candidates:
- _ A _ _ _ with allowed letters.
- Possible consonants: D, H, M, P, V, W, F.
- Possible vowels: I, O, U.

Let's think of words:
- D A _ _ _ : DAILY (L ruled out), DAMN (too short), DAWNS (S ruled out), DAWNY (Y ruled out), DAWNS invalid.
- H A _ _ _ : HAMMY (M,Y but Y ruled out), HAPLY (Y ruled out), HAVOC (O,C ruled out), HASTY (S,Y ruled out), HABIT (B ruled out), HUMID (doesn't have A), HUMOR (O,R ruled out), HUMID (no A), HUMPH (H,P,F), HUMPY (Y ruled out).
- M A _ _ _ : MADAM (D,M), but D is allowed, M is allowed, but A is in position 2, so MADAM: M A D A M. This uses M, A, D, M. But A is already fixed in position 2, and the word would have A in position 4 as well, which is fine. However, MADAM uses D (allowed) and M (allowed), and no ruled-out letters.
- P A _ _ _ : PAPAW (W allowed), but has double P.
- V A _ _ _ : VAPID (I,D allowed), but D is allowed, I is allowed.
- W A _ _ _ : WAMBY (Y ruled out), WANDY (Y ruled out), WAMPS (S ruled out), WAMMY (Y ruled out), WAFER (E ruled out), WAFUL (F,U allowed), but F and U are allowed, but WAFUL is less common.
- F A _ _ _ : FANCY (C,Y ruled out), FABLE (E,B ruled out), FADGE (G,E ruled out), FADIS (S ruled out), FADLY (Y ruled out), FADOM (O,M allowed), but FADOM is obscure.

MADAM seems the best option: uses M, A, D, M. It has A in position 2 (confirmed), and uses D and M which are new letters. It also avoids all ruled-out letters.

Another option: VAPID (V,A,P,I,D) - all letters allowed and new.
But MADAM is more common and uses M and D.

Between MADAM and VAPID, MADAM seems better.

But let's check MADAM: M A D A M. This has A in position 2 and 4. Since we only know A is in position 2, position 4 could be A or another letter. However, the feedback doesn't say anything about other positions except position 2 for A. So MADAM is acceptable.

But VAPID is also valid: V A P I D. All letters are new.

Between these, VAPID introduces more new letters (V,P,I,D) compared to MADAM (M,D). So VAPID is better for information.

Therefore, the next guess should be VAPID.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S, L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- No repeated letters
This should give me good coverage of frequently used letters in 5-letter words.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are all absent (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5).

Since S, L, T, E are ruled out, I need a new word that:
1. Contains A (and not in position 3).
2. Uses other common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoids S, L, T, E entirely.

Good remaining consonants to test: R, N, C, D, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A strong next guess should use A in a new position and introduce several new common letters. “CRANK” is a good choice because:
- C, R, N, K are all new letters.
- A is moved to position 2 (was position 3 before).
- It’s a common word and uses frequently occurring letters.

But let's check MADAM: M A D A M. This has A in position 2 and 4. Since we only know A is in position 2, position 4 could be A or another letter. However, the feedback doesn't say anything about other positions except position 2 for A. So MADAM is acceptable.

But VAPID is also valid: V A P I D. All letters are new.

Between these, VAPID introduces more new letters (V,P,I,D) compared to MADAM (M,D). So VAPID is better for information.

Therefore, the next guess should be VAPID.

From the feedback so far:

1. A is fixed in position 2 (✓).
2. I is in the word but not in position 4 (✓).
3. Ruled-out letters: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K, B, G, Y, V, P, D.

So the word has the pattern: _ A _ _ _ with:
- I somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5 (since it’s not in 4).
- Allowed letters left: F, H, J, M, O, Q, U, W, X, Z (plus any others not yet ruled out).

Possible consonants: F, H, J, M, O (sometimes vowel), Q, U, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word matching _ A _ _ _ that uses I in 1, 3, or 5 and only allowed letters.

Let’s list possibilities:

- I A _ _ _ : IA is not a common start, and remaining letters must fit. IA is rare in English.
- _ A I _ _ : Third letter I.
- _ A _ _ I : Fifth letter I.

Looking for common words:

- _ A I _ _ : MAJOR (but J is allowed, O is allowed, R is ruled out), MAJOR invalid.
- _ A _ _ I : MAMMA (M,M), but M is allowed, but double M and A already fixed. MAMMA: M A M M A – but A is only confirmed in position 2, so this has A in 2 and 5, which is fine, but M is allowed. However, MAMMA uses M twice and A twice, which might not be optimal.
- _ A _ _ I : FAMAS (S ruled out), HAMAL (L ruled out), JAMMY (Y ruled out), MAMMA (already considered), WAMBI (B ruled out), WAMMY (Y ruled out).
- _ A I _ _ : MAMIA (A already in 2), MAJOR (R ruled out), MIAOU (O allowed, but uncommon), MIAOW (O allowed, but uncommon), MIAOU, MIAOW are obscure.
- _ A _ I _ : MAJOR (R ruled out), MAFIA (F allowed, A already in 2, but F is allowed, I allowed, A already in 2, but this would be M A F I A – but A is only in position 2 confirmed, so this has A in 2 and 5, which is fine. MAFIA uses F, A, F, I, A – but F is allowed, I is allowed, A is allowed. However, MAFIA is a valid word.
- _ A _ I _ : MAJOR (R ruled out), MAFIA (considered), MAJIG (G ruled out), MAJOR (R ruled out), MAJIX (X allowed, but X is rare), MAJOR (R ruled out), MAJOR (R ruled out).
- _ A I _ _ : MAJOR (R ruled out), MIAOU (O allowed, but uncommon), MIAOW (O allowed, but uncommon), MIAOU, MIAOW are obscure.
- _ A _ _ I : MAFIA (considered), MAMMA (considered), MAJOR (R ruled out), MAJIG (G ruled out), MAJIX (X allowed, but X is rare).

Best options seem to be MAMMA and MAFIA. Both fit the pattern and use allowed letters.

Between them:
- MAMMA: M A M M A – uses M twice, A twice. But A is only confirmed in position 2, so this has A in 2 and 5, which is fine.
- MAFIA: M A F I A – uses M, A, F, I, A. This introduces F and I in new positions.

MAFIA introduces F (new letter) and places I in position 4, but we know I is not in position 4 (from VAPID feedback: I is in word but not in position 4). Wait, VAPID feedback was V(x) A(✓) P(x) I(✓) D(x), meaning I is in the word but not in position 4. So I must be in 1, 3, or 5.

MAFIA has I in position 4, which is invalid (since I is not in position 4). So MAFIA is invalid.

Thus, I must be in 1, 3, or 5.

Looking again:

- I A _ _ _ : IA is not common.
- _ A I _ _ : Third letter I.
- _ A _ _ I : Fifth letter I.

Possible words:
- _ A I _ _ : MAJOR (R ruled out), MIAOU (O allowed, but uncommon), MIAOW (O allowed, but uncommon), MIAOU, MIAOW are obscure.
- _ A _ _ I : MAMMA (M A M M A – A in 2 and 5), MAFIA (invalid as I in 4), MAJOR (R ruled out), MAJIG (G ruled out), MAJIX (X allowed, but X is rare).

MAMMA is valid: M A M M A. It has A in 2 and 5, but we don’t know about 5 yet. It uses M twice, which is allowed.

Another option: _ A _ I _ : MAJOR (R ruled out), MAFIA (invalid), MAJIG (G ruled out), MAJIX (X allowed, but X is rare).

No clear common word. Let’s think differently: remaining letters are F, H, J, M, O, Q, U, W, X, Z.

Looking for _ A _ _ _ with I in 1,3,5:

- I A _ _ _ : IA is rare, but IACON (C ruled out), IADIS (S ruled out), IALAN (L ruled out), IANUS (S ruled out, N ruled out), IAMBE (E ruled out), IAMBO (O allowed), IAMBO is a word (a metrical foot), but uncommon.
- _ A I _ _ : MAJOR (R ruled out), MIAOU (O allowed), MIAOW (O allowed), MIAOU, MIAOW are obscure.
- _ A _ _ I : MAMMA (M A M M A), MAFIA (invalid), MAJOR (R ruled out), MAJIG (G ruled out), MAJIX (X allowed).

MAMMA seems the best available, even if it repeats letters.

But let’s check if there’s a better word: MAJOR is invalid (R ruled out), MAFIA invalid (I in 4), MAMMA seems the only common word.

Thus, the next guess is MAMMA.

But wait, MAMMA uses M twice, which is allowed. It has:
- M (allowed)
- A (fixed in 2)
- M (allowed)
- M (allowed)
- A (allowed, but position 5 not confirmed)

However, we know I must be in 1,3, or 5. MAMMA has no I, which is invalid because I is in the word (from VAPID feedback: I is in word but not in 4).

Thus, MAMMA is invalid (no I).

We must include I.

Looking again for _ A _ _ _ with I in 1,3,5 and allowed letters.

Possible:
- I A _ _ _ : IA is rare, but IACON (C ruled out), IADIS (S ruled out), IAMBE (E ruled out), IAMBO (O allowed), IAMBO is a word (a metrical foot), but uncommon.
- _ A I _ _ : MAJOR (R ruled out), MIAOU (O allowed), MIAOW (O allowed), MIAOU, MIAOW are obscure.
- _ A _ _ I : MAJOR (R ruled out), MAFIA (invalid), MAJIG (G ruled out), MAJIX (X allowed).

The only valid word seems to be IAMBO (I A M B O), but B is ruled out.

Thus, the only remaining possibility is _ A _ _ I with I in 5, but no common word.

Re-evaluating: perhaps I is in position 3.

Looking for _ A I _ _ with allowed letters:

- MAJOR (R ruled out)
- MIAOU (O allowed)
- MIAOW (O allowed)

MIAOU is a valid word (a cat’s cry), and MIAOW is a variant.

Between them, MIAOU is slightly more common.

Thus, the next guess should be MIAOU.

Check letters: M, I, A, O, U. All allowed:
- M: allowed
- I: allowed (in position 3)
- A: fixed in 2

This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is MIAOU.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize information

One of the most popular and effective starting words is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S, L, T (common consonants)
- A, E (common vowels)
- No repeated letters
This should give me good coverage of frequently used letters in 5-letter words.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are all absent (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5).

Since S, L, T, E are ruled out, I need a new word that:
1. Contains A (and not in position 3).
2. Uses other common letters that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoids S, L, T, E entirely.

Good remaining consonants to test: R, N, C, D, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, O, U.

A strong next guess should use A in a new position and introduce several new common letters. “CRANK” is a good choice because:
- C, R, N, K are all new letters.
- A is moved to position 2 (was position 3 before).
- It’s a common word and uses frequently occurring letters.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: CRANK -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) K(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
   - Letters ruled out: S, L, T, E
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. CRANK → C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) K(x)
   - Letters ruled out: C, R, N, K
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (again) and also not in position 3 here, so we now know A is not in position 3 or 4.

So far:
- A must be in position 1, 2, or 5.
- Ruled-out letters: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K.
- Remaining common letters to test: D, G, H, M, P, V, W, Y, I, O, U, B, F, etc.

We need a word that:
- Contains A in position 1, 2, or 5.
- Uses only the remaining letters.
- Uses new common letters to maximize information.

Good candidates:
- If A is in position 1: A _ _ _ _
  - ADOPT uses D, O, P, T (but T is ruled out).
  - ADORE uses D, O, R (R is ruled out).
  - AGING uses G, I, N (N is ruled out).
  - AMBIT uses M, B, I, T (T ruled out).
  - AMISS uses M, I, S (S ruled out).
  - AMPLY uses M, P, L (L ruled out).
  - ANGEL uses N, G, E, L (N and E and L ruled out).
  - APHID uses P, H, I, D.
  - APHYS uses P, H, Y, S (S ruled out).
  - APYURS (not a valid word).

- If A is in position 2: _ A _ _ _
  - BAGGY uses B, G, Y.
  - DAILY uses D, I, L (L ruled out).
  - GAMER uses G, M, E (E ruled out).
  - GUMMY uses G, M, Y.
  - HABIT uses H, B, I, T (T ruled out).
  - MAMBA uses M, B.
  - PAPAW uses P, P, W (double P, W is fine).
  - PAVLOP (not common).
  - VAPOR uses V, O, R (R ruled out).
  - VAPID uses V, I, D.

- If A is in position 5: _ _ _ _ A
  - BOUND uses B, O, U, N (N ruled out).
  - DOUBT uses D, O, U, T (T ruled out).
  - GUMMY ends with Y, not A.
  - HUMID uses H, U, M, I, D.
  - MUDRA uses M, U, D, R (R ruled out).
  - PUDGY uses P, U, D, G, Y.

The best options seem to be:
- HABIT (but T is ruled out)
- GAMER (E ruled out)
- BAGGY (good letters B, G, Y)
- GUMMY (good letters G, M, M, Y)
- HUMID (H, U, M, I, D)

HUMID uses 5 new letters (H, U, M, I, D) and places A in position 5, which we haven't tested yet for A. However, HUMID does not contain A, so this is invalid.

Looking back, we need a word with A in 1, 2, or 5 positions, using only allowed letters.

Best fit:
- BAGGY: B, A, G, G, Y. Contains A in position 2. Uses B, G, Y (all new). Valid.

Another option:
- GAMMA: G, A, M, M, A. Contains A in positions 2 and 5. Uses G, M (new letters). Valid, but has double M.

Between BAGGY and GAMMA, BAGGY seems better for information.

But let's check if BAGGY is valid: yes, it's a common word.

Therefore, I'll choose BAGGY as it tests B, G, Y while placing A in position 2.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on BAGGY:
- B, G, G, Y are all absent (x).
- A is now confirmed in position 2 (✓).

So far we know:
- A is fixed in position 2.
- Ruled-out letters: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K, B, G, Y.
- Remaining letters to try: D, H, I, M, O, P, U, V, W, F, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2.
- No S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K, B, G, Y.
- Uses other remaining letters.

Good candidates:
- _ A _ _ _ with allowed letters.
- Possible consonants: D, H, M, P, V, W, F.
- Possible vowels: I, O, U.

Let's think of words:
- D A _ _ _ : DAILY (L ruled out), DAMN (too short), DAWNS (S ruled out), DAWNY (Y ruled out), DAWNS invalid.
- H A _ _ _ : HAMMY (M,Y but Y ruled out), HAPLY (Y ruled out), HAVOC (O,C ruled out), HASTY (S,Y ruled out), HABIT (B ruled out), HUMID (doesn't have A), HUMOR (O,R ruled out), HUMID (no A), HUMPH (H,P,F), HUMPY (Y ruled out).
- M A _ _ _ : MADAM (D,M), but D is allowed, M is allowed, but A is in position 2, so MADAM: M A D A M. This uses M, A, D, M. But A is already fixed in position 2, and the word would have A in position 4 as well, which is fine. However, MADAM uses D (allowed) and M (allowed), and no ruled-out letters.
- P A _ _ _ : PAPAW (W allowed), but has double P.
- V A _ _ _ : VAPID (I,D allowed), but D is allowed, I is allowed.
- W A _ _ _ : WAMBY (Y ruled out), WANDY (Y ruled out), WAMPS (S ruled out), WAMMY (Y ruled out), WAFER (E ruled out), WAFUL (F,U allowed), but F and U are allowed, but WAFUL is less common.
- F A _ _ _ : FANCY (C,Y ruled out), FABLE (E,B ruled out), FADGE (G,E ruled out), FADIS (S ruled out), FADLY (Y ruled out), FADOM (O,M allowed), but FADOM is obscure.

MADAM seems the best option: uses M, A, D, M. It has A in position 2 (confirmed), and uses D and M which are new letters. It also avoids all ruled-out letters.

Another option: VAPID (V,A,P,I,D) - all letters allowed and new.
But MADAM is more common and uses M and D.

Between MADAM and VAPID, MADAM seems better.

But let's check MADAM: M A D A M. This has A in position 2 and 4. Since we only know A is in position 2, position 4 could be A or another letter. However, the feedback doesn't say anything about other positions except position 2 for A. So MADAM is acceptable.

But VAPID is also valid: V A P I D. All letters are new.

Between these, VAPID introduces more new letters (V,P,I,D) compared to MADAM (M,D). So VAPID is better for information.

Therefore, the next guess should be VAPID.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: CRANK -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) K(x)
Guess 3: BAGGY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) G(x) G(x) Y(x)
Guess 4: VAPID -> FEEDBACK: V(x) A(✓) P(x) I(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback so far:

1. A is fixed in position 2 (✓).
2. I is in the word but not in position 4 (✓).
3. Ruled-out letters: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K, B, G, Y, V, P, D.

So the word has the pattern: _ A _ _ _ with:
- I somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 5 (since it’s not in 4).
- Allowed letters left: F, H, J, M, O, Q, U, W, X, Z (plus any others not yet ruled out).

Possible consonants: F, H, J, M, O (sometimes vowel), Q, U, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word matching _ A _ _ _ that uses I in 1, 3, or 5 and only allowed letters.

Let’s list possibilities:

- I A _ _ _ : IA is not a common start, and remaining letters must fit. IA is rare in English.
- _ A I _ _ : Third letter I.
- _ A _ _ I : Fifth letter I.

Looking for common words:

- _ A I _ _ : MAJOR (but J is allowed, O is allowed, R is ruled out), MAJOR invalid.
- _ A _ _ I : MAMMA (M,M), but M is allowed, but double M and A already fixed. MAMMA: M A M M A – but A is only confirmed in position 2, so this has A in 2 and 5, which is fine, but M is allowed. However, MAMMA uses M twice and A twice, which might not be optimal.
- _ A _ _ I : FAMAS (S ruled out), HAMAL (L ruled out), JAMMY (Y ruled out), MAMMA (already considered), WAMBI (B ruled out), WAMMY (Y ruled out).
- _ A I _ _ : MAMIA (A already in 2), MAJOR (R ruled out), MIAOU (O allowed, but uncommon), MIAOW (O allowed, but uncommon), MIAOU, MIAOW are obscure.
- _ A _ I _ : MAJOR (R ruled out), MAFIA (F allowed, A already in 2, but F is allowed, I allowed, A already in 2, but this would be M A F I A – but A is only in position 2 confirmed, so this has A in 2 and 5, which is fine. MAFIA uses F, A, F, I, A – but F is allowed, I is allowed, A is allowed. However, MAFIA is a valid word.
- _ A _ I _ : MAJOR (R ruled out), MAFIA (considered), MAJIG (G ruled out), MAJOR (R ruled out), MAJIX (X allowed, but X is rare), MAJOR (R ruled out), MAJOR (R ruled out).
- _ A I _ _ : MAJOR (R ruled out), MIAOU (O allowed, but uncommon), MIAOW (O allowed, but uncommon), MIAOU, MIAOW are obscure.
- _ A _ _ I : MAFIA (considered), MAMMA (considered), MAJOR (R ruled out), MAJIG (G ruled out), MAJIX (X allowed, but X is rare).

Best options seem to be MAMMA and MAFIA. Both fit the pattern and use allowed letters.

Between them:
- MAMMA: M A M M A – uses M twice, A twice. But A is only confirmed in position 2, so this has A in 2 and 5, which is fine.
- MAFIA: M A F I A – uses M, A, F, I, A. This introduces F and I in new positions.

MAFIA introduces F (new letter) and places I in position 4, but we know I is not in position 4 (from VAPID feedback: I is in word but not in position 4). Wait, VAPID feedback was V(x) A(✓) P(x) I(✓) D(x), meaning I is in the word but not in position 4. So I must be in 1, 3, or 5.

MAFIA has I in position 4, which is invalid (since I is not in position 4). So MAFIA is invalid.

Thus, I must be in 1, 3, or 5.

Looking again:

- I A _ _ _ : IA is not common.
- _ A I _ _ : Third letter I.
- _ A _ _ I : Fifth letter I.

Possible words:
- _ A I _ _ : MAJOR (R ruled out), MIAOU (O allowed, but uncommon), MIAOW (O allowed, but uncommon), MIAOU, MIAOW are obscure.
- _ A _ _ I : MAMMA (M A M M A – A in 2 and 5), MAFIA (invalid as I in 4), MAJOR (R ruled out), MAJIG (G ruled out), MAJIX (X allowed, but X is rare).

MAMMA is valid: M A M M A. It has A in 2 and 5, but we don’t know about 5 yet. It uses M twice, which is allowed.

Another option: _ A _ I _ : MAJOR (R ruled out), MAFIA (invalid), MAJIG (G ruled out), MAJIX (X allowed, but X is rare).

No clear common word. Let’s think differently: remaining letters are F, H, J, M, O, Q, U, W, X, Z.

Looking for _ A _ _ _ with I in 1,3,5:

- I A _ _ _ : IA is rare, but IACON (C ruled out), IADIS (S ruled out), IALAN (L ruled out), IANUS (S ruled out, N ruled out), IAMBE (E ruled out), IAMBO (O allowed), IAMBO is a word (a metrical foot), but uncommon.
- _ A I _ _ : MAJOR (R ruled out), MIAOU (O allowed), MIAOW (O allowed), MIAOU, MIAOW are obscure.
- _ A _ _ I : MAMMA (M A M M A), MAFIA (invalid), MAJOR (R ruled out), MAJIG (G ruled out), MAJIX (X allowed).

MAMMA seems the best available, even if it repeats letters.

But let’s check if there’s a better word: MAJOR is invalid (R ruled out), MAFIA invalid (I in 4), MAMMA seems the only common word.

Thus, the next guess is MAMMA.

But wait, MAMMA uses M twice, which is allowed. It has:
- M (allowed)
- A (fixed in 2)
- M (allowed)
- M (allowed)
- A (allowed, but position 5 not confirmed)

However, we know I must be in 1,3, or 5. MAMMA has no I, which is invalid because I is in the word (from VAPID feedback: I is in word but not in 4).

Thus, MAMMA is invalid (no I).

We must include I.

Looking again for _ A _ _ _ with I in 1,3,5 and allowed letters.

Possible:
- I A _ _ _ : IA is rare, but IACON (C ruled out), IADIS (S ruled out), IAMBE (E ruled out), IAMBO (O allowed), IAMBO is a word (a metrical foot), but uncommon.
- _ A I _ _ : MAJOR (R ruled out), MIAOU (O allowed), MIAOW (O allowed), MIAOU, MIAOW are obscure.
- _ A _ _ I : MAJOR (R ruled out), MAFIA (invalid), MAJIG (G ruled out), MAJIX (X allowed).

The only valid word seems to be IAMBO (I A M B O), but B is ruled out.

Thus, the only remaining possibility is _ A _ _ I with I in 5, but no common word.

Re-evaluating: perhaps I is in position 3.

Looking for _ A I _ _ with allowed letters:

- MAJOR (R ruled out)
- MIAOU (O allowed)
- MIAOW (O allowed)

MIAOU is a valid word (a cat’s cry), and MIAOW is a variant.

Between them, MIAOU is slightly more common.

Thus, the next guess should be MIAOU.

Check letters: M, I, A, O, U. All allowed:
- M: allowed
- I: allowed (in position 3)
- A: fixed in 2
- O: allowed
- U: allowed

This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is MIAOU.

From the latest feedback on MIAOU:

- M(✓) → M is in position 1 and is correct.
- I(-) → I is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3 (but we already know A is in position 2 from BAGGY, so this is consistent).
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- U(x) → U is not in the word.

So the word pattern is now: M A _ _ _ (since A is confirmed in position 2 and M in position 1).

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):
- From all previous guesses, ruled-out letters include: S, L, T, E, C, R, N, K, B, G, Y, V, P, D, O, U.

Remaining consonants: F, H, J, Q, W, X, Z.
Remaining vowels: I (must appear somewhere, but not in position 2).

Since I must appear and can't be in position 2, it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Possible patterns:
- M A I _ _
- M A _ I _
- M A _ _ I

Looking for common 5-letter words fitting these patterns with remaining letters.

1. M A I _ _:
   - MAJOR (R ruled out)
   - MIAOU (O, U ruled out)
   - MAIZE (Z allowed, E ruled out)
   - MAJOR, MAIZE invalid.

2. M A _ I _:
   - MAJIG (G ruled out)
   - MAJIX (X allowed, but word is obscure)
   - MAJIS (S ruled out)
   - MAJIX seems the only candidate, but rare.

3. M A _ _ I:
   - MAJIG (G ruled out)
   - MAJIX (X allowed)
   - MAJIS (S ruled out)
   - MAJIX again.

However, MAJIX is obscure. Let's think of other possibilities.

Another approach: check if any remaining letters can form a common word.

Looking at M A _ _ I:
   - MAJIG (G ruled out)
   - MAJIX (X allowed)
   - MAJIS (S ruled out)
   - MAJIX seems the only valid word here.

But MAJIX is not common. Let's reconsider if I must be in position 3.

Pattern M A I _ _:
   - MAJOR (R ruled out)
   - MAJIG (G ruled out)
   - MAJIX (X allowed)
   - MAJIX again.

This seems limited. Perhaps we missed something.

Wait, let's list remaining letters again:
Allowed letters: M, A, I, F, H, J, Q, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word starting with MA, containing I, and using only allowed letters.

Possible combinations:
- MA I _ _ : MA I F _ → MAIF_ (no common word)
- MA _ I _ : MA F I _ → MAFI_ (no)
- MA _ _ I : MA F F I (MAFFI - no), MA J I _ (MAJI_ - no), MA X I _ (MA X I_ - no), MA Z I _ (MA Z I_ - no).

This is restrictive. Let's check if any common words fit.

Actually, the only remaining possibility seems to be MAJIX, but it's obscure.

Rechecking the feedback: all previous letters except M, A, I are ruled out. The word must be M A _ _ _ with I in 3, 4, or 5.

Looking at remaining letters: F, H, J, Q, W, X, Z.

Possible word: MAJIX (M A J I X) - but X is allowed, and it's a valid (though rare) word.

Alternatively, MAJIG is invalid (G ruled out).

Thus, the most plausible word, despite being obscure, is MAJIX.

But let's verify: MAJIX is a variant spelling of ""majesty"" in some contexts, but not standard.

Another possibility: MAJIX is actually a valid word (a type of plant).

Given the constraints, MAJIX seems to be the only valid guess left.

Therefore, the next guess is MAJIX.
