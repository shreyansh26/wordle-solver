### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should use these letters to quickly identify which ones are in the secret word.

Some excellent first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as my first guess because it includes three very common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N), giving us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

All five letters in CRANE were marked “x”, so none of C, R, A, N, E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That’s a huge clue: we now know the word must be composed entirely of letters that are NOT among those five.  
To maximize information on the second guess, I’ll pick a word that uses entirely new, common letters.  
Good candidates would avoid C, R, A, N, E and instead use common consonants like S, T, L, D, M, P and vowels like I, O, U.  
A strong choice is “STOIC” (S, T, O, I, C), but C is already excluded.  
Next, “SLOTH” uses S, L, O, T, H – all still possible.  
Another option is “MOUTH” (M, O, U, T, H).  
I’ll go with “SLOTH” because it tests five fresh, fairly common letters.

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing I (but not in position 3), and using only the remaining letters. Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels like A, E, I, O, U and consonants like R, S, T, L, N. A good starting word should use these letters to quickly identify which ones are in the secret word.

Some excellent first guesses include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- STARE (covers S, T, A, R, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" as my first guess because it includes three very common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N), giving us good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in CRANE were marked “x”, so none of C, R, A, N, E appear anywhere in the secret word.  
That’s a huge clue: we now know the word must be composed entirely of letters that are NOT among those five.  
To maximize information on the second guess, I’ll pick a word that uses entirely new, common letters.  
Good candidates would avoid C, R, A, N, E and instead use common consonants like S, T, L, D, M, P and vowels like I, O, U.  
A strong choice is “STOIC” (S, T, O, I, C), but C is already excluded.  
Next, “SLOTH” uses S, L, O, T, H – all still possible.  
Another option is “MOUTH” (M, O, U, T, H).  
I’ll go with “SLOTH” because it tests five fresh, fairly common letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, L, O, T, H  
2. Letters confirmed IN the word: S (and it is in the first position)

So the secret word looks like: S _ _ _ _  
and must be composed only from the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

To maximize information, the next guess should:
- keep the S fixed in the first position,
- use five entirely new letters (none of the excluded ones),
- ideally include some common remaining consonants and vowels.

Common remaining letters include: I, U, D, M, K, P, etc.  
A good candidate is “SUKID” (S, U, K, I, D) – all letters are still possible.  
Another could be “SPURN” but R is already excluded.  
“SMITH” uses H which is excluded.  
“SKIMP” is also valid.  
I’ll choose “SKIMP” because it uses common letters and tests five fresh ones.

However, “SQUIG” is less common. Let’s try “SQUIX” which is a valid word (a type of insect). 

But looking at the remaining letters, the most plausible common word is actually “SQUIG”. However, since we’ve exhausted common words, let’s try “SQUIX”.

Current known facts:

- Word pattern: S _ _ _ _
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, L, O, T, H, K, M, P
- Letters confirmed IN the word: S (position 1), I (somewhere in positions 2-5, but not position 3)

Remaining possible letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing I (but not in position 3), and using only the remaining letters. Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Possible candidates:
- SUDID (but D is repeated)
- SIBYL (but Y and L are excluded)
- SUGAR (but A and R are excluded)
- SQUID (but Q and U are possible, D is possible, but D is already considered)
- SWIPE (but P and E are excluded)
- SIBER (but E and R are excluded)
- SIBID (but D is possible)
- SIBUX (but X is possible)

Looking at the remaining letters, a good choice is ""SIBID"" but it's not a common word. Another option is ""SUGAR"" but A and R are excluded. ""SQUID"" uses S, Q, U, I, D - all possible letters except D is possible, but D wasn't tested yet.

""SQUID"" seems like a good choice because it uses:
- S (confirmed in position 1)
- Q (new letter)
- U (new letter)
- I (confirmed in word, position unknown)
- D (new letter)

This tests three new letters (Q, U, D) while keeping S and I in their known positions.

From all feedback so far:

1. Pattern: S Q U I _  (positions 1-4 are locked in)
2. Letters definitely NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, E, L, O, T, H, K, M, P, D
3. Remaining possible letters for position 5: B, F, G, J, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with “SQU” and ends with one of those remaining letters. The only common English word that fits is:

- SQUIG (but G is still possible)
- SQUIX (but X is possible)
- SQUIV (but V is possible)

The most common and likely word among these is “SQUIG” (though it’s slang), but a more standard word is “SQUID” already tried. Rechecking, the only valid word left is “SQUIG” or “SQUIX”. 

However, “SQUIG” is less common. Let’s try “SQUIX” which is a valid word (a type of insect). 

But looking at the remaining letters, the most plausible common word is actually “SQUIG”. However, since we’ve exhausted common words, let’s try “SQUIX”.

But wait, let me re-examine: the only remaining letters are B, F, G, J, V, W, X, Y, Z. The valid word starting with SQU and ending with one of these is “SQUIG” (G is allowed). 

Thus, the correct next guess is “SQUIG”.
