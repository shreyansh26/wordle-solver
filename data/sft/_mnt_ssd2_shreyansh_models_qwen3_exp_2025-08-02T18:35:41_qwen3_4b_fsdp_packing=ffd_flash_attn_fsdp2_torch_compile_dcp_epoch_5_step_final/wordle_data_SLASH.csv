For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:

- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because it covers very common letters (S, L, A, T, E) and can quickly reveal vowels and consonants. This will help narrow down possibilities for the remaining guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S is correct in position 1
- L is correct in position 2
- A is correct in the word but NOT in position 3
- T is not in the word at all
- E is not in the word at all

So we know:
1. Word starts with SL
2. The third letter is NOT A
3. The word contains A somewhere, but not in position 3
4. No T or E anywhere

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with SL
- Has A in position 4 or 5
- Does not contain T or E

Possible patterns: S L _ A _ or S L _ _ A

Looking for common words fitting this pattern:
- SLANT: has T (invalid)
- SLASH: has A in position 4 and ends with H (valid)
- SLAIN: has A in position 4 and ends with N (valid)
- SLACK: has A in position 4 and ends with K (valid)

Among these, ""SLASH"" is a common word that fits all constraints.
