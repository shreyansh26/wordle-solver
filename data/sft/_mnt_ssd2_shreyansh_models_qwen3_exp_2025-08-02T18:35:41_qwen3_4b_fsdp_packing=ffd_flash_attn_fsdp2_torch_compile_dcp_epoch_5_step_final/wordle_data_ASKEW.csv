For my first guess, I want to choose a word that contains common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong opening guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S). This gives me a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word early on.

Another strong option is ""SLATE"" which includes S, L, A, T, E - covering many common letters. However, ""AROSE"" might be slightly better because A and E are among the most common vowels, and O is also quite common. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct first position.
- R(x) – R is not in the word at all.
- O(x) – O is not in the word at all.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in the 4th position.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So we know:
1. Word starts with A.
2. Contains S and E somewhere, but not in positions 4 and 5 respectively.
3. Does NOT contain R or O.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with A.
- Has S and E somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 5 (since S cannot be 4th and E cannot be 5th).
- Does not contain R or O.

Possible positions for S and E:
- S could be 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.
- E could be 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

Let’s think of words fitting these constraints:
- A _ _ _ _ (first letter A)
- Must include S and E in allowed positions.
- No R or O.

One candidate is ""ADEPT"":
- Starts with A.
- Has E in 2nd and S in 5th (but S is not allowed in 5th because E is not allowed in 5th, but S can be 5th - the feedback only says E is not in 5th). Wait, the feedback says E(-) means E is in the word but not in 5th. So E can be 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. S(-) means S is in the word but not in 4th, so S can be 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.

Let’s check ""ADEPT"":
- A ✓
- D - (unknown)
- E in 3rd (allowed)
- P - (unknown)
- T - (unknown)
But we need to include S somewhere. ""ADEPT"" doesn't have S, so this is invalid.

Next candidate: ""ASIDE"":
- Starts with A.
- S in 2nd (allowed).
- I - (unknown)
- D - (unknown)
- E in 5th (but E cannot be in 5th per feedback). So this is invalid.

Next: ""AESIR"" – but this is a proper noun (an old English word for ""thee""), and may not be valid in Wordle's dictionary.

Next: ""AEONS"" – but O is excluded.

Next: ""ASSET"":
- Starts with A.
- S in 2nd and 4th. But S cannot be in 4th (from feedback S(-)), so this is invalid.

Next: ""ASENS"" – but S is in 4th again, invalid.

Next: ""ASIDE"" already invalid.

Next: ""ASKEW"":
- Starts with A.
- S in 2nd (allowed).
- K - (unknown)
- E in 4th (allowed)
- W - (unknown)
This fits all constraints: A ✓, S in 2nd (allowed), E in 4th (allowed), no R or O.

Let me verify:
- A ✓
- S in 2nd (not 4th) – allowed
- E in 4th (not 5th) – allowed
- No R or O – correct
- ASKEW is a valid 5-letter word.

So ""ASKEW"" seems like a good second guess.
