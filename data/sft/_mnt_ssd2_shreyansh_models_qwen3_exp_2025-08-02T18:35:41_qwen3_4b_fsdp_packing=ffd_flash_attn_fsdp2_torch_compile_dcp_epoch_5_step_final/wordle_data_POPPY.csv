For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a high chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Remaining vowels: I, U (since A and E are out, and O is confirmed).

A good next guess should test new common letters while incorporating the known O. Let's try ""POINT"":
- P (common consonant)
- O (known to be in word, not in position 3)
- I (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- T (common consonant)

This tests P, I, N, T while placing O in position 2 (different from position 3).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a high chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, S, E.
- Letter definitely present (but not in position 3): O.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O, but not in the 3rd position.
2. Does not contain A, R, S, E.
3. Uses only remaining common letters to maximize information gain.

Remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, G, B, M, P, H, F, Y, K, V, W, X, Z, Q, J.
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A and E are out, and O is confirmed).

A good next guess should test new common letters while incorporating the known O. Let's try ""POINT"":
- P (common consonant)
- O (known to be in word, not in position 3)
- I (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- T (common consonant)

This tests P, I, N, T while placing O in position 2 (different from position 3).

Current confirmed information:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, I, N, T
- Letters confirmed IN the word:
  – P is in position 1 (✓)
  – O is in position 2 (✓)
- Remaining letters to test (common ones): C, D, G, B, L, M, U, Y, K, F, H, V, W

We need a 5-letter word that starts with “PO” and uses only letters not yet ruled out.  
Available letters for positions 3-5: C, D, G, B, L, M, U, Y, K, F, H, V, W (plus O again, but it’s already used and not ruled out).

Common endings for “PO”:
- POGGY (but G and Y are okay, G is repeated)
- POKER (but R is ruled out)
- POUND (N is ruled out)
- POLLY (L is okay, but Y is okay)
- POMMY (M is okay)
- POKEY (K is okay)

Let’s pick “POKEY”:
- P(✓) O(✓) K (new) E (ruled out) Y (new) – but E is ruled out, so this is invalid.

Next option: “POGGY” – G and Y are allowed, but double G may not be optimal.

Better: “POULY” – but U and L and Y are allowed, but “POULY” is not a common word.

Another: “POMMY” – M is allowed, but double M.

Another: “PODGY” – D, G, Y are allowed.

“PODGY” seems good:
- P(✓) O(✓) D (new) G (new) Y (new)
- All letters are allowed by current constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives us a high chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word, helping narrow down possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in the 3rd position.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, S, E.
- Letter definitely present (but not in position 3): O.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O, but not in the 3rd position.
2. Does not contain A, R, S, E.
3. Uses only remaining common letters to maximize information gain.

Remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, G, B, M, P, H, F, Y, K, V, W, X, Z, Q, J.
Remaining vowels: I, U (since A and E are out, and O is confirmed).

A good next guess should test new common letters while incorporating the known O. Let's try ""POINT"":
- P (common consonant)
- O (known to be in word, not in position 3)
- I (common vowel)
- N (common consonant)
- T (common consonant)

This tests P, I, N, T while placing O in position 2 (different from position 3).

Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) I(x) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current confirmed information:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, S, E, I, N, T
- Letters confirmed IN the word:
  – P is in position 1 (✓)
  – O is in position 2 (✓)
- Remaining letters to test (common ones): C, D, G, B, L, M, U, Y, K, F, H, V, W

We need a 5-letter word that starts with “PO” and uses only letters not yet ruled out.  
Available letters for positions 3-5: C, D, G, B, L, M, U, Y, K, F, H, V, W (plus O again, but it’s already used and not ruled out).

Common endings for “PO”:
- POGGY (but G and Y are okay, G is repeated)
- POKER (but R is ruled out)
- POUND (N is ruled out)
- POLLY (L is okay, but Y is okay)
- POMMY (M is okay)
- POKEY (K is okay)

Let’s pick “POKEY”:
- P(✓) O(✓) K (new) E (ruled out) Y (new) – but E is ruled out, so this is invalid.

Next option: “POGGY” – G and Y are allowed, but double G may not be optimal.

Better: “POULY” – but U and L and Y are allowed, but “POULY” is not a common word.

Another: “POMMY” – M is allowed, but double M.

Another: “PODGY” – D, G, Y are allowed.

“PODGY” seems good:
- P(✓) O(✓) D (new) G (new) Y (new)
- All letters are allowed by current constraints.

Let’s go with PODGY.

Current confirmed facts:
1. Letters in the word and their positions:
   - P in position 1 (✓)
   - O in position 2 (✓)
   - Y in position 5 (✓)
2. Letters NOT in the word:
   A, R, S, E, I, N, T, D, G
3. Letters still available for positions 3 and 4:
   B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z
4. We need a 5-letter word that starts with “PO” and ends with “Y”, using only allowed letters in the middle.

Possible patterns: P O _ _ Y

Let’s brainstorm common letters for positions 3 and 4:
- Common consonants left: B, C, F, H, K, L, M, V, W
- Common vowels left: U (only one left)

Try combinations:
- POBY_ – but “POBY_” isn’t a common word.
- POC_ – “POCKY” is a word (variant spelling of “pocket”), but K is allowed.
- POF_ – no common 5-letter word.
- POM_ – “POMMY” but M is allowed, but double M.
- POL_ – “POLLY” – L is allowed, double L.
- POV_ – “POV” is a prefix but not a word.
- POU_ – “POUCH” but ends with H, not Y.

“POCKY” uses:
- P(✓) O(✓) C (new) K (new) Y(✓)
- All letters allowed.

“POLLY” uses:
- P(✓) O(✓) L (new) L (new) Y(✓)
- All letters allowed.

Between these, “POCKY” tests two new consonants (C, K) while “POLLY” tests L twice. “POCKY” seems better for information gain.

Let’s go with P O C K Y.

   A, R, S, E, I, N, T, D, G, K
3. Available letters (excluding the eliminated ones):

4. We need a 5-letter word of the form P O _ _ Y using only the available letters in positions 3 and 4.

Possible combinations for positions 3 and 4:
