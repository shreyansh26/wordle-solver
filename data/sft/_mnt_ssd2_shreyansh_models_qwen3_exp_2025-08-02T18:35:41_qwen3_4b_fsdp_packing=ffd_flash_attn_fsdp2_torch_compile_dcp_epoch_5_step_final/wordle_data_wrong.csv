For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants. This helps narrow down the possibilities efficiently.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the correct position (second letter).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
2. O appears somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
3. No A, S, E.

Good next guesses should:
- Keep R in position 2.
- Include O in a different spot.
- Avoid A, S, E.
- Use other common letters to gather more info.

A strong candidate is ""ROUND"":
- Keeps R in position 2.
- Moves O to position 3 (new position).
- Uses common letters N, U, D to test new possibilities.
- Avoids A, S, E.

This maximizes information gain while respecting the constraints.

From the new feedback on ROUND:

- R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1 and now marked “-”).  
  Since we already know R is in position 2 (from AROSE), this confirms R is fixed there.

- O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3 and now marked “-”).  
  So O must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

- U and D are not in the word.

- N is in the correct position (position 4).

So far we know:
Pattern: _ R _ N _  
O must appear in position 1 or 5 (since it can’t be 3).

Good letters to test next: common consonants like T, L, C, M, plus vowels I and Y.  
We also need to place O somewhere valid.

Candidate words:
- CORN_ → O in position 1: CORNY (but Y is less common)
- _ R O N _ → but O would be in position 3, which is invalid (already ruled out)
- _ R _ N O → O in position 5: try FRINO, GRINO, PRINO, etc.

A simple, common word that fits: FRINO is obscure, so let’s try GRINO instead.  
GRINO: G, R, I, N, O  
- G: new letter  
- R: position 2 (confirmed)  
- I: new vowel  
- N: position 4 (confirmed)  
- O: position 5 (new position for O)

This tests three new letters (G, I, O) while respecting all constraints.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

From all feedback:

1. R is in position 2 (✓ in both AROSE and GRINO).
2. N is in position 4 (✓ in ROUND and GRINO).
3. O is in the word but never in position 3 (ROUND) or 5 (GRINO), so O must be in position 1.
4. G is in the word but not in position 1 (GRINO feedback: G(-)), so G must be in position 3 or 4.  
   But position 4 is already N, so G must be in position 3.
5. I is not in the word (GRINO feedback: I(x)).
6. A, S, E, U, D, I are all ruled out.
7. Remaining unused common letters: T, L, C, M, Y, etc.

So the pattern is now fully determined:
- Position 1: O
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: G
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: ?

We need a single letter for position 5 that has not been ruled out and keeps the word valid.  
Available letters (common ones): T, L, C, M, Y.

A common word that fits is “ORGAN” (O-R-G-A-N), but A is already ruled out.  
Next best: “ORGAN” invalid (A), “ORGAM” (not a word), “ORGUN” (invalid), “ORGYN” (invalid).  

The only common word left is “ORGAN” (but A is out), so we must look for another.  
Wait – let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting O-R-G-N-? with remaining letters.

Valid word: “ORGAN” – A is out.  
“ORGAN” fails.  
Next: “ORGUM” (invalid).  
“ORGON” – O-R-G-O-N, but O is already used in position 1 and can’t repeat (Wordle rules don’t forbid repeats, but we have no evidence O repeats).  
“ORGON” is a valid word (a unit of energy in physics).

But let’s check simpler words first.  
“ORGAN” fails.  
“ORGUM” fails.  
“ORGON” seems the only valid word left that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters.

However, “ORGON” uses O twice – we have no evidence against it, but we want to avoid unnecessary repeats.  
Alternative: look for other letters for position 5.  
Available letters: T, L, C, M, Y.

“ORGNT” – invalid.  
“ORGNC” – invalid.  
“ORGNM” – invalid.  
“ORGNY” – invalid.

Actually, the only valid word fitting O-R-G-N-? with remaining letters is “ORGAN” (invalid due to A) and “ORGON” (possible).  
But let’s re-examine: we have O-R-G-N-? and need a valid word.

Upon reflection, the correct word must be “ORGAN” but A is out.  
Therefore, the only remaining valid word is “ORGON”.

But let’s verify:  
O(1) R(2) G(3) N(4) O(5) – this uses O twice, but we have no evidence against it.  
“ORGON” is a valid English word.

However, let’s check if we missed any simpler word.  
Alternative: position 5 could be T, making “ORGNT” – invalid.  
Therefore, the only valid word left is “ORGON”.

But let’s double-check: is there any other word?  
“ORGAN” fails (A).  
“ORGUM” fails.  
“ORGON” is the only valid word.

Therefore, the next guess must be “ORGON”.

But wait – let’s re-examine the constraints carefully.  
We have O-R-G-N-? and need a valid word.  
The only valid word is “ORGON”.

Thus, the next logical guess is:

4. G is in the word but not in position 1 (GRINO feedback: G(-)), so G must be in position 3 or 4.  
   But position 4 is already N, so G must be in position 3.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants. This helps narrow down the possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the correct position (second letter).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
2. O appears somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
3. No A, S, E.

Good next guesses should:
- Keep R in position 2.
- Include O in a different spot.
- Avoid A, S, E.
- Use other common letters to gather more info.

A strong candidate is ""ROUND"":
- Keeps R in position 2.
- Moves O to position 3 (new position).
- Uses common letters N, U, D to test new possibilities.
- Avoids A, S, E.

This maximizes information gain while respecting the constraints.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ROUND:

- R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1 and now marked “-”).  
  Since we already know R is in position 2 (from AROSE), this confirms R is fixed there.

- O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3 and now marked “-”).  
  So O must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

- U and D are not in the word.

- N is in the correct position (position 4).

So far we know:
Pattern: _ R _ N _  
O must appear in position 1 or 5 (since it can’t be 3).

Good letters to test next: common consonants like T, L, C, M, plus vowels I and Y.  
We also need to place O somewhere valid.

Candidate words:
- CORN_ → O in position 1: CORNY (but Y is less common)
- _ R O N _ → but O would be in position 3, which is invalid (already ruled out)
- _ R _ N O → O in position 5: try FRINO, GRINO, PRINO, etc.

A simple, common word that fits: FRINO is obscure, so let’s try GRINO instead.  
GRINO: G, R, I, N, O  
- G: new letter  
- R: position 2 (confirmed)  
- I: new vowel  
- N: position 4 (confirmed)  
- O: position 5 (new position for O)

This tests three new letters (G, I, O) while respecting all constraints.

Let’s update the constraints from all four guesses.

1. R is in position 2 (✓ in AROSE, GRINO, ORGON).
2. N is in position 4 (✓ in ROUND, GRINO, ORGON).
3. O is in the word but:
   - not in position 3 (ROUND)
   - not in position 5 (GRINO)
   - not in position 1 (ORGON)
   Therefore, O must be in position 4, but position 4 is already N.  
   This is a contradiction unless O and N both occupy position 4, which is impossible.

Hence, the only resolution is that O is not in the word at all.  
But this contradicts the earlier feedback that O is in the word (from AROSE and ROUND).

This suggests we must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.  
Re-examining the feedback carefully:

- Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)  
  – O is in the word (✓), but position not specified.

- Guess 2: ROUND → R(-) O(-) U(x) N(✓) D(x)  
  – O is in the word but wrong position (-).

- Guess 3: GRINO → G(-) R(✓) I(x) N(✓) O(-)  
  – O is in the word but wrong position (-).

- Guess 4: ORGON → O(-) R(✓) G(-) O(-) N(-)  
  – O is in the word but wrong position (-) for both O’s.

The key is that the first O in ORGON (position 1) was marked (-), meaning O is in the word but not in position 1.  
The second O in ORGON (position 4) was also marked (-), meaning O is in the word but not in position 4.  
Thus, O cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, leaving only position 2.  
But position 2 is R (✓ from earlier).  
This is impossible unless the word contains two O’s, one in position 2 and one elsewhere, but position 2 is R.

This contradiction implies we must have misinterpreted the feedback.  
Rechecking Wordle rules: the feedback symbols apply to the letters in the guess, not necessarily indicating the entire word.  
The feedback for ORGON shows:

- O(-) : first letter O is in word but wrong position (so O is not in position 1).
- R(✓) : second letter R is correct (position 2).
- G(-) : third letter G is in word but wrong position (so G is not in position 3).
- O(-) : fourth letter O is in word but wrong position (so O is not in position 4).
- N(-) : fifth letter N is in word but wrong position (so N is not in position 5).

From this, we now know:
- Position 2 = R (✓)
- Position 4 = N (✓) – but the feedback for N in ORGON was (-), meaning N is in word but not position 5.  
  However, earlier feedback (ROUND) said N is in position 4 (✓).  
  This is consistent: N is in position 4.

So the word pattern is: _ R _ N _

O is in the word but:
- not position 1 (from ORGON first O)
- not position 3 (from ROUND)
- not position 4 (from ORGON second O)
- not position 5 (from GRINO)
Thus, O must be in position 2, but position 2 is R.  
This is impossible unless the word has two O’s, but position 2 is R.

This indicates we must have made an error.  
Re-examining the feedback for ROUND:  
ROUND → R(-) O(-) U(x) N(✓) D(x)  
This means:
- R is in word but not position 1
- O is in word but not position 2
- N is in position 4 (✓)

Similarly, GRINO → G(-) R(✓) I(x) N(✓) O(-)  
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- N is in position 4 (✓)
- O is in word but not position 5

ORGON → O(-) R(✓) G(-) O(-) N(-)  
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- N is in word but not position 5 (consistent with N in position 4)
- O is in word but not position 1 or 4

Thus, O must be in position 3 (since positions 1,2,4,5 are ruled out).  
Therefore, the word pattern is: _ R O N _

Now we need a letter for position 1 that has not been ruled out.  
Ruled-out letters so far: A, S, E, U, D, I, G (from G(-) in GRINO), plus any others used.

Available letters: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form ? R O N ?.  
Common words: BROWN, CROWN, DROWN (D ruled out), FROWN, GROWN (G ruled out), etc.

Valid options: BROWN, CROWN, FROWN, etc.  
We haven’t tested B, C, or F yet.

Let’s choose CROWN as the next guess.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should use several of these letters to quickly eliminate or confirm many possibilities.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives good coverage for vowels and consonants. This helps narrow down the possibilities efficiently.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the correct position (second letter).
- O is in the word but in the wrong position.
- A, S, E are not in the word at all.

So we know:
1. Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
2. O appears somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
3. No A, S, E.

Good next guesses should:
- Keep R in position 2.
- Include O in a different spot.
- Avoid A, S, E.
- Use other common letters to gather more info.

A strong candidate is ""ROUND"":
- Keeps R in position 2.
- Moves O to position 3 (new position).
- Uses common letters N, U, D to test new possibilities.
- Avoids A, S, E.

This maximizes information gain while respecting the constraints.

Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(-) U(x) N(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ROUND:

- R is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 1 and now marked “-”).  
  Since we already know R is in position 2 (from AROSE), this confirms R is fixed there.

- O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3 and now marked “-”).  
  So O must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

- U and D are not in the word.

- N is in the correct position (position 4).

So far we know:
Pattern: _ R _ N _  
O must appear in position 1 or 5 (since it can’t be 3).

Good letters to test next: common consonants like T, L, C, M, plus vowels I and Y.  
We also need to place O somewhere valid.

Candidate words:
- CORN_ → O in position 1: CORNY (but Y is less common)
- _ R O N _ → but O would be in position 3, which is invalid (already ruled out)
- _ R _ N O → O in position 5: try FRINO, GRINO, PRINO, etc.

A simple, common word that fits: FRINO is obscure, so let’s try GRINO instead.  
GRINO: G, R, I, N, O  
- G: new letter  
- R: position 2 (confirmed)  
- I: new vowel  
- N: position 4 (confirmed)  
- O: position 5 (new position for O)

This tests three new letters (G, I, O) while respecting all constraints.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

From all feedback:

1. R is in position 2 (✓ in both AROSE and GRINO).
2. N is in position 4 (✓ in ROUND and GRINO).
3. O is in the word but never in position 3 (ROUND) or 5 (GRINO), so O must be in position 1.
4. G is in the word but not in position 1 (GRINO feedback: G(-)), so G must be in position 3 or 4.  
   But position 4 is already N, so G must be in position 3.
5. I is not in the word (GRINO feedback: I(x)).
6. A, S, E, U, D, I are all ruled out.
7. Remaining unused common letters: T, L, C, M, Y, etc.

So the pattern is now fully determined:
- Position 1: O
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: G
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: ?

We need a single letter for position 5 that has not been ruled out and keeps the word valid.  
Available letters (common ones): T, L, C, M, Y.

A common word that fits is “ORGAN” (O-R-G-A-N), but A is already ruled out.  
Next best: “ORGAN” invalid (A), “ORGAM” (not a word), “ORGUN” (invalid), “ORGYN” (invalid).  

The only common word left is “ORGAN” (but A is out), so we must look for another.  
Wait – let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting O-R-G-N-? with remaining letters.

Valid word: “ORGAN” – A is out.  
“ORGAN” fails.  
Next: “ORGUM” (invalid).  
“ORGON” – O-R-G-O-N, but O is already used in position 1 and can’t repeat (Wordle rules don’t forbid repeats, but we have no evidence O repeats).  
“ORGON” is a valid word (a unit of energy in physics).

But let’s check simpler words first.  
“ORGAN” fails.  
“ORGUM” fails.  
“ORGON” seems the only valid word left that fits the pattern and uses allowed letters.

However, “ORGON” uses O twice – we have no evidence against it, but we want to avoid unnecessary repeats.  
Alternative: look for other letters for position 5.  
Available letters: T, L, C, M, Y.

“ORGNT” – invalid.  
“ORGNC” – invalid.  
“ORGNM” – invalid.  
“ORGNY” – invalid.

Actually, the only valid word fitting O-R-G-N-? with remaining letters is “ORGAN” (invalid due to A) and “ORGON” (possible).  
But let’s re-examine: we have O-R-G-N-? and need a valid word.

Upon reflection, the correct word must be “ORGAN” but A is out.  
Therefore, the only remaining valid word is “ORGON”.

But let’s verify:  
O(1) R(2) G(3) N(4) O(5) – this uses O twice, but we have no evidence against it.  
“ORGON” is a valid English word.

However, let’s check if we missed any simpler word.  
Alternative: position 5 could be T, making “ORGNT” – invalid.  
Therefore, the only valid word left is “ORGON”.

But let’s double-check: is there any other word?  
“ORGAN” fails (A).  
“ORGUM” fails.  
“ORGON” is the only valid word.

Therefore, the next guess must be “ORGON”.

But wait – let’s re-examine the constraints carefully.  
We have O-R-G-N-? and need a valid word.  
The only valid word is “ORGON”.

Thus, the next logical guess is:

Let’s update the constraints from all four guesses.

1. R is in position 2 (✓ in AROSE, GRINO, ORGON).
2. N is in position 4 (✓ in ROUND, GRINO, ORGON).
3. O is in the word but:
   - not in position 3 (ROUND)
   - not in position 5 (GRINO)
   - not in position 1 (ORGON)
   Therefore, O must be in position 4, but position 4 is already N.  
   This is a contradiction unless O and N both occupy position 4, which is impossible.

Hence, the only resolution is that O is not in the word at all.  
But this contradicts the earlier feedback that O is in the word (from AROSE and ROUND).

This suggests we must have made an error in interpreting the feedback.  
Re-examining the feedback carefully:

- Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(x)  
  – O is in the word (✓), but position not specified.

- Guess 2: ROUND → R(-) O(-) U(x) N(✓) D(x)  
  – O is in the word but wrong position (-).

- Guess 3: GRINO → G(-) R(✓) I(x) N(✓) O(-)  
  – O is in the word but wrong position (-).

- Guess 4: ORGON → O(-) R(✓) G(-) O(-) N(-)  
  – O is in the word but wrong position (-) for both O’s.

The key is that the first O in ORGON (position 1) was marked (-), meaning O is in the word but not in position 1.  
The second O in ORGON (position 4) was also marked (-), meaning O is in the word but not in position 4.  
Thus, O cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, leaving only position 2.  
But position 2 is R (✓ from earlier).  
This is impossible unless the word contains two O’s, one in position 2 and one elsewhere, but position 2 is R.

This contradiction implies we must have misinterpreted the feedback.  
Rechecking Wordle rules: the feedback symbols apply to the letters in the guess, not necessarily indicating the entire word.  
The feedback for ORGON shows:

- O(-) : first letter O is in word but wrong position (so O is not in position 1).
- R(✓) : second letter R is correct (position 2).
- G(-) : third letter G is in word but wrong position (so G is not in position 3).
- O(-) : fourth letter O is in word but wrong position (so O is not in position 4).
- N(-) : fifth letter N is in word but wrong position (so N is not in position 5).

From this, we now know:
- Position 2 = R (✓)
- Position 4 = N (✓) – but the feedback for N in ORGON was (-), meaning N is in word but not position 5.  
  However, earlier feedback (ROUND) said N is in position 4 (✓).  
  This is consistent: N is in position 4.

So the word pattern is: _ R _ N _

O is in the word but:
- not position 1 (from ORGON first O)
- not position 3 (from ROUND)
- not position 4 (from ORGON second O)
- not position 5 (from GRINO)
Thus, O must be in position 2, but position 2 is R.  
This is impossible unless the word has two O’s, but position 2 is R.

This indicates we must have made an error.  
Re-examining the feedback for ROUND:  
ROUND → R(-) O(-) U(x) N(✓) D(x)  
This means:
- R is in word but not position 1
- O is in word but not position 2
- N is in position 4 (✓)

Similarly, GRINO → G(-) R(✓) I(x) N(✓) O(-)  
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- N is in position 4 (✓)
- O is in word but not position 5

ORGON → O(-) R(✓) G(-) O(-) N(-)  
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- N is in word but not position 5 (consistent with N in position 4)
- O is in word but not position 1 or 4

Thus, O must be in position 3 (since positions 1,2,4,5 are ruled out).  
Therefore, the word pattern is: _ R O N _

Now we need a letter for position 1 that has not been ruled out.  
Ruled-out letters so far: A, S, E, U, D, I, G (from G(-) in GRINO), plus any others used.

Available letters: B, C, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word of the form ? R O N ?.  
Common words: BROWN, CROWN, DROWN (D ruled out), FROWN, GROWN (G ruled out), etc.

Valid options: BROWN, CROWN, FROWN, etc.  
We haven’t tested B, C, or F yet.

Let’s choose CROWN as the next guess.From the feedback we now know:
- Position 2 = R
- Position 4 = N
- Position 3 = O
- Position 1 and 5 are unknown, but we have not yet tested B, C, F, etc.

   Recheck the feedback symbols:  
   - N(-) in CROWN means N is in word but not in position 5.

4. C is not in the word (C(x)).
5. W is in the word but not in position 4 (from W(-) in CROWN).

So far:
- Position 1: unknown, not A, C, S, E, U, D, I, G

Common words:
- BROWN – B and W: W is allowed in position 5 (only W was excluded from position 4).  
- FROWN – F and W: same.  
- GROWN – G already excluded.  
- HROWN – not a word.  
- T R O N ?: T R O N _ – “TRON_” is not a common word.  
- P R O N ?: “PRON_” – “PRONE” has E (excluded), “PRONG” has G (excluded).  

The only valid candidates are BROWN and FROWN.  
Between them, let’s choose BROWN first (B is still possible).

But wait – W in position 5: from CROWN, W(-) means W is in word but not in position 4.  
So W could be in position 5.  
Thus, BROWN is valid.

Let’s confirm:
BROWN → B R O W N  
- R in 2: ✓

- N in 4: ✓ (from ROUND)  
- W in 5: allowed (only position 4 was excluded for W)
