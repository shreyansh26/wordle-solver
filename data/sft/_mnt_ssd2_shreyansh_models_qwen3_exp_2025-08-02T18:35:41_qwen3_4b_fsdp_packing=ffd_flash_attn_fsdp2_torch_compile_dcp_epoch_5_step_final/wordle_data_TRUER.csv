### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This gives us maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the correct position (second letter).
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

1. Keeps R in the second position.
2. Includes E in one of the remaining positions.
3. Avoids A, O, S entirely.
4. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is ""TERED"" (though it's not a valid English word). Instead, let's try ""PERIL"":
- P is a common consonant.
- E in position 1 satisfies the ""E must be present"" constraint.
- R is locked in position 2.
- I and L are common letters not yet tested.

""PERIL"" fits all criteria.

From the new feedback on TREND:
- T is in the correct position (position 1).
- R is in the correct position (position 2).
- E is in the word but NOT in position 3.
- N and D are not in the word.

So the word pattern is now: T R _ _ _

E must appear in position 4 or 5 (since it cannot be in position 3).

Letters already eliminated: A, O, S, P, I, L, N, D.

Remaining common letters to try: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

We need two more letters for positions 3, 4 or 3, 5. Since E must be in 4 or 5, let's try placing E in position 4 and pick common consonants for position 3.

A good candidate is ""TREND"" but N and D are already out. Let's try ""TRECK"":
- T R E C K
- C and K are new letters.
- E is in position 3, but we know E cannot be in position 3 (from PERIL feedback). So this is invalid.

Next, place E in position 5: ""T R _ _ E"". We need a consonant for position 3 and 4. Let's try ""T R I V E"" but I is out. ""T R U C E"" - C and U are new. ""T R U C E"" is valid but not common. ""T R U M P"" - P is out. ""T R I C K"" - I and K are new but I is out.

Better: ""T R U C E"" is valid but might be obscure. ""T R U M P"" - P is out. ""T R U B E"" - B and U are new. ""T R U B E"" is valid.

Alternatively, ""T R E E S"" - S is out. ""T R E V E"" - V is new. ""T R E V E"" is valid.

Another option: ""T R U C K"" - but K is new. ""T R U C K"" is valid.

Let's choose ""TREVE"" (variant spelling of ""trave"" or ""trevor"" but not common). Instead, ""TRECK"" is invalid as E can't be in 3.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E). This gives us maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- R is in the correct position (second letter).
- E is in the word but not in the fifth position.
- A, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word is of the form: _ R _ _ _

And E must appear somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

I want a new word that:
1. Keeps R in the second position.
2. Includes E in one of the remaining positions.
3. Avoids A, O, S entirely.
4. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is ""TERED"" (though it's not a valid English word). Instead, let's try ""PERIL"":
- P is a common consonant.
- E in position 1 satisfies the ""E must be present"" constraint.
- R is locked in position 2.
- I and L are common letters not yet tested.

""PERIL"" fits all criteria.

Guess 2: PERIL -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(-) R(-) I(x) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on PERIL:
- P, I, L are not in the word at all.
- E is still in the word but is NOT in position 2 (since it was marked ""-"" in PERIL).
- R is in the word but is NOT in position 3 (since it was marked ""-"" in PERIL).

Combining with the previous feedback:
- Word pattern: _ R _ _ _
- E must appear in position 1, 3, or 4 (cannot be 2 or 5).
- R is in position 2 (confirmed by AROSE).
- Letters to avoid: A, O, S, P, I, L.

So far:
- Position 2: R
- E must be in 1, 3, or 4
- Other positions must use letters not yet eliminated.

Let's try ""TREND"":
- T, N, D are new letters.
- E is in position 3 (valid).
- R is in position 2 (matches).
- No forbidden letters are used.

This seems like a good third guess.
