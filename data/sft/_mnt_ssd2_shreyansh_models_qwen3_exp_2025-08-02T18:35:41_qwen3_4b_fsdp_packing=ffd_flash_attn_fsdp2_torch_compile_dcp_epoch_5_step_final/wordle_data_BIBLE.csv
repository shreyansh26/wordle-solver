For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This should give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions. 

Another strong candidate would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O, which is very common in 5-letter words. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct (5th) position.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.

Common letters not yet ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I want to test new common letters while avoiding the ruled-out ones. Good candidates would use letters like T, N, L, I, C, D, etc.

A strong second guess should introduce several new common letters. ""UNTIE"" is a good candidate but contains I and T (both good) and ends with E. However, ""UNTIE"" has U, N, T, I, E - but E is already confirmed at position 5. This seems acceptable.

Another good option is ""UNTIE"" since it tests U, N, T, I while keeping E fixed at the end. Alternatively, ""LIGHT"" but it has S (ruled out) in it. ""UNTIE"" seems best.

Wait, let me double-check: AROSE had A, R, O, S ruled out. UNTIE has U, N, T, I, E - none of which are ruled out. This seems perfect.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - Letters A, R, O, S are absent.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓)
   - E is still confirmed at position 5.
   - U, N, T are not in the word at all.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the secret word:
- Ends with E.
- Contains I somewhere in positions 1-3.
- Does NOT contain: A, R, O, S, U, N, T.
- Does NOT contain any of the letters already ruled out.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since I must appear somewhere in positions 1-3, let's try to place it in position 1 or 2 to maximize information. A good word that uses I in position 1 and tests new common letters is ""ICING"":
- I in position 1 (testing if it's correct there).
- C, N, G are new letters (but N is already ruled out, so this is bad).

Wait, N is ruled out. Let me pick a word with I in position 2 instead: ""CLIMB"" - but ends with B, not E. I need to keep E in position 5.

How about ""MIDGE"":
- M, I, D, G, E.
- I in position 2.
- Tests M, D, G which are new.

But ""MIDGE"" is a valid word and fits all constraints.

Another option: ""PICKY"" - but Y is less common and K is okay, but I is in position 3 which might not be optimal.

Actually, ""MIDGE"" seems better as it tests M, D, G in positions 1,3,4 while keeping I in position 2 and E in 5.

But let me think of a word that places I in position 1: ""IVORY"" - but O is ruled out.

""IVORY"" is invalid due to O.

""IVVY"" - but that's 4 letters.

""IVY"" - too short.

""IVY"" is not 5 letters.

""IVORY"" is 5 letters but contains O (ruled out).

So I must place I in position 2 or 3.

Let me try ""CLIMB"" - but ends with B, not E.

""FLICK"" - ends with K.

""PLIKE"" - ends with E, but K is okay, but I is in position 3.

""PLIKE"" - but P, L, I, K, E - all allowed. I is in position 3 (which is allowed since it's not in position 4).

This seems good.

Another option: ""FLICK"" - but ends with K.

""FLICK"" - F, L, I, C, K - all allowed, I in position 3.

""FLICK"" is a valid word.

Between ""MIDGE"" and ""FLICK"", both are good. ""FLICK"" tests F, L, C, K while ""MIDGE"" tests M, D, G.

I'll go with ""FLICK"" as it tests more common letters.

But wait, let me check if any letters in ""FLICK"" are ruled out:
- F: not ruled out

1. Ends with E.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

Common letters not yet ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I want to test new common letters while avoiding the ruled-out ones. Good candidates would use letters like T, N, L, I, C, D, etc.

A strong second guess should introduce several new common letters. ""UNTIE"" is a good candidate but contains I and T (both good) and ends with E. However, ""UNTIE"" has U, N, T, I, E - but E is already confirmed at position 5. This seems acceptable.

Another good option is ""UNTIE"" since it tests U, N, T, I while keeping E fixed at the end. Alternatively, ""LIGHT"" but it has S (ruled out) in it. ""UNTIE"" seems best.

Wait, let me double-check: AROSE had A, R, O, S ruled out. UNTIE has U, N, T, I, E - none of which are ruled out. This seems perfect.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - Letters A, R, O, S are absent.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓)
   - E is still confirmed at position 5.
   - U, N, T are not in the word at all.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the secret word:
- Ends with E.
- Contains I somewhere in positions 1-3.
- Does NOT contain: A, R, O, S, U, N, T.
- Does NOT contain any of the letters already ruled out.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since I must appear somewhere in positions 1-3, let's try to place it in position 1 or 2 to maximize information. A good word that uses I in position 1 and tests new common letters is ""ICING"":
- I in position 1 (testing if it's correct there).
- C, N, G are new letters (but N is already ruled out, so this is bad).

Wait, N is ruled out. Let me pick a word with I in position 2 instead: ""CLIMB"" - but ends with B, not E. I need to keep E in position 5.

How about ""MIDGE"":
- M, I, D, G, E.
- I in position 2.
- Tests M, D, G which are new.

But ""MIDGE"" is a valid word and fits all constraints.

Another option: ""PICKY"" - but Y is less common and K is okay, but I is in position 3 which might not be optimal.

Actually, ""MIDGE"" seems better as it tests M, D, G in positions 1,3,4 while keeping I in position 2 and E in 5.

But let me think of a word that places I in position 1: ""IVORY"" - but O is ruled out.

""IVORY"" is invalid due to O.

""IVVY"" - but that's 4 letters.

""IVY"" - too short.

""IVY"" is not 5 letters.

""IVORY"" is 5 letters but contains O (ruled out).

So I must place I in position 2 or 3.

Let me try ""CLIMB"" - but ends with B, not E.

""FLICK"" - ends with K.

""PLIKE"" - ends with E, but K is okay, but I is in position 3.

""PLIKE"" - but P, L, I, K, E - all allowed. I is in position 3 (which is allowed since it's not in position 4).

This seems good.

Another option: ""FLICK"" - but ends with K.

""FLICK"" - F, L, I, C, K - all allowed, I in position 3.

""FLICK"" is a valid word.

Between ""MIDGE"" and ""FLICK"", both are good. ""FLICK"" tests F, L, C, K while ""MIDGE"" tests M, D, G.

I'll go with ""FLICK"" as it tests more common letters.

But wait, let me check if any letters in ""FLICK"" are ruled out:
- F: not ruled out
- L: not ruled out
- I: allowed
- C: not ruled out
- K: not ruled out

Yes, all are allowed.

So the next guess is ""FLICK"".

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. E is locked in position 5.
2. I is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (because in UNTIE it was in position 4 and got “-”, and in FLICK it was in position 3 and also got “-”).
3. Therefore I must be in position 1.
4. Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, F, C, K.
5. Remaining candidate letters (besides the already-confirmed E and the known I): B, D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with I (because I must be in position 1).
- Ends with E.
- Uses only letters from the remaining set (no A, R, O, S, U, N, T, F, C, K).
- Must be a valid English word.

Looking at common words that fit I _ _ _ E, a good candidate is “IDEAL” but A is ruled out.  
“IGLOO” has O (ruled out).  
“IMPEL” has P and L, but L is allowed and P is allowed.  
Wait, let’s list possible letters for positions 2-4: B, D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A simple word that fits: “IMPEL” – but L is allowed (not ruled out).  
But we must check if any letters are ruled out. L was in FLICK and got “-”, which only means it’s not in position 3, not that it’s absent. So L is allowed.

But let’s pick a word that tests new letters efficiently.  
“IMPEL” tests M, P, L.  
Another option: “IGLOB” – but B is allowed.  
Actually, “IMPEL” is valid.

However, let’s try to test more letters.  
“IDYLL” – but Y is allowed.  
But “IDYLL” has L which is allowed.

But let’s pick a word that uses distinct new letters.  
“IMPEL” uses I, M, P, E, L.  
That seems good.

But let’s double-check:  
- I: allowed in position 1.  
- M: allowed.  
- P: allowed.  
- E: fixed in position 5.  
- L: allowed (only position 3 was tested in FLICK, but that was “-”, not “x”).  

So “IMPEL” is valid.

But let’s see if we can test more letters.  
“IVVY” is too short.  
“IVORY” has O (ruled out).  
“IVY” is too short.  

Another candidate: “IDYLL” – I, D, Y, L, L.  
But double L is okay, and D, Y, L are allowed.  

But let’s pick “IMPEL” as it tests M, P, L.

But let’s think differently: we need a word that starts with I, ends with E, and uses letters not yet ruled out.  
“IDEAL” – A ruled out.  
“IGLOO” – O ruled out.  
“IMPEL” – seems okay.  
“IVORY” – O ruled out.  
“IVY” – too short.  
“INSET” – N, S, T ruled out.  
“INVEE” – not a word.  
“IVVY” – too short.  

Actually, “IMPEL” is valid.  
But let’s see if we can find a word with distinct letters.  
“IMPEL” uses I, M, P, E, L.  
Another option: “IGLOB” – but B is allowed.  
“IGLOB” is not a common word.  

“IMPEL” seems the best.

But let’s check “IMPEL” against the constraints:
- Starts with I (position 1).  
- Ends with E (position 5).  
- Letters used: I, M, P, E, L.  
All letters except E are allowed (none are in the ruled-out list).  

Therefore, “IMPEL” is a valid next guess.

But let’s think if there’s a better word.  
“IMPEL” is good, but let’s try “IMPEL” or “IMPEL”.

Actually, let’s pick “IMPEL” as it tests M, P, L.

But let’s see another word: “IDYLL” – I, D, Y, L, L.  
D and Y are allowed.  

But “IMPEL” seems more informative.  

Final choice: “IMPEL”.

But let me re-express:

We know:
- Word form: I _ _ _ E
- Allowed letters for positions 2-4: B, D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- We want to test as many new letters as possible.

A good word is “IMPEL” (I M P E L) – but it ends with L, not E.  
Wait, no: “IMPEL” is I M P E L, which ends with L, not E.  
This is wrong.

I need a word that starts with I and ends with E.  
So form: I _ _ _ E.

Possible words:
- I _ _ _ E

Looking at the remaining letters, possible combinations:

I B _ _ E – “IBBLE” – but B is allowed, but “IBBLE” is not a word.  
I D _ _ E – “IDYLL” – I D Y L L – but Y and L are allowed.  
I M _ _ E – “IMBEE” – not a word.  
I P _ _ E – “IPPEE” – not a word.  
I V _ _ E – “IVE” – too short.  
I G _ _ E – “IGGIE” – but G is allowed.  

“IDYLL” is a valid word meaning a pastoral village or a lyrical poem, and it fits I D Y L L, ending with L, but we need to end with E.  
So that’s not it.

Wait, I need I _ _ _ E.

Let me think of actual 5-letter words starting with I and ending with E:

- I _ _ _ E

Possible valid words:
- ILLIE – but L is allowed, but this is obscure.  
- IVY – too short.  
- IGLOO – ends with O.  
- IMPEL – ends with L.  
- INSET – ends with T (ruled out).  
- INVEE – not a word.  
- IRATE – ends with E, but A is ruled out.  
- IRONY – ends with Y.  
- IRATE – A ruled out.  
- IRISE – ends with E, but R is ruled out.  
- IRRIT – ends with T.  
- ISLE – too short.  
- ISLET – ends with T.  
- ITALY – ends with Y.  
- ITCHY – ends with Y.  
- ITALY – ends with Y.  
- IVORY – ends with Y.  
- IVY – too short.  

Actually, there are very few common 5-letter words starting with I and ending with E, given the ruled-out letters.  
The most common seem to be:

- IRATE – A ruled out.  
- IRONY – ends with Y.  
- IRIS – too short.  
- IRATE – A ruled out.  
- IRRIT – ends with T.  
- ISLET – ends with T.  
- ISLE – too short.  
- ITALY – ends with Y.  
- ITCHY – ends with Y.  
- IVORY – ends with Y.  
- IGLOO – ends with O.  
- IMPEL – ends with L.  

It appears that the only viable candidate is “IMPEL” but it ends with L, not E.  
Wait, I must have missed something.  

Let me list all 5-letter English words starting with I and ending with E:

1. ILLIE  
2. IRATE  
3. IRIS (but 4 letters)  
4. IRONY  
5. IRRIT  
6. ISLET  
7. ISLE (but 4 letters)  
8. ITALY  
9. ITCHY  
10. IVORY  
11. IGLOO  
12. IMPEL  

From these, the ones that fit our constraints (no A, R, O, S, U, N, T, F, C, K) are:

- ILLIE – uses I, L, L, I, E – but L is allowed, and I is allowed.  
- IRATE – A ruled out.  
- IRONY – ends with Y.  
- IRRIT – ends with T.  
- ISLET – ends with T.  
- ISLE – too short.  
- ITALY – ends with Y.  
- ITCHY – ends with Y.  
- IVORY – ends with Y.  
- IGLOO – ends with O.  
- IMPEL – ends with L.  

The only valid word left seems to be “ILLIE”, but it repeats letters and is quite obscure.  

However, let me reconsider: the feedback only told us I is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.  
Therefore I could be in position 1, 2, or 3, but we already eliminated positions 2 and 3 for I.  
Thus I must be in position 1.  

Therefore the word must start with I and end with E.  
Given the ruled-out letters, the only remaining candidate is “ILLIE”, but it’s obscure.  

But let me check if there are any other words.  
“IDYLL” – ends with L, not E.  
“IGLOB” – ends with B, not E.  

Actually, the only common word left is “IRATE”, but A is ruled out.  

This suggests that the word must be something like “ILLIE” or “IMBEE” (but not valid).  

Given this, the most plausible word is “ILLIE”, even if it’s obscure.  

But let me double-check the constraints:

- Starts with I (position 1).  
- Ends with E (position 5).  
- Uses only allowed letters: I, L, L, I, E – all allowed.  

Therefore, “ILLIE” is a valid guess.

But let me see if there’s a better word.  
“IMPEL” is invalid because it ends with L.  

Another possibility: “IVVIE” – but V is allowed, but this is not a word.  

Given the constraints, “ILLIE” seems to be the only valid 5-letter word starting with I and ending with E that uses only allowed letters.  

However, let me re-examine the feedback:

From FLICK: F(x) L(-) I(-) C(x) K(x)

- L was in position 2 in FLICK and got “-”, which means L is in the word but not in position 2.  
Therefore L could be in positions 3 or 4.  

Similarly, I was in position 3 in FLICK and got “-”, but we already determined I must be in position 1.  

Thus, the word must be I _ _ _ E, with L somewhere in positions 3 or 4, and other letters from the remaining set.  

A valid word fitting this is “IMBLE” – but this is not a word.  

Another: “IDYLE” – but Y is allowed, and this is a valid word (a simple melody or tune).  

“IDYLE” – I, D, Y, L, E.  
- I in position 1 (required).  
- Ends with E.  
- Letters used: I, D, Y, L, E – all allowed.  

This seems to fit perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess is “IDYLE”.
</think>

Based on the accumulated information:
- E is fixed in position 5.
- I must be in position 1 (since it cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4).
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (from FLICK feedback).
- Remaining letters to test: D, Y, etc.

The word must be I _ _ _ E with L somewhere in positions 3 or 4. A valid English word fitting this is ""IDYLE"".

<guess>IDYLE</guess>",IDYLE,"Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. E is locked in position 5.
2. I is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (because in UNTIE it was in position 4 and got “-”, and in FLICK it was in position 3 and also got “-”).
3. Therefore I must be in position 1.
4. Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, F, C, K.
5. Remaining candidate letters (besides the already-confirmed E and the known I): B, D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with I (because I must be in position 1).
- Ends with E.
- Uses only letters from the remaining set (no A, R, O, S, U, N, T, F, C, K).
- Must be a valid English word.

Looking at common words that fit I _ _ _ E, a good candidate is “IDEAL” but A is ruled out.  
“IGLOO” has O (ruled out).  
“IMPEL” has P and L, but L is allowed and P is allowed.  
Wait, let’s list possible letters for positions 2-4: B, D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A simple word that fits: “IMPEL” – but L is allowed (not ruled out).  
But we must check if any letters are ruled out. L was in FLICK and got “-”, which only means it’s not in position 3, not that it’s absent. So L is allowed.

But let’s pick a word that tests new letters efficiently.  
“IMPEL” tests M, P, L.  
Another option: “IGLOB” – but B is allowed.  
Actually, “IMPEL” is valid.

However, let’s try to test more letters.  
“IDYLL” – but Y is allowed.  
But “IDYLL” has L which is allowed.

But let’s pick a word that uses distinct new letters.  
“IMPEL” uses I, M, P, E, L.  
That seems good.

But let’s double-check:  
- I: allowed in position 1.  
- M: allowed.  
- P: allowed.  
- E: fixed in position 5.  
- L: allowed (only position 3 was tested in FLICK, but that was “-”, not “x”).  

So “IMPEL” is valid.

But let’s see if we can test more letters.  
“IVVY” is too short.  
“IVORY” has O (ruled out).  
“IVY” is too short.  

Another candidate: “IDYLL” – I, D, Y, L, L.  
But double L is okay, and D, Y, L are allowed.  

But let’s pick “IMPEL” as it tests M, P, L.

But let’s think differently: we need a word that starts with I, ends with E, and uses letters not yet ruled out.  
“IDEAL” – A ruled out.  
“IGLOO” – O ruled out.  
“IMPEL” – seems okay.  
“IVORY” – O ruled out.  
“IVY” – too short.  
“INSET” – N, S, T ruled out.  
“INVEE” – not a word.  
“IVVY” – too short.  

Actually, “IMPEL” is valid.  
But let’s see if we can find a word with distinct letters.  
“IMPEL” uses I, M, P, E, L.  
Another option: “IGLOB” – but B is allowed.  
“IGLOB” is not a common word.  

“IMPEL” seems the best.

But let’s check “IMPEL” against the constraints:
- Starts with I (position 1).  
- Ends with E (position 5).  
- Letters used: I, M, P, E, L.  
All letters except E are allowed (none are in the ruled-out list).  

Therefore, “IMPEL” is a valid next guess.

But let’s think if there’s a better word.  
“IMPEL” is good, but let’s try “IMPEL” or “IMPEL”.

Actually, let’s pick “IMPEL” as it tests M, P, L.

But let’s see another word: “IDYLL” – I, D, Y, L, L.  
D and Y are allowed.  

But “IMPEL” seems more informative.  

Final choice: “IMPEL”.

But let me re-express:

We know:
- Word form: I _ _ _ E
- Allowed letters for positions 2-4: B, D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- We want to test as many new letters as possible.

A good word is “IMPEL” (I M P E L) – but it ends with L, not E.  
Wait, no: “IMPEL” is I M P E L, which ends with L, not E.  
This is wrong.

I need a word that starts with I and ends with E.  
So form: I _ _ _ E.

Possible words:
- I _ _ _ E

Looking at the remaining letters, possible combinations:

I B _ _ E – “IBBLE” – but B is allowed, but “IBBLE” is not a word.  
I D _ _ E – “IDYLL” – I D Y L L – but Y and L are allowed.  
I M _ _ E – “IMBEE” – not a word.  
I P _ _ E – “IPPEE” – not a word.  
I V _ _ E – “IVE” – too short.  
I G _ _ E – “IGGIE” – but G is allowed.  

“IDYLL” is a valid word meaning a pastoral village or a lyrical poem, and it fits I D Y L L, ending with L, but we need to end with E.  
So that’s not it.

Wait, I need I _ _ _ E.

Let me think of actual 5-letter words starting with I and ending with E:

- I _ _ _ E

Possible valid words:
- ILLIE – but L is allowed, but this is obscure.  
- IVY – too short.  
- IGLOO – ends with O.  
- IMPEL – ends with L.  
- INSET – ends with T (ruled out).  
- INVEE – not a word.  
- IRATE – ends with E, but A is ruled out.  
- IRONY – ends with Y.  
- IRATE – A ruled out.  
- IRISE – ends with E, but R is ruled out.  
- IRRIT – ends with T.  
- ISLE – too short.  
- ISLET – ends with T.  
- ITALY – ends with Y.  
- ITCHY – ends with Y.  
- ITALY – ends with Y.  
- IVORY – ends with Y.  
- IVY – too short.  

Actually, there are very few common 5-letter words starting with I and ending with E, given the ruled-out letters.  
The most common seem to be:

- IRATE – A ruled out.  
- IRONY – ends with Y.  
- IRIS – too short.  
- IRATE – A ruled out.  
- IRRIT – ends with T.  
- ISLET – ends with T.  
- ISLE – too short.  
- ITALY – ends with Y.  
- ITCHY – ends with Y.  
- IVORY – ends with Y.  
- IGLOO – ends with O.  
- IMPEL – ends with L.  

It appears that the only viable candidate is “IMPEL” but it ends with L, not E.  
Wait, I must have missed something.  

Let me list all 5-letter English words starting with I and ending with E:

1. ILLIE  
2. IRATE  
3. IRIS (but 4 letters)  
4. IRONY  
5. IRRIT  
6. ISLET  
7. ISLE (but 4 letters)  
8. ITALY  
9. ITCHY  
10. IVORY  
11. IGLOO  
12. IMPEL  

From these, the ones that fit our constraints (no A, R, O, S, U, N, T, F, C, K) are:

- ILLIE – uses I, L, L, I, E – but L is allowed, and I is allowed.  
- IRATE – A ruled out.  
- IRONY – ends with Y.  
- IRRIT – ends with T.  
- ISLET – ends with T.  
- ISLE – too short.  
- ITALY – ends with Y.  
- ITCHY – ends with Y.  
- IVORY – ends with Y.  
- IGLOO – ends with O.  
- IMPEL – ends with L.  

The only valid word left seems to be “ILLIE”, but it repeats letters and is quite obscure.  

However, let me reconsider: the feedback only told us I is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.  
Therefore I could be in position 1, 2, or 3, but we already eliminated positions 2 and 3 for I.  
Thus I must be in position 1.  

Therefore the word must start with I and end with E.  
Given the ruled-out letters, the only remaining candidate is “ILLIE”, but it’s obscure.  

But let me check if there are any other words.  
“IDYLL” – ends with L, not E.  
“IGLOB” – ends with B, not E.  

Actually, the only common word left is “IRATE”, but A is ruled out.  

This suggests that the word must be something like “ILLIE” or “IMBEE” (but not valid).  

Given this, the most plausible word is “ILLIE”, even if it’s obscure.  

But let me double-check the constraints:

- Starts with I (position 1).  
- Ends with E (position 5).  
- Uses only allowed letters: I, L, L, I, E – all allowed.  

Therefore, “ILLIE” is a valid guess.

But let me see if there’s a better word.  
“IMPEL” is invalid because it ends with L.  

Another possibility: “IVVIE” – but V is allowed, but this is not a word.  

Given the constraints, “ILLIE” seems to be the only valid 5-letter word starting with I and ending with E that uses only allowed letters.  

However, let me re-examine the feedback:

From FLICK: F(x) L(-) I(-) C(x) K(x)

- L was in position 2 in FLICK and got “-”, which means L is in the word but not in position 2.  
Therefore L could be in positions 3 or 4.  

Similarly, I was in position 3 in FLICK and got “-”, but we already determined I must be in position 1.  

Thus, the word must be I _ _ _ E, with L somewhere in positions 3 or 4, and other letters from the remaining set.  

A valid word fitting this is “IMBLE” – but this is not a word.  

Another: “IDYLE” – but Y is allowed, and this is a valid word (a simple melody or tune).  

“IDYLE” – I, D, Y, L, E.  
- I in position 1 (required).  
- Ends with E.  
- Letters used: I, D, Y, L, E – all allowed.  

This seems to fit perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess is “IDYLE”.Based on the accumulated information:
- E is fixed in position 5.
- I must be in position 1 (since it cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4).
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (from FLICK feedback).
- Remaining letters to test: D, Y, etc.

The word must be I _ _ _ E with L somewhere in positions 3 or 4. A valid English word fitting this is ""IDYLE"".",Guess 4: IDYLE -> FEEDBACK: I(-) D(x) Y(x) L(✓) E(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This should give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions. 

Another strong candidate would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O, which is very common in 5-letter words. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct (5th) position.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.

Next, I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

Common letters not yet ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I want to test new common letters while avoiding the ruled-out ones. Good candidates would use letters like T, N, L, I, C, D, etc.

A strong second guess should introduce several new common letters. ""UNTIE"" is a good candidate but contains I and T (both good) and ends with E. However, ""UNTIE"" has U, N, T, I, E - but E is already confirmed at position 5. This seems acceptable.

Another good option is ""UNTIE"" since it tests U, N, T, I while keeping E fixed at the end. Alternatively, ""LIGHT"" but it has S (ruled out) in it. ""UNTIE"" seems best.

Wait, let me double-check: AROSE had A, R, O, S ruled out. UNTIE has U, N, T, I, E - none of which are ruled out. This seems perfect.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: UNTIE -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - Letters A, R, O, S are absent.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓)
   - E is still confirmed at position 5.
   - U, N, T are not in the word at all.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the secret word:
- Ends with E.
- Contains I somewhere in positions 1-3.
- Does NOT contain: A, R, O, S, U, N, T.
- Does NOT contain any of the letters already ruled out.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since I must appear somewhere in positions 1-3, let's try to place it in position 1 or 2 to maximize information. A good word that uses I in position 1 and tests new common letters is ""ICING"":
- I in position 1 (testing if it's correct there).
- C, N, G are new letters (but N is already ruled out, so this is bad).

Wait, N is ruled out. Let me pick a word with I in position 2 instead: ""CLIMB"" - but ends with B, not E. I need to keep E in position 5.

How about ""MIDGE"":
- M, I, D, G, E.
- I in position 2.
- Tests M, D, G which are new.

But ""MIDGE"" is a valid word and fits all constraints.

Another option: ""PICKY"" - but Y is less common and K is okay, but I is in position 3 which might not be optimal.

Actually, ""MIDGE"" seems better as it tests M, D, G in positions 1,3,4 while keeping I in position 2 and E in 5.

But let me think of a word that places I in position 1: ""IVORY"" - but O is ruled out.

""IVORY"" is invalid due to O.

""IVVY"" - but that's 4 letters.

""IVY"" - too short.

""IVY"" is not 5 letters.

""IVORY"" is 5 letters but contains O (ruled out).

So I must place I in position 2 or 3.

Let me try ""CLIMB"" - but ends with B, not E.

""FLICK"" - ends with K.

""PLIKE"" - ends with E, but K is okay, but I is in position 3.

""PLIKE"" - but P, L, I, K, E - all allowed. I is in position 3 (which is allowed since it's not in position 4).

This seems good.

Another option: ""FLICK"" - but ends with K.

""FLICK"" - F, L, I, C, K - all allowed, I in position 3.

""FLICK"" is a valid word.

Between ""MIDGE"" and ""FLICK"", both are good. ""FLICK"" tests F, L, C, K while ""MIDGE"" tests M, D, G.

I'll go with ""FLICK"" as it tests more common letters.

But wait, let me check if any letters in ""FLICK"" are ruled out:
- F: not ruled out
- L: not ruled out
- I: allowed
- C: not ruled out
- K: not ruled out

Yes, all are allowed.

So the next guess is ""FLICK"".

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. E is locked in position 5.
2. I is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (because in UNTIE it was in position 4 and got “-”, and in FLICK it was in position 3 and also got “-”).
3. Therefore I must be in position 1.
4. Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, F, C, K.
5. Remaining candidate letters (besides the already-confirmed E and the known I): B, D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with I (because I must be in position 1).
- Ends with E.
- Uses only letters from the remaining set (no A, R, O, S, U, N, T, F, C, K).
- Must be a valid English word.

Looking at common words that fit I _ _ _ E, a good candidate is “IDEAL” but A is ruled out.  
“IGLOO” has O (ruled out).  
“IMPEL” has P and L, but L is allowed and P is allowed.  
Wait, let’s list possible letters for positions 2-4: B, D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A simple word that fits: “IMPEL” – but L is allowed (not ruled out).  
But we must check if any letters are ruled out. L was in FLICK and got “-”, which only means it’s not in position 3, not that it’s absent. So L is allowed.

But let’s pick a word that tests new letters efficiently.  
“IMPEL” tests M, P, L.  
Another option: “IGLOB” – but B is allowed.  
Actually, “IMPEL” is valid.

However, let’s try to test more letters.  
“IDYLL” – but Y is allowed.  
But “IDYLL” has L which is allowed.

But let’s pick a word that uses distinct new letters.  
“IMPEL” uses I, M, P, E, L.  
That seems good.

But let’s double-check:  
- I: allowed in position 1.  
- M: allowed.  
- P: allowed.  
- E: fixed in position 5.  
- L: allowed (only position 3 was tested in FLICK, but that was “-”, not “x”).  

So “IMPEL” is valid.

But let’s see if we can test more letters.  
“IVVY” is too short.  
“IVORY” has O (ruled out).  
“IVY” is too short.  

Another candidate: “IDYLL” – I, D, Y, L, L.  
But double L is okay, and D, Y, L are allowed.  

But let’s pick “IMPEL” as it tests M, P, L.

But let’s think differently: we need a word that starts with I, ends with E, and uses letters not yet ruled out.  
“IDEAL” – A ruled out.  
“IGLOO” – O ruled out.  
“IMPEL” – seems okay.  
“IVORY” – O ruled out.  
“IVY” – too short.  
“INSET” – N, S, T ruled out.  
“INVEE” – not a word.  
“IVVY” – too short.  

Actually, “IMPEL” is valid.  
But let’s see if we can find a word with distinct letters.  
“IMPEL” uses I, M, P, E, L.  
Another option: “IGLOB” – but B is allowed.  
“IGLOB” is not a common word.  

“IMPEL” seems the best.

But let’s check “IMPEL” against the constraints:
- Starts with I (position 1).  
- Ends with E (position 5).  
- Letters used: I, M, P, E, L.  
All letters except E are allowed (none are in the ruled-out list).  

Therefore, “IMPEL” is a valid next guess.

But let’s think if there’s a better word.  
“IMPEL” is good, but let’s try “IMPEL” or “IMPEL”.

Actually, let’s pick “IMPEL” as it tests M, P, L.

But let’s see another word: “IDYLL” – I, D, Y, L, L.  
D and Y are allowed.  

But “IMPEL” seems more informative.  

Final choice: “IMPEL”.

But let me re-express:

We know:
- Word form: I _ _ _ E
- Allowed letters for positions 2-4: B, D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- We want to test as many new letters as possible.

A good word is “IMPEL” (I M P E L) – but it ends with L, not E.  
Wait, no: “IMPEL” is I M P E L, which ends with L, not E.  
This is wrong.

I need a word that starts with I and ends with E.  
So form: I _ _ _ E.

Possible words:
- I _ _ _ E

Looking at the remaining letters, possible combinations:

I B _ _ E – “IBBLE” – but B is allowed, but “IBBLE” is not a word.  
I D _ _ E – “IDYLL” – I D Y L L – but Y and L are allowed.  
I M _ _ E – “IMBEE” – not a word.  
I P _ _ E – “IPPEE” – not a word.  
I V _ _ E – “IVE” – too short.  
I G _ _ E – “IGGIE” – but G is allowed.  

“IDYLL” is a valid word meaning a pastoral village or a lyrical poem, and it fits I D Y L L, ending with L, but we need to end with E.  
So that’s not it.

Wait, I need I _ _ _ E.

Let me think of actual 5-letter words starting with I and ending with E:

- I _ _ _ E

Possible valid words:
- ILLIE – but L is allowed, but this is obscure.  
- IVY – too short.  
- IGLOO – ends with O.  
- IMPEL – ends with L.  
- INSET – ends with T (ruled out).  
- INVEE – not a word.  
- IRATE – ends with E, but A is ruled out.  
- IRONY – ends with Y.  
- IRATE – A ruled out.  
- IRISE – ends with E, but R is ruled out.  
- IRRIT – ends with T.  
- ISLE – too short.  
- ISLET – ends with T.  
- ITALY – ends with Y.  
- ITCHY – ends with Y.  
- ITALY – ends with Y.  
- IVORY – ends with Y.  
- IVY – too short.  

Actually, there are very few common 5-letter words starting with I and ending with E, given the ruled-out letters.  
The most common seem to be:

- IRATE – A ruled out.  
- IRONY – ends with Y.  
- IRIS – too short.  
- IRATE – A ruled out.  
- IRRIT – ends with T.  
- ISLET – ends with T.  
- ISLE – too short.  
- ITALY – ends with Y.  
- ITCHY – ends with Y.  
- IVORY – ends with Y.  
- IGLOO – ends with O.  
- IMPEL – ends with L.  

It appears that the only viable candidate is “IMPEL” but it ends with L, not E.  
Wait, I must have missed something.  

Let me list all 5-letter English words starting with I and ending with E:

1. ILLIE  
2. IRATE  
3. IRIS (but 4 letters)  
4. IRONY  
5. IRRIT  
6. ISLET  
7. ISLE (but 4 letters)  
8. ITALY  
9. ITCHY  
10. IVORY  
11. IGLOO  
12. IMPEL  

From these, the ones that fit our constraints (no A, R, O, S, U, N, T, F, C, K) are:

- ILLIE – uses I, L, L, I, E – but L is allowed, and I is allowed.  
- IRATE – A ruled out.  
- IRONY – ends with Y.  
- IRRIT – ends with T.  
- ISLET – ends with T.  
- ISLE – too short.  
- ITALY – ends with Y.  
- ITCHY – ends with Y.  
- IVORY – ends with Y.  
- IGLOO – ends with O.  
- IMPEL – ends with L.  

The only valid word left seems to be “ILLIE”, but it repeats letters and is quite obscure.  

However, let me reconsider: the feedback only told us I is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.  
Therefore I could be in position 1, 2, or 3, but we already eliminated positions 2 and 3 for I.  
Thus I must be in position 1.  

Therefore the word must start with I and end with E.  
Given the ruled-out letters, the only remaining candidate is “ILLIE”, but it’s obscure.  

But let me check if there are any other words.  
“IDYLL” – ends with L, not E.  
“IGLOB” – ends with B, not E.  

Actually, the only common word left is “IRATE”, but A is ruled out.  

This suggests that the word must be something like “ILLIE” or “IMBEE” (but not valid).  

Given this, the most plausible word is “ILLIE”, even if it’s obscure.  

But let me double-check the constraints:

- Starts with I (position 1).  
- Ends with E (position 5).  
- Uses only allowed letters: I, L, L, I, E – all allowed.  

Therefore, “ILLIE” is a valid guess.

But let me see if there’s a better word.  
“IMPEL” is invalid because it ends with L.  

Another possibility: “IVVIE” – but V is allowed, but this is not a word.  

Given the constraints, “ILLIE” seems to be the only valid 5-letter word starting with I and ending with E that uses only allowed letters.  

However, let me re-examine the feedback:

From FLICK: F(x) L(-) I(-) C(x) K(x)

- L was in position 2 in FLICK and got “-”, which means L is in the word but not in position 2.  
Therefore L could be in positions 3 or 4.  

Similarly, I was in position 3 in FLICK and got “-”, but we already determined I must be in position 1.  

Thus, the word must be I _ _ _ E, with L somewhere in positions 3 or 4, and other letters from the remaining set.  

A valid word fitting this is “IMBLE” – but this is not a word.  

Another: “IDYLE” – but Y is allowed, and this is a valid word (a simple melody or tune).  

“IDYLE” – I, D, Y, L, E.  
- I in position 1 (required).  
- Ends with E.  
- Letters used: I, D, Y, L, E – all allowed.  

This seems to fit perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess is “IDYLE”.Based on the accumulated information:
- E is fixed in position 5.
- I must be in position 1 (since it cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4).
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (from FLICK feedback).
- Remaining letters to test: D, Y, etc.

The word must be I _ _ _ E with L somewhere in positions 3 or 4. A valid English word fitting this is ""IDYLE"".

This should give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions. \n\nAnother strong candidate would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O, which is very common in 5-letter words.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with these letters to maximize information gain. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This should give us good coverage to determine which letters are in the word and their possible positions. 

Another strong candidate would be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems slightly better due to the inclusion of O, which is very common in 5-letter words. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- E is in the word and in the correct (5th) position.
- A, R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends with E and contains none of A, R, O, S.

Next, I need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, S.

Common letters not yet ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

I want to test new common letters while avoiding the ruled-out ones. Good candidates would use letters like T, N, L, I, C, D, etc.

A strong second guess should introduce several new common letters. ""UNTIE"" is a good candidate but contains I and T (both good) and ends with E. However, ""UNTIE"" has U, N, T, I, E - but E is already confirmed at position 5. This seems acceptable.

Another good option is ""UNTIE"" since it tests U, N, T, I while keeping E fixed at the end. Alternatively, ""LIGHT"" but it has S (ruled out) in it. ""UNTIE"" seems best.

Wait, let me double-check: AROSE had A, R, O, S ruled out. UNTIE has U, N, T, I, E - none of which are ruled out. This seems perfect.

From the two guesses so far:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - Letters A, R, O, S are absent.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓)
   - E is still confirmed at position 5.
   - U, N, T are not in the word at all.
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So the secret word:
- Ends with E.
- Contains I somewhere in positions 1-3.
- Does NOT contain: A, R, O, S, U, N, T.
- Does NOT contain any of the letters already ruled out.

Remaining common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since I must appear somewhere in positions 1-3, let's try to place it in position 1 or 2 to maximize information. A good word that uses I in position 1 and tests new common letters is ""ICING"":
- I in position 1 (testing if it's correct there).
- C, N, G are new letters (but N is already ruled out, so this is bad).

Wait, N is ruled out. Let me pick a word with I in position 2 instead: ""CLIMB"" - but ends with B, not E. I need to keep E in position 5.

How about ""MIDGE"":
- M, I, D, G, E.
- I in position 2.
- Tests M, D, G which are new.

But ""MIDGE"" is a valid word and fits all constraints.

Another option: ""PICKY"" - but Y is less common and K is okay, but I is in position 3 which might not be optimal.

Actually, ""MIDGE"" seems better as it tests M, D, G in positions 1,3,4 while keeping I in position 2 and E in 5.

But let me think of a word that places I in position 1: ""IVORY"" - but O is ruled out.

""IVORY"" is invalid due to O.

""IVVY"" - but that's 4 letters.

""IVY"" - too short.

""IVY"" is not 5 letters.

""IVORY"" is 5 letters but contains O (ruled out).

So I must place I in position 2 or 3.

Let me try ""CLIMB"" - but ends with B, not E.

""FLICK"" - ends with K.

""PLIKE"" - ends with E, but K is okay, but I is in position 3.

""PLIKE"" - but P, L, I, K, E - all allowed. I is in position 3 (which is allowed since it's not in position 4).

This seems good.

Another option: ""FLICK"" - but ends with K.

""FLICK"" - F, L, I, C, K - all allowed, I in position 3.

""FLICK"" is a valid word.

Between ""MIDGE"" and ""FLICK"", both are good. ""FLICK"" tests F, L, C, K while ""MIDGE"" tests M, D, G.

I'll go with ""FLICK"" as it tests more common letters.

But wait, let me check if any letters in ""FLICK"" are ruled out:
- F: not ruled out
- L: not ruled out
- I: allowed
- C: not ruled out
- K: not ruled out

Yes, all are allowed.

So the next guess is ""FLICK"".

Let’s consolidate everything we now know.

1. E is locked in position 5.
2. I is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (because in UNTIE it was in position 4 and got “-”, and in FLICK it was in position 3 and also got “-”).
3. Therefore I must be in position 1.
4. Letters ruled out so far: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, F, C, K.
5. Remaining candidate letters (besides the already-confirmed E and the known I): B, D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with I (because I must be in position 1).
- Ends with E.
- Uses only letters from the remaining set (no A, R, O, S, U, N, T, F, C, K).
- Must be a valid English word.

Looking at common words that fit I _ _ _ E, a good candidate is “IDEAL” but A is ruled out.  
“IGLOO” has O (ruled out).  
“IMPEL” has P and L, but L is allowed and P is allowed.  
Wait, let’s list possible letters for positions 2-4: B, D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A simple word that fits: “IMPEL” – but L is allowed (not ruled out).  
But we must check if any letters are ruled out. L was in FLICK and got “-”, which only means it’s not in position 3, not that it’s absent. So L is allowed.

But let’s pick a word that tests new letters efficiently.  
“IMPEL” tests M, P, L.  
Another option: “IGLOB” – but B is allowed.  
Actually, “IMPEL” is valid.

However, let’s try to test more letters.  
“IDYLL” – but Y is allowed.  
But “IDYLL” has L which is allowed.

But let’s pick a word that uses distinct new letters.  
“IMPEL” uses I, M, P, E, L.  
That seems good.

But let’s double-check:  
- I: allowed in position 1.  
- M: allowed.  
- P: allowed.  
- E: fixed in position 5.  
- L: allowed (only position 3 was tested in FLICK, but that was “-”, not “x”).  

So “IMPEL” is valid.

But let’s see if we can test more letters.  
“IVVY” is too short.  
“IVORY” has O (ruled out).  
“IVY” is too short.  

Another candidate: “IDYLL” – I, D, Y, L, L.  
But double L is okay, and D, Y, L are allowed.  

But let’s pick “IMPEL” as it tests M, P, L.

But let’s think differently: we need a word that starts with I, ends with E, and uses letters not yet ruled out.  
“IDEAL” – A ruled out.  
“IGLOO” – O ruled out.  
“IMPEL” – seems okay.  
“IVORY” – O ruled out.  
“IVY” – too short.  
“INSET” – N, S, T ruled out.  
“INVEE” – not a word.  
“IVVY” – too short.  

Actually, “IMPEL” is valid.  
But let’s see if we can find a word with distinct letters.  
“IMPEL” uses I, M, P, E, L.  
Another option: “IGLOB” – but B is allowed.  
“IGLOB” is not a common word.  

“IMPEL” seems the best.

But let’s check “IMPEL” against the constraints:
- Starts with I (position 1).  
- Ends with E (position 5).  
- Letters used: I, M, P, E, L.  
All letters except E are allowed (none are in the ruled-out list).  

Therefore, “IMPEL” is a valid next guess.

But let’s think if there’s a better word.  
“IMPEL” is good, but let’s try “IMPEL” or “IMPEL”.

Actually, let’s pick “IMPEL” as it tests M, P, L.

But let’s see another word: “IDYLL” – I, D, Y, L, L.  
D and Y are allowed.  

But “IMPEL” seems more informative.  

Final choice: “IMPEL”.

But let me re-express:

We know:
- Word form: I _ _ _ E
- Allowed letters for positions 2-4: B, D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- We want to test as many new letters as possible.

A good word is “IMPEL” (I M P E L) – but it ends with L, not E.  
Wait, no: “IMPEL” is I M P E L, which ends with L, not E.  
This is wrong.

I need a word that starts with I and ends with E.  
So form: I _ _ _ E.

Possible words:
- I _ _ _ E

Looking at the remaining letters, possible combinations:

I B _ _ E – “IBBLE” – but B is allowed, but “IBBLE” is not a word.  
I D _ _ E – “IDYLL” – I D Y L L – but Y and L are allowed.  
I M _ _ E – “IMBEE” – not a word.  
I P _ _ E – “IPPEE” – not a word.  
I V _ _ E – “IVE” – too short.  
I G _ _ E – “IGGIE” – but G is allowed.  

“IDYLL” is a valid word meaning a pastoral village or a lyrical poem, and it fits I D Y L L, ending with L, but we need to end with E.  
So that’s not it.

Wait, I need I _ _ _ E.

Let me think of actual 5-letter words starting with I and ending with E:

- I _ _ _ E

Possible valid words:
- ILLIE – but L is allowed, but this is obscure.  
- IVY – too short.  
- IGLOO – ends with O.  
- IMPEL – ends with L.  
- INSET – ends with T (ruled out).  
- INVEE – not a word.  
- IRATE – ends with E, but A is ruled out.  
- IRONY – ends with Y.  
- IRATE – A ruled out.  
- IRISE – ends with E, but R is ruled out.  
- IRRIT – ends with T.  
- ISLE – too short.  
- ISLET – ends with T.  
- ITALY – ends with Y.  
- ITCHY – ends with Y.  
- ITALY – ends with Y.  
- IVORY – ends with Y.  
- IVY – too short.  

Actually, there are very few common 5-letter words starting with I and ending with E, given the ruled-out letters.  
The most common seem to be:

- IRATE – A ruled out.  
- IRONY – ends with Y.  
- IRIS – too short.  
- IRATE – A ruled out.  
- IRRIT – ends with T.  
- ISLET – ends with T.  
- ISLE – too short.  
- ITALY – ends with Y.  
- ITCHY – ends with Y.  
- IVORY – ends with Y.  
- IGLOO – ends with O.  
- IMPEL – ends with L.  

It appears that the only viable candidate is “IMPEL” but it ends with L, not E.  
Wait, I must have missed something.  

Let me list all 5-letter English words starting with I and ending with E:

1. ILLIE  
2. IRATE  
3. IRIS (but 4 letters)  
4. IRONY  
5. IRRIT  
6. ISLET  
7. ISLE (but 4 letters)  
8. ITALY  
9. ITCHY  
10. IVORY  
11. IGLOO  
12. IMPEL  

From these, the ones that fit our constraints (no A, R, O, S, U, N, T, F, C, K) are:

- ILLIE – uses I, L, L, I, E – but L is allowed, and I is allowed.  
- IRATE – A ruled out.  
- IRONY – ends with Y.  
- IRRIT – ends with T.  
- ISLET – ends with T.  
- ISLE – too short.  
- ITALY – ends with Y.  
- ITCHY – ends with Y.  
- IVORY – ends with Y.  
- IGLOO – ends with O.  
- IMPEL – ends with L.  

The only valid word left seems to be “ILLIE”, but it repeats letters and is quite obscure.  

However, let me reconsider: the feedback only told us I is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.  
Therefore I could be in position 1, 2, or 3, but we already eliminated positions 2 and 3 for I.  
Thus I must be in position 1.  

Therefore the word must start with I and end with E.  
Given the ruled-out letters, the only remaining candidate is “ILLIE”, but it’s obscure.  

But let me check if there are any other words.  
“IDYLL” – ends with L, not E.  
“IGLOB” – ends with B, not E.  

Actually, the only common word left is “IRATE”, but A is ruled out.  

This suggests that the word must be something like “ILLIE” or “IMBEE” (but not valid).  

Given this, the most plausible word is “ILLIE”, even if it’s obscure.  

But let me double-check the constraints:

- Starts with I (position 1).  
- Ends with E (position 5).  
- Uses only allowed letters: I, L, L, I, E – all allowed.  

Therefore, “ILLIE” is a valid guess.

But let me see if there’s a better word.  
“IMPEL” is invalid because it ends with L.  

Another possibility: “IVVIE” – but V is allowed, but this is not a word.  

Given the constraints, “ILLIE” seems to be the only valid 5-letter word starting with I and ending with E that uses only allowed letters.  

However, let me re-examine the feedback:

From FLICK: F(x) L(-) I(-) C(x) K(x)

- L was in position 2 in FLICK and got “-”, which means L is in the word but not in position 2.  
Therefore L could be in positions 3 or 4.  

Similarly, I was in position 3 in FLICK and got “-”, but we already determined I must be in position 1.  

Thus, the word must be I _ _ _ E, with L somewhere in positions 3 or 4, and other letters from the remaining set.  

A valid word fitting this is “IMBLE” – but this is not a word.  

Another: “IDYLE” – but Y is allowed, and this is a valid word (a simple melody or tune).  

“IDYLE” – I, D, Y, L, E.  
- I in position 1 (required).  
- Ends with E.  
- Letters used: I, D, Y, L, E – all allowed.  

This seems to fit perfectly.

Therefore, the next guess is “IDYLE”.Based on the accumulated information:
- E is fixed in position 5.
- I must be in position 1 (since it cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4).
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (from FLICK feedback).
- Remaining letters to test: D, Y, etc.

The word must be I _ _ _ E with L somewhere in positions 3 or 4. A valid English word fitting this is ""IDYLE"".

Let’s update what we now know from all four guesses.

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)  
   – E is fixed in position 5.  
   – A, R, O, S are absent.

2. UNTIE → U(x) N(x) T(x) I(-) E(✓)  
   – I is in the word but NOT in position 4.  
   – U, N, T are absent.

3. FLICK → F(x) L(-) I(-) C(x) K(x)  
   – L is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
   – F, C, K are absent.  
   – I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (already known).

4. IDYLE → I(-) D(x) Y(x) L(✓) E(✓)  
   – L is in position 4 (✓).  
   – E is in position 5 (✓).  
   – I is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   – D, Y are absent.

Combining all constraints:

- Word form: _ _ _ L E  
- Letters known to be present: I (somewhere in positions 2 or 3, since 1, 4, 5 are excluded).  
- Letters known to be absent: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, F, C, K, D, Y.  
- Remaining candidate letters for positions 1, 2, 3: B, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word ending in “LE” that contains I in position 2 or 3 and uses only allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- ? I _ L E  
- ? _ I L E  

Let’s list valid English words that fit:

- B I _ L E → “BILGE” (B, I, G, L, E) – all letters allowed.  
- H I _ L E → “HILLE” (not a word), “HICLE” (not a word).  
- M I _ L E → “MILLE” (not a word).  
- P I _ L E → “PILES” (ends in S, ruled out).  
- V I _ L E → “VILE” (too short).  
- G I _ L E → “GILLE” (not a word).  

For pattern ? _ I L E:
- B _ I L E → “BIBLE” (B, I, B, L, E) – B twice, valid.  
- M _ I L E → “MILLE” (not a word).  
- P _ I L E → “PILES” (ends in S, ruled out).  
- H _ I L E → “HILLE” (not a word).  

Best candidates:
- BILGE  
- BIBLE  

Both fit all constraints.  
Between them, BILGE uses fresh letters (G) while BIBLE repeats B.  
BILGE is more informative.

So the next guess is BILGE.

So L is allowed.\n\nBut let’s pick a word that tests new letters efficiently.  \n“IMPEL” tests M, P, L.  \nAnother option: “IGLOB” – but B is allowed.  \nActually, “IMPEL” is valid.\n\nHowever, let’s try to test more letters.  \n“IDYLL” – but Y is allowed.  \nBut “IDYLL” has L which is allowed.\n\nBut let’s pick a word that uses distinct new letters.  \n“IMPEL” uses I, M, P, E, L.  \nThat seems good.\n\nBut let’s double-check:  \n- I: allowed in position 1.  \n- M: allowed.  \n- P: allowed.  \n- E: fixed in position 5.  \n- L: allowed (only position 3 was tested in FLICK, but that was “-”, not “x”).  \n\nSo “IMPEL” is valid.\n\nBut let’s see if we can test more letters.  \n“IVVY” is too short.  \n“IVORY” has O (ruled out).  \n“IVY” is too short.  \n\nAnother candidate: “IDYLL” – I, D, Y, L, L.  \nBut double L is okay, and D, Y, L are allowed.  \n\nBut let’s pick “IMPEL” as it tests M, P, L.\n\nBut let’s think differently: we need a word that starts with I, ends with E, and uses letters not yet ruled out.  \n“IDEAL” – A ruled out.  \n“IGLOO” – O ruled out.  \n“IMPEL” – seems okay.  \n“IVORY” – O ruled out.  \n“IVY” – too short.  \n“INSET” – N, S, T ruled out.  \n“INVEE” – not a word.  \n“IVVY” – too short.  \n\nActually, “IMPEL” is valid.  \nBut let’s see if we can find a word with distinct letters.  \n“IMPEL” uses I, M, P, E, L.  \nAnother option: “IGLOB” – but B is allowed.  \n“IGLOB” is not a common word.  \n\n“IMPEL” seems the best.\n\nBut let’s check “IMPEL” against the constraints:\n- Starts with I (position 1).  \n- Ends with E (position 5).  \n- Letters used: I, M, P, E, L.  \nAll letters except E are allowed (none are in the ruled-out list).  \n\nTherefore, “IMPEL” is a valid next guess.\n\nBut let’s think if there’s a better word.  \n“IMPEL” is good, but let’s try “IMPEL” or “IMPEL”.\n\nActually, let’s pick “IMPEL” as it tests M, P, L.\n\nBut let’s see another word: “IDYLL” – I, D, Y, L, L.  \nD and Y are allowed.  \n\nBut “IMPEL” seems more informative.  \n\nFinal choice: “IMPEL”.\n\nBut let me re-express:\n\nWe know:\n- Word form: I _ _ _ E\n- Allowed letters for positions 2-4: B, D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z\n- We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nA good word is “IMPEL” (I M P E L) – but it ends with L, not E.  \nWait, no: “IMPEL” is I M P E L, which ends with L, not E.  \nThis is wrong.\n\nI need a word that starts with I and ends with E.  \nSo form: I _ _ _ E.\n\nPossible words:\n- I _ _ _ E\n\nLooking at the remaining letters, possible combinations:\n\nI B _ _ E – “IBBLE” – but B is allowed, but “IBBLE” is not a word.  \nI D _ _ E – “IDYLL” – I D Y L L – but Y and L are allowed.  \nI M _ _ E – “IMBEE” – not a word.  \nI P _ _ E – “IPPEE” – not a word.  \nI V _ _ E – “IVE” – too short.  \nI G _ _ E – “IGGIE” – but G is allowed.  \n\n“IDYLL” is a valid word meaning a pastoral village or a lyrical poem, and it fits I D Y L L, ending with L, but we need to end with E.  \nSo that’s not it.\n\nWait, I need I _ _ _ E.\n\nLet me think of actual 5-letter words starting with I and ending with E:\n\n- I _ _ _ E\n\nPossible valid words:\n- ILLIE – but L is allowed, but this is obscure.  \n- IVY – too short.  \n- IGLOO – ends with O.  \n- IMPEL – ends with L.  \n- INSET – ends with T (ruled out).  \n- INVEE – not a word.  \n- IRATE – ends with E, but A is ruled out.  \n- IRONY – ends with Y.  \n- IRATE – A ruled out.  \n- IRISE – ends with E, but R is ruled out.  \n- IRRIT – ends with T.  \n- ISLE – too short.  \n- ISLET – ends with T.  \n- ITALY – ends with Y.  \n- ITCHY – ends with Y.  \n- ITALY – ends with Y.  \n- IVORY – ends with Y.  \n- IVY – too short.  \n\nActually, there are very few common 5-letter words starting with I and ending with E, given the ruled-out letters.  \nThe most common seem to be:\n\n- IRATE – A ruled out.  \n- IRONY – ends with Y.  \n- IRIS – too short.  \n- IRATE – A ruled out.  \n- IRRIT – ends with T.  \n- ISLET – ends with T.  \n- ISLE – too short.  \n- ITALY – ends with Y.  \n- ITCHY – ends with Y.  \n- IVORY – ends with Y.  \n- IGLOO – ends with O.  \n- IMPEL – ends with L.  \n\nIt appears that the only viable candidate is “IMPEL” but it ends with L, not E.  \nWait, I must have missed something.  \n\nLet me list all 5-letter English words starting with I and ending with E:\n\n1. ILLIE  \n2. IRATE  \n3. IRIS (but 4 letters)  \n4. IRONY  \n5. IRRIT  \n6. ISLET  \n7. ISLE (but 4 letters)  \n8. ITALY  \n9. ITCHY  \n10. IVORY  \n11. IGLOO  \n12. IMPEL  \n\nFrom these, the ones that fit our constraints (no A, R, O, S, U, N, T, F, C, K) are:\n\n- ILLIE – uses I, L, L, I, E – but L is allowed, and I is allowed.  \n- IRATE – A ruled out.  \n- IRONY – ends with Y.  \n- IRRIT – ends with T.  \n- ISLET – ends with T.  \n- ISLE – too short.  \n- ITALY – ends with Y.  \n- ITCHY – ends with Y.  \n- IVORY – ends with Y.  \n- IGLOO – ends with O.  \n- IMPEL – ends with L.  \n\nThe only valid word left seems to be “ILLIE”, but it repeats letters and is quite obscure.  \n\nHowever, let me reconsider: the feedback only told us I is in the word but not in positions 2 or 3.  \nTherefore I could be in position 1, 2, or 3, but we already eliminated positions 2 and 3 for I.  \nThus I must be in position 1.  \n\nTherefore the word must start with I and end with E.  \nGiven the ruled-out letters, the only remaining candidate is “ILLIE”, but it’s obscure.  \n\nBut let me check if there are any other words.  \n“IDYLL” – ends with L, not E.  \n“IGLOB” – ends with B, not E.  \n\nActually, the only common word left is “IRATE”, but A is ruled out.  \n\nThis suggests that the word must be something like “ILLIE” or “IMBEE” (but not valid).  \n\nGiven this, the most plausible word is “ILLIE”, even if it’s obscure.  \n\nBut let me double-check the constraints:\n\n- Starts with I (position 1).  \n- Ends with E (position 5).  \n- Uses only allowed letters: I, L, L, I, E – all allowed.  \n\nTherefore, “ILLIE” is a valid guess.\n\nBut let me see if there’s a better word.  \n“IMPEL” is invalid because it ends with L.  \n\nAnother possibility: “IVVIE” – but V is allowed, but this is not a word.  \n\nGiven the constraints, “ILLIE” seems to be the only valid 5-letter word starting with I and ending with E that uses only allowed letters.  \n\nHowever, let me re-examine the feedback:\n\nFrom FLICK: F(x) L(-) I(-) C(x) K(x)\n\n- L was in position 2 in FLICK and got “-”, which means L is in the word but not in position 2.  \nTherefore L could be in positions 3 or 4.  \n\nSimilarly, I was in position 3 in FLICK and got “-”, but we already determined I must be in position 1.  \n\nThus, the word must be I _ _ _ E, with L somewhere in positions 3 or 4, and other letters from the remaining set.  \n\nA valid word fitting this is “IMBLE” – but this is not a word.  \n\nAnother: “IDYLE” – but Y is allowed, and this is a valid word (a simple melody or tune).  \n\n“IDYLE” – I, D, Y, L, E.  \n- I in position 1 (required).  \n- Ends with E.  \n- Letters used: I, D, Y, L, E – all allowed.  \n\nThis seems to fit perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is “IDYLE”.Based on the accumulated information:\n- E is fixed in position 5.\n- I must be in position 1 (since it cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4).\n- L is in the word but not in position 2 (from FLICK feedback).\n- Remaining letters to test: D, Y, etc.\n\nThe word must be I _ _ _ E with L somewhere in positions 3 or 4.
