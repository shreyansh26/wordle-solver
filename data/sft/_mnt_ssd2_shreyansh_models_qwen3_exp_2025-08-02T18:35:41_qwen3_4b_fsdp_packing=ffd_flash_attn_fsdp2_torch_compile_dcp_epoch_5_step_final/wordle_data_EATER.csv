### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, T, N, S, R, L, C. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants well. This should give us good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the three guesses.

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   – A, R, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively.
   – O, S are not in the word.

2. early → E(✓) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
   – E is confirmed in position 1.
   – A is confirmed in position 2.
   – R is in the word but not in position 3.
   – L, Y are not in the word.

3. ateer → A(-) T(-) E(-) E(✓) R(✓)
   – A is in the word but not in position 1 (already known from arose).
   – T is in the word but not in position 2.
   – E is confirmed in position 1 (matches earlier).
   – E is in position 4 (but we already know E is only in position 1; this must mean the second E is not valid, so the feedback must be interpreted as: the letter E is confirmed in position 1 and is also in the word but not in position 4).
   – R is confirmed in position 5.

So far we have:
- Fixed positions: E _ _ _ R
- Letters known to be in the word: A (somewhere in 3), T (somewhere in 1,3,4 but 1 is E, 5 is R, so 3 or 4), and E is already placed in 1.
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: O, S, L, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with E
- Ends with R
- Contains A and T somewhere in positions 3 or 4
- Uses only allowed letters (no O, S, L, Y)

Possible patterns: E _ A T R or E _ T A R or E T A _ R or E T _ A R, etc., but we know A must be in 3 or 4 and T must be in 3 or 4.

Looking at valid English words:
- EAT AR – no
- E T A _ R – E T A _ R → E T A _ R, but we need A somewhere. Let’s think systematically.

Possible words:
- EAT AR – invalid
- E T A _ R – E T A _ R → E T A _ R, but we need A somewhere. Let’s list possible words fitting E _ _ _ R with A and T in 3 or 4.

EAT AR – invalid
E T A _ R – E T A _ R → E T A _ R, but we need A somewhere. Let’s think differently.

We need a word like E A T _ R or E A _ T R, but A is already in position 2, so that can’t be. Wait, no, A is confirmed in position 2 from early. So the word is E A _ _ R.

Now we need to place T in position 3 or 4.

Possible words:
- E A T _ R → E A T _ R → E A T _ R, but we need a valid word. E A T E R is ""eater"" but we already tried that (ateer). Next is E A T O R – but O is forbidden. E A T I R – not a word. E A T U R – not a word.

- E A _ T R → E A _ T R → E A _ T R. We need a letter in position 3 that is allowed. Possible letters: not O, S, L, Y. Common letters left: N, I, C, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, U, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for valid words:
- E A N T R – not a word.
- E A I T R – not a word.
- E A D T R – not a word.
- E A G T R – not a word.
- E A H T R – not a word.
- E A M T R – not a word.
- E A P T R – not a word.
- E A B T R – not a word.
- E A F T R – not a word.
- E A K T R – not a word.
- E A U T R – not a word.
- E A V T R – not a word.
- E A W T R – not a word.
- E A X T R – not a word.
- E A Z T R – not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me re-examine the feedback interpretation.

From ateer:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1 (already known).
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 2 (so T could be in 3,4,5; but 5 is R, so 3 or 4).
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 4 (already know E is in 1).
- E(✓) – E is confirmed in position 1.
- R(✓) – R is confirmed in position 5.

So the word is E _ _ _ R, with A and T in positions 3 or 4.

Looking for valid English words:
- E A T _ R – E A T E R (already tried)
- E A _ T R – E A _ T R → E A N T R (invalid), E A I T R (invalid), etc.
- E _ A T R – E _ A T R → E T A T R (invalid), E N A T R (invalid), etc.

Wait, let me think of actual words:
- E A T E R – already tried (ateer)
- E A T O R – invalid (O)
- E A T I R – invalid
- E A T U R – invalid

- E A N T R – invalid
- E A D T R – invalid
- E A G T R – invalid
- E A H T R – invalid
- E A M T R – invalid
- E A P T R – invalid
- E A B T R – invalid
- E A F T R – invalid
- E A K T R – invalid
- E A U T R – invalid
- E A V T R – invalid
- E A W T R – invalid
- E A X T R – invalid
- E A Z T R – invalid

This suggests I might have misinterpreted the feedback. Let me re-examine ateer carefully:

ateer → A(-) T(-) E(-) E(✓) R(✓)
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 2
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 3
- E(✓) – E is confirmed in position 4
- R(✓) – R is confirmed in position 5

Wait, the feedback is for each letter in order:
1. A(-) – A not in position 1
2. T(-) – T not in position 2
3. E(-) – E not in position 3
4. E(✓) – E confirmed in position 4
5. R(✓) – R confirmed in position 5

So the word is _ _ _ E R, with:
- E in position 4
- R in position 5
- Contains A (somewhere in 1,2,3,4 but 4 is E, so 1,2,3)
- Contains T (somewhere in 1,2,3,4,5 but 4 is E, 5 is R, so 1,2,3)
- Does NOT contain O, S, L, Y

So the pattern is _ _ _ E R, with A and T in positions 1,2,3.

Possible words:
- T A _ E R – T A _ E R → T A _ E R. Need a letter in position 3 that is allowed (not O,S,L,Y). Possible letters: N, I, C, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, U, V, W, X, Z.

Valid words:
- T A I N E R – too long
- T A C E R – T A C E R → T A C E R, but this is 5 letters: T A C E R. But we need _ _ _ E R, so T A C E R fits: positions 1-5: T A C E R. But this has R in position 5, E in 4, C in 3, A in 2, T in 1. This seems valid.

Check constraints:
- Contains A (position 2) – ok
- Contains T (position 1) – ok
- No O, S, L, Y – ok
- Pattern _ _ _ E R – T A C E R has E in 4 and R in 5 – matches
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since A is in word but not 1,3,5 – from arose and ateer)
- T is in position 1 (allowed, since T is in word but not 2,3 – from ateer)

This seems correct.

Another possibility:
- P A T E R – but T is in position 3, which is allowed (T not in 2,3 from ateer? No, from ateer T is not in 2, so 1,3,4,5. But 4 is E, 5 is R, so T could be 1 or 3. PAT E R would have T in 3 – allowed.

But P A T E R is a valid word.

Between TACER and PAT ER, both are valid. Let me choose TACER as it tests C.

But wait, TACER is 5 letters: T A C E R.

Yes, this fits all constraints.

Therefore, next guess: TACER.
</think>

Based on the latest feedback, we now know:
- E is in position 4
- R is in position 5
- A and T must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3
- Forbidden letters: O, S, L, Y

A valid word fitting _ _ _ E R with A and T in positions 1-3 is:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, T, N, S, R, L, C. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants well. This should give us good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x): O is not in the word
- S(x): S is not the word
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S
- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): A, R, E

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Does NOT contain O or S
2. Contains A, R, E (but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively)
3. Uses only remaining common letters to maximize information

A good candidate is ""EARLY"":
- Contains E, A, R (all confirmed letters)
- Doesn't use O or S
- Uses L and Y (common letters not yet tested)
- Positions:
  - E in position 1 (allowed since E is only restricted from position 5)
  - A in position 2 (allowed since A is only restricted from position 1)
  - R in position 3 (allowed since R is only restricted from position 2)
- L and Y are new letters to test

This should give us good information about the positions of A, R, E and test L and Y.

- Letters known NOT to be present: O, S, L, Y
- Remaining common letters to test: T, N, I, C, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with EA

- Uses only letters from the allowed set (no O, S, L, Y)
- Uses new letters to maximize information

Possible candidates:

- EAGER – but uses G (new) and second E (allowed)
- EARLY – already tried

EATER fits:

- R in position 5
- T in position 3 is new
- Second E in position 4 is allowed (no restriction on E beyond position 1)

   – E is in position 4 (but we already know E is only in position 1; this must mean the second E is not valid, so the feedback must be interpreted as: the letter E is confirmed in position 1 and is also in the word but not in position 4).
   – R is confirmed in position 5.

So far we have:
- Fixed positions: E _ _ _ R
- Letters known to be in the word: A (somewhere in 3), T (somewhere in 1,3,4 but 1 is E, 5 is R, so 3 or 4), and E is already placed in 1.
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: O, S, L, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with E
- Ends with R
- Contains A and T somewhere in positions 3 or 4
- Uses only allowed letters (no O, S, L, Y)

Possible patterns: E _ A T R or E _ T A R or E T A _ R or E T _ A R, etc., but we know A must be in 3 or 4 and T must be in 3 or 4.

Looking at valid English words:
- EAT AR – no
- E T A _ R – E T A _ R → E T A _ R, but we need A somewhere. Let’s think systematically.

Possible words:
- EAT AR – invalid
- E T A _ R – E T A _ R → E T A _ R, but we need A somewhere. Let’s list possible words fitting E _ _ _ R with A and T in 3 or 4.

EAT AR – invalid
E T A _ R – E T A _ R → E T A _ R, but we need A somewhere. Let’s think differently.

We need a word like E A T _ R or E A _ T R, but A is already in position 2, so that can’t be. Wait, no, A is confirmed in position 2 from early. So the word is E A _ _ R.

Now we need to place T in position 3 or 4.

Possible words:
- E A T _ R → E A T _ R → E A T _ R, but we need a valid word. E A T E R is ""eater"" but we already tried that (ateer). Next is E A T O R – but O is forbidden. E A T I R – not a word. E A T U R – not a word.

- E A _ T R → E A _ T R → E A _ T R. We need a letter in position 3 that is allowed. Possible letters: not O, S, L, Y. Common letters left: N, I, C, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, U, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for valid words:
- E A N T R – not a word.
- E A I T R – not a word.
- E A D T R – not a word.
- E A G T R – not a word.
- E A H T R – not a word.
- E A M T R – not a word.
- E A P T R – not a word.
- E A B T R – not a word.
- E A F T R – not a word.
- E A K T R – not a word.
- E A U T R – not a word.
- E A V T R – not a word.
- E A W T R – not a word.
- E A X T R – not a word.
- E A Z T R – not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me re-examine the feedback interpretation.

From ateer:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1 (already known).
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 2 (so T could be in 3,4,5; but 5 is R, so 3 or 4).
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 4 (already know E is in 1).
- E(✓) – E is confirmed in position 1.
- R(✓) – R is confirmed in position 5.

So the word is E _ _ _ R, with A and T in positions 3 or 4.

Looking for valid English words:
- E A T _ R – E A T E R (already tried)
- E A _ T R – E A _ T R → E A N T R (invalid), E A I T R (invalid), etc.
- E _ A T R – E _ A T R → E T A T R (invalid), E N A T R (invalid), etc.

Wait, let me think of actual words:
- E A T E R – already tried (ateer)
- E A T O R – invalid (O)
- E A T I R – invalid
- E A T U R – invalid

- E A N T R – invalid
- E A D T R – invalid
- E A G T R – invalid
- E A H T R – invalid
- E A M T R – invalid
- E A P T R – invalid
- E A B T R – invalid
- E A F T R – invalid
- E A K T R – invalid
- E A U T R – invalid
- E A V T R – invalid
- E A W T R – invalid
- E A X T R – invalid
- E A Z T R – invalid

This suggests I might have misinterpreted the feedback. Let me re-examine ateer carefully:

ateer → A(-) T(-) E(-) E(✓) R(✓)
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 2
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 3
- E(✓) – E is confirmed in position 4
- R(✓) – R is confirmed in position 5

Wait, the feedback is for each letter in order:
1. A(-) – A not in position 1
2. T(-) – T not in position 2
3. E(-) – E not in position 3
4. E(✓) – E confirmed in position 4
5. R(✓) – R confirmed in position 5

So the word is _ _ _ E R, with:
- E in position 4
- R in position 5
- Contains A (somewhere in 1,2,3,4 but 4 is E, so 1,2,3)
- Contains T (somewhere in 1,2,3,4,5 but 4 is E, 5 is R, so 1,2,3)
- Does NOT contain O, S, L, Y

So the pattern is _ _ _ E R, with A and T in positions 1,2,3.

Possible words:
- T A _ E R – T A _ E R → T A _ E R. Need a letter in position 3 that is allowed (not O,S,L,Y). Possible letters: N, I, C, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, U, V, W, X, Z.

Valid words:
- T A I N E R – too long
- T A C E R – T A C E R → T A C E R, but this is 5 letters: T A C E R. But we need _ _ _ E R, so T A C E R fits: positions 1-5: T A C E R. But this has R in position 5, E in 4, C in 3, A in 2, T in 1. This seems valid.

Check constraints:
- Contains A (position 2) – ok
- Contains T (position 1) – ok
- No O, S, L, Y – ok
- Pattern _ _ _ E R – T A C E R has E in 4 and R in 5 – matches
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since A is in word but not 1,3,5 – from arose and ateer)
- T is in position 1 (allowed, since T is in word but not 2,3 – from ateer)

This seems correct.

Another possibility:
- P A T E R – but T is in position 3, which is allowed (T not in 2,3 from ateer? No, from ateer T is not in 2, so 1,3,4,5. But 4 is E, 5 is R, so T could be 1 or 3. PAT E R would have T in 3 – allowed.

But P A T E R is a valid word.

Between TACER and PAT ER, both are valid. Let me choose TACER as it tests C.

But wait, TACER is 5 letters: T A C E R.

Yes, this fits all constraints.

Therefore, next guess: TACER.Based on the latest feedback, we now know:
- E is in position 4
- R is in position 5
- A and T must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3
- Forbidden letters: O, S, L, Y

A valid word fitting _ _ _ E R with A and T in positions 1-3 is:

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the four guesses.

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   – A, R, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively.
   – O, S are not in the word.

2. early → E(✓) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
   – E is confirmed in position 1.
   – A is confirmed in position 2.
   – R is in the word but not in position 3.
   – L, Y are not in the word.

3. ateer → A(-) T(-) E(-) E(✓) R(✓)
   – A is in the word but not in position 1 (already known from arose).
   – T is in the word but not in position 2.
   – E is confirmed in position 1 (matches earlier).
   – R is confirmed in position 5.

4. tacer → T(-) A(✓) C(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   – T is in the word but not in position 1.
   – A is confirmed in position 2 (matches earlier).
   – C is not in the word.
   – E is confirmed in position 4.
   – R is confirmed in position 5.

So far we have:
- Fixed positions: E _ A _ R (positions 1,2,4,5 are E, A, _, R)
- Letters known to be in the word: T (must be in position 3, since it can’t be 1 or 2 and 4,5 are taken)
- Forbidden letters: O, S, L, Y, C
- Remaining possible letters for position 3: T (already determined), plus any other allowed letters (D, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Z)

But position 3 must be T, because:
- T must be in the word
- T cannot be in positions 1, 2 (from feedback)
- Positions 4 and 5 are already E and R
Therefore, T must be in position 3.

Hence the word must be: E _ A T R

The only common 5-letter English word that fits E _ A T R is:
E G A T R → EGATR (invalid)
E N A T R → ENATR (invalid)
E D A T R → EDATR (invalid)
E P A T R → EPATR (invalid)
E B A T R → EBATR (invalid)
E M A T R → EMATR (invalid)
E I A T R → EIATR (invalid)
E U A T R → EUATR (invalid)
E H A T R → EHATR (invalid)
E K A T R → EKATR (invalid)
E N A T R → ENATR (invalid)

Wait, let me think of valid words:
E A T _ R – but A is in position 2, so E _ A T R

The only valid English word fitting E _ A T R is:
E G A T R – not a word
E N A T R – not a word
E P A T R – not a word
E M A T R – not a word
E B A T R – not a word

Actually, the correct word is:
E N A T R – no, that’s not valid
E M A T R – no
E D A T R – no
E P A T R – no

Wait, let me check the pattern E _ A T R. The only common word is:
E N A T R – no
E P A T R – no
E D A T R – no
E M A T R – no
E B A T R – no
E G A T R – no
E H A T R – no
E I A T R – no
E K A T R – no
E U A T R – no
E V A T R – no
E W A T R – no
E X A T R – no
E Z A T R – no

This suggests I might have made an error. Let me re-examine:

From guess 4 (tacer) we have:
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 1
- A(✓) – A is confirmed in position 2
- C(x) – C is not in the word
- E(✓) – E is confirmed in position 4
- R(✓) – R is confirmed in position 5

So the word must be: _ A _ E R, with T somewhere in positions 2,3 but position 2 is A, so T must be in position 3.

Hence the word is: _ A T E R

Possible letters for position 1 (not O,S,L,Y,C):
D, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Z

Valid English words:
D A T E R – DAT ER (invalid)
G A T E R – G A T E R (valid)
H A T E R – H A T E R (valid)
I A T E R – I A T E R (invalid)
K A T E R – K A T E R (invalid)
M A T E R – M A T E R (invalid)
N A T E R – N A T E R (invalid)
P A T E R – P A T E R (invalid)
U A T E R – U A T E R (invalid)
V A T E R – V A T E R (invalid)
W A T E R – W A T E R (valid)
X A T E R – X A T E R (invalid)
Z A T E R – Z A T E R (invalid)

The valid words are GATER, HATER, WATER.

Among these, GATER and HATER are less common, while WATER is the most common. Let me check WATER:

WATER:
- W (new letter)
- A (position 2, correct)
- T (position 3, must be here)
- E (position 4, correct)
- R (position 5, correct)

This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is WATER.
</think>

Based on the latest feedback, we now know:
- The word pattern is _ A T E R (positions 2,3,4,5 are A,T,E,R)
- The only remaining unknown is the first letter
- Valid first letters (not O,S,L,Y,C): D, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Z
- The most common word fitting this pattern is WATER

<guess>water</guess>",water,"Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the four guesses.

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   – A, R, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively.
   – O, S are not in the word.

2. early → E(✓) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
   – E is confirmed in position 1.
   – A is confirmed in position 2.
   – R is in the word but not in position 3.
   – L, Y are not in the word.

3. ateer → A(-) T(-) E(-) E(✓) R(✓)
   – A is in the word but not in position 1 (already known from arose).
   – T is in the word but not in position 2.
   – E is confirmed in position 1 (matches earlier).
   – R is confirmed in position 5.

4. tacer → T(-) A(✓) C(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   – T is in the word but not in position 1.
   – A is confirmed in position 2 (matches earlier).
   – C is not in the word.
   – E is confirmed in position 4.
   – R is confirmed in position 5.

So far we have:
- Fixed positions: E _ A _ R (positions 1,2,4,5 are E, A, _, R)
- Letters known to be in the word: T (must be in position 3, since it can’t be 1 or 2 and 4,5 are taken)
- Forbidden letters: O, S, L, Y, C
- Remaining possible letters for position 3: T (already determined), plus any other allowed letters (D, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Z)

But position 3 must be T, because:
- T must be in the word
- T cannot be in positions 1, 2 (from feedback)
- Positions 4 and 5 are already E and R
Therefore, T must be in position 3.

Hence the word must be: E _ A T R

The only common 5-letter English word that fits E _ A T R is:
E G A T R → EGATR (invalid)
E N A T R → ENATR (invalid)
E D A T R → EDATR (invalid)
E P A T R → EPATR (invalid)
E B A T R → EBATR (invalid)
E M A T R → EMATR (invalid)
E I A T R → EIATR (invalid)
E U A T R → EUATR (invalid)
E H A T R → EHATR (invalid)
E K A T R → EKATR (invalid)
E N A T R → ENATR (invalid)

Wait, let me think of valid words:
E A T _ R – but A is in position 2, so E _ A T R

The only valid English word fitting E _ A T R is:
E G A T R – not a word
E N A T R – not a word
E P A T R – not a word
E M A T R – not a word
E B A T R – not a word

Actually, the correct word is:
E N A T R – no, that’s not valid
E M A T R – no
E D A T R – no
E P A T R – no

Wait, let me check the pattern E _ A T R. The only common word is:
E N A T R – no
E P A T R – no
E D A T R – no
E M A T R – no
E B A T R – no
E G A T R – no
E H A T R – no
E I A T R – no
E K A T R – no
E U A T R – no
E V A T R – no
E W A T R – no
E X A T R – no
E Z A T R – no

This suggests I might have made an error. Let me re-examine:

From guess 4 (tacer) we have:
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 1
- A(✓) – A is confirmed in position 2
- C(x) – C is not in the word
- E(✓) – E is confirmed in position 4
- R(✓) – R is confirmed in position 5

So the word must be: _ A _ E R, with T somewhere in positions 2,3 but position 2 is A, so T must be in position 3.

Hence the word is: _ A T E R

Possible letters for position 1 (not O,S,L,Y,C):
D, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Z

Valid English words:
D A T E R – DAT ER (invalid)
G A T E R – G A T E R (valid)
H A T E R – H A T E R (valid)
I A T E R – I A T E R (invalid)
K A T E R – K A T E R (invalid)
M A T E R – M A T E R (invalid)
N A T E R – N A T E R (invalid)
P A T E R – P A T E R (invalid)
U A T E R – U A T E R (invalid)
V A T E R – V A T E R (invalid)
W A T E R – W A T E R (valid)
X A T E R – X A T E R (invalid)
Z A T E R – Z A T E R (invalid)

The valid words are GATER, HATER, WATER.

Among these, GATER and HATER are less common, while WATER is the most common. Let me check WATER:

WATER:
- W (new letter)
- A (position 2, correct)
- T (position 3, must be here)
- E (position 4, correct)
- R (position 5, correct)

This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is WATER.Based on the latest feedback, we now know:
- The word pattern is _ A T E R (positions 2,3,4,5 are A,T,E,R)
- The only remaining unknown is the first letter
- Valid first letters (not O,S,L,Y,C): D, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Z

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, T, N, S, R, L, C. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants well. This should give us good information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-): A is in the word but not in position 1
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 2
- O(x): O is not in the word
- S(x): S is not the word
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5

So we know:
- Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S
- Letters that ARE in the word (but positions unknown): A, R, E

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Does NOT contain O or S
2. Contains A, R, E (but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively)
3. Uses only remaining common letters to maximize information

A good candidate is ""EARLY"":
- Contains E, A, R (all confirmed letters)
- Doesn't use O or S
- Uses L and Y (common letters not yet tested)
- Positions:
  - E in position 1 (allowed since E is only restricted from position 5)
  - A in position 2 (allowed since A is only restricted from position 1)
  - R in position 3 (allowed since R is only restricted from position 2)
- L and Y are new letters to test

This should give us good information about the positions of A, R, E and test L and Y.

Guess 2: early -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   – A, R, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively.
   – O, S are not in the word.

2. early → E(✓) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
   – E is now confirmed in position 1.
   – A is confirmed in position 2.
   – R is in the word but not in position 3.
   – L and Y are not in the word.

Current known facts:
- Word pattern: E A _ _ _
- Letters known to be present: E (pos 1), A (pos 2), R (somewhere in 4 or 5)
- Letters known NOT to be present: O, S, L, Y
- Remaining common letters to test: T, N, I, C, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with EA
- Contains R in position 4 or 5
- Uses only letters from the allowed set (no O, S, L, Y)
- Uses new letters to maximize information

Possible candidates:
- EARTH – but H is new, T is new
- EAGER – but uses G (new) and second E (allowed)
- EARLY – already tried
- EATER – uses T (new)

EATER fits:
- E A T E R
- Starts with EA
- R in position 5
- T in position 3 is new
- Second E in position 4 is allowed (no restriction on E beyond position 1)
- No forbidden letters (O, S, L, Y)

This tests T and confirms positions of E, A, R.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the three guesses.

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   – A, R, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively.
   – O, S are not in the word.

2. early → E(✓) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
   – E is confirmed in position 1.
   – A is confirmed in position 2.
   – R is in the word but not in position 3.
   – L, Y are not in the word.

3. ateer → A(-) T(-) E(-) E(✓) R(✓)
   – A is in the word but not in position 1 (already known from arose).
   – T is in the word but not in position 2.
   – E is confirmed in position 1 (matches earlier).
   – E is in position 4 (but we already know E is only in position 1; this must mean the second E is not valid, so the feedback must be interpreted as: the letter E is confirmed in position 1 and is also in the word but not in position 4).
   – R is confirmed in position 5.

So far we have:
- Fixed positions: E _ _ _ R
- Letters known to be in the word: A (somewhere in 3), T (somewhere in 1,3,4 but 1 is E, 5 is R, so 3 or 4), and E is already placed in 1.
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: O, S, L, Y.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with E
- Ends with R
- Contains A and T somewhere in positions 3 or 4
- Uses only allowed letters (no O, S, L, Y)

Possible patterns: E _ A T R or E _ T A R or E T A _ R or E T _ A R, etc., but we know A must be in 3 or 4 and T must be in 3 or 4.

Looking at valid English words:
- EAT AR – no
- E T A _ R – E T A _ R → E T A _ R, but we need A somewhere. Let’s think systematically.

Possible words:
- EAT AR – invalid
- E T A _ R – E T A _ R → E T A _ R, but we need A somewhere. Let’s list possible words fitting E _ _ _ R with A and T in 3 or 4.

EAT AR – invalid
E T A _ R – E T A _ R → E T A _ R, but we need A somewhere. Let’s think differently.

We need a word like E A T _ R or E A _ T R, but A is already in position 2, so that can’t be. Wait, no, A is confirmed in position 2 from early. So the word is E A _ _ R.

Now we need to place T in position 3 or 4.

Possible words:
- E A T _ R → E A T _ R → E A T _ R, but we need a valid word. E A T E R is ""eater"" but we already tried that (ateer). Next is E A T O R – but O is forbidden. E A T I R – not a word. E A T U R – not a word.

- E A _ T R → E A _ T R → E A _ T R. We need a letter in position 3 that is allowed. Possible letters: not O, S, L, Y. Common letters left: N, I, C, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, U, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for valid words:
- E A N T R – not a word.
- E A I T R – not a word.
- E A D T R – not a word.
- E A G T R – not a word.
- E A H T R – not a word.
- E A M T R – not a word.
- E A P T R – not a word.
- E A B T R – not a word.
- E A F T R – not a word.
- E A K T R – not a word.
- E A U T R – not a word.
- E A V T R – not a word.
- E A W T R – not a word.
- E A X T R – not a word.
- E A Z T R – not a word.

Hmm, none of these seem valid. Let me re-examine the feedback interpretation.

From ateer:
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1 (already known).
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 2 (so T could be in 3,4,5; but 5 is R, so 3 or 4).
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 4 (already know E is in 1).
- E(✓) – E is confirmed in position 1.
- R(✓) – R is confirmed in position 5.

So the word is E _ _ _ R, with A and T in positions 3 or 4.

Looking for valid English words:
- E A T _ R – E A T E R (already tried)
- E A _ T R – E A _ T R → E A N T R (invalid), E A I T R (invalid), etc.
- E _ A T R – E _ A T R → E T A T R (invalid), E N A T R (invalid), etc.

Wait, let me think of actual words:
- E A T E R – already tried (ateer)
- E A T O R – invalid (O)
- E A T I R – invalid
- E A T U R – invalid

- E A N T R – invalid
- E A D T R – invalid
- E A G T R – invalid
- E A H T R – invalid
- E A M T R – invalid
- E A P T R – invalid
- E A B T R – invalid
- E A F T R – invalid
- E A K T R – invalid
- E A U T R – invalid
- E A V T R – invalid
- E A W T R – invalid
- E A X T R – invalid
- E A Z T R – invalid

This suggests I might have misinterpreted the feedback. Let me re-examine ateer carefully:

ateer → A(-) T(-) E(-) E(✓) R(✓)
- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 2
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 3
- E(✓) – E is confirmed in position 4
- R(✓) – R is confirmed in position 5

Wait, the feedback is for each letter in order:
1. A(-) – A not in position 1
2. T(-) – T not in position 2
3. E(-) – E not in position 3
4. E(✓) – E confirmed in position 4
5. R(✓) – R confirmed in position 5

So the word is _ _ _ E R, with:
- E in position 4
- R in position 5
- Contains A (somewhere in 1,2,3,4 but 4 is E, so 1,2,3)
- Contains T (somewhere in 1,2,3,4,5 but 4 is E, 5 is R, so 1,2,3)
- Does NOT contain O, S, L, Y

So the pattern is _ _ _ E R, with A and T in positions 1,2,3.

Possible words:
- T A _ E R – T A _ E R → T A _ E R. Need a letter in position 3 that is allowed (not O,S,L,Y). Possible letters: N, I, C, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, U, V, W, X, Z.

Valid words:
- T A I N E R – too long
- T A C E R – T A C E R → T A C E R, but this is 5 letters: T A C E R. But we need _ _ _ E R, so T A C E R fits: positions 1-5: T A C E R. But this has R in position 5, E in 4, C in 3, A in 2, T in 1. This seems valid.

Check constraints:
- Contains A (position 2) – ok
- Contains T (position 1) – ok
- No O, S, L, Y – ok
- Pattern _ _ _ E R – T A C E R has E in 4 and R in 5 – matches
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since A is in word but not 1,3,5 – from arose and ateer)
- T is in position 1 (allowed, since T is in word but not 2,3 – from ateer)

This seems correct.

Another possibility:
- P A T E R – but T is in position 3, which is allowed (T not in 2,3 from ateer? No, from ateer T is not in 2, so 1,3,4,5. But 4 is E, 5 is R, so T could be 1 or 3. PAT E R would have T in 3 – allowed.

But P A T E R is a valid word.

Between TACER and PAT ER, both are valid. Let me choose TACER as it tests C.

But wait, TACER is 5 letters: T A C E R.

Yes, this fits all constraints.

Therefore, next guess: TACER.Based on the latest feedback, we now know:
- E is in position 4
- R is in position 5
- A and T must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3
- Forbidden letters: O, S, L, Y

A valid word fitting _ _ _ E R with A and T in positions 1-3 is:

Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the four guesses.

1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
   – A, R, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively.
   – O, S are not in the word.

2. early → E(✓) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
   – E is confirmed in position 1.
   – A is confirmed in position 2.
   – R is in the word but not in position 3.
   – L, Y are not in the word.

3. ateer → A(-) T(-) E(-) E(✓) R(✓)
   – A is in the word but not in position 1 (already known from arose).
   – T is in the word but not in position 2.
   – E is confirmed in position 1 (matches earlier).
   – R is confirmed in position 5.

4. tacer → T(-) A(✓) C(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   – T is in the word but not in position 1.
   – A is confirmed in position 2 (matches earlier).
   – C is not in the word.
   – E is confirmed in position 4.
   – R is confirmed in position 5.

So far we have:
- Fixed positions: E _ A _ R (positions 1,2,4,5 are E, A, _, R)
- Letters known to be in the word: T (must be in position 3, since it can’t be 1 or 2 and 4,5 are taken)
- Forbidden letters: O, S, L, Y, C
- Remaining possible letters for position 3: T (already determined), plus any other allowed letters (D, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Z)

But position 3 must be T, because:
- T must be in the word
- T cannot be in positions 1, 2 (from feedback)
- Positions 4 and 5 are already E and R
Therefore, T must be in position 3.

Hence the word must be: E _ A T R

The only common 5-letter English word that fits E _ A T R is:
E G A T R → EGATR (invalid)
E N A T R → ENATR (invalid)
E D A T R → EDATR (invalid)
E P A T R → EPATR (invalid)
E B A T R → EBATR (invalid)

E I A T R → EIATR (invalid)
E U A T R → EUATR (invalid)
E H A T R → EHATR (invalid)
E K A T R → EKATR (invalid)
E N A T R → ENATR (invalid)

Wait, let me think of valid words:
E A T _ R – but A is in position 2, so E _ A T R

The only valid English word fitting E _ A T R is:
E G A T R – not a word
E N A T R – not a word
E P A T R – not a word
E M A T R – not a word
E B A T R – not a word

Actually, the correct word is:
E N A T R – no, that’s not valid
E M A T R – no
E D A T R – no
E P A T R – no

Wait, let me check the pattern E _ A T R. The only common word is:
E N A T R – no
E P A T R – no
E D A T R – no
E M A T R – no
E B A T R – no
E G A T R – no
E H A T R – no
E I A T R – no
E K A T R – no
E U A T R – no
E V A T R – no
E W A T R – no
E X A T R – no
E Z A T R – no

This suggests I might have made an error. Let me re-examine:

From guess 4 (tacer) we have:
- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 1
- A(✓) – A is confirmed in position 2
- C(x) – C is not in the word
- E(✓) – E is confirmed in position 4
- R(✓) – R is confirmed in position 5

So the word must be: _ A _ E R, with T somewhere in positions 2,3 but position 2 is A, so T must be in position 3.

Hence the word is: _ A T E R

Possible letters for position 1 (not O,S,L,Y,C):
D, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Z

Valid English words:
D A T E R – DAT ER (invalid)

V A T E R – V A T E R (invalid)
W A T E R – W A T E R (valid)
X A T E R – X A T E R (invalid)
Z A T E R – Z A T E R (invalid)

The valid words are GATER, HATER, WATER.

Among these, GATER and HATER are less common, while WATER is the most common. Let me check WATER:

WATER:
- W (new letter)
- A (position 2, correct)
- T (position 3, must be here)
- E (position 4, correct)
- R (position 5, correct)

This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is WATER.Based on the latest feedback, we now know:
- The word pattern is _ A T E R (positions 2,3,4,5 are A,T,E,R)
- The only remaining unknown is the first letter
- Valid first letters (not O,S,L,Y,C): D, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Z

Let’s think differently.\n\nWe need a word like E A T _ R or E A _ T R, but A is already in position 2, so that can’t be. Wait, no, A is confirmed in position 2 from early. So the word is E A _ _ R.\n\nNow we need to place T in position 3 or 4.\n\nPossible words:\n- E A T _ R → E A T _ R → E A T _ R, but we need a valid word. E A T E R is ""eater"" but we already tried that (ateer). Next is E A T O R – but O is forbidden. E A T I R – not a word. E A T U R – not a word.\n\n- E A _ T R → E A _ T R → E A _ T R. We need a letter in position 3 that is allowed. Possible letters: not O, S, L, Y. Common letters left: N, I, C, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nLooking for valid words:\n- E A N T R – not a word.\n- E A I T R – not a word.\n- E A D T R – not a word.\n- E A G T R – not a word.\n- E A H T R – not a word.\n- E A M T R – not a word.\n- E A P T R – not a word.\n- E A B T R – not a word.\n- E A F T R – not a word.\n- E A K T R – not a word.\n- E A U T R – not a word.\n- E A V T R – not a word.\n- E A W T R – not a word.\n- E A X T R – not a word.\n- E A Z T R – not a word.\n\nHmm, none of these seem valid. Let me re-examine the feedback interpretation.\n\nFrom ateer:\n- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1 (already known).\n- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 2 (so T could be in 3,4,5; but 5 is R, so 3 or 4).\n- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 4 (already know E is in 1).\n- E(✓) – E is confirmed in position 1.\n- R(✓) – R is confirmed in position 5.\n\nSo the word is E _ _ _ R, with A and T in positions 3 or 4.\n\nLooking for valid English words:\n- E A T _ R – E A T E R (already tried)\n- E A _ T R – E A _ T R → E A N T R (invalid), E A I T R (invalid), etc.\n- E _ A T R – E _ A T R → E T A T R (invalid), E N A T R (invalid), etc.\n\nWait, let me think of actual words:\n- E A T E R – already tried (ateer)\n- E A T O R – invalid (O)\n- E A T I R – invalid\n- E A T U R – invalid\n\n- E A N T R – invalid\n- E A D T R – invalid\n- E A G T R – invalid\n- E A H T R – invalid\n- E A M T R – invalid\n- E A P T R – invalid\n- E A B T R – invalid\n- E A F T R – invalid\n- E A K T R – invalid\n- E A U T R – invalid\n- E A V T R – invalid\n- E A W T R – invalid\n- E A X T R – invalid\n- E A Z T R – invalid\n\nThis suggests I might have misinterpreted the feedback. Let me re-examine ateer carefully:\n\nateer → A(-) T(-) E(-) E(✓) R(✓)\n- A(-) – A is in the word but not in position 1\n- T(-) – T is in the word but not in position 2\n- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 3\n- E(✓) – E is confirmed in position 4\n- R(✓) – R is confirmed in position 5\n\nWait, the feedback is for each letter in order:\n1. A(-) – A not in position 1\n2. T(-) – T not in position 2\n3. E(-) – E not in position 3\n4. E(✓) – E confirmed in position 4\n5. R(✓) – R confirmed in position 5\n\nSo the word is _ _ _ E R, with:\n- E in position 4\n- R in position 5\n- Contains A (somewhere in 1,2,3,4 but 4 is E, so 1,2,3)\n- Contains T (somewhere in 1,2,3,4,5 but 4 is E, 5 is R, so 1,2,3)\n- Does NOT contain O, S, L, Y\n\nSo the pattern is _ _ _ E R, with A and T in positions 1,2,3.\n\nPossible words:\n- T A _ E R – T A _ E R → T A _ E R. Need a letter in position 3 that is allowed (not O,S,L,Y). Possible letters: N, I, C, D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, U, V, W, X, Z.\n\nValid words:\n- T A I N E R – too long\n- T A C E R – T A C E R → T A C E R, but this is 5 letters: T A C E R. But we need _ _ _ E R, so T A C E R fits: positions 1-5: T A C E R. But this has R in position 5, E in 4, C in 3, A in 2, T in 1. This seems valid.\n\nCheck constraints:\n- Contains A (position 2) – ok\n- Contains T (position 1) – ok\n- No O, S, L, Y – ok\n- Pattern _ _ _ E R – T A C E R has E in 4 and R in 5 – matches\n- A is in position 2 (allowed, since A is in word but not 1,3,5 – from arose and ateer)\n- T is in position 1 (allowed, since T is in word but not 2,3 – from ateer)\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nAnother possibility:\n- P A T E R – but T is in position 3, which is allowed (T not in 2,3 from ateer? No, from ateer T is not in 2, so 1,3,4,5. But 4 is E, 5 is R, so T could be 1 or 3. PAT E R would have T in 3 – allowed.\n\nBut P A T E R is a valid word.\n\nBetween TACER and PAT ER, both are valid. Let me choose TACER as it tests C.\n\nBut wait, TACER is 5 letters: T A C E R.\n\nYes, this fits all constraints.\n\nTherefore, next guess: TACER.Based on the latest feedback, we now know:\n- E is in position 4\n- R is in position 5\n- A and T must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3\n- Forbidden letters: O, S, L, Y\n\nA valid word fitting _ _ _ E R with A and T in positions 1-3 is:\n\n<guess>tacer</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: early -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)\nGuess 3: ateer -> FEEDBACK: A(-) T(-) E(-) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 4: tacer -> FEEDBACK: T(-) A(✓) C(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Let’s consolidate everything we now know after the four guesses.\n\n1. arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)\n   – A, R, E are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, 5 respectively.\n   – O, S are not in the word.\n\n2. early → E(✓) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)\n   – E is confirmed in position 1.\n   – A is confirmed in position 2.\n   – R is in the word but not in position 3.\n   – L, Y are not in the word.\n\n3. ateer → A(-) T(-) E(-) E(✓) R(✓)\n   – A is in the word but not in position 1 (already known from arose).\n   – T is in the word but not in position 2.\n   – E is confirmed in position 1 (matches earlier).\n   – R is confirmed in position 5.\n\n4. tacer → T(-) A(✓) C(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n   – T is in the word but not in position 1.\n   – A is confirmed in position 2 (matches earlier).\n   – C is not in the word.\n   – E is confirmed in position 4.\n   – R is confirmed in position 5.\n\nSo far we have:\n- Fixed positions: E _ A _ R (positions 1,2,4,5 are E, A, _, R)\n- Letters known to be in the word: T (must be in position 3, since it can’t be 1 or 2 and 4,5 are taken)\n- Forbidden letters: O, S, L, Y, C\n- Remaining possible letters for position 3: T (already determined), plus any other allowed letters (D, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, X, Z)\n\nBut position 3 must be T, because:\n- T must be in the word\n- T cannot be in positions 1, 2 (from feedback)\n- Positions 4 and 5 are already E and R\nTherefore, T must be in position 3.\n\nHence the word must be: E _ A T R\n\nThe only common 5-letter English word that fits E _ A T R is:\nE G A T R → EGATR (invalid)\nE N A T R → ENATR (invalid)\nE D A T R → EDATR (invalid)\nE P A T R → EPATR (invalid)\nE B A T R → EBATR (invalid)\nE M A T R → EMATR (invalid)\nE I A T R → EIATR (invalid)\nE U A T R → EUATR (invalid)\nE H A T R → EHATR (invalid)\nE K A T R → EKATR (invalid)\nE N A T R → ENATR (invalid)\n\nWait, let me think of valid words:\nE A T _ R – but A is in position 2, so E _ A T R\n\nThe only valid English word fitting E _ A T R is:\nE G A T R – not a word\nE N A T R – not a word\nE P A T R – not a word\nE M A T R – not a word\nE B A T R – not a word\n\nActually, the correct word is:\nE N A T R – no, that’s not valid\nE M A T R – no\nE D A T R – no\nE P A T R – no\n\nWait, let me check the pattern E _ A T R.
