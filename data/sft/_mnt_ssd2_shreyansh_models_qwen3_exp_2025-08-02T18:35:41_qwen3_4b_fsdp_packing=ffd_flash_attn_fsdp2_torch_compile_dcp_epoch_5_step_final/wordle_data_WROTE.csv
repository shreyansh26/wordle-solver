Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, S, L).

Looking at letter frequency in English, some of the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A strong opening word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", etc., I think ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

   ⇒ Letters known NOT to appear: A, S

2. BROKE → B(x) R(✓) O(✓) K(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ Confirms pattern _ R O _ E  
   ⇒ Adds B and K as letters NOT in the word.

So far:
- 2nd letter = R  
- 3rd letter = O  
- 5th letter = E  
- Letters excluded so far: A, B, K, S  

We still need valid letters for positions 1 and 4, avoiding the excluded set.

Common remaining consonants/vowels: C, D, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We are looking for a word of the form ? R O ? E.

Possible candidates:
- CROTE (not a valid English word)
- DROVE (D R O V E) – valid word
- FROZE (F R O Z E) – valid word
- GROPE (G R O P E) – valid word
- PROBE (P R O B E) – but B is excluded
- TROPE (T R O P E) – valid word
- WROTE (W R O T E) – valid word

Among these, ""DROVE"" is a very common word and uses D and V, neither of which has been ruled out. It fits the pattern perfectly.

Therefore, DROVE is a strong next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, T, N, S, L).

Looking at letter frequency in English, some of the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A strong opening word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word.

After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", etc., I think ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains:
- A (very common vowel)
- R (common consonant)
- O (common vowel)
- S (common consonant)
- E (the most common letter in English)

This combination should give me good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is in the word and in the 2nd position.
- O(✓) → O is in the word and in the 3rd position.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the 5th position.

So the pattern so far is: _ R O _ E

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has R in the 2nd position.
2. Has O in the 3rd position.
3. Has E in the 5th position.
4. Does not contain A or S.

Possible letters for positions 1 and 4: any letters except A, R, O, S, E (since R, O, E are already placed and A/S are excluded).

Looking at common consonants and vowels left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let's think of words that fit _ R O _ E:
- BROKE
- CRORE (but CRORE is less common)
- DROVE
- FROZE
- GROPE
- PROBE
- TROPE
- WROTE

Among these, ""BROKE"" seems like a good next guess because:
- It fits the pattern _ R O _ E.
- It uses common letters B, K.
- It doesn't reuse A or S.

From all four guesses we now know:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(✓) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ _ R O _ E

2. BROKE → B(x) R(✓) O(✓) K(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ B, K are not in the word.

3. DROVE → D(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ D, V are not in the word.

4. GROPE → G(x) R(✓) O(✓) P(x) E(✓)  
   ⇒ G, P are not in the word.

Forbidden letters so far: A, B, D, G, K, P, S, V  
Allowed letters for positions 1 and 4: C, F, H, I, L, M, N, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We still need a valid English word of the form ? R O ? E.

Remaining candidates:
- CROTE – invalid
- FROZE – uses Z (allowed), but FROZE has Z in position 4
- HROZE – not a word
- IROTE – not a word
- LROTE – not a word
- MROTE – not a word
- NROTE – not a word
- TROTE – not a word
- WROTE – uses T (allowed), W in position 1, T in position 4
- CRORE – uses R twice (possible, but we have no evidence)
- FRORE – not a word
- HRORE – not a word
- IRORE – not a word
- LRORE – not a word
- MRORE – not a word
- NRORE – not a word
- TRORE – not a word
- WRORE – not a word

The only valid word left that fits is FROZE (F R O Z E) and WROTE (W R O T E). Between these, WROTE is more common and uses T, which hasn’t been ruled out.

Therefore, WROTE is the best next guess.
