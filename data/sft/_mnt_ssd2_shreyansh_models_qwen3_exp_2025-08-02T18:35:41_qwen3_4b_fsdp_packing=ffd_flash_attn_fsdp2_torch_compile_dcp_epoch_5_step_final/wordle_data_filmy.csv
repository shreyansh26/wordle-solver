### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", ""AUDIO"", etc. 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E (common letters)
- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E
- RAISE uses R, A, I, S, E
- AUDIO uses A, U, D, I, O

I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it includes R, A, I, S, E - covering several very common consonants and vowels. This should give good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: not in the word (x)
- I: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: not in the word (x)

So we know:
- The word contains the letter I (but not in the 3rd position).
- The letters R, A, S, E are NOT in the word.
- We still have no information about the other 19 letters of the alphabet.

For the next guess, I want to:
1. Keep the letter I (and move it to a different position).
2. Introduce as many new common letters as possible that haven’t been ruled out.
3. Avoid R, A, S, E entirely.

Good letters to try next: T, N, L, C, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

A good candidate is ""TOUND"" (but that’s not a valid English word). Instead, ""POINT"" is valid and uses P, O, N, T, I - none of which have been ruled out except I’s position.

Let’s try ""POINT"":
- P: new letter

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", ""AUDIO"", etc. \n\nLooking at these options:\n- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E (common letters)\n- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E\n- RAISE uses R, A, I, S, E\n- AUDIO uses A, U, D, I, O\n\nI\'ll go with ""RAISE"" because it includes R, A, I, S, E - covering several very common consonants and vowels. This should give good coverage of the alphabet and help narrow down possibilities quickly.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on RAISE:\n- R: not in the word (x)\n- A: not in the word (x)\n- I: in the word but wrong position (-)\n- S: not in the word (x)\n- E: not in the word (x)\n\nSo we know:\n- The word contains the letter I (but not in the 3rd position).\n- The letters R, A, S, E are NOT in the word.\n- We still have no information about the other 19 letters of the alphabet.\n\nFor the next guess, I want to:\n1. Keep the letter I (and move it to a different position).\n2. Introduce as many new common letters as possible that haven’t been ruled out.\n3. Avoid R, A, S, E entirely.\n\nGood letters to try next: T, N, L, C, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.\n\nA good candidate is ""TOUND"" (but that’s not a valid English word). Instead, ""POINT"" is valid and uses P, O, N, T, I - none of which have been ruled out except I’s position.\n\nLet’s try ""POINT"":\n- P: new letter\n- O: new letter\n- I: known to be in the word, now in position 3 (originally position 3 was wrong, so position 3 is now a new test)\n- N: new letter\n- T: new letter\n\n<guess>POINT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(-) N(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two previous guesses we now know:\n\nLetters definitely NOT in the word: R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T  \nLetters that ARE in the word (but we don’t know their exact positions yet): I  \nLetters whose presence/absence is still unknown: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nSince I is the only confirmed letter, we want a word that:\n1.

Current known facts:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T, C, K  
- Letters confirmed in the word: I (in position 2) and Y (in position 5)
- Letters whose status is unknown: B, D, F, G, H, J, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has I in position 2.
2. Has Y in position 5.
3. Uses only letters from the allowed set (no R, A, S, E, P, O, N, T, C, K).
4. Uses new letters to maximize information.

Possible positions: _ I _ _ Y

Remaining common letters we can try: D, L, G, H, B, F, U, M, W

Let’s try “DILLY”:
- D, L, Y (Y already confirmed).
- But L is allowed and hasn’t been tested yet.
- However, “DILLY” repeats L, which might not be optimal.

Better choice: “FILMY”:
- F, I, L, M, Y
- All letters are allowed (F, L, M not yet ruled out).
- I is in position 2, Y in position 5.

Let’s go with FILMY.
