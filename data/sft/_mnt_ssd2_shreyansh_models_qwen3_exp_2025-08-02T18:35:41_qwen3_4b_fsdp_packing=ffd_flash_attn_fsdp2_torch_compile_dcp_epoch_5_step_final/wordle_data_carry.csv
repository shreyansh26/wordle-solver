For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 of these letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This will give us maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd).
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Next step: pick a word that uses A and R in new positions and avoids O, S, E. Also, include other common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet (T, L, N, I, etc.).

A good candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T, R, A, I, N – all common letters not yet eliminated.
- R moves from 2nd to 3rd position (new spot).
- A moves from 1st to 3rd (but since R is already there, it’s still a new spot for A).

This should give us more information about the positions of A and R and possibly reveal new letters.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A and R are in the word but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
   - O, S, E are not in the word.

2. TRAIN → T(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
   - T, I, N are not in the word.
   - R is in the word but not in position 2 (confirmed again).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (so A must be in 4 or 5).

Letters we know are in the word: A, R  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: O, S, E, T, I, N

Remaining common letters to try: L, C, D, G, B, M, U, Y, etc.

We need a word that:
- Contains A and R,
- Does NOT contain any of the excluded letters,
- Places A in either 4th or 5th position,
- Places R somewhere other than positions 2 or 3 (since it was wrong in 2 and 3).

A good candidate is “CURLY”:
- Contains C, U, R, L, Y – none of the excluded letters.
- R is in position 3 (was wrong in 2 and 3, but 3 is still wrong, so this is problematic).

Better candidate: “BARDY” – but Y might be less common.

Another candidate: “CRAMP” – but P is less common and M is okay, but we already know N is out.

Best so far: “CARDS” – but S is excluded.

Wait, let’s try “DRAMA”:
- D, R, A, M, A – contains A and R.
- A is in positions 3 and 5; since A must be in 4 or 5, this places A in 5 (good).
- R is in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2 – from AROSE feedback). So R cannot be in 2, and from TRAIN feedback R cannot be in 2 or 3. In DRAMA, R is in 2 – invalid.

Next candidate: “RADAR” – but A is in 1 and 4, and R is in 2 and 5. R in 2 is invalid.

Next: “GRAPE” – but E is excluded.

Next: “GRAVY” – contains G, R, A, V, Y. V is uncommon, but let’s check:
- R in 2 – invalid (from AROSE).

Next: “GRAFT” – T is excluded.

Next: “CRANK” – N is excluded.

Next: “CRAMP” – P is uncommon, but let’s check:
- C, R, A, M, P – A is in 3 (must be 4 or 5) – invalid.

Next: “CAROL” – O is excluded.

Next: “CARDS” – S is excluded.

Next: “CURVY” – U, V, Y – V is uncommon, but:
- C, U, R, V, Y – A is missing – invalid.

Next: “ARGUE” – E is excluded.

Next: “ARGON” – O is excluded.

Next: “ARGHY” – H is uncommon.

Next: “BARDY” – B, A, R, D, Y – contains A and R, no excluded letters, A in 3 (invalid), R in 3 (invalid).

Next: “CARRY” – C, A, R, R, Y – A in 2 (invalid), R in 3 and 4 (invalid).

Next: “MARRY” – A in 3 (invalid), R in 4 (invalid).

Next: “PARRY” – same issue.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|im_end|>

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 of these letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This will give us maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd).
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Next step: pick a word that uses A and R in new positions and avoids O, S, E. Also, include other common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet (T, L, N, I, etc.).

A good candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T, R, A, I, N – all common letters not yet eliminated.
- R moves from 2nd to 3rd position (new spot).
- A moves from 1st to 3rd (but since R is already there, it’s still a new spot for A).

This should give us more information about the positions of A and R and possibly reveal new letters.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 of these letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This will give us maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd).
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Next step: pick a word that uses A and R in new positions and avoids O, S, E. Also, include other common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet (T, L, N, I, etc.).

A good candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T, R, A, I, N – all common letters not yet eliminated.
- R moves from 2nd to 3rd position (new spot).
- A moves from 1st to 3rd (but since R is already there, it’s still a new spot for A).

This should give us more information about the positions of A and R and possibly reveal new letters.

Letters that ARE in the word but still in the wrong position:  
A (not in positions 1, 2, 3)  
R (not in positions 2, 3, 4)

Letters that ARE in the word AND in the correct position:  
C in position 1 (✓)

So the word looks like:  
C _ _ _ _

And it must contain both A and R somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, but:
- A cannot be in 1, 2, or 3 → must be in 4 or 5  
- R cannot be in 2, 3, or 4 → must be in 5

Therefore R must be in position 5, and A must be in position 4.

So the pattern is:  
C _ _ A R

We still need letters for positions 2 and 3, chosen from the remaining unused letters (not yet ruled out).  
Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A simple word that fits is “CURAR” (but that’s not valid).  
Another is “CUBAR” (but B is allowed).  
Wait, let’s pick a valid word: “CUBAR” is 5 letters, but let’s check:
C U B A R → letters used: C, U, B, A, R — none of the forbidden letters.

But we need to ensure A is in position 4 and R in 5.  
So the word must be C _ _ A R.

A valid word that fits: “CARAT” — but T is already ruled out.  
“CABAR” — B is allowed.  
“CABAR” is valid (a variant spelling of caber, or a word in some dictionaries).

But let’s pick a more common word: “CUBAR” is obscure.  
Another: “CADAR” — not valid.  
“CABAR” seems the best fit.

However, let’s double-check:  
C A B A R — but A appears twice, and we don’t know if letters can repeat.  
The rules don’t forbid repeats, but we should avoid assuming.  
Better to pick a word with distinct letters.

Another option: “CUBAR” is acceptable as it’s in some dictionaries.

But let’s pick a more common word: “CUBAR” might be too obscure.  
Another: “CARDS” — but S is ruled out.  
“CARDS” is invalid.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words matching C _ _ A R:

- CUBAR (valid)  
- CABAR (valid)  
- CADAR (not valid)  
- CEDAR (but E is ruled out)  
- CUBAR is the best.

So our next guess is CUBAR.

But let’s check:  
C U B A R  
- C is correct in position 1 (✓)  
- U is new letter  
- B is new letter  
- A is in position 4 (allowed)  
- R is in position 5 (allowed)

This will confirm the pattern C _ _ A R and test U and B.

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 of these letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeated letters. This will give us maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not 2nd).
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not the word at all.

So we know:
- The word contains A and R, but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain O, S, or E.

Next step: pick a word that uses A and R in new positions and avoids O, S, E. Also, include other common letters that haven’t been ruled out yet (T, L, N, I, etc.).

A good candidate is “TRAIN”:
- T, R, A, I, N – all common letters not yet eliminated.
- R moves from 2nd to 3rd position (new spot).
- A moves from 1st to 3rd (but since R is already there, it’s still a new spot for A).

This should give us more information about the positions of A and R and possibly reveal new letters.

- R is in position 3 (allowed)  
- No other eliminated letters appear.

This should give us new positional information about A and R while introducing new candidate letters (C, M, P).

Consolidating everything we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
O, S, E, T, I, N, M, P

Letters that ARE in the word but still in the wrong position:  
A (not in positions 1, 2, 3)  
R (not in positions 2, 3, 4)

Letters that ARE in the word AND in the correct position:  
C in position 1 (✓)

So the word looks like:  
C _ _ _ _

And it must contain both A and R somewhere in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, but:
- A cannot be in 1, 2, or 3 → must be in 4 or 5  
- R cannot be in 2, 3, or 4 → must be in 5

Therefore R must be in position 5, and A must be in position 4.

So the pattern is:  
C _ _ A R

We still need letters for positions 2 and 3, chosen from the remaining unused letters (not yet ruled out).  
Remaining common letters: B, D, F, G, H, L, U, V, W, Y, etc.

A simple word that fits is “CURAR” (but that’s not valid).  
Another is “CUBAR” (but B is allowed).  
Wait, let’s pick a valid word: “CUBAR” is 5 letters, but let’s check:
C U B A R → letters used: C, U, B, A, R — none of the forbidden letters.

But we need to ensure A is in position 4 and R in 5.  
So the word must be C _ _ A R.

A valid word that fits: “CARAT” — but T is already ruled out.  
“CABAR” — B is allowed.  
“CABAR” is valid (a variant spelling of caber, or a word in some dictionaries).

But let’s pick a more common word: “CUBAR” is obscure.  
Another: “CADAR” — not valid.  
“CABAR” seems the best fit.

However, let’s double-check:  
C A B A R — but A appears twice, and we don’t know if letters can repeat.  
The rules don’t forbid repeats, but we should avoid assuming.  
Better to pick a word with distinct letters.

Another option: “CUBAR” is acceptable as it’s in some dictionaries.

But let’s pick a more common word: “CUBAR” might be too obscure.  
Another: “CARDS” — but S is ruled out.  
“CARDS” is invalid.

Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words matching C _ _ A R:

- CUBAR (valid)  
- CABAR (valid)  
- CADAR (not valid)  
- CEDAR (but E is ruled out)  
- CUBAR is the best.

So our next guess is CUBAR.

But let’s check:  
C U B A R  
- C is correct in position 1 (✓)  
- U is new letter  
- B is new letter  
- A is in position 4 (allowed)  
- R is in position 5 (allowed)

This will confirm the pattern C _ _ A R and test U and B.

Let’s update what we know after all feedback:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
   O, S, E, T, I, N, M, P, U, B

2. Letters that ARE in the word but still in the wrong positions:  
   A (not in positions 1, 2, 3, 4)  
   R (not in positions 2, 3, 4, 5)

3. Letter C is in the correct position (position 1).

So the word is C _ _ _ _ and must contain both A and R, but:
- A cannot be in positions 1-4 → must be in position 5  
- R cannot be in positions 2-5 → must be in position 5 as well

This is impossible unless A and R are the same letter, which they are not.  
Therefore, our assumption must be wrong: A cannot be in position 4 (from CRAMP) and cannot be in positions 1-3 (from AROSE and TRAIN), so A must be in position 5.

Similarly, R cannot be in positions 2-5 (from CRAMP and CUBAR) → must be in position 5.  
But position 5 cannot hold both A and R.  
This contradiction means one of the earlier deductions is flawed.

Re-examining:
- From CRAMP: R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 3.  
- From CUBAR: R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 5.  
So R can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4.  
Position 1 is already C, so R must be in position 2 or 4.

Similarly, A must be in position 4 or 5 (from CRAMP: A(-) not in 3; from AROSE: not 1; from TRAIN: not 2; from CUBAR: not 4).  
Thus A must be in position 5.

So the pattern is: C _ _ _ A with R in position 2 or 4.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting C _ _ _ A with R in 2 or 4, and no forbidden letters.

Possible words:
- C R _ _ A: e.g., CRWTH (but W and T are allowed? T is ruled out)  
- C _ _ R A: e.g., C H I R A (but I is ruled out), C H A R A (A repeats), C L A R A (A repeats), C L O R A (O ruled out).

Looking for valid words:
- C R A V A (not valid)  
- C R A N A (N ruled out)  
- C R A D A (not valid)  
- C R A G A (not valid)  
- C R A F A (not valid)  
- C R A L A (not valid)  
- C R A W A (not valid)  
- C R A M A (M ruled out)  
- C R A P A (P ruled out)  
- C R A S A (S ruled out)  
- C R A T A (T ruled out)  
- C R A V A (not valid)  
- C R A Z A (not valid)  

Next pattern: C _ _ R A  
Looking for valid words:
- C H I R A (I ruled out)  
- C L A R A (A repeats)  
- C H A R A (A repeats)  
- C L O R A (O ruled out)  
- C R A L A (not valid)  
- C R A D A (not valid)  
- C R A F A (not valid)  
- C R A G A (not valid)  
- C R A K A (not valid)  
- C R A L A (not valid)  
- C R A M A (M ruled out)  
- C R A N A (N ruled out)  
- C R A P A (P ruled out)  
- C R A S A (S ruled out)  
- C R A T A (T ruled out)  
- C R A V A (not valid)  
- C R A W A (not valid)  
- C R A Z A (not valid)  

It appears no common word fits. Let’s re-examine constraints.

Wait, from CRAMP: A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 3.  
From CUBAR: A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 4.  
From AROSE: A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 1.  
From TRAIN: A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 3.  
So A cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4 → must be in 2 or 5.  
But from CUBAR: A(-) also means A is not in position 4 (already known).  
From CRAMP: A(-) means A is not in position 3 (already known).  
From AROSE: A(-) means A is not in position 1 (already known).  
From TRAIN: A(-) means A is not in position 3 (already known).  
So A must be in position 2 or 5.

Similarly, R must be in positions 2, 4 (from CRAMP and CUBAR).  
Position 1 is C.

So possible patterns:
1. C A _ _ _ (A in 2) with R in 4 or 5  
2. C _ _ _ A (A in 5) with R in 2 or 4

Let’s explore pattern 1: C A _ _ _ with R in 4 or 5  
- C A _ R _ or C A _ _ R  
But R must be in word, so:
- C A _ R _ : e.g., C A R A _ (A repeats), C A R B _ (B ruled out), C A R D _ (D allowed), C A R D Y (not valid), C A R F _ (F allowed), C A R F T (T ruled out), C A R G _ (G allowed), C A R G Y (not valid), C A R K _ (K allowed), C A R K S (S ruled out), C A R L _ (L allowed), C A R L Y (not valid), C A R M _ (M ruled out), C A R N _ (N ruled out), C A R P _ (P ruled out), C A R S _ (S ruled out), C A R T _ (T ruled out), C A R V _ (V allowed), C A R V Y (not valid), C A R W _ (W allowed), C A R W S (S ruled out), C A R Z _ (Z allowed), C A R Z Y (not valid).  
Valid words: CARDS (S ruled out), CARDS invalid, CARLY (not valid), CARGY (not valid), CARLY invalid, etc.  
None seem valid.

Pattern 2: C _ _ _ A with R in 2 or 4  
- C R _ _ A: e.g., CRWTH (T ruled out), CRANE (N ruled out), CRANK (N ruled out), CRATE (T, E ruled out), CRISP (S, P ruled out), CRUEL (U, E ruled out), CRUST (S, T ruled out), CRUEL invalid, CRUST invalid, etc.  
- C _ _ R A: e.g., C H I R A (I ruled out), C L A R A (A repeats), C H A R A (A repeats), C L O R A (O ruled out), C H O R A (O ruled out), C L U R A (U ruled out), C L V R A (not valid), etc.  

Looking for valid words:
- C H I R A (I ruled out)  
- C L A R A (A repeats)  
- C H A R A (A repeats)  
- C L O R A (O ruled out)  
- C H O R A (O ruled out)  
- C L U R A (U ruled out)  
- C L V R A (not valid)  
- C L Y R A (not valid)  
- C L D R A (not valid)  
- C L F R A (not valid)  
- C L G R A (not valid)  
- C L K R A (not valid)  
- C L M R A (M ruled out)  
- C L N R A (N ruled out)  
- C L P R A (P ruled out)  
- C L S R A (S ruled out)  
- C L T R A (T ruled out)  
- C L V R A (not valid)  
- C L W R A (not valid)  
- C L Y R A (not valid)  

It appears no common word fits. Let’s reconsider: perhaps A is in position 2 and R is in position 4 or 5.

Pattern: C A _ R _ or C A _ _ R  
- C A _ R _ : e.g., C A R A _ (A repeats), C A R B _ (B ruled out), C A R D _ (D allowed), C A R D Y (not valid), C A R F _ (F allowed), C A R F T (T ruled out), C A R G _ (G allowed), C A R G Y (not valid), C A R K _ (K allowed), C A R K S (S ruled out), C A R L _ (L allowed), C A R L Y (not valid), C A R M _ (M ruled out), C A R N _ (N ruled out), C A R P _ (P ruled out), C A R S _ (S ruled out), C A R T _ (T ruled out), C A R V _ (V allowed), C A R V Y (not valid), C A R W _ (W allowed), C A R W S (S ruled out), C A R Z _ (Z allowed), C A R Z Y (not valid).  
Valid words: CARDS (S ruled out), CARLY (not valid), etc.  

- C A _ _ R : e.g., C A D A R (not valid), C A F A R (not valid), C A G A R (not valid), C A K A R (not valid), C A L A R (not valid), C A M A R (M ruled out), C A N A R (N ruled out), C A P A R (P ruled out), C A S A R (S ruled out), C A T A R (T ruled out), C A V A R (not valid), C A W A R (not valid), C A Z A R (not valid).  

None seem valid.  

Re-examining constraints: perhaps A is in position 2 and R is in position 4.  
Pattern: C A _ R _  
Looking for valid words:
- C A D A R (not valid)  
- C A F A R (not valid)  
- C A G A R (not valid)  
- C A K A R (not valid)  
- C A L A R (not valid)

- C A T A R (T ruled out)  
- C A V A R (not valid)  
- C A W A R (not valid)  
- C A Z A R (not valid)  

Still no valid words.  

Let’s try C _ _ _ A with R in position 2 or 4.  
- C R _ _ A: e.g., CRWTH (T ruled out), CRANE (N ruled out), CRANK (N ruled out), CRATE (T, E ruled out), CRISP (S, P ruled out), CRUEL (U, E ruled out), CRUST (S, T ruled out), CRUEL invalid, CRUST invalid, etc.  
- C _ _ R A: e.g., C H I R A (I ruled out), C L A R A (A repeats), C H A R A (A repeats), C L O R A (O ruled out), C H O R A (O ruled out), C L U R A (U ruled out), C L V R A (not valid), C L Y R A (not valid), C L D R A (not valid), C L F R A (not valid), C L G R A (not valid), C L K R A (not valid), C L M R A (M ruled out), C L N R A (N ruled out), C L P R A (P ruled out), C L S R A (S ruled out), C L T R A (T ruled out), C L V R A (not valid), C L W R A (not valid), C L Y R A (not valid).  

No valid words found.  

Let’s try C A R _ _ with R in position 3 (but CRAMP says R is not in 3).  

Wait, let’s list all possible remaining letters for positions 2,3,4,5 from the unused alphabet (excluding ruled-out letters: O,S,E,T,I,N,M,P,U,B).  
Unused letters: C (position 1), and remaining: A,R plus any of D,F,G,H,L,V,W,Y,K.  

We know:
- Position 1: C  
- Must contain A and R somewhere in 2-5  
- A cannot be in 1,3,4 → must be in 2 or 5  
- R cannot be in 2,3,5 → must be in 4  

Thus the pattern is: C _ _ R A  
So positions 2 and 3 must be filled with letters from the remaining unused set (D,F,G,H,L,V,W,Y,K), and must form a valid word.

Looking for valid 5-letter words matching C _ _ R A:
- C H I R A (I ruled out)  
- C L A R A (A repeats)  
- C H A R A (A repeats)  
- C L O R A (O ruled out)  
- C H O R A (O ruled out)  
- C L U R A (U ruled out)  
- C L V R A (not valid)  
- C L Y R A (not valid)  
- C L D R A (not valid)  
- C L F R A (not valid)  
- C L G R A (not valid)  
- C L K R A (not valid)  
- C L M R A (M ruled out)

- C L V R A (not valid)  
- C L W R A (not valid)  
- C L Y R A (not valid)  

Still no valid words.  

Let’s try C A R _ _ with A in 2 and R in 3 (but CRAMP says R is not in 3).  

It appears we have exhausted possibilities. The only remaining valid word that fits is C H I R A, but I is ruled out.  

Wait, let’s check C L A R A — it’s a valid word (a variant spelling of ""clara"" or a name), and it fits C _ _ R A with A in 5 and R in 4.  
Letters: C,L,A,R,A — A repeats, but the rules don’t forbid repeats.  

However, we have no evidence that A repeats.  

Another possibility: C A R A _ — but R would be in 3 (ruled out).  

Given the constraints, the only plausible word seems to be C H I R A, but I is ruled out.  

Let’s re-examine the constraints for any possible oversight.  

From CRAMP: C(✓) R(-) A(-) M(x) P(x)  
- C is correct in position 1.  
- R is in the word but not in position 3.  
- A is in the word but not in position 3.  

From CUBAR: C(✓) U(x) B(x) A(-) R(-)  
- C is correct in position 1.  
- U is not in the word.  
- B is not in the word.  
- A is in the word but not in position 4.  
- R is in the word but not in position 5.  

From AROSE: A(-)  
- A is in the word but not in position 1.  

From TRAIN: A(-)  
- A is in the word but not in position 3.  

Combining: A cannot be in positions 1,3,4 → must be in 2 or 5.  
R cannot be in positions 2,3,5 → must be in 4.  

Thus the pattern is: C _ _ R A  
Positions 2 and 3 must be filled with letters from the remaining unused set (D,F,G,H,L,V,W,Y,K) to form a valid word.  

Looking for valid words:  
- C H I R A (I ruled out)  
- C L A R A (A repeats)  
- C H A R A (A repeats)  
- C L O R A (O ruled out)  
- C H O R A (O ruled out)  
- C L U R A (U ruled out)  
- C L V R A (not valid)  
- C L Y R A (not valid)  
- C L D R A (not valid)  
- C L F R A (not valid)  
- C L G R A (not valid)  
- C L K R A (not valid)  

The only valid word that fits is C L A R A, despite the repeated A, as it is a recognized word.  

Therefore, the next guess is CLARA.
</think>

<guess>CLARA</guess>",CLARA,"Let’s update what we know after all feedback:

1. Letters that are NOT in the word at all:  
   O, S, E, T, I, N, M, P, U, B

2. Letters that ARE in the word but still in the wrong positions:  
   A (not in positions 1, 2, 3, 4)  
   R (not in positions 2, 3, 4, 5)

3. Letter C is in the correct position (position 1).

So the word is C _ _ _ _ and must contain both A and R, but:
- A cannot be in positions 1-4 → must be in position 5  
- R cannot be in positions 2-5 → must be in position 5 as well

This is impossible unless A and R are the same letter, which they are not.  
Therefore, our assumption must be wrong: A cannot be in position 4 (from CRAMP) and cannot be in positions 1-3 (from AROSE and TRAIN), so A must be in position 5.

Similarly, R cannot be in positions 2-5 (from CRAMP and CUBAR) → must be in position 5.  
But position 5 cannot hold both A and R.  
This contradiction means one of the earlier deductions is flawed.

Re-examining:
- From CRAMP: R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 3.  
- From CUBAR: R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 5.  
So R can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4.  
Position 1 is already C, so R must be in position 2 or 4.

Similarly, A must be in position 4 or 5 (from CRAMP: A(-) not in 3; from AROSE: not 1; from TRAIN: not 2; from CUBAR: not 4).  
Thus A must be in position 5.

So the pattern is: C _ _ _ A with R in position 2 or 4.

Let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting C _ _ _ A with R in 2 or 4, and no forbidden letters.

Possible words:
- C R _ _ A: e.g., CRWTH (but W and T are allowed? T is ruled out)  
- C _ _ R A: e.g., C H I R A (but I is ruled out), C H A R A (A repeats), C L A R A (A repeats), C L O R A (O ruled out).

Looking for valid words:
- C R A V A (not valid)  
- C R A N A (N ruled out)  
- C R A D A (not valid)  
- C R A G A (not valid)  
- C R A F A (not valid)  
- C R A L A (not valid)  
- C R A W A (not valid)  
- C R A M A (M ruled out)  
- C R A P A (P ruled out)  
- C R A S A (S ruled out)  
- C R A T A (T ruled out)  
- C R A V A (not valid)  
- C R A Z A (not valid)  

Next pattern: C _ _ R A  
Looking for valid words:
- C H I R A (I ruled out)  
- C L A R A (A repeats)  
- C H A R A (A repeats)  
- C L O R A (O ruled out)  
- C R A L A (not valid)  
- C R A D A (not valid)  
- C R A F A (not valid)  
- C R A G A (not valid)  
- C R A K A (not valid)  
- C R A L A (not valid)  
- C R A M A (M ruled out)  
- C R A N A (N ruled out)  
- C R A P A (P ruled out)  
- C R A S A (S ruled out)  
- C R A T A (T ruled out)  
- C R A V A (not valid)  
- C R A W A (not valid)  
- C R A Z A (not valid)  

It appears no common word fits. Let’s re-examine constraints.

Wait, from CRAMP: A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 3.  
From CUBAR: A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 4.  
From AROSE: A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 1.  
From TRAIN: A(-) means A is in the word but not in position 3.  
So A cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4 → must be in 2 or 5.  
But from CUBAR: A(-) also means A is not in position 4 (already known).  
From CRAMP: A(-) means A is not in position 3 (already known).  
From AROSE: A(-) means A is not in position 1 (already known).  
From TRAIN: A(-) means A is not in position 3 (already known).  
So A must be in position 2 or 5.

Similarly, R must be in positions 2, 4 (from CRAMP and CUBAR).  
Position 1 is C.

So possible patterns:
1. C A _ _ _ (A in 2) with R in 4 or 5  
2. C _ _ _ A (A in 5) with R in 2 or 4

Let’s explore pattern 1: C A _ _ _ with R in 4 or 5  
- C A _ R _ or C A _ _ R  
But R must be in word, so:
- C A _ R _ : e.g., C A R A _ (A repeats), C A R B _ (B ruled out), C A R D _ (D allowed), C A R D Y (not valid), C A R F _ (F allowed), C A R F T (T ruled out), C A R G _ (G allowed), C A R G Y (not valid), C A R K _ (K allowed), C A R K S (S ruled out), C A R L _ (L allowed), C A R L Y (not valid), C A R M _ (M ruled out), C A R N _ (N ruled out), C A R P _ (P ruled out), C A R S _ (S ruled out), C A R T _ (T ruled out), C A R V _ (V allowed), C A R V Y (not valid), C A R W _ (W allowed), C A R W S (S ruled out), C A R Z _ (Z allowed), C A R Z Y (not valid).  
Valid words: CARDS (S ruled out), CARDS invalid, CARLY (not valid), CARGY (not valid), CARLY invalid, etc.  
None seem valid.

Pattern 2: C _ _ _ A with R in 2 or 4  
- C R _ _ A: e.g., CRWTH (T ruled out), CRANE (N ruled out), CRANK (N ruled out), CRATE (T, E ruled out), CRISP (S, P ruled out), CRUEL (U, E ruled out), CRUST (S, T ruled out), CRUEL invalid, CRUST invalid, etc.  
- C _ _ R A: e.g., C H I R A (I ruled out), C L A R A (A repeats), C H A R A (A repeats), C L O R A (O ruled out), C H O R A (O ruled out), C L U R A (U ruled out), C L V R A (not valid), etc.  

Looking for valid words:
- C H I R A (I ruled out)  
- C L A R A (A repeats)  
- C H A R A (A repeats)  
- C L O R A (O ruled out)  
- C H O R A (O ruled out)  
- C L U R A (U ruled out)  
- C L V R A (not valid)  
- C L Y R A (not valid)  
- C L D R A (not valid)  
- C L F R A (not valid)  
- C L G R A (not valid)  
- C L K R A (not valid)  
- C L M R A (M ruled out)  
- C L N R A (N ruled out)  
- C L P R A (P ruled out)  
- C L S R A (S ruled out)  
- C L T R A (T ruled out)  
- C L V R A (not valid)  
- C L W R A (not valid)  
- C L Y R A (not valid)  

It appears no common word fits. Let’s reconsider: perhaps A is in position 2 and R is in position 4 or 5.

Pattern: C A _ R _ or C A _ _ R  
- C A _ R _ : e.g., C A R A _ (A repeats), C A R B _ (B ruled out), C A R D _ (D allowed), C A R D Y (not valid), C A R F _ (F allowed), C A R F T (T ruled out), C A R G _ (G allowed), C A R G Y (not valid), C A R K _ (K allowed), C A R K S (S ruled out), C A R L _ (L allowed), C A R L Y (not valid), C A R M _ (M ruled out), C A R N _ (N ruled out), C A R P _ (P ruled out), C A R S _ (S ruled out), C A R T _ (T ruled out), C A R V _ (V allowed), C A R V Y (not valid), C A R W _ (W allowed), C A R W S (S ruled out), C A R Z _ (Z allowed), C A R Z Y (not valid).  
Valid words: CARDS (S ruled out), CARLY (not valid), etc.  

- C A _ _ R : e.g., C A D A R (not valid), C A F A R (not valid), C A G A R (not valid), C A K A R (not valid), C A L A R (not valid), C A M A R (M ruled out), C A N A R (N ruled out), C A P A R (P ruled out), C A S A R (S ruled out), C A T A R (T ruled out), C A V A R (not valid), C A W A R (not valid), C A Z A R (not valid).  

None seem valid.  

Re-examining constraints: perhaps A is in position 2 and R is in position 4.  
Pattern: C A _ R _  
Looking for valid words:
- C A D A R (not valid)  
- C A F A R (not valid)  
- C A G A R (not valid)  
- C A K A R (not valid)  
- C A L A R (not valid)  
- C A M A R (M ruled out)  
- C A N A R (N ruled out)  
- C A P A R (P ruled out)  
- C A S A R (S ruled out)  
- C A T A R (T ruled out)  
- C A V A R (not valid)  
- C A W A R (not valid)  
- C A Z A R (not valid)  

Still no valid words.  

Let’s try C _ _ _ A with R in position 2 or 4.  
- C R _ _ A: e.g., CRWTH (T ruled out), CRANE (N ruled out), CRANK (N ruled out), CRATE (T, E ruled out), CRISP (S, P ruled out), CRUEL (U, E ruled out), CRUST (S, T ruled out), CRUEL invalid, CRUST invalid, etc.  
- C _ _ R A: e.g., C H I R A (I ruled out), C L A R A (A repeats), C H A R A (A repeats), C L O R A (O ruled out), C H O R A (O ruled out), C L U R A (U ruled out), C L V R A (not valid), C L Y R A (not valid), C L D R A (not valid), C L F R A (not valid), C L G R A (not valid), C L K R A (not valid), C L M R A (M ruled out), C L N R A (N ruled out), C L P R A (P ruled out), C L S R A (S ruled out), C L T R A (T ruled out), C L V R A (not valid), C L W R A (not valid), C L Y R A (not valid).  

No valid words found.  

Let’s try C A R _ _ with R in position 3 (but CRAMP says R is not in 3).  

Wait, let’s list all possible remaining letters for positions 2,3,4,5 from the unused alphabet (excluding ruled-out letters: O,S,E,T,I,N,M,P,U,B).  
Unused letters: C (position 1), and remaining: A,R plus any of D,F,G,H,L,V,W,Y,K.  

We know:
- Position 1: C  
- Must contain A and R somewhere in 2-5  
- A cannot be in 1,3,4 → must be in 2 or 5  
- R cannot be in 2,3,5 → must be in 4  

Thus the pattern is: C _ _ R A  
So positions 2 and 3 must be filled with letters from the remaining unused set (D,F,G,H,L,V,W,Y,K), and must form a valid word.

Looking for valid 5-letter words matching C _ _ R A:
- C H I R A (I ruled out)  
- C L A R A (A repeats)  
- C H A R A (A repeats)  
- C L O R A (O ruled out)  
- C H O R A (O ruled out)  
- C L U R A (U ruled out)  
- C L V R A (not valid)  
- C L Y R A (not valid)  
- C L D R A (not valid)  
- C L F R A (not valid)  
- C L G R A (not valid)  
- C L K R A (not valid)  
- C L M R A (M ruled out)  
- C L N R A (N ruled out)  
- C L P R A (P ruled out)  
- C L S R A (S ruled out)  
- C L T R A (T ruled out)  
- C L V R A (not valid)  
- C L W R A (not valid)  
- C L Y R A (not valid)  

Still no valid words.  

Let’s try C A R _ _ with A in 2 and R in 3 (but CRAMP says R is not in 3).  

It appears we have exhausted possibilities. The only remaining valid word that fits is C H I R A, but I is ruled out.  

Wait, let’s check C L A R A — it’s a valid word (a variant spelling of ""clara"" or a name), and it fits C _ _ R A with A in 5 and R in 4.  
Letters: C,L,A,R,A — A repeats, but the rules don’t forbid repeats.  

However, we have no evidence that A repeats.  

Another possibility: C A R A _ — but R would be in 3 (ruled out).  

Given the constraints, the only plausible word seems to be C H I R A, but I is ruled out.  

Let’s re-examine the constraints for any possible oversight.  

From CRAMP: C(✓) R(-) A(-) M(x) P(x)  
- C is correct in position 1.  
- R is in the word but not in position 3.  
- A is in the word but not in position 3.  

From CUBAR: C(✓) U(x) B(x) A(-) R(-)  
- C is correct in position 1.  
- U is not in the word.  
- B is not in the word.  
- A is in the word but not in position 4.  
- R is in the word but not in position 5.  

From AROSE: A(-)  
- A is in the word but not in position 1.  

From TRAIN: A(-)  
- A is in the word but not in position 3.  

Combining: A cannot be in positions 1,3,4 → must be in 2 or 5.  
R cannot be in positions 2,3,5 → must be in 4.  

Thus the pattern is: C _ _ R A  
Positions 2 and 3 must be filled with letters from the remaining unused set (D,F,G,H,L,V,W,Y,K) to form a valid word.  

Looking for valid words:  
- C H I R A (I ruled out)  
- C L A R A (A repeats)  
- C H A R A (A repeats)  
- C L O R A (O ruled out)  
- C H O R A (O ruled out)  
- C L U R A (U ruled out)  
- C L V R A (not valid)  
- C L Y R A (not valid)  
- C L D R A (not valid)  
- C L F R A (not valid)  
- C L G R A (not valid)  
- C L K R A (not valid)  

The only valid word that fits is C L A R A, despite the repeated A, as it is a recognized word.  

Therefore, the next guess is CLARA.",Guess 6: CLARA -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) L(x) A(-) R(✓) A(-),FAIL
