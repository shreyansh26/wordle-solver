For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should have:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
- No repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible

After considering these factors, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 common vowels (A, E) and 2 very common consonants (S, L, T)
- It tests 5 unique letters
- These letters appear frequently in English words
- It covers both short and long vowels (A, E) as well as common consonants (S, L, T)

This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but NOT in position 3.
2. The letters S, L, T, E are absent.
3. We need to test other common vowels (I, O, U) and consonants (R, N, C, etc.).

A good next guess should:
- Keep the letter A (since we know it’s in the word).
- Introduce new common letters that weren’t tested yet.
- Avoid the letters S, L, T, E.
- Avoid repeating any letters to maximize information.

Considering common 5-letter words, “CRAIN” is a good choice because:
- It keeps A (in a new position).
- It introduces C, R, I, N which are common letters not yet tested.
- None of the letters are S, L, T, or E.
- All letters are unique.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters.

Letters known to be absent: S, L, T, E, C, I, N, G, V.

Remaining common letters to test: B, D, F, H, K, M, P, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, R, Y (all confirmed present).  
- Does not use any of the banned letters.  
- Places A, R, Y in new positions to narrow down possibilities.

A good candidate is “DRYAR” – but it repeats A and R, and we don’t know if duplicates are allowed (Wordle typically doesn’t have duplicates).  
Another is “BRAWY” – but W is untested, A is in position 2 (allowed), R is in position 3 (allowed), Y is in position 5 (but feedback says Y is not in position 5).  
So “BRAWY” is invalid because Y would be in position 5 and we know Y is not there.

Next candidate: “FARRY” – repeats R, and Y is in position 5 (invalid).  
Next: “DARRY” – repeats R, Y in 5 (invalid).  
Next: “BARRY” – repeats R, Y in 5 (invalid).

We need a word with A, R, Y in different positions and no banned letters.  
Let’s try “BRAWY” again but swap Y to position 4: “BRAWY” → “BRAWY” has Y in 5, so invalid.  
Swap to “BRAWY” → “BRAWY” is same.  
We need Y in 1,2,3, or 4.

Try “YARDB” – but D and B are untested, and we have A, R, Y.  
Check letters: Y, A, R, D, B – none banned.  
Positions:  
Y in 1 (new), A in 2 (new), R in 3 (new), D in 4 (new), B in 5 (new).  
This tests A, R, Y in positions 2,3,1 respectively, and introduces D and B.

This seems optimal.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should have:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
- No repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible

After considering these factors, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 common vowels (A, E) and 2 very common consonants (S, L, T)
- It tests 5 unique letters
- These letters appear frequently in English words
- It covers both short and long vowels (A, E) as well as common consonants (S, L, T)

This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but NOT in position 3.
2. The letters S, L, T, E are absent.
3. We need to test other common vowels (I, O, U) and consonants (R, N, C, etc.).

A good next guess should:
- Keep the letter A (since we know it’s in the word).
- Introduce new common letters that weren’t tested yet.
- Avoid the letters S, L, T, E.
- Avoid repeating any letters to maximize information.

Considering common 5-letter words, “CRAIN” is a good choice because:
- It keeps A (in a new position).
- It introduces C, R, I, N which are common letters not yet tested.
- None of the letters are S, L, T, or E.
- All letters are unique.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. CRAIN → C(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)  
   – R is in the word but not in position 2.  
   – A is again marked “-”, so it is not in position 3 (confirmed).  
   – C, I, N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A, R (and we still need to find their exact positions).
- Letters not in the word: S, L, T, E, C, I, N.

We need a word that:
- Contains A and R.
- Does not use S, L, T, E, C, I, N.
- Uses fresh, common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: O, U (A is already confirmed).

A strong candidate is “ROARD” – but it repeats R and D is untested.  
A better choice is “GROAN” – but N is already ruled out.  
Next: “BRAID” – but I and D are untested; I is ruled out.  
Next: “GROAN” – N ruled out.  
Next: “GRAFT” – T ruled out.  
Next: “GRAVY” – Y is untested, V is untested, A and R are both in.  
This seems valid.

Let’s check:  
G, R, A, V, Y – none of the forbidden letters (S, L, T, E, C, I, N).  
This tests G, A, V, Y, R.

Another candidate: “DRAFT” – T ruled out.  
“GRAVY” seems optimal.

- ""P A R A Y"" – not a word.
- ""P A R K Y"" – K is untested, Y in 5 (allowed), but K is untested and we need R in 3.

Valid words:
- ""R A Y _ _"" – ""RAYON"" (O is untested, N is out) – N is out.

""M A R Y _"" – ""MARRY"" is the only word, but repeats.

Let me try ""P A R K Y"" – but K is untested, Y in 5 (allowed), R in 3 (allowed), and P is untested.

But ""PARKY"" is a valid word (British slang for ""proud"" or ""puffed up"").

Check letters: P, A, R, K, Y – none are banned. A is in position 2 (correct), R is in 3 (allowed), Y is in 5 (allowed). This tests K and P.

This seems like a good next guess.

Alternative: ""F A R Y S"" – S is out.
""F A R Y _"" – no valid 5-letter word.

Another: ""B A R Y _"" – B is out.
""C A R Y _"" – C is out.
""D A R Y _"" – D is out.
""G A R Y _"" – G is out.
""H A R Y _"" – ""HARRY"" – repeats R and Y.

Let me confirm:
- P, A, R, K, Y – all allowed.
- A is in position 2 (correct).
- R is in position 3 (allowed).

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize the information gained. A good starting word should have:
- Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
- Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
- No repeating letters to test as many unique letters as possible

After considering these factors, ""SLATE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 common vowels (A, E) and 2 very common consonants (S, L, T)
- It tests 5 unique letters
- These letters appear frequently in English words
- It covers both short and long vowels (A, E) as well as common consonants (S, L, T)

This should give us good information about which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are all NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word contains the letter A, but NOT in position 3.
2. The letters S, L, T, E are absent.
3. We need to test other common vowels (I, O, U) and consonants (R, N, C, etc.).

A good next guess should:
- Keep the letter A (since we know it’s in the word).
- Introduce new common letters that weren’t tested yet.
- Avoid the letters S, L, T, E.
- Avoid repeating any letters to maximize information.

Considering common 5-letter words, “CRAIN” is a good choice because:
- It keeps A (in a new position).
- It introduces C, R, I, N which are common letters not yet tested.
- None of the letters are S, L, T, or E.
- All letters are unique.

This should give us more information about the remaining letters.

Guess 2: CRAIN -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. CRAIN → C(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)  
   – R is in the word but not in position 2.  
   – A is again marked “-”, so it is not in position 3 (confirmed).  
   – C, I, N are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A, R (and we still need to find their exact positions).
- Letters not in the word: S, L, T, E, C, I, N.

We need a word that:
- Contains A and R.
- Does not use S, L, T, E, C, I, N.
- Uses fresh, common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: O, U (A is already confirmed).

A strong candidate is “ROARD” – but it repeats R and D is untested.  
A better choice is “GROAN” – but N is already ruled out.  
Next: “BRAID” – but I and D are untested; I is ruled out.  
Next: “GROAN” – N ruled out.  
Next: “GRAFT” – T ruled out.  
Next: “GRAVY” – Y is untested, V is untested, A and R are both in.  
This seems valid.

Let’s check:  
G, R, A, V, Y – none of the forbidden letters (S, L, T, E, C, I, N).  
This tests G, A, V, Y, R.

Another candidate: “DRAFT” – T ruled out.  
“GRAVY” seems optimal.

From the three rounds we now know:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)  
   – A is in the word but not in position 3.

2. CRAIN → C(x) R(-) A(-) I(x) N(x)  
   – R is in the word but not in position 2.  
   – A is again “-”, so it is not in position 3 (confirmed).  
   – C, I, N are out.

3. GRAVY → G(x) R(-) A(-) V(x) Y(-)  
   – R is still “-”, so it is not in position 2 (confirmed).  
   – A is again “-”, so it is not in position 3 (confirmed).  
   – G, V are out.  
   – Y is in the word but not in position 5.

Letters known to be in the word: A, R, Y.  
Letters known to be absent: S, L, T, E, C, I, N, G, V.

Remaining common letters to test: B, D, F, H, K, M, P, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses A, R, Y (all confirmed present).  
- Does not use any of the banned letters.  
- Places A, R, Y in new positions to narrow down possibilities.

A good candidate is “DRYAR” – but it repeats A and R, and we don’t know if duplicates are allowed (Wordle typically doesn’t have duplicates).  
Another is “BRAWY” – but W is untested, A is in position 2 (allowed), R is in position 3 (allowed), Y is in position 5 (but feedback says Y is not in position 5).  
So “BRAWY” is invalid because Y would be in position 5 and we know Y is not there.

Next candidate: “FARRY” – repeats R, and Y is in position 5 (invalid).  
Next: “DARRY” – repeats R, Y in 5 (invalid).  
Next: “BARRY” – repeats R, Y in 5 (invalid).

We need a word with A, R, Y in different positions and no banned letters.  
Let’s try “BRAWY” again but swap Y to position 4: “BRAWY” → “BRAWY” has Y in 5, so invalid.  
Swap to “BRAWY” → “BRAWY” is same.  
We need Y in 1,2,3, or 4.

Try “YARDB” – but D and B are untested, and we have A, R, Y.  
Check letters: Y, A, R, D, B – none banned.  
Positions:  
Y in 1 (new), A in 2 (new), R in 3 (new), D in 4 (new), B in 5 (new).  
This tests A, R, Y in positions 2,3,1 respectively, and introduces D and B.

This seems optimal.

From all five guesses we now know:

1. A is fixed in position 2: _ A _ _ _
2. R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 5 (from CRAIN, YARDB, PARKY)
   ⇒ R must be in position 1 or 4.
3. Y is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 5 (from GRAVY, YARDB, PARKY)
   ⇒ Y must be in position 3 or 4.
4. Banned letters so far: S, L, T, E, C, I, N, G, V, D, P, K.
5. Still-allowed common letters: F, H, M, U, O, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A in position 2
- R in position 1 or 4
- Y in position 3 or 4
- No banned letters

Possible patterns:
- R A Y _ _   (R in 1, Y in 3)
- _ A R Y _   (R in 3 is banned, so invalid)
- _ A _ R Y   (R in 4, Y in 5 is banned, so invalid)
- _ A Y R _   (R in 4, Y in 3)
- R A _ Y _   (R in 1, Y in 4)
- _ A _ Y R   (R in 5 is banned, so invalid)

Valid patterns:
- R A Y _ _   (need two more letters, no banned ones)
- R A _ Y _
- _ A Y R _
- _ A _ R Y   (Y in 5 is banned, invalid)

Let’s list actual words that fit:

1. R A Y _ _  
   - RAYON – O is allowed, N is banned  
   - RAYES – E is banned  
   - RAYED – E is banned  
   - RAYED – no valid 5-letter word.

2. R A _ Y _  
   - R A M Y _ – “RAMMY” (double M) or “RAMMY” – not a word.  
   - R A F Y _ – “RAFY_” – no 5-letter word.  
   - R A W Y _ – “RAWY_” – no 5-letter word.  
   - R A H Y _ – “RAHY_” – no 5-letter word.  
   - R A M Y _ – “RAMMY” – not valid.

3. _ A Y R _  
   - F A Y R _ – “FAIRY” – I is banned.  
   - M A Y R _ – “MAYOR” – O is allowed, R is in 4, Y in 3.  
     Check letters: M, A, Y, O, R – none banned.  
     Pattern: _ A Y R _ → M A Y R _ → “MAYOR” fits perfectly.

4. _ A _ R Y – Y in 5 is banned, invalid.

Thus, the only valid candidate that fits all constraints is “MAYOR”.

Check:
- M, A, Y, O, R – none banned.  
- A is in position 2 (✓).  
- R is in position 4 (allowed).  
- Y is in position 3 (allowed).  
- Tests new letter O.

This should give us the final confirmation.
