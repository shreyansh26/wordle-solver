### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often contain vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it has:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and positions.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are completely absent from the secret word.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S L A T E are all absent.
2. CRONY → C Y are absent; R and O are present but in the wrong positions.

So the secret word:
- Does not contain S, L, A, T, E, C, Y.
- Contains R and O somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (i.e., not S, L, A, T, E, C, Y).
- Must include R and O in positions different from 2 and 3.

Remaining common letters to try: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

A good next guess should test several new consonants and possibly the remaining vowels (I, U).  
Let’s pick a word that:
- Uses R and O in new positions.
- Introduces several fresh consonants.

A strong candidate is “FORUM”:
- F, U, M are new letters.
- O moves to position 1 (was position 3).
- R moves to position 4 (was position 2).

This tests three new consonants (F, R, M) and two new vowels (O, U) while repositioning R and O.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often contain vowels and common consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". I'll go with ""SLATE"" because it has:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give me good coverage of common letters and positions.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That means the secret word contains none of these letters.  
To maximize information in the second guess, I should pick a word that uses entirely different letters.  
A good strategy is to use other common consonants and vowels.  
Looking at the remaining common letters: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, M, P, Y, etc.  
A strong candidate is “CRONY” because it uses:
- C, R, N, O, Y — none of which appeared in SLATE.
- It covers several new consonants and the vowel O.
- It has a good mix of frequent letters that will help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S L A T E are all absent.
2. CRONY → C Y are absent; R and O are present but in the wrong positions.

So the secret word:
- Does not contain S, L, A, T, E, C, Y.
- Contains R and O somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (i.e., not S, L, A, T, E, C, Y).
- Must include R and O in positions different from 2 and 3.

Remaining common letters to try: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

A good next guess should test several new consonants and possibly the remaining vowels (I, U).  
Let’s pick a word that:
- Uses R and O in new positions.
- Introduces several fresh consonants.

A strong candidate is “FORUM”:
- F, U, M are new letters.
- O moves to position 1 (was position 3).
- R moves to position 4 (was position 2).

This tests three new consonants (F, R, M) and two new vowels (O, U) while repositioning R and O.

From the four guesses we have:

Letters ruled out: S, L, A, T, E, C, Y, F, U, M, B, K  
Letters that must appear: R, O (with O now known to be in position 4).

Positions ruled out so far:
- R cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 5 (from CRONY, FORUM, BROOK).  
  Remaining possible positions for R: 1 or 3.
- O cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from CRONY, FORUM, BROOK).  
  But O is confirmed in position 4, so the remaining O must go elsewhere, but positions 2, 3, 5 are ruled out.  
  This implies the word has exactly one O in position 4.

So the word structure is: _ _ _ O _

Letters left to use: R (must be in 1 or 3), plus any of the still-allowed consonants: D, G, H, I, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- O in position 4.
- R in position 1 or 3.
- All other letters from the allowed set.

Possible patterns:
1. R _ _ O _
2. _ _ R O _

Let’s try pattern 1: R _ _ O _
We need two more letters (positions 2 and 3) from the allowed set, forming a valid word.

A common word fitting this pattern is “RIDGE” but E is ruled out.  
Next: “RIGID” – I and D are allowed.  
Check: R I G I D – but we already used I in “FORUM” (U was ruled out, but I wasn’t tested yet).  
Wait, “RIGID” has I in positions 2 and 4, but position 4 must be O.  
So that won’t work.

Let’s try “RIPER” – but E is out.  
“RIPON” – N is allowed.  
“RIPON” has R in 1, I in 2, P in 3, O in 4, N in 5.  
This uses only allowed letters and positions.

Let’s verify:
- R in position 1 (allowed).
- O in position 4 (correct).
- I, P, N are all new and allowed.

Thus, “RIPON” is a valid next guess.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That means the secret word contains none of these letters.  
To maximize information in the second guess, I should pick a word that uses entirely different letters.  
A good strategy is to use other common consonants and vowels.  
Looking at the remaining common letters: R, I, N, O, U, C, H, M, P, Y, etc.  
A strong candidate is “CRONY” because it uses:
- C, R, N, O, Y — none of which appeared in SLATE.
- It covers several new consonants and the vowel O.
- It has a good mix of frequent letters that will help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the two guesses we have:

2. CRONY → C Y are absent; R and O are present but in the wrong positions.

So the secret word:
- Does not contain S, L, A, T, E, C, Y.
- Contains R and O somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out (i.e., not S, L, A, T, E, C, Y).
- Must include R and O in positions different from 2 and 3.

Remaining common letters to try: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

A good next guess should test several new consonants and possibly the remaining vowels (I, U).  
Let’s pick a word that:
- Uses R and O in new positions.
- Introduces several fresh consonants.

A strong candidate is “FORUM”:
- F, U, M are new letters.
- O moves to position 1 (was position 3).
- R moves to position 4 (was position 2).

This tests three new consonants (F, R, M) and two new vowels (O, U) while repositioning R and O.

From the five guesses we now know:

Letters ruled out:  
S, L, A, T, E, C, Y, F, U, M, B, K, P, N

Letters confirmed present:  
I (in position 2) and O (in position 4)

Letters confirmed absent from position 2: R (from CRONY: R(-) in position 2)  
Letters confirmed absent from position 5: N (from RIPON: N(x))  
Letters confirmed absent from position 1: R (from RIPON: R(-) in position 1)

So the word structure is:  
_ I _ O _

We still need letters for positions 1, 3, and 5, chosen only from the remaining unused letters:  
D, G, H, Q, V, W, X, Z (plus any others not yet ruled out).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 2 and O in position 4.
- Uses only allowed letters for the other three positions.

Possible patterns:  
D I _ O _  
G I _ O _  
H I _ O _  
etc.

Let’s try common words that fit:
- “DINGO” – but N is ruled out.  
- “GIVEN” – N is ruled out.  
- “HIVOR” – not a valid word.  
- “WIDOW” – W, I, D, O, W.  
  Check letters: W, D are allowed; O is already confirmed.  
  This fits: W I D O W.

“WIDOW” uses only allowed letters and positions:
- W in 1 and 5 (both allowed).  
- I in 2 (correct).  
- D in 3 (allowed).  
- O in 4 (correct).  
- W in 5 (allowed).  

This seems to be the only common word that fits the constraints.
