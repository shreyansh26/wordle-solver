### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE,"" ""CRANE,"" ""AROSE,"" or ""ADIEU."" 

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it includes:
- C: Common consonant
- R: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- N: Common consonant
- E: Most common vowel

This should give good coverage of frequently used letters in English words.

- It contains R, but R is not in position 1 or 2 (from both CRANE and RADIO feedback)

1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

From the new feedback on RADIO:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) at position 2
- D, I, O are not in the word (x)

So we now know:
- The word has the pattern: _ A _ _ _
- It contains R, but R is not in position 1 or 2 (from both CRANE and RADIO feedback)
- Letters to avoid so far: C, N, E, D, I, O
- We still need to test other common consonants and vowels

Possible positions for R: 3, 4, or 5
Remaining vowels to test: U (since A is already confirmed)
Common consonants left: S, T, L, M, P, B, G, etc.

Let's try a word that places R in position 3 and tests new letters:
- S, T, L, M, P, U are candidates
- A good candidate is ""GRAFT"" but F hasn't been tested yet
- However, G, R, A, F, T: R is in position 2 (invalid from RADIO feedback)
- Next candidate: ""BRAGS"" - R in position 2 (invalid)
- ""FRANK"" - N is invalid
- ""TRAMP"" - P is new, R in position 2 (invalid)
- ""STARK"" - R in position 2 (invalid)
- ""GRAVY"" - Y is new, R in position 2 (invalid)
- ""CRAMP"" - C is invalid
- ""BRAWL"" - W is new, R in position 2 (invalid)
- ""PRANK"" - N is invalid
- ""GRASP"" - R in position 2 (invalid)
- ""BRAID"" - I is invalid
- ""RASPY"" - R in position 1 (invalid)
- ""RASPS"" - R in position 1 (invalid)
- ""RATIO"" - I, O are invalid
- ""RAINS"" - N is invalid
- ""RASPY"" - already considered
- ""RASPS"" - already considered
- ""RASPS"" - already considered
- ""RASPY"" - already considered

Let me think differently: R must be in position 3, 4, or 5
Try R in position 3: _ A R _ _
Possible words: ""BARRY"" - but Y is new, R in position 3
""CARAT"" - C is invalid
""BARDS"" - D is invalid
""PARAS"" - S is new, R in position 3
""PARAS"" seems valid: P, A, R, A, S - but A is already in position 2, and we can't have A again in position 4 without knowing
Wait, we don't know if A is repeated, but we can test new letters
""PARAS"" uses P, A, R, A, S - but the second A is untested
This might be risky

Better to test new letters without assuming duplicates
Try R in position 4: _ A _ R _
Possible words: ""GARRO"" - O is invalid
""BARTS"" - T, S are new, R in position 4
""BARTS"" seems valid: B, A, R, T, S - tests B, T, S
But R is in position 4 (valid)
""BARTS"" is a valid word

Let me check:
- B: new
- A: correct position
- R: in word, position 4 (not 1,2 - valid)
- T: new
- S: new
No forbidden letters (C,N,E,D,I,O)
This seems good

From the latest feedback on BARTS:
- B is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) at position 2
- R is in the word and in the correct position (✓) at position 3
- T is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)

So we now know the pattern: _ A R _ _

Letters we know are NOT in the word: C, N, E, D, I, O, B, T, S

Letters still possible for positions 1, 4, 5: any remaining consonants or vowels except the excluded ones.

Remaining common vowels: U
Remaining common consonants: F, G, H, K, L, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that fits _ A R _ _ with no forbidden letters.

Possible candidates:
- FARMY - but M and Y are possible, but F, A, R, M, Y: M and Y are allowed
- GARYS - but S is excluded
- HARRY - but Y is allowed, but R is already in position 3
- LARRY - but L and Y are allowed
- MARRY - but M and Y are allowed
- PARRY - but P and Y are allowed
- VARRY - but V and Y are allowed

Looking at these, ""LARRY"" seems good:
- L: new
- A: correct
- R: correct
- R: already in word
- Y: new

But we need to check if ""LARRY"" is valid - it is a valid word.

Another candidate is ""MARRY"":
- M: new
- A: correct
- R: correct
- R: already in word
- Y: new

Both are valid, but ""MARRY"" uses M and Y which are both untested.

Let's go with ""MARRY"" as it tests M and Y.
