1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because:
1. It includes very common letters (S, L, A, T, E)
2. These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words
3. It covers both vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T)

This should give us good initial feedback about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

- S: not in the word (x)
- L: in the word but wrong position (-)

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: L, E, R  
- Letters definitely out: S, A, T, D  
- E is locked at position 4  
- L cannot be in position 2  
- R cannot be in position 5  

We still need to test other common letters (N, I, O, C, etc.).  
We also need to place L and R somewhere else while keeping E fixed.

A good next word should:
1. Keep E in position 4.
2. Move L to a new position (3 or 5).
3. Move R to a new position (1, 2, or 3).
4. Introduce new common letters.

Candidate: CROWN  
- E is missing, so bad.  
Candidate: LIVER  
- E is in position 4, so positions 1-3 and 5 need to be filled with L, I, V, R.  
  - L would go in position 1 (new spot).  
  - I and V are new letters.  
  - R would go in position 5 (but feedback says R is not in position 5), so invalid.  

Candidate: ROLES  
- E is in position 4, so positions 1-3 and 5 need to be R, O, L, S.  
  - R in position 1 (new).  
  - O is new.  
  - L in position 3 (new).  
  - S is already ruled out.  

Candidate: RILED  
- D is ruled out.  

Candidate: RILEM  
- M is new, but RILEM isn't a common word.  

Candidate: RELIC  
- C is new.  
  - E is position 4.  
  - R in position 1 (new).  
  - E is already fixed.  
  - L in position 2 (but L can't be in position 2 from ELDER feedback).  

Candidate: RELIC is invalid because L would be in position 2 again.  

Candidate: LERCH  
- E is position 4, so L in 1, E in 4, R in 2, C and H new.  
  - L in position 1 (new).  
  - R in position 2 (new).  
  - C and H are new letters.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because:
1. It includes very common letters (S, L, A, T, E)
2. These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words
3. It covers both vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T)

This should give us good initial feedback about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

- L is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.
- We still need to test other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good next steps:
1. Keep L and E, but move them to new positions.
2. Introduce new common consonants and vowels not yet tested (like R, N, I, O, etc.).
3. Avoid S, A, T.

A strong candidate is ""ELDER"":
- Uses E and L in new positions (E in 1, L in 2).
- Adds D, R which are common and haven't been tested.

- R cannot be in position 5  

We still need to test other common letters (N, I, O, C, etc.).  
We also need to place L and R somewhere else while keeping E fixed.

A good next word should:
1. Keep E in position 4.
2. Move L to a new position (3 or 5).
3. Move R to a new position (1, 2, or 3).
4. Introduce new common letters.

Candidate: CROWN  
- E is missing, so bad.  
Candidate: LIVER  
- E is in position 4, so positions 1-3 and 5 need to be filled with L, I, V, R.  
  - L would go in position 1 (new spot).  
  - I and V are new letters.  
  - R would go in position 5 (but feedback says R is not in position 5), so invalid.  

Candidate: ROLES  
- E is in position 4, so positions 1-3 and 5 need to be R, O, L, S.  
  - R in position 1 (new).  
  - O is new.  
  - L in position 3 (new).  
  - S is already ruled out.  

Candidate: RILED  
- D is ruled out.  

Candidate: RILEM  
- M is new, but RILEM isn't a common word.  

Candidate: RELIC  
- C is new.  
  - E is position 4.  
  - R in position 1 (new).  
  - E is already fixed.  
  - L in position 2 (but L can't be in position 2 from ELDER feedback).  

Candidate: RELIC is invalid because L would be in position 2 again.  

Candidate: LERCH  
- E is position 4, so L in 1, E in 4, R in 2, C and H new.  
  - L in position 1 (new).  
  - R in position 2 (new).  
  - C and H are new letters.  
  - Word is valid.  

This seems like a strong candidate: it places L in position 1 (new), R in position 2 (new), keeps E in position 4, and introduces C and H.

Another check:  
- Letters in word: L, E, R, C, H  
- Letters ruled out: S, A, T, D  
- All positions are new for L and R.  

So ""LERCH"" is a good next guess.

Let's update what we now know after three guesses.

From Guess 1 (SLATE):  
- S, A, T are out.  
- L is in the word but not in position 2.  
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 2 (ELDER):  
- E is in position 4 (✓).  
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (already known) and not in position 1.  
- D is out.  
- R is in the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 3 (LERCH):  
- L is in the word but not in position 1.  
- E is confirmed in position 4.  
- R is in the word but not in position 3.  
- C and H are out.

So far we have:
- Letters in the word: L, E, R  
- Letters out: S, A, T, D, C, H  
- E is locked in position 4.  
- L cannot be in positions 1 or 2, so it must be in position 3 or 5.  
- R cannot be in positions 3 or 5, so it must be in position 1 or 2.

We need to place L and R in the remaining positions while introducing new common letters (O, I, N, etc.).

Possible positions:
- Position 1: R or new letter  
- Position 2: R or new letter  
- Position 3: L or new letter  
- Position 4: E (fixed)  
- Position 5: L or new letter  

Since L must be in 3 or 5, let's try:
- If L is in position 3, then R must be in position 1 or 2.  
- If L is in position 5, then R must be in position 1 or 2.

Let's test ""R O L E ?"" but we need a 5-letter word.  
""ROLLER"" is 6 letters.  
""R O L E Y"" is 5 letters but Y might be less common.  
""R O L E S"" has S which is out.  
""R O L E D"" has D which is out.  
""R O L E N"" is valid.  
But let's see if we can place L in position 5:  
""R O _ E L"" gives ""R O _ E L"" → ""ROBEL"" isn't a word.  
""R O _ E L"" → ""ROBEL"" isn't valid.  
""R I _ E L"" → ""R I _ E L"" → ""RIEEL"" isn't valid.  
""R I _ E L"" → ""R I _ E L"" → ""RIEEL"" isn't valid.  
""R I _ E L"" → ""R I _ E L"" → ""RIEEL"" isn't valid.  

Alternative: L in position 3, R in position 1 → ""R _ L E _""  
Possible word: ""R I L E N""  
Check if this is valid: ""RILEN"" is not a common word.  
""R O L E N"" is valid (variant spelling of ""rolen"" or ""rulen"" in some contexts, but may not be in standard Wordle lists).  
""R I L E N"" is not standard.  
""R O L E N"" seems the closest.

Another approach: L in position 5, R in position 1 → ""R _ _ E L""  
Possible word: ""R I V E L"" → ""RIVEL"" isn't valid.  
""R O V E L"" → ""ROVEL"" isn't valid.  
""R I N E L"" → ""RINEL"" isn't valid.  

Let's try R in position 2, L in position 3 → ""_ R L E _""  
Possible word: ""B R L E E"" → invalid.  
""O R L E E"" → invalid.  
""O R L E E"" → invalid.  
""O R L E E"" → invalid.  

Actually, let's list possible words with E in position 4, L in 3 or 5, R in 1 or 2, and new letters:

Case 1: L in position 3, R in position 1 → ""R _ L E _""  
Possible word: ""R I L E N"" (not standard).  
""R O L E N"" (not standard).  
""R U L E N"" (not standard).  

Case 2: L in position 3, R in position 2 → ""_ R L E _""  
Possible word: ""O R L E N"" (not standard).  
""B R L E N"" (not standard).  

Case 3: L in position 5, R in position 1 → ""R _ _ E L""  
Possible word: ""R I V E L"" (not standard).  
""R O V E L"" (not standard).  
""R I N E L"" (not standard).  

Case 4: L in position 5, R in position 2 → ""_ R _ E L""  
Possible word: ""O R I E L"" → ""ORIEL"" is a valid word (means a view or opening in a wall, and is in Wordle lists).  
Check positions:  
- O (new)  
- R (position 2)  
- I (new)  
- E (position 4)  
- L (position 5)  

This fits all constraints:  
- E is in position 4 (✓).  
- L is in position 5 (allowed, since L can't be in 1 or 2).  
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since R can't be in 3 or 5).  
- O and I are new letters not yet tested.  

""ORIEL"" seems like the best next guess.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because:
1. It includes very common letters (S, L, A, T, E)
2. These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words
3. It covers both vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T)

This should give us good initial feedback about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- T: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains L and E, but not S, A, or T.
- L is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.
- We still need to test other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good next steps:
1. Keep L and E, but move them to new positions.
2. Introduce new common consonants and vowels not yet tested (like R, N, I, O, etc.).
3. Avoid S, A, T.

A strong candidate is ""ELDER"":
- Uses E and L in new positions (E in 1, L in 2).
- Adds D, R which are common and haven't been tested.
- Avoids all ruled-out letters (S, A, T).

This should help confirm or deny the positions of L and E while testing new letters.

Let's digest the new feedback on ELDER:

E(-)  → E is in the word but NOT in position 1  
L(-)  → L is in the word but NOT in position 2  
D(x)  → D is NOT in the word  
E(✓)  → E is in position 4 (correct spot)  
R(-)  → R is in the word but NOT in position 5  

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: L, E, R  
- Letters definitely out: S, A, T, D  
- E is locked at position 4  
- L cannot be in position 2  
- R cannot be in position 5  

We still need to test other common letters (N, I, O, C, etc.).  
We also need to place L and R somewhere else while keeping E fixed.

A good next word should:
1. Keep E in position 4.
2. Move L to a new position (3 or 5).
3. Move R to a new position (1, 2, or 3).
4. Introduce new common letters.

Candidate: CROWN  
- E is missing, so bad.  
Candidate: LIVER  
- E is in position 4, so positions 1-3 and 5 need to be filled with L, I, V, R.  
  - L would go in position 1 (new spot).  
  - I and V are new letters.  
  - R would go in position 5 (but feedback says R is not in position 5), so invalid.  

Candidate: ROLES  
- E is in position 4, so positions 1-3 and 5 need to be R, O, L, S.  
  - R in position 1 (new).  
  - O is new.  
  - L in position 3 (new).  
  - S is already ruled out.  

Candidate: RILED  
- D is ruled out.  

Candidate: RILEM  
- M is new, but RILEM isn't a common word.  

Candidate: RELIC  
- C is new.  
  - E is position 4.  
  - R in position 1 (new).  
  - E is already fixed.  
  - L in position 2 (but L can't be in position 2 from ELDER feedback).  

Candidate: RELIC is invalid because L would be in position 2 again.  

Candidate: LERCH  
- E is position 4, so L in 1, E in 4, R in 2, C and H new.  
  - L in position 1 (new).  
  - R in position 2 (new).  
  - C and H are new letters.  
  - Word is valid.  

This seems like a strong candidate: it places L in position 1 (new), R in position 2 (new), keeps E in position 4, and introduces C and H.

Another check:  
- Letters in word: L, E, R, C, H  
- Letters ruled out: S, A, T, D  
- All positions are new for L and R.  

So ""LERCH"" is a good next guess.

- Letters out: S, A, T, D, C, H  
- E is locked in position 4.  
- L cannot be in positions 1 or 2, so it must be in position 3 or 5.  
- R cannot be in positions 3 or 5, so it must be in position 1 or 2.

We need to place L and R in the remaining positions while introducing new common letters (O, I, N, etc.).

Possible positions:
- Position 1: R or new letter  
- Position 2: R or new letter  
- Position 3: L or new letter  
- Position 4: E (fixed)  
- Position 5: L or new letter  

Since L must be in 3 or 5, let's try:
- If L is in position 3, then R must be in position 1 or 2.  
- If L is in position 5, then R must be in position 1 or 2.

Let's test ""R O L E ?"" but we need a 5-letter word.  
""ROLLER"" is 6 letters.  
""R O L E Y"" is 5 letters but Y might be less common.  
""R O L E S"" has S which is out.  
""R O L E D"" has D which is out.  
""R O L E N"" is valid.  
But let's see if we can place L in position 5:  
""R O _ E L"" gives ""R O _ E L"" → ""ROBEL"" isn't a word.  
""R O _ E L"" → ""ROBEL"" isn't valid.  
""R I _ E L"" → ""R I _ E L"" → ""RIEEL"" isn't valid.  
""R I _ E L"" → ""R I _ E L"" → ""RIEEL"" isn't valid.  
""R I _ E L"" → ""R I _ E L"" → ""RIEEL"" isn't valid.  

Alternative: L in position 3, R in position 1 → ""R _ L E _""  
Possible word: ""R I L E N""  
Check if this is valid: ""RILEN"" is not a common word.  
""R O L E N"" is valid (variant spelling of ""rolen"" or ""rulen"" in some contexts, but may not be in standard Wordle lists).  
""R I L E N"" is not standard.  
""R O L E N"" seems the closest.

Another approach: L in position 5, R in position 1 → ""R _ _ E L""  
Possible word: ""R I V E L"" → ""RIVEL"" isn't valid.  
""R O V E L"" → ""ROVEL"" isn't valid.  
""R I N E L"" → ""RINEL"" isn't valid.  

Let's try R in position 2, L in position 3 → ""_ R L E _""  
Possible word: ""B R L E E"" → invalid.  
""O R L E E"" → invalid.  
""O R L E E"" → invalid.  
""O R L E E"" → invalid.  

Actually, let's list possible words with E in position 4, L in 3 or 5, R in 1 or 2, and new letters:

Case 1: L in position 3, R in position 1 → ""R _ L E _""  
Possible word: ""R I L E N"" (not standard).  
""R O L E N"" (not standard).  
""R U L E N"" (not standard).  

Case 2: L in position 3, R in position 2 → ""_ R L E _""  
Possible word: ""O R L E N"" (not standard).  
""B R L E N"" (not standard).  

Case 3: L in position 5, R in position 1 → ""R _ _ E L""  
Possible word: ""R I V E L"" (not standard).  
""R O V E L"" (not standard).  
""R I N E L"" (not standard).  

Case 4: L in position 5, R in position 2 → ""_ R _ E L""  
Possible word: ""O R I E L"" → ""ORIEL"" is a valid word (means a view or opening in a wall, and is in Wordle lists).  
Check positions:  
- O (new)  
- R (position 2)  
- I (new)  
- E (position 4)  
- L (position 5)  

This fits all constraints:  
- E is in position 4 (✓).  
- L is in position 5 (allowed, since L can't be in 1 or 2).  
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since R can't be in 3 or 5).  
- O and I are new letters not yet tested.  

""ORIEL"" seems like the best next guess.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (covers A, D, I, E, U)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""SLATE"" is particularly good because:
1. It includes very common letters (S, L, A, T, E)
2. These letters appear frequently in 5-letter words
3. It covers both vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T)

This should give us good initial feedback about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(-) A(x) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: not in the word (x)
- T: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains L and E, but not S, A, or T.
- L is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.
- We still need to test other common letters to narrow down possibilities.

Good next steps:
1. Keep L and E, but move them to new positions.
2. Introduce new common consonants and vowels not yet tested (like R, N, I, O, etc.).
3. Avoid S, A, T.

A strong candidate is ""ELDER"":
- Uses E and L in new positions (E in 1, L in 2).
- Adds D, R which are common and haven't been tested.
- Avoids all ruled-out letters (S, A, T).

This should help confirm or deny the positions of L and E while testing new letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ELDER -> FEEDBACK: E(-) L(-) D(x) E(✓) R(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's digest the new feedback on ELDER:

E(-)  → E is in the word but NOT in position 1  
L(-)  → L is in the word but NOT in position 2  
D(x)  → D is NOT in the word  
E(✓)  → E is in position 4 (correct spot)  
R(-)  → R is in the word but NOT in position 5  

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: L, E, R  
- Letters definitely out: S, A, T, D  
- E is locked at position 4  
- L cannot be in position 2  
- R cannot be in position 5  

We still need to test other common letters (N, I, O, C, etc.).  
We also need to place L and R somewhere else while keeping E fixed.

A good next word should:
1. Keep E in position 4.
2. Move L to a new position (3 or 5).
3. Move R to a new position (1, 2, or 3).
4. Introduce new common letters.

Candidate: CROWN  
- E is missing, so bad.  
Candidate: LIVER  
- E is in position 4, so positions 1-3 and 5 need to be filled with L, I, V, R.  
  - L would go in position 1 (new spot).  
  - I and V are new letters.  
  - R would go in position 5 (but feedback says R is not in position 5), so invalid.  

Candidate: ROLES  
- E is in position 4, so positions 1-3 and 5 need to be R, O, L, S.  
  - R in position 1 (new).  
  - O is new.  
  - L in position 3 (new).  
  - S is already ruled out.  

Candidate: RILED  
- D is ruled out.  

Candidate: RILEM  
- M is new, but RILEM isn't a common word.  

Candidate: RELIC  
- C is new.  
  - E is position 4.  
  - R in position 1 (new).  
  - E is already fixed.  
  - L in position 2 (but L can't be in position 2 from ELDER feedback).  

Candidate: RELIC is invalid because L would be in position 2 again.  

Candidate: LERCH  
- E is position 4, so L in 1, E in 4, R in 2, C and H new.  
  - L in position 1 (new).  
  - R in position 2 (new).  
  - C and H are new letters.  
  - Word is valid.  

This seems like a strong candidate: it places L in position 1 (new), R in position 2 (new), keeps E in position 4, and introduces C and H.

Another check:  
- Letters in word: L, E, R, C, H  
- Letters ruled out: S, A, T, D  
- All positions are new for L and R.  

So ""LERCH"" is a good next guess.

Let's update what we now know after three guesses.

From Guess 1 (SLATE):  
- S, A, T are out.  
- L is in the word but not in position 2.  
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 2 (ELDER):  
- E is in position 4 (✓).  
- L is in the word but not in position 2 (already known) and not in position 1.  
- D is out.  
- R is in the word but not in position 5.

From Guess 3 (LERCH):  
- L is in the word but not in position 1.  
- E is confirmed in position 4.  
- R is in the word but not in position 3.  
- C and H are out.

So far we have:
- Letters in the word: L, E, R  
- Letters out: S, A, T, D, C, H  
- E is locked in position 4.  
- L cannot be in positions 1 or 2, so it must be in position 3 or 5.  
- R cannot be in positions 3 or 5, so it must be in position 1 or 2.

We need to place L and R in the remaining positions while introducing new common letters (O, I, N, etc.).

Possible positions:
- Position 1: R or new letter  
- Position 2: R or new letter  
- Position 3: L or new letter  
- Position 4: E (fixed)  
- Position 5: L or new letter  

Since L must be in 3 or 5, let's try:
- If L is in position 3, then R must be in position 1 or 2.  
- If L is in position 5, then R must be in position 1 or 2.

Let's test ""R O L E ?"" but we need a 5-letter word.  
""ROLLER"" is 6 letters.  
""R O L E Y"" is 5 letters but Y might be less common.  
""R O L E S"" has S which is out.  
""R O L E D"" has D which is out.  
""R O L E N"" is valid.  
But let's see if we can place L in position 5:  
""R O _ E L"" gives ""R O _ E L"" → ""ROBEL"" isn't a word.  
""R O _ E L"" → ""ROBEL"" isn't valid.  
""R I _ E L"" → ""R I _ E L"" → ""RIEEL"" isn't valid.  
""R I _ E L"" → ""R I _ E L"" → ""RIEEL"" isn't valid.  
""R I _ E L"" → ""R I _ E L"" → ""RIEEL"" isn't valid.  

Alternative: L in position 3, R in position 1 → ""R _ L E _""  
Possible word: ""R I L E N""  
Check if this is valid: ""RILEN"" is not a common word.  
""R O L E N"" is valid (variant spelling of ""rolen"" or ""rulen"" in some contexts, but may not be in standard Wordle lists).  
""R I L E N"" is not standard.  
""R O L E N"" seems the closest.

Another approach: L in position 5, R in position 1 → ""R _ _ E L""  
Possible word: ""R I V E L"" → ""RIVEL"" isn't valid.  
""R O V E L"" → ""ROVEL"" isn't valid.  
""R I N E L"" → ""RINEL"" isn't valid.  

Let's try R in position 2, L in position 3 → ""_ R L E _""  
Possible word: ""B R L E E"" → invalid.  
""O R L E E"" → invalid.  
""O R L E E"" → invalid.  
""O R L E E"" → invalid.  

Actually, let's list possible words with E in position 4, L in 3 or 5, R in 1 or 2, and new letters:

Case 1: L in position 3, R in position 1 → ""R _ L E _""  
Possible word: ""R I L E N"" (not standard).  
""R O L E N"" (not standard).  
""R U L E N"" (not standard).  

Case 2: L in position 3, R in position 2 → ""_ R L E _""  
Possible word: ""O R L E N"" (not standard).  
""B R L E N"" (not standard).  

Case 3: L in position 5, R in position 1 → ""R _ _ E L""  
Possible word: ""R I V E L"" (not standard).  
""R O V E L"" (not standard).  
""R I N E L"" (not standard).  

Case 4: L in position 5, R in position 2 → ""_ R _ E L""  
Possible word: ""O R I E L"" → ""ORIEL"" is a valid word (means a view or opening in a wall, and is in Wordle lists).  
Check positions:  
- O (new)  
- R (position 2)  
- I (new)  
- E (position 4)  
- L (position 5)  

This fits all constraints:  
- E is in position 4 (✓).  
- L is in position 5 (allowed, since L can't be in 1 or 2).  
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since R can't be in 3 or 5).  
- O and I are new letters not yet tested.  

""ORIEL"" seems like the best next guess.

Let's consolidate what we now know after four guesses.

Letters in the word (confirmed): L, E, R  
Letters ruled out: S, A, T, D, C, H, O, I  
Positions we know:
- E is in position 4 (✓ from ELDER and ORIEL)
- L is in position 5 (✓ from ORIEL)
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from ELDER and ORIEL feedback)  
  Therefore R must be in position 1 or 2.

Current skeleton:  
[ _ / R ] [ _ ] [ _ ] E L  

We need a 5-letter word ending in ""EL"" with E in position 4 and L in position 5, and R somewhere in positions 1 or 2.

Possible patterns:
1. R _ _ E L
2. _ R _ E L

We still need to test common letters not yet used: N, U, M, G, B, F, K, etc.

Let's try pattern 1: R _ _ E L  
Possible valid words:  
- R U N E L → ""RUNEL"" (not standard)  
- R U M E L → ""RUMEL"" (not standard)  
- R U B E L → ""RUBEL"" (not standard)  
- R U N E L → ""RUNEL"" (not standard)  
- R I N E L → ""RINEL"" (not standard)  

Pattern 2: _ R _ E L  
Possible valid words:  
- B R I E L → ""BRIEL"" (not standard)  
- B R U E L → ""BRUEL"" (not standard)  
- F R U E L → ""FRUEL"" (not standard)  
- G R U E L → ""GRUEL"" (valid word meaning a thick drink or food)  
- M R U E L → ""MRUEL"" (not valid)  

""GRUEL"" fits perfectly:
- G (new letter)  
- R in position 2 (allowed)  
- U (new letter)  
- E in position 4 (✓)  
- L in position 5 (✓)  

All constraints satisfied.

The pattern is now: R _ E L, and the blank must be a new letter.
