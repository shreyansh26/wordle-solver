For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (second most common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 1).
- A, I, S are NOT in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 5).

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: A, I, S
- Letters to keep: R, E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively)

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and E (but not in positions 1 and 5).
2. Does NOT contain A, I, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A and I are out).

Let's try to place R and E in new positions:
- R cannot be in position 1, so possible positions: 2,3,4,5
- E cannot be in position 5, so possible positions: 1,2,3,4

A good candidate is ""ROUTE"":
- R is in position 1 (but we know R is not in position 1 from feedback), so this is bad.

Another candidate is ""ENTRY"":
- Contains E and N, T, R, Y. But we know E is not in position 5 (which it isn't here) and R is not in position 1 (which it isn't here). However, this has N, T, Y which are good letters. But we need to check if it meets all criteria:
  - Letters: E, N, T, R, Y
  - Excludes A, I, S - good
  - R is in position 4 (not 1) - good
  - E is in position 1 (not 5) - good

This seems valid. Let's go with ENTRY.

But wait, is ENTRY a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

Alternative: ""TOWER""
- T, O, W, E, R
- Excludes A, I, S - good
- R is in position 5 (not 1) - good
- E is in position 4 (not 5) - good

Between ENTRY and TOWER, both are good, but TOWER uses O which is a common vowel we haven't tested yet. Let's go with TOWER.

But let me double-check:
- TOWER: T, O, W, E, R
- R is in position 5 (allowed)
- E is in position 4 (allowed)
- No A, I, S - good
- Uses O, W, T - good letters

4. We need three more letters (positions 1, 3) chosen from the remaining alphabet, excluding the forbidden letters.

5. Common remaining consonants that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z  
   Common remaining vowels: U (since A, I, O, E are either used or ruled out)

6. To maximize information, we want a word that:

   - Uses fresh common letters
   - Doesn’t repeat any already-confirmed letters

Let’s try “POWER”:
- P, O, W, E, R
- But W is already ruled out (from TOWER feedback), so POWER is invalid.

Next try “FORER” – but that’s not a valid English word.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (second most common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 1).
- A, I, S are NOT in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 5).

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: A, I, S
- Letters to keep: R, E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively)

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and E (but not in positions 1 and 5).
2. Does NOT contain A, I, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A and I are out).

Let's try to place R and E in new positions:
- R cannot be in position 1, so possible positions: 2,3,4,5
- E cannot be in position 5, so possible positions: 1,2,3,4

A good candidate is ""ROUTE"":
- R is in position 1 (but we know R is not in position 1 from feedback), so this is bad.

Another candidate is ""ENTRY"":
- Contains E and N, T, R, Y. But we know E is not in position 5 (which it isn't here) and R is not in position 1 (which it isn't here). However, this has N, T, Y which are good letters. But we need to check if it meets all criteria:
  - Letters: E, N, T, R, Y
  - Excludes A, I, S - good
  - R is in position 4 (not 1) - good
  - E is in position 1 (not 5) - good

This seems valid. Let's go with ENTRY.

But wait, is ENTRY a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

Alternative: ""TOWER""
- T, O, W, E, R
- Excludes A, I, S - good
- R is in position 5 (not 1) - good
- E is in position 4 (not 5) - good
- Uses O, W, T which are good letters

Between ENTRY and TOWER, both are good, but TOWER uses O which is a common vowel we haven't tested yet. Let's go with TOWER.

But let me double-check:
- TOWER: T, O, W, E, R
- R is in position 5 (allowed)
- E is in position 4 (allowed)
- No A, I, S - good
- Uses O, W, T - good letters

Yes, TOWER is a good next guess.

Guess 2: TOWER -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters definitely in the word and their correct positions:
   - O in position 2
   - E in position 4
   - R in position 5

2. Letters definitely NOT in the word at all:
   - A, I, S, T, W

3. Therefore the word must be of the form: _ O _ E R
   and may not contain A, I, S, T, W.

4. We need three more letters (positions 1, 3) chosen from the remaining alphabet, excluding the forbidden letters.

5. Common remaining consonants that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z  
   Common remaining vowels: U (since A, I, O, E are either used or ruled out)

6. To maximize information, we want a word that:
   - Fits _ O _ E R
   - Uses fresh common letters
   - Doesn’t repeat any already-confirmed letters

Let’s try “POWER”:
- P, O, W, E, R
- But W is already ruled out (from TOWER feedback), so POWER is invalid.

Next try “FORER” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Try “GONER”:
- G, O, N, E, R
- All letters allowed (G, N not yet tested), and it fits _ O _ E R.

Check: G, O, N, E, R – no forbidden letters, valid English word.

This seems optimal.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because it includes:

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are:

- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- AUDIO (A, U, D, I, O)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (second most common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This gives us good coverage of common letters and positions to help narrow down possibilities quickly.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 1).
- A, I, S are NOT in the word at all.
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 5).

So we know:
- Letters to exclude: A, I, S
- Letters to keep: R, E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively)

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and E (but not in positions 1 and 5).
2. Does NOT contain A, I, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A and I are out).

Let's try to place R and E in new positions:
- R cannot be in position 1, so possible positions: 2,3,4,5
- E cannot be in position 5, so possible positions: 1,2,3,4

A good candidate is ""ROUTE"":
- R is in position 1 (but we know R is not in position 1 from feedback), so this is bad.

Another candidate is ""ENTRY"":
- Contains E and N, T, R, Y. But we know E is not in position 5 (which it isn't here) and R is not in position 1 (which it isn't here). However, this has N, T, Y which are good letters. But we need to check if it meets all criteria:
  - Letters: E, N, T, R, Y
  - Excludes A, I, S - good
  - R is in position 4 (not 1) - good
  - E is in position 1 (not 5) - good

This seems valid. Let's go with ENTRY.

But wait, is ENTRY a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

Alternative: ""TOWER""
- T, O, W, E, R
- Excludes A, I, S - good
- R is in position 5 (not 1) - good
- E is in position 4 (not 5) - good
- Uses O, W, T which are good letters

Between ENTRY and TOWER, both are good, but TOWER uses O which is a common vowel we haven't tested yet. Let's go with TOWER.

But let me double-check:
- TOWER: T, O, W, E, R
- R is in position 5 (allowed)
- E is in position 4 (allowed)
- No A, I, S - good
- Uses O, W, T - good letters

Yes, TOWER is a good next guess.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters definitely in the word and their correct positions:
   - O in position 2
   - E in position 4
   - R in position 5

2. Letters definitely NOT in the word at all:
   - A, I, S, T, W

3. Therefore the word must be of the form: _ O _ E R
   and may not contain A, I, S, T, W.

4. We need three more letters (positions 1, 3) chosen from the remaining alphabet, excluding the forbidden letters.

5. Common remaining consonants that haven’t been ruled out: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z  
   Common remaining vowels: U (since A, I, O, E are either used or ruled out)

6. To maximize information, we want a word that:
   - Fits _ O _ E R
   - Uses fresh common letters
   - Doesn’t repeat any already-confirmed letters

Let’s try “POWER”:
- P, O, W, E, R
- But W is already ruled out (from TOWER feedback), so POWER is invalid.

Next try “FORER” – but that’s not a valid English word.

Try “GONER”:
- G, O, N, E, R
- All letters allowed (G, N not yet tested), and it fits _ O _ E R.

Check: G, O, N, E, R – no forbidden letters, valid English word.

This seems optimal.

- X O C E R – XOCER (not a word)  
- Y O C E R – YOCER (not a word)  
- Z O C E R – ZOCER (not a word)  

After scanning the dictionary, the only common valid word left is:

- BORED – but this is B O R E D (E is in position 4, R in position 5, but we need O in position 2, so pattern _ O _ E R – B O R E D doesn’t fit)  

Wait, let’s re-express the pattern:  
_ O _ E R means position 1: ?, position 2: O, position 3: ?, position 4: E, position 5: R.  

So the word must be of the form: ? O ? E R  

Looking up valid 5-letter words matching ?O?ER:

- BODER – not a word  
- BOWER – W eliminated  
- CODER – invalid  
- DOPER – D, O, P, E, R – all allowed letters, and DOPER is a valid word (short for “doper” – slang for drug user, or “doper” in sports).  

Check: D, O, P, E, R – none of A, I, S, T, W, G, N appear.  
DOPER is a valid 5-letter word.

Let’s use DOPER.
