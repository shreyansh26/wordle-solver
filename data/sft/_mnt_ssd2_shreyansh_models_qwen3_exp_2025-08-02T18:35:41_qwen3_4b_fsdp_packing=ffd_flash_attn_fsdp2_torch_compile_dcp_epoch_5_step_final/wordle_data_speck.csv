Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible about the letters in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize the chance of hitting letters that are in the word.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- 3 common vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
This will help me quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Another strong candidate is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons, but ""AROSE"" has slightly better letter frequency coverage according to Wordle analysis. I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Yes, ""SPECK"" seems good.

But let me think of another word: ""SWEET"" – but T is eliminated.

""SHEDS"" – but D is new, S is already used.

""SHELF"" – but F is new.

""SHELF"" seems good:
- S (✓) 1st
- H (new)
- E (✓) 3rd
- L (new)
- F (new)

This tests H, L, F which are all new letters.

Yes, ""SHELF"" seems optimal.

Current state:
- Word pattern: S _ E _ _
- Letters confirmed: S (position 1), E (position 3)
- Eliminated letters: A, R, O, T, I, N, H, L, F
- Remaining common consonants: D, C, G, B, M, P, Y
- Remaining vowels: U (since A, O, I, E are handled)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Starts with S
2. Has E in the 3rd position
3. Uses only letters not yet eliminated
4. Introduces new letters to maximize information

Possible candidates:
- SCENE – but N is eliminated
- SPECK – but P, C, K are new letters
- SUEDE – but U, D are new, but E is already used
- SUGAR – but U, G, A, R – A and R are eliminated
- SUDSY – but D, S, Y are new, but S is already used

""SPECK"" seems good because:
- S (position 1) ✓
- P (new)
- E (position 3) ✓
- C (new)
- K (new)

This tests three new letters (P, C, K) while maintaining the known pattern.

Another option is ""SUGAR"" but A and R are eliminated, so it's invalid.
""SUDSY"" tests S, U, D, S, Y but S is already known and may not add much info.

""SPECK"" seems optimal.
