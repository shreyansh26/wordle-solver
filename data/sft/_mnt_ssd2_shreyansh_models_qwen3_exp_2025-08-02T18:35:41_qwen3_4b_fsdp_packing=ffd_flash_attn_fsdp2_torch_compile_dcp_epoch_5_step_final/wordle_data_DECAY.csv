For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, T, R, S, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can quickly narrow down the possibilities based on which letters are present or absent.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(x): R is NOT in the word.
- O(x): O is NOT the word.
- S(x): S is NOT the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but in the wrong position (not 5th).

So we know:
- The word contains A and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and E in different positions (not 1st and 5th).
2. Avoids R, O, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, etc.

A word that fits: ""TALKE"" – but ""TALKE"" isn't valid. ""TALKE"" isn't a recognized English word.

Let me think of valid words. ""TALKE"" is invalid, but ""TALKE"" isn't a word. How about ""TENET""? It uses T, E, N, E, T – but repeats E and T. Also, it doesn't use A.

""TABLE"" – uses T, A, B, L, E. It places A in position 2 and E in position 5. But E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5, so E can't be in position 5. Therefore ""TABLE"" is invalid because E would be in position 5.

""TALEN"" – uses T, A, L, E, N. A is in position 2 (not 1), E is in position 4 (not 5). This avoids R, O, S and places A and E in new positions. This seems valid.

""TALEN"" is a valid English word meaning a skilled worker or a small group of people working together.

Let me check: T A L E N – positions: A is 2nd (not 1st), E is 4th (not 5th). No R, O, S. This seems good.

Another option: ""TACET"" – uses T, A, C, E, T. A is 2nd, E is 4th. Also valid, but repeats T.

""TALENT"" is 6 letters, so invalid.

""TALEN"" seems best.

- N(x) → N is NOT in the word.

Summary of what we know so far:
- Letters in the word: A, E (both must appear somewhere, but not in the positions already tried).
- Letters ruled out: R, O, S, T, L, N.
- Remaining common letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and E.
2. A is not in position 1 or 2.
3. E is not in position 4 or 5.
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible positions for A: 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3

Let's try to construct a word:
- E in position 1: E _ _ _ _
- A in position 3: _ E A _ _
- Need two more letters from the remaining pool (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y).

A good candidate: ""EACHY"" – but Y is sometimes acceptable, and ""EACHY"" isn't a standard word.
""EACH"" is 4 letters.
""EAGER"" – contains R (ruled out).
""EAT"" – too short.
""EAVES"" – contains S (ruled out).
""ELENA"" – contains L (ruled out) and N (ruled out).
""HEAVE"" – H, E, A, V, E. A is in position 3, E in positions 2 and 5. This fits all constraints:
  - Contains A and E.
  - A not in 1 or 2 (it's 3).
  - E not in 4 or 5 (it's 2 and 5, but 5 is excluded, so this is invalid because E is in 5).
So ""HEAVE"" is invalid.

Next candidate: ""EATEN"" – contains N (ruled out).
""EBBING"" – too long.
""EARLY"" – contains L (ruled out).
""EASED"" – contains S (ruled out).
""EATER"" – contains T and R (ruled out).
""EBONY"" – contains N (ruled out) and Y is questionable.
""ECHELON"" – too long.
""EMCEE"" – contains C twice and E in 2 and 5 (invalid for E in 5).
""EMBED"" – contains D and B, E in 2 and 5 (invalid for E in 5).
""EMCEE"" is invalid for E in 5.

Let's try E in position 1 and A in position 4 or 5:
""E _ _ A _"" or ""E _ _ _ A"".
But E can't be in 5, and A can't be in 1 or 2.

""E _ A _ _"" – A in 3, E in 1 or 2.
""E A _ _ _"" – A in 2 (invalid).

""E _ _ _ A"" – A in 5, E in 1 or 2.
""E _ _ A _"" – A in 4, E in 1 or 2.

Let's try ""EACHY"" – invalid.
""EMBED"" – E in 1, M, B, E in 2 (invalid for E in 2 and 5).
""EBB"" – too short.
""EJECT"" – contains T (ruled out).
""EVOKE"" – contains O (ruled out).
""EVOKE"" invalid.

""EPIPHANY"" – too long.
""EQUIP"" – contains U and I, P, E in 4 (invalid for E in 4).

""EPIPHANY"" invalid.

""EJECT"" invalid.

""EVOKE"" invalid.

""EPIPHANY"" invalid.

""EQUIP"" invalid.

""EPIPHANY"" invalid.

""EPIPHANY"" invalid.

Let me think differently: use remaining letters B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a word with A and E, avoiding positions already ruled out.

Try ""BEACH"" – 5 letters, B, E, A, C, H. A is in 3, E is in 2. This fits:
- Contains A (3) and E (2).
- A not in 1 or 2 (it's 3).
- E not in 4 or 5 (it's 2).
- Uses only allowed letters (B, E, A, C, H).

""BEACH"" seems valid.

Let me verify:
- B: allowed
- E: allowed (not in 4 or 5, it's 2)
- A: allowed (not in 1 or 2, it's 3)
- C: allowed
- H: allowed
- No R, O, S, T, L, N.

This looks good.

Another candidate: ""PEACH"" – same letters, P instead of B. Also valid.

""PEACH"" is also a good choice.

Between BEACH and PEACH, both are valid. I'll choose PEACH.

""E A _ _ _"" – A in 2 (invalid).

""E _ _ _ A"" – A in 5, E in 1 or 2.
""E _ _ A _"" – A in 4, E in 1 or 2.

Let's try ""EACHY"" – invalid.
""EMBED"" – E in 1, M, B, E in 2 (invalid for E in 2 and 5).
""EBB"" – too short.
""EJECT"" – contains T (ruled out).
""EVOKE"" – contains O (ruled out).
""EVOKE"" invalid.

""EPIPHANY"" – too long.
""EQUIP"" – contains U and I, P, E in 4 (invalid for E in 4).

""EPIPHANY"" invalid.

""EJECT"" invalid.

""EVOKE"" invalid.

""EPIPHANY"" invalid.

""EQUIP"" invalid.

""EPIPHANY"" invalid.

""EPIPHANY"" invalid.

Let me think differently: use remaining letters B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a word with A and E, avoiding positions already ruled out.

Try ""BEACH"" – 5 letters, B, E, A, C, H. A is in 3, E is in 2. This fits:
- Contains A (3) and E (2).
- A not in 1 or 2 (it's 3).
- E not in 4 or 5 (it's 2).
- Uses only allowed letters (B, E, A, C, H).

""BEACH"" seems valid.

Let me verify:
- B: allowed
- E: allowed (not in 4 or 5, it's 2)
- A: allowed (not in 1 or 2, it's 3)
- C: allowed
- H: allowed
- No R, O, S, T, L, N.

This looks good.

Another candidate: ""PEACH"" – same letters, P instead of B. Also valid.

""PEACH"" is also a good choice.

Between BEACH and PEACH, both are valid. I'll choose PEACH.",Guess 3: PEACH -> FEEDBACK: P(x) E(✓) A(-) C(-) H(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, T, R, S, etc. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains 5 very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can quickly narrow down the possibilities based on which letters are present or absent.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-): A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 1st).
- R(x): R is NOT in the word.
- O(x): O is NOT the word.
- S(x): S is NOT the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but in the wrong position (not 5th).

So we know:
- The word contains A and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, or S.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Uses A and E in different positions (not 1st and 5th).
2. Avoids R, O, S.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common letters: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, etc.

A word that fits: ""TALKE"" – but ""TALKE"" isn't valid. ""TALKE"" isn't a recognized English word.

Let me think of valid words. ""TALKE"" is invalid, but ""TALKE"" isn't a word. How about ""TENET""? It uses T, E, N, E, T – but repeats E and T. Also, it doesn't use A.

""TABLE"" – uses T, A, B, L, E. It places A in position 2 and E in position 5. But E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5, so E can't be in position 5. Therefore ""TABLE"" is invalid because E would be in position 5.

""TALEN"" – uses T, A, L, E, N. A is in position 2 (not 1), E is in position 4 (not 5). This avoids R, O, S and places A and E in new positions. This seems valid.

""TALEN"" is a valid English word meaning a skilled worker or a small group of people working together.

Let me check: T A L E N – positions: A is 2nd (not 1st), E is 4th (not 5th). No R, O, S. This seems good.

Another option: ""TACET"" – uses T, A, C, E, T. A is 2nd, E is 4th. Also valid, but repeats T.

""TALENT"" is 6 letters, so invalid.

""TALEN"" seems best.

Guess 2: taLEN -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) L(x) E(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ""taLEN"":
- T(x) → T is NOT in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 2 (it was in position 2 before, so now we know it's not 2nd).
- L(x) → L is NOT in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 4 (it was in position 5 before, so now we know it's not 5th and not 4th).
- N(x) → N is NOT in the word.

Summary of what we know so far:
- Letters in the word: A, E (both must appear somewhere, but not in the positions already tried).
- Letters ruled out: R, O, S, T, L, N.
- Remaining common letters to try: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and E.
2. A is not in position 1 or 2.
3. E is not in position 4 or 5.
4. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Possible positions for A: 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 1, 2, 3

Let's try to construct a word:
- E in position 1: E _ _ _ _
- A in position 3: _ E A _ _
- Need two more letters from the remaining pool (B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y).

A good candidate: ""EACHY"" – but Y is sometimes acceptable, and ""EACHY"" isn't a standard word.
""EACH"" is 4 letters.
""EAGER"" – contains R (ruled out).
""EAT"" – too short.
""EAVES"" – contains S (ruled out).
""ELENA"" – contains L (ruled out) and N (ruled out).
""HEAVE"" – H, E, A, V, E. A is in position 3, E in positions 2 and 5. This fits all constraints:
  - Contains A and E.
  - A not in 1 or 2 (it's 3).
  - E not in 4 or 5 (it's 2 and 5, but 5 is excluded, so this is invalid because E is in 5).
So ""HEAVE"" is invalid.

Next candidate: ""EATEN"" – contains N (ruled out).
""EBBING"" – too long.
""EARLY"" – contains L (ruled out).
""EASED"" – contains S (ruled out).
""EATER"" – contains T and R (ruled out).
""EBONY"" – contains N (ruled out) and Y is questionable.
""ECHELON"" – too long.
""EMCEE"" – contains C twice and E in 2 and 5 (invalid for E in 5).
""EMBED"" – contains D and B, E in 2 and 5 (invalid for E in 5).
""EMCEE"" is invalid for E in 5.

Let's try E in position 1 and A in position 4 or 5:
""E _ _ A _"" or ""E _ _ _ A"".
But E can't be in 5, and A can't be in 1 or 2.

""E _ A _ _"" – A in 3, E in 1 or 2.
""E A _ _ _"" – A in 2 (invalid).

""E _ _ _ A"" – A in 5, E in 1 or 2.
""E _ _ A _"" – A in 4, E in 1 or 2.

Let's try ""EACHY"" – invalid.
""EMBED"" – E in 1, M, B, E in 2 (invalid for E in 2 and 5).
""EBB"" – too short.
""EJECT"" – contains T (ruled out).
""EVOKE"" – contains O (ruled out).
""EVOKE"" invalid.

""EPIPHANY"" – too long.
""EQUIP"" – contains U and I, P, E in 4 (invalid for E in 4).

""EPIPHANY"" invalid.

""EJECT"" invalid.

""EVOKE"" invalid.

""EPIPHANY"" invalid.

""EQUIP"" invalid.

""EPIPHANY"" invalid.

""EPIPHANY"" invalid.

Let me think differently: use remaining letters B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

We need a word with A and E, avoiding positions already ruled out.

Try ""BEACH"" – 5 letters, B, E, A, C, H. A is in 3, E is in 2. This fits:

- A not in 1 or 2 (it's 3).
- E not in 4 or 5 (it's 2).
- Uses only allowed letters (B, E, A, C, H).

""BEACH"" seems valid.

Let me verify:
- B: allowed
- E: allowed (not in 4 or 5, it's 2)
- A: allowed (not in 1 or 2, it's 3)
- C: allowed
- H: allowed
- No R, O, S, T, L, N.

This looks good.

Summary of what we know so far:
- Letters in the word: E (position 2), A, C.
- Letters ruled out: R, O, S, T, L, N, P, H.
- Positions ruled out:
  - A: not 1, 2, 3 (from arose, taLEN, PEACH feedback) → A must be in 4 or 5.
  - C: not 4 → C must be in 1, 3, or 5.

So the word looks like: _ E _ _ _ with A and C somewhere in the remaining slots, avoiding the ruled-out positions.

Possible patterns:
- Position 4 or 5 for A.
- Position 1, 3, or 5 for C.

Let's try to place A and C:
Case 1: A in 4, C in 1 or 3
Case 2: A in 5, C in 1 or 3

Let's consider Case 1: A in 4
- C can be in 1 or 3
  - C E A _ _ (A in 4) → need two more letters from remaining allowed letters (B, D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.)
  - _ E C A _ (A in 4) → same.

Case 2: A in 5
- C can be in 1 or 3
  - C E _ _ A (A in 5) → need two more letters.
  - _ E C _ A (A in 5) → same.

Let's look for common 5-letter words that fit these patterns and use only allowed letters.

Looking at Case 2: _ E C _ A
- Need a letter for position 1 and 4.
- Allowed letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y.
- Trying B: B E C _ A → need a letter for position 4. Let's try M: B E C M A → ""BECMA"" – not a word.
- Trying D: D E C _ A → ""DEC_A"" – need a letter. ""DECAY"" – but Y is allowed, but A is in 5. ""DECAY"" is 5 letters, but A is in 5 (allowed), Y is allowed, but C is in 3 (allowed), E in 2 (correct). This seems valid.
- Check DECAY:
  - D: allowed
  - E: correct position 2
  - C: allowed (position 3, not 4)
  - A: allowed (position 5, not 1,2,3)
  - Y: allowed
  - No ruled-out letters.

""KECCA"" – not a word.
""BECAL"" – L ruled out.

Looking at Case 1: C E A _ _ or _ E C A _
- C E A _ _ – need letters 4 and 5. ""CEA__"" – ""CEASE"" – S ruled out.
- _ E C A _ – need letter 1 and 5. ""E"" is 2, so ""E"" is fixed. ""E"" is 2, so word is _ E C A _. ""ECA_"" – ""ECA__"" – ""ECA"" is start, but need two letters. ""ECA"" plus two letters. ""ECA"" + ""B"" + ""D"" – ""ECABD"" – not a word.

DECAY seems the best fit.

Let me verify DECAY:
- Letters: D, E, C, A, Y
- Ruled-out letters avoided: R, O, S, T, L, N, P, H – all absent.
- Positions:
  - E in 2 (correct)
  - A in 5 (allowed, not 1,2,3)

Another candidate: _ E C _ A – ""FEC_A"" – ""FECAL"" – but L is ruled out.
""MECCA"" – but M is allowed, E in 2, C in 3, C in 4 (but C can't be in 4 from feedback), so invalid.
""KECCA"" – not a word.
""BECAL"" – L ruled out.

Looking at Case 1: C E A _ _ or _ E C A _
- C E A _ _ – need letters 4 and 5. ""CEA__"" – ""CEASE"" – S ruled out.
- _ E C A _ – need letter 1 and 5. ""E"" is 2, so ""E"" is fixed. ""E"" is 2, so word is _ E C A _. ""ECA_"" – ""ECA__"" – ""ECA"" is start, but need two letters. ""ECA"" plus two letters. ""ECA"" + ""B"" + ""D"" – ""ECABD"" – not a word.

DECAY seems the best fit.

Let me verify DECAY:
- Letters: D, E, C, A, Y
- Ruled-out letters avoided: R, O, S, T, L, N, P, H – all absent.
- Positions:
  - E in 2 (correct)
  - A in 5 (allowed, not 1,2,3)
  - C in 3 (allowed, not 4)
  - D and Y in 1 and 4 (allowed)
- This seems valid.",Guess 4: DECAY -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) E(✓) C(✓) A(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
