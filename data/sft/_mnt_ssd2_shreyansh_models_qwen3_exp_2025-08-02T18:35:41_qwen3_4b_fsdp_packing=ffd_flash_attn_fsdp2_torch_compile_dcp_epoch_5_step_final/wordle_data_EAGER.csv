For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should ideally include 2-3 vowels and 3 consonants. 

Some popular strong starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (but this has 4 vowels, which is less optimal)
- AUDIO (but this has 4 vowels)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This should give us good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the correct position (✓) at position 2
- I is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _
- It contains R and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively
- It does NOT contain I or S

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A as the second letter
- R somewhere except position 1
- E somewhere except position 5
- No I or S

Possible candidates:
- BREAD: B(1), R(2), E(3), A(4), D(5) – but A is in position 4, not 2, so no
- CRAVE: C(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), E(5) – A is in position 3, not 2, so no
- FRAME: F(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), E(5) – A is in position 3, not 2, so no
- GRADE: G(1), R(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) – A is in position 3, not 2, so no
- PLACE: P(1), L(2), A(3), C(4), E(5) – A is in position 3, not 2, so no

Let me think differently: A is in position 2, so the word is _ A _ _ _

Looking for words with A in position 2 and containing R and E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively).

Possible words:
- BARER: B(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5) – A is in position 2, R is in positions 3 and 5 (not 1), E is in position 4 (not 5) – this fits
- DRAIN: D(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), N(5) – but I is not allowed
- TREAD: T(1), R(2), E(3), A(4), D(5) – A is in position 4, not 2, so no
- BRAKE: B(1), R(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) – A is in position 3, not 2, so no
- GRATE: G(1), R(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) – A is in position 3, not 2, so no

BARER seems to fit all constraints:

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: RAISE  
R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)  
→ A is fixed in position 2.  
→ R and E are in the word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.  
→ I and S are not in the word.

Round 2: CARED  
C(x) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)  
→ A is still correct in position 2.  
→ E is now correct in position 4.  
→ R is in the word but not in position 3.  
→ C and D are not in the word.

So the pattern so far is: _ A _ E  
Letters we know are present: R, A, E  
Letters known absent: C, D, I, S  
R cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from RAISE and CARED feedback).  
Therefore R must be in position 5.

Thus the word must be: _ A _ E R  
Only position 1 and 3 remain to be filled.

Looking for common consonants that fit:
- Position 1: common starting consonants (B, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, etc.)  
- Position 3: must be a consonant (since A and E are already used)

Possible candidates:
- B A R E R → BARER (but R is already in position 5, so duplicate R is allowed)  
- F A R E R → FARE R (invalid, not a word)  
- G A R E R → GARE R (invalid)  
- H A R E R → HARE R (invalid)  
- L A R E R → LARE R (invalid)  
- M A R E R → MARE R (invalid)  
- N A R E R → NARE R (invalid)  
- P A R E R → PARE R (invalid)  
- T A R E R → TARE R (invalid)

Wait, BARER is a valid word (past tense of bar).  
Let me check BARER: B(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5)  
But from feedback R cannot be in position 3 (from CARED feedback).  
So BARER is invalid because R is in position 3.

Hmm, need to re-examine:  
Pattern is _ A _ E R  
R is in position 5 (only remaining spot).

Let's try TALER.

TALER: T(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), R(5)  
- A is in position 2 ✓  
- E is in position 4 ✓  
- R is in position 5 (not 1 or 3) ✓  
- No C, D, I, S ✓  
- All letters are new except A and E which are already confirmed.

This seems optimal.

Round 1: RAISE  
R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)  
→ A is fixed in position 2.  
→ R and E are in the word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.  
→ I and S are not in the word.

Round 2: CARED  
C(x) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)  
→ A is still correct in position 2.  
→ E is now correct in position 4.  
→ R is in the word but not in position 3.  
→ C and D are not in the word.

So the pattern so far is: _ A _ E  
Letters we know are present: R, A, E  
Letters known absent: C, D, I, S  
R cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from RAISE and CARED feedback).  
Therefore R must be in position 5.

Thus the word must be: _ A _ E R  
Only position 1 and 3 remain to be filled.

Looking for common consonants that fit:
- Position 1: common starting consonants (B, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, etc.)  
- Position 3: must be a consonant (since A and E are already used)

Possible candidates:
- B A R E R → BARER (but R is already in position 5, so duplicate R is allowed)  
- F A R E R → FARE R (invalid, not a word)  
- G A R E R → GARE R (invalid)

- N A R E R → NARE R (invalid)  
- P A R E R → PARE R (invalid)  
- T A R E R → TARE R (invalid)

Wait, BARER is a valid word (past tense of bar).  
Let me check BARER: B(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5)  
But from feedback R cannot be in position 3 (from CARED feedback).  
So BARER is invalid because R is in position 3.

Hmm, need to re-examine:  
Pattern is _ A _ E R  
R is in position 5 (only remaining spot).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should ideally include 2-3 vowels and 3 consonants. 

Some popular strong starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (but this has 4 vowels, which is less optimal)
- AUDIO (but this has 4 vowels)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This should give us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the correct position (✓) at position 2
- I is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _
- It contains R and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively
- It does NOT contain I or S

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A as the second letter
- R somewhere except position 1
- E somewhere except position 5
- No I or S

Possible candidates:
- BREAD: B(1), R(2), E(3), A(4), D(5) – but A is in position 4, not 2, so no
- CRAVE: C(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), E(5) – A is in position 3, not 2, so no
- FRAME: F(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), E(5) – A is in position 3, not 2, so no
- GRADE: G(1), R(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) – A is in position 3, not 2, so no
- PLACE: P(1), L(2), A(3), C(4), E(5) – A is in position 3, not 2, so no

Let me think differently: A is in position 2, so the word is _ A _ _ _

Looking for words with A in position 2 and containing R and E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively).

Possible words:
- BARER: B(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5) – A is in position 2, R is in positions 3 and 5 (not 1), E is in position 4 (not 5) – this fits
- DRAIN: D(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), N(5) – but I is not allowed
- TREAD: T(1), R(2), E(3), A(4), D(5) – A is in position 4, not 2, so no
- BRAKE: B(1), R(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) – A is in position 3, not 2, so no
- GRATE: G(1), R(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) – A is in position 3, not 2, so no

BARER seems to fit all constraints:
- A is in position 2
- Contains R (positions 3 and 5, not 1)
- Contains E (position 4, not 5)
- No I or S

Let me check if there are better options:
- CARED: C(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), D(5) – A is in position 2, R is in position 3 (not 1), E is in position 4 (not 5) – this also fits
- CARED is a valid word and seems slightly better

Between BARER and CARED, CARED has more common letters (C, R, E, D) and A is in position 2. I'll go with CARED.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should ideally include 2-3 vowels and 3 consonants. 

Some popular strong starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (but this has 4 vowels, which is less optimal)
- AUDIO (but this has 4 vowels)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This should give us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the correct position (✓) at position 2
- I is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _
- It contains R and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively
- It does NOT contain I or S

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A as the second letter
- R somewhere except position 1
- E somewhere except position 5
- No I or S

Possible candidates:
- BREAD: B(1), R(2), E(3), A(4), D(5) – but A is in position 4, not 2, so no
- CRAVE: C(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), E(5) – A is in position 3, not 2, so no
- FRAME: F(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), E(5) – A is in position 3, not 2, so no
- GRADE: G(1), R(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) – A is in position 3, not 2, so no
- PLACE: P(1), L(2), A(3), C(4), E(5) – A is in position 3, not 2, so no

Let me think differently: A is in position 2, so the word is _ A _ _ _

Looking for words with A in position 2 and containing R and E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively).

Possible words:
- BARER: B(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5) – A is in position 2, R is in positions 3 and 5 (not 1), E is in position 4 (not 5) – this fits
- DRAIN: D(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), N(5) – but I is not allowed
- TREAD: T(1), R(2), E(3), A(4), D(5) – A is in position 4, not 2, so no
- BRAKE: B(1), R(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) – A is in position 3, not 2, so no
- GRATE: G(1), R(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) – A is in position 3, not 2, so no

BARER seems to fit all constraints:
- A is in position 2
- Contains R (positions 3 and 5, not 1)
- Contains E (position 4, not 5)
- No I or S

Let me check if there are better options:
- CARED: C(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), D(5) – A is in position 2, R is in position 3 (not 1), E is in position 4 (not 5) – this also fits
- CARED is a valid word and seems slightly better

Between BARER and CARED, CARED has more common letters (C, R, E, D) and A is in position 2. I'll go with CARED.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: CARED -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: RAISE  
R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)  
→ A is fixed in position 2.  
→ R and E are in the word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.  
→ I and S are not in the word.

Round 2: CARED  
C(x) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)  
→ A is still correct in position 2.  
→ E is now correct in position 4.  
→ R is in the word but not in position 3.  
→ C and D are not in the word.

So the pattern so far is: _ A _ E  
Letters we know are present: R, A, E  
Letters known absent: C, D, I, S  
R cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from RAISE and CARED feedback).  
Therefore R must be in position 5.

Thus the word must be: _ A _ E R  
Only position 1 and 3 remain to be filled.

Looking for common consonants that fit:
- Position 1: common starting consonants (B, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, etc.)  
- Position 3: must be a consonant (since A and E are already used)

Possible candidates:
- B A R E R → BARER (but R is already in position 5, so duplicate R is allowed)  
- F A R E R → FARE R (invalid, not a word)  
- G A R E R → GARE R (invalid)  
- H A R E R → HARE R (invalid)  
- L A R E R → LARE R (invalid)  
- M A R E R → MARE R (invalid)  
- N A R E R → NARE R (invalid)  
- P A R E R → PARE R (invalid)  
- T A R E R → TARE R (invalid)

Wait, BARER is a valid word (past tense of bar).  
Let me check BARER: B(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5)  
But from feedback R cannot be in position 3 (from CARED feedback).  
So BARER is invalid because R is in position 3.

Hmm, need to re-examine:  
Pattern is _ A _ E R  
R is in position 5 (only remaining spot).  
So positions 1 and 3 need consonants.

Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting _ A _ E R:
- B A L E R → BALER (valid)  
- F A L E R → FALER (invalid)  
- G A L E R → GALER (invalid)  
- H A L E R → HALER (valid)  
- L A R E R → already invalid  
- M A R E R → invalid  
- N A R E R → invalid  
- P A L E R → PALER (valid)  
- T A L E R → TALER (valid)  

Valid candidates: BALER, HALER, PALER, TALER  
Among these, TALER is the most common word (a currency unit).  
Let's try TALER.

TALER: T(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), R(5)  
- A is in position 2 ✓  
- E is in position 4 ✓  
- R is in position 5 (not 1 or 3) ✓  
- No C, D, I, S ✓  
- All letters are new except A and E which are already confirmed.

This seems optimal.

From the three rounds:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is fixed in position 2
   - R and E are in the word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively
   - I and S are not in the word

2. CARED → C(x) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)
   - A is still correct in position 2
   - E is now correct in position 4
   - R is in the word but not in position 3
   - C and D are not in the word

3. TALER → T(x) A(✓) L(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - A is correct in position 2
   - E is correct in position 4
   - R is now correct in position 5
   - T and L are not in the word

So the pattern is: _ A _ E R
Letters known to be absent: C, D, I, S, T, L

We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters not yet ruled out.
Common consonants left: B, F, G, H, M, N, P, etc.

Possible words:
- B A R E R → BARER (R in position 3 is invalid, ruled out)
- F A R E R → invalid
- G A R E R → invalid
- H A R E R → invalid
- M A R E R → invalid
- N A R E R → invalid
- P A R E R → invalid
- B A N E R → BANER (not a common word)
- F A N E R → FANER (not a word)
- G A N E R → GANER (not a word)
- H A N E R → HANER (not a word)
- M A N E R → MANER (not a word)
- N A M E R → NAMER (not a word)

- H A P E R → HAPER (not a word)
- P A H E R → PAHER (not a word)
- M A P E R → MAPER (not a word)
- B A M E R → BAMER (not a word)

Valid common words left:
- HAMER (a surname, but valid)
- BANER (rare)
- NAMER (rare)

Among these, HAMER is the most common.

Let's check HAMER:
H(1), A(2), M(3), E(4), R(5)
- A in position 2 ✓
- E in position 4 ✓
- R in position 5 ✓
- H and M are new and not ruled out
- No forbidden letters

This fits perfectly.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should ideally include 2-3 vowels and 3 consonants. 

Some popular strong starting words are:
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (but this has 4 vowels, which is less optimal)
- AUDIO (but this has 4 vowels)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, I, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)
This should give us good coverage of common letters and positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- A is in the correct position (✓) at position 2
- I is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word has the pattern _ A _ _ _
- It contains R and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively
- It does NOT contain I or S

We need a 5-letter word with:
- A as the second letter
- R somewhere except position 1
- E somewhere except position 5
- No I or S

Possible candidates:
- BREAD: B(1), R(2), E(3), A(4), D(5) – but A is in position 4, not 2, so no
- CRAVE: C(1), R(2), A(3), V(4), E(5) – A is in position 3, not 2, so no
- FRAME: F(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), E(5) – A is in position 3, not 2, so no
- GRADE: G(1), R(2), A(3), D(4), E(5) – A is in position 3, not 2, so no
- PLACE: P(1), L(2), A(3), C(4), E(5) – A is in position 3, not 2, so no

Let me think differently: A is in position 2, so the word is _ A _ _ _

Looking for words with A in position 2 and containing R and E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively).

Possible words:
- BARER: B(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5) – A is in position 2, R is in positions 3 and 5 (not 1), E is in position 4 (not 5) – this fits
- DRAIN: D(1), R(2), A(3), I(4), N(5) – but I is not allowed
- TREAD: T(1), R(2), E(3), A(4), D(5) – A is in position 4, not 2, so no
- BRAKE: B(1), R(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) – A is in position 3, not 2, so no
- GRATE: G(1), R(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) – A is in position 3, not 2, so no

BARER seems to fit all constraints:
- A is in position 2
- Contains R (positions 3 and 5, not 1)
- Contains E (position 4, not 5)
- No I or S

Let me check if there are better options:
- CARED: C(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), D(5) – A is in position 2, R is in position 3 (not 1), E is in position 4 (not 5) – this also fits
- CARED is a valid word and seems slightly better

Between BARER and CARED, CARED has more common letters (C, R, E, D) and A is in position 2. I'll go with CARED.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: CARED -> FEEDBACK: C(x) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: RAISE  
R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)  
→ A is fixed in position 2.  
→ R and E are in the word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.  
→ I and S are not in the word.

Round 2: CARED  
C(x) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)  
→ A is still correct in position 2.  
→ E is now correct in position 4.  
→ R is in the word but not in position 3.  
→ C and D are not in the word.

So the pattern so far is: _ A _ E  
Letters we know are present: R, A, E  
Letters known absent: C, D, I, S  
R cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (from RAISE and CARED feedback).  
Therefore R must be in position 5.

Thus the word must be: _ A _ E R  
Only position 1 and 3 remain to be filled.

Looking for common consonants that fit:
- Position 1: common starting consonants (B, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, etc.)  
- Position 3: must be a consonant (since A and E are already used)

Possible candidates:
- B A R E R → BARER (but R is already in position 5, so duplicate R is allowed)  
- F A R E R → FARE R (invalid, not a word)  
- G A R E R → GARE R (invalid)  
- H A R E R → HARE R (invalid)  
- L A R E R → LARE R (invalid)  
- M A R E R → MARE R (invalid)  
- N A R E R → NARE R (invalid)  
- P A R E R → PARE R (invalid)  
- T A R E R → TARE R (invalid)

Wait, BARER is a valid word (past tense of bar).  
Let me check BARER: B(1), A(2), R(3), E(4), R(5)  
But from feedback R cannot be in position 3 (from CARED feedback).  
So BARER is invalid because R is in position 3.

Hmm, need to re-examine:  
Pattern is _ A _ E R  
R is in position 5 (only remaining spot).  
So positions 1 and 3 need consonants.

Looking for valid 5-letter words fitting _ A _ E R:
- B A L E R → BALER (valid)  
- F A L E R → FALER (invalid)  
- G A L E R → GALER (invalid)  
- H A L E R → HALER (valid)  
- L A R E R → already invalid  
- M A R E R → invalid  
- N A R E R → invalid  
- P A L E R → PALER (valid)  
- T A L E R → TALER (valid)  

Valid candidates: BALER, HALER, PALER, TALER  
Among these, TALER is the most common word (a currency unit).  
Let's try TALER.

TALER: T(1), A(2), L(3), E(4), R(5)  
- A is in position 2 ✓  
- E is in position 4 ✓  
- R is in position 5 (not 1 or 3) ✓  
- No C, D, I, S ✓  
- All letters are new except A and E which are already confirmed.

This seems optimal.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds:

1. RAISE → R(-) A(✓) I(x) S(x) E(-)
   - A is fixed in position 2
   - R and E are in the word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively
   - I and S are not in the word

2. CARED → C(x) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)
   - A is still correct in position 2
   - E is now correct in position 4
   - R is in the word but not in position 3
   - C and D are not in the word

3. TALER → T(x) A(✓) L(x) E(✓) R(✓)
   - A is correct in position 2
   - E is correct in position 4
   - R is now correct in position 5
   - T and L are not in the word

So the pattern is: _ A _ E R
Letters known to be absent: C, D, I, S, T, L

We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with letters not yet ruled out.
Common consonants left: B, F, G, H, M, N, P, etc.

Possible words:
- B A R E R → BARER (R in position 3 is invalid, ruled out)
- F A R E R → invalid
- G A R E R → invalid
- H A R E R → invalid
- M A R E R → invalid
- N A R E R → invalid
- P A R E R → invalid
- B A N E R → BANER (not a common word)
- F A N E R → FANER (not a word)
- G A N E R → GANER (not a word)
- H A N E R → HANER (not a word)
- M A N E R → MANER (not a word)
- N A M E R → NAMER (not a word)

- H A P E R → HAPER (not a word)
- P A H E R → PAHER (not a word)
- M A P E R → MAPER (not a word)
- B A M E R → BAMER (not a word)

Valid common words left:
- HAMER (a surname, but valid)
- BANER (rare)
- NAMER (rare)

Among these, HAMER is the most common.

Let's check HAMER:
H(1), A(2), M(3), E(4), R(5)
- A in position 2 ✓
- E in position 4 ✓
- R in position 5 ✓
- H and M are new and not ruled out
- No forbidden letters

This fits perfectly.

Positions ruled out for A and E: already satisfied

Remaining consonants for positions 1 and 3 (not yet used and not ruled out):
B, F, G, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
