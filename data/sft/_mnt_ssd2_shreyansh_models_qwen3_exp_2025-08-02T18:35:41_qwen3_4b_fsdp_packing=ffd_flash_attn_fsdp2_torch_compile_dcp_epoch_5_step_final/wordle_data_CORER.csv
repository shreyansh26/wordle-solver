For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeating letters. This gives us the best chance to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – not in the word at all
- R (-) – in the word but wrong position (was 2nd, so it must be 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th)
- O (-) – in the word but wrong position (was 3rd, so it must be 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th)
- S (x) – not in the word at all
- E (-) – in the word but wrong position (was 5th, so it must be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th)

So the secret word:
- Contains R, O, E (each in some position other than their original ones)
- Does NOT contain A or S
- Letters left to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a word that uses R, O, E in different positions and adds two new letters. Let’s try “TROPE”:
- T is new, P is new
- R is now in 2nd position (originally 2nd, so this would be same position – but feedback said R was in wrong position, so 2nd is invalid for R)
So TROPE is invalid for R.

Next try “ROOTE” – but has O twice, and E in same position (invalid per feedback).

Try “CREPE”:
- C, P new
- R in 2nd (invalid for R)

Try “PROBE”:
- P, B new
- R in 2nd (invalid)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeating letters. This gives us the best chance to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – not in the word at all
- R (-) – in the word but wrong position (was 2nd, so it must be 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th)
- O (-) – in the word but wrong position (was 3rd, so it must be 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th)
- S (x) – not in the word at all
- E (-) – in the word but wrong position (was 5th, so it must be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th)

So the secret word:
- Contains R, O, E (each in some position other than their original ones)
- Does NOT contain A or S
- Letters left to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a word that uses R, O, E in different positions and adds two new letters. Let’s try “TROPE”:
- T is new, P is new
- R is now in 2nd position (originally 2nd, so this would be same position – but feedback said R was in wrong position, so 2nd is invalid for R)
So TROPE is invalid for R.

Next try “ROOTE” – but has O twice, and E in same position (invalid per feedback).

Try “CREPE”:
- C, P new
- R in 2nd (invalid for R)

Try “PROBE”:
- P, B new
- R in 2nd (invalid)

Try “TOWER”:
- T, W new
- E in 4th (valid, since E was 5th)
- O in 2nd (valid, since O was 3rd)
- R in 5th (valid, since R was 2nd)
- No A or S

TOWER satisfies all constraints.

For the first guess, it's best to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct letters to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most frequent letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeating letters. This gives us the best chance to identify which letters are in the word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A (x) – not in the word at all
- R (-) – in the word but wrong position (was 2nd, so it must be 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th)
- O (-) – in the word but wrong position (was 3rd, so it must be 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th)
- S (x) – not in the word at all
- E (-) – in the word but wrong position (was 5th, so it must be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th)

So the secret word:
- Contains R, O, E (each in some position other than their original ones)
- Does NOT contain A or S
- Letters left to consider: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a word that uses R, O, E in different positions and adds two new letters. Let’s try “TROPE”:
- T is new, P is new
- R is now in 2nd position (originally 2nd, so this would be same position – but feedback said R was in wrong position, so 2nd is invalid for R)
So TROPE is invalid for R.

Next try “ROOTE” – but has O twice, and E in same position (invalid per feedback).

Try “CREPE”:
- C, P new
- R in 2nd (invalid for R)

Try “PROBE”:
- P, B new
- R in 2nd (invalid)

Try “TOWER”:
- T, W new
- E in 4th (valid, since E was 5th)
- O in 2nd (valid, since O was 3rd)
- R in 5th (valid, since R was 2nd)
- No A or S

TOWER satisfies all constraints.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: TOWER -> FEEDBACK: T(x) O(✓) W(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on TOWER:

- T (x) – not in the word  
- O (✓) – correct in position 2  
- W (x) – not in the word  
- E (✓) – correct in position 4  
- R (✓) – correct in position 5  

So the secret word looks like: _ O _ E R

Known letters: O (2), E (4), R (5)  
Forbidden letters so far: A, S, T, W  
Remaining letters to test: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z  

We need two new letters for positions 1 and 3.  
Good candidates for position 1: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, P  
Good candidates for position 3: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z  

Try common consonants first. Let’s try “B” in position 1 and “O” already fixed, so position 3 needs a new consonant.  
“B” + “O” + “N” + “E” + “R” → BONER.  
Check constraints:  
- B (new) – ok  
- O (2) – matches ✓  
- N (new) – ok  
- E (4) – matches ✓  
- R (5) – matches ✓  

No forbidden letters used. BONER is a valid 5-letter word.

Current known pattern: _ O _ E R  
Confirmed letters: O (2), E (4), R (5)  
Forbidden letters so far: A, S, T, W, B, N  
Remaining letters to test: C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z  

We need two new letters for positions 1 and 3.  
Position 1: common consonants left: C, D, F, G, H, L, M, P  
Position 3: common consonants left: C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, plus vowels I, U  

Let’s try common combinations.  
- C + O + D + E + R → CODER (but D is new and allowed)  
- C + O + K + E + R → COKER (but K is less common)  
- C + O + M + E + R → COMER (M is allowed)  
- D + O + L + E + R → DOGER (but G is allowed)  
- H + O + L + E + R → HOGER (but G is allowed)  
- P + O + L + E + R → POGER (but G is allowed)  

CODER uses C and D, both new letters. It’s a common word and fits the pattern. Let’s try CODER.
