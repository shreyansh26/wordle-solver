For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should cover as many of these as possible. 

""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - covering 5 of the most common letters. This gives a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(x) → A is not in the word at all.  
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- O(x) → O is not in the word.  
- S(x) → S is not in the word.  
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains R and E.  
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S.  
- R is not in position 2; E is not in position 5.

To maximize information, I want a word that:
1. Uses R and E (since we know they are in the word).  
2. Avoids A, O, S.  
3. Places R and E in new positions to test their correct spots.  
4. Introduces new common consonants and vowels that haven’t been tested yet (like T, N, L, I, C, etc.).

A good candidate is “TREND”:
- T (new consonant)  
- R (known in word, now in position 2)  
- E (known in word, now in position 3)  
- N (new consonant)  
- D (new consonant)

This tests R and E in new positions while adding three fresh letters (T, N, D) that are common in English words.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, D  
Letters that ARE in the word: R, E, N  
Positions we have ruled out so far:
- R is NOT in position 2 (from arose) and NOT in position 2 (from trend)  
- E is NOT in position 5 (from arose) and NOT in position 3 (from trend)  
- N is NOT in position 4 (from trend)

So the secret word:
- Must contain the letters R, E, N exactly once each.  
- May NOT contain A, O, S, T, D.  
- R cannot be in position 2.  
- E cannot be in position 3 or 5.  
- N cannot be in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that uses only letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding A, O, S, T, D) and respects the positional constraints.

Remaining common letters we can still use: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, plus the required R, E, N.

Let’s try to place R, E, N in allowed positions and fill the rest with new letters.

One promising pattern: place R in position 1 or 3, E in 1, 2, or 4, N in 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4).

Let’s try:
R _ _ _ E  → but E cannot be in position 5, so this is fine, but we still need to place N somewhere.

How about: R N E _ _  → but N cannot be in position 2 (from trend feedback), so this is invalid.

Another pattern: _ R _ E _  → R in position 2 is invalid (from arose).

Next: _ _ R E _  → R in position 3 is allowed, E in position 4 is allowed.

Let’s try _ _ R E _  and fill the blanks with new letters.

Possible letters left: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s pick common consonants: C and H.

Word: B C R E H → but this is not a valid English word.

Try: C H R E W → not valid.

Try: P R E N _  → but R cannot be in position 2.

Try: F R E N _  → but R cannot be in position 2.

Try: _ E R N _  → E in position 2, R in position 3, N in position 4 → but N cannot be in position 4.

Try: _ E R _ N  → E in position 2, R in position 3, N in position 5 → but E cannot be in position 5 (already ruled out), and N in position 5 is allowed.

So: _ E R _ N  → need a letter in position 1 and 4.

Position 1: must be from remaining letters (B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y).

Position 4: same.

Let’s try C and H: C E R H N → not a valid word.

Try P E R L N → not valid.

Try G E R M N → not valid.

Try B E R N _  → B E R N _  → B E R N _  → but we need 5 letters.

Wait, let’s think differently: we know the word must contain R, E, N and no A, O, S, T, D.

Let’s list possible 5-letter words with R, E, N and allowed letters.

Some possibilities:
- B E R N _  → need a 5th letter, but BERN_ doesn’t make a word.
- C H E R N  → C H E R N → this is a valid word (chern is a variant spelling of ""churn"", but might be obscure).
- F R E N _  → but R cannot be in position 2.
- P R E N _  → R cannot be in position 2.
- G R E N _  → R cannot be in position 2.
- B R E N _  → R cannot be in position 2.
- C R E N _  → R cannot be in position 2.
- F R E N _  → same issue.

Try: _ N E R _  → N in position 1, E in position 3, R in position 4, but E cannot be in position 3 (from trend feedback).

Try: N E R _ _  → N in position 1, E in position 2, R in position 3, but then we need two more letters.

Word: N E R V Y  → but we haven’t tested V or Y yet, and this uses N, E, R in allowed positions.

Check constraints:
- N is in position 1: allowed (only position 4 was ruled out for N).
- E is in position 2: allowed (only positions 3 and 5 were ruled out for E).
- R is in position 3: allowed (only position 2 was ruled out for R).

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should cover as many of these as possible. 

""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - covering 5 of the most common letters. This gives a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(x) → A is not in the word at all.  
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- O(x) → O is not in the word.  
- S(x) → S is not in the word.  
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains R and E.  
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S.  
- R is not in position 2; E is not in position 5.

To maximize information, I want a word that:
1. Uses R and E (since we know they are in the word).  
2. Avoids A, O, S.  
3. Places R and E in new positions to test their correct spots.  
4. Introduces new common consonants and vowels that haven’t been tested yet (like T, N, L, I, C, etc.).

A good candidate is “TREND”:
- T (new consonant)  
- R (known in word, now in position 2)  
- E (known in word, now in position 3)  
- N (new consonant)  
- D (new consonant)

This tests R and E in new positions while adding three fresh letters (T, N, D) that are common in English words.

Guess 2: trend -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) E(-) N(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, D  
Letters that ARE in the word: R, E, N  
Positions we have ruled out so far:
- R is NOT in position 2 (from arose) and NOT in position 2 (from trend)  
- E is NOT in position 5 (from arose) and NOT in position 3 (from trend)  
- N is NOT in position 4 (from trend)

So the secret word:
- Must contain the letters R, E, N exactly once each.  
- May NOT contain A, O, S, T, D.  
- R cannot be in position 2.  
- E cannot be in position 3 or 5.  
- N cannot be in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that uses only letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding A, O, S, T, D) and respects the positional constraints.

Remaining common letters we can still use: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, plus the required R, E, N.

Let’s try to place R, E, N in allowed positions and fill the rest with new letters.

One promising pattern: place R in position 1 or 3, E in 1, 2, or 4, N in 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4).

Let’s try:
R _ _ _ E  → but E cannot be in position 5, so this is fine, but we still need to place N somewhere.

How about: R N E _ _  → but N cannot be in position 2 (from trend feedback), so this is invalid.

Another pattern: _ R _ E _  → R in position 2 is invalid (from arose).

Next: _ _ R E _  → R in position 3 is allowed, E in position 4 is allowed.

Let’s try _ _ R E _  and fill the blanks with new letters.

Possible letters left: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s pick common consonants: C and H.

Word: B C R E H → but this is not a valid English word.

Try: C H R E W → not valid.

Try: P R E N _  → but R cannot be in position 2.

Try: F R E N _  → but R cannot be in position 2.

Try: _ E R N _  → E in position 2, R in position 3, N in position 4 → but N cannot be in position 4.

Try: _ E R _ N  → E in position 2, R in position 3, N in position 5 → but E cannot be in position 5 (already ruled out), and N in position 5 is allowed.

So: _ E R _ N  → need a letter in position 1 and 4.

Position 1: must be from remaining letters (B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y).

Position 4: same.

Let’s try C and H: C E R H N → not a valid word.

Try P E R L N → not valid.

Try G E R M N → not valid.

Try B E R N _  → B E R N _  → B E R N _  → but we need 5 letters.

Wait, let’s think differently: we know the word must contain R, E, N and no A, O, S, T, D.

Let’s list possible 5-letter words with R, E, N and allowed letters.

Some possibilities:
- B E R N _  → need a 5th letter, but BERN_ doesn’t make a word.
- C H E R N  → C H E R N → this is a valid word (chern is a variant spelling of ""churn"", but might be obscure).
- F R E N _  → but R cannot be in position 2.
- P R E N _  → R cannot be in position 2.
- G R E N _  → R cannot be in position 2.
- B R E N _  → R cannot be in position 2.
- C R E N _  → R cannot be in position 2.
- F R E N _  → same issue.

Try: _ N E R _  → N in position 1, E in position 3, R in position 4, but E cannot be in position 3 (from trend feedback).

Try: N E R _ _  → N in position 1, E in position 2, R in position 3, but then we need two more letters.

Word: N E R V Y  → but we haven’t tested V or Y yet, and this uses N, E, R in allowed positions.

Check constraints:
- N is in position 1: allowed (only position 4 was ruled out for N).
- E is in position 2: allowed (only positions 3 and 5 were ruled out for E).
- R is in position 3: allowed (only position 2 was ruled out for R).
- V and Y are new letters not yet tested.

""NERVY"" is a valid English word (meaning ""restless or agitated"").

Let’s go with NERVY.

From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4 (from arose, trend, nervy)  
- N is in the word but NOT in positions 4, 5 (from trend, nervy)

So the secret word:

- Must contain R and N exactly once each.
- R cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4 → the only remaining spot for R is position 5.
- N cannot be in positions 4, 5 → the only remaining spot for N is position 1 or 3.
- Allowed letters so far: R, E, N plus any letters not yet ruled out (B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, W, etc.).

Current skeleton:
- Position 1: must be N or another allowed letter.
- Position 2: E (fixed).
- Position 3: must be N or another allowed letter.
- Position 4: must be another allowed letter.
- Position 5: R (forced).

But N cannot be in positions 4 or 5, and position 5 is already R, so N must be in position 1 or 3.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should cover as many of these as possible. 

""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - covering 5 of the most common letters. This gives a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(x) → A is not in the word at all.  
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- O(x) → O is not in the word.  
- S(x) → S is not in the word.  
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains R and E.  
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S.  
- R is not in position 2; E is not in position 5.

To maximize information, I want a word that:
1. Uses R and E (since we know they are in the word).  
2. Avoids A, O, S.  
3. Places R and E in new positions to test their correct spots.  
4. Introduces new common consonants and vowels that haven’t been tested yet (like T, N, L, I, C, etc.).

A good candidate is “TREND”:
- T (new consonant)  
- R (known in word, now in position 2)  
- E (known in word, now in position 3)

This tests R and E in new positions while adding three fresh letters (T, N, D) that are common in English words.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, D  
Letters that ARE in the word: R, E, N  
Positions we have ruled out so far:
- R is NOT in position 2 (from arose) and NOT in position 2 (from trend)  
- E is NOT in position 5 (from arose) and NOT in position 3 (from trend)  
- N is NOT in position 4 (from trend)

So the secret word:
- Must contain the letters R, E, N exactly once each.  
- May NOT contain A, O, S, T, D.  
- R cannot be in position 2.  
- E cannot be in position 3 or 5.  
- N cannot be in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that uses only letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding A, O, S, T, D) and respects the positional constraints.

Remaining common letters we can still use: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, plus the required R, E, N.

Let’s try to place R, E, N in allowed positions and fill the rest with new letters.

One promising pattern: place R in position 1 or 3, E in 1, 2, or 4, N in 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4).

Let’s try:
R _ _ _ E  → but E cannot be in position 5, so this is fine, but we still need to place N somewhere.

How about: R N E _ _  → but N cannot be in position 2 (from trend feedback), so this is invalid.

Another pattern: _ R _ E _  → R in position 2 is invalid (from arose).

Next: _ _ R E _  → R in position 3 is allowed, E in position 4 is allowed.

Let’s try _ _ R E _  and fill the blanks with new letters.

Possible letters left: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s pick common consonants: C and H.

Word: B C R E H → but this is not a valid English word.

Try: C H R E W → not valid.

Try: P R E N _  → but R cannot be in position 2.

Try: F R E N _  → but R cannot be in position 2.

Try: _ E R N _  → E in position 2, R in position 3, N in position 4 → but N cannot be in position 4.

Try: _ E R _ N  → E in position 2, R in position 3, N in position 5 → but E cannot be in position 5 (already ruled out), and N in position 5 is allowed.

So: _ E R _ N  → need a letter in position 1 and 4.

Position 1: must be from remaining letters (B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y).

Position 4: same.

Let’s try C and H: C E R H N → not a valid word.

Try P E R L N → not valid.

Try G E R M N → not valid.

Try B E R N _  → B E R N _  → B E R N _  → but we need 5 letters.

Wait, let’s think differently: we know the word must contain R, E, N and no A, O, S, T, D.

Let’s list possible 5-letter words with R, E, N and allowed letters.

Some possibilities:
- B E R N _  → need a 5th letter, but BERN_ doesn’t make a word.
- C H E R N  → C H E R N → this is a valid word (chern is a variant spelling of ""churn"", but might be obscure).
- F R E N _  → but R cannot be in position 2.
- P R E N _  → R cannot be in position 2.
- G R E N _  → R cannot be in position 2.
- B R E N _  → R cannot be in position 2.
- C R E N _  → R cannot be in position 2.
- F R E N _  → same issue.

Try: _ N E R _  → N in position 1, E in position 3, R in position 4, but E cannot be in position 3 (from trend feedback).

Try: N E R _ _  → N in position 1, E in position 2, R in position 3, but then we need two more letters.

Word: N E R V Y  → but we haven’t tested V or Y yet, and this uses N, E, R in allowed positions.

Check constraints:
- N is in position 1: allowed (only position 4 was ruled out for N).
- E is in position 2: allowed (only positions 3 and 5 were ruled out for E).
- R is in position 3: allowed (only position 2 was ruled out for R).
- V and Y are new letters not yet tested.

""NERVY"" is a valid English word (meaning ""restless or agitated"").

Let’s go with NERVY.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: trend -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) E(-) N(-) D(x)
Guess 3: nervy -> FEEDBACK: N(-) E(✓) R(-) V(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, D, V, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word: R, E, N  
Exact positions we have:

- E is in position 2 (from guess 3: E(✓))  
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4 (from arose, trend, nervy)  
- N is in the word but NOT in positions 4, 5 (from trend, nervy)

So the secret word:
- Has E in position 2.
- Must contain R and N exactly once each.
- R cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4 → the only remaining spot for R is position 5.
- N cannot be in positions 4, 5 → the only remaining spot for N is position 1 or 3.
- Allowed letters so far: R, E, N plus any letters not yet ruled out (B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, W, etc.).

Current skeleton:
- Position 1: must be N or another allowed letter.
- Position 2: E (fixed).
- Position 3: must be N or another allowed letter.
- Position 4: must be another allowed letter.
- Position 5: R (forced).

But N cannot be in positions 4 or 5, and position 5 is already R, so N must be in position 1 or 3.

Case 1: N in position 1 → N E _ _ R
Case 2: N in position 3 → _ E N _ R

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits one of these patterns using only allowed letters.

Case 1: N E _ _ R
Possible letters for positions 3 and 4: any not yet ruled out (B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, W).
Looking for common words:
- N E B U R → ""nebur"" (not a word)
- N E C K R → ""necker"" (not standard)
- N E P R → too short
- N E C K R → no
- N E W R → no

Case 2: _ E N _ R
Looking for words like:
- B E N _ R → ""benar"" (no)
- C E N _ R → ""cenar"" (no)
- F E N _ R → ""fenar"" (no)
- G E N _ R → ""genar"" (no)
- H E N _ R → ""henar"" (no)
- K E N _ R → ""kenar"" (no)
- L E N _ R → ""lenar"" (no)
- M E N _ R → ""menar"" (no)
- P E N _ R → ""penar"" (no)
- U E N _ R → ""uenar"" (no)
- W E N _ R → ""wenar"" (no)

Wait, let's think of actual valid words:
- ""BENCH"" is 5 letters but ends with CH, not R.
- ""FENCE"" is 5 letters but ends with CE, not R.
- ""GENRE"" is 5 letters: G E N R E → but we need R in position 5, and E in position 2, so this would be G E N E R → ""gender"" (but has D which is ruled out).
- ""MENOR"" is not a word.
- ""PERON"" is a word (short for ""peronospora"" or ""peron""), but P is allowed, E is in position 2, R is in position 5, N is in position 3.

Check ""PERON"":
- P E R O N → but O is ruled out.
- ""PERON"" uses O which is invalid.

Next: ""CENRE"" is not a word.
""FENRE"" is not a word.
""GONER"" is 5 letters: G O N E R → but O is ruled out.
""HENRE"" is not a word.
""LINER"" is a valid word:
- L I N E R → but I is allowed, N is in position 3, E is in position 2, R is in position 5. This fits all constraints:
  - Contains R, E, N.
  - R is in position 5 (allowed).
  - E is in position 2 (matches feedback).
  - N is in position 3 (allowed).
  - Letters used: L, I, N, E, R. All are allowed (L, I not yet ruled out).

""LINER"" is a valid English word.Based on the updated constraints, the only valid word that fits is:

- “RUNES” – invalid (S ruled out)
- “RINSE” – invalid (I, S ruled out)
- “RIPEN” – P allowed, but N already in position 3, E in 4, so “RIPEN” would be R I P E N – but N is supposed to be in position 3, not 5. Doesn’t fit skeleton.

Looking carefully at skeleton R _ N E _:

- R _ N E _ means positions 1=R, 2=?, 3=N, 4=E, 5=?

Possible letters for position 2 and 5 from remaining allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W.

Possible words:

- “RANES” – invalid (S)
- “RANER” – invalid (R already in 1, can’t have R in 5)

- R U N E _ – “RUNES” invalid

Wait, let’s list actual words fitting R _ N E _:

- “RUNES” – invalid (S ruled out)
- “RINSE” – invalid (I, S ruled out)
- “RIPEN” – P allowed, but N already in position 3, E in 4, so “RIPEN” would be R I P E N – but N is supposed to be in position 3, not 5. Doesn’t fit skeleton.

Looking carefully at skeleton R _ N E _:

- R _ N E _ means positions 1=R, 2=?, 3=N, 4=E, 5=?

Possible letters for position 2 and 5 from remaining allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W.

Possible words:
- R U N E _ – no valid 5-letter word
- R U N E _ – no
- R U N E _ – no
- R U N E _ – no
- R U N E _ – no

Actually, let’s list valid 5-letter words matching R _ N E _:

- “RUNES” – invalid (S ruled out)
- “RINSE” – invalid (I, S ruled out)
- “RIPEN” – doesn’t match skeleton
- “RANCH” – doesn’t match
- “RANIE” – doesn’t match
- “RANES” – invalid (S)
- “RANER” – invalid (R already in 1, can’t have R in 5)

Wait, let’s check dictionary:

Valid 5-letter words starting with R, having N in 3rd and E in 4th:

- “RINSE” – no (I, S)
- “RIPEN” – no (positions don’t match)
- “RUNES” – no (S)
- “RUGEN” – not a word
- “RUMEN” – valid word: R U M E N

Check constraints:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- U in position 2 (not yet ruled out)
- N in position 3 (matches ✓)
- E in position 4 (matches ✓)
- M in position 5 (not yet ruled out)

All letters used are allowed.

So the only valid word fitting all constraints is “RUMEN”.",Guess 5: rumen -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) U(x) M(x) E(✓) N(-),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good first guess should cover as many of these as possible. 

""AROSE"" uses A, R, O, S, E - covering 5 of the most common letters. This gives a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word, providing useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:

- A(x) → A is not in the word at all.  
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 2.  
- O(x) → O is not in the word.  
- S(x) → S is not in the word.  
- E(-) → E is in the word but NOT in position 5.

So the secret word:
- Contains R and E.  
- Does NOT contain A, O, or S.  
- R is not in position 2; E is not in position 5.

To maximize information, I want a word that:
1. Uses R and E (since we know they are in the word).  
2. Avoids A, O, S.  
3. Places R and E in new positions to test their correct spots.  
4. Introduces new common consonants and vowels that haven’t been tested yet (like T, N, L, I, C, etc.).

A good candidate is “TREND”:
- T (new consonant)  
- R (known in word, now in position 2)  
- E (known in word, now in position 3)  
- N (new consonant)  
- D (new consonant)

This tests R and E in new positions while adding three fresh letters (T, N, D) that are common in English words.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: trend -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) E(-) N(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, D  
Letters that ARE in the word: R, E, N  
Positions we have ruled out so far:
- R is NOT in position 2 (from arose) and NOT in position 2 (from trend)  
- E is NOT in position 5 (from arose) and NOT in position 3 (from trend)  
- N is NOT in position 4 (from trend)

So the secret word:
- Must contain the letters R, E, N exactly once each.  
- May NOT contain A, O, S, T, D.  
- R cannot be in position 2.  
- E cannot be in position 3 or 5.  
- N cannot be in position 4.

We need a 5-letter word that uses only letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding A, O, S, T, D) and respects the positional constraints.

Remaining common letters we can still use: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, plus the required R, E, N.

Let’s try to place R, E, N in allowed positions and fill the rest with new letters.

One promising pattern: place R in position 1 or 3, E in 1, 2, or 4, N in 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4).

Let’s try:
R _ _ _ E  → but E cannot be in position 5, so this is fine, but we still need to place N somewhere.

How about: R N E _ _  → but N cannot be in position 2 (from trend feedback), so this is invalid.

Another pattern: _ R _ E _  → R in position 2 is invalid (from arose).

Next: _ _ R E _  → R in position 3 is allowed, E in position 4 is allowed.

Let’s try _ _ R E _  and fill the blanks with new letters.

Possible letters left: B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s pick common consonants: C and H.

Word: B C R E H → but this is not a valid English word.

Try: C H R E W → not valid.

Try: P R E N _  → but R cannot be in position 2.

Try: F R E N _  → but R cannot be in position 2.

Try: _ E R N _  → E in position 2, R in position 3, N in position 4 → but N cannot be in position 4.

Try: _ E R _ N  → E in position 2, R in position 3, N in position 5 → but E cannot be in position 5 (already ruled out), and N in position 5 is allowed.

So: _ E R _ N  → need a letter in position 1 and 4.

Position 1: must be from remaining letters (B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y).

Position 4: same.

Let’s try C and H: C E R H N → not a valid word.

Try P E R L N → not valid.

Try G E R M N → not valid.

Try B E R N _  → B E R N _  → B E R N _  → but we need 5 letters.

Wait, let’s think differently: we know the word must contain R, E, N and no A, O, S, T, D.

Let’s list possible 5-letter words with R, E, N and allowed letters.

Some possibilities:
- B E R N _  → need a 5th letter, but BERN_ doesn’t make a word.
- C H E R N  → C H E R N → this is a valid word (chern is a variant spelling of ""churn"", but might be obscure).
- F R E N _  → but R cannot be in position 2.
- P R E N _  → R cannot be in position 2.
- G R E N _  → R cannot be in position 2.
- B R E N _  → R cannot be in position 2.
- C R E N _  → R cannot be in position 2.
- F R E N _  → same issue.

Try: _ N E R _  → N in position 1, E in position 3, R in position 4, but E cannot be in position 3 (from trend feedback).

Try: N E R _ _  → N in position 1, E in position 2, R in position 3, but then we need two more letters.

Word: N E R V Y  → but we haven’t tested V or Y yet, and this uses N, E, R in allowed positions.

Check constraints:
- N is in position 1: allowed (only position 4 was ruled out for N).
- E is in position 2: allowed (only positions 3 and 5 were ruled out for E).
- R is in position 3: allowed (only position 2 was ruled out for R).
- V and Y are new letters not yet tested.

""NERVY"" is a valid English word (meaning ""restless or agitated"").

Let’s go with NERVY.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: trend -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(-) E(-) N(-) D(x)
Guess 3: nervy -> FEEDBACK: N(-) E(✓) R(-) V(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the three rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, D, V, Y  
Letters that ARE in the word: R, E, N  
Exact positions we have:

- E is in position 2 (from guess 3: E(✓))  
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4 (from arose, trend, nervy)  
- N is in the word but NOT in positions 4, 5 (from trend, nervy)

So the secret word:
- Has E in position 2.
- Must contain R and N exactly once each.
- R cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4 → the only remaining spot for R is position 5.
- N cannot be in positions 4, 5 → the only remaining spot for N is position 1 or 3.
- Allowed letters so far: R, E, N plus any letters not yet ruled out (B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, W, etc.).

Current skeleton:
- Position 1: must be N or another allowed letter.
- Position 2: E (fixed).
- Position 3: must be N or another allowed letter.
- Position 4: must be another allowed letter.
- Position 5: R (forced).

But N cannot be in positions 4 or 5, and position 5 is already R, so N must be in position 1 or 3.

Case 1: N in position 1 → N E _ _ R
Case 2: N in position 3 → _ E N _ R

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits one of these patterns using only allowed letters.

Case 1: N E _ _ R
Possible letters for positions 3 and 4: any not yet ruled out (B, C, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, W).
Looking for common words:
- N E B U R → ""nebur"" (not a word)
- N E C K R → ""necker"" (not standard)
- N E P R → too short
- N E C K R → no
- N E W R → no

Case 2: _ E N _ R
Looking for words like:
- B E N _ R → ""benar"" (no)
- C E N _ R → ""cenar"" (no)
- F E N _ R → ""fenar"" (no)
- G E N _ R → ""genar"" (no)
- H E N _ R → ""henar"" (no)
- K E N _ R → ""kenar"" (no)
- L E N _ R → ""lenar"" (no)
- M E N _ R → ""menar"" (no)
- P E N _ R → ""penar"" (no)
- U E N _ R → ""uenar"" (no)
- W E N _ R → ""wenar"" (no)

Wait, let's think of actual valid words:
- ""BENCH"" is 5 letters but ends with CH, not R.
- ""FENCE"" is 5 letters but ends with CE, not R.
- ""GENRE"" is 5 letters: G E N R E → but we need R in position 5, and E in position 2, so this would be G E N E R → ""gender"" (but has D which is ruled out).
- ""MENOR"" is not a word.
- ""PERON"" is a word (short for ""peronospora"" or ""peron""), but P is allowed, E is in position 2, R is in position 5, N is in position 3.

Check ""PERON"":
- P E R O N → but O is ruled out.
- ""PERON"" uses O which is invalid.

Next: ""CENRE"" is not a word.
""FENRE"" is not a word.
""GONER"" is 5 letters: G O N E R → but O is ruled out.
""HENRE"" is not a word.
""LINER"" is a valid word:
- L I N E R → but I is allowed, N is in position 3, E is in position 2, R is in position 5. This fits all constraints:
  - Contains R, E, N.
  - R is in position 5 (allowed).
  - E is in position 2 (matches feedback).
  - N is in position 3 (allowed).
  - Letters used: L, I, N, E, R. All are allowed (L, I not yet ruled out).

""LINER"" is a valid English word.Based on the updated constraints, the only valid word that fits is:

From all feedback so far:

Letters known NOT in the word: A, O, S, T, D, V, Y, L, I  
Letters known TO be in the word: R, E, N  
Exact positions we now have:

- E is in position 4 (from guess 4: E(✓) in position 4).  
- N is in position 3 (from guess 4: N(✓) in position 3).  
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 (from arose, trend, nervy, liner).  
  – The only remaining spot for R is position 1.

So the secret word must be of the form:  
R _ N E _

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with R, has N in position 3 and E in position 4, and uses only allowed letters.

Possible skeleton: R _ N E _

Looking for valid words:
- R B N E _ – no
- R C N E _ – no
- R F N E _ – no
- R G N E _ – no
- R H N E _ – no
- R M N E _ – no
- R P N E _ – no
- R U N E _ – “RUNES” (but ends with S which is ruled out)
- R U N E _ – “RUNER” (not a word)
- R U N E _ – “RUNES” invalid
- R U N E _ – “RUNER” invalid
- R U N E _ – “RUNES” invalid

Wait, let’s list actual words fitting R _ N E _:

- “RUNES” – invalid (S ruled out)
- “RINSE” – invalid (I, S ruled out)
- “RIPEN” – P allowed, but N already in position 3, E in 4, so “RIPEN” would be R I P E N – but N is supposed to be in position 3, not 5. Doesn’t fit skeleton.

Looking carefully at skeleton R _ N E _:

- R _ N E _ means positions 1=R, 2=?, 3=N, 4=E, 5=?

Possible letters for position 2 and 5 from remaining allowed letters: B, C, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, W.

Possible words:
- R U N E _ – no valid 5-letter word
- R U N E _ – no
- R U N E _ – no
- R U N E _ – no
- R U N E _ – no

Actually, let’s list valid 5-letter words matching R _ N E _:

- “RUNES” – invalid (S ruled out)
- “RINSE” – invalid (I, S ruled out)
- “RIPEN” – doesn’t match skeleton
- “RANCH” – doesn’t match
- “RANIE” – doesn’t match
- “RANES” – invalid (S)
- “RANER” – invalid (R already in 1, can’t have R in 5)

Wait, let’s check dictionary:

Valid 5-letter words starting with R, having N in 3rd and E in 4th:

- “RINSE” – no (I, S)
- “RIPEN” – no (positions don’t match)
- “RUNES” – no (S)
- “RUGEN” – not a word
- “RUMEN” – valid word: R U M E N

Check constraints:
- R in position 1 (allowed)
- U in position 2 (not yet ruled out)
- N in position 3 (matches ✓)
- E in position 4 (matches ✓)
- M in position 5 (not yet ruled out)

All letters used are allowed.

So the only valid word fitting all constraints is “RUMEN”.

From all feedback so far:

Letters known NOT in the word:  
A, O, S, T, D, V, Y, L, I, U, M  

Letters known TO be in the word and their exact positions:  
- R is in position 1 (from rumen: R(✓))  
- E is in position 4 (from liner and rumen: E(✓))  
- N is in position 3 (from liner: N(✓))  

So the skeleton is fixed:  
R _ N E _

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):  
B, C, F, G, H, K, P, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word of the form R ? N E ? using only the allowed letters.

Looking at the skeleton R _ N E _ and the remaining allowed letters:

- Position 2: must be one of B, C, F, G, H, K, P, W  
- Position 5: must be one of B, C, F, G, H, K, P, W  

Valid English 5-letter words fitting R ? N E ?:

- R B N E _ – no  
- R C N E _ – no  
- R F N E _ – no  
- R G N E _ – no  
- R H N E _ – no  
- R P N E _ – no  
- R W N E _ – no  

But “RUGEN” is not a word, “RIPEN” doesn’t fit the skeleton, etc.

Actually, the only valid English word fitting R _ N E _ with the allowed letters is:

R U N E _ – but U is ruled out.  
So we must look elsewhere.

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter words that start with R, have N in position 3, E in position 4, and use only the still-allowed letters:

Allowed letters left: B, C, F, G, H, K, P, W

Possible combinations:

- R B N E _ – no valid word  
- R C N E _ – no  
- R F N E _ – no  
- R G N E _ – no  
- R H N E _ – no  
- R K N E _ – no  
- R P N E _ – no  
- R W N E _ – no  

But “RUMEN” already used and failed at position 5.  
We missed “RIPEN” because it doesn’t fit the skeleton.  

Re-examining the skeleton: R _ N E _ must have N in 3 and E in 4.

Valid word: “RIPEN” – but positions would be R I P E N – N is in 5, not 3. Doesn’t fit.

Another valid word: “RUGES” – but U and S are ruled out.

Wait, let’s think differently: the skeleton is R _ N E _, and the only possible letters left are B, C, F, G, H, K, P, W.

Possible words:

- R B N E _ – no  
- R C N E _ – no  
- R F N E _ – no

Actually, the only valid word left is:

R U N E _ – but U is invalid.

Wait, let me double-check the remaining letters.
