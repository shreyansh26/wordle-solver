### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, N, L, etc. 

One of the most common starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives good coverage of common letters and positions to maximize information gain.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T are not in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (–).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (–).

So the secret word:
- Contains A and E.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T.
- A is not in position 3.
- E is not in position 5.

Next, I want a word that:
- Uses A and E (which we know are in the word).
- Avoids S, L, T.
- Places A somewhere other than position 3.
- Places E somewhere other than position 5.

A good candidate is ""EARLY"":
- Contains A and E.
- Does not contain S, L, T.
- A is in position 2 (not 3), E is in position 1 (not 5).
- Uses common letters R and Y to gather more information.

This should help narrow down the remaining letters and positions.

- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, Y.  
- E cannot be in position 1 or 5 (from SLATE feedback).  
- R cannot be in position 3.

- Has A in position 2.  
- Contains E and R somewhere else.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters like A, E, I, O, U, R, S, T, N, L, etc. 

One of the most common starting words in Wordle is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives good coverage of common letters and positions to maximize information gain.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T are not in the word at all (x).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (–).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (–).

So the secret word:
- Contains A and E.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T.
- A is not in position 3.
- E is not in position 5.

Next, I want a word that:
- Uses A and E (which we know are in the word).
- Avoids S, L, T.
- Places A somewhere other than position 3.
- Places E somewhere other than position 5.

A good candidate is ""EARLY"":
- Contains A and E.
- Does not contain S, L, T.
- A is in position 2 (not 3), E is in position 1 (not 5).
- Uses common letters R and Y to gather more information.

This should help narrow down the remaining letters and positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(-)
Guess 2: EARLY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s digest the new feedback on EARLY:

1. E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
2. A(✓) – A is in the word AND in position 2.  
3. R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
4. L(x) – L is NOT in the word.  
5. Y(x) – Y is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: A (position 2), E, R.  
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, T, Y.  
- E cannot be in position 1 or 5 (from SLATE feedback).  
- R cannot be in position 3.  

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2.  
- Contains E and R somewhere else.  
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, Y.  

A quick scan of common letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
We want common consonants to test positions.  

A good candidate that fits:
- A in position 2.  
- Uses E and R in new positions.  
- Avoids forbidden letters.  

“BREAD” comes to mind, but D is allowed, and it places:
- A in position 2 (✓).  
- E in position 4 (allowed).  
- R in position 3 (but feedback says R is not in position 3).  
Oops, conflict.  

Try “CRANE”:
- A in position 2 (✓).  
- E in position 5 (but feedback says E is not in position 5).  
Conflict again.  

Try “FRAKE”:
- A in position 2 (✓).  
- E in position 5 (conflict).  

Try “GRAPE”:
- A in position 2 (✓).  
- E in position 5 (conflict).

Try “CARET”:
- T is forbidden.  

Try “CARES”:

Try “DARES”:

Try “FARCE”:

- A in position 2 (✓).  
- R in position 3 (conflict, R cannot be in position 3).  

Try “GARRE”:
- Double R is allowed, but R is in position 3 (conflict).  

Try “PAREU” (Spanish, invalid).  

Try “MARGE” already tried.  

Try “CAREE”:
- E in position 5 (conflict).  

Try “CARES” – S forbidden.  

Try “CARET” – T forbidden.  

Try “DARES” – S forbidden.  

Try “FARCE” – R in position 3 (conflict).  

Try “HARPS” – S forbidden.  

Try “HARDE” – not a word.  

Try “HARLE” – L forbidden.  

Try “HARMS” – S forbidden.  

Try “HAREM”:
- A in position 2 (✓).  
- E in position 4 (allowed).  
- R in position 3 (conflict).  

Try “HARPS” – S forbidden.  

Try “JARED”:
- A in position 2 (✓).  
- E in position 4 (allowed).  
- R in position 3 (conflict).  

Try “JERKY”:
- Y forbidden.  

Try “JERSE” – not a word.  

Try “JERKY” – Y forbidden.  

Try “KARTE” – T forbidden.  

Try “KAREE”:
- A in position 2 (✓).  
- E in position 4 (allowed).  
- R in position 3 (conflict).  

Try “MARGE” – E in position 5 (conflict).  

Try “MAREE”:
- A in position 2 (✓).  
- E in position 4 (allowed).  
- R in position 3 (conflict).  

Try “PAREU” – invalid.  

Try “PARES” – S forbidden.  

Try “PARES” – S forbidden.  

Try “VARES” – S forbidden.  

Try “WARGE” – not a word.  

Try “WARRA” – not a word.  

Try “WARM” – too short.  

Try “WARMS” – S forbidden.  

Try “WARY” – too short.  

Try “WATER”:
- A in position 2 (✓).  
- E in position 4 (allowed).  
- R in position 5 (allowed).  
- T is forbidden.  

Conflict: T is forbidden.  

Try “WATER” – T forbidden.  

Try “WAGER”:
- A in position 2 (✓).  
- E in position 4 (allowed).  
- R in position 5 (allowed).  
- G is allowed.  

This seems valid:
- Letters: W, A, G, E, R.  
- A is in position 2.  
- Contains E and R.  
- No S, L, T, Y.  
- E is in position 4 (allowed).  
- R is in position 5 (allowed).  

Let’s use “WAGER”.
