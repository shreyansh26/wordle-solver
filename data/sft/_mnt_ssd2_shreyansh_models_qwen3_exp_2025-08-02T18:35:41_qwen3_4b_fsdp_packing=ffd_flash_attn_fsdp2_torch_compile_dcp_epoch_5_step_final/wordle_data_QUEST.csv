### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

After considering these factors, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- These letters appear frequently in 5-letter English words
- It has a good balance of high-frequency letters

From all feedback so far:

Letters known to be absent: A, R, O, I, L, X  
Letters known to be present: S, E  

Exact positions:
- S is in the word but is NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from STILE and EXSES).  
  Therefore S must be in position 2.

- E is in the word but is NOT in positions 1, 2, 5 (from AROSE, STILE, EXSES).  
  Therefore E must be in position 3 or 4.

So the word has the pattern:
_ S _ _ _   (S in position 2)
with E in position 3 or 4.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits:
- 2nd letter = S
- 3rd letter = E or 4th letter = E

Possible patterns:
- _ S E _ _
- _ S _ _ E

Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, I, L, X  
We can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, Y, Z

Let’s look for common words.

Pattern _ S E _ _ :
- ""USES"" is 4 letters, no.
- ""HUES"" is 4 letters.
- ""MUSES"" is 5 letters but has E in position 4 (not 3) and ends with S, but we need 5 letters ending in _.

Pattern _ S _ _ E :
- ""TENSE"" – T, N, C are allowed, E in position 5 (but E can’t be in 5).
- ""MENSE"" – not a valid word.
- ""PENSE"" – not valid.
- ""DENSE"" – D, N, S, E – E in position 5 (invalid).
- ""GENSE"" – not valid.
- ""WENSE"" – not valid.
- ""FENSE"" – not valid.

Pattern _ S E _ _ :
- ""MUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""HUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""PUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""BUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""CUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""DUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""GUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""JUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""KUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""MUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""NUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""PUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""QUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""TUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""VUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""WUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""YUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""ZUSE"" is 4 letters.

Hmm, these are all 4 letters. Let me think of 5-letter words with S in position 2 and E in position 3 or 4.

- ""HASTE"" – H, A, S, T, E – A is invalid.
- ""MOSSE"" – M, O, S, S, E – O is invalid.
- ""PESOS"" – P, E, S, O, S – O is invalid.
- ""TENSE"" – T, E, N, S, E – E in 2 and 5 (invalid for E).
- ""WIPES"" – W, I, P, E, S – I is invalid.
- ""YES"" is 3 letters.
- ""USES"" is 4 letters.

Wait, let me think differently. The word must be _ S _ _ _ with E in 3 or 4.

Valid words:
- ""MUSES"" – M, U, S, E, S – U is allowed, S in 2 and 5, E in 4. This fits:
  - S is in position 2 (not 1,3,4,5 – but in MUSES S is in 2 and 5, but we know S must be in 2 only once. However, the feedback didn’t say S can’t appear twice.)
  - E is in position 4 (valid).
  - Uses new letters M, U.

But is ""MUSES"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it means ""the songs of Musa"" or ""to sing songs"".

Another option: ""PESOS"" – but O is invalid.
""USES"" is 4 letters.
""BUSES"" – B, U, S, E, S – B, U, S, E, S – fits:
- S in 2 and 5 (but we know S must be in 2, so this is okay if S can appear twice.)
- E in 4 (valid).
- Uses B, U.

But we have only 6 guesses left, and we need to maximize information. ""MUSES"" and ""BUSES"" are both valid.

Let me choose ""MUSES"" as it uses M and U which are new letters.

But wait, let me check if there's a better fit. Another word: ""HUSES"" – H, U, S, E, S – same as above.

Actually, ""MUSES"" seems best.

But let me think if there's a word with E in position 3: _ S E _ _
- ""MUSES"" has E in 4.
- ""PESOS"" has E in 2 (invalid).
- ""WESER"" – not valid.
- ""HESIT"" – not valid.

It seems ""MUSES"" is the best fit with E in 4.

But let me check ""MUSES"" against the constraints:
- S is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- No A, R, O, I, L, X (✓)
- Uses new letters M, U (✓)

This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""PESOS"" – but O is invalid.
""FUSES"" – F, U, S, E, S – F, U, S, E, S – same as above with F instead of M.

""FUSES"" seems better as F is a new letter.

Let me choose ""FUSES"".

But let me verify:
- F: new letter
- U: new letter
- S: position 2 (✓)
- E: position 4 (✓)
- S: position 5 (allowed, since S can appear twice)

This seems optimal.

Therefore, the next guess is ""FUSES"".

From all feedback we now know:
- S must be in position 2 (only remaining spot).
- E must be in position 3 or 4 (cannot be 1, 2, or 5).
- Letters A, R, O, I, L, X are excluded.

A valid word fitting these constraints is “FUSES”:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

After considering these factors, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- These letters appear frequently in 5-letter English words
- It has a good balance of high-frequency letters

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(✓) → S is in the word and in the 4th position.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So the secret word has:
- S in position 4
- E somewhere in positions 1-3 or 5 (but not 5, so positions 1-3)
- No A, R, or O

Good next guesses should:
1. Keep S in position 4.
2. Move E to a new position (1, 2, or 3).
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tried (T, L, N, I, C, etc.).

A strong candidate is ""STILE"":
- S stays in position 4.
- E moves to position 2.
- Introduces T, I, L which are common and haven't been tested.

Guess 2: STILE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) I(x) L(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. A, R, O, I, L are all absent.
2. S is in the word but is NOT in position 4 (because in STILE it got “-” instead of “✓”).
3. E is in the word but is NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from AROSE and STILE).

So far:
- S must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- E must appear in position 1, 3, or 4.

We need a word that:
- Uses S and E.
- Keeps S away from position 4.
- Keeps E away from positions 2 and 5.
- Avoids A, R, O, I, L.

A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is “SEWED”:
- S is in position 1.
- E is in position 2 (but we already know E can’t be in position 2 from STILE feedback). Oops, that’s invalid.

Let’s try “SECTS”:
- S in position 1 and 5.
- E in position 2 (again invalid).

Next candidate: “STEEP” – but P hasn’t been tested yet, and E is in position 2 again.

Try “EXSES”:
- E in position 1 (valid).
- S in positions 2, 3, 5 (valid).
- Uses new letters X and another S.

This seems valid and informative.

From all feedback so far:

Letters known to be absent: A, R, O, I, L, X  
Letters known to be present: S, E  

Exact positions:
- S is in the word but is NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from STILE and EXSES).  
  Therefore S must be in position 2.

- E is in the word but is NOT in positions 1, 2, 5 (from AROSE, STILE, EXSES).  
  Therefore E must be in position 3 or 4.

So the word has the pattern:
_ S _ _ _   (S in position 2)
with E in position 3 or 4.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits:
- 2nd letter = S
- 3rd letter = E or 4th letter = E

Possible patterns:
- _ S E _ _
- _ S _ _ E

Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, I, L, X  
We can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, Y, Z

Let’s look for common words.

Pattern _ S E _ _ :
- ""USES"" is 4 letters, no.
- ""HUES"" is 4 letters.
- ""MUSES"" is 5 letters but has E in position 4 (not 3) and ends with S, but we need 5 letters ending in _.

Pattern _ S _ _ E :
- ""TENSE"" – T, N, C are allowed, E in position 5 (but E can’t be in 5).
- ""MENSE"" – not a valid word.
- ""PENSE"" – not valid.
- ""DENSE"" – D, N, S, E – E in position 5 (invalid).
- ""GENSE"" – not valid.
- ""WENSE"" – not valid.
- ""FENSE"" – not valid.

Pattern _ S E _ _ :
- ""MUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""HUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""PUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""BUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""CUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""DUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""GUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""JUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""KUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""MUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""NUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""PUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""QUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""TUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""VUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""WUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""YUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""ZUSE"" is 4 letters.

Hmm, these are all 4 letters. Let me think of 5-letter words with S in position 2 and E in position 3 or 4.

- ""HASTE"" – H, A, S, T, E – A is invalid.
- ""MOSSE"" – M, O, S, S, E – O is invalid.
- ""PESOS"" – P, E, S, O, S – O is invalid.
- ""TENSE"" – T, E, N, S, E – E in 2 and 5 (invalid for E).
- ""WIPES"" – W, I, P, E, S – I is invalid.
- ""YES"" is 3 letters.
- ""USES"" is 4 letters.

Wait, let me think differently. The word must be _ S _ _ _ with E in 3 or 4.

Valid words:
- ""MUSES"" – M, U, S, E, S – U is allowed, S in 2 and 5, E in 4. This fits:
  - S is in position 2 (not 1,3,4,5 – but in MUSES S is in 2 and 5, but we know S must be in 2 only once. However, the feedback didn’t say S can’t appear twice.)
  - E is in position 4 (valid).
  - Uses new letters M, U.

But is ""MUSES"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it means ""the songs of Musa"" or ""to sing songs"".

Another option: ""PESOS"" – but O is invalid.
""USES"" is 4 letters.
""BUSES"" – B, U, S, E, S – B, U, S, E, S – fits:
- S in 2 and 5 (but we know S must be in 2, so this is okay if S can appear twice.)
- E in 4 (valid).
- Uses B, U.

But we have only 6 guesses left, and we need to maximize information. ""MUSES"" and ""BUSES"" are both valid.

Let me choose ""MUSES"" as it uses M and U which are new letters.

But wait, let me check if there's a better fit. Another word: ""HUSES"" – H, U, S, E, S – same as above.

Actually, ""MUSES"" seems best.

But let me think if there's a word with E in position 3: _ S E _ _
- ""MUSES"" has E in 4.
- ""PESOS"" has E in 2 (invalid).
- ""WESER"" – not valid.
- ""HESIT"" – not valid.

It seems ""MUSES"" is the best fit with E in 4.

But let me check ""MUSES"" against the constraints:
- S is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- No A, R, O, I, L, X (✓)
- Uses new letters M, U (✓)

This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""PESOS"" – but O is invalid.
""FUSES"" – F, U, S, E, S – F, U, S, E, S – same as above with F instead of M.

""FUSES"" seems better as F is a new letter.

Let me choose ""FUSES"".

But let me verify:
- F: new letter
- U: new letter
- S: position 2 (✓)
- E: position 4 (✓)
- S: position 5 (allowed, since S can appear twice)

This seems optimal.

Therefore, the next guess is ""FUSES"".From all feedback we now know:
- S must be in position 2 (only remaining spot).
- E must be in position 3 or 4 (cannot be 1, 2, or 5).
- Letters A, R, O, I, L, X are excluded.

A valid word fitting these constraints is “FUSES”:
- F, U are new letters.
- S is in position 2.
- E is in position 4.

From all feedback so far:

Letters known to be absent: A, R, O, I, L, X, F  
Letters known to be present: S, E, U  

Exact positions:
- S is in the word but is NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from STILE, EXSES, FUSES).  
  Therefore S must be in position 2.

- E is in the word but is NOT in positions 2, 3, 5 (from AROSE, STILE, EXSES, FUSES).  
  Therefore E must be in position 4.

- U is in the word and is in position 2 (from FUSES feedback: U(✓)).

So the word must look like:
_ U _ _ _ with S in position 2 and E in position 4.  
Wait, that can’t be: position 2 is already U.

Let me re-summarize the position information carefully:

1. S must be in position 2 (only spot left after ruling out 1,3,4,5).
2. E must be in position 4 (only spot left after ruling out 1,2,3,5).
3. U is in position 2 (from FUSES feedback: U(✓)).

This creates a contradiction: position 2 cannot simultaneously be S and U.  
Re-examining the feedback:

- Guess 4: FUSES -> F(x) U(✓) S(-) E(-) S(-)

The symbols are applied to each letter in order:
- F(x) → F not in word.
- U(✓) → U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 3.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 4.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 5.

So:
- S must be in position 2 (only remaining spot after ruling out 1,3,4,5).
- U is in position 2 (from U(✓)).

This is impossible unless S and U are the same letter, which they are not.  
Therefore, my earlier interpretation must be flawed.

Re-reading the feedback carefully:

Guess 4: F U S E S  
Feedback: F(x) U(✓) S(-) E(-) S(-)

This means:
- F is not in the word.
- U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- S is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 4.
- S is in the word but not in position 5.

So:
- Position 2 is U (fixed).
- S must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 3 or 5? Wait: S(-) means S is not in position 3 and not in position 5. So S must be in position 1 or 4.
- E must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2,4).

But position 2 is already U, so the word is: _ U _ _ _

Possible patterns:
- S in position 1: S U _ _ _
- S in position 4: _ U _ S _

E must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

So:
- If S is in position 1: S U _ _ _, E must be in 3 or 5: S U E _ _ or S U _ _ E
- If S is in position 4: _ U _ S _, E must be in 1 or 3: E U _ S _ or _ U E S _

Letters already excluded: A, R, O, I, L, X, F

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting one of these patterns.

Pattern 1: S U E _ _
- ""SUEDE"" – D is new, E in 5 (allowed), D is allowed. This fits:
  - S in 1 (allowed)
  - U in 2 (✓)
  - E in 3 (allowed)
  - D is new
  - E in 5 (allowed)

Pattern 2: S U _ _ E

Pattern 4: E U _ S _
- ""EUGEN"" – not valid.
- ""ELUS"" is 4 letters.
- ""EXUS"" – X is excluded.
- ""EULUS"" – not valid.

The only valid word fitting all constraints is ""SUEDE"":
- S in 1 (allowed)
- U in 2 (✓)
- E in 3 (allowed)
- D is new
- E in 5 (allowed)

This satisfies every constraint derived from the feedback.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions. A good starting word should have:
1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.)
3. No repeating letters to maximize information gain

After considering these factors, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because:
- It contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S)
- All letters are distinct
- These letters appear frequently in 5-letter English words
- It has a good balance of high-frequency letters

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(✓) → S is in the word and in the 4th position.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

So the secret word has:
- S in position 4
- E somewhere in positions 1-3 or 5 (but not 5, so positions 1-3)
- No A, R, or O

Good next guesses should:
1. Keep S in position 4.
2. Move E to a new position (1, 2, or 3).
3. Introduce new common letters not yet tried (T, L, N, I, C, etc.).

A strong candidate is ""STILE"":
- S stays in position 4.
- E moves to position 2.
- Introduces T, I, L which are common and haven't been tested.

Guess 2: STILE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) I(x) L(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. A, R, O, I, L are all absent.
2. S is in the word but is NOT in position 4 (because in STILE it got “-” instead of “✓”).
3. E is in the word but is NOT in positions 2 or 5 (from AROSE and STILE).

So far:
- S must appear somewhere in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- E must appear in position 1, 3, or 4.

We need a word that:
- Uses S and E.
- Keeps S away from position 4.
- Keeps E away from positions 2 and 5.
- Avoids A, R, O, I, L.

A good candidate that satisfies these constraints is “SEWED”:
- S is in position 1.
- E is in position 2 (but we already know E can’t be in position 2 from STILE feedback). Oops, that’s invalid.

Let’s try “SECTS”:
- S in position 1 and 5.
- E in position 2 (again invalid).

Next candidate: “STEEP” – but P hasn’t been tested yet, and E is in position 2 again.

Try “EXSES”:
- E in position 1 (valid).
- S in positions 2, 3, 5 (valid).
- Uses new letters X and another S.

This seems valid and informative.

Letters known to be absent: A, R, O, I, L, X  
Letters known to be present: S, E  

Exact positions:
- S is in the word but is NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from STILE and EXSES).  
  Therefore S must be in position 2.

- E is in the word but is NOT in positions 1, 2, 5 (from AROSE, STILE, EXSES).  
  Therefore E must be in position 3 or 4.

So the word has the pattern:
_ S _ _ _   (S in position 2)
with E in position 3 or 4.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits:
- 2nd letter = S
- 3rd letter = E or 4th letter = E

Possible patterns:
- _ S E _ _
- _ S _ _ E

Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, I, L, X  
We can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, Y, Z

Let’s look for common words.

Pattern _ S E _ _ :
- ""USES"" is 4 letters, no.
- ""HUES"" is 4 letters.
- ""MUSES"" is 5 letters but has E in position 4 (not 3) and ends with S, but we need 5 letters ending in _.

Pattern _ S _ _ E :
- ""TENSE"" – T, N, C are allowed, E in position 5 (but E can’t be in 5).
- ""MENSE"" – not a valid word.
- ""PENSE"" – not valid.
- ""DENSE"" – D, N, S, E – E in position 5 (invalid).
- ""GENSE"" – not valid.
- ""WENSE"" – not valid.
- ""FENSE"" – not valid.

Pattern _ S E _ _ :
- ""MUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""HUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""PUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""BUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""CUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""DUSE"" is 4 letters.
- ""GUSE"" is 4 letters.

Hmm, these are all 4 letters. Let me think of 5-letter words with S in position 2 and E in position 3 or 4.

- ""HASTE"" – H, A, S, T, E – A is invalid.
- ""MOSSE"" – M, O, S, S, E – O is invalid.
- ""PESOS"" – P, E, S, O, S – O is invalid.
- ""TENSE"" – T, E, N, S, E – E in 2 and 5 (invalid for E).
- ""WIPES"" – W, I, P, E, S – I is invalid.
- ""YES"" is 3 letters.
- ""USES"" is 4 letters.

Wait, let me think differently. The word must be _ S _ _ _ with E in 3 or 4.

Valid words:
- ""MUSES"" – M, U, S, E, S – U is allowed, S in 2 and 5, E in 4. This fits:
  - S is in position 2 (not 1,3,4,5 – but in MUSES S is in 2 and 5, but we know S must be in 2 only once. However, the feedback didn’t say S can’t appear twice.)
  - E is in position 4 (valid).
  - Uses new letters M, U.

But is ""MUSES"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it means ""the songs of Musa"" or ""to sing songs"".

Another option: ""PESOS"" – but O is invalid.
""USES"" is 4 letters.
""BUSES"" – B, U, S, E, S – B, U, S, E, S – fits:
- S in 2 and 5 (but we know S must be in 2, so this is okay if S can appear twice.)
- E in 4 (valid).
- Uses B, U.

But we have only 6 guesses left, and we need to maximize information. ""MUSES"" and ""BUSES"" are both valid.

Let me choose ""MUSES"" as it uses M and U which are new letters.

But wait, let me check if there's a better fit. Another word: ""HUSES"" – H, U, S, E, S – same as above.

Actually, ""MUSES"" seems best.

But let me think if there's a word with E in position 3: _ S E _ _
- ""MUSES"" has E in 4.
- ""PESOS"" has E in 2 (invalid).
- ""WESER"" – not valid.
- ""HESIT"" – not valid.

It seems ""MUSES"" is the best fit with E in 4.

But let me check ""MUSES"" against the constraints:
- S is in position 2 (✓)
- E is in position 4 (✓)
- No A, R, O, I, L, X (✓)
- Uses new letters M, U (✓)

This seems valid.

Another candidate: ""PESOS"" – but O is invalid.
""FUSES"" – F, U, S, E, S – F, U, S, E, S – same as above with F instead of M.

""FUSES"" seems better as F is a new letter.

Let me choose ""FUSES"".

But let me verify:
- F: new letter
- U: new letter
- S: position 2 (✓)
- E: position 4 (✓)
- S: position 5 (allowed, since S can appear twice)

This seems optimal.

Therefore, the next guess is ""FUSES"".From all feedback we now know:
- S must be in position 2 (only remaining spot).
- E must be in position 3 or 4 (cannot be 1, 2, or 5).
- Letters A, R, O, I, L, X are excluded.

A valid word fitting these constraints is “FUSES”:
- F, U are new letters.
- S is in position 2.
- E is in position 4.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STILE -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(-) I(x) L(x) E(-)
Guess 3: EXSES -> FEEDBACK: E(-) X(x) S(-) E(-) S(-)
Guess 4: FUSES -> FEEDBACK: F(x) U(✓) S(-) E(-) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From all feedback so far:

Letters known to be absent: A, R, O, I, L, X, F  
Letters known to be present: S, E, U  

Exact positions:
- S is in the word but is NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from STILE, EXSES, FUSES).  
  Therefore S must be in position 2.

- E is in the word but is NOT in positions 2, 3, 5 (from AROSE, STILE, EXSES, FUSES).  
  Therefore E must be in position 4.

- U is in the word and is in position 2 (from FUSES feedback: U(✓)).

So the word must look like:
_ U _ _ _ with S in position 2 and E in position 4.  
Wait, that can’t be: position 2 is already U.

Let me re-summarize the position information carefully:

1. S must be in position 2 (only spot left after ruling out 1,3,4,5).
2. E must be in position 4 (only spot left after ruling out 1,2,3,5).
3. U is in position 2 (from FUSES feedback: U(✓)).

This creates a contradiction: position 2 cannot simultaneously be S and U.  
Re-examining the feedback:

- Guess 4: FUSES -> F(x) U(✓) S(-) E(-) S(-)

The symbols are applied to each letter in order:
- F(x) → F not in word.
- U(✓) → U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 3.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 4.
- S(-) → S is in the word but not in position 5.

So:
- S must be in position 2 (only remaining spot after ruling out 1,3,4,5).
- U is in position 2 (from U(✓)).

This is impossible unless S and U are the same letter, which they are not.  
Therefore, my earlier interpretation must be flawed.

Re-reading the feedback carefully:

Guess 4: F U S E S  
Feedback: F(x) U(✓) S(-) E(-) S(-)

This means:
- F is not in the word.
- U is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- S is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 4.
- S is in the word but not in position 5.

So:
- Position 2 is U (fixed).
- S must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (but not 3 or 5? Wait: S(-) means S is not in position 3 and not in position 5. So S must be in position 1 or 4.
- E must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (but not 2,4).

But position 2 is already U, so the word is: _ U _ _ _

Possible patterns:
- S in position 1: S U _ _ _
- S in position 4: _ U _ S _

E must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

So:
- If S is in position 1: S U _ _ _, E must be in 3 or 5: S U E _ _ or S U _ _ E
- If S is in position 4: _ U _ S _, E must be in 1 or 3: E U _ S _ or _ U E S _

Letters already excluded: A, R, O, I, L, X, F

We need a valid 5-letter word fitting one of these patterns.

Pattern 1: S U E _ _
- ""SUEDE"" – D is new, E in 5 (allowed), D is allowed. This fits:
  - S in 1 (allowed)
  - U in 2 (✓)
  - E in 3 (allowed)
  - D is new
  - E in 5 (allowed)

Pattern 2: S U _ _ E
- ""SUGUE"" – not a valid word.
- ""SUNGE"" – not valid.
- ""SUITE"" – I is excluded.

Pattern 3: _ U _ S _
- ""NUDSE"" – not valid.
- ""PUDSE"" – not valid.
- ""WUASE"" – not valid.
- ""CUSE"" is 4 letters.

Pattern 4: E U _ S _
- ""EUGEN"" – not valid.
- ""ELUS"" is 4 letters.
- ""EXUS"" – X is excluded.
- ""EULUS"" – not valid.

The only valid word fitting all constraints is ""SUEDE"":
- S in 1 (allowed)
- U in 2 (✓)
- E in 3 (allowed)
- D is new
- E in 5 (allowed)

This satisfies every constraint derived from the feedback.

  - From Guess 2: S(-) in STILE means S is not in position 1  
  - From Guess 3: S(-) in EXSES means S is not in position 3  
  - From Guess 4: S(-) in FUSES means S is not in position 3  
  - From Guess 5: S(-) in SUEDE means S is not in position 1  
  - Therefore S must be in position 4 (only remaining spot)

Thus the word must be: _ U E S _

Letters already excluded: A, R, O, I, L, X, F, D

We need a 5-letter word with pattern _ U E S _ using only allowed letters.

Possible candidates:
- ""NUES_"" – not valid
- ""PUESE"" – not valid
- ""CUES_"" – not 5 letters
- ""MUSES"" – M, U, S, E, S – fits pattern _ U E S _ (M in 1, S in 5) but S is allowed in 5 (only ruled out of 1,3,4)
- ""WUESE"" – not valid
- ""GUESS"" – G, U, E, S, S – fits _ U E S _ (G in 1, S in 5)

Between MUSES and GUESS:
- MUSES: M, U, S, E, S – S appears twice, which is allowed
- GUESS: G, U, E, S, S – same, S appears twice

Both are valid, but GUESS is more common.

Let's try GUESS.",Guess 6: GUESS -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(✓) E(✓) S(✓) S(-),FAIL
