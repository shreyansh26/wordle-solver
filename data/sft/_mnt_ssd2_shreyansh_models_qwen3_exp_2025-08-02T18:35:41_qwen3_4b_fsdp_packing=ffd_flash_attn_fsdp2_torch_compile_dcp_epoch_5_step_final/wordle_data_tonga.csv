For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", etc. 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E - covers common consonants and vowels
- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E - similar
- AROSE uses A, R, O, S, E - very common letters

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving me good coverage for identifying letters in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 1)
- R is NOT in the word
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 3)
- S is NOT in the word
- E is NOT in the word

So we know:
- The word contains A and O, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain R, S, or E.

To maximize information, the next guess should:
1. Include A and O in new positions.
2. Use other common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, N, L, C, etc.).
3. Avoid R, S, E.

A good candidate is ""TAOON"" (but that repeats O). Instead, let's try ""TAOIC"" - but that's not a common word. Better: ""TONAL"" - but it has L which is common. However, we already know E is out, but L hasn't been tested.

Another option: ""COAT"" is 4 letters. ""COATI"" is 5 letters but less common. 

A strong, common word that fits is ""TALON"":
- T, L, N are new letters.
- A is moved to position 2 (was position 1).
- O is moved to position 4 (was position 3).

This tests new consonants while placing known letters in new spots.

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", etc. 

Looking at these options:

- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E - similar
- AROSE uses A, R, O, S, E - very common letters

- R, S, E are not in the word
- O is in the word but not in position 3

Round 2 (TALON):
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 1)
- A is in the word but not in position 2
- L is not in the word
- O is in the word but not in position 4
- N is in the word but not in position 5

What we now know:
- The word starts with T (position 1)
- It contains A, O, N (all still possible)
- It does NOT contain R, S, E, L
- A is not in position 1 or 2
- O is not in position 3 or 4
- N is not in position 5

We need a 5-letter word beginning with T, containing A, O, N, with A not in position 2, O not in 3 or 4, and N not in 5. Also avoiding R, S, E, L.

Possible positions:
- Position 1: T (fixed)
- Position 2: cannot be A
- Position 3: could be A or O or N
- Position 4: could be A or O or N
- Position 5: cannot be N

Let's list possible placements:
- A must be in position 3 or 4
- O must be in position 2 or 3 or 4 (but not 3 or 4 if A is there)
- N must be in position 2, 3, or 4

Let's try A in position 3:
- T _ A _ _
  - O must be in position 2 or 4
  - N must be in position 2, 4 (but not 5)
  - If O in 2 and N in 4: T O A N _
  - But N is in position 4, and we need a letter for position 5. Available letters (common): C, D, G, H, M, P, etc. Need to avoid R,S,E,L. Possible: T O A N D, T O A N C, etc. ""TONAD"" is not a word. ""TONIC"" has I (not yet tested), but we don't know if I is allowed. Let's see if ""TONIC"" is valid - yes, it is.

Check constraints for TONIC:
- Starts with T (✓)
- Contains A, O, N (A is in position 3, O in 2, N in 4)
- A is not in 1 or 2 (it's in 3) ✓
- O is not in 3 or 4 (it's in 2) ✓
- N is not in 5 (it's in 4) ✓
- No R, S, E, L ✓

This seems valid. Let's go with TONIC.

1. The word starts with T (position 1).
2. The word contains O (position 2).
3. The word contains N (position 3).
4. The word does NOT contain R, S, E, L, I, C.

So the pattern is: T O N _ _

Letters left to test (common unused consonants): D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that starts with TON and uses only the allowed letters.

Possible endings:

- TONED (invalid)
- TONAL (but L is banned)
- TONDO (but D and O are allowed, but O is already used)
- TONGA (A is allowed, G is allowed)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", etc. 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE uses S, L, A, T, E - covers common consonants and vowels
- CRANE uses C, R, A, N, E - similar
- AROSE uses A, R, O, S, E - very common letters

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S), giving me good coverage for identifying letters in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 1)
- R is NOT in the word
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 3)
- S is NOT in the word
- E is NOT in the word

So we know:
- The word contains A and O, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain R, S, or E.

To maximize information, the next guess should:
1. Include A and O in new positions.
2. Use other common letters that haven’t been tested yet (like T, N, L, C, etc.).
3. Avoid R, S, E.

A good candidate is ""TAOON"" (but that repeats O). Instead, let's try ""TAOIC"" - but that's not a common word. Better: ""TONAL"" - but it has L which is common. However, we already know E is out, but L hasn't been tested.

Another option: ""COAT"" is 4 letters. ""COATI"" is 5 letters but less common. 

A strong, common word that fits is ""TALON"":
- T, L, N are new letters.
- A is moved to position 2 (was position 1).
- O is moved to position 4 (was position 3).

This tests new consonants while placing known letters in new spots.

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

Round 1 (AROSE):

Round 2 (TALON):
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 1)
- A is in the word but not in position 2
- L is not in the word
- O is in the word but not in position 4
- N is in the word but not in position 5

What we now know:
- The word starts with T (position 1)
- It contains A, O, N (all still possible)
- It does NOT contain R, S, E, L
- A is not in position 1 or 2
- O is not in position 3 or 4
- N is not in position 5

We need a 5-letter word beginning with T, containing A, O, N, with A not in position 2, O not in 3 or 4, and N not in 5. Also avoiding R, S, E, L.

Possible positions:
- Position 1: T (fixed)
- Position 2: cannot be A
- Position 3: could be A or O or N
- Position 4: could be A or O or N
- Position 5: cannot be N

- O must be in position 2 or 3 or 4 (but not 3 or 4 if A is there)
- N must be in position 2, 3, or 4

Let's try A in position 3:
- T _ A _ _
  - O must be in position 2 or 4
  - N must be in position 2, 4 (but not 5)
  - If O in 2 and N in 4: T O A N _
  - But N is in position 4, and we need a letter for position 5. Available letters (common): C, D, G, H, M, P, etc. Need to avoid R,S,E,L.

From all feedback:

1. T is fixed in position 1.
2. O is fixed in position 2.
3. N is fixed in position 3.
4. Letters **not** in the word: R, S, E, L, I, C, D.

So the word is T O N _ _ and the last two letters must be chosen from the remaining unused common letters: A, B, F, G, H, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We already know A is in the word (from the first feedback: A(-) means A exists but is not in position 1). Since positions 1,2,3 are T,O,N, A must be in position 4 or 5.

Possible endings:
- TON_A: TONGA (G allowed)
- TON_A: TONHA (H allowed)
- TON_A: TONMA (M allowed)
- TON_A: TONPA (P allowed)
- TON_A: TONKA (K allowed)

Valid dictionary words: TONGA, TONKA, TONPA (not common), TONMA (not a word), TONHA (not a word).

Between TONGA and TONKA, both are valid. TONGA is more common in word lists, so I'll guess TONGA.

Check:
- TONGA: T(✓) O(✓) N(✓) G(?) A(?)
- G and A have never been tested; they are allowed.
- No banned letters appear.
