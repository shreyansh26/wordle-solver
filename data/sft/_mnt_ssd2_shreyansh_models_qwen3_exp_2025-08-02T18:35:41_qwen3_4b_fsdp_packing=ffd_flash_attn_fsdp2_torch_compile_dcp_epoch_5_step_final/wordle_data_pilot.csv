### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good starting word should include several of these. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This gives us a good spread to identify which vowels are in the word and their positions, as well as whether R or S are present. Other good options might be ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ADIEU"", but ""AROSE"" seems balanced and informative.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (it was 3rd, so it must be 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th).
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- The word contains O but not in position 3.
- The word does NOT contain A, R, S, or E.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Has O in a different position (not 3rd).
2. Avoids A, R, S, E entirely.
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Good remaining common consonants: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, H, etc.
Good remaining vowels: I, U (O is already known).

Let’s try a word that puts O in position 2 (since 1,4,5 are still open but 2 is common) and uses other common letters.  
""POINT"" comes to mind: P, O, I, N, T.  
- It has O in position 2 (different from position 3 in arose).  
- It avoids A, R, S, E.  
- Uses P, I, N, T which are all common and untested.

This should give us good information about P, I, N, T and confirm where O can go.

From the new feedback on “point”:

- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- T(✓) – T is in the word and in the correct fifth position.

So far we know:
1. Word starts with P and ends with T.
2. Contains O and I, but O cannot be 2nd and I cannot be 3rd.
3. Does NOT contain A, R, S, E, N.

Letters left to use: O, I, plus any other untested consonants (e.g., B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) and the remaining vowel U.

We need a 5-letter word with pattern P _ _ _ T, containing both O and I, with O not in position 2 and I not in position 3.

Possible placements:

- I can be 2nd, 4th, or 5th (but 5th is T, so 2nd or 4th).

Let’s try to place O and I in remaining spots:
- If O is 3rd, then I must be 2nd or 4th.
- If O is 4th, then I must be 2nd.

Let’s try O in 3rd and I in 2nd: P I O _ T. We need a letter for position 4. Possible consonants: common ones are C, D, L, M, etc. Let’s try “PILOT”:

- Check if PILOT uses allowed letters: P, I, O, L, T – all allowed so far.
- Check positions: O is 3rd (allowed), I is 2nd (allowed).

This seems valid.
