### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like R, T, N, S, L. 

Popular first guesses include:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - heavy on vowels)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of common letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is not in the word (x)
- A is in the word and in the correct position (✓) → A is the 2nd letter
- I is not in the word (x)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-) → E appears somewhere else

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ A _ _ _
- Contains E somewhere except the 5th position
- Does NOT contain R, I, or S

Good letters to test next: common consonants not yet ruled out (T, N, L, C, D, M, etc.) and vowels O, U.

A strong second guess should test new common letters while respecting the constraints. ""TALON"" is a good candidate:
- T: common consonant
- A: already confirmed in 2nd position
- L: common consonant
- O: common vowel
- N: common consonant

This tests T, L, O, N while keeping A in place and avoiding ruled-out letters (R, I, S).
