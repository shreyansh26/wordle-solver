### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common)
- O (common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives me a good chance to identify multiple correct letters or their positions early on, which will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A or S
- Contains R, O, E, but not in positions 2, 3, or 5 respectively
- We need a 5-letter word that uses R, O, E and avoids A and S

Looking at the letters we know are in the word: R, O, E
Possible positions:
- R cannot be in position 2
- O cannot be in position 3
- E cannot be in position 5

Let’s try to construct a word that places these letters in new positions while introducing new common letters (T, N, L, etc.) to test more letters.

A good candidate is ""TROPE"":
- T is a new letter to test
- R is now in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2, so this would be wrong placement - we need to avoid R in position 2)
- O is in position 3 (but feedback said O is not in position 3 - so this is also wrong placement)
- P is a new letter
- E is in position 5 (but feedback said E is not in position 5 - so this is also wrong placement)

This is bad because it repeats wrong positions for R, O, E.

Another candidate: ""ORENT"" - but this isn't a valid word.

Let’s try ""TREND"":
- T is new
- R is in position 2 (forbidden by feedback)
- E is in position 3 (allowed)
- N is new
- D is new

Still, R is in position 2 which is forbidden.

Try ""ENTRY"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- N new
- T new
- R in position 4 (allowed)
- Y new

This looks good:
- Contains E, R (both allowed positions)
- Introduces N, T, Y to test new letters
- Avoids A and S
- All letters are in new positions relative to the feedback

A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common)
- O (common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives me a good chance to identify multiple correct letters or their positions early on, which will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A or S
- Contains R, O, E, but not in positions 2, 3, or 5 respectively
- We need a 5-letter word that uses R, O, E and avoids A and S

Looking at the letters we know are in the word: R, O, E
Possible positions:
- R cannot be in position 2
- O cannot be in position 3
- E cannot be in position 5

Let’s try to construct a word that places these letters in new positions while introducing new common letters (T, N, L, etc.) to test more letters.

A good candidate is ""TROPE"":
- T is a new letter to test
- R is now in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2, so this would be wrong placement - we need to avoid R in position 2)
- O is in position 3 (but feedback said O is not in position 3 - so this is also wrong placement)
- P is a new letter
- E is in position 5 (but feedback said E is not in position 5 - so this is also wrong placement)

This is bad because it repeats wrong positions for R, O, E.

Another candidate: ""ORENT"" - but this isn't a valid word.

Let’s try ""TREND"":
- T is new
- R is in position 2 (forbidden by feedback)
- E is in position 3 (allowed)
- N is new
- D is new

Still, R is in position 2 which is forbidden.

Try ""ENTRY"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- N new
- T new
- R in position 4 (allowed)
- Y new

This looks good:
- Contains E, R (both allowed positions)
- Introduces N, T, Y to test new letters
- Avoids A and S
- All letters are in new positions relative to the feedback

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   - A and S are NOT in the word.
   - R, O, E are in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively.

2. ENTRY → E(-) N(x) T(x) R(-) Y(x)
   - N, T, Y are NOT in the word.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, S, N, T, Y
- Letters definitely in the word: R, O, E
- Forbidden positions:
  – R cannot be in positions 2 or 4
  – O cannot be in position 3
  – E cannot be in positions 1 or 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses R, O, E
- Avoids A, S, N, T, Y
- Places R, O, E in allowed positions

Let’s list possible positions for each letter:
- R: allowed in 1, 3, 5
- O: allowed in 1, 2, 4, 5
- E: allowed in 2, 3, 4

We also need two more distinct letters from the remaining unused common letters (D, I, L, C, etc.).

Let’s try to construct a word:
- If we place R in position 1: R _ _ _ _
  – Then O and E must go in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 but avoiding forbidden spots.
  – Let’s try R O E _ _ : but E cannot be in position 3 if O is in 2 (no conflict). However, we need two more letters.
  – A valid word: R O E _ _ → “ROE??” – no common word.
  
- If we place R in position 3: _ _ R _ _
  – Then O and E must go in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 but avoiding forbidden spots.
  – Let’s try O R E _ _ : but R is in 3, so O in 1, E in 3 conflicts with R in 3.
  – Try O _ R E _ : positions O(1), R(3), E(4) – all allowed. Need two more letters.
  – A valid word: “ORIEL” – but Y is forbidden.
  
- If we place R in position 5: _ _ _ _ R
  – Then O and E must go in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 but avoiding forbidden spots.
  – Let’s try O _ E _ R : positions O(1), E(3), R(5) – all allowed. Need two more letters.
  – A valid word: “OBEAR” – but A is forbidden.
  – “OCELR” – not a word.
  – “OILER” – I and L are allowed, but E is in 3 (allowed), R in 5 (allowed). This seems valid.

“OILER”:
- Letters: O, I, L, E, R
- Contains R, O, E
- Avoids A, S, N, T, Y
- R is in position 5 (allowed)
- O is in position 1 (allowed)
- E is in position 4 (allowed)
- I and L are new letters to test

- Letters NOT in the word: A, S, N, T, Y, I, L
- Letters still allowed to appear: D, C, G, B, M, F, H, K, P, U, V, W, X, Z (but we need only 5 letters total, so most of these are unlikely)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 4

- Contains O somewhere NOT in position 1
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

Let's try:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- A (very common)
- R (common)
- O (common)
- S (very common)
- E (most common letter in English)

This combination gives me a good chance to identify multiple correct letters or their positions early on, which will help narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- S is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Does NOT contain A or S
- Contains R, O, E, but not in positions 2, 3, or 5 respectively
- We need a 5-letter word that uses R, O, E and avoids A and S

Looking at the letters we know are in the word: R, O, E
Possible positions:
- R cannot be in position 2
- O cannot be in position 3
- E cannot be in position 5

Let’s try to construct a word that places these letters in new positions while introducing new common letters (T, N, L, etc.) to test more letters.

A good candidate is ""TROPE"":
- T is a new letter to test
- R is now in position 2 (but feedback said R is not in position 2, so this would be wrong placement - we need to avoid R in position 2)
- O is in position 3 (but feedback said O is not in position 3 - so this is also wrong placement)
- P is a new letter
- E is in position 5 (but feedback said E is not in position 5 - so this is also wrong placement)

This is bad because it repeats wrong positions for R, O, E.

Another candidate: ""ORENT"" - but this isn't a valid word.

Let’s try ""TREND"":
- T is new
- R is in position 2 (forbidden by feedback)
- E is in position 3 (allowed)
- N is new
- D is new

Still, R is in position 2 which is forbidden.

Try ""ENTRY"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- N new
- T new
- R in position 4 (allowed)
- Y new

This looks good:
- Contains E, R (both allowed positions)
- Introduces N, T, Y to test new letters
- Avoids A and S
- All letters are in new positions relative to the feedback

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ENTRY -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(x) T(x) R(-) Y(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
   - A and S are NOT in the word.
   - R, O, E are in the word but NOT in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively.

2. ENTRY → E(-) N(x) T(x) R(-) Y(x)
   - N, T, Y are NOT in the word.
   - E is in the word but NOT in position 1.
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 4.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, S, N, T, Y
- Letters definitely in the word: R, O, E
- Forbidden positions:
  – R cannot be in positions 2 or 4
  – O cannot be in position 3
  – E cannot be in positions 1 or 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Uses R, O, E
- Avoids A, S, N, T, Y
- Places R, O, E in allowed positions

Let’s list possible positions for each letter:
- R: allowed in 1, 3, 5
- O: allowed in 1, 2, 4, 5
- E: allowed in 2, 3, 4

We also need two more distinct letters from the remaining unused common letters (D, I, L, C, etc.).

Let’s try to construct a word:
- If we place R in position 1: R _ _ _ _
  – Then O and E must go in positions 2, 3, 4, 5 but avoiding forbidden spots.
  – Let’s try R O E _ _ : but E cannot be in position 3 if O is in 2 (no conflict). However, we need two more letters.
  – A valid word: R O E _ _ → “ROE??” – no common word.
  
- If we place R in position 3: _ _ R _ _
  – Then O and E must go in positions 1, 2, 4, 5 but avoiding forbidden spots.
  – Let’s try O R E _ _ : but R is in 3, so O in 1, E in 3 conflicts with R in 3.
  – Try O _ R E _ : positions O(1), R(3), E(4) – all allowed. Need two more letters.
  – A valid word: “ORIEL” – but Y is forbidden.
  
- If we place R in position 5: _ _ _ _ R
  – Then O and E must go in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 but avoiding forbidden spots.
  – Let’s try O _ E _ R : positions O(1), E(3), R(5) – all allowed. Need two more letters.
  – A valid word: “OBEAR” – but A is forbidden.
  – “OCELR” – not a word.
  – “OILER” – I and L are allowed, but E is in 3 (allowed), R in 5 (allowed). This seems valid.

“OILER”:
- Letters: O, I, L, E, R
- Contains R, O, E
- Avoids A, S, N, T, Y
- R is in position 5 (allowed)
- O is in position 1 (allowed)
- E is in position 4 (allowed)
- I and L are new letters to test

Guess 3: OILER -> FEEDBACK: O(-) I(x) L(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on OILER:
- O(-) → O is in the word but NOT in position 1
- I(x) → I is NOT in the word
- L(x) → L is NOT in the word
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in position 4
- R(✓) → R is in the word AND in position 5

So we now know:
- Letters in the word: O, E, R (with E in position 4, R in position 5)
- Letters NOT in the word: A, S, N, T, Y, I, L
- Letters still allowed to appear: D, C, G, B, M, F, H, K, P, U, V, W, X, Z (but we need only 5 letters total, so most of these are unlikely)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 4
- Has R in position 5
- Contains O somewhere NOT in position 1
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out

So the word must look like: _ _ _ E R
And must contain O in position 2 or 3 (since it can't be in 1, 4, or 5).

Let's try:
- If O is in position 2: _ O _ E R
  Need two more letters in positions 1 and 3, from allowed letters.
  Allowed letters: D, C, G, B, M, F, H, K, P, U, V, W, etc.
  Try C in position 1 and O in 2: C O _ E R → need a letter for position 3.
  COBER? Not a word.
  COMER? M is allowed, O is in 2, E in 4, R in 5. COMER is a valid word.
  Check letters: C, O, M, E, R
  - C: not ruled out
  - O: allowed in position 2 (since previous O was in 1 and now in 2)
  - M: not ruled out
  - E: correct position
  - R: correct position
  All letters are allowed.

COMER seems like a good next guess.

So we still have the pattern _ O _ E R and the following letters NOT in the word:
A, S, N, T, Y, I, L, C, M, F, G

Remaining possible letters for positions 1 and 3:
D, B, H, K, P, U, V, W, etc.

- D O P E R → DOPER (valid word)
- H O B E R → HOBER (not a word)
