### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. 

The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (very common ending letter)
- E (most common letter overall)

This combination gives me good coverage of common letters and positions, which should provide useful feedback for narrowing down possibilities in subsequent guesses.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S: not in the word (x)
- L: in the word but wrong position (-)
- A: in the word but wrong position (-)
- T: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
- The word contains L, A, E, but not S or T.
- L, A, E are each in the word but not in the positions they occupied in SLATE (positions 2,3,5 respectively).

I need a new 5-letter word that:
- Uses L, A, E (each in a different position from SLATE)
- Does not use S or T
- Uses two new letters

Let me think of words that fit these constraints. One good candidate is ""LEARN"":
- L moves from position 2 to 1
- E moves from position 5 to 2
- A moves from position 3 to 3 (but this is the same position as before, which is bad - we need A to move)
So ""LEARN"" is invalid because A stays in position 3.

Another candidate is ""EARLY"":
- E moves from 5 to 1
- A moves from 3 to 2
- R is new
- L moves from 2 to 4
- Y is new
This satisfies all constraints: contains L, A, E in new positions, no S or T, and introduces two new letters (R and Y).

Letters that are NOT in the word: S, T  

Positions ruled out so far:
- L cannot be in positions 2 or 4  
- A cannot be in position 2  
- E cannot be in positions 1 or 5  
- R cannot be in position 3  

We need a 5-letter word that uses exactly these five letters (L, A, E, R, Y) and places them in positions that satisfy the above constraints. The only remaining position for Y is 5 (already satisfied).  

Let’s list valid placements:

- Y must be in position 5  
- L must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (but 5 is taken by Y), so 1 or 3  
- A must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (5 taken), so 1, 3, or 4  
- E must be in positions 2, 3, or 4  
- R must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (5 taken), so 1, 2, or 4  

Let’s try to build a word:

Option 1: L in position 1  
Then we have: L _ _ _ Y  
Now place A, E, R in positions 2,3,4 with constraints:
- A not in 2 → can be 3 or 4  
- E not in 1 or 5 → can be 2,3,4  
- R not in 3 → can be 2 or 4  

Possible permutations:
- A in 3, E in 2, R in 4 → L E A R Y → ""LEARY"" (valid word)  
- A in 3, E in 4, R in 2 → L R A E Y → ""LRAEY"" (invalid, not a word)  
- A in 4, E in 2, R in 3 → but R cannot be in 3 → invalid  
- A in 4, E in 3, R in 2 → L R E A Y → ""LREAY"" (invalid)  

Only valid word: ""LEARY""  

Option 2: L in position 3  
Then we have: _ _ L _ Y  
Now place A, E, R in positions 1,2,4 with constraints:
- A not in 2 → can be 1 or 4  
- E not in 1 or 5 → can be 2 or 4  
- R not in 3 (already 3 is L) → can be 1,2,4  

Possible permutations:
- A in 1, E in 2, R in 4 → A E L R Y → ""AELRY"" (invalid)  
- A in 1, E in 4, R in 2 → A R L E Y → ""ARLEY"" (valid word)  
- A in 4, E in 2, R in 1 → R E L A Y → ""RELAY"" (valid word)  

So we have two more valid words: ""ARLEY"" and ""RELAY"".
