### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which aren't. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English. One such word is ""SLATE"" because it contains:
- S: Very common starting letter
- L: Common consonant
- A: Common vowel
- T: Very common letter
- E: Most common letter in English

This combination should give me good coverage to start narrowing down possibilities.

A good candidate is ""CRANE"":
- C, R, N are common consonants
- A is in position 2 (allowed since A can’t be in 3)
- E is in position 5 (allowed since E can’t be in 5? Wait, no: E was marked “-” in position 5, meaning E is in the word but NOT in position 5. So CRANE’s E in position 5 would be invalid.)

Let’s try “CRAVE” instead:
- C, R, V are common

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
S, L, T, C, V

Letters that ARE in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown:

Specific positional exclusions so far:

- E cannot be in position 5 (from SLATE) and also cannot be in position 5 (from CRAVE) – still no new info.
- R cannot be in position 2 (from CRAVE).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains R, A, E exactly once each
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, C, V
- Uses only remaining common letters to maximize information

Remaining common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, N, P, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: I, O, U (but we already have A and E)

A good candidate is “BREAD”:

- Contains R, A, E
- No forbidden letters (S,L,T,C,V)
- R is in position 2 (allowed, since R was only excluded from position 2 in CRAVE, but CRAVE had R in position 2 and got “-”, so R cannot be in position 2 at all. Wait: in CRAVE, R was in position 2 and got “-”, meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. So R must be in 1,3,4, or 5.)

From the feedback so far:

Letters that are NOT in the word at all:
S, L, T, C, V, M, G

Letters that ARE in the word and whose positions are now known:
- A is in position 2 (✓ in MARGE)
- R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from CRAVE and MARGE)
- E is in the word but NOT in positions 4 or 5 (from SLATE and MARGE)

So the secret word has the pattern:
_ A _ _ _ with remaining letters chosen from {B, D, F, H, I, J, K, N, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z} and must include R and E.

R can be in positions 1, 4, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 3).
E can be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (cannot be 4 or 5), but position 2 is already A, so E must be in position 1 or 3.

Let’s consider the two cases:

Case 1: E in position 1
Word pattern: E A _ _ _
R must be in position 4 or 5.
Possible words: E A R _ _ or E A _ R _
We need two more letters from the allowed set (no forbidden letters).
Example: E A R N D → ""EARDY"" is invalid (Y is allowed, but D is allowed). Actually, ""EARLY"" is invalid (L is forbidden). ""EARNS"" is invalid (S is forbidden). ""EARED"" is invalid (D is allowed, but double E is possible, but we don't know if E is allowed twice). Let's try ""EARED"" - but we don't know if E is allowed twice. Maybe ""EATER"" - T is forbidden. ""EAGRE"" - G is forbidden. ""EAFRE"" - not a word. 

Case 2: E in position 3
Word pattern: _ A E _ _
R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
Possible patterns:
R A E _ _  (R in 1)
_ A E R _  (R in 4)
_ A E _ R  (R in 5)

Let's try R A E _ _:
Need two more letters from allowed set. ""RAEON"" - not a word. ""RAEID"" - not a word. ""RAEUM"" - M is forbidden. 

Next pattern: _ A E R _
Need first and fifth letters from allowed set. ""BAKER"" - K is allowed, B is allowed. Check letters: B, A, E, R, K. All allowed. ""BAKER"" is a valid word.

Next pattern: _ A E _ R
Need first and fourth letters. ""FAKER"" - F is allowed, K is allowed. Check letters: F, A, E, K, R. All allowed. ""FAKER"" is valid.

Between ""BAKER"" and ""FAKER"", both are valid. Let's pick ""BAKER"" first.
