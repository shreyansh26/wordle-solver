For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters in English. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C are among the most common. 

A strong opening word is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeating letters. This gives me the best chance to gather information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R, O, S are not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S.
- Letters in the word but misplaced: A, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain R, O, or S.

Good candidates would use remaining common letters like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc. Let’s try a word that shifts A and E to new positions and introduces new common letters. “LEANT” uses A (not in position 1) and E (not in position 5), and introduces L, N, T. Let’s check:
- L, N, T are new letters.
- A is now in position 2 (was position 1).
- E is now in position 4 (was position 5).

This seems like a strong second guess to maximize information gain.

Summary of what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (x):

Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions (-):
- A (was position 1 in AROSE, position 3 in LEANT)
- E (was position 5 in AROSE, position 2 in LEANT)

Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct position (✓):
- L (position 1)

So the word starts with L, contains both A and E somewhere else, and does NOT contain R, O, S, N, T.

Remaining common letters we can try: D, C, M, P, U, I, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with L, containing A and E (not in positions 3 or 2 respectively), and avoiding the excluded letters.

Possible structure: L _ _ _ _

A must be in position 2, 4 or 5 (but not 3).
E must be in position 3, 4 or 5 (but not 2).

Let’s try placing A in position 2 and E in position 4: L A _ E _

We need a letter for position 3 that’s allowed (not excluded). Common choices: C, D, M, P, U, I, Y.

“LACED” uses C and D, both allowed, and fits: L A C E D.
- A is in position 2 (was wrong in 1 and 3, now correct position 2)
- E is in position 4 (was wrong in 2 and 5, now correct position 4)
- C and D are new letters.
- No excluded letters used.

“LAMEY” is a valid word (variant spelling of “lame” or slang for “lamey”), but let’s check if there are better common words.

Another possibility: L A M E D – but D is excluded.

L A P E R – R excluded.

L A G E R – R excluded.

L A M E N – N excluded.

L A P E D – D excluded.

L A M E Y – seems the only valid word left.

L A M E D – D excluded.

L A M E R – R excluded.

L A M E Y – valid.

Another possibility: L A P E D – D excluded.

L A B E L – L already used.

L A P E R – R excluded.

L A M E R – R excluded.

However, to maximize common letters, let’s consider another approach: maybe position 3 and 5 can be filled with other allowed letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters in English. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C are among the most common. 

A strong opening word is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeating letters. This gives me the best chance to gather information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R, O, S are not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S.
- Letters in the word but misplaced: A, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain R, O, or S.

Good candidates would use remaining common letters like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc. Let’s try a word that shifts A and E to new positions and introduces new common letters. “LEANT” uses A (not in position 1) and E (not in position 5), and introduces L, N, T. Let’s check:
- L, N, T are new letters.
- A is now in position 2 (was position 1).
- E is now in position 4 (was position 5).

This seems like a strong second guess to maximize information gain.

<|im_end|>

Summary of what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (x):
- R, O, S, N, T

Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions (-):
- A (was position 1 in AROSE, position 3 in LEANT)
- E (was position 5 in AROSE, position 2 in LEANT)

Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct position (✓):
- L (position 1)

So the word starts with L, contains both A and E somewhere else, and does NOT contain R, O, S, N, T.

Remaining common letters we can try: D, C, M, P, U, I, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with L, containing A and E (not in positions 3 or 2 respectively), and avoiding the excluded letters.

Possible structure: L _ _ _ _

A must be in position 2, 4 or 5 (but not 3).
E must be in position 3, 4 or 5 (but not 2).

Let’s try placing A in position 2 and E in position 4: L A _ E _

We need a letter for position 3 that’s allowed (not excluded). Common choices: C, D, M, P, U, I, Y.

“LACED” uses C and D, both allowed, and fits: L A C E D.
- A is in position 2 (was wrong in 1 and 3, now correct position 2)
- E is in position 4 (was wrong in 2 and 5, now correct position 4)
- C and D are new letters.
- No excluded letters used.

This seems like a good third guess.

Current confirmed information:
- Word pattern: L A _ E _
- Letters already ruled out for positions 3 and 5: C, D, M, Y
- Excluded letters overall: R, O, S, N, T, C, D, M, Y
- Remaining common letters for positions 3 and 5: B, F, G, H, I, K, P, U, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with LA, ending with E, and with a single letter in between, using only allowed letters.

Possible patterns: L A ? E ?

Looking at remaining letters:
- Position 3: B, F, G, H, I, K, P, U
- Position 5: must be a letter not yet excluded and forming a valid word

Let's list possible combinations:

1. L A B E _ – no common 5-letter word ends with _ here.
2. L A F E _ – no common word.
3. L A G E _ – L A G E N (N excluded), L A G E R (R excluded)
4. L A H E _ – no common word.
5. L A I E _ – no common word.
6. L A K E _ – L A K E Y (Y excluded), L A K E D (D excluded), L A K E N (N excluded)
7. L A P E _ – L A P E D (D excluded), L A P E R (R excluded)
8. L A U E _ – no common word.
9. L A W E _ – no common word.

The only remaining valid word that fits is L A P E R, but R is excluded. Next possibility is L A G E N, but N is excluded. 

Looking again, we missed L A P E D (D excluded) and L A G E R (R excluded). 

Another candidate: L A B E L – but L is already used in position 1 and can't repeat in position 5. 

Wait, let's re-examine allowed letters more carefully. We have:

Excluded letters: R, O, S, N, T, C, D, M, Y

Remaining letters: A, B, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

But A and E are already fixed in positions 2 and 4. L is fixed in position 1. So positions 3 and 5 must be from the remaining list excluding the above.

Valid letters left: B, F, G, H, I, K, P, U, W, etc.

Possible words:
- L A G E N – N excluded
- L A P E R – R excluded
- L A K E Y – Y excluded
- L A B E L – L already used in position 1, and would repeat in position 5 (but word can have repeated letters, but we have no info about L in position 5. However, we have L in position 1 confirmed, but nothing about position 5. However, ""LABLE"" is not a word.

Actually, let's think differently: the word could have repeated letters. The pattern is L A _ E _. We need a valid word.

Looking at valid English words:
- L A G E N – N excluded
- L A P E R – R excluded
- L A K E Y – Y excluded
- L A B E L – valid word, but would have L in position 5. Is L allowed in position 5? We have no info against it. Let's check if LABLE is a word. Actually, it's ""LABEL"".

""LABEL"" fits:
- L A B E L
- Letters used: L, A, B, E, L
- Excluded letters: none of B, L are excluded (L in position 5 is allowed since only position 1 is confirmed for L).
- This seems valid.

But we have to check if any letters are excluded. B is allowed, L is allowed, A and E are confirmed. So ""LABEL"" is possible.

But let's verify if there's any other. Another possibility is L A P E D, but D is excluded.

Thus, ""LABEL"" seems to be the only valid word left that fits all constraints.

But wait, let me check again. Is there L A P E D? D is excluded.

Another candidate: L A G E R – R excluded.

L A B E L – valid word.

Therefore, the next guess is LABEL.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm many possibilities. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring letters in English. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C are among the most common. 

A strong opening word is ""AROSE"" because it contains five very common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no repeating letters. This gives me the best chance to gather information about which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).
- R, O, S are not in the word at all (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: R, O, S.
- Letters in the word but misplaced: A, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and E (but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively).
- Does NOT contain R, O, or S.

Good candidates would use remaining common letters like T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc. Let’s try a word that shifts A and E to new positions and introduces new common letters. “LEANT” uses A (not in position 1) and E (not in position 5), and introduces L, N, T. Let’s check:
- L, N, T are new letters.
- A is now in position 2 (was position 1).
- E is now in position 4 (was position 5).

This seems like a strong second guess to maximize information gain.

Summary of what we now know:

Letters NOT in the word (x):
- R, O, S, N, T

Letters that ARE in the word but in wrong positions (-):
- A (was position 1 in AROSE, position 3 in LEANT)
- E (was position 5 in AROSE, position 2 in LEANT)

Letters that ARE in the word and in the correct position (✓):
- L (position 1)

So the word starts with L, contains both A and E somewhere else, and does NOT contain R, O, S, N, T.

Remaining common letters we can try: D, C, M, P, U, I, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word starting with L, containing A and E (not in positions 3 or 2 respectively), and avoiding the excluded letters.

Possible structure: L _ _ _ _

A must be in position 2, 4 or 5 (but not 3).
E must be in position 3, 4 or 5 (but not 2).

Let’s try placing A in position 2 and E in position 4: L A _ E _

We need a letter for position 3 that’s allowed (not excluded). Common choices: C, D, M, P, U, I, Y.

“LACED” uses C and D, both allowed, and fits: L A C E D.
- A is in position 2 (was wrong in 1 and 3, now correct position 2)
- E is in position 4 (was wrong in 2 and 5, now correct position 4)
- C and D are new letters.
- No excluded letters used.

This seems like a good third guess.

- Remaining positions: 3 and 5
- Remaining allowed letters (common ones): B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need two distinct letters for positions 3 and 5, neither of which is excluded. Common combinations that make valid words:

- Position 3: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U
- Position 5: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, Y, etc.

Looking for real 5-letter words fitting L A _ E _:

- L A M E Y – “lamey” (valid, though uncommon)
- L A P E D – but D is excluded
- L A G E R – but R is excluded
- L A M E D – D excluded
- L A G E N – N excluded
- L A G E R – R excluded
- L A B E L – L already used in position 1
- L A M E Y – valid, uses Y
- L A P E D – D excluded
- L A P E R – R excluded
- L A M E R – R excluded
- L A P E R – R excluded
- L A M E Y – seems the only valid option left

“LAMEY” is a valid word (variant spelling of “lame” or slang for “lamey”), but let’s check if there are better common words.

Another possibility: L A M E D – but D is excluded.

L A P E R – R excluded.

L A G E R – R excluded.

L A M E N – N excluded.

L A P E D – D excluded.

L A M E Y – seems the only valid word left.

But let’s think again: maybe we missed something. Are there other words?

L A M E D – D excluded.

L A M E R – R excluded.

L A M E Y – valid.

Another possibility: L A P E D – D excluded.

L A G E N – N excluded.

L A B E L – L already used.

L A P E R – R excluded.

L A M E R – R excluded.

L A P E D – D excluded.

L A M E Y – valid.

Thus, the only valid word fitting the pattern with allowed letters is “LAMEY”.

But let’s verify if there are any other common words.

Another candidate: L A M E Y is valid.

Another possibility: L A M E D – D excluded.

L A M E R – R excluded.

L A M E Y – valid.

So, the next logical guess is L A M E Y.

But let me double-check: is “LAMEY” a recognized 5-letter word? Yes, it is an informal variant of “lame” or slang for “lamey”.

However, to maximize common letters, let’s consider another approach: maybe position 3 and 5 can be filled with other allowed letters.

Looking at remaining allowed letters: B, F, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, Y.

Possible combinations:

- L A B E _ – but we need a 5-letter word: L A B E _ – no common word ends here.
- L A F E _ – no common word.
- L A G E _ – L A G E N – N excluded.
- L A H E _ – no common word.
- L A I E _ – no common word.
- L A K E _ – L A K E Y – “lakey” (valid, but uncommon)
- L A M E _ – L A M E D – D excluded, L A M E R – R excluded
- L A P E _ – L A P E D – D excluded
- L A U E _ – no common word
- L A Y E _ – no common word

Thus, the only valid words left are:

- L A M E Y
- L A K E Y

Between these, “LAMEY” is more common.

Therefore, the next guess is L A M E Y.

Possible patterns: L A ? E ?

Looking at remaining letters:
- Position 3: B, F, G, H, I, K, P, U
- Position 5: must be a letter not yet excluded and forming a valid word

8. L A U E _ – no common word.
9. L A W E _ – no common word.

The only remaining valid word that fits is L A P E R, but R is excluded. Next possibility is L A G E N, but N is excluded. 

Looking again, we missed L A P E D (D excluded) and L A G E R (R excluded). 

Another candidate: L A B E L – but L is already used in position 1 and can't repeat in position 5. 

Wait, let's re-examine allowed letters more carefully. We have:

Excluded letters: R, O, S, N, T, C, D, M, Y

Remaining letters: A, B, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

But A and E are already fixed in positions 2 and 4. L is fixed in position 1. So positions 3 and 5 must be from the remaining list excluding the above.

Valid letters left: B, F, G, H, I, K, P, U, W, etc.

Possible words:
- L A G E N – N excluded
- L A P E R – R excluded
- L A K E Y – Y excluded
- L A B E L – L already used in position 1, and would repeat in position 5 (but word can have repeated letters, but we have no info about L in position 5. However, we have L in position 1 confirmed, but nothing about position 5. However, ""LABLE"" is not a word.

Actually, let's think differently: the word could have repeated letters. The pattern is L A _ E _. We need a valid word.

Looking at valid English words:

- L A B E L – valid word, but would have L in position 5. Is L allowed in position 5? We have no info against it. Let's check if LABLE is a word. Actually, it's ""LABEL"".

""LABEL"" fits:
- L A B E L
- Letters used: L, A, B, E, L
- Excluded letters: none of B, L are excluded (L in position 5 is allowed since only position 1 is confirmed for L).
- This seems valid.

But we have to check if any letters are excluded. B is allowed, L is allowed, A and E are confirmed. So ""LABEL"" is possible.

But wait, let me check again. Is there L A P E D? D is excluded.

We now have:

- Word pattern: L A _ E L
- Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, N, T, C, D, M, Y, B
- Excluded letters overall: R, O, S, N, T, C, D, M, Y, B
- Remaining possible letters for position 3: F, G, H, I, K, P, U, W, etc.

We need a 5-letter word of the form L A ? E L where the middle letter is not any of the excluded ones.

Looking at valid English words:
- L A F E L – not a word
- L A G E L – not a word
- L A H E L – not a word
- L A I E L – not a word
- L A K E L – not a word
- L A P E L – not a word
- L A U E L – not a word
- L A W E L – not a word

However, ""LAGEL"" is not a valid word. The only valid word that fits is ""L A P E L"" but that's not in the dictionary. 

Wait, let me think of actual words ending with EL. The only common word that fits L A _ E L is ""LAPEL"" (the edge of a jacket). Checking ""LAPEL"":
- Letters: L, A, P, E, L
- P has not been excluded
- This fits all constraints.

Therefore, the next logical guess is LAPEL.
