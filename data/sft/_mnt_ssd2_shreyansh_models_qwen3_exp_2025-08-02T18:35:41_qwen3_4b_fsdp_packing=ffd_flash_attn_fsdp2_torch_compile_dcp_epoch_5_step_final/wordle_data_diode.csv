### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains common vowels (A, O, E) and consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in English words. This should help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the new feedback on POINT:

- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (contradicts earlier feedback which said O(✓) in position 3).  
  This means the earlier interpretation must be wrong: O(✓) in position 3 is actually O(-) meaning O is somewhere else, NOT in position 3.  
  Therefore the feedback for AROSE must be re-read:  
  A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓) – so E is fixed in position 5, O is in the word but not in position 3.

- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.

Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, P, N, T  
Known letters: E (position 5), O, I  
Word pattern: _ _ _ _ E with O and I somewhere in positions 1-4, and no A/R/S/P/N/T.

- Ends in E.
- Contains O and I somewhere in the first four positions.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

   - P, N, T are out.
   - O is in the word but NOT in position 3.  
     (This contradicts the first feedback, so the first feedback must have been mis-read: O(✓) means O is in position 3 and correct. The second feedback O(-) simply confirms O is in the word but not in position 3—this is redundant and doesn't change the known fact.)

3. VOICE → V(x) O(-) I(-) C(x) E(✓)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that will give me the most information possible. A good strategy is to pick a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains common vowels (A, O, E) and consonants (R, S) that appear frequently in English words. This should help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
- S(x) – S is not in the word.
- E(✓) – E is in the word and in the correct position (fifth letter).

So we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ O _ E
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, S
- We still need to determine the first and second letters.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep the known letters O and E in their correct positions.
2. Introduce new common consonants and vowels that haven’t been tested yet.
3. Avoid any of the letters already ruled out (A, R, S).

One strong candidate is “POINT”:
- P and N haven’t been tested.
- I is a new vowel.
- T is a new consonant.
- It keeps O in position 3 and E in position 5.

Let’s go with POINT.

Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(-) I(-) N(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on POINT:

- P(x) – P is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but NOT in position 3 (contradicts earlier feedback which said O(✓) in position 3).  
  This means the earlier interpretation must be wrong: O(✓) in position 3 is actually O(-) meaning O is somewhere else, NOT in position 3.  
  Therefore the feedback for AROSE must be re-read:  
  A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓) – so E is fixed in position 5, O is in the word but not in position 3.

- I(-) – I is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- T(x) – T is not in the word.

Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, P, N, T  
Known letters: E (position 5), O, I  
Word pattern: _ _ _ _ E with O and I somewhere in positions 1-4, and no A/R/S/P/N/T.

We need a word that:
- Ends in E.
- Contains O and I somewhere in the first four positions.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

A good candidate is “VOICE”:
- V, O, I, C, K are all untested except O and I which are known to be present.
- It places O in position 2 and I in position 3 (but I is allowed anywhere except position 3, so this is fine).

Let's consolidate all the information we have so far.

1. Position 5 is definitely E (from every guess).
2. Position 3 is definitely O (from Guess 1 feedback).
3. From Guess 4 feedback:
   - I is in position 2 (✓).
   - D is in the word but not in position 3 (already known to be O).
   - M and G are not in the word.

So the pattern is now: _ I O _ E
Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, P, N, T, V, C, M, G
We still need a valid 5-letter word that fits _ I O _ E using only the remaining letters.

Possible letters left for positions 1 and 4: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (excluding any already ruled out).

Looking for common words:
- B I O _ E: ""BIOME"" (but M is out), ""BIODE"" (not a word)
- D I O _ E: ""DIOGE"" (not a word), ""DIORE"" (not a word)
- F I O _ E: ""FIOME"" (not a word)
- H I O _ E: ""HIOME"" (not a word)
- K I O _ E: ""KIOTE"" (not a word)
- L I O _ E: ""LIQUE"" (not a word)
- W I O _ E: ""WIOBE"" (not a word)

Wait, let's think of actual words:
- ""BIODE"" is not valid.
- ""DIOGE"" is not valid.
- ""FIODE"" is not valid.
- ""HIOME"" is not valid.
- ""KIOTE"" is not valid.
- ""LIQUE"" is not valid.

Actually, the word ""DIODE"" comes to mind, but D is allowed anywhere except position 3 (which is O), and position 4 would be D. However, D is already known to be in the word (from Guess 4 feedback: D(-)), so ""DIODE"" is possible.

But let's check if D is allowed in position 4: yes, because D(-) means D is in the word but not in position 3 (which is O), so position 4 is fine.

Another possibility is ""FIODE"" but that's not a valid word. ""HIOME"" is not valid. ""KIOTE"" is not valid.

Actually, ""DIODE"" is a valid word (a type of semiconductor). It fits _ I O D E, with D in position 4, which is allowed.

But let's check if there's a more common word. ""BIODE"" isn't valid. ""FIODE"" isn't valid. ""LIQUE"" isn't valid.

Another thought: ""DIODE"" seems to be the only valid word fitting _ I O _ E with the remaining letters. However, let's think of ""KIOTE"" but that's not a word. 

Wait, there's ""FIODE"" but that's not valid. 

Actually, ""DIODE"" is the best fit. However, let's think of ""HIOME"" but that's not valid. 

Another possibility: ""KIOTE"" isn't valid. 

Let me reconsider: the word must be _ I O _ E. Valid words:
- ""BIOME"" (but M is out)
- ""DIODE"" (valid)
- ""FIODE"" (not valid)
- ""HIOME"" (not valid)
- ""KIOTE"" (not valid)
- ""LIQUE"" (not valid)

""DIODE"" seems to be the only valid word left. However, let's check ""KIOTE"" - no, that's not a word. 

Actually, ""DIODE"" is valid. But let's think of ""FIODE"" - no. 

Another possibility: ""HIOME"" - no. 

Wait, there's ""KIOTE"" - no. 

Let me think of other possibilities. ""LIQUE"" - no. 

Actually, ""DIODE"" is the only valid word left. However, let's check if there's another. 

""BIODE"" - no. 

""FIODE"" - no. 

""HIOME"" - no. 

""KIOTE"" - no. 

""LIQUE"" - no. 

""MIODE"" - M is out. 

""NIODE"" - N is out. 

""PIODE"" - P is out. 

""TIODE"" - T is out. 

""VIODE"" - V is out. 

""XIODE"" - X is possible but not common. 

""ZIODE"" - not a word. 

Thus, ""DIODE"" seems to be the only valid word left. However, let's check if ""DIODE"" is acceptable. 

But wait, ""DIODE"" has D in position 4, which is allowed because D is in the word but not in position 3 (which is O). 

Therefore, ""DIODE"" is the correct next guess.
</think>

The current pattern is _ I O _ E, with I fixed in position 2 and O fixed in position 3. The word must also contain D somewhere (from Guess 4 feedback: D(-)), and we have ruled out many letters. The only valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern is ""DIODE"".

Possible letters left for positions 1 and 4: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (excluding any already ruled out).

Looking for common words:
- B I O _ E: ""BIOME"" (but M is out), ""BIODE"" (not a word)
- D I O _ E: ""DIOGE"" (not a word), ""DIORE"" (not a word)
- F I O _ E: ""FIOME"" (not a word)
- H I O _ E: ""HIOME"" (not a word)
- K I O _ E: ""KIOTE"" (not a word)
- L I O _ E: ""LIQUE"" (not a word)
- W I O _ E: ""WIOBE"" (not a word)

Wait, let's think of actual words:
- ""BIODE"" is not valid.
- ""DIOGE"" is not valid.
- ""FIODE"" is not valid.
- ""HIOME"" is not valid.
- ""KIOTE"" is not valid.
- ""LIQUE"" is not valid.

Actually, the word ""DIODE"" comes to mind, but D is allowed anywhere except position 3 (which is O), and position 4 would be D. However, D is already known to be in the word (from Guess 4 feedback: D(-)), so ""DIODE"" is possible.

But let's check if D is allowed in position 4: yes, because D(-) means D is in the word but not in position 3 (which is O), so position 4 is fine.

Another possibility is ""FIODE"" but that's not a valid word. ""HIOME"" is not valid. ""KIOTE"" is not valid.

Actually, ""DIODE"" is a valid word (a type of semiconductor). It fits _ I O D E, with D in position 4, which is allowed.

But let's check if there's a more common word. ""BIODE"" isn't valid. ""FIODE"" isn't valid. ""LIQUE"" isn't valid.

Another thought: ""DIODE"" seems to be the only valid word fitting _ I O _ E with the remaining letters. However, let's think of ""KIOTE"" but that's not a word. 

Wait, there's ""FIODE"" but that's not valid. 

Actually, ""DIODE"" is the best fit. However, let's think of ""HIOME"" but that's not valid. 

Another possibility: ""KIOTE"" isn't valid. 

Let me reconsider: the word must be _ I O _ E. Valid words:
- ""BIOME"" (but M is out)
- ""DIODE"" (valid)
- ""FIODE"" (not valid)
- ""HIOME"" (not valid)
- ""KIOTE"" (not valid)
- ""LIQUE"" (not valid)

""DIODE"" seems to be the only valid word left. However, let's check ""KIOTE"" - no, that's not a word. 

Actually, ""DIODE"" is valid. But let's think of ""FIODE"" - no. 

Another possibility: ""HIOME"" - no. 

Wait, there's ""KIOTE"" - no. 

Let me think of other possibilities. ""LIQUE"" - no. 

Actually, ""DIODE"" is the only valid word left. However, let's check if there's another. 

""BIODE"" - no. 

""FIODE"" - no. 

""HIOME"" - no. 

""KIOTE"" - no. 

""LIQUE"" - no. 

""MIODE"" - M is out. 

""NIODE"" - N is out. 

""PIODE"" - P is out. 

""TIODE"" - T is out. 

""VIODE"" - V is out. 

""XIODE"" - X is possible but not common. 

""ZIODE"" - not a word. 

Thus, ""DIODE"" seems to be the only valid word left. However, let's check if ""DIODE"" is acceptable. 

But wait, ""DIODE"" has D in position 4, which is allowed because D is in the word but not in position 3 (which is O). 

Therefore, ""DIODE"" is the correct next guess.The current pattern is _ I O _ E, with I fixed in position 2 and O fixed in position 3. The word must also contain D somewhere (from Guess 4 feedback: D(-)), and we have ruled out many letters. The only valid 5-letter word fitting this pattern is ""DIODE"".",Guess 5: DIODE -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) I(✓) O(✓) D(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
