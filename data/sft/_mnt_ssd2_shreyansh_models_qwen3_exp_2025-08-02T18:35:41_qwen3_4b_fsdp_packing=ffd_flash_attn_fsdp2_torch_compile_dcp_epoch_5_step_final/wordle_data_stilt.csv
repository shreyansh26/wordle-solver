### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels and common consonants. Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", ""ADIEU"", etc.

Looking at these options, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should give me good information about which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word. Another good option is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - but I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency coverage.

I'll start with ""AROSE"".

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains S, but NOT in position 4.
- Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Includes S (not in 4th position).
2. Excludes A, R, O, E.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, D, C, H, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A, O, E are out).

Let’s pick a word that uses S plus common remaining letters.  
A word like “STUMP” uses S, T, U, M, P – none of which are excluded, and S is in a new position (1st instead of 4th).  
Another option is “SLING” but G isn’t as common.  
“SULKS” has S twice and K is less common.  
“SPLIT” uses S, P, L, I, T – all good letters, S in 1st position.

I’ll go with SPLIT.

Current known facts:
- S is in the word and is in position 1 (✓).
- T is in the word and is in position 5 (✓).
- L is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- I is in the word but not in position 4 (-).
- Letters not in the word: A, R, O, E, P.

So the pattern so far is:
S _ _ _ T
with L and I somewhere in positions 2, 3, or 4 (but not in their previously tried spots).

Possible positions:
- L cannot be in position 3, so it can be 2 or 4.
- I cannot be in position 4, so it can be 2 or 3.

Let's try to place L and I in the remaining slots while using new letters.

Option 1: L in position 2, I in position 3
Word: S L I _ T → need a letter for position 4 that hasn't been tried yet and isn't excluded. Good candidates: N, D, C, H, M, etc. ""SLINT"" isn't a valid word. ""SLIPT"" isn't valid. ""SLICT"" isn't valid. ""SLIMT"" isn't valid. ""SLINK"" is valid but K wasn't tested yet. Let's check: K wasn't excluded, so ""SLINK"" is possible.

Option 2: L in position 4, I in position 2
Word: S I _ L T → need a letter for position 3. ""SILFT"" isn't valid. ""SILGT"" isn't valid. ""SILMT"" isn't valid. ""SILNT"" isn't valid. ""SILPT"" isn't valid. ""SILYT"" isn't valid. Doesn't seem promising.

Option 3: L in position 4, I in position 3
Word: S _ I L T → need a letter for position 2. ""SKILT"" isn't valid. ""SNILT"" isn't valid. ""SHILT"" isn't valid. ""SMILT"" isn't valid. ""STILT"" is valid (a type of pole). Let's check: STILT uses S, T, I, L. All letters are allowed and positions fit constraints.

Between ""SLINK"" and ""STILT"", both fit constraints. ""STILT"" seems more likely as a valid word and uses common letters. I'll go with STILT.
