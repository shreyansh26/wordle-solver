### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities at once. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but NOT in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A somewhere other than position 3.
2. Avoids S, L, T, E entirely.

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, H, D, M, P, B, G, K, F, V, W, Y, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, O, U (since A is already known to be present).

A strong second guess would be a word that uses A in a different position and introduces new common letters. ""CRANK"" uses:
- C, R, N, K (all new consonants)
- A in the 2nd position (different from position 3 in SLATE)

This should give us more information about the remaining letters.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. Letters definitely NOT in the word: S, L, T, E, C, N, K

2. Letters definitely IN the word:  
   – R is in the word and is in the 2nd position (✓).  
   – A is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (it was “-” in both guesses, so it must also be “-” in the 4th position of CRANK).

3. Therefore the word looks like: _ R _ _ _

4. Remaining common letters to test: D, G, H, M, P, B, F, V, W, Y, I, O, U.

5. A good next guess should place A in a new position (1, 5) and introduce several new consonants.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities at once. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but NOT in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A somewhere other than position 3.
2. Avoids S, L, T, E entirely.

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, H, D, M, P, B, G, K, F, V, W, Y, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, O, U (since A is already known to be present).

A strong second guess would be a word that uses A in a different position and introduces new common letters. ""CRANK"" uses:
- C, R, N, K (all new consonants)
- A in the 2nd position (different from position 3 in SLATE)

This should give us more information about the remaining letters.

   – A is in the word but NOT in the 3rd position (it was “-” in both guesses, so it must also be “-” in the 4th position of CRANK).

3. Therefore the word looks like: _ R _ _ _  
   and it definitely contains the letter A somewhere except position 3 or 4.

4. Remaining common letters to test: D, G, H, M, P, B, F, V, W, Y, I, O, U.

5. A good next guess should place A in a new position (1, 5) and introduce several new consonants.  
   The word “GRAVY” does that:
   – G, V, Y are new letters.
   – A is now in the 4th position (which we haven’t ruled out yet).
   – R is already known to be in position 2, so this keeps that constraint.

- In GRAVY: A was in position 4 and marked “-”.  
- In ARBOR: A was in position 1 and marked “-”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me eliminate or confirm several possibilities at once. A good strategy is to use words with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. The word ""SLATE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- S (very common consonant)
- L (common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This gives us a good spread of letters to test against the secret word.

<|im_end|>

From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, T, E are NOT in the word (x).
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Contains the letter A, but NOT in the 3rd position.
- Does NOT contain S, L, T, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has A somewhere other than position 3.
2. Avoids S, L, T, E entirely.

Good consonants to try next: R, N, C, H, D, M, P, B, G, K, F, V, W, Y, etc.
Good vowels to try: I, O, U (since A is already known to be present).

A strong second guess would be a word that uses A in a different position and introduces new common letters. ""CRANK"" uses:
- C, R, N, K (all new consonants)
- A in the 2nd position (different from position 3 in SLATE)

This should give us more information about the remaining letters.

   This is impossible unless our interpretation is off.

Wait, let’s re-examine carefully:

- In CRANK: A was in position 3 and marked “-” (in word, wrong place).  
- In GRAVY: A was in position 4 and marked “-”.  
- In ARBOR: A was in position 1 and marked “-”.  
So A has been “-” in positions 1, 3, 4.  
The only remaining position for A is 5.

Thus the word must be: _ R _ _ A

4. Remaining unused common consonants: D, H, M, P, F, W, I, U.

5. A good next guess should place A in position 5 and introduce several new consonants.  
   The word “FRIDA” does that:
   – F, I, D are new letters.
   – R is in position 2 (already known).
   – A is in position 5 (the only remaining spot).

If this is correct, we’ll see R(✓) in position 2, A(✓) in position 5, and F, I, D will be “-” or “x” accordingly.

Let’s tabulate what we now know after five guesses.

Letters that are NOT in the word (x so far):
S, L, T, E, C, N, K, G, V, Y, B, O, D

Letters that ARE in the word and their positions:
- R is in position 2 (✓ in CRANK, GRAVY, ARBOR, FRIDA)
- F is in position 1 (✓ in FRIDA)
- I is in position 3 (✓ in FRIDA)
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (it was “-” in those positions).  
  The only remaining spot for A is position 2, but position 2 is already R.  
  This is a contradiction unless we misread.

Wait, let’s re-check the A placements:

- SLATE: A in 3 → “-”
- CRANK: A in 3 → “-”
- GRAVY: A in 4 → “-”
- ARBOR: A in 1 → “-”
- FRIDA: A in 5 → “-”

So A has been “-” in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.  
The only remaining position for A is 2, but position 2 is R.  
This means our assumption that A can be anywhere except those positions is correct, and the word must be _ R _ _ A, but we’ve already ruled out A in 5.

This suggests the word must be _ R _ _ _ with A somewhere not yet ruled out, but all positions except 2 are ruled out.  
The only possible word structure is _ R _ _ _ with A in position 2, but position 2 is R.  
This indicates an inconsistency, meaning our earlier deduction must be wrong.

Re-examining the feedback:

FRIDA: F(✓) R(✓) I(✓) D(x) A(-)

- F is in position 1 (✓)
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- I is in position 3 (✓)
- A is in the word but not in position 5
- D is not in the word

Thus the word must be F R I _ _ with A somewhere in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.  
But positions 1, 3 are already F, R, I.  
So A must be in position 4 or 5.  
From earlier feedback:
- A was “-” in positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (from SLATE, CRANK, GRAVY, FRIDA).  
  This means A cannot be in 4 or 5 either.  

This is impossible unless the word is F R I _ A, but A cannot be in 5.  

Wait, let’s list all constraints again:

1. Word structure: _ R _ _ _ (R in 2)
2. Letters known to be in word: F, I, A
3. A cannot be in 1, 3, 4, 5 → impossible.

This suggests an error in our interpretation.  
Recheck FRIDA feedback:  
F(✓) R(✓) I(✓) D(x) A(-)

- F is in position 1 (✓)
- R is in position 2 (✓)
- I is in position 3 (✓)
- A is in the word but not in position 5
- D is not in the word

Thus the word must be F R I _ _ with A in position 4 (since 5 is ruled out).  

So the word is F R I A _.

Remaining unused letters (not yet ruled out): H, M, P, W, U, etc.

A good guess is FRIAR, but R is already in position 2.  
Next: FRIAM – but M is unused.  
But we need a valid 5-letter word.

Valid word: FRIAR (but R is already in 2, and we have two Rs).  
Another: FRIED – but D is ruled out.  
FRIAL – not a valid word.  
FRIAM – not valid.  
FRIAP – not valid.  

Valid word: FRIAR is possible (double R).  
But let’s check: F R I A R.  
Positions: 1-F, 2-R, 3-I, 4-A, 5-R.  
This fits all constraints:
- R in 2 (✓)
- F in 1 (✓)
- I in 3 (✓)
- A in 4 (never ruled out for position 4, only that it’s not in 1,3,5)
- R in 5 is allowed.

Thus the word must be FRIAR.
