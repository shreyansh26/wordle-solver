For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with distinct common letters to test as many as possible. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities right away.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters in the word: R, O, E
- Letters not in the word: A, S
- Positions to avoid for R, O, E: 2, 3, 5 respectively.

We need a 5-letter word that contains R, O, E and does not contain A or S. Also, R cannot be in position 2, O cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.

Good candidates might be:
- ""ROE"" plus two other letters that aren't A or S.
- ""ORE"" plus two other letters that aren't A or S.
- ""TROPE"" but it has P and T, and E is in position 5 which is invalid.
- ""CRORE"" but it has C and R, but O is in position 3 which is invalid.
- ""TRODE"" - let's check: T, R, O, D, E. 
  - R is in position 2 which is invalid (from feedback R cannot be in position 2).
- ""ROBED"" - R in position 1 (valid), O in position 2 (valid), B not used, E in position 4 (valid), D not used. This seems valid.
- ""ROGER"" - R in position 1 (valid), O in position 2 (valid), G not used, E in position 4 (valid), R in position 5 (valid). This seems valid.
- ""BROKE"" - B, R, O, K, E. R in position 2 which is invalid.
- ""TROPE"" - E in position 5 which is invalid.
- ""FRORE"" - but has two R's which might not be optimal.

""ROGER"" seems good because:
- Uses R, O, E.
- Does not use A or S.
- R is in position 1 (valid), O in position 2 (valid), E in position 4 (valid).
- Has two R's which might be useful for confirmation.

But ""ROGER"" has R in position 1 and 5, which could help confirm R's positions. However, since we only know R is not in position 2, position 1 or 5 are fine.

Another option is ""TROPE"" but E is in position 5 which is invalid. ""TRODE"" has E in position 4 which is valid.

Between ""ROGER"" and ""TRODE"", ""ROGER"" seems better because it tests G and another R, which could help confirm R's presence.

But let's think of a word that uses R, O, E without the extra letters. ""TROPE"" is invalid because of E in position 5. ""TRODE"" is valid: T, R, O, D, E. R is in position 2 which is invalid (from feedback R cannot be in position 2).

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback:
- R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 2. So R can be in positions 1,3,4,5.
- O(-) means O is in the word but not in position 3. So O can be in positions 1,2,4,5.
- E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5. So E can be in positions 1,2,3,4.

Looking for a word that satisfies these constraints:
- Must have R, O, E.
- Must not have A or S.
- R not in position 2.
- O not in position 3.
- E not in position 5.

Possible words:
- ""ROE"" plus two other letters: ""ROE"" is 3 letters, need two more. ""ROE"" could be part of ""TROPE"" but E is in position 5 invalid. ""BROKE"" has E in position 5 invalid. ""FROZE"" has Z, E in position 5 invalid. ""DROVE"" has E in position 5 invalid. ""GROPE"" has E in position 5 invalid. ""CRORE"" has O in position 3 invalid. ""TROVE"" has E in position 5 invalid.

Another approach: use ""O"" in position 1 or 2, ""R"" in positions 1,3,4,5, ""E"" in positions 1,2,3,4.

""ORE"" is 3 letters. ""TROPE"" invalid. ""FRORE"" has O in position 3 invalid. ""TRODE"" has R in position 2 invalid.

""ROGER"" has R in position 1 and 5, O in position 2, E in position 4. This seems valid:
- R not in position 2 (it's in 1 and 5).
- O not in position 3 (it's in 2).
- E not in position 5 (it's in 4).
- No A or S.

""ROGER"" seems like the best next guess.

But let me think if there's a better word. ""TROPE"" invalid. ""BROKE"" invalid. ""FROZE"" invalid. ""CRORE"" invalid. ""DROVE"" invalid. ""GROPE"" invalid. ""HORSE"" has S invalid. ""MORSE"" has S invalid. ""NORSE"" has S invalid. ""PORSE"" has S invalid. ""WORSE"" has S invalid.

""ROGER"" seems to be the only valid word that fits the constraints. Let me check ""ROGER"":
- R in position 1 (valid, not in 2).
- O in position 2 (valid, not in 3).
- G not used (but that's fine).
- E in position 4 (valid, not in 5).
- R in position 5 (valid, not in 2).

This seems correct.
</think>

Based on the feedback from ""arose"":
- R, O, E are in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively.
- A and S are not in the word.

A good next guess should place R, O, E in new positions while avoiding A and S. The word ""ROGER"" satisfies these constraints:
- R is in positions 1 and 5 (not 2).
- O is in position 2 (not 3).
- E is in position 4 (not 5).
- No A or S.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with distinct common letters to test as many as possible. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities right away.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters in the word: R, O, E
- Letters not in the word: A, S
- Positions to avoid for R, O, E: 2, 3, 5 respectively.

We need a 5-letter word that contains R, O, E and does not contain A or S. Also, R cannot be in position 2, O cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.

Good candidates might be:
- ""ROE"" plus two other letters that aren't A or S.
- ""ORE"" plus two other letters that aren't A or S.
- ""TROPE"" but it has P and T, and E is in position 5 which is invalid.
- ""CRORE"" but it has C and R, but O is in position 3 which is invalid.
- ""TRODE"" - let's check: T, R, O, D, E. 
  - R is in position 2 which is invalid (from feedback R cannot be in position 2).
- ""ROBED"" - R in position 1 (valid), O in position 2 (valid), B not used, E in position 4 (valid), D not used. This seems valid.
- ""ROGER"" - R in position 1 (valid), O in position 2 (valid), G not used, E in position 4 (valid), R in position 5 (valid). This seems valid.
- ""BROKE"" - B, R, O, K, E. R in position 2 which is invalid.
- ""TROPE"" - E in position 5 which is invalid.
- ""FRORE"" - but has two R's which might not be optimal.

""ROGER"" seems good because:
- Uses R, O, E.
- Does not use A or S.
- R is in position 1 (valid), O in position 2 (valid), E in position 4 (valid).
- Has two R's which might be useful for confirmation.

But ""ROGER"" has R in position 1 and 5, which could help confirm R's positions. However, since we only know R is not in position 2, position 1 or 5 are fine.

Another option is ""TROPE"" but E is in position 5 which is invalid. ""TRODE"" has E in position 4 which is valid.

Between ""ROGER"" and ""TRODE"", ""ROGER"" seems better because it tests G and another R, which could help confirm R's presence.

But let's think of a word that uses R, O, E without the extra letters. ""TROPE"" is invalid because of E in position 5. ""TRODE"" is valid: T, R, O, D, E. R is in position 2 which is invalid (from feedback R cannot be in position 2).

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback:
- R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 2. So R can be in positions 1,3,4,5.
- O(-) means O is in the word but not in position 3. So O can be in positions 1,2,4,5.
- E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5. So E can be in positions 1,2,3,4.

Looking for a word that satisfies these constraints:
- Must have R, O, E.
- Must not have A or S.
- R not in position 2.
- O not in position 3.
- E not in position 5.

Possible words:
- ""ROE"" plus two other letters: ""ROE"" is 3 letters, need two more. ""ROE"" could be part of ""TROPE"" but E is in position 5 invalid. ""BROKE"" has E in position 5 invalid. ""FROZE"" has Z, E in position 5 invalid. ""DROVE"" has E in position 5 invalid. ""GROPE"" has E in position 5 invalid. ""CRORE"" has O in position 3 invalid. ""TROVE"" has E in position 5 invalid.

Another approach: use ""O"" in position 1 or 2, ""R"" in positions 1,3,4,5, ""E"" in positions 1,2,3,4.

""ORE"" is 3 letters. ""TROPE"" invalid. ""FRORE"" has O in position 3 invalid. ""TRODE"" has R in position 2 invalid.

""ROGER"" has R in position 1 and 5, O in position 2, E in position 4. This seems valid:
- R not in position 2 (it's in 1 and 5).
- O not in position 3 (it's in 2).
- E not in position 5 (it's in 4).
- No A or S.

""ROGER"" seems like the best next guess.

But let me think if there's a better word. ""TROPE"" invalid. ""BROKE"" invalid. ""FROZE"" invalid. ""CRORE"" invalid. ""DROVE"" invalid. ""GROPE"" invalid. ""HORSE"" has S invalid. ""MORSE"" has S invalid. ""NORSE"" has S invalid. ""PORSE"" has S invalid. ""WORSE"" has S invalid.

""ROGER"" seems to be the only valid word that fits the constraints. Let me check ""ROGER"":
- R in position 1 (valid, not in 2).
- O in position 2 (valid, not in 3).
- G not used (but that's fine).
- E in position 4 (valid, not in 5).
- R in position 5 (valid, not in 2).

This seems correct.Based on the feedback from ""arose"":
- R, O, E are in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively.
- A and S are not in the word.

A good next guess should place R, O, E in new positions while avoiding A and S. The word ""ROGER"" satisfies these constraints:
- R is in positions 1 and 5 (not 2).
- O is in position 2 (not 3).
- E is in position 4 (not 5).
- No A or S.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with distinct common letters to test as many as possible. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities right away.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters in the word: R, O, E
- Letters not in the word: A, S
- Positions to avoid for R, O, E: 2, 3, 5 respectively.

We need a 5-letter word that contains R, O, E and does not contain A or S. Also, R cannot be in position 2, O cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.

Good candidates might be:
- ""ROE"" plus two other letters that aren't A or S.
- ""ORE"" plus two other letters that aren't A or S.
- ""TROPE"" but it has P and T, and E is in position 5 which is invalid.
- ""CRORE"" but it has C and R, but O is in position 3 which is invalid.
- ""TRODE"" - let's check: T, R, O, D, E. 
  - R is in position 2 which is invalid (from feedback R cannot be in position 2).
- ""ROBED"" - R in position 1 (valid), O in position 2 (valid), B not used, E in position 4 (valid), D not used. This seems valid.
- ""ROGER"" - R in position 1 (valid), O in position 2 (valid), G not used, E in position 4 (valid), R in position 5 (valid). This seems valid.
- ""BROKE"" - B, R, O, K, E. R in position 2 which is invalid.
- ""TROPE"" - E in position 5 which is invalid.
- ""FRORE"" - but has two R's which might not be optimal.

""ROGER"" seems good because:
- Uses R, O, E.
- Does not use A or S.
- R is in position 1 (valid), O in position 2 (valid), E in position 4 (valid).
- Has two R's which might be useful for confirmation.

But ""ROGER"" has R in position 1 and 5, which could help confirm R's positions. However, since we only know R is not in position 2, position 1 or 5 are fine.

Another option is ""TROPE"" but E is in position 5 which is invalid. ""TRODE"" has E in position 4 which is valid.

Between ""ROGER"" and ""TRODE"", ""ROGER"" seems better because it tests G and another R, which could help confirm R's presence.

But let's think of a word that uses R, O, E without the extra letters. ""TROPE"" is invalid because of E in position 5. ""TRODE"" is valid: T, R, O, D, E. R is in position 2 which is invalid (from feedback R cannot be in position 2).

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback:
- R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 2. So R can be in positions 1,3,4,5.
- O(-) means O is in the word but not in position 3. So O can be in positions 1,2,4,5.
- E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5. So E can be in positions 1,2,3,4.

Looking for a word that satisfies these constraints:
- Must have R, O, E.
- Must not have A or S.
- R not in position 2.
- O not in position 3.
- E not in position 5.

Possible words:
- ""ROE"" plus two other letters: ""ROE"" is 3 letters, need two more. ""ROE"" could be part of ""TROPE"" but E is in position 5 invalid. ""BROKE"" has E in position 5 invalid. ""FROZE"" has Z, E in position 5 invalid. ""DROVE"" has E in position 5 invalid. ""GROPE"" has E in position 5 invalid. ""CRORE"" has O in position 3 invalid. ""TROVE"" has E in position 5 invalid.

Another approach: use ""O"" in position 1 or 2, ""R"" in positions 1,3,4,5, ""E"" in positions 1,2,3,4.

""ORE"" is 3 letters. ""TROPE"" invalid. ""FRORE"" has O in position 3 invalid. ""TRODE"" has R in position 2 invalid.

""ROGER"" has R in position 1 and 5, O in position 2, E in position 4. This seems valid:
- R not in position 2 (it's in 1 and 5).
- O not in position 3 (it's in 2).
- E not in position 5 (it's in 4).
- No A or S.

""ROGER"" seems like the best next guess.

But let me think if there's a better word. ""TROPE"" invalid. ""BROKE"" invalid. ""FROZE"" invalid. ""CRORE"" invalid. ""DROVE"" invalid. ""GROPE"" invalid. ""HORSE"" has S invalid. ""MORSE"" has S invalid. ""NORSE"" has S invalid. ""PORSE"" has S invalid. ""WORSE"" has S invalid.

""ROGER"" seems to be the only valid word that fits the constraints. Let me check ""ROGER"":
- R in position 1 (valid, not in 2).
- O in position 2 (valid, not in 3).
- G not used (but that's fine).
- E in position 4 (valid, not in 5).
- R in position 5 (valid, not in 2).

This seems correct.Based on the feedback from ""arose"":
- R, O, E are in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively.
- A and S are not in the word.

A good next guess should place R, O, E in new positions while avoiding A and S. The word ""ROGER"" satisfies these constraints:
- R is in positions 1 and 5 (not 2).
- O is in position 2 (not 3).
- E is in position 4 (not 5).
- No A or S.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: roger -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on ""roger"":
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (we already knew it's not in position 2).
- O(✓) → O is in the word AND in position 2 (so O is fixed in slot 2).
- G(x) → G is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in position 4 (so E is fixed in slot 4).
- R(✓) → R is in the word AND in position 5 (so R is fixed in slot 5).

So far we have:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R
- Letters confirmed: O, E, R
- Letters eliminated: A, S, G
- Remaining letters to test: positions 1 and 3, using letters not yet ruled out.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ O _ E R, where:
- Position 1: not A, S, G, and not already used (O, E, R).
- Position 3: not A, S, G, and not already used (O, E, R).

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common patterns _ O _ E R:
- B O _ E R → ""BOPER""? No, P is allowed but ""BOPER"" isn't a word.
- C O _ E R → ""COPER"" (a real word meaning copper miner or the mineral).
- D O _ E R → ""DOBER""? Not a standard word.
- F O _ E R → ""FOBER""? Not standard.
- H O _ E R → ""HOPER""? Not standard.
- M O _ E R → ""MOVER"" (a real word).

Between ""COPER"" and ""MOVER"":
- Both fit the pattern and constraints.
- ""MOVER"" is more common and uses M which is still allowed.
- ""COPER"" is also valid but slightly less common.

Let's go with ""MOVER"".

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word with distinct common letters to test as many as possible. 

Looking at these letters, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 5 distinct common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities right away.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters in the word: R, O, E
- Letters not in the word: A, S
- Positions to avoid for R, O, E: 2, 3, 5 respectively.

We need a 5-letter word that contains R, O, E and does not contain A or S. Also, R cannot be in position 2, O cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.

Good candidates might be:
- ""ROE"" plus two other letters that aren't A or S.
- ""ORE"" plus two other letters that aren't A or S.
- ""TROPE"" but it has P and T, and E is in position 5 which is invalid.
- ""CRORE"" but it has C and R, but O is in position 3 which is invalid.
- ""TRODE"" - let's check: T, R, O, D, E. 
  - R is in position 2 which is invalid (from feedback R cannot be in position 2).
- ""ROBED"" - R in position 1 (valid), O in position 2 (valid), B not used, E in position 4 (valid), D not used. This seems valid.
- ""ROGER"" - R in position 1 (valid), O in position 2 (valid), G not used, E in position 4 (valid), R in position 5 (valid). This seems valid.
- ""BROKE"" - B, R, O, K, E. R in position 2 which is invalid.
- ""TROPE"" - E in position 5 which is invalid.
- ""FRORE"" - but has two R's which might not be optimal.

""ROGER"" seems good because:
- Uses R, O, E.
- Does not use A or S.
- R is in position 1 (valid), O in position 2 (valid), E in position 4 (valid).
- Has two R's which might be useful for confirmation.

But ""ROGER"" has R in position 1 and 5, which could help confirm R's positions. However, since we only know R is not in position 2, position 1 or 5 are fine.

Another option is ""TROPE"" but E is in position 5 which is invalid. ""TRODE"" has E in position 4 which is valid.

Between ""ROGER"" and ""TRODE"", ""ROGER"" seems better because it tests G and another R, which could help confirm R's presence.

But let's think of a word that uses R, O, E without the extra letters. ""TROPE"" is invalid because of E in position 5. ""TRODE"" is valid: T, R, O, D, E. R is in position 2 which is invalid (from feedback R cannot be in position 2).

Wait, let me re-examine the feedback:
- R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 2. So R can be in positions 1,3,4,5.
- O(-) means O is in the word but not in position 3. So O can be in positions 1,2,4,5.
- E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5. So E can be in positions 1,2,3,4.

Looking for a word that satisfies these constraints:
- Must have R, O, E.
- Must not have A or S.
- R not in position 2.
- O not in position 3.
- E not in position 5.

Possible words:
- ""ROE"" plus two other letters: ""ROE"" is 3 letters, need two more. ""ROE"" could be part of ""TROPE"" but E is in position 5 invalid. ""BROKE"" has E in position 5 invalid. ""FROZE"" has Z, E in position 5 invalid. ""DROVE"" has E in position 5 invalid. ""GROPE"" has E in position 5 invalid. ""CRORE"" has O in position 3 invalid. ""TROVE"" has E in position 5 invalid.

Another approach: use ""O"" in position 1 or 2, ""R"" in positions 1,3,4,5, ""E"" in positions 1,2,3,4.

""ORE"" is 3 letters. ""TROPE"" invalid. ""FRORE"" has O in position 3 invalid. ""TRODE"" has R in position 2 invalid.

""ROGER"" has R in position 1 and 5, O in position 2, E in position 4. This seems valid:
- R not in position 2 (it's in 1 and 5).
- O not in position 3 (it's in 2).
- E not in position 5 (it's in 4).
- No A or S.

""ROGER"" seems like the best next guess.

But let me think if there's a better word. ""TROPE"" invalid. ""BROKE"" invalid. ""FROZE"" invalid. ""CRORE"" invalid. ""DROVE"" invalid. ""GROPE"" invalid. ""HORSE"" has S invalid. ""MORSE"" has S invalid. ""NORSE"" has S invalid. ""PORSE"" has S invalid. ""WORSE"" has S invalid.

""ROGER"" seems to be the only valid word that fits the constraints. Let me check ""ROGER"":
- R in position 1 (valid, not in 2).
- O in position 2 (valid, not in 3).
- G not used (but that's fine).
- E in position 4 (valid, not in 5).
- R in position 5 (valid, not in 2).

This seems correct.Based on the feedback from ""arose"":
- R, O, E are in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively.
- A and S are not in the word.

A good next guess should place R, O, E in new positions while avoiding A and S. The word ""ROGER"" satisfies these constraints:
- R is in positions 1 and 5 (not 2).
- O is in position 2 (not 3).
- E is in position 4 (not 5).
- No A or S.

Guess 2: roger -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>

From the new feedback on ""roger"":
- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (we already knew it's not in position 2).
- O(✓) → O is in the word AND in position 2 (so O is fixed in slot 2).
- G(x) → G is NOT in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in position 4 (so E is fixed in slot 4).
- R(✓) → R is in the word AND in position 5 (so R is fixed in slot 5).

So far we have:
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R
- Letters confirmed: O, E, R
- Letters eliminated: A, S, G
- Remaining letters to test: positions 1 and 3, using letters not yet ruled out.

We need a 5-letter word of the form _ O _ E R, where:
- Position 1: not A, S, G, and not already used (O, E, R).
- Position 3: not A, S, G, and not already used (O, E, R).

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common patterns _ O _ E R:
- B O _ E R → ""BOPER""? No, P is allowed but ""BOPER"" isn't a word.
- C O _ E R → ""COPER"" (a real word meaning copper miner or the mineral).
- D O _ E R → ""DOBER""? Not a standard word.
- F O _ E R → ""FOBER""? Not standard.
- H O _ E R → ""HOPER""? Not standard.
- M O _ E R → ""MOVER"" (a real word).

Between ""COPER"" and ""MOVER"":
- Both fit the pattern and constraints.
- ""MOVER"" is more common and uses M which is still allowed.
- ""COPER"" is also valid but slightly less common.

R in position 2 which is invalid.\n- ""TROPE"" - E in position 5 which is invalid.\n- ""FRORE"" - but has two R\'s which might not be optimal.\n\n""ROGER"" seems good because:\n- Uses R, O, E.\n- Does not use A or S.\n- R is in position 1 (valid), O in position 2 (valid), E in position 4 (valid).\n- Has two R\'s which might be useful for confirmation.\n\nBut ""ROGER"" has R in position 1 and 5, which could help confirm R\'s positions. However, since we only know R is not in position 2, position 1 or 5 are fine.\n\nAnother option is ""TROPE"" but E is in position 5 which is invalid. ""TRODE"" has E in position 4 which is valid.\n\nBetween ""ROGER"" and ""TRODE"", ""ROGER"" seems better because it tests G and another R, which could help confirm R\'s presence.\n\nBut let\'s think of a word that uses R, O, E without the extra letters. ""TROPE"" is invalid because of E in position 5. ""TRODE"" is valid: T, R, O, D, E. R is in position 2 which is invalid (from feedback R cannot be in position 2).\n\nWait, let me re-examine the feedback:\n- R(-) means R is in the word but not in position 2. So R can be in positions 1,3,4,5.\n- O(-) means O is in the word but not in position 3. So O can be in positions 1,2,4,5.\n- E(-) means E is in the word but not in position 5. So E can be in positions 1,2,3,4.\n\nLooking for a word that satisfies these constraints:\n- Must have R, O, E.\n- Must not have A or S.\n- R not in position 2.\n- O not in position 3.\n- E not in position 5.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""ROE"" plus two other letters: ""ROE"" is 3 letters, need two more. ""ROE"" could be part of ""TROPE"" but E is in position 5 invalid. ""BROKE"" has E in position 5 invalid. ""FROZE"" has Z, E in position 5 invalid. ""DROVE"" has E in position 5 invalid. ""GROPE"" has E in position 5 invalid. ""CRORE"" has O in position 3 invalid. ""TROVE"" has E in position 5 invalid.\n\nAnother approach: use ""O"" in position 1 or 2, ""R"" in positions 1,3,4,5, ""E"" in positions 1,2,3,4.\n\n""ORE"" is 3 letters. ""TROPE"" invalid. ""FRORE"" has O in position 3 invalid. ""TRODE"" has R in position 2 invalid.\n\n""ROGER"" has R in position 1 and 5, O in position 2, E in position 4. This seems valid:\n- R not in position 2 (it\'s in 1 and 5).\n- O not in position 3 (it\'s in 2).\n- E not in position 5 (it\'s in 4).\n- No A or S.\n\n""ROGER"" seems like the best next guess.\n\nBut let me think if there\'s a better word. ""TROPE"" invalid. ""BROKE"" invalid. ""FROZE"" invalid. ""CRORE"" invalid. ""DROVE"" invalid. ""GROPE"" invalid. ""HORSE"" has S invalid. ""MORSE"" has S invalid. ""NORSE"" has S invalid. ""PORSE"" has S invalid. ""WORSE"" has S invalid.\n\n""ROGER"" seems to be the only valid word that fits the constraints. Let me check ""ROGER"":\n- R in position 1 (valid, not in 2).\n- O in position 2 (valid, not in 3).\n- G not used (but that\'s fine).\n- E in position 4 (valid, not in 5).\n- R in position 5 (valid, not in 2).\n\nThis seems correct.Based on the feedback from ""arose"":\n- R, O, E are in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 5 respectively.\n- A and S are not in the word.\n\nA good next guess should place R, O, E in new positions while avoiding A and S. The word ""ROGER"" satisfies these constraints:\n- R is in positions 1 and 5 (not 2).\n- O is in position 2 (not 3).\n- E is in position 4 (not 5).\n- No A or S.\n\n<guess>roger</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: roger -> FEEDBACK: R(-) O(✓) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback on ""roger"":\n- R(-) → R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (we already knew it\'s not in position 2).\n- O(✓) → O is in the word AND in position 2 (so O is fixed in slot 2).\n- G(x) → G is NOT in the word.\n- E(✓) → E is in the word AND in position 4 (so E is fixed in slot 4).\n- R(✓) → R is in the word AND in position 5 (so R is fixed in slot 5).\n\nSo far we have:\n- Position 2: O\n- Position 4: E\n- Position 5: R\n- Letters confirmed: O, E, R\n- Letters eliminated: A, S, G\n- Remaining letters to test: positions 1 and 3, using letters not yet ruled out.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word of the form _ O _ E R, where:\n- Position 1: not A, S, G, and not already used (O, E, R).\n- Position 3: not A, S, G, and not already used (O, E, R).\n\nPossible letters left: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nLooking for common patterns _ O _ E R:\n- B O _ E R → ""BOPER""?
