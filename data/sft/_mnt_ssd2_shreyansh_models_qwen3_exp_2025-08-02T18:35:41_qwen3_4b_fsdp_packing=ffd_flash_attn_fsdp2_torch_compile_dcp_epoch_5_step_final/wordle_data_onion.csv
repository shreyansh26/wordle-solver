For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word, especially vowels like A and E, which appear in many words. Other good options might be ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"", but ""SLATE"" seems like a strong starting choice.

All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every word that contains any of those letters.

To maximize information, I need a word that:
1. Uses only letters not in {S, L, A, T, E}
2. Contains common remaining consonants and vowels to test new letters efficiently

Remaining common vowels: I, O, U  
Remaining common consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

A good candidate is “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D are all letters not in SLATE.
- It tests the common vowels O and U, plus R, N, D.

Other options could be “CHURN”, “CRIMP”, etc., but “ROUND” seems balanced.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word, especially vowels like A and E, which appear in many words. Other good options might be ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"", but ""SLATE"" seems like a strong starting choice.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every word that contains any of those letters.

To maximize information, I need a word that:
1. Uses only letters not in {S, L, A, T, E}
2. Contains common remaining consonants and vowels to test new letters efficiently

Remaining common vowels: I, O, U  
Remaining common consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

A good candidate is “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D are all letters not in SLATE.
- It tests the common vowels O and U, plus R, N, D.

Other options could be “CHURN”, “CRIMP”, etc., but “ROUND” seems balanced.

From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
   Eliminates: S, L, A, T, E

2. ROUND → R(x) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)  
   Eliminates: R, U, D  
   Confirms: O is in the word but not in position 2, N is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word:
- Contains O and N  
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D

Remaining common letters we can test: I, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O and N  
- Uses only letters from the allowed set {B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z} plus O and N  
- Doesn’t place O in position 2 or N in position 4

A good candidate is “CHINO”:
- C, H, I, N, O are all allowed letters  
- Contains both O and N  
- O is in position 4 (allowed, since it’s not position 2)  
- N is in position 3 (allowed, since it’s not position 4)

Let me verify: CHINO is a valid 5-letter English word and fits all constraints.

Let’s consolidate everything we now know:

1. Eliminated letters (never appear):  
   S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D, C, H, B, G

2. Confirmed letters (must appear somewhere):  
   I, N, O

3. Position restrictions:
   - I cannot be in position 3 (because BINGO gave I(-), i.e., it is in the word but not in position 2).  
     Actually, the feedback “I(-)” means I is in the word but not in position 2.  
     So I must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
   - N cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (from ROUND and BINGO both gave N(-)).  
     So N must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
   - O cannot be in positions 2 or 4 (from ROUND and BINGO both gave O(-)).  
     So O must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

4. Allowed letters remaining:  
   F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus the required I, N, O).

5. We need a 5-letter word that:
   - Contains exactly one I, one N, one O.  
   - Places I, N, O only in allowed positions.  
   - Fills the remaining two slots with letters from the allowed set {F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.

6. Possible positions for I, N, O:
   - I: 1, 3, 4, 5  
   - N: 1, 3, 5  
   - O: 1, 3, 5  

7. Let’s list possible combinations of positions for I, N, O:
   - If I is in position 1:  
     Then N and O must go in positions 3 or 5 (but not both in the same position).  
     Possible patterns: I _ I _ O or I _ O _ I – but we need to place N and O exactly once each.  
     So: I _ N O _ or I _ O N _  
     But N and O must be in allowed positions.  
     Let’s try I _ N O _ : N is in position 3 (allowed), O in position 4 (but O cannot be in position 4).  
     So invalid.  
     Try I _ O N _ : O in position 3 (allowed), N in position 4 (but N cannot be in position 4).  
     Invalid.  
   - If I is in position 3:  
     Then N and O must go in positions 1, 4, or 5.  
     But O cannot be in position 4, N cannot be in position 4.  
     So possible: N _ I O _ or _ _ I O N or _ N I O _ or O _ I N _ etc.  
     Let’s try N _ I O _ : N in 1 (allowed), O in 4 (invalid).  
     Try _ N I O _ : N in 2 (invalid, N cannot be in 2).  
     Try _ _ I N O : N in 4 (invalid).  
     Try O _ I N _ : O in 1 (allowed), N in 4 (invalid).  
     Try _ O I N _ : N in 4 (invalid).  
     Try N O I _ _ : N in 1 (allowed), O in 2 (invalid).  
     Try O N I _ _ : O in 1 (allowed), N in 2 (invalid).  
     Try _ O I _ N : N in 5 (allowed), O in 2 (invalid).  
     Try _ N I _ O : O in 5 (allowed), N in 2 (invalid).  
     Hmm, seems like position 3 for I is problematic because N and O can’t both fit without violating position restrictions.  
   - If I is in position 4:  
     Then N and O must go in positions 1, 3, or 5.  
     Let’s try N _ _ I O : N in 1 (allowed), O in 5 (allowed).  
     So the word would be N _ _ I O.  
     The middle two letters must be from the allowed set {F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.  
     Let’s pick N F K I O – but “NF KIO” isn’t a valid word.  
     Let’s think of real words:  
     “NIXON” – but X is allowed, N is allowed, I is allowed, O is allowed, N is allowed.  
     Check positions:  
     N (1) – allowed  
     I (2) – but I is supposed to be in position 4.  
     Doesn’t fit.  
     “FINKO” – F, I, N, K, O.  
     I is in position 2, but we need I in position 4.  
     Doesn’t fit.  
     “PINKO” – P, I, N, K, O.  
     I is in position 2, needs to be 4.  
     Doesn’t fit.  
     “VINKO” – same issue.  
     “MINCO” – M, I, N, C, O – but C is eliminated.  
     “FINCO” – C eliminated.  
     “JINKO” – J, I, N, K, O – I in 2, not 4.  
     “WINKO” – same.  
     “YINKO” – same.  
     “ZINKO” – same.  
     “FUNKO” – F, U, N, K, O – but U is eliminated.  
     “PUNKO” – same.  
     “VUNKO” – same.  
     “MINKO” – M, I, N, K, O – I in 2.  
     Doesn’t fit.  
   - If I is in position 5:  
     Then N and O must go in positions 1, 3, or 4.  
     But O cannot be in position 4, N cannot be in position 4.  
     So N and O must be in positions 1 and 3.  
     Possible patterns: N _ O _ I or O _ N _ I.  
     Let’s try N _ O _ I:  
     N (1) – allowed  
     O (3) – allowed  
     I (5) – allowed  
     The middle letters must be from allowed set.  
     Let’s think of real words:  
     “N O _ _ I” – need two more letters.  
     “N O F _ I” – “N OFI_” – not a word.  
     “N O M _ I” – “NOMI_” – “NOMIK” – not a word.  
     “N O P _ I” – “NOP_I” – “NOPIC” – C eliminated.  
     “N O V _ I” – “NOV_I” – “NOVIL” – L eliminated.  
     “N O K _ I” – “NOK_I” – “NOKIS” – S eliminated.  
     “N O J _ I” – “NOJ_I” – not a word.  
     “N O Y _ I” – “NOY_I” – not a word.  
     “N O Z _ I” – “NOZ_I” – not a word.  
     “O _ N _ I”:  
     O (1) – allowed  
     N (3) – allowed  
     I (5) – allowed  
     Middle letters: must be from allowed set.  
     Real words:  
     “O F N _ I” – “OFNI_” – “OFNIL” – L eliminated.  
     “O M N _ I” – “OMNI_” – “OMNIB” – B eliminated.  
     “O P N _ I” – “OPNI_” – not a word.  
     “O V N _ I” – “OVNI_” – “OVNIS” – S eliminated.  
     “O K N _ I” – “OKNI_” – not a word.  
     “O J N _ I” – “OJNI_” – not a word.  
     “O Y N _ I” – “OYNI_” – not a word.  
     “O Z N _ I” – “OZNI_” – not a word.  
     Hmm, none of these seem to form valid words.  
     Let’s step back and think of real 5-letter words that contain I, N, O with the position constraints.  
     Allowed letters: I, N, O plus F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
     Real words that fit:  
     - “MINOR” – R eliminated.  
     - “PINOY” – Y is allowed, but P, I, N, O, Y.  
       Check positions:  
       P (1) – allowed  
       I (2) – but I must be in 1,3,4,5.  
       Doesn’t fit.  
     - “VINO” – too short.  
     - “KINOF” – not a word.  
     - “JINOS” – S eliminated.  
     - “FINKO” – already considered.  
     - “WINKO” – already considered.  
     - “YINCO” – C eliminated.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring vowels and consonants. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""SLATE"" is often recommended because it contains:
- S (very common starting letter)
- L (common consonant)
- A (most common vowel)
- T (common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me a good chance to hit multiple letters in the secret word, especially vowels like A and E, which appear in many words. Other good options might be ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""AUDIO"", but ""SLATE"" seems like a strong starting choice.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
All five letters in SLATE (S, L, A, T, E) are completely absent from the secret word.  
That means we can eliminate every word that contains any of those letters.

To maximize information, I need a word that:
1. Uses only letters not in {S, L, A, T, E}
2. Contains common remaining consonants and vowels to test new letters efficiently

Remaining common vowels: I, O, U  
Remaining common consonants: R, N, C, D, M, P, B, F, G, H, K, etc.

A good candidate is “ROUND”:
- R, O, U, N, D are all letters not in SLATE.
- It tests the common vowels O and U, plus R, N, D.

Other options could be “CHURN”, “CRIMP”, etc., but “ROUND” seems balanced.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: SLATE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ROUND -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
   Eliminates: S, L, A, T, E

2. ROUND → R(x) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)  
   Eliminates: R, U, D  
   Confirms: O is in the word but not in position 2, N is in the word but not in position 4.

So the secret word:
- Contains O and N  
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D

Remaining common letters we can test: I, C, M, P, B, G, H, K, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O and N  
- Uses only letters from the allowed set {B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z} plus O and N  
- Doesn’t place O in position 2 or N in position 4

A good candidate is “CHINO”:
- C, H, I, N, O are all allowed letters  
- Contains both O and N  
- O is in position 4 (allowed, since it’s not position 2)  
- N is in position 3 (allowed, since it’s not position 4)

Let me verify: CHINO is a valid 5-letter English word and fits all constraints.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 3: CHINO -> FEEDBACK: C(x) H(x) I(✓) N(-) O(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s update the constraints based on the new feedback:

1. SLATE → S(x) L(x) A(x) T(x) E(x)  
   Eliminates: S, L, A, T, E

2. ROUND → R(x) O(-) U(x) N(-) D(x)  
   Eliminates: R, U, D  
   Confirms: O is in the word but NOT in position 2, N is in the word but NOT in position 4.

3. CHINO → C(x) H(x) I(✓) N(-) O(-)  
   Eliminates: C, H  
   Confirms: I is in the word and in position 3.  
   Also confirms N is in the word but NOT in position 4 (consistent with ROUND).  
   Also confirms O is in the word but NOT in position 4 (consistent with ROUND).

So the secret word:
- Has letters: I (fixed at position 3), O, N  
- Does NOT contain: S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D, C, H  
- O cannot be in positions 2 or 4  
- N cannot be in position 4  

Remaining allowed letters: B, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus O, N, I)

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has I in position 3  
- Has O and N somewhere else (positions 1, 3, 5 for O; positions 1, 2, 3, 5 for N, but 3 is already I)  
- Uses only allowed letters

Possible structure: _ _ I _ _ with O and N in the remaining slots.

Let’s look for words fitting _ _ I _ _ using allowed letters:

- O must be in position 1 or 5 (cannot be 2 or 4)  
- N must be in position 1, 2, or 5 (cannot be 4)  

Candidate words:
- BINO? (but B, I, N, O: BINO is 4 letters)  
- JI? Not helpful.  
- Looking at allowed letters, let’s try “MINOR” but R is eliminated.  
- “GIVEN” – E is eliminated.  
- “VINO” – too short.  
- “BINGO” – uses B, I, N, G, O: all letters allowed.  
  - B, I, N, G, O  
  - I is in position 3 (✓)  
  - O is in position 5 (allowed)  
  - N is in position 2 (allowed)  
  - B and G are new letters to test.  

“BINGO” seems valid and fits all constraints.

Let’s carefully extract what we now know after four guesses.

Letters that are **not** in the word (eliminated):
S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D, C, H, B, G

Letters that **are** in the word (confirmed):
- I (from CHINO: I(✓))
- N (from ROUND and CHINO: N(-) twice)
- O (from ROUND and CHINO: O(-) twice)

Positions ruled out so far:
- I cannot be in position 3 (from BINGO: I(-) means I is in the word but not in position 2)
Wait—let’s re-read the feedback carefully:

CHINO: C(x) H(x) I(✓) N(-) O(-)  
- I(✓) means I is in the word AND in position 3.

BINGO: B(x) I(-) N(-) G(x) O(-)  
- I(-) means I is in the word but **not** in position 2.  
  (This is consistent with I already known to be in position 3.)

- N(-) again means N is in the word but **not** in position 3.  
  (Previously we only knew N is not in position 4.)

- O(-) again means O is in the word but **not** in position 5.

So the confirmed letters are I (fixed at position 3), N, and O.  
Allowed positions:
- I is locked at position 3.
- N can be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (cannot be 3 or 4).
- O can be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 4), but 3 is already I, so O can be 1 or 5.

Allowed letters remaining (not yet eliminated):
F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus the confirmed I, N, O)

We need a 5-letter word of the form:
- _ _ I _ _ with N and O placed in the remaining slots, and all letters from the allowed set.

Possible structures:
1. O _ I N _ (O in 1, N in 4) – but N cannot be in 4 (from ROUND).  
2. O _ I _ N (O in 1, N in 5) – valid.
3. N _ I O _ (N in 1, O in 4) – but O cannot be in 4.  
4. N _ I _ O (N in 1, O in 5) – valid.
5. _ O I N _ – invalid (O in 2, N in 4).
6. _ N I O _ – invalid (O in 4).
7. _ O I _ N – valid (O in 2, N in 5) – but O cannot be in 2.
8. _ N I _ O – valid (N in 2, O in 5) – allowed.

So the only valid patterns are:
- O _ I _ N (O in 1, N in 5)
- N _ I _ O (N in 1, O in 5)
- _ N I _ O (N in 2, O in 5)

Let’s look for real 5-letter words fitting these patterns using remaining letters.

Pattern 1: O _ I _ N  
Need a letter in position 2 and 4 from allowed set {F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.  
Example: O F I K N → “OFIKN” – not a word.  
O P I K N – no.  
O M I K N – no.  
No common English words fit this pattern.

Pattern 2: N _ I _ O  
Same issue. No common words.

Pattern 3: _ N I _ O  
Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5  
- 3 is I.  
- 2 is N.  
- 5 is O.  
Need letters 1 and 4 from allowed set.  
Example: F N I K O – “FN IKO” – no.  
M N I K O – no.  
V N I K O – no.  
No common words.

Let’s list the remaining letters again: F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Another approach: maybe O is in position 1 and N in position 2.  
Word form: O N I _ _ – but then we need two more letters.  
But O is allowed in 1, N in 2, I in 3.  
Need letters 4 and 5 from remaining set.  
Example: O N I K F – “ONIKF” – no.  
O N I M P – “ONIMP” – no.  
No valid words.

Wait—let’s think of actual words that fit _ _ I _ _ with I in position 3, and include N and O somewhere else, using only allowed letters.

Possible words:
- MINOR – but R is eliminated.  
- PINKO – K and P are allowed, but O is in 5 (allowed), N in 2 (allowed).  
  Check letters: P, I, N, K, O – all allowed.  
  Check positions:  
  - I is in 3 (✓)  
  - N is in 2 (allowed)  
  - O is in 5 (allowed)  
  - P and K are new letters to test.  

“PINKO” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let me verify constraints:
- Letters used: P, I, N, K, O – none are in the eliminated list.  
- I is in position 3 (matches CHINO feedback).  
- N is in position 2 (allowed, since N cannot be in 3 or 4).  
- O is in position 5 (allowed, since O cannot be in 2 or 4).  

This seems correct.

<guess>PINKO</guess>",PINKO,"Let’s carefully extract what we now know after four guesses.

Letters that are **not** in the word (eliminated):
S, L, A, T, E, R, U, D, C, H, B, G

Letters that **are** in the word (confirmed):
- I (from CHINO: I(✓))
- N (from ROUND and CHINO: N(-) twice)
- O (from ROUND and CHINO: O(-) twice)

Positions ruled out so far:
- I cannot be in position 3 (from BINGO: I(-) means I is in the word but not in position 2)
Wait—let’s re-read the feedback carefully:

CHINO: C(x) H(x) I(✓) N(-) O(-)  
- I(✓) means I is in the word AND in position 3.

BINGO: B(x) I(-) N(-) G(x) O(-)  
- I(-) means I is in the word but **not** in position 2.  
  (This is consistent with I already known to be in position 3.)

- N(-) again means N is in the word but **not** in position 3.  
  (Previously we only knew N is not in position 4.)

- O(-) again means O is in the word but **not** in position 5.

So the confirmed letters are I (fixed at position 3), N, and O.  
Allowed positions:
- I is locked at position 3.
- N can be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (cannot be 3 or 4).
- O can be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (cannot be 2 or 4), but 3 is already I, so O can be 1 or 5.

Allowed letters remaining (not yet eliminated):
F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus the confirmed I, N, O)

We need a 5-letter word of the form:
- _ _ I _ _ with N and O placed in the remaining slots, and all letters from the allowed set.

Possible structures:
1. O _ I N _ (O in 1, N in 4) – but N cannot be in 4 (from ROUND).  
2. O _ I _ N (O in 1, N in 5) – valid.
3. N _ I O _ (N in 1, O in 4) – but O cannot be in 4.  
4. N _ I _ O (N in 1, O in 5) – valid.
5. _ O I N _ – invalid (O in 2, N in 4).
6. _ N I O _ – invalid (O in 4).
7. _ O I _ N – valid (O in 2, N in 5) – but O cannot be in 2.
8. _ N I _ O – valid (N in 2, O in 5) – allowed.

So the only valid patterns are:
- O _ I _ N (O in 1, N in 5)
- N _ I _ O (N in 1, O in 5)
- _ N I _ O (N in 2, O in 5)

Let’s look for real 5-letter words fitting these patterns using remaining letters.

Pattern 1: O _ I _ N  
Need a letter in position 2 and 4 from allowed set {F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}.  
Example: O F I K N → “OFIKN” – not a word.  
O P I K N – no.  
O M I K N – no.  
No common English words fit this pattern.

Pattern 2: N _ I _ O  
Same issue. No common words.

Pattern 3: _ N I _ O  
Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5  
- 3 is I.  
- 2 is N.  
- 5 is O.  
Need letters 1 and 4 from allowed set.  
Example: F N I K O – “FN IKO” – no.  
M N I K O – no.  
V N I K O – no.  
No common words.

Let’s list the remaining letters again: F, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Another approach: maybe O is in position 1 and N in position 2.  
Word form: O N I _ _ – but then we need two more letters.  
But O is allowed in 1, N in 2, I in 3.  
Need letters 4 and 5 from remaining set.  
Example: O N I K F – “ONIKF” – no.  
O N I M P – “ONIMP” – no.  
No valid words.

Wait—let’s think of actual words that fit _ _ I _ _ with I in position 3, and include N and O somewhere else, using only allowed letters.

Possible words:
- MINOR – but R is eliminated.  
- PINKO – K and P are allowed, but O is in 5 (allowed), N in 2 (allowed).  
  Check letters: P, I, N, K, O – all allowed.  
  Check positions:  
  - I is in 3 (✓)  
  - N is in 2 (allowed)  
  - O is in 5 (allowed)  
  - P and K are new letters to test.  

“PINKO” is a valid 5-letter word.

Let me verify constraints:
- Letters used: P, I, N, K, O – none are in the eliminated list.  
- I is in position 3 (matches CHINO feedback).  
- N is in position 2 (allowed, since N cannot be in 3 or 4).  
- O is in position 5 (allowed, since O cannot be in 2 or 4).  

This seems correct.",Guess 6: PINKO -> FEEDBACK: P(x) I(-) N(-) K(x) O(-),FAIL
