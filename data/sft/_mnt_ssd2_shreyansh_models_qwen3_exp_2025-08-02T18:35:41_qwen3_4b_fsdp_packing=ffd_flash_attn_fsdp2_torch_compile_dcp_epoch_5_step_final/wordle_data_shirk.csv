### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters in different positions. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants well. This should give us good feedback about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.

- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, S

We need a 5-letter word that:

Good candidates would use other common consonants and vowels. The remaining common vowels are I, U, and sometimes Y. Let’s try a word that uses R and S plus some of these other letters. A good choice is “CRISP”:
- C, I, P are new letters.
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since it can’t be in 2).
- S is in position 4 (but feedback said S is not in 4 – oops, conflict!). So CRISP is invalid because S would be in position 4.

- F, I, K are new letters.
- R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in 2 – conflict).

Next: “DRISY” – but Y is less common, and we don’t know if Y is allowed.

Let’s consolidate the new information from Guess 2 (URINS):

- U(x) – U is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(✓) – I is in the word AND in position 3.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E, U, N
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, S, I (with I fixed at position 3)
- R cannot be in position 2
- S cannot be in position 4 or 5
- I must be in position 3

Therefore, the word has the pattern:
_ _ I _ _

with remaining letters chosen from the unused alphabet excluding A, O, E, U, N. The unused common letters include: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to place R and S in the remaining positions (1, 2, 4) while respecting their constraints:
- R cannot be in position 2
- S cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (but 5 is already I, so only 4 is forbidden for S)

So possible positions:
- R could be in 1 or 4
- S could be in 1 or 2

Let’s try to construct a valid word:
Option 1: R in position 1, S in position 2 → R S I _ _
But then we still need two more letters. However, S cannot be in 4 or 5, and we already have S in 2, so positions 4 and 5 are open. But position 5 is already I, so position 4 is open. But S is in 2, so 4 is allowed. However, we need two more letters. This seems possible.

But let’s think of a valid word. For example, “RISKS” – but S is in 5, which is forbidden. “RISER” – but E is forbidden. “RISKS” again invalid. 

Another approach: Since I is fixed at 3, let’s look for words with I in 3, containing R and S, avoiding forbidden letters.

Possible words:
- “CRISP” – but P is allowed, but S is in 4 which is forbidden.
- “DRIPS” – S is in 5, forbidden.
- “GRIST” – S is in 4, forbidden.
- “PRISM” – S is in 5, forbidden.
- “TRISK” – S is in 4, forbidden.
- “BRISK” – S is in 4, forbidden.
- “FRISK” – S is in 4, forbidden.
- “DRIPS” – S is in 5, forbidden.
- “CRISP” – S is in 4, forbidden.
- “GRIPS” – S is in 5, forbidden.

Hmm, many common words have S in forbidden positions. Let’s try to find a word where:
- I is in 3
- R is in 1 or 4
- S is in 1 or 2
- No A, O, E, U, N

Possible candidates:
- “RISKS” – invalid (S in 5)
- “RISER” – invalid (E)
- “RISKS” – same
- “RISKS” – same
- “RISKS” – same

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe S is in 1 or 2, R is in 4, and we need two more letters.

For example:
- S _ I R _
- _ S I R _

But we need a valid word. Let’s try:
- “SPRIG” – but G is allowed, but S is in 1, P in 2, R in 4, I in 3, G in 5. But this has R in 4, which is allowed (R not in 2), and S in 1 (allowed), I in 3 (fixed), P and G are new letters not forbidden. This seems valid.

Check constraints:
- Letters: S, P, R, I, G
- Forbidden letters: A, O, E, U, N – none of these appear.
- I is in position 3 – correct.
- R is in 4 – allowed (not in 2)
- S is in 1 – allowed (not in 4 or 5)
- No conflicts.

“SPRIG” seems valid.

Another candidate: “SCRIP” – but S is in 1, C in 2, R in 4, I in 3, P in 5. This also fits all constraints.

Between SPRIG and SCRIP, let’s choose SPRIG.

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe S is in 1 or 2, R is in 4, and we need two more letters.

For example:
- S _ I R _
- _ S I R _

But we need a valid word. Let’s try:
- “SPRIG” – but G is allowed, but S is in 1, P in 2, R in 4, I in 3, G in 5. But this has R in 4, which is allowed (R not in 2), and S in 1 (allowed), I in 3 (fixed), P and G are new letters not forbidden. This seems valid.

Check constraints:
- Letters: S, P, R, I, G
- Forbidden letters: A, O, E, U, N – none of these appear.
- I is in position 3 – correct.
- R is in 4 – allowed (not in 2)
- S is in 1 – allowed (not in 4 or 5)
- No conflicts.

“SPRIG” seems valid.

Another candidate: “SCRIP” – but S is in 1, C in 2, R in 4, I in 3, P in 5. This also fits all constraints.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters in different positions. The word ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong first guess because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers vowels and consonants well. This should give us good feedback about which letters are in the word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, S
- R is not in position 2
- S is not in position 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both R and S
- Does NOT contain A, O, or E
- R is not in position 2
- S is not in position 4

Good candidates would use other common consonants and vowels. The remaining common vowels are I, U, and sometimes Y. Let’s try a word that uses R and S plus some of these other letters. A good choice is “CRISP”:
- C, I, P are new letters.
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since it can’t be in 2).
- S is in position 4 (but feedback said S is not in 4 – oops, conflict!). So CRISP is invalid because S would be in position 4.

Next candidate: “FRISK”
- F, I, K are new letters.
- R is in position 2 (but feedback says R is not in 2 – conflict).

Next: “DRISY” – but Y is less common, and we don’t know if Y is allowed.

Next: “TRISK” – T, R, I, S, K. R is in 2 (conflict again).

Next: “GRIST”
- G, I, T are new letters.
- R is in 3 (allowed).
- S is in 4 (conflict – feedback says S is not in 4).

Next: “PRISM”
- P, I, M are new letters.
- R is in 2 (conflict).

Next: “URINS”
- U, I, N are new letters.
- R is in 3 (allowed).
- S is in 5 (allowed).
- No A, O, E – good.

“URINS” looks valid:
- Contains R and S.
- No A, O, E.
- R is in 3 (allowed).
- S is in 5 (allowed).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Guess 2: URINS -> FEEDBACK: U(x) R(-) I(✓) N(x) S(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let’s consolidate the new information from Guess 2 (URINS):

- U(x) – U is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(✓) – I is in the word AND in position 3.
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E, U, N
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, S, I (with I fixed at position 3)
- R cannot be in position 2
- S cannot be in position 4 or 5
- I must be in position 3

Therefore, the word has the pattern:
_ _ I _ _

with remaining letters chosen from the unused alphabet excluding A, O, E, U, N. The unused common letters include: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to place R and S in the remaining positions (1, 2, 4) while respecting their constraints:
- R cannot be in position 2
- S cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (but 5 is already I, so only 4 is forbidden for S)

So possible positions:
- R could be in 1 or 4
- S could be in 1 or 2

Let’s try to construct a valid word:
Option 1: R in position 1, S in position 2 → R S I _ _
But then we still need two more letters. However, S cannot be in 4 or 5, and we already have S in 2, so positions 4 and 5 are open. But position 5 is already I, so position 4 is open. But S is in 2, so 4 is allowed. However, we need two more letters. This seems possible.

But let’s think of a valid word. For example, “RISKS” – but S is in 5, which is forbidden. “RISER” – but E is forbidden. “RISKS” again invalid. 

Another approach: Since I is fixed at 3, let’s look for words with I in 3, containing R and S, avoiding forbidden letters.

Possible words:
- “CRISP” – but P is allowed, but S is in 4 which is forbidden.
- “DRIPS” – S is in 5, forbidden.
- “GRIST” – S is in 4, forbidden.
- “PRISM” – S is in 5, forbidden.
- “TRISK” – S is in 4, forbidden.
- “BRISK” – S is in 4, forbidden.
- “FRISK” – S is in 4, forbidden.
- “DRIPS” – S is in 5, forbidden.
- “CRISP” – S is in 4, forbidden.
- “GRIPS” – S is in 5, forbidden.

Hmm, many common words have S in forbidden positions. Let’s try to find a word where:
- I is in 3
- R is in 1 or 4
- S is in 1 or 2
- No A, O, E, U, N

Possible candidates:
- “RISKS” – invalid (S in 5)
- “RISER” – invalid (E)
- “RISKS” – same
- “RISKS” – same
- “RISKS” – same

Wait, let’s think differently. Maybe S is in 1 or 2, R is in 4, and we need two more letters.

For example:
- S _ I R _
- _ S I R _

But we need a valid word. Let’s try:
- “SPRIG” – but G is allowed, but S is in 1, P in 2, R in 4, I in 3, G in 5. But this has R in 4, which is allowed (R not in 2), and S in 1 (allowed), I in 3 (fixed), P and G are new letters not forbidden. This seems valid.

Check constraints:
- Letters: S, P, R, I, G
- Forbidden letters: A, O, E, U, N – none of these appear.
- I is in position 3 – correct.
- R is in 4 – allowed (not in 2)
- S is in 1 – allowed (not in 4 or 5)
- No conflicts.

“SPRIG” seems valid.

Another candidate: “SCRIP” – but S is in 1, C in 2, R in 4, I in 3, P in 5. This also fits all constraints.

Between SPRIG and SCRIP, let’s choose SPRIG.

Let’s update the constraints from all feedback so far:

Known facts
1. Letters NOT in the word: A, O, E, U, N, P, G
2. Letters that ARE in the word: S, R, I
   - S is in the word and in position 1 (✓)
   - I is in the word but NOT in position 3 (feedback says I(-))
   - R is in the word but NOT in position 2 or 4 (from URINS and SPRIG)

So the word must be:
S _ _ _ _  (S fixed at position 1)
and contain R and I somewhere in positions 2,3,4,5, with:
- R not in 2 or 4
- I not in 3

Also, no A, O, E, U, N, P, G may appear.

Remaining possible letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to place:
- R in one of positions 3 or 5 (since 2 and 4 are forbidden)
- I in one of positions 2,4,5 (since 3 is forbidden)

Possible patterns:
Case 1: R in 3
S _ R _ _
   I must go in 2 or 5
   - If I in 2: S I R _ _ → need two more letters from allowed set
   - If I in 5: S _ R _ I → need two more letters from allowed set

Case 2: R in 5
S _ _ _ R
   I must go in 2 or 4
   - If I in 2: S I _ _ R → need two more letters from allowed set
   - If I in 4: S _ _ I R → need two more letters from allowed set

Let’s look for valid English words that fit these patterns.

Case 1: R in 3
- S I R _ _ : ""SIRKS"" – but K is allowed, S is in 1 (fixed), I in 2, R in 3, S in 4 and 5 – but S is already in 1, and we can’t have S in 4 and 5 because we only have one S. Also, S in 4 would duplicate S in 1, which is allowed, but ""SIRKS"" has S in 4 and 5 which would be two S’s – but we have no info on duplicates, but it’s unlikely. Also, K is allowed, but this seems less likely.
- S _ R _ I : ""STRII"" – invalid. ""STRIP"" – but P is forbidden. ""STRIK"" – K is allowed, but ""STRIK"" isn’t a word. ""STRIE"" – E is forbidden. ""STRIY"" – not common. ""STRIH"" – not a word.

Case 2: R in 5
- S I _ _ R : ""S I _ _ R"" – possible words: ""SILKR"" – but L is allowed, K is allowed, but ""SILKR"" isn’t a common word. ""SILVER"" – too long. ""SILKR"" is obscure.
- S _ _ I R : ""S _ _ I R"" – possible words: ""SKIRL"" – not a word. ""SKIRM"" – M is allowed, but ""SKIRM"" isn’t common. ""SKIRT"" – T is allowed, this is a valid word.

""SKIRT"" fits:
- S in 1 (✓)
- K, I, R, T – all letters are allowed (not in forbidden list)
- R is in 5 – allowed (not in 2 or 4)
- I is in 4 – allowed (not in 3)
- No forbidden letters.

Let’s check:
Letters: S, K, I, R, T
Forbidden list: A, O, E, U, N, P, G – none appear.
Positions:
1: S ✓
2: K – allowed
3: I – allowed (not in 3, but in 4 here)
4: R – allowed (not in 2 or 4, but in 4 here – wait, R is not allowed in 4! From SPRIG feedback R(-) means R is not in 4. So R in 5 is allowed, but in SKIRT R is in 4 – which is forbidden. Oops!

So ""SKIRT"" is invalid because R would be in 4.

Back to drawing board.

Case 2: R in 5
- S _ _ I R : R is in 5, I in 4 – allowed.
Need two letters for positions 2 and 3 from allowed set.

Possible combinations:
- S B _ I R – ""SBIR_"" – not a word.
- S C _ I R – ""SCIR_"" – not a word.
- S T _ I R – ""STIR_"" – ""STIR"" plus a letter. ""STIR"" is 4 letters. ""STIRK"" – K allowed, but 5 letters. ""STIRK"" – not a word.
- S H _ I R – ""SHIR_"" – ""SHIR"" plus a letter. ""SHIRK"" – K allowed, this is a valid word.

""SHIRK"":
- S in 1 (✓)
- H – allowed
- I – in 4 (allowed)
- R – in 5 (allowed)
- K – allowed
- No forbidden letters.
- R is in 5 – allowed (not in 2 or 4)
- I is in 4 – allowed (not in 3)

This fits all constraints.

Possible combinations:
- S B _ I R – ""SBIR_"" – not a word.
- S C _ I R – ""SCIR_"" – not a word.
- S T _ I R – ""STIR_"" – ""STIR"" plus a letter. ""STIR"" is 4 letters. ""STIRK"" – K allowed, but 5 letters. ""STIRK"" – not a word.
- S H _ I R – ""SHIR_"" – ""SHIR"" plus a letter. ""SHIRK"" – K allowed, this is a valid word.

""SHIRK"":
- S in 1 (✓)
- H – allowed
- I – in 4 (allowed)
- R – in 5 (allowed)
- K – allowed
- No forbidden letters.
- R is in 5 – allowed (not in 2 or 4)
- I is in 4 – allowed (not in 3)

This fits all constraints.

Another candidate: ""S W I R R"" – but double R and W is allowed, but ""SWIRR"" isn't a common word.

""SHIRK"" seems the best valid word.",Guess 4: SHIRK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(✓) I(✓) R(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
