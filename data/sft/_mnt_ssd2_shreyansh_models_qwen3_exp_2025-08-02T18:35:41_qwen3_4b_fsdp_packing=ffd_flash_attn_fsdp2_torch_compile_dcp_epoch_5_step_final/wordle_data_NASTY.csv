For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters to quickly narrow down the possibilities.

One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives us good coverage for vowels and common consonants. This should provide strong feedback for our next guesses.

From the feedback on “arose”:

- R is not in the word at all.
- O is not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S is somewhere other than position 4).
- E is not in the word at all.

So far we know:
- The word contains A and S, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively.
- The word does NOT contain R, O, or E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and S.
2. Does NOT contain R, O, or E.

Good vowels left to try: I, U (since A is already confirmed).

Let’s try a word that uses A and S in new positions and introduces new common consonants. A good candidate is “STAIN”:
- S in position 1 (new position, since S was in 4 before).
- T, A, I, N are all new letters.
- No R, O, E.

This should give us good information about S, A, T, I, N.

Summary of what we know:
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: R, O, E, I
- Letters definitely IN the word (but positions unknown): A, S, T, N
- Position constraints so far:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 3.
  – S cannot be in positions 1 or 4.
  – T cannot be in position 2.
  – N cannot be in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A, S, T, N (each at least once).
2. Does NOT contain R, O, E, I.
3. Respects the positional bans above.

Looking at the remaining letters, we have:
Vowels left: A (confirmed), plus U (common but untested).
Consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to place A, S, T, N plus one more letter (must be from the remaining consonants or U).

Let’s try to build a word that uses these letters while obeying the positional constraints.

One promising candidate is “SANTU”:
- S in position 1 (allowed, since S was banned from 4 only).
- A in position 2 (allowed, since A was banned from 1 and 3).
- N in position 3 (allowed, since N was banned from 5).
- T in position 4 (allowed, since T was banned from 2).
- U in position 5 (new letter, untested).

This uses all four confirmed letters (A, S, T, N) plus a new vowel U, and respects all positional bans.

Let’s check:
- Contains A, S, T, N → yes.
- Does NOT contain R, O, E, I → yes.
- Positional constraints:
  – A not in 1 or 3 → it’s in 2 → ok.

From the three rounds of feedback we have:

Round 1: arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
Round 2: stain → S(-) T(-) A(-) I(x) N(-)
Round 3: santu → S(-) A(✓) N(-) T(✓) U(x)

What we now know for sure:

1. Letters NOT in the word: R, O, E, I, U
2. Letters definitely IN the word and their correct positions:
   - A is in position 2 (✓)
   - T is in position 4 (✓)
3. Letters that are in the word but whose exact positions are still unknown (because the feedback only showed “-” for them in earlier guesses):
   - S (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 1, 4, or 5)
   - N (must appear somewhere, but not in positions 3 or 5)

So the pattern so far is:
_ A _ T _   (positions 2 and 4 fixed)

We need to place S and N in the remaining slots (positions 1, 3, 5) while respecting the positional bans:

- S cannot be in 1, 4, or 5 → only possible in position 3.
- N cannot be in 3 or 5 → only possible in position 1 or 5.

But position 3 is now taken by S, so N must be in position 1 or 5.

Let’s list the possibilities:

Pattern: _ A S T _   (S in 3, T in 4, A in 2)

Then N must be in position 1 or 5.

- If N is in 1: N A S T _ → need a 5th letter for position 5. Allowed letters (not R,O,E,I,U): B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z. Let’s pick a common consonant like D: N A S T D → “nastd” is not a valid word.
- If N is in 5: _ A S T N → need a 1st letter. Again, from allowed consonants: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z. Let’s try B: B A S T N → “bastn” is not a valid word. Try C: C A S T N → “castn” not valid. Try L: L A S T N → “lastn” not valid. Try M: M A S T N → “mastn” not valid. Try P: P A S T N → “pastn” not valid. Try S: already used. Try T: already used. Try N: already used. Try D: D A S T N → “dastn” not valid. Try G: G A S T N → “gastn” not valid. Try H: H A S T N → “hastn” not valid. Try K: K A S T N → “kastn” not valid. Try V: V A S T N → “vastn” not valid. Try W: W A S T N → “wastn” not valid. Try Y: Y A S T N → “yastn” not valid. Try Z: Z A S T N → “zastn” not valid.

Hmm, none of these seem to be valid English words. Maybe we need to use a different 5th letter.

Looking back, we have not used vowels yet except A. The only other vowel left is U, but U is already ruled out (U(x) in round 3). So we must use consonants.

Wait, let me re-examine the constraints:

We have:
- A in 2
- T in 4
- S must be in 3 (only remaining spot)
- N must be in 1 or 5
- The 5th letter must be a consonant not yet used (not R,O,E,I,U)

So the two possible patterns are:
1. N A S T _ → need a consonant for 5
2. _ A S T N → need a consonant for 1

Let me think of valid words that fit these patterns.

1. N A S T _ → “nast_” words: “nast” + consonant. “nast” is a prefix, but “nast” + “y” = “nasty” (but Y is sometimes vowel). However, “nasty” is 5 letters but has Y which is allowed. But Y is sometimes vowel, sometimes consonant. Let me check if “nasty” is valid. Yes, “nasty” is a valid English word. But let’s see if it fits all constraints:
   - N A S T Y
   - Letters used: N, A, S, T, Y
   - Y is allowed (not ruled out)
   - Positions:
     - N in 1: allowed (only banned in 3,5)
     - A in 2: correct
     - S in 3: allowed (only banned in 1,4,5)
     - T in 4: correct
     - Y in 5: allowed
   - No forbidden letters: R,O,E,I,U
   - So “nasty” seems valid.

2. _ A S T N → need a consonant for 1. Let me think of consonants that make valid words:
   - B A S T N → “bastn” not valid
   - C A S T N → “castn” not valid
   - D A S T N → “dastn” not valid
   - F A S T N → “fastn” not valid
   - G A S T N → “gastn” not valid
   - H A S T N → “hastn” not valid
   - J A S T N → “jastn” not valid
   - K A S T N → “kastn” not valid
   - L A S T N → “lastn” not valid
   - M A S T N → “mastn” not valid
   - P A S T N → “pastn” not valid
   - Q A S T N → “qastn” not valid
   - V A S T N → “vastn” not valid
   - W A S T N → “wastn” not valid
   - X A S T N → “xastn” not valid
   - Y A S T N → “yastn” not valid
   - Z A S T N → “zastn” not valid

None of these seem to be valid words. So the only valid word fitting the constraints seems to be “nasty”.

But let me double-check if I missed any letters. The remaining letters not ruled out are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And the pattern N A S T _ gives “nasty” which is valid.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “nasty”.
</think>

Based on the feedback so far:
- A is locked in position 2.
- T is locked in position 4.
- S must appear somewhere but cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5 → only possible in position 3.
- N must appear somewhere but cannot be in positions 3 or 5 → only possible in position 1 or 5.
- U, I, O, E, R are ruled out.

The only valid word that fits these constraints is:

Let’s list the possibilities:

Pattern: _ A S T _   (S in 3, T in 4, A in 2)

Then N must be in position 1 or 5.

- If N is in 1: N A S T _ → need a 5th letter for position 5. Allowed letters (not R,O,E,I,U): B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z. Let’s pick a common consonant like D: N A S T D → “nastd” is not a valid word.

   - Y is allowed (not ruled out)
   - Positions:
     - N in 1: allowed (only banned in 3,5)
     - A in 2: correct
     - S in 3: allowed (only banned in 1,4,5)
     - T in 4: correct
     - Y in 5: allowed
   - No forbidden letters: R,O,E,I,U
   - So “nasty” seems valid.

2. _ A S T N → need a consonant for 1. Let me think of consonants that make valid words:
   - B A S T N → “bastn” not valid
   - C A S T N → “castn” not valid
   - D A S T N → “dastn” not valid
   - F A S T N → “fastn” not valid

   - V A S T N → “vastn” not valid
   - W A S T N → “wastn” not valid
   - X A S T N → “xastn” not valid
   - Y A S T N → “yastn” not valid
   - Z A S T N → “zastn” not valid

None of these seem to be valid words. So the only valid word fitting the constraints seems to be “nasty”.

But let me double-check if I missed any letters. The remaining letters not ruled out are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And the pattern N A S T _ gives “nasty” which is valid.

Therefore, the next logical guess is “nasty”.Based on the feedback so far:
- A is locked in position 2.
- T is locked in position 4.
- S must appear somewhere but cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 5 → only possible in position 3.
- N must appear somewhere but cannot be in positions 3 or 5 → only possible in position 1 or 5.
- U, I, O, E, R are ruled out.

The only valid word that fits these constraints is:",Guess 4: nasty -> FEEDBACK: N(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
