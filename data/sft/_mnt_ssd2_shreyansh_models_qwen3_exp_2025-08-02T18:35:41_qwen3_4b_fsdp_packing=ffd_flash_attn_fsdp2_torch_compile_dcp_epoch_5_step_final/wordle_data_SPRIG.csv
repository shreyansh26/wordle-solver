### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the information gained. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants like R, T, N, S, L, etc. 

Some popular starting words are:
- SLATE (contains S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (contains C, R, A, N, E)
- ADIEU (contains A, D, I, E, U - but has two vowels)
- RAISE (contains R, A, I, S, E)

I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it includes:
- C (common consonant)
- R (very common)
- A (most common vowel)
- N (common)
- E (most common vowel)

This should give us good coverage of common letters and help narrow down possibilities quickly.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: x → not in the word at all  
- R: - → in the word but not in position 2  
- A: x → not in the word at all  
- N: x → not in the word at all  
- E: x → not in the word at all  

So the secret word:
- does NOT contain C, A, N, or E  
- does contain R, but not in position 2  

Letters we can still use: R (somewhere other than position 2), and the rest of the alphabet except C, A, N, E.

To maximize information on the next guess, I want a word that:
1. Places R in a new position (1, 3, 4, or 5)  
2. Uses other common letters we haven’t ruled out (like S, T, L, I, O, U, D, etc.)  
3. Avoids any of the ruled-out letters (C, A, N, E)

A good candidate is “ROUND”:
- R is now in position 1 (new placement)  
- O, U, N, D are all new letters we haven’t tested yet  
- It avoids C, A, E, N (wait, N is ruled out! So ROUND is bad because it has N).  
Let me pick another word.

“STORY”:
- S, T, O, R, Y  
- R is in position 4 (new placement)  
- No C, A, N, E  
- Uses common letters S, T, O, Y

This seems optimal.

From the two guesses so far:

CRANE → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
STORY → S(✓) T(x) O(x) R(-) Y(x)

What we know:
1. Letters NOT in the word: C, A, N, E, T, O, Y  
2. Letters that ARE in the word:
   - S is in position 1 (✓)
   - R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 4 (from CRANE and STORY feedback)

So the word looks like: S _ _ _ _

Remaining unused common letters (excluding the ruled-out ones): B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word starting with S, containing R somewhere (positions 3, 5), and using only the still-allowed letters.

Possible patterns:
- S R _ _ _  (R in position 2 – but R is already known NOT to be in position 2 from CRANE feedback, so this is invalid)
- S _ R _ _  (R in position 3)
- S _ _ R _  (R in position 4 – but R is NOT in position 4 from STORY feedback, so invalid)
- S _ _ _ R  (R in position 5)

Thus, R must be in position 3 or 5.

Let’s try R in position 3: S _ R _ _
Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, X, Z

Looking for 5-letter words fitting S _ R _ _:
- S B R E D – but E is ruled out
- S P R I N – N is ruled out
- S H R I N – N is ruled out
- S P R I T – T is ruled out
- S P R U N – N is ruled out
- S P R U D – valid letters: S, P, R, U, D
- S P R U C – C is ruled out
- S P R I N – N is ruled out
- S P R I G – G is allowed, I is allowed
- S P R I K – K is allowed
- S P R I M – M is allowed
- S P R I D – D is allowed
- S P R I B – B is allowed

""SPRIG"" seems like a good candidate:

- R is in position 3 (new position not yet tested)

Let’s verify:
