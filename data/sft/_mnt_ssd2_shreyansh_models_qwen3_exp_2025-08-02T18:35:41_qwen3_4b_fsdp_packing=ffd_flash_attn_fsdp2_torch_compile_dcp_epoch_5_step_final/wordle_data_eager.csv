### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that has common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. 

Common starting words often include:
- Words with multiple vowels (like ""AUDIO"", ""AROSE"")
- Words with common consonants (like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"")

I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- These letters appear frequently in English words, giving good coverage for the first guess.

So far we have:

- Must not contain O, S, L, Y.  
- Remaining letters to test: D, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, T, U, W, etc.

A good next guess should place R in a new spot and test new consonants.  
Possible positions for R: 3, 4, or 5 (but 3 is already excluded by EARLY feedback).  
Let’s try R in position 4 and test a new consonant set.

A strong candidate is “EARTH”:

From all feedback so far:

1. AROSE → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – A, R, E are in the word but not in their original positions.

2. EARLY → E(✓) A(✓) R(-) L(x) Y(x)  
   – E is fixed in position 1.  
   – A is fixed in position 2.  
   – R is still in the word but not in position 3.

3. EARTH → E(✓) A(✓) R(-) T(x) H(x)  
   – Confirms E and A in positions 1 and 2.  
   – R is still in the word but not in position 3 or 4.  
   – T and H are absent.

So the word must be:
- E A _ _ _
- Must contain R in position 5 (only remaining spot for R).
- Cannot contain O, S, L, Y, T, H.

Letters still allowed (excluding O, S, L, Y, T, H):  
B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

We need two more letters for positions 3 and 4.  
Good consonant pairs to test: D & G, N & D, etc.

A strong candidate is “EAGLE” but L is banned.  
Next: “EARDY” – Y is banned.  
“EARED” – D is allowed, but E is already used.  
“EAGER” – G is allowed, R in 5.  
“EAGLE” – L banned.  
“EAMEN” – M and N are allowed.  
“EAFED” – F and D allowed.

Let’s choose “EAGER”:
- E A G E R  
- R in position 5 (required).  
- G is new.  
- E in 4 is redundant but acceptable.  
- Avoids all banned letters.

However, “EAGER” repeats E, which is allowed but not optimal.  
Better: “EAMEN” uses M and N.  
But M and N are both consonants, and we want to test vowels too.  
“EAVES” – S banned.  
“EAVY” – Y banned.  
“EAGLE” – L banned.  
“EARED” – D allowed, but repeats E.

A balanced choice: “EAGLE” is invalid.  
Next: “EAMEN” – M and N.  
But “EAMEN” is not a common word.

A more common word: “EAGLE” is invalid.  
“EARED” – acceptable.  
“EARED” fits: E A R E D, but D is allowed and R is in 3 – conflict.

Wait, R must be in 5.  
So pattern: E A _ _ R.

Letters for 3 and 4: from allowed set, no O, S, L, Y, T, H.

Possible: E A D G R – “EADGR” invalid.  
E A N G R – “EANGR” invalid.  
E A M B R – “EAMBR” invalid.  
E A N D R – “EANDR” invalid.  
E A N K R – “EANKR” invalid.

E A N P R – “EANPR” invalid.  
E A M D R – “EAMDR” invalid.  
E A M B R – “EAMBR” invalid.  
E A M N R – “EAMNR” invalid.

We need valid English words.  
Valid words with pattern E A _ _ R:

- EAGLE – L banned.  
- EARED – E A R E D – R in 3, invalid.  
- EAGER – E A G E R – R in 5, valid.  
- EAGLE – L banned.  
- EAMEN – M and N, but “EAMEN” is obscure.  
- EAPID – I and P, but “EAPID” is obscure.  
- EARED – invalid position for R.  
- EAGER – common word, R in 5, G new, E in 4 allowed.

“EAGER” is the best valid common word fitting constraints.
