### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify or eliminate vowels quickly
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, which is optimal for gathering information

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word and provides strong feedback for subsequent guesses.

- We need two more letters (positions 1/2 and 5) that are not A, O, T, I and are not already used.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s try S in position 1: S _ R E _
Need a letter for position 2 that’s allowed and a letter for position 5 that’s allowed.

Let’s pick a common consonant for position 2: N
Then position 5: need a letter not used yet and not forbidden. Let’s try N again? No, can’t repeat. Try D.

So: S N R E D
Check: S N R E D – valid 5-letter word?

Yes, ""snred"" is not valid. Let me think of a valid word.

Alternative: S P R E D – ""spread"" – but has A which is forbidden.

Alternative: S C R E D – ""scared"" – has A which is forbidden.

Alternative: S H R E D – ""shred"" – valid word.

Check letters: S, H, R, E, D
- No A, O, T, I – good
- E is in position 4 – correct
- R is in position 3 – allowed (R≠1,2)
- S is in position 1 – allowed (S≠4,5)
- H and D are new and allowed.

So ""shred"" seems valid.

The only common letter that fits is N, forming ""SHREN"" – but that’s not a word. Let me check valid words starting with SHRE:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. Common starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""AROSE"", or ""ADIEU"". 

Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it includes:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E) which helps identify or eliminate vowels quickly
- 2 common consonants (R, S)
- No repeated letters, which is optimal for gathering information

This gives us a good chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word and provides strong feedback for subsequent guesses.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(-) – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) – O is not in the word.
- S(-) – S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(-) – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters present: R, S, E
- Letters absent: A, O
- Positions to avoid: R≠2, S≠4, E≠5

We need a word that:
- Contains R, S, E
- Does NOT contain A or O
- Has R not in position 2, S not in position 4, E not in position 5

Let’s try “TRIES”:
- T is new, so we’re testing T
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since R≠2)
- I is new
- E is in position 3 (allowed, since E≠5)
- S is in position 5 (allowed, since S≠4)

This tests T and I while keeping the known letters in allowed positions.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - Letters present: R, S, E
   - Letters absent: A, O
   - Positions to avoid: R≠2, S≠4, E≠5

2. tries → T(x) R(-) I(x) E(✓) S(-)
   - Letters present: R, S, E (confirmed again)
   - Letters absent: T, I
   - New positional info:
     - E is in position 4 (✓)
     - R is in the word but not in positions 2 or 1 (from tries: R is in position 1, but feedback says R(-), meaning R is not in position 1, so R≠1 and R≠2)
     - S is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5 (from arose: S≠4; from tries: S≠5), so S must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

So far we know:
- Word has R, S, E
- E is fixed in position 4
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 2
- S cannot be in positions 4 or 5
- Letters absent: A, O, T, I

Possible positions:
- Position 4: E
- R must be in position 3 or 5 (but 5 is possible for R)
- S must be in position 1, 2, or 3

Let’s try to construct a word:
- Position 4: E
- Let’s try R in position 3: _ _ R E _
- Then S must be in position 1 or 2: S _ R E _ or _ S R E _
- We need two more letters (positions 1/2 and 5) that are not A, O, T, I and are not already used.

Possible letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let’s try S in position 1: S _ R E _
Need a letter for position 2 that’s allowed and a letter for position 5 that’s allowed.

Let’s pick a common consonant for position 2: N
Then position 5: need a letter not used yet and not forbidden. Let’s try N again? No, can’t repeat. Try D.

So: S N R E D
Check: S N R E D – valid 5-letter word?

Yes, ""snred"" is not valid. Let me think of a valid word.

Alternative: S P R E D – ""spread"" – but has A which is forbidden.

Alternative: S C R E D – ""scared"" – has A which is forbidden.

Alternative: S H R E D – ""shred"" – valid word.

Check letters: S, H, R, E, D
- No A, O, T, I – good
- E is in position 4 – correct
- R is in position 3 – allowed (R≠1,2)
- S is in position 1 – allowed (S≠4,5)
- H and D are new and allowed.

So ""shred"" seems valid.

From the four rounds we now know:

1. arose → A(x) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(-)
   - R, S, E are in the word; A, O are absent.
   - R ≠ 2, S ≠ 4, E ≠ 5.

2. tries → T(x) R(-) I(x) E(✓) S(-)
   - E is in position 4 (✓).
   - R ≠ 1,2; S ≠ 5.

3. shred → S(✓) H(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(x)
   - S is in position 1 (✓).
   - H is in position 2 (✓).
   - R is in position 3 (✓).
   - E is in position 4 (✓).
   - D is not in the word (x).

4. shrek → S(✓) H(✓) R(✓) E(✓) K(x)
   - Confirms the first four letters are S H R E _.
   - K is not in the word (x).

So the word must be S H R E _ with the final letter being any letter that has not been ruled out.  
Letters already ruled out: A, O, T, I, D, K.  
Remaining possibilities: B, C, F, G, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The only common 5-letter word that starts with SHRE is:

SHREN – invalid  
SHREL – invalid  
SHREW – valid (past tense of ""to shrew"")

Checking letters: S, H, R, E, W  
- W has not been tested and is allowed.

Therefore, the final guess is:

<guess>shrew</guess>
