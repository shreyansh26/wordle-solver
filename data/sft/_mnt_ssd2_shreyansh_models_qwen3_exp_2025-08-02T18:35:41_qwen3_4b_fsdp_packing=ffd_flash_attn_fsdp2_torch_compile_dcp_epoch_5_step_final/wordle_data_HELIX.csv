For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", etc. 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E (good mix of consonants and vowels)
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E (similar)
- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U (many vowels)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a strong starting word that covers common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities early on.

From the feedback:
- C, R, A, N are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word does NOT contain C, R, A, N.
2. The word DOES contain E, but not in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has an E somewhere other than the last letter.
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, N.

Good letters to try next (since they're common and haven't been ruled out): S, T, L, O, D, I, U, M, P, etc.

A strong second guess would be one that:
- Places E in a new position (positions 1-4).
- Introduces several new high-frequency consonants.

Possible candidates:
- STOLE (but O is okay, L is okay, S and T are good)
- SPLIT (but P is okay, L is okay, S and T are good)
- MOUTH (but H is less common)
- STOIC (but C is ruled out)

- Introduces new common consonants.

- E is now confirmed in position 2.

- G and D are NOT in the word.

Letters we know:
- Must be in the word: E, L, I (locked in positions 2, 3, 4).  
- Must NOT be in the word: C, R, A, N, S, T, O, G, D.

So the word has the pattern: _ E L I _.

Remaining letters that are still allowed (common ones): B, F, H, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 2.  
2. Has L in position 3.  
3. Has I in position 4.  
4. Uses only letters not yet eliminated.  
5. Has the remaining two letters (positions 1 and 5) from the still-allowed set.

Candidate words:
- B E L I _ : BELIE (but E is already used in position 2, and we don’t know if E repeats).  
- F E L I _ : FELIX (X not yet ruled out).  
- H E L I _ : HELIX (X again).

The clearest candidate is “FELIX” or “HELIX”, but X hasn’t been tested yet.  
Another is “MELIF” (but F is less common).  
“BELIE” is possible but repeats E.  
“VELIX” and “WELIX” are less common.

I’ll choose “FELIX” because X is a common letter in English and hasn’t been eliminated.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information gain. Good starting words often include vowels and frequently used consonants. Some popular choices are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", etc. 

Looking at these options:
- SLATE: S, L, A, T, E (good mix of consonants and vowels)
- CRANE: C, R, A, N, E (similar)
- ADIEU: A, D, I, E, U (many vowels)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a strong starting word that covers common letters and can help eliminate or confirm many possibilities early on.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback:
- C, R, A, N are all NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we know:
1. The word does NOT contain C, R, A, N.
2. The word DOES contain E, but not in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has an E somewhere other than the last letter.
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, N.

Good letters to try next (since they're common and haven't been ruled out): S, T, L, O, D, I, U, M, P, etc.

A strong second guess would be one that:
- Places E in a new position (positions 1-4).
- Introduces several new high-frequency consonants.

Possible candidates:
- STOLE (but O is okay, L is okay, S and T are good)
- SPLIT (but P is okay, L is okay, S and T are good)
- MOUTH (but H is less common)
- STOIC (but C is ruled out)

I'll go with ""STOLE"" because:
- S, T, O, L are all new and common.
- E is moved to position 4 (not ruled out).

Guess 2: STOLE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) L(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
   – Eliminates C, R, A, N.  
   – Confirms E exists, but NOT in position 5.

2. STOLE → S(x) T(x) O(x) L(-) E(-)  
   – Eliminates S, T, O.  
   – Confirms L exists, but NOT in position 4.  
   – Confirms E exists, but NOT in position 5 (reinforced).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, S, T, O.  
- Letters that ARE in the word: E, L.  
- Positions ruled out for E: 5; for L: 4.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both E and L.  
- Does NOT contain C, R, A, N, S, T, O.  
- E must be in positions 1–4.  
- L must be in positions 1–3 or 5.

Good remaining consonants to try: D, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, V, W, Y, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: I, U, Y (E is already confirmed).

Let’s pick a word that:
- Uses E and L.  
- Introduces new common consonants.  
- Places E and L in still-allowed positions.

Candidate words:
- BLEEP – uses B, L, E, E, P; but has E in position 4 (allowed) and L in position 2 (allowed).  
- MELON – but N is already eliminated.  
- VELVET – but V is repeated and we don’t know about V yet.  
- DUEL? – too short.  
- GELID – uses G, E, L, I, D.  
- PILED – uses P, I, L, E, D.

I’ll choose “GELID” because:
- It contains both E and L.  
- It introduces G, I, D (all new).  
- E is in position 2 (allowed).  
- L is in position 3 (allowed).
