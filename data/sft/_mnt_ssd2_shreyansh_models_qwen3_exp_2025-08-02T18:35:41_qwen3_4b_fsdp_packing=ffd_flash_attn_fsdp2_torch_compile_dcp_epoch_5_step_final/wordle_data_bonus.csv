For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which aren't. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it's a strong opening word that uses common letters in strategic positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 3rd).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 4th).
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: O, S (but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O and S.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, or E.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and E are out, and O is already confirmed).

Let’s try to place O and S in new positions while adding new common letters.

Possible positions:
- O could be 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th.
- S could be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.

Let’s try ""POINT"":
- P (new), O (in 2nd, not 3rd), I (new), N (new), T (new)
- Contains O and S? No S, so this is invalid.

Next try ""SOILS"":
- S (1st, not 4th), O (2nd, not 3rd), I (new), L (new), S (5th)
- Contains S and O, and avoids A, R, E.
- But has two S’s – not ideal.

Next try ""SPOIL"":
- S (1st), P (new), O (3rd) – but O was in 3rd in AROSE and got ""-"", so 3rd is invalid.

Next try ""SLOTH"":
- S (1st), L (new), O (3rd) – again O in 3rd is invalid.

Next try ""SOUND"":
- S (1st), O (2nd), U (new), N (new), D (new)
- Contains S and O, avoids A, R, E.
- O is in 2nd, which is allowed (was in 3rd before).
- S is in 1st, which is allowed (was in 4th before).

This seems good.

Another option is ""SULKY"":
- S (1st), U (new), L (new), K (new), Y (new)
- But misses O, which we know is in the word.

So ""SOUND"" is better as it keeps S and O in new positions and adds new letters.

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: A, R, E
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: O, S

2. SOUND → S(-) O(✓) U(-) N(-) D(x)
   - Letters not in the word: D
   - O is now confirmed in position 2 (✓).
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - U is in the word but not in position 3.
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.

Summary so far:
- Letters known to be in the word: O (position 2), S, U, N
- Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, E, D
- S cannot be in position 1 or 4 (from AROSE and SOUND feedback)
- U cannot be in position 3
- N cannot be in position 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Contains S, U, N in some positions (but respecting the above restrictions).
- Does not contain A, R, E, D.

Possible positions:
- O is fixed at position 2: _ O _ _ _
- S can be in positions 2,3,5 (but 2 is O), so 3 or 5.
- U can be in positions 1,2,4,5 (but 2 is O), so 1,4,5.
- N can be in positions 1,2,3,5 (but 2 is O), so 1,3,5.

Let's try to place S, U, N while avoiding the forbidden positions.

Option: S in 3, U in 1, N in 5 → _ O S O N → but O is already in 2, so this would be _ O S _ N, but then U must be placed. Wait, we need to include U somewhere.

Let me think systematically:

Word structure: _ O _ _ _
We need to place S, U, N in positions 1,3,4,5 with constraints:
- S not in 1 or 4 → can be 3 or 5
- U not in 3 → can be 1,4,5
- N not in 4 → can be 1,3,5

Possible combinations:
- S in 3, U in 1, N in 5 → _ O S _ N → but then position 4 is empty; we have U in 1, so word would be U O S _ N → but we need a 5-letter word with these letters. Let's see: U O S _ N → but we have to include all letters O, S, U, N, and one more letter (since it's 5 letters). Wait, the word must contain O, S, U, N plus one more letter (since 4 letters are already accounted for).

Actually, the word must contain O, S, U, N plus one additional letter (since it's 5 letters). But we know from feedback that these four letters are all present. So the word must be a permutation of O, S, U, N plus one more letter, but we have no information about the fifth letter yet.

Wait, let me re-examine: the feedback tells us which letters are in the word, but not necessarily all letters. From SOUND we know O is in position 2, and that S, U, N are in the word but not in their guessed positions. So the word must contain O (fixed at 2), S, U, N, and one more letter (which we haven't tested yet).

So the word is O _ _ _ _ with O in position 2, and must include S, U, N plus one more letter (not A, R, E, D).

Possible fifth letters: common consonants not yet tested: T, L, C, M, etc.

Let's try to construct:

We have positions 1,3,4,5 to fill with S, U, N and one new letter, respecting constraints:
- S not in 1 or 4 → can be 3 or 5
- U not in 3 → can be 1,4,5
- N not in 4 → can be 1,3,5

Let's try S in 3, U in 1, N in 5 → _ O S _ N → but then position 4 is empty; we have U in 1, so word is U O S _ N. We need one more letter for position 4. Possible letters: T, L, C, M, etc.

Let's try U O S T N → but is this a valid word? ""UOSTN"" is not valid.

Next, try S in 5, U in 1, N in 3 → _ O N _ S → U O N _ S → ""UON_S"" - need a letter for position 4. ""UON TS"" is invalid.

Next, try S in 5, U in 4, N in 3 → _ O N U S → possible word: ""CONUS"" - but C is new, and ""CONUS"" is a valid word.

From the feedback:
- O is fixed in position 2.
- S, U, N must appear somewhere, with S not in 1 or 4, U not in 3, N not in 4.
- Letters A, R, E, D are excluded.

A valid word that satisfies these constraints is:

<guess>TONUS</guess>",TONUS,"From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: A, R, E
   - Letters in the word but in wrong positions: O, S

2. SOUND → S(-) O(✓) U(-) N(-) D(x)
   - Letters not in the word: D
   - O is now confirmed in position 2 (✓).
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - U is in the word but not in position 3.
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.

Summary so far:
- Letters known to be in the word: O (position 2), S, U, N
- Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, E, D
- S cannot be in position 1 or 4 (from AROSE and SOUND feedback)
- U cannot be in position 3
- N cannot be in position 4

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Contains S, U, N in some positions (but respecting the above restrictions).
- Does not contain A, R, E, D.

Possible positions:
- O is fixed at position 2: _ O _ _ _
- S can be in positions 2,3,5 (but 2 is O), so 3 or 5.
- U can be in positions 1,2,4,5 (but 2 is O), so 1,4,5.
- N can be in positions 1,2,3,5 (but 2 is O), so 1,3,5.

Let's try to place S, U, N while avoiding the forbidden positions.

Option: S in 3, U in 1, N in 5 → _ O S O N → but O is already in 2, so this would be _ O S _ N, but then U must be placed. Wait, we need to include U somewhere.

Let me think systematically:

Word structure: _ O _ _ _
We need to place S, U, N in positions 1,3,4,5 with constraints:
- S not in 1 or 4 → can be 3 or 5
- U not in 3 → can be 1,4,5
- N not in 4 → can be 1,3,5

Possible combinations:
- S in 3, U in 1, N in 5 → _ O S _ N → but then position 4 is empty; we have U in 1, so word would be U O S _ N → but we need a 5-letter word with these letters. Let's see: U O S _ N → but we have to include all letters O, S, U, N, and one more letter (since it's 5 letters). Wait, the word must contain O, S, U, N plus one more letter (since 4 letters are already accounted for).

Actually, the word must contain O, S, U, N plus one additional letter (since it's 5 letters). But we know from feedback that these four letters are all present. So the word must be a permutation of O, S, U, N plus one more letter, but we have no information about the fifth letter yet.

Wait, let me re-examine: the feedback tells us which letters are in the word, but not necessarily all letters. From SOUND we know O is in position 2, and that S, U, N are in the word but not in their guessed positions. So the word must contain O (fixed at 2), S, U, N, and one more letter (which we haven't tested yet).

So the word is O _ _ _ _ with O in position 2, and must include S, U, N plus one more letter (not A, R, E, D).

Possible fifth letters: common consonants not yet tested: T, L, C, M, etc.

Let's try to construct:

We have positions 1,3,4,5 to fill with S, U, N and one new letter, respecting constraints:
- S not in 1 or 4 → can be 3 or 5
- U not in 3 → can be 1,4,5
- N not in 4 → can be 1,3,5

Let's try S in 3, U in 1, N in 5 → _ O S _ N → but then position 4 is empty; we have U in 1, so word is U O S _ N. We need one more letter for position 4. Possible letters: T, L, C, M, etc.

Let's try U O S T N → but is this a valid word? ""UOSTN"" is not valid.

Next, try S in 5, U in 1, N in 3 → _ O N _ S → U O N _ S → ""UON_S"" - need a letter for position 4. ""UON TS"" is invalid.

Next, try S in 5, U in 4, N in 3 → _ O N U S → possible word: ""CONUS"" - but C is new, and ""CONUS"" is a valid word.

Check constraints:
- O is in position 2 (✓)
- S is in position 5 (allowed, since S cannot be in 1 or 4)
- U is in position 4 (allowed, since U cannot be in 3)
- N is in position 3 (allowed, since N cannot be in 4)
- Contains letters C (new), O, S, U, N - none of A, R, E, D.

""CONUS"" seems valid.

Another option: ""SONUS"" - but S is in position 1, which is forbidden.

""NOUS_"" - but we need a 5-letter word.

""TONUS"" - T is new, O is in 2, N in 3, U in 4, S in 5:
- O in 2 (✓)

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and which aren't. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N). 

Some popular starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ADIEU"", or ""AROSE"". Among these, ""AROSE"" is particularly good because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This should give me good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess since it's a strong opening word that uses common letters in strategic positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 3rd).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong position (currently 4th).
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: A, R, E
- Letters that ARE in the word: O, S (but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively)

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains O and S.
2. Does NOT contain A, R, or E.
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3.
4. Places S somewhere other than position 4.

Good consonants to try next: T, N, L, C, D, M, P, etc.
Good vowels left: I, U (since A and E are out, and O is already confirmed).

Let’s try to place O and S in new positions while adding new common letters.

Possible positions:
- O could be 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th.
- S could be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th.

Let’s try ""POINT"":
- P (new), O (in 2nd, not 3rd), I (new), N (new), T (new)
- Contains O and S? No S, so this is invalid.

Next try ""SOILS"":
- S (1st, not 4th), O (2nd, not 3rd), I (new), L (new), S (5th)
- Contains S and O, and avoids A, R, E.
- But has two S’s – not ideal.

Next try ""SPOIL"":
- S (1st), P (new), O (3rd) – but O was in 3rd in AROSE and got ""-"", so 3rd is invalid.

Next try ""SLOTH"":
- S (1st), L (new), O (3rd) – again O in 3rd is invalid.

Next try ""SOUND"":
- S (1st), O (2nd), U (new), N (new), D (new)
- Contains S and O, avoids A, R, E.
- O is in 2nd, which is allowed (was in 3rd before).
- S is in 1st, which is allowed (was in 4th before).

This seems good.

Another option is ""SULKY"":
- S (1st), U (new), L (new), K (new), Y (new)
- But misses O, which we know is in the word.

So ""SOUND"" is better as it keeps S and O in new positions and adds new letters.

Let’s go with ""SOUND"".

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: A, R, E

   - S is in the word but not in position 1.
   - U is in the word but not in position 3.
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.

Summary so far:

- Letters known NOT in the word: A, R, E, D
- S cannot be in position 1 or 4 (from AROSE and SOUND feedback)
- U cannot be in position 3

Wait, let me re-examine: the feedback tells us which letters are in the word, but not necessarily all letters.

Next, try S in 5, U in 1, N in 3 → _ O N _ S → U O N _ S → ""UON_S"" - need a letter for position 4. ""UON TS"" is invalid.

Next, try S in 5, U in 4, N in 3 → _ O N U S → possible word: ""CONUS"" - but C is new, and ""CONUS"" is a valid word.
