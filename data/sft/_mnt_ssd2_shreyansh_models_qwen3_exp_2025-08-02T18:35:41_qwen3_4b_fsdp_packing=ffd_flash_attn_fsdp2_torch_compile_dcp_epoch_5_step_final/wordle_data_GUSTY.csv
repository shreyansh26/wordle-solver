### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll pick a word that combines several of these to help narrow down possibilities quickly. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives us good coverage for vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, but not in the 4th position (since S was in position 4 and marked wrong).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

Good letters to try next: common consonants and vowels we haven’t ruled out. Available vowels: I, U, Y (since A, E, O are out). Consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc.

A word that fits: “spilt”
- S is in position 1 (new position).
- P, I, L, T are all new letters we haven’t tested yet.
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, E).

This should give us more information about P, I, L, T and confirm where S belongs.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. I'll pick a word that combines several of these to help narrow down possibilities quickly. ""AROSE"" is a good choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and gives us good coverage for vowels and consonants.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A, R, O, E are NOT in the word (x).
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So we need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains S, but not in the 4th position (since S was in position 4 and marked wrong).
2. Does NOT contain A, R, O, E.

Good letters to try next: common consonants and vowels we haven’t ruled out. Available vowels: I, U, Y (since A, E, O are out). Consonants: T, N, L, C, D, P, M, etc.

A word that fits: “spilt”
- S is in position 1 (new position).
- P, I, L, T are all new letters we haven’t tested yet.
- No forbidden letters (A, R, O, E).

This should give us more information about P, I, L, T and confirm where S belongs.

From the two guesses so far:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)

2. spilt → S(-) P(x) I(x) L(x) T(-)  
   – S is in the word but NOT in position 1.  
   – T is in the word but NOT in position 5.

Forbidden letters so far: A, R, O, E, P, I, L.

Allowed letters (common ones left): S, T, plus U, Y, N, C, D, M, G, B, F, H, K, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- contains both S and T,  
- places S not in position 1 or 4,  
- places T not in position 5,  
- uses only allowed letters.

Candidate positions:
S can be in 2, 3, or 5.  
T can be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.

A simple word that satisfies these constraints: “stuns”
- S in position 2 (allowed).  
- T in position 1 (allowed).  
- Uses only allowed letters (S, T, U, N).  
- No repeats of forbidden letters.

From the feedback on busty:
- B(x) – B is not in the word.
- U, S, T, Y are already confirmed in their correct positions.

So the word structure is: _ U S T Y.

Letters already ruled out include A, R, O, E, P, I, L, N, M, B.  
Remaining possible first letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, etc.

The only common English 5-letter word ending in “USTY” with a first letter not yet ruled out is “dusty”.  
Let’s confirm:
- D has not been tested yet.
- “Dusty” fits the pattern _ U S T Y.

Therefore, the next and final guess is “dusty”.
