### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters in different positions.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers different positions. This will help me quickly identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R (but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively).
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A and R.
2. Does not include O, S, or E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places R somewhere other than position 2.

Good candidate letters (excluding O, S, E): A, R, plus the remaining common letters like T, N, L, I, C, U, D, etc.

A word that satisfies these constraints and uses other common letters is ""TRAIN"":
- T, R, A, I, N.
- R is not in position 2 (it's in position 2 here, so this is invalid because R was marked wrong in position 2).

Next candidate: ""TRAIL"":
- T, R, A, I, L.
- R is in position 2 (invalid, same reason).

Next: ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A, N, E → E is excluded (invalid).

Next: ""GRAIN"":
- G, R, A, I, N → R is in position 2 (invalid).

Next: ""RADIO"":
- R, A, D, I, O → O is excluded (invalid).

Next: ""RAIND"":
- R, A, I, N, D → R is in position 1 (invalid, A was wrong in position 1 but R is in position 1 here, and R was wrong in position 2, but this is allowed because the feedback only says R is wrong in position 2, not necessarily position 1).

But ""RAIND"" is not a valid English word.

Next: ""RAINY"":
- R, A, I, N, Y → R is in position 1 (allowed), A is in position 2 (allowed), and no excluded letters. This seems valid.

However, ""RAINY"" has R in position 1 and A in position 2. The feedback only said A is wrong in position 1, so position 2 is fine. R was wrong in position 2, so position 1 is fine.

""RAINY"" seems valid.

Another candidate: ""RATIO"":
- R, A, T, I, O → O is excluded (invalid).

""RAVINE"" is 6 letters.

""RANCH"":
- R, A, N, C, H → R in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), no excluded letters. This is valid.

Between ""RAINY"" and ""RANCH"", ""RANCH"" is more common.

Let me check ""RANCH"":
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since the only info about R is it was wrong in position 2).
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since the only info about A is it was wrong in position 1).
- No O, S, E.

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
- A is in the word but not in position 1.  
- R is in the word but not in position 2.  
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

Round 2: ranch → R(-) A(-) N(x) C(x) H(x)  
- R is in the word but not in position 1.  
- A is in the word but not in position 2.  
- N, C, H are not in the word at all.

Summary so far:
- Letters that must appear: A, R  
- Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S, E, N, C, H  
- Positions ruled out:  
  – A cannot be in position 1 or 2.  
  – R cannot be in position 1 or 2.  

So A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (and not in position 1 or 2).

Remaining common letters (excluding the banned ones) include: D, G, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and R.  
2. Places A in position 3, 4, or 5.  
3. Places R in position 3, 4, or 5 (but not in the same position as A).  
4. Uses only the allowed letters.

Candidate words that satisfy these constraints:
- TRIAD: T, R, I, A, D → A in 4, R in 2 (invalid, R can’t be in 2).  
- TRIAR: invalid (not a word).  
- TRAIL: T, R, A, I, L → A in 3, R in 2 (invalid).  
- RATIO: O excluded.  
- GRAIN: N, C excluded.  
- RAVEN: N, C, H excluded.  
- RAPID: T, I, D allowed → A in 2 (invalid).  
- RAVIN: N excluded.  
- TRAMP: T, M, P allowed → A in 2 (invalid).  
- RAVEL: N, C, H excluded.  
- RAVEN: N excluded.  
- RAVIN: N excluded.  
- RAVEN: N excluded.  
- RAVEN: N excluded.  

Looking at position constraints:
A must be in 3, 4, or 5.  
R must be in 3, 4, or 5 and not in the same spot as A.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ A R _  
- _ _ R A _  
- _ A _ R _  
- _ R _ A _  
- A _ _ R _  
- R _ _ A _  

But A cannot be in 1 or 2, R cannot be in 1 or 2.

Let’s try _ A _ R _ pattern with allowed letters:
- B A D R _ → BADRY (invalid).  
- G A D R _ → GADR_ (invalid).  
- L A D R _ → LADR_ (invalid).  
- T A D R _ → TADR_ (invalid).  
- V A D R _ → VADR_ (invalid).  

Try _ R _ A _ pattern:
- T R I A _ → TRIAD (A in 4, R in 2 → R invalid position).  
- P R I A _ → PRIAD (invalid).  
- D R I A _ → DRIAD → D, R, I, A, D → valid word, A in 4, R in 2 (invalid).  

Try _ _ A R _ pattern:
- T R A _ _ → TRA_ _ (A in 3, R in 2 → R invalid).  
- G R A _ _ → GRA_ _ (A in 3, R in 2 → R invalid).  
- B R A _ _ → BRA_ _ (A in 3, R in 2 → R invalid).  
- P R A _ _ → PRA_ _ (A in 3, R in 2 → R invalid).  

Try _ _ R A _ pattern:
- T R _ A _ → TR _ A _ (R in 2 → invalid).  
- G R _ A _ → GR _ A _ (R in 2 → invalid).  
- B R _ A _ → BR _ A _ (R in 2 → invalid).  

Try A _ _ R _ pattern:
- A T _ R _ → AT _ R _ (A in 1 → invalid).  
- A T I R _ → ATIR_ (invalid).  

Try R _ _ A _ pattern:
- R _ _ A _ (R in 1 → invalid).  

We need to place A and R in positions 3-5 with no overlap.

Possible valid patterns:
- _ _ A R _ → A in 3, R in 4.  
- _ _ R A _ → R in 3, A in 4.  
- _ A _ R _ → A in 2 (invalid).  
- _ R _ A _ → R in 2 (invalid).  
- A _ _ R _ → A in 1 (invalid).  
- R _ _ A _ → R in 1 (invalid).  

So only valid patterns are _ _ A R _ and _ _ R A _.

Let’s look for words in these patterns:
- _ _ A R _:  
  - T R A _ _ → TRA_ _ (A in 3, R in 4).  TRAIL (L allowed) → A in 3, R in 4.  TRAIL is valid.  
  - G R A _ _ → GRA_ _ → GRAID (invalid).  
  - B R A _ _ → BRA_ _ → BRAID (D allowed) → A in 3, R in 4.  BRAID is valid.  

- _ _ R A _:  
  - T R _ A _ → TR _ A _ → TRAIL (A in 4) → A in 4, R in 2 (invalid).  
  - G R _ A _ → GR _ A _ → GRAMP (invalid).  
  - B R _ A _ → BR _ A _ → BRAGA (invalid).  

Between TRAIL and BRAID:
- TRAIL: T, R, A, I, L → A in 3, R in 4.  All letters allowed.  
- BRAID: B, R, A, I, D → A in 3, R in 4.  All letters allowed.  

TRAIL uses more common letters (I, L) and is more likely.

So the next guess is TRAIL.

<guess>trail</guess>",trail,"From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
- A is in the word but not in position 1.  
- R is in the word but not in position 2.  
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

Round 2: ranch → R(-) A(-) N(x) C(x) H(x)  
- R is in the word but not in position 1.  
- A is in the word but not in position 2.  
- N, C, H are not in the word at all.

Summary so far:
- Letters that must appear: A, R  
- Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S, E, N, C, H  
- Positions ruled out:  
  – A cannot be in position 1 or 2.  
  – R cannot be in position 1 or 2.  

So A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (and not in position 1 or 2).

Remaining common letters (excluding the banned ones) include: D, G, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and R.  
2. Places A in position 3, 4, or 5.  
3. Places R in position 3, 4, or 5 (but not in the same position as A).  
4. Uses only the allowed letters.

Candidate words that satisfy these constraints:
- TRIAD: T, R, I, A, D → A in 4, R in 2 (invalid, R can’t be in 2).  
- TRIAR: invalid (not a word).  
- TRAIL: T, R, A, I, L → A in 3, R in 2 (invalid).  
- RATIO: O excluded.  
- GRAIN: N, C excluded.  
- RAVEN: N, C, H excluded.

- RAVEL: N, C, H excluded.  
- RAVEN: N excluded.  
- RAVIN: N excluded.  
- RAVEN: N excluded.  
- RAVEN: N excluded.  

Looking at position constraints:
A must be in 3, 4, or 5.  
R must be in 3, 4, or 5 and not in the same spot as A.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ A R _  
- _ _ R A _  
- _ A _ R _  
- _ R _ A _  
- A _ _ R _  
- R _ _ A _  

But A cannot be in 1 or 2, R cannot be in 1 or 2.

Let’s try _ A _ R _ pattern with allowed letters:
- B A D R _ → BADRY (invalid).  
- G A D R _ → GADR_ (invalid).  
- L A D R _ → LADR_ (invalid).  
- T A D R _ → TADR_ (invalid).  
- V A D R _ → VADR_ (invalid).  

Try _ R _ A _ pattern:
- T R I A _ → TRIAD (A in 4, R in 2 → R invalid position).  
- P R I A _ → PRIAD (invalid).  
- D R I A _ → DRIAD → D, R, I, A, D → valid word, A in 4, R in 2 (invalid).  

Try _ _ A R _ pattern:
- T R A _ _ → TRA_ _ (A in 3, R in 2 → R invalid).  
- G R A _ _ → GRA_ _ (A in 3, R in 2 → R invalid).  
- B R A _ _ → BRA_ _ (A in 3, R in 2 → R invalid).  
- P R A _ _ → PRA_ _ (A in 3, R in 2 → R invalid).  

Try _ _ R A _ pattern:

- G R _ A _ → GR _ A _ (R in 2 → invalid).  
- B R _ A _ → BR _ A _ (R in 2 → invalid).  

Try A _ _ R _ pattern:
- A T _ R _ → AT _ R _ (A in 1 → invalid).  
- A T I R _ → ATIR_ (invalid).  

Try R _ _ A _ pattern:
- R _ _ A _ (R in 1 → invalid).  

We need to place A and R in positions 3-5 with no overlap.

Possible valid patterns:
- _ _ A R _ → A in 3, R in 4.  
- _ _ R A _ → R in 3, A in 4.  
- _ A _ R _ → A in 2 (invalid).  
- _ R _ A _ → R in 2 (invalid).  
- A _ _ R _ → A in 1 (invalid).  
- R _ _ A _ → R in 1 (invalid).  

So only valid patterns are _ _ A R _ and _ _ R A _.

Let’s look for words in these patterns:
- _ _ A R _:  
  - T R A _ _ → TRA_ _ (A in 3, R in 4).  TRAIL (L allowed) → A in 3, R in 4.  TRAIL is valid.  
  - G R A _ _ → GRA_ _ → GRAID (invalid).

  - G R _ A _ → GR _ A _ → GRAMP (invalid).  
  - B R _ A _ → BR _ A _ → BRAGA (invalid).  

Between TRAIL and BRAID:
- TRAIL: T, R, A, I, L → A in 3, R in 4.  All letters allowed.  
- BRAID: B, R, A, I, D → A in 3, R in 4.  All letters allowed.  

TRAIL uses more common letters (I, L) and is more likely.

So the next guess is TRAIL.",Guess 3: trail -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(-) A(✓) I(-) L(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters in different positions.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers different positions. This will help me quickly identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R (but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively).
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A and R.
2. Does not include O, S, or E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places R somewhere other than position 2.

Good candidate letters (excluding O, S, E): A, R, plus the remaining common letters like T, N, L, I, C, U, D, etc.

A word that satisfies these constraints and uses other common letters is ""TRAIN"":
- T, R, A, I, N.
- R is not in position 2 (it's in position 2 here, so this is invalid because R was marked wrong in position 2).

Next candidate: ""TRAIL"":
- T, R, A, I, L.
- R is in position 2 (invalid, same reason).

Next: ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A, N, E → E is excluded (invalid).

Next: ""GRAIN"":
- G, R, A, I, N → R is in position 2 (invalid).

Next: ""RADIO"":
- R, A, D, I, O → O is excluded (invalid).

Next: ""RAIND"":
- R, A, I, N, D → R is in position 1 (invalid, A was wrong in position 1 but R is in position 1 here, and R was wrong in position 2, but this is allowed because the feedback only says R is wrong in position 2, not necessarily position 1).

But ""RAIND"" is not a valid English word.

Next: ""RAINY"":
- R, A, I, N, Y → R is in position 1 (allowed), A is in position 2 (allowed), and no excluded letters. This seems valid.

However, ""RAINY"" has R in position 1 and A in position 2. The feedback only said A is wrong in position 1, so position 2 is fine. R was wrong in position 2, so position 1 is fine.

""RAINY"" seems valid.

Another candidate: ""RATIO"":
- R, A, T, I, O → O is excluded (invalid).

""RAVINE"" is 6 letters.

""RANCH"":
- R, A, N, C, H → R in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), no excluded letters. This is valid.

Between ""RAINY"" and ""RANCH"", ""RANCH"" is more common.

Let me check ""RANCH"":
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since the only info about R is it was wrong in position 2).
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since the only info about A is it was wrong in position 1).
- No O, S, E.

This seems like a good next guess.

Guess 2: ranch -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) N(x) C(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>

From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
- A is in the word but not in position 1.  
- R is in the word but not in position 2.  
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

- R is in the word but not in position 1.  
- A is in the word but not in position 2.  
- N, C, H are not in the word at all.

- Letters that must appear: A, R

- Positions ruled out:  
  – A cannot be in position 1 or 2.  
  – R cannot be in position 1 or 2.  

So A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (and not in position 1 or 2).

Remaining common letters (excluding the banned ones) include: D, G, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and R.  
2. Places A in position 3, 4, or 5.  
3. Places R in position 3, 4, or 5 (but not in the same position as A).  
4. Uses only the allowed letters.

Candidate words that satisfy these constraints:
- TRIAD: T, R, I, A, D → A in 4, R in 2 (invalid, R can’t be in 2).  
- TRIAR: invalid (not a word).  
- TRAIL: T, R, A, I, L → A in 3, R in 2 (invalid).  
- RATIO: O excluded.

- RAVEL: N, C, H excluded.  
- RAVEN: N excluded.

- RAVEN: N excluded.  
- RAVEN: N excluded.  

Looking at position constraints:
A must be in 3, 4, or 5.  
R must be in 3, 4, or 5 and not in the same spot as A.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ A R _  
- _ _ R A _  
- _ A _ R _  
- _ R _ A _  
- A _ _ R _  
- R _ _ A _  

But A cannot be in 1 or 2, R cannot be in 1 or 2.

Let’s try _ A _ R _ pattern with allowed letters:
- B A D R _ → BADRY (invalid).  
- G A D R _ → GADR_ (invalid).  
- L A D R _ → LADR_ (invalid).  
- T A D R _ → TADR_ (invalid).  
- V A D R _ → VADR_ (invalid).  

Try _ R _ A _ pattern:
- T R I A _ → TRIAD (A in 4, R in 2 → R invalid position).  
- P R I A _ → PRIAD (invalid).  
- D R I A _ → DRIAD → D, R, I, A, D → valid word, A in 4, R in 2 (invalid).  

Try _ _ A R _ pattern:
- T R A _ _ → TRA_ _ (A in 3, R in 2 → R invalid).  
- G R A _ _ → GRA_ _ (A in 3, R in 2 → R invalid).  
- B R A _ _ → BRA_ _ (A in 3, R in 2 → R invalid).  
- P R A _ _ → PRA_ _ (A in 3, R in 2 → R invalid).  

Try _ _ R A _ pattern:
- T R _ A _ → TR _ A _ (R in 2 → invalid).  
- G R _ A _ → GR _ A _ (R in 2 → invalid).  
- B R _ A _ → BR _ A _ (R in 2 → invalid).  

Try A _ _ R _ pattern:
- A T _ R _ → AT _ R _ (A in 1 → invalid).  
- A T I R _ → ATIR_ (invalid).  

Try R _ _ A _ pattern:
- R _ _ A _ (R in 1 → invalid).  

We need to place A and R in positions 3-5 with no overlap.

Possible valid patterns:
- _ _ A R _ → A in 3, R in 4.  
- _ _ R A _ → R in 3, A in 4.  
- _ A _ R _ → A in 2 (invalid).  
- _ R _ A _ → R in 2 (invalid).  
- A _ _ R _ → A in 1 (invalid).  
- R _ _ A _ → R in 1 (invalid).  

So only valid patterns are _ _ A R _ and _ _ R A _.

Let’s look for words in these patterns:
- _ _ A R _:  
  - T R A _ _ → TRA_ _ (A in 3, R in 4).  TRAIL (L allowed) → A in 3, R in 4.  TRAIL is valid.  
  - G R A _ _ → GRA_ _ → GRAID (invalid).  
  - B R A _ _ → BRA_ _ → BRAID (D allowed) → A in 3, R in 4.  BRAID is valid.  

- _ _ R A _:  
  - T R _ A _ → TR _ A _ → TRAIL (A in 4) → A in 4, R in 2 (invalid).  
  - G R _ A _ → GR _ A _ → GRAMP (invalid).  
  - B R _ A _ → BR _ A _ → BRAGA (invalid).  

Between TRAIL and BRAID:
- TRAIL: T, R, A, I, L → A in 3, R in 4.  All letters allowed.  
- BRAID: B, R, A, I, D → A in 3, R in 4.  All letters allowed.  

TRAIL uses more common letters (I, L) and is more likely.

So the next guess is TRAIL.

From the new feedback on TRAIL:

- T(✓) → T is in position 1 and correct.

- A(✓) → A is in position 3 and correct.
- I(-) → I is in the word but not in position 4.
- L(x) → L is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: T _ A _ _
- Must contain: R, I
- Must not contain: O, S, E, N, C, H, L
- R cannot be in position 2 (from arose) or position 2 (from trail) → R can only be in positions 3, 4, or 5.  But position 3 is A, so R must be in 4 or 5.
- I cannot be in position 4 (from trail) → I must be in position 2 or 5.

Possible positions:
- Position 1: T (fixed)
- Position 2: I or other allowed letters
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: R or other allowed letters
- Position 5: remaining letters

Let's list possible placements:
1. R in 4, I in 2 → T I A R _
2. R in 5, I in 2 → T I A _ R
3. R in 5, I in 5 → impossible (overlap)
4. I in 5, R in 4 → T _ A R I

So two viable patterns:
- T I A R _
- T I A _ R
- T _ A R I

We need a 5-letter word that fits one of these patterns using only allowed letters (not O,S,E,N,C,H,L).

Let's check each pattern:

1. T I A R _  
   Possible letters left (excluding banned and used): B, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y  
   Need a letter for position 5.  Possible words:

   - TIARY (valid word meaning ""the state of being in a state of being a woman"")

2. T I A _ R  
   Possible letters for position 4: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y

   It seems no valid word fits T I A _ R with remaining letters.

3. T _ A R I  
   Position 2 can be any allowed letter except R, I, A, T (already used).  
   Allowed letters for position 2: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y

Possible positions:

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to use a word that contains several of these common letters in different positions.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains five of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and covers different positions. This will help me quickly identify which of these common letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

<guess>arose</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word at all.
- S(x) → S is not in the word at all.
- E(x) → E is not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and R (but not in positions 1 and 2 respectively).
- Does NOT contain O, S, or E.

I need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Includes A and R.
2. Does not include O, S, or E.
3. Places A somewhere other than position 1.
4. Places R somewhere other than position 2.

Good candidate letters (excluding O, S, E): A, R, plus the remaining common letters like T, N, L, I, C, U, D, etc.

A word that satisfies these constraints and uses other common letters is ""TRAIN"":
- T, R, A, I, N.
- R is not in position 2 (it's in position 2 here, so this is invalid because R was marked wrong in position 2).

Next candidate: ""TRAIL"":
- T, R, A, I, L.
- R is in position 2 (invalid, same reason).

Next: ""CRANE"":
- C, R, A, N, E → E is excluded (invalid).

Next: ""GRAIN"":
- G, R, A, I, N → R is in position 2 (invalid).

Next: ""RADIO"":
- R, A, D, I, O → O is excluded (invalid).

Next: ""RAIND"":
- R, A, I, N, D → R is in position 1 (invalid, A was wrong in position 1 but R is in position 1 here, and R was wrong in position 2, but this is allowed because the feedback only says R is wrong in position 2, not necessarily position 1).

But ""RAIND"" is not a valid English word.

Next: ""RAINY"":
- R, A, I, N, Y → R is in position 1 (allowed), A is in position 2 (allowed), and no excluded letters. This seems valid.

However, ""RAINY"" has R in position 1 and A in position 2. The feedback only said A is wrong in position 1, so position 2 is fine. R was wrong in position 2, so position 1 is fine.

""RAINY"" seems valid.

Another candidate: ""RATIO"":
- R, A, T, I, O → O is excluded (invalid).

""RAVINE"" is 6 letters.

""RANCH"":
- R, A, N, C, H → R in position 1 (allowed), A in position 2 (allowed), no excluded letters. This is valid.

Between ""RAINY"" and ""RANCH"", ""RANCH"" is more common.

Let me check ""RANCH"":
- R is in position 1 (allowed, since the only info about R is it was wrong in position 2).
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since the only info about A is it was wrong in position 1).
- No O, S, E.

This seems like a good next guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: ranch -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) N(x) C(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback:

Round 1: arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)  
- A is in the word but not in position 1.  
- R is in the word but not in position 2.  
- O, S, E are not in the word at all.

Round 2: ranch → R(-) A(-) N(x) C(x) H(x)  
- R is in the word but not in position 1.  
- A is in the word but not in position 2.  
- N, C, H are not in the word at all.

Summary so far:
- Letters that must appear: A, R  
- Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S, E, N, C, H  
- Positions ruled out:  
  – A cannot be in position 1 or 2.  
  – R cannot be in position 1 or 2.  

So A must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5 (and not in position 1 or 2).

Remaining common letters (excluding the banned ones) include: D, G, I, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and R.  
2. Places A in position 3, 4, or 5.  
3. Places R in position 3, 4, or 5 (but not in the same position as A).  
4. Uses only the allowed letters.

Candidate words that satisfy these constraints:
- TRIAD: T, R, I, A, D → A in 4, R in 2 (invalid, R can’t be in 2).  
- TRIAR: invalid (not a word).  
- TRAIL: T, R, A, I, L → A in 3, R in 2 (invalid).  
- RATIO: O excluded.  
- GRAIN: N, C excluded.  
- RAVEN: N, C, H excluded.  
- RAPID: T, I, D allowed → A in 2 (invalid).  
- RAVIN: N excluded.  
- TRAMP: T, M, P allowed → A in 2 (invalid).  
- RAVEL: N, C, H excluded.  
- RAVEN: N excluded.  
- RAVIN: N excluded.  
- RAVEN: N excluded.  
- RAVEN: N excluded.  

Looking at position constraints:
A must be in 3, 4, or 5.  
R must be in 3, 4, or 5 and not in the same spot as A.

Possible patterns:
- _ _ A R _  
- _ _ R A _

We need to place A and R in positions 3-5 with no overlap.

Possible valid patterns:
- _ _ A R _ → A in 3, R in 4.  
- _ _ R A _ → R in 3, A in 4.  
- _ A _ R _ → A in 2 (invalid).  
- _ R _ A _ → R in 2 (invalid).  
- A _ _ R _ → A in 1 (invalid).  
- R _ _ A _ → R in 1 (invalid).  

So only valid patterns are _ _ A R _ and _ _ R A _.

Let’s look for words in these patterns:
- _ _ A R _:  
  - T R A _ _ → TRA_ _ (A in 3, R in 4).  TRAIL (L allowed) → A in 3, R in 4.  TRAIL is valid.  
  - G R A _ _ → GRA_ _ → GRAID (invalid).  
  - B R A _ _ → BRA_ _ → BRAID (D allowed) → A in 3, R in 4.  BRAID is valid.  

- _ _ R A _:  
  - T R _ A _ → TR _ A _ → TRAIL (A in 4) → A in 4, R in 2 (invalid).  
  - G R _ A _ → GR _ A _ → GRAMP (invalid).  
  - B R _ A _ → BR _ A _ → BRAGA (invalid).  

Between TRAIL and BRAID:
- TRAIL: T, R, A, I, L → A in 3, R in 4.  All letters allowed.  
- BRAID: B, R, A, I, D → A in 3, R in 4.  All letters allowed.  

TRAIL uses more common letters (I, L) and is more likely.

So the next guess is TRAIL.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ranch -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) N(x) C(x) H(x)
Guess 3: trail -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(-) A(✓) I(-) L(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on TRAIL:

- T(✓) → T is in position 1 and correct.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- A(✓) → A is in position 3 and correct.
- I(-) → I is in the word but not in position 4.
- L(x) → L is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: T _ A _ _
- Must contain: R, I
- Must not contain: O, S, E, N, C, H, L
- R cannot be in position 2 (from arose) or position 2 (from trail) → R can only be in positions 3, 4, or 5.  But position 3 is A, so R must be in 4 or 5.
- I cannot be in position 4 (from trail) → I must be in position 2 or 5.

Possible positions:
- Position 1: T (fixed)
- Position 2: I or other allowed letters
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: R or other allowed letters
- Position 5: remaining letters

Let's list possible placements:
1. R in 4, I in 2 → T I A R _
2. R in 5, I in 2 → T I A _ R
3. R in 5, I in 5 → impossible (overlap)
4. I in 5, R in 4 → T _ A R I

So two viable patterns:
- T I A R _
- T I A _ R
- T _ A R I

We need a 5-letter word that fits one of these patterns using only allowed letters (not O,S,E,N,C,H,L).

Let's check each pattern:

1. T I A R _  
   Possible letters left (excluding banned and used): B, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y  
   Need a letter for position 5.  Possible words:
   - TIARD (invalid)
   - TIARP (invalid)
   - TIARY (valid word meaning ""the state of being in a state of being a woman"")

2. T I A _ R  
   Possible letters for position 4: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y  
   Possible words:
   - TIABR (invalid)
   - TIADR (invalid)
   - TIAGR (invalid)
   - TIARK (invalid)
   - TIAMR (invalid)
   - TIAVR (invalid)
   - TIAPR (invalid)
   - TIATR (invalid)
   - TIABR (invalid)
   - TIARD (invalid)
   - TIAGY (invalid)
   - TIAPY (invalid)
   - TIABM (invalid)
   - TIADG (invalid)
   - TIAGM (invalid)
   - TIABP (invalid)
   - TIADP (invalid)
   - TIAGP (invalid)
   - TIABD (invalid)
   - TIAGD (invalid)
   - TIABF (invalid)
   - TIAGF (invalid)
   - TIABG (invalid)
   - TIAGB (invalid)
   - TIABK (invalid)
   - TIAGK (invalid)
   - TIABM (invalid)
   - TIAGM (invalid)
   - TIABN (invalid) - N is banned
   - TIABP (invalid)
   - TIABQ (invalid)
   - TIABR (invalid)
   - TIABS (invalid) - S is banned
   - TIABT (invalid)
   - TIABU (invalid)
   - TIABV (invalid)
   - TIABW (invalid)
   - TIABX (invalid)
   - TIABY (invalid)
   - TIABZ (invalid)
   - TIAC_ (invalid) - C is banned
   - TIAD_ (already checked)
   - TIAE_ (invalid) - E is banned
   - TIAF_ (invalid)
   - TIA G _ (invalid)
   - TIAH_ (invalid) - H is banned
   - TIAI_ (invalid)
   - TIAJ_ (invalid)
   - TIAK_ (invalid)
   - TIAL_ (invalid) - L is banned
   - TIAM_ (invalid)
   - TIAN_ (invalid) - N is banned
   - TIAO_ (invalid) - O is banned
   - TIAQ_ (invalid)
   - TIAR_ (invalid)
   - TIAS_ (invalid) - S is banned
   - TIA T_ (invalid)
   - TIAU_ (invalid)
   - TIAV_ (invalid)
   - TIAW_ (invalid)
   - TIA X_ (invalid)
   - TIA Y_ (invalid)
   - TIA Z_ (invalid)

   It seems no valid word fits T I A _ R with remaining letters.

3. T _ A R I  
   Position 2 can be any allowed letter except R, I, A, T (already used).  
   Allowed letters for position 2: B, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y  
   Possible words:
   - T B A R I (invalid)
   - T D A R I (invalid)
   - T F A R I (invalid)
   - T G A R I (invalid)
   - T K A R I (invalid)
   - T M A R I (invalid)
   - T P A R I (invalid)
   - T U A R I (invalid)
   - T V A R I (invalid)
   - T W A R I (invalid)
   - T Y A R I (invalid)

   None of these are valid English words.

The only valid word found is TIARY (meaning ""the state of being in a state of being a woman"" - a rare but valid word).

Thus, the next guess is TIARY.

From Guess 4 (tiary):

So the revealed pattern is:

T I A R _

Only the last letter is unknown.  
Letters already confirmed NOT in the word: O, S, E, N, C, H, L, Y.  
Remaining possible letters (from the alphabet excluding these and the already used T, I, A, R): B, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter English words that fit T I A R _:

- T I A R B → TIARB (invalid)
- T I A R D → TIARD (invalid)
- T I A R F → TIARF (invalid)
- T I A R G → TIARG (invalid)
- T I A R K → TIARK (invalid)
- T I A R M → TIARM (invalid)
- T I A R P → TIARP (invalid)
- T I A R U → TIARU (invalid)
- T I A R V → TIARV (invalid)
- T I A R W → TIARW (invalid)
- T I A R Z → TIARZ (invalid)

None of these are valid English words.  
However, ""TIAR"" is a common prefix, and the only common word that fits is ""TIARA"", but that would be 5 letters and already has R in position 4.  ""TIARA"" would be T I A R A, but A is already in position 3 and cannot repeat (since feedback for A in position 3 was ✓, meaning it's correct there and not present elsewhere).  Therefore, A cannot appear again.

This suggests we must have missed a valid word.  Rechecking the dictionary, the only valid English word that fits T I A R _ is ""TIARA"", but that would place A in position 5, which is allowed since A is only confirmed in position 3.  However, ""TIARA"" is 5 letters: T I A R A.

But let's verify:
- T I A R A: positions 1-4 match tiary feedback (T I A R), and the last A is allowed since A is only confirmed in position 3 (not necessarily excluded elsewhere).

Therefore, the next logical guess is TIARA.

Letters already confirmed NOT in the word: O, S, E, N, C, H, L, Y.  
Remaining possible letters (from the alphabet excluding these and the already used T, I, A, R): B, D, F, G, K, M, P, U, V, W, Z.

Looking for valid 5-letter English words that fit T I A R _:

- T I A R B → TIARB (invalid)
- T I A R D → TIARD (invalid)
- T I A R F → TIARF (invalid)
- T I A R G → TIARG (invalid)
- T I A R K → TIARK (invalid)
- T I A R M → TIARM (invalid)
- T I A R P → TIARP (invalid)
- T I A R U → TIARU (invalid)
- T I A R V → TIARV (invalid)
- T I A R W → TIARW (invalid)
- T I A R Z → TIARZ (invalid)

None of these are valid English words.  
However, ""TIAR"" is a common prefix, and the only common word that fits is ""TIARA"", but that would be 5 letters and already has R in position 4.  ""TIARA"" would be T I A R A, but A is already in position 3 and cannot repeat (since feedback for A in position 3 was ✓, meaning it's correct there and not present elsewhere).  Therefore, A cannot appear again.

This suggests we must have missed a valid word.  Rechecking the dictionary, the only valid English word that fits T I A R _ is ""TIARA"", but that would place A in position 5, which is allowed since A is only confirmed in position 3.  However, ""TIARA"" is 5 letters: T I A R A.

But let's verify:
- T I A R A: positions 1-4 match tiary feedback (T I A R), and the last A is allowed since A is only confirmed in position 3 (not necessarily excluded elsewhere).

Therefore, the next logical guess is TIARA.",Guess 5: tiara -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) I(✓) A(✓) R(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
