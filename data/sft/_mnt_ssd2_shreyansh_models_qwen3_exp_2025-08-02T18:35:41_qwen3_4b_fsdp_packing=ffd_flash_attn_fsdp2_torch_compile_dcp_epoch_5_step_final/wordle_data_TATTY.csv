For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good starting word often includes common letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word right away.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is somewhere else).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

We now know:
1. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
2. It DOES contain A, but not in the first position.

Since we can't use R, O, S, E, we need a new set of common consonants and vowels. The remaining common vowels are I and U, and common consonants include T, N, L, C, D, etc. 

A good next guess should:
- Include A (but not in position 1).
- Avoid R, O, S, E.
- Use other common letters to maximize information.

""UNTIL"" is a strong candidate:
- It has A (but we don't need it here; let's try another vowel set).
- Let's try ""AUDIO"" - but O is excluded.
- How about ""UNITY"" - but it has U and I, which are good, but no A.
- Let's try ""ALERT"" - but R is excluded.
- ""ADMIT"" - uses A, D, M, I, T. All letters are allowed (R, O, S, E are excluded, but A is allowed). A is in position 1 here, but we know A is not in position 1 from the feedback. So A can't be in position 1, but can be in 2-5. So ""ADMIT"" has A in position 1 - bad choice.
- ""PLANT"" - has A in position 3. This is acceptable since A can be in positions 2-5. It also uses P, L, N, T - all allowed letters.

Another option is ""BLAND"" - B, L, A, N, D. A is in position 3 - acceptable. Uses common letters.

Between ""PLANT"" and ""BLAND"", both are good. ""PLANT"" uses P, L, A, N, T - all allowed. ""BLAND"" uses B, L, A, N, D - also good.

I'll go with ""PLANT"" as it uses P, L, A, N, T - giving us coverage of several consonants and the known A.

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)

   - A is still in the word but not in position 3 (because in plant it was in position 3 and got “-”).
   - T is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely absent: R, O, S, E, P, L, N
- Letters definitely present: A, T
- Positions ruled out for A: 1 and 3
- Position ruled out for T: 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and T.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, P, L, N.
- A cannot be in position 1 or 3.
- T cannot be in position 5.

Remaining common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: A (already known), I, U.

Let’s try to build a word:
- A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- T must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Good candidate letters: A, T, C, D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try “MATHS” – but S is excluded.
“HATCH” – H, A, T, C, H. S is excluded, but H is allowed, C is allowed. A is in position 2, T is in position 3. This seems valid:
- Contains A and T.
- No R, O, S, E, P, L, N.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- T is in position 3 (allowed).

Another candidate: “GAULT” – G, A, U, L, T. But L is excluded.
“CATCH” – C, A, T, C, H. A is in position 2, T is in position 3. Valid.
“WASTE” – E is excluded.
“MUTCH” – M, U, T, C, H. Contains T but no A – invalid.
“VATIK” – K is allowed, but A is in position 2, T is in position 3. Valid.

Among these, “HATCH” seems good because it uses H, A, T, C, H – all allowed letters, and positions are valid.

But let’s check “CATCH” – C, A, T, C, H. This also seems good.

Between “HATCH” and “CATCH”, both are valid. “CATCH” uses C, A, T, C, H – all allowed. I’ll go with “CATCH”.

However, let’s verify:
- Letters in CATCH: C, A, T, C, H. None of R, O, S, E, P, L, N appear.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- T is in position 3 (allowed).
- No other letters are ruled out.

So “CATCH” is a valid next guess.

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is somewhere else).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

We now know:
1. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
2. It DOES contain A, but not in the first position.

Since we can't use R, O, S, E, we need a new set of common consonants and vowels. The remaining common vowels are I and U, and common consonants include T, N, L, C, D, etc. 

A good next guess should:
- Include A (but not in position 1).
- Avoid R, O, S, E.
- Use other common letters to maximize information.

""UNTIL"" is a strong candidate:
- It has A (but we don't need it here; let's try another vowel set).
- Let's try ""AUDIO"" - but O is excluded.
- How about ""UNITY"" - but it has U and I, which are good, but no A.
- Let's try ""ALERT"" - but R is excluded.
- ""ADMIT"" - uses A, D, M, I, T. All letters are allowed (R, O, S, E are excluded, but A is allowed). A is in position 1 here, but we know A is not in position 1 from the feedback. So A can't be in position 1, but can be in 2-5. So ""ADMIT"" has A in position 1 - bad choice.
- ""PLANT"" - has A in position 3. This is acceptable since A can be in positions 2-5. It also uses P, L, N, T - all allowed letters.

Another option is ""BLAND"" - B, L, A, N, D. A is in position 3 - acceptable. Uses common letters.

Between ""PLANT"" and ""BLAND"", both are good. ""PLANT"" uses P, L, A, N, T - all allowed. ""BLAND"" uses B, L, A, N, D - also good.

I'll go with ""PLANT"" as it uses P, L, A, N, T - giving us coverage of several consonants and the known A.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: plant -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(-)

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. plant → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(-)
   - P, L, N are NOT in the word.
   - A is still in the word but not in position 3 (because in plant it was in position 3 and got “-”).
   - T is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely absent: R, O, S, E, P, L, N
- Letters definitely present: A, T
- Positions ruled out for A: 1 and 3
- Position ruled out for T: 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and T.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, P, L, N.
- A cannot be in position 1 or 3.
- T cannot be in position 5.

Remaining common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: A (already known), I, U.

Let’s try to build a word:
- A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- T must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Good candidate letters: A, T, C, D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try “MATHS” – but S is excluded.
“HATCH” – H, A, T, C, H. S is excluded, but H is allowed, C is allowed. A is in position 2, T is in position 3. This seems valid:
- Contains A and T.
- No R, O, S, E, P, L, N.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- T is in position 3 (allowed).

Another candidate: “GAULT” – G, A, U, L, T. But L is excluded.
“CATCH” – C, A, T, C, H. A is in position 2, T is in position 3. Valid.
“WASTE” – E is excluded.
“MUTCH” – M, U, T, C, H. Contains T but no A – invalid.
“VATIK” – K is allowed, but A is in position 2, T is in position 3. Valid.

Among these, “HATCH” seems good because it uses H, A, T, C, H – all allowed letters, and positions are valid.

But let’s check “CATCH” – C, A, T, C, H. This also seems good.

Between “HATCH” and “CATCH”, both are valid. “CATCH” uses C, A, T, C, H – all allowed. I’ll go with “CATCH”.

However, let’s verify:
- Letters in CATCH: C, A, T, C, H. None of R, O, S, E, P, L, N appear.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- T is in position 3 (allowed).
- No other letters are ruled out.

So “CATCH” is a valid next guess.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2 and T in position 3.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
- Has valid letters for positions 1, 4, 5.

Possible patterns: ? A T ? ?

Looking at common words:
- B A T ? ? → BAT?? – but we need 5 letters. “BATON” – but O is excluded.
- G A T ? ? → “GAT??” – “GATE” has E excluded.
- M A T ? ? → “MATE” – E excluded.
- D A T ? ? → “DAT??” – not common.
- F A T ? ? → “FAT??” – “FATTY” – Y is allowed, but double T is possible.
- V A T ? ? → “VAT??” – V is allowed, but we need 5 letters.

Let’s list possible letters for positions 1, 4, 5:
Position 1: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y
Position 4: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y
Position 5: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y

We need common words fitting ? A T ? ?. Let me think of common words:
- “MADAM” – but A is in position 2, so M A D A M – but A is in position 2 and 4, and T is missing.
- “WAT?” – W A T ? ? – “WATER” – E excluded.
- “FATTY” – F A T T Y – T is allowed twice, Y is allowed. This seems valid.
- “VATIK” – K is allowed, but “VATIK” is not a common word.
- “GATTO” – O is excluded.
- “BATSY” – S is excluded.
- “MATTE” – E is excluded.

“FATTY” seems the most common word fitting ? A T ? ? with allowed letters.

Check letters: F, A, T, T, Y – none are in the excluded list.
Positions: A in 2, T in 3 – matches ✓.

Therefore, the next guess should be “FATTY”.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
- Has valid letters for positions 1, 4, 5.

Possible patterns: ? A T ? ?

Looking at common words:
- B A T ? ? → BAT?? – but we need 5 letters. “BATON” – but O is excluded.
- G A T ? ? → “GAT??” – “GATE” has E excluded.
- M A T ? ? → “MATE” – E excluded.
- D A T ? ? → “DAT??” – not common.
- F A T ? ? → “FAT??” – “FATTY” – Y is allowed, but double T is possible.
- V A T ? ? → “VAT??” – V is allowed, but we need 5 letters.

Let’s list possible letters for positions 1, 4, 5:
Position 1: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y
Position 4: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y
Position 5: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y

We need common words fitting ? A T ? ?. Let me think of common words:
- “MADAM” – but A is in position 2, so M A D A M – but A is in position 2 and 4, and T is missing.
- “WAT?” – W A T ? ? – “WATER” – E excluded.
- “FATTY” – F A T T Y – T is allowed twice, Y is allowed. This seems valid.
- “VATIK” – K is allowed, but “VATIK” is not a common word.
- “GATTO” – O is excluded.
- “BATSY” – S is excluded.
- “MATTE” – E is excluded.

“FATTY” seems the most common word fitting ? A T ? ? with allowed letters.

Check letters: F, A, T, T, Y – none are in the excluded list.
Positions: A in 2, T in 3 – matches ✓.

Therefore, the next guess should be “FATTY”.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers a good range of vowels and consonants. This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good starting word often includes common letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. 

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word right away.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on ""arose"":
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is somewhere else).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

We now know:
1. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E.
2. It DOES contain A, but not in the first position.

Since we can't use R, O, S, E, we need a new set of common consonants and vowels. The remaining common vowels are I and U, and common consonants include T, N, L, C, D, etc. 

A good next guess should:
- Include A (but not in position 1).
- Avoid R, O, S, E.
- Use other common letters to maximize information.

""UNTIL"" is a strong candidate:
- It has A (but we don't need it here; let's try another vowel set).
- Let's try ""AUDIO"" - but O is excluded.
- How about ""UNITY"" - but it has U and I, which are good, but no A.
- Let's try ""ALERT"" - but R is excluded.
- ""ADMIT"" - uses A, D, M, I, T. All letters are allowed (R, O, S, E are excluded, but A is allowed). A is in position 1 here, but we know A is not in position 1 from the feedback. So A can't be in position 1, but can be in 2-5. So ""ADMIT"" has A in position 1 - bad choice.
- ""PLANT"" - has A in position 3. This is acceptable since A can be in positions 2-5. It also uses P, L, N, T - all allowed letters.

Another option is ""BLAND"" - B, L, A, N, D. A is in position 3 - acceptable. Uses common letters.

Between ""PLANT"" and ""BLAND"", both are good. ""PLANT"" uses P, L, A, N, T - all allowed. ""BLAND"" uses B, L, A, N, D - also good.

I'll go with ""PLANT"" as it uses P, L, A, N, T - giving us coverage of several consonants and the known A.

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
   - A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, O, S, E are NOT in the word.

2. plant → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(-)
   - P, L, N are NOT in the word.
   - A is still in the word but not in position 3 (because in plant it was in position 3 and got “-”).
   - T is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely absent: R, O, S, E, P, L, N
- Letters definitely present: A, T
- Positions ruled out for A: 1 and 3
- Position ruled out for T: 5

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains both A and T.
- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, P, L, N.
- A cannot be in position 1 or 3.
- T cannot be in position 5.

Remaining common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.
Remaining vowels: A (already known), I, U.

Let’s try to build a word:
- A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
- T must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Good candidate letters: A, T, C, D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y.

Let’s try “MATHS” – but S is excluded.
“HATCH” – H, A, T, C, H. S is excluded, but H is allowed, C is allowed. A is in position 2, T is in position 3. This seems valid:
- Contains A and T.
- No R, O, S, E, P, L, N.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- T is in position 3 (allowed).

Another candidate: “GAULT” – G, A, U, L, T. But L is excluded.
“CATCH” – C, A, T, C, H. A is in position 2, T is in position 3. Valid.
“WASTE” – E is excluded.
“MUTCH” – M, U, T, C, H. Contains T but no A – invalid.
“VATIK” – K is allowed, but A is in position 2, T is in position 3. Valid.

Among these, “HATCH” seems good because it uses H, A, T, C, H – all allowed letters, and positions are valid.

But let’s check “CATCH” – C, A, T, C, H. This also seems good.

Between “HATCH” and “CATCH”, both are valid. “CATCH” uses C, A, T, C, H – all allowed. I’ll go with “CATCH”.

However, let’s verify:
- Letters in CATCH: C, A, T, C, H. None of R, O, S, E, P, L, N appear.
- A is in position 2 (allowed).
- T is in position 3 (allowed).
- No other letters are ruled out.

So “CATCH” is a valid next guess.

- Letters definitely present: A (position 2), T (position 3)
- Remaining allowed letters: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has A in position 2 and T in position 3.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.
- Has valid letters for positions 1, 4, 5.

Possible patterns: ? A T ? ?

Looking at common words:
- B A T ? ? → BAT?? – but we need 5 letters. “BATON” – but O is excluded.
- G A T ? ? → “GAT??” – “GATE” has E excluded.
- M A T ? ? → “MATE” – E excluded.
- D A T ? ? → “DAT??” – not common.
- F A T ? ? → “FAT??” – “FATTY” – Y is allowed, but double T is possible.
- V A T ? ? → “VAT??” – V is allowed, but we need 5 letters.

Let’s list possible letters for positions 1, 4, 5:
Position 1: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y
Position 4: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y
Position 5: B, D, F, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y

We need common words fitting ? A T ? ?. Let me think of common words:
- “MADAM” – but A is in position 2, so M A D A M – but A is in position 2 and 4, and T is missing.
- “WAT?” – W A T ? ? – “WATER” – E excluded.
- “FATTY” – F A T T Y – T is allowed twice, Y is allowed. This seems valid.
- “VATIK” – K is allowed, but “VATIK” is not a common word.
- “GATTO” – O is excluded.
- “BATSY” – S is excluded.
- “MATTE” – E is excluded.

“FATTY” seems the most common word fitting ? A T ? ? with allowed letters.

Check letters: F, A, T, T, Y – none are in the excluded list.
Positions: A in 2, T in 3 – matches ✓.

Therefore, the next guess should be “FATTY”.

This helps maximize the information gained from the feedback. A good starting word often includes common letters like E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, etc. \n\nLooking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains three very common vowels (A, O, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This gives us a good chance of hitting multiple letters in the secret word right away.\n\n<guess>arose</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on ""arose"":\n- A is in the word but in the wrong position (so A is somewhere else).\n- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.\n\nWe now know:\n1. The word does NOT contain R, O, S, E.\n2. It DOES contain A, but not in the first position.\n\nSince we can\'t use R, O, S, E, we need a new set of common consonants and vowels. The remaining common vowels are I and U, and common consonants include T, N, L, C, D, etc. \n\nA good next guess should:\n- Include A (but not in position 1).\n- Avoid R, O, S, E.\n- Use other common letters to maximize information.\n\n""UNTIL"" is a strong candidate:\n- It has A (but we don\'t need it here; let\'s try another vowel set).\n- Let\'s try ""AUDIO"" - but O is excluded.\n- How about ""UNITY"" - but it has U and I, which are good, but no A.\n- Let\'s try ""ALERT"" - but R is excluded.\n- ""ADMIT"" - uses A, D, M, I, T. All letters are allowed (R, O, S, E are excluded, but A is allowed). A is in position 1 here, but we know A is not in position 1 from the feedback. So A can\'t be in position 1, but can be in 2-5. So ""ADMIT"" has A in position 1 - bad choice.\n- ""PLANT"" - has A in position 3. This is acceptable since A can be in positions 2-5. It also uses P, L, N, T - all allowed letters.\n\nAnother option is ""BLAND"" - B, L, A, N, D. A is in position 3 - acceptable. Uses common letters.\n\nBetween ""PLANT"" and ""BLAND"", both are good. ""PLANT"" uses P, L, A, N, T - all allowed. ""BLAND"" uses B, L, A, N, D - also good.\n\nI\'ll go with ""PLANT"" as it uses P, L, A, N, T - giving us coverage of several consonants and the known A.\n\n<guess>plant</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: plant -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the two rounds of feedback we have:\n\n1. arose → A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)\n   - A is in the word but not in position 1.\n   - R, O, S, E are NOT in the word.\n\n2. plant → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(x) T(-)\n   - P, L, N are NOT in the word.\n   - A is still in the word but not in position 3 (because in plant it was in position 3 and got “-”).\n   - T is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nSo far we know:\n- Letters definitely absent: R, O, S, E, P, L, N\n- Letters definitely present: A, T\n- Positions ruled out for A: 1 and 3\n- Position ruled out for T: 5\n\nWe need a 5-letter word that:\n- Contains both A and T.\n- Does NOT contain R, O, S, E, P, L, N.\n- A cannot be in position 1 or 3.\n- T cannot be in position 5.\n\nRemaining common consonants: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, V, W, Y, etc.\nRemaining vowels: A (already known), I, U.\n\nLet’s try to build a word:\n- A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.\n- T must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nGood candidate letters: A, T, C, D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y.\n\nLet’s try “MATHS” – but S is excluded.\n“HATCH” – H, A, T, C, H.
