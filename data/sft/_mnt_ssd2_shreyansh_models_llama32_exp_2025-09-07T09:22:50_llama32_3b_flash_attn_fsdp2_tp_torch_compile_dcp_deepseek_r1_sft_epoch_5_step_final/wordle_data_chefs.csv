We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
 - R is not in the word at all.
 - A is not in the word at all.
 - N is not in the word at all.
 - E is in the word but in the wrong position (so E is present, but not at position 5).

 Therefore, we know:
 - The first letter is C.
 - The word does not contain R, A, or N.
 - The word contains E, but not at the end (position 5).

 Since the first letter is C, the word starts with C.

 We also know that E is in the word, but not at position 5. Since the first letter is C, E must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4.

 Additionally, we must avoid the letters R, A, N.

 For the next guess, we want to use the known information and try to find a word that:
 - Starts with C (because position 1 is fixed as C).
 - Contains E in positions 2, 3, or 4 (but not position 5).
 - Does not contain R, A, N.

 We also want to test new letters to get more information.

 Let's think of words that start with C and have an E in them (but not at the end). Also, we should avoid R, A, N.

 Possible positions for E: we can try to put E in position 2, 3, or 4.

 We also want to include other common letters that we haven't tried yet. We have used C, R, A, N, E. So we should avoid R, A, N and reuse E (but not at position 5) and we can use new letters.

 Since E is in the word but not at position 5, we can try to put E in position 2, 3, or 4. But note: we don't know which one, so we might want to test multiple possibilities.

 However, we have only 5 letters to work with and we know the first letter is C.

 Let's try to form a word that starts with C and has E in position 2, 3, or 4, and uses new letters.

 We also note that we have eliminated R, A, N. So we must avoid these.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, etc.

 We can try to put E in position 2: then the word would be C E _ _ _

 But we don't know the remaining letters. We can try a word like ""CEILS"" but that is not a word. We need valid words.

 Let's think of words that start with C and have an E:

 Option 1: E in position 2 -> words like ""CELEB"" (not valid), ""CELLO"" (but we have two L's? and we don't know if L is in the word) -> but note: we have to avoid R, A, N.

 ""CELLO"": C E L L O -> but we have two L's. Also, we don't know if L is in the word. But we can try.

 However, we want to maximize new letters. Also, note that we have only 5 positions and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another idea: since we know E is in the word (but not at position 5) and we know the first letter is C, we can try to put E in position 3 or 4 and use new letters for the other positions.

 Let's list some words that start with C and have an E, and avoid R, A, N.

 Some possibilities:
 - C with E in position 2: ""CE"" + three letters (not R, A, N). Examples: ""CEDED"" (but D is new, and we have E again? but we don't know if D is in the word). However, we are allowed to reuse E? But note: the feedback for E was a minus, meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. It doesn't say anything about having multiple E's. So we can have multiple E's? But we don't know. However, the feedback only marked one E as present (but wrong position). So if we use two E's, we might get more information.

 But we must avoid R, A, N. So for ""CEDED"": C E D E D -> but we have two E's and two D's. It's a valid word. However, we are not sure if the secret word has two E's and two D's.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position and uses common consonants.

 Another common word: ""CHEST"" -> but we have E in position 2? Actually, ""CHEST"" is C H E S T. So E is in position 3. Also, we avoid R, A, N? H, E, S, T: no R, A, N. But note: we have E in position 3. Also, we can test H, S, T.

 However, we must consider that the feedback for E was a minus meaning it is present but not at position 5. So in ""CHEST"", E is at position 3, which is allowed.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess ""crane"" had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has an E, but not at position 5. It doesn't say anything about having E at position 3. So that's allowed.

 However, we also know that the secret word does not have R, A, N. So ""CHEST"" is acceptable.

 But let me check: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in position 4? For example: ""CLOTE"" (but is that a word? not really). Or ""CUPTE"" (not a word).

 How about ""CHEWY""? But that has E at position 3? Actually, ""CHEWY"" is C H E W Y -> E at position 3.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CELLO"": C E L L O -> E at position 2.

 But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to get as much information as possible.

 Since we know the first letter is C and we know E is present (but not at position 5), we can try to use a word that has E in a new position and tests other common letters.

 Let me think of a word that starts with C, has E in position 3 or 4, and uses new letters.

 Another idea: ""CABLE"" -> but we have A? We know A is not in the word (from the first feedback: A was marked as absent). So we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, R, N.

 So ""CABLE"" is invalid because it has A.

 How about ""CEDED""? As I thought earlier: C E D E D -> but that has two E's and two D's. It's a valid word. But we are using E in position 2 and 4? We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are using D.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CHILE"": C H I L E -> but E is at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5 (from the first feedback: E was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position, meaning it is in the word but not at position 5). So we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting E at position 5.

 Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting E at position 5.

 So ""CHILE"" has E at position 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""CHEST"": C H E S T -> E at position 3. This is acceptable.

 Another option: ""CUBES"": C U B E S -> E at position 4. This is also acceptable.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, N. Both ""CHEST"" and ""CUBES"" avoid these.

 Let me choose ""CHEST"" because it has common letters: H, E, S, T. And we can test H, S, T.

 So the next guess: ""CHEST""

 However, note: we are not sure if the word has H, S, T. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has E in position 2, such as ""CELLO"". But ""CELLO"" uses L and O, which are new.

 But we have two good candidates: ""CHEST"" and ""CELLO"".

 Which one gives more information? 
 - ""CHEST"": tests H, E, S, T (with E at position 3).
 - ""CELLO"": tests E, L, L, O (with E at position 2).

 Then we can compare:

 We know the word has E, so we are testing 4 new letters in ""CHEST"" (H, S, T) and 4 new letters in ""CELLO"" (L, O, and one L and one O). Actually, ""CELLO"" has two L's and two O's? Wait: ""CELLO"" is C E L L O -> two L's and one O.

 We want to maximize the number of new distinct letters? Because we don't know anything about the other four letters.

 I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice because it tests four distinct new letters: H, E, S, T.

 But note: we are reusing E, but that's okay because we are trying to find its position.

 However, we are avoiding R, A, N.

 So I'll go with ""CHEST"".

 But wait: what if the word has E at position 2? Then by putting E at position 3 (as in ""CHEST"") we might get a minus again? But we are testing other positions.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in a position we haven't tried (position 2) to see if it's there.

 Since we know E is present but not at position 5, we can try position 2.

 So let me consider ""CELLO"": 
   C E L L O -> positions: C(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), O(5)

 But note: we know the first letter is C, so we are testing E at position 2. Also, we are testing L and O.

 However, we are using two L's. If the word has only one L, then we might get confusing feedback? But we'll see.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CEILT"" (but that's not a common word) or ""CELEB"" (not valid).

 Another common word: ""CEMENT"" -> but that has E at position 2 and 4? And we avoid R, A, N? M, E, N, T: but we have N? We know N is not in the word! So we cannot use N.

 So ""CEMENT"" is invalid because of N.

 How about ""CELTS"": C E L T S -> E at position 2, and tests L, T, S.

 That's a valid word.

 But we have two options: ""CHEST"", ""CELTS"", ""CELLO"", etc.

 I think ""CELTS"" is a good choice because it tests three new letters (L, T, S) and we avoid the forbidden letters.

 However, we are putting E at position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in position 4? For example: ""CUPHE"" (not common) or ""CABLE"" (has A, invalid) -> ""CABLE"" is invalid because of A.

 Another word: ""CURED"" -> but has R? We know R is not in the word -> invalid.

 How about ""CUBES"": C U B E S -> E at position 4. This tests U, B, E, S.

 But we have E at position 4? We don't know if that's the correct position, but we are testing.

 We have to choose one.

 Let me think about the frequency of letters. We want to test common letters.

 S, T, L are very common. So ""CHEST"" or ""CELTS"" or ""CELLO"".

 I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice because it tests S and T as well.

 But note: we have already eliminated A, R, N. So we are left with many letters.

 I'll go with ""CHEST"".

 However, wait: the word must be 5 letters and we are avoiding R, A, N. So ""CHEST"" is acceptable.

 So the next guess: ""CHEST""

 But note: we are putting E at position 3. We know E is in the word but not at position 5. Position 3 is a new position.

 However, we must be cautious: if the word has two E's, we might get multiple minuses? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't reuse E? But we know E is in the word, so we should use E to test its position.

 But we are allowed to reuse E? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient? However, we are testing the position of E.

 So I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice.

 However, let me check if there is a word that uses E in a different position and also tests other common letters.

 Another candidate: ""CLOSE"" -> but that has O and S, and E at the end? We cannot put E at the end.

 How about ""CLOUD"": but that doesn't have E? We must include E because we know it's in the word? Actually, we don't have to include E? But if we don't include E, we won't get information about E's position. So we should include E.

 We know E is present, so we must include E in the guess? Actually, no. We can guess without E? But then we wouldn't get information about E's position. So it's better to include E.

 So I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice.

 Let me write it: C H E S T

 But wait: what if the word has E in position 2? Then we get a check for E? But we are putting E in position 3? Actually, in ""CHEST"", E is in position 3.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 2: ""CELTS"" (C E L T S) or ""CEILS"" (C E I L S). But ""CEILS"" is not a common word? Actually, ""CEILS"" is not valid. ""CELEB"" is not valid.

 Another word: ""CESTI"" (not common) or ""CESTI"" is not valid.

 How about ""CETYL"" (C E T Y L) -> but that's not very common.

 I think ""CELTS"" is a good alternative: it tests E at position 2 and L, T, S.

 But we have two good candidates: ""CHEST"" and ""CELTS"".

 I'll choose ""CELTS"" because it tests E in a new position (position 2) and we get to test L, T, S.

 So the next guess: ""CELTS""

 But note: we are putting E at position 2. We know E is in the word, but we don't know if it's at position 2. If we get a check for E, then we know it's at position 2. If we get a minus, then E is in the word but not at position 2 (so it must be at 3 or 4). If we get an x, that would be a contradiction because we know E is in the word? But we shouldn't get an x.

 Actually, we know E is in the word, so we expect either a check (if it's at position 2) or a minus (if it's in the word but not at 2). But note: we have two E's in ""CELTS""? No, only one E.

 ""CELTS"": C E L T S -> one E.

 So we are testing E at position 2 and the letters L, T, S.

 This seems good.

 But wait: what if the word has E at position 4? Then in ""CELTS"", the E at position 2 would be a minus? And we would know that E is not at position 2, so it must be at 3 or 4? But we are testing position 2 first.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 4? For example: ""CUPHE"" is not common. ""CABLE"" is invalid. ""CEDED"" is valid: C E D E D -> but we have E at position 2 and 4? Actually, position 2 is E and position 4 is E? But we don't know if the word has two E's.

 I think ""CELTS"" is a solid choice.

 But note: we are testing 4 new letters. That's good.

 So I'll go with ""CELTS"".

 However, let me check: we have the following constraints:
 - Position 1: C (fixed)
 - The word must contain E (but not at position 5) and we are putting E at position 2.
 - We are avoiding R, A, N.

 So ""CELTS"" is acceptable.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""CELTS"".

 But wait: what if the word has E at position 4? Then we are not testing position 4? But we will get feedback on E: if we get a minus for E, then we know E is not at position 2, so it must be at 3 or 4. And if we get a check for E, then we know it's at position 2.

 So we are learning about E's position.

 Similarly, we are testing L, T, S.

 So let's go with ""CELTS"".

<guess>celts</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- **R**, **A**, and **N** are absent (x).
- **E** is present but not in position 5 (-).

Key deductions:
1. The secret word starts with **C**.
2. **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4).
3. The word **excludes R, A, N**.
4. We need to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, O) while probing **E**'s position.

For the next guess:
- Must start with **C**.
- Must include **E** in position 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).
- Must avoid **R, A, N**.
- Should test high-frequency letters to maximize information.

**Strategy**: Test **E** in position 2 (to check if it's correct) and introduce new common letters: **L, T, S**. The word **""CELTS""** fits:
- Starts with **C**.
- Places **E** in position 2 (to test if correct).
- Uses new letters **L, T, S** (all untested).
- Avoids forbidden letters (R, A, N).

This guess will help narrow down **E**'s position and test three new letters.

<guess>celts</guess>",celts,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
 - R is not in the word at all.
 - A is not in the word at all.
 - N is not in the word at all.
 - E is in the word but in the wrong position (so E is present, but not at position 5).

 Therefore, we know:
 - The first letter is C.
 - The word does not contain R, A, or N.
 - The word contains E, but not at the end (position 5).

 Since the first letter is C, the word starts with C.

 We also know that E is in the word, but not at position 5. Since the first letter is C, E must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4.

 Additionally, we must avoid the letters R, A, N.

 For the next guess, we want to use the known information and try to find a word that:
 - Starts with C (because position 1 is fixed as C).
 - Contains E in positions 2, 3, or 4 (but not position 5).
 - Does not contain R, A, N.

 We also want to test new letters to get more information.

 Let's think of words that start with C and have an E in them (but not at the end). Also, we should avoid R, A, N.

 Possible positions for E: we can try to put E in position 2, 3, or 4.

 We also want to include other common letters that we haven't tried yet. We have used C, R, A, N, E. So we should avoid R, A, N and reuse E (but not at position 5) and we can use new letters.

 Since E is in the word but not at position 5, we can try to put E in position 2, 3, or 4. But note: we don't know which one, so we might want to test multiple possibilities.

 However, we have only 5 letters to work with and we know the first letter is C.

 Let's try to form a word that starts with C and has E in position 2, 3, or 4, and uses new letters.

 We also note that we have eliminated R, A, N. So we must avoid these.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, etc.

 We can try to put E in position 2: then the word would be C E _ _ _

 But we don't know the remaining letters. We can try a word like ""CEILS"" but that is not a word. We need valid words.

 Let's think of words that start with C and have an E:

 Option 1: E in position 2 -> words like ""CELEB"" (not valid), ""CELLO"" (but we have two L's? and we don't know if L is in the word) -> but note: we have to avoid R, A, N.

 ""CELLO"": C E L L O -> but we have two L's. Also, we don't know if L is in the word. But we can try.

 However, we want to maximize new letters. Also, note that we have only 5 positions and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another idea: since we know E is in the word (but not at position 5) and we know the first letter is C, we can try to put E in position 3 or 4 and use new letters for the other positions.

 Let's list some words that start with C and have an E, and avoid R, A, N.

 Some possibilities:
 - C with E in position 2: ""CE"" + three letters (not R, A, N). Examples: ""CEDED"" (but D is new, and we have E again? but we don't know if D is in the word). However, we are allowed to reuse E? But note: the feedback for E was a minus, meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. It doesn't say anything about having multiple E's. So we can have multiple E's? But we don't know. However, the feedback only marked one E as present (but wrong position). So if we use two E's, we might get more information.

 But we must avoid R, A, N. So for ""CEDED"": C E D E D -> but we have two E's and two D's. It's a valid word. However, we are not sure if the secret word has two E's and two D's.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position and uses common consonants.

 Another common word: ""CHEST"" -> but we have E in position 2? Actually, ""CHEST"" is C H E S T. So E is in position 3. Also, we avoid R, A, N? H, E, S, T: no R, A, N. But note: we have E in position 3. Also, we can test H, S, T.

 However, we must consider that the feedback for E was a minus meaning it is present but not at position 5. So in ""CHEST"", E is at position 3, which is allowed.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess ""crane"" had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has an E, but not at position 5. It doesn't say anything about having E at position 3. So that's allowed.

 However, we also know that the secret word does not have R, A, N. So ""CHEST"" is acceptable.

 But let me check: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in position 4? For example: ""CLOTE"" (but is that a word? not really). Or ""CUPTE"" (not a word).

 How about ""CHEWY""? But that has E at position 3? Actually, ""CHEWY"" is C H E W Y -> E at position 3.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CELLO"": C E L L O -> E at position 2.

 But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to get as much information as possible.

 Since we know the first letter is C and we know E is present (but not at position 5), we can try to use a word that has E in a new position and tests other common letters.

 Let me think of a word that starts with C, has E in position 3 or 4, and uses new letters.

 Another idea: ""CABLE"" -> but we have A? We know A is not in the word (from the first feedback: A was marked as absent). So we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, R, N.

 So ""CABLE"" is invalid because it has A.

 How about ""CEDED""? As I thought earlier: C E D E D -> but that has two E's and two D's. It's a valid word. But we are using E in position 2 and 4? We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are using D.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CHILE"": C H I L E -> but E is at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5 (from the first feedback: E was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position, meaning it is in the word but not at position 5). So we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting E at position 5.

 Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting E at position 5.

 So ""CHILE"" has E at position 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""CHEST"": C H E S T -> E at position 3. This is acceptable.

 Another option: ""CUBES"": C U B E S -> E at position 4. This is also acceptable.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, N. Both ""CHEST"" and ""CUBES"" avoid these.

 Let me choose ""CHEST"" because it has common letters: H, E, S, T. And we can test H, S, T.

 So the next guess: ""CHEST""

 However, note: we are not sure if the word has H, S, T. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has E in position 2, such as ""CELLO"". But ""CELLO"" uses L and O, which are new.

 But we have two good candidates: ""CHEST"" and ""CELLO"".

 Which one gives more information? 
 - ""CHEST"": tests H, E, S, T (with E at position 3).
 - ""CELLO"": tests E, L, L, O (with E at position 2).

 Then we can compare:

 We know the word has E, so we are testing 4 new letters in ""CHEST"" (H, S, T) and 4 new letters in ""CELLO"" (L, O, and one L and one O). Actually, ""CELLO"" has two L's and two O's? Wait: ""CELLO"" is C E L L O -> two L's and one O.

 We want to maximize the number of new distinct letters? Because we don't know anything about the other four letters.

 I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice because it tests four distinct new letters: H, E, S, T.

 But note: we are reusing E, but that's okay because we are trying to find its position.

 However, we are avoiding R, A, N.

 So I'll go with ""CHEST"".

 But wait: what if the word has E at position 2? Then by putting E at position 3 (as in ""CHEST"") we might get a minus again? But we are testing other positions.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in a position we haven't tried (position 2) to see if it's there.

 Since we know E is present but not at position 5, we can try position 2.

 So let me consider ""CELLO"": 
   C E L L O -> positions: C(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), O(5)

 But note: we know the first letter is C, so we are testing E at position 2. Also, we are testing L and O.

 However, we are using two L's. If the word has only one L, then we might get confusing feedback? But we'll see.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CEILT"" (but that's not a common word) or ""CELEB"" (not valid).

 Another common word: ""CEMENT"" -> but that has E at position 2 and 4? And we avoid R, A, N? M, E, N, T: but we have N? We know N is not in the word! So we cannot use N.

 So ""CEMENT"" is invalid because of N.

 How about ""CELTS"": C E L T S -> E at position 2, and tests L, T, S.

 That's a valid word.

 But we have two options: ""CHEST"", ""CELTS"", ""CELLO"", etc.

 I think ""CELTS"" is a good choice because it tests three new letters (L, T, S) and we avoid the forbidden letters.

 However, we are putting E at position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in position 4? For example: ""CUPHE"" (not common) or ""CABLE"" (has A, invalid) -> ""CABLE"" is invalid because of A.

 Another word: ""CURED"" -> but has R? We know R is not in the word -> invalid.

 How about ""CUBES"": C U B E S -> E at position 4. This tests U, B, E, S.

 But we have E at position 4? We don't know if that's the correct position, but we are testing.

 We have to choose one.

 Let me think about the frequency of letters. We want to test common letters.

 S, T, L are very common. So ""CHEST"" or ""CELTS"" or ""CELLO"".

 I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice because it tests S and T as well.

 But note: we have already eliminated A, R, N. So we are left with many letters.

 I'll go with ""CHEST"".

 However, wait: the word must be 5 letters and we are avoiding R, A, N. So ""CHEST"" is acceptable.

 So the next guess: ""CHEST""

 But note: we are putting E at position 3. We know E is in the word but not at position 5. Position 3 is a new position.

 However, we must be cautious: if the word has two E's, we might get multiple minuses? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't reuse E? But we know E is in the word, so we should use E to test its position.

 But we are allowed to reuse E? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient? However, we are testing the position of E.

 So I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice.

 However, let me check if there is a word that uses E in a different position and also tests other common letters.

 Another candidate: ""CLOSE"" -> but that has O and S, and E at the end? We cannot put E at the end.

 How about ""CLOUD"": but that doesn't have E? We must include E because we know it's in the word? Actually, we don't have to include E? But if we don't include E, we won't get information about E's position. So we should include E.

 We know E is present, so we must include E in the guess? Actually, no. We can guess without E? But then we wouldn't get information about E's position. So it's better to include E.

 So I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice.

 Let me write it: C H E S T

 But wait: what if the word has E in position 2? Then we get a check for E? But we are putting E in position 3? Actually, in ""CHEST"", E is in position 3.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 2: ""CELTS"" (C E L T S) or ""CEILS"" (C E I L S). But ""CEILS"" is not a common word? Actually, ""CEILS"" is not valid. ""CELEB"" is not valid.

 Another word: ""CESTI"" (not common) or ""CESTI"" is not valid.

 How about ""CETYL"" (C E T Y L) -> but that's not very common.

 I think ""CELTS"" is a good alternative: it tests E at position 2 and L, T, S.

 But we have two good candidates: ""CHEST"" and ""CELTS"".

 I'll choose ""CELTS"" because it tests E in a new position (position 2) and we get to test L, T, S.

 So the next guess: ""CELTS""

 But note: we are putting E at position 2. We know E is in the word, but we don't know if it's at position 2. If we get a check for E, then we know it's at position 2. If we get a minus, then E is in the word but not at position 2 (so it must be at 3 or 4). If we get an x, that would be a contradiction because we know E is in the word? But we shouldn't get an x.

 Actually, we know E is in the word, so we expect either a check (if it's at position 2) or a minus (if it's in the word but not at 2). But note: we have two E's in ""CELTS""? No, only one E.

 ""CELTS"": C E L T S -> one E.

 So we are testing E at position 2 and the letters L, T, S.

 This seems good.

 But wait: what if the word has E at position 4? Then in ""CELTS"", the E at position 2 would be a minus? And we would know that E is not at position 2, so it must be at 3 or 4? But we are testing position 2 first.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 4? For example: ""CUPHE"" is not common. ""CABLE"" is invalid. ""CEDED"" is valid: C E D E D -> but we have E at position 2 and 4? Actually, position 2 is E and position 4 is E? But we don't know if the word has two E's.

 I think ""CELTS"" is a solid choice.

 But note: we are testing 4 new letters. That's good.

 So I'll go with ""CELTS"".

 However, let me check: we have the following constraints:
 - Position 1: C (fixed)
 - The word must contain E (but not at position 5) and we are putting E at position 2.
 - We are avoiding R, A, N.

 So ""CELTS"" is acceptable.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""CELTS"".

 But wait: what if the word has E at position 4? Then we are not testing position 4? But we will get feedback on E: if we get a minus for E, then we know E is not at position 2, so it must be at 3 or 4. And if we get a check for E, then we know it's at position 2.

 So we are learning about E's position.

 Similarly, we are testing L, T, S.

 So let's go with ""CELTS"".

<guess>celts</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- **R**, **A**, and **N** are absent (x).
- **E** is present but not in position 5 (-).

Key deductions:
1. The secret word starts with **C**.
2. **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4).
3. The word **excludes R, A, N**.
4. We need to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, O) while probing **E**'s position.

For the next guess:
- Must start with **C**.
- Must include **E** in position 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).
- Must avoid **R, A, N**.
- Should test high-frequency letters to maximize information.

**Strategy**: Test **E** in position 2 (to check if it's correct) and introduce new common letters: **L, T, S**. The word **""CELTS""** fits:
- Starts with **C**.
- Places **E** in position 2 (to test if correct).
- Uses new letters **L, T, S** (all untested).
- Avoids forbidden letters (R, A, N).

This guess will help narrow down **E**'s position and test three new letters.",Guess 2: celts -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) E(-) L(x) T(x) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
 - R is not in the word at all.
 - A is not in the word at all.
 - N is not in the word at all.
 - E is in the word but in the wrong position (so E is present, but not at position 5).

 Therefore, we know:
 - The first letter is C.
 - The word does not contain R, A, or N.
 - The word contains E, but not at the end (position 5).

 Since the first letter is C, the word starts with C.

 We also know that E is in the word, but not at position 5. Since the first letter is C, E must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4.

 Additionally, we must avoid the letters R, A, N.

 For the next guess, we want to use the known information and try to find a word that:
 - Starts with C (because position 1 is fixed as C).
 - Contains E in positions 2, 3, or 4 (but not position 5).
 - Does not contain R, A, N.

 We also want to test new letters to get more information.

 Let's think of words that start with C and have an E in them (but not at the end). Also, we should avoid R, A, N.

 Possible positions for E: we can try to put E in position 2, 3, or 4.

 We also want to include other common letters that we haven't tried yet. We have used C, R, A, N, E. So we should avoid R, A, N and reuse E (but not at position 5) and we can use new letters.

 Since E is in the word but not at position 5, we can try to put E in position 2, 3, or 4. But note: we don't know which one, so we might want to test multiple possibilities.

 However, we have only 5 letters to work with and we know the first letter is C.

 Let's try to form a word that starts with C and has E in position 2, 3, or 4, and uses new letters.

 We also note that we have eliminated R, A, N. So we must avoid these.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, etc.

 We can try to put E in position 2: then the word would be C E _ _ _

 But we don't know the remaining letters. We can try a word like ""CEILS"" but that is not a word. We need valid words.

 Let's think of words that start with C and have an E:

 Option 1: E in position 2 -> words like ""CELEB"" (not valid), ""CELLO"" (but we have two L's? and we don't know if L is in the word) -> but note: we have to avoid R, A, N.

 ""CELLO"": C E L L O -> but we have two L's. Also, we don't know if L is in the word. But we can try.

 However, we want to maximize new letters. Also, note that we have only 5 positions and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another idea: since we know E is in the word (but not at position 5) and we know the first letter is C, we can try to put E in position 3 or 4 and use new letters for the other positions.

 Let's list some words that start with C and have an E, and avoid R, A, N.

 Some possibilities:
 - C with E in position 2: ""CE"" + three letters (not R, A, N). Examples: ""CEDED"" (but D is new, and we have E again? but we don't know if D is in the word). However, we are allowed to reuse E? But note: the feedback for E was a minus, meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. It doesn't say anything about having multiple E's. So we can have multiple E's? But we don't know. However, the feedback only marked one E as present (but wrong position). So if we use two E's, we might get more information.

 But we must avoid R, A, N. So for ""CEDED"": C E D E D -> but we have two E's and two D's. It's a valid word. However, we are not sure if the secret word has two E's and two D's.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position and uses common consonants.

 Another common word: ""CHEST"" -> but we have E in position 2? Actually, ""CHEST"" is C H E S T. So E is in position 3. Also, we avoid R, A, N? H, E, S, T: no R, A, N. But note: we have E in position 3. Also, we can test H, S, T.

 However, we must consider that the feedback for E was a minus meaning it is present but not at position 5. So in ""CHEST"", E is at position 3, which is allowed.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess ""crane"" had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has an E, but not at position 5. It doesn't say anything about having E at position 3. So that's allowed.

 However, we also know that the secret word does not have R, A, N. So ""CHEST"" is acceptable.

 But let me check: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in position 4? For example: ""CLOTE"" (but is that a word? not really). Or ""CUPTE"" (not a word).

 How about ""CHEWY""? But that has E at position 3? Actually, ""CHEWY"" is C H E W Y -> E at position 3.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CELLO"": C E L L O -> E at position 2.

 But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to get as much information as possible.

 Since we know the first letter is C and we know E is present (but not at position 5), we can try to use a word that has E in a new position and tests other common letters.

 Let me think of a word that starts with C, has E in position 3 or 4, and uses new letters.

 Another idea: ""CABLE"" -> but we have A? We know A is not in the word (from the first feedback: A was marked as absent). So we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, R, N.

 So ""CABLE"" is invalid because it has A.

 How about ""CEDED""? As I thought earlier: C E D E D -> but that has two E's and two D's. It's a valid word. But we are using E in position 2 and 4? We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are using D.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CHILE"": C H I L E -> but E is at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5 (from the first feedback: E was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position, meaning it is in the word but not at position 5). So we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting E at position 5.

 Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting E at position 5.

 So ""CHILE"" has E at position 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""CHEST"": C H E S T -> E at position 3. This is acceptable.

 Another option: ""CUBES"": C U B E S -> E at position 4. This is also acceptable.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, N. Both ""CHEST"" and ""CUBES"" avoid these.

 Let me choose ""CHEST"" because it has common letters: H, E, S, T. And we can test H, S, T.

 So the next guess: ""CHEST""

 However, note: we are not sure if the word has H, S, T. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has E in position 2, such as ""CELLO"". But ""CELLO"" uses L and O, which are new.

 But we have two good candidates: ""CHEST"" and ""CELLO"".

 Which one gives more information? 
 - ""CHEST"": tests H, E, S, T (with E at position 3).
 - ""CELLO"": tests E, L, L, O (with E at position 2).

 Then we can compare:

 We know the word has E, so we are testing 4 new letters in ""CHEST"" (H, S, T) and 4 new letters in ""CELLO"" (L, O, and one L and one O). Actually, ""CELLO"" has two L's and two O's? Wait: ""CELLO"" is C E L L O -> two L's and one O.

 We want to maximize the number of new distinct letters? Because we don't know anything about the other four letters.

 I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice because it tests four distinct new letters: H, E, S, T.

 But note: we are reusing E, but that's okay because we are trying to find its position.

 However, we are avoiding R, A, N.

 So I'll go with ""CHEST"".

 But wait: what if the word has E at position 2? Then by putting E at position 3 (as in ""CHEST"") we might get a minus again? But we are testing other positions.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in a position we haven't tried (position 2) to see if it's there.

 Since we know E is present but not at position 5, we can try position 2.

 So let me consider ""CELLO"": 
   C E L L O -> positions: C(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), O(5)

 But note: we know the first letter is C, so we are testing E at position 2. Also, we are testing L and O.

 However, we are using two L's. If the word has only one L, then we might get confusing feedback? But we'll see.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CEILT"" (but that's not a common word) or ""CELEB"" (not valid).

 Another common word: ""CEMENT"" -> but that has E at position 2 and 4? And we avoid R, A, N? M, E, N, T: but we have N? We know N is not in the word! So we cannot use N.

 So ""CEMENT"" is invalid because of N.

 How about ""CELTS"": C E L T S -> E at position 2, and tests L, T, S.

 That's a valid word.

 But we have two options: ""CHEST"", ""CELTS"", ""CELLO"", etc.

 I think ""CELTS"" is a good choice because it tests three new letters (L, T, S) and we avoid the forbidden letters.

 However, we are putting E at position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in position 4? For example: ""CUPHE"" (not common) or ""CABLE"" (has A, invalid) -> ""CABLE"" is invalid because of A.

 Another word: ""CURED"" -> but has R? We know R is not in the word -> invalid.

 How about ""CUBES"": C U B E S -> E at position 4. This tests U, B, E, S.

 But we have E at position 4? We don't know if that's the correct position, but we are testing.

 We have to choose one.

 Let me think about the frequency of letters. We want to test common letters.

 S, T, L are very common. So ""CHEST"" or ""CELTS"" or ""CELLO"".

 I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice because it tests S and T as well.

 But note: we have already eliminated A, R, N. So we are left with many letters.

 I'll go with ""CHEST"".

 However, wait: the word must be 5 letters and we are avoiding R, A, N. So ""CHEST"" is acceptable.

 So the next guess: ""CHEST""

 But note: we are putting E at position 3. We know E is in the word but not at position 5. Position 3 is a new position.

 However, we must be cautious: if the word has two E's, we might get multiple minuses? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't reuse E? But we know E is in the word, so we should use E to test its position.

 But we are allowed to reuse E? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient? However, we are testing the position of E.

 So I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice.

 However, let me check if there is a word that uses E in a different position and also tests other common letters.

 Another candidate: ""CLOSE"" -> but that has O and S, and E at the end? We cannot put E at the end.

 How about ""CLOUD"": but that doesn't have E? We must include E because we know it's in the word? Actually, we don't have to include E? But if we don't include E, we won't get information about E's position. So we should include E.

 We know E is present, so we must include E in the guess? Actually, no. We can guess without E? But then we wouldn't get information about E's position. So it's better to include E.

 So I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice.

 Let me write it: C H E S T

 But wait: what if the word has E in position 2? Then we get a check for E? But we are putting E in position 3? Actually, in ""CHEST"", E is in position 3.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 2: ""CELTS"" (C E L T S) or ""CEILS"" (C E I L S). But ""CEILS"" is not a common word? Actually, ""CEILS"" is not valid. ""CELEB"" is not valid.

 Another word: ""CESTI"" (not common) or ""CESTI"" is not valid.

 How about ""CETYL"" (C E T Y L) -> but that's not very common.

 I think ""CELTS"" is a good alternative: it tests E at position 2 and L, T, S.

 But we have two good candidates: ""CHEST"" and ""CELTS"".

 I'll choose ""CELTS"" because it tests E in a new position (position 2) and we get to test L, T, S.

 So the next guess: ""CELTS""

 But note: we are putting E at position 2. We know E is in the word, but we don't know if it's at position 2. If we get a check for E, then we know it's at position 2. If we get a minus, then E is in the word but not at position 2 (so it must be at 3 or 4). If we get an x, that would be a contradiction because we know E is in the word? But we shouldn't get an x.

 Actually, we know E is in the word, so we expect either a check (if it's at position 2) or a minus (if it's in the word but not at 2). But note: we have two E's in ""CELTS""? No, only one E.

 ""CELTS"": C E L T S -> one E.

 So we are testing E at position 2 and the letters L, T, S.

 This seems good.

 But wait: what if the word has E at position 4? Then in ""CELTS"", the E at position 2 would be a minus? And we would know that E is not at position 2, so it must be at 3 or 4? But we are testing position 2 first.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 4? For example: ""CUPHE"" is not common. ""CABLE"" is invalid. ""CEDED"" is valid: C E D E D -> but we have E at position 2 and 4? Actually, position 2 is E and position 4 is E? But we don't know if the word has two E's.

 I think ""CELTS"" is a solid choice.

 But note: we are testing 4 new letters. That's good.

 So I'll go with ""CELTS"".

 However, let me check: we have the following constraints:
 - Position 1: C (fixed)
 - The word must contain E (but not at position 5) and we are putting E at position 2.
 - We are avoiding R, A, N.

 So ""CELTS"" is acceptable.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""CELTS"".

 But wait: what if the word has E at position 4? Then we are not testing position 4? But we will get feedback on E: if we get a minus for E, then we know E is not at position 2, so it must be at 3 or 4. And if we get a check for E, then we know it's at position 2.

 So we are learning about E's position.

 Similarly, we are testing L, T, S.

 So let's go with ""CELTS"".

<guess>celts</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- **R**, **A**, and **N** are absent (x).
- **E** is present but not in position 5 (-).

Key deductions:
1. The secret word starts with **C**.
2. **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4).
3. The word **excludes R, A, N**.
4. We need to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, O) while probing **E**'s position.

For the next guess:
- Must start with **C**.
- Must include **E** in position 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).
- Must avoid **R, A, N**.
- Should test high-frequency letters to maximize information.

**Strategy**: Test **E** in position 2 (to check if it's correct) and introduce new common letters: **L, T, S**. The word **""CELTS""** fits:
- Starts with **C**.
- Places **E** in position 2 (to test if correct).
- Uses new letters **L, T, S** (all untested).
- Avoids forbidden letters (R, A, N).

This guess will help narrow down **E**'s position and test three new letters.

We can try a word like ""CEILS"" but that is not a word.

Also, we don\'t know if L is in the word. But we can try.\n\n However, we want to maximize new letters. Also, note that we have only 5 positions and we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Another idea: since we know E is in the word (but not at position 5) and we know the first letter is C, we can try to put E in position 3 or 4 and use new letters for the other positions.\n\n Let\'s list some words that start with C and have an E, and avoid R, A, N.\n\n Some possibilities:\n - C with E in position 2: ""CE"" + three letters (not R, A, N). Examples: ""CEDED"" (but D is new, and we have E again? but we don\'t know if D is in the word). However, we are allowed to reuse E? But note: the feedback for E was a minus, meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. It doesn\'t say anything about having multiple E\'s. So we can have multiple E\'s? But we don\'t know. However, the feedback only marked one E as present (but wrong position). So if we use two E\'s, we might get more information.\n\n But we must avoid R, A, N. So for ""CEDED"": C E D E D -> but we have two E\'s and two D\'s. It\'s a valid word. However, we are not sure if the secret word has two E\'s and two D\'s.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position and uses common consonants.\n\n Another common word: ""CHEST"" -> but we have E in position 2? Actually, ""CHEST"" is C H E S T. So E is in position 3. Also, we avoid R, A, N? H, E, S, T: no R, A, N. But note: we have E in position 3. Also, we can test H, S, T.\n\n However, we must consider that the feedback for E was a minus meaning it is present but not at position 5. So in ""CHEST"", E is at position 3, which is allowed.\n\n But wait: the feedback for the first guess ""crane"" had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has an E, but not at position 5. It doesn\'t say anything about having E at position 3. So that\'s allowed.\n\n However, we also know that the secret word does not have R, A, N. So ""CHEST"" is acceptable.\n\n But let me check: the word must be 5 letters and valid.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put E in position 4? For example: ""CLOTE"" (but is that a word? not really). Or ""CUPTE"" (not a word).\n\n How about ""CHEWY""? But that has E at position 3? Actually, ""CHEWY"" is C H E W Y -> E at position 3.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""CELLO"": C E L L O -> E at position 2.\n\n But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to get as much information as possible.\n\n Since we know the first letter is C and we know E is present (but not at position 5), we can try to use a word that has E in a new position and tests other common letters.\n\n Let me think of a word that starts with C, has E in position 3 or 4, and uses new letters.\n\n Another idea: ""CABLE"" -> but we have A? We know A is not in the word (from the first feedback: A was marked as absent). So we cannot use A.\n\n We must avoid A, R, N.\n\n So ""CABLE"" is invalid because it has A.\n\n How about ""CEDED""? As I thought earlier: C E D E D -> but that has two E\'s and two D\'s. It\'s a valid word. But we are using E in position 2 and 4? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, we are using D.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""CHILE"": C H I L E -> but E is at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5 (from the first feedback: E was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position, meaning it is in the word but not at position 5). So we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting E at position 5.\n\n Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting E at position 5.\n\n So ""CHILE"" has E at position 5 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""CHEST"": C H E S T -> E at position 3. This is acceptable.\n\n Another option: ""CUBES"": C U B E S -> E at position 4. This is also acceptable.\n\n But note: we have to avoid R, A, N. Both ""CHEST"" and ""CUBES"" avoid these.\n\n Let me choose ""CHEST"" because it has common letters: H, E, S, T. And we can test H, S, T.\n\n So the next guess: ""CHEST""\n\n However, note: we are not sure if the word has H, S, T. We are testing them.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that has E in position 2, such as ""CELLO"". But ""CELLO"" uses L and O, which are new.\n\n But we have two good candidates: ""CHEST"" and ""CELLO"".\n\n Which one gives more information? \n - ""CHEST"": tests H, E, S, T (with E at position 3).\n - ""CELLO"": tests E, L, L, O (with E at position 2).\n\n Then we can compare:\n\n We know the word has E, so we are testing 4 new letters in ""CHEST"" (H, S, T) and 4 new letters in ""CELLO"" (L, O, and one L and one O). Actually, ""CELLO"" has two L\'s and two O\'s? Wait: ""CELLO"" is C E L L O -> two L\'s and one O.\n\n We want to maximize the number of new distinct letters? Because we don\'t know anything about the other four letters.\n\n I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice because it tests four distinct new letters: H, E, S, T.\n\n But note: we are reusing E, but that\'s okay because we are trying to find its position.\n\n However, we are avoiding R, A, N.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""CHEST"".\n\n But wait: what if the word has E at position 2? Then by putting E at position 3 (as in ""CHEST"") we might get a minus again? But we are testing other positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put E in a position we haven\'t tried (position 2) to see if it\'s there.\n\n Since we know E is present but not at position 5, we can try position 2.\n\n So let me consider ""CELLO"": \n   C E L L O -> positions: C(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), O(5)\n\n But note: we know the first letter is C, so we are testing E at position 2. Also, we are testing L and O.\n\n However, we are using two L\'s. If the word has only one L, then we might get confusing feedback? But we\'ll see.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""CEILT"" (but that\'s not a common word) or ""CELEB"" (not valid).\n\n Another common word: ""CEMENT"" -> but that has E at position 2 and 4? And we avoid R, A, N? M, E, N, T: but we have N? We know N is not in the word! So we cannot use N.\n\n So ""CEMENT"" is invalid because of N.\n\n How about ""CELTS"": C E L T S -> E at position 2, and tests L, T, S.\n\n That\'s a valid word.\n\n But we have two options: ""CHEST"", ""CELTS"", ""CELLO"", etc.\n\n I think ""CELTS"" is a good choice because it tests three new letters (L, T, S) and we avoid the forbidden letters.\n\n However, we are putting E at position 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put E in position 4? For example: ""CUPHE"" (not common) or ""CABLE"" (has A, invalid) -> ""CABLE"" is invalid because of A.\n\n Another word: ""CURED"" -> but has R? We know R is not in the word -> invalid.\n\n How about ""CUBES"": C U B E S -> E at position 4. This tests U, B, E, S.\n\n But we have E at position 4? We don\'t know if that\'s the correct position, but we are testing.\n\n We have to choose one.\n\n Let me think about the frequency of letters. We want to test common letters.\n\n S, T, L are very common. So ""CHEST"" or ""CELTS"" or ""CELLO"".\n\n I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice because it tests S and T as well.\n\n But note: we have already eliminated A, R, N. So we are left with many letters.\n\n I\'ll go with ""CHEST"".\n\n However, wait: the word must be 5 letters and we are avoiding R, A, N. So ""CHEST"" is acceptable.\n\n So the next guess: ""CHEST""\n\n But note: we are putting E at position 3. We know E is in the word but not at position 5. Position 3 is a new position.\n\n However, we must be cautious: if the word has two E\'s, we might get multiple minuses? But we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t reuse E? But we know E is in the word, so we should use E to test its position.\n\n But we are allowed to reuse E? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient? However, we are testing the position of E.\n\n So I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice.\n\n However, let me check if there is a word that uses E in a different position and also tests other common letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""CLOSE"" -> but that has O and S, and E at the end? We cannot put E at the end.\n\n How about ""CLOUD"": but that doesn\'t have E? We must include E because we know it\'s in the word? Actually, we don\'t have to include E? But if we don\'t include E, we won\'t get information about E\'s position. So we should include E.\n\n We know E is present, so we must include E in the guess? Actually, no. We can guess without E? But then we wouldn\'t get information about E\'s position. So it\'s better to include E.\n\n So I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice.\n\n Let me write it: C H E S T\n\n But wait: what if the word has E in position 2? Then we get a check for E? But we are putting E in position 3? Actually, in ""CHEST"", E is in position 3.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 2: ""CELTS"" (C E L T S) or ""CEILS"" (C E I L S). But ""CEILS"" is not a common word? Actually, ""CEILS"" is not valid. ""CELEB"" is not valid.\n\n Another word: ""CESTI"" (not common) or ""CESTI"" is not valid.\n\n How about ""CETYL"" (C E T Y L) -> but that\'s not very common.\n\n I think ""CELTS"" is a good alternative: it tests E at position 2 and L, T, S.\n\n But we have two good candidates: ""CHEST"" and ""CELTS"".\n\n I\'ll choose ""CELTS"" because it tests E in a new position (position 2) and we get to test L, T, S.\n\n So the next guess: ""CELTS""\n\n But note: we are putting E at position 2. We know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s at position 2. If we get a check for E, then we know it\'s at position 2. If we get a minus, then E is in the word but not at position 2 (so it must be at 3 or 4). If we get an x, that would be a contradiction because we know E is in the word? But we shouldn\'t get an x.\n\n Actually, we know E is in the word, so we expect either a check (if it\'s at position 2) or a minus (if it\'s in the word but not at 2). But note: we have two E\'s in ""CELTS""? No, only one E.\n\n ""CELTS"": C E L T S -> one E.\n\n So we are testing E at position 2 and the letters L, T, S.\n\n This seems good.\n\n But wait: what if the word has E at position 4? Then in ""CELTS"", the E at position 2 would be a minus? And we would know that E is not at position 2, so it must be at 3 or 4? But we are testing position 2 first.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 4? For example: ""CUPHE"" is not common. ""CABLE"" is invalid. ""CEDED"" is valid: C E D E D -> but we have E at position 2 and 4? Actually, position 2 is E and position 4 is E? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s.\n\n I think ""CELTS"" is a solid choice.\n\n But note: we are testing 4 new letters. That\'s good.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""CELTS"".\n\n However, let me check: we have the following constraints:\n - Position 1: C (fixed)\n - The word must contain E (but not at position 5) and we are putting E at position 2.\n - We are avoiding R, A, N.\n\n So ""CELTS"" is acceptable.\n\n Therefore, the next guess is ""CELTS"".\n\n But wait: what if the word has E at position 4? Then we are not testing position 4? But we will get feedback on E: if we get a minus for E, then we know E is not at position 2, so it must be at 3 or 4. And if we get a check for E, then we know it\'s at position 2.\n\n So we are learning about E\'s position.\n\n Similarly, we are testing L, T, S.\n\n So let\'s go with ""CELTS"".\n\n<guess>celts</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).\n- **R**, **A**, and **N** are absent (x).\n- **E** is present but not in position 5 (-).\n\nKey deductions:\n1.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

Guess 2: ""celts""
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- E: - (in word, wrong position) — note: this is the second time we see E is present but not at position 2.
- L: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)
- S: ✓ (correct position)

So from both guesses, we know:

1. The word starts with C and has S at the end. So the pattern is: C _ _ _ S
2. The word contains E, but not at position 2 (from guess 2) and not at position 5 (from guess 1). Therefore, E must be in position 3 or 4.
3. The word does not contain: R, A, N, L, T.

We also have the following letters tested and absent: R, A, N, L, T.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Starts with C and ends with S (so positions 1 and 5 are fixed: C and S).
- Has E in position 3 or 4 (since it can't be in 1,2,5).
- Avoids the letters: R, A, N, L, T.

We must also test the middle letters. We know position 3 and 4 are candidates for E, and position 2 and 3 (but position 3 is also a candidate for E) — actually, position 2 is still unknown, and position 3 and 4 are unknown.

But note: we have two positions fixed: C at 1 and S at 5. So the word is: C _ _ _ S

We know E is in the word and must be in position 3 or 4.

We need to choose a word that fits: C _ _ _ S, with E in either position 3 or 4, and without R, A, N, L, T.

Also, we must use only valid English words.

Let's think of possible words:

First, if E is in position 3: then the word is C _ E _ S. The second and fourth positions are unknown (but cannot be R, A, N, L, T, and also we know from guess1 and guess2 that R, A, N, L, T are absent).

So for C _ E _ S:
- The second letter can be: any letter except R, A, N, L, T (and also not C, E, S because we are using them? But C and S are fixed at positions 1 and 5, but they can appear again? The feedback doesn't say anything about multiple occurrences, so we can't rule out duplicates. However, we haven't seen any duplicates so far.

But we must avoid the absent letters.

Possible letters for the second position: any letter except R, A, N, L, T. Also, we haven't tested many vowels: O, U, I? Or consonants: B, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

But we need to form a valid word.

Examples: 
- ""CHESS"" — but that has two S's? And S is at the end? Our pattern is C _ E _ S, so the fourth position must be the last but one? So ""CHESS"" would be C H E S S -> but then the S at position 4 and 5? But we have S at position 5, so if we put S at position 4, that would be a problem? Actually, we don't know if S can be at position 4. The feedback for S in guess2 was a check at position 5, but we don't have information about position 4.

But wait: in guess2, we had ""celts"": C E L T S -> L and T were absent, and S was correct at position 5. So S is only at position 5? Or could it be elsewhere? The feedback doesn't say anything about S being elsewhere. But we don't have evidence of multiple S's.

However, we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication so far.

But let's check the pattern: we have C _ E _ S. The second letter is unknown, and the fourth letter is unknown.

Possible words: 
- ""CHESS"": C H E S S -> but then the fourth letter is S? And the fifth is S? That would be two S's. But we don't know if the word has two S's. Also, H is new.

But note: in guess2, we had S at position 5 and it was correct. If the word had an S at position 4, then in guess2 we would have had a minus for the S at position 5? Actually, no: because the feedback only marks the S at position 5 as correct. If there were an S at position 4, we wouldn't know because we didn't test position 4. But in the feedback for guess2, we only got one S marked (at position 5). So if the word had two S's, then when we guessed ""celts"", we only tested one S (at position 5) and got it correct. The other S (if at position 4) would not be reflected because we didn't guess an S at position 4. So it's possible.

But we must form a valid word.

However, ""CHESS"" is not a common word? Actually, ""chess"" is a word (meaning a type of board or a game). But let's see if there are more common words.

Other possibilities for C _ E _ S:
- ""CHEFS"" — but that would be C H E F S. F is new. This is a valid word (as in ""chefs"").
- ""CHEPS"" — C H E P S. Valid.
- ""CHESS"" — as above.

But what about if E is in position 4? Then the word is C _ _ E S. The third letter is unknown.

So for C _ _ E S:
- ""CUPES"" — not a common word? Actually, ""cupes"" is not standard.
- ""COPES"" — C O P E S -> valid? ""COPES"" is a word (meaning: a type of tree or to cover with cups).
- ""CIDES"" — not common.
- ""CAVES"" — but A is absent.

Alternatively, ""CUSES"" — but that would be C U S E S -> but then E is at position 4? And S at position 3 and 5? But we have S at position 5 fixed, so if we put S at position 3, that would be a duplicate? And position 4 is E? So ""CUSES"" is C U S E S -> positions: C(1), U(2), S(3), E(4), S(5). But we have S at position 5, and if we put S at position 3, that would be a duplicate S? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But we must avoid A, R, N, L, T.

""CUSES"" has U and S, E. But we have two S's? And S at position 3 and 5. But we are testing position 3 and 4 for E? Actually, in this word, E is at position 4.

But we don't know if E is at position 4 or 3. We only know it's not at 1,2,5.

So let's list possible words:

Option 1: E at position 3: C _ E _ S
- Possible: 
  - ""CHESS"" (H at 2, F at 4)
  - ""CHEPS"" (H at 2, P at 4)
  - ""CHEFS"" (H at 2, F at 4)
  - ""CHEWY"" — but that ends with Y, not S? No, we need to end with S.

Option 2: E at position 4: C _ _ E S
- ""COPES"" (O at 2, P at 3, E at 4, S at 5) -> valid.
- ""CIDES"" — not common.
- ""CUSES"" (U at 2, S at 3, E at 4, S at 5) -> but that has two S's. Is that allowed? Yes, but we don't know if the word has two S's.

But we must avoid the absent letters. ""CUSES"" has U and S, E. S is already known to be in the word (at position 5), but if we put S at position 3, that's a duplicate. We don't know if duplicates are present.

Alternatively, ""COPES"" is a valid word and uses O and P.

But we also have to consider that we are testing position 4 for E? In ""COPES"", E is at position 4.

But we don't know if E is at position 4 or 3. We have to choose a word that will help us distinguish.

We can also consider that we have two positions fixed: 1 and 5, and we know E is in 3 or 4. So we can try to test both possibilities? But we can only test one at a time.

We can choose a word that has E in position 3 and a new letter in position 4? Or vice versa.

But we also want to test other common letters.

We have many letters left to test: for example, we haven't tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

But we are constrained by the pattern: we have to put E in position 3 or 4, and the other two positions must be filled with letters not in the absent list.

Let me try to form a word that tests E in position 3 and introduces two new letters for positions 2 and 4? Or vice versa.

We can try ""CHESS"": 
  - C H E S S -> but then we are putting E at position 3, and S at position 4 and 5? But position 5 is fixed as S, so if we put S at position 4, that's a duplicate. And H is new at position 2.

But we are testing H and F? Actually, ""CHESS"" tests H and F.

But we have two S's? And we are testing S at position 4? We don't know if S is duplicated.

Alternatively, we can try ""CHEFS"": C H E F S -> tests H and F, and E at position 3.

But we are avoiding R, A, N, L, T. So ""CHEFS"" is acceptable? But is ""CHEFS"" a word? It might be informal? Actually, ""chefs"" is not a standard word. The correct word might be ""CHEFS""? But let me think.

Actually, ""CHESS"" is a valid word (as in the game of chess). But it has two S's.

Another word: ""CHEPS"" (meaning: to make something happen) — C H E P S. This tests H and P.

But we have E at position 3.

We can also consider ""CHEWY"" — but that ends with Y, not S.

How about ""CHEVY""? No.

So for E at position 3: we have ""CHESS"", ""CHEPS"", ""CHEFS"", ""CHEW"" (but that's 4 letters, not 5). 5-letter words: ""CHEWY"" doesn't end with S.

""CHIPS"" — but that ends with S? C H I P S -> but then E is not in the word? But we know E is in the word, so we must include E? Actually, we don't have to include E? But if we don't include E, we won't get information about its position. So we should include E.

So we must have E in the word.

Therefore, for the pattern C _ _ _ S, with E in position 3: we have:

- ""CHESS"": tests H and F (and duplicate S? but we don't know if duplicate is allowed)
- ""CHEPS"": tests H and P
- ""CHEFS"": tests H and F (again, duplicate S? but F is new)
- ""CHEWY"": doesn't end with S.

Or ""CUSES"": but that has two S's: C U S E S -> tests U and duplicate S.

But we don't know if duplicates are present. So we can try ""CHESS"" to test H and F, and also the duplicate S? But we are testing position 3 for E and position 4 for S? Actually, in ""CHESS"": 
  Position 1: C (fixed)
  Position 2: H (new)
  Position 3: E (we are testing if E is here)
  Position 4: S (we are testing if S is at position 4? But we already know S is at position 5, so if we get a minus for S at position 4, that would be new information? But we are also testing E at position 3.

But we are using two S's. If the word has only one S, then we might get an x for the S at position 4? But we already know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 4 and it's not present, we get x. But if it is present, we get a minus? But we don't know if there is a duplicate.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicate letters to test more new letters.

For example, ""CHEPS"": C H E P S -> no duplicate, and tests H and P.

Similarly, ""CHEFS"": C H E F S -> tests H and F.

But ""CHEFS"" is not a common word? Actually, it might be considered informal? But let's see.

Another word: ""CHEVY"" — no.

""CHIPS"": C H I P S -> but E is not in the word? So we wouldn't test E. But we know E is in the word, so we must include E. Therefore, we cannot use ""CHIPS"" because it doesn't have E.

We must have E in the word.

So for the pattern with E at position 4: C _ _ E S
- ""COPES"": C O P E S -> tests O and P.
- ""CIDES"": not common.
- ""CUSES"": C U S E S -> tests U and duplicate S.

But ""CUSES"" has duplicate S, and we are testing S at position 3 and 5? But we already know position 5 is S, so if we put S at position 3, we might get:
- If the word has S at position 3, we get a check? But we don't know.
- If the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get a minus for S at position 3? And we also get an x for the S at position 4? Actually, we are testing two S's: one at position 3 and one at position 4. If the word has only one S (at position 5), then:
  - Position 3: S -> we guess S, but the word has only one S, so we get a minus (because S is in the word but not at position 3). And position 4: S -> we have an S at position 4? But the word has only one S, so the S at position 4 would be an extra? Actually, no: if the word has only one S, then the S at position 3 (if present) would be a minus, and the S at position 4 would be x? Because the S is already accounted for at position 5? Actually, no: the feedback marks each letter individually. If the word has one S, and we guess two S's, then:
  - The S at position 3: since the word has only one S and it's at position 5, we mark the S at position 3 as absent? Actually, no: the feedback marks based on the actual occurrences. Since the word has one S, and we have two S's in the guess, then:
    - The S at position 3: because the word has only one S and it's at position 5, this S is not in the word? Actually, no: the word has one S, so the S at position 3 is not in the word? But wait, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, we get a minus. If it's not in the word at all, we get x. But we know the word has at least one S (at position 5). So if we put an extra S, it might be marked as present but wrong position? Or if the word has two S's, then it might be marked as present? But we don't know.

This is getting complicated. To avoid confusion, maybe we should avoid using duplicate letters for now? Because we don't know if duplicates are present.

So let's try to avoid duplicates.

Therefore, for the pattern with E at position 4: C _ _ E S, we can try:

- ""COPES"": C O P E S -> tests O and P.
- ""CIVES"": not common.
- ""CIDES"": not common.

Or without duplicates: ""COPES"" is acceptable.

For the pattern with E at position 3: C _ E _ S, we can try:

- ""CHEPS"": C H E P S -> tests H and P.
- ""CHEFS"": C H E F S -> tests H and F.
- ""CHEWY"": doesn't end with S.

But ""CHEWY"" is C H E W Y -> not ending with S.

How about ""CHEVY""? No.

""CHIPS"" doesn't have E.

So we need a word that has E and ends with S, and has two new letters.

List of possible words that fit the pattern and avoid forbidden letters:

Pattern: C _ _ _ S, with E in position 3 or 4, and without R, A, N, L, T.

E at position 3:
- ""CHESS"" (H, F) — but duplicate S? Actually, no duplicate: ""CHESS"" has one S? Wait, ""CHESS"" is C-H-E-S-S? That's two S's? Oh, it has two S's: positions 3 and 4 are S and S? Actually: 
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: H
  Position 3: E
  Position 4: S
  Position 5: S

So it has two S's. But we are testing E at position 3 and S at position 4? But we already know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 4, we might get:
  - If the word has S at position 4, we get a check? But we don't know.
  - If the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get a minus for position 4 S? Because the S is already accounted for at position 5? Actually, the feedback marks each letter individually. So if the word has only one S, then the S at position 4 would be marked as absent? But we already have a S at position 5, so the S at position 4 would be an extra? And if the word has only one S, then the S at position 4 would be x? Because the S is already used at position 5? Actually, no: the feedback doesn't consider duplicates? 

Wait, the rules: each letter is marked independently. But if the word has only one S, and we guess two S's, then:
  - The S at position 5: correct (check)
  - The S at position 4: since the word has only one S and it's already used at position 5, the S at position 4 would be marked as absent? Actually, no: the feedback should mark it as absent because the S is not in the word? But we know the word has an S at position 5, so the S at position 4 would be an extra? And if the word has only one S, then the S at position 4 would be x? Because the S is already accounted for by the position 5 S? Actually, the feedback doesn't mark the S at position 4 as present? Because the S is already used? 

But the rules: each letter is marked based on the actual occurrences. So if the word has one S, and we guess two S's, then:
  - The S at position 5: correct (check)
  - The S at position 4: since the word has only one S and it's already used at position 5, the S at position 4 would be marked as absent (x)? Because the S is not in the word? But wait, the word has one S, so the S at position 4 is not present? So we get x for that S.

But we are testing E at position 3? So we can get:
  - If E is at position 3, we get a check? But we don't know if E is at position 3 or 4.
  - If we get a minus for E, then E is not at position 3, so it must be at position 4.

But we are also testing H and the fourth letter S? But we are testing S at position 4? And if we get x for the S at position 4, then the word has only one S (at position 5) and E must be at position 4? Because we are testing E at position 3 and getting a minus? Then E must be at position 4? Because we know it's not at 1,2,5.

But wait, if we get a minus for E at position 3, then E is in the word but not at 3, so it must be at 4? But we are not sure if E is at 4? We are testing position 3.

Alternatively, we can try to test E at position 4 without testing duplicate S? 

How about ""COPES"": C O P E S -> tests O and P, and E at position 4.

This avoids duplicates and tests two new letters.

Similarly, ""CUSES"": tests U and duplicate S? But duplicate S: we are testing S at position 3 and 4? And we already know S is at position 5.

But to avoid complexity, let's try ""COPES"".

But wait: what if the word has E at position 3? Then ""COPES"" would not test position 3? Actually, we are testing E at position 4? 

In ""COPES"": 
  Position 1: C (fixed)
  Position 2: O (new)
  Position 3: P (new)
  Position 4: E (we are testing if E is at position 4)
  Position 5: S (fixed)

If we get:
  - If E is at position 4, we get a check? Or if it's at position 3, we get a minus? And then we know E is at position 3? But we are testing position 4.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E at position 3 and tests two new letters? For example: ""CHEPS"" (C H E P S) -> tests H and P.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider: we have not tested position 2 and 3 (except that position 3 is not E? from guess1 we know position 3 is not E? Actually, guess1: E was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position, so position 3 is still possible? And we haven't tested position 3 for E? We tested position 2 and 5? Only position 5 for E? Actually, we tested position 2 and 5? And position 3 and 4 are untested.

But in guess1, we had E at position 5 and got a minus? So E is in the word but not at 5. We haven't tested position 3 and 4 for E? So we can test E at position 3 in this guess.

So let's try to test E at position 3? Then we can see if it's correct.

But we are also testing other letters.

We have two fixed letters: C and S. And we know E is in the word.

So we can try:

Word: ""CHESS"" — but duplicate S? And we are testing S at position 4? And E at position 3.

But let me see: if the word has E at position 3, then we get a check for E? And if we get a minus for E, then E is not at position 3, so it must be at position 4.

Also, we test H and the fourth letter S? But if the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get x for the S at position 4? And then we know the fourth letter is not S? And E must be at position 4? Because we have E present and not at 3? And we haven't tested position 4 for E? Actually, we haven't tested position 4 at all? Only position 5 (in guess1) and position 2 (in guess2) were tested? For E, we tested position 5 (guess1) and position 2 (guess2) and got minuses? So position 3 and 4 are untested for E.

So if we test E at position 3 (as in ""CHESS"") and we get a minus, then E is not at position 3, so it must be at position 4? And if we get a check, then E is at position 3.

But we are also testing the letter at position 4? In ""CHESS"", position 4 is S? But we are testing S at position 4? And if the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get x for the S at position 4? And then we know the fourth letter is not S? And E must be at position 4? Because we have E present and not at 3? But wait, if we get a minus for E at position 3, then E is not at position 3, so it must be at position 4? Because we know E is in the word and not at 1,2,5. So position 4 is the only possibility? But we are testing position 3 for E? And if we get a minus, then E is at position 4.

But we are also testing S at position 4? And if we get x for the S at position 4, then the word has only one S (at position 5). Then E must be at position 4? Because we have E present and not at 3? And we haven't tested position 4 for E? Actually, we haven't tested position 4? Only position 5 (guess1) and position 2 (guess2) were tested? So position 4 is unknown.

So if we guess ""CHESS"":
  - If E is at position 3, we get a check for E? And if we get a minus for E, then E is not at position 3, so it must be at position 4? And then we know the fourth letter is S? But we are testing S at position 4? And if we get a minus for S at position 4, that would mean the word has only one S (at position 5) and E is at position 4? Then the word is C _ _ E S? But we have the fifth letter as S? So it would be C _ _ E S? But we have the fourth letter E? And fifth S? So the word is C ? ? E S.

But we don't know the second and third letters.

But we are testing H at position 2 and S at position 4? And if we get a minus for S at position 4, then the word has only one S (at position 5) and E at position 4? Then the word is C ? ? E S.

But we don't know the second and third letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have duplicate S? 

How about ""CHEPS"": C H E P S -> no duplicate. This tests H at position 2 and P at position 4.

If we get:
  - If E is at position 3, we get a check? And if we get a minus for E, then E is not at position 3, so it must be at position 4? And then we know the fourth letter is not P? And we have the fifth as S? So the word is C ? ? E S? And we know the second letter is not H? And the third letter is not E? But we already know E is not at position 3? Because in guess1, E was at position 5 and got a minus? Meaning the E is present but not at 5? It doesn't say anything about position 3? So position 3 could have E? Actually, no: in guess1, we tested E at position 5 and got a minus? That means E is in the word but not at position 5? It doesn't tell us about position 3? We haven't tested position 3 for E? We tested position 2 and 5? So position 3 is unknown.

So if we guess ""CHEPS"":
  - If E is at position 3, we get a check? Then we know E is at 3? And then we only need to find the second and third letters? But we don't know the third? And the fourth? But we are testing P at position 4? And H at position 2? And if we get checks for H and P? Then we have the word? But we don't know if E is at position 3? We are testing it.

But if E is not at position 3, then we get a minus for E? And then we know E must be at position 4? And then the word is C ? ? E S? And we have H at position 2? And P at position 4? But we don't know if H and P are in the word? 

But we are testing two new letters: H and P.

Alternatively, we can try ""CHEFS"": but that might not be common.

Another word: ""CHEVY"" — no.

How about ""CHEWY""? No.

""CHIPS"" doesn't have E.

So let's consider ""CHEPS"" or ""CHESS"". But ""CHESS"" has duplicate S? And we are testing S at position 4? Which might be a duplicate? 

But we can try ""CHEPS"" to avoid duplicate.

But what about ""CHEFS""? It might be accepted? But let's see: ""chefs"" is not standard.

Another word: ""CHEVY"" — no.

""CHINE"" — but has N? N is absent? So invalid.

""CHIVES"" — not common.

""CHOPS"" — but ends with S? C H O P S -> but then E is not in the word? But we know E is in the word, so we must include E? So we cannot use ""CHOPS"".

We must have E.

So how about ""CHEAP"" — but has A? A is absent.

""CHEEK"" — has E at position 3? And K? But ends with K? Not S.

We need to end with S.

So words ending with S and having E at position 3: 
  - ""CHESS"" (if we allow duplicate S? But we don't know if the word has two S's)
  - ""CHEPS"" (no duplicate)
  - ""CHEFS"" (no duplicate, but ""chefs"" is not common)
  - ""CHEWY"" (no S at the end)

Or words with E at position 4: 
  - ""COPES"" (no duplicate)
  - ""CUSES"" (duplicate S)
  - ""CIVES"" (not common)
  - ""CIDES"" (not common)

So ""COPES"" is a valid and common word? Actually, ""copes"" is a word (meaning: a type of tree or to cover with cups).

But we haven't tested O and P.

Alternatively, we can try ""CUSES"": but that has duplicate S? And we are testing S at position 3? And position 4 is E? So ""CUSES"": C U S E S -> tests U and duplicate S? And we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 3, we might get:
  - If the word has S at position 3, we get a check? But we don't know.
  - If the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get a minus for S at position 3? And then we know the word has only one S? And E must be at position 4? Then the word is C ? ? E S? And we have U at position 2? And the third letter is unknown? But we get feedback on U? And the third letter? 

But we are testing U and the third letter? But we don't know if U is in the word.

But we are testing two new letters? And we are testing the position of E.

But we have to choose one.

Given that we have only 4 guesses left, we want to maximize information.

We know the word is C _ _ _ S, and E is in position 3 or 4.

We can try to test both possibilities? But we can only test one at a time.

We can choose a word that has E in position 3 and tests two new letters? Or in position 4?

But we don't know which one? So we have to pick one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have E? But we know E is in the word, so we should include E to get more information about its position? But we already know E is present? And we are testing position 3? Or 4?

But we have two positions: 2 and 3 (if E is at 3) or 2 and 4 (if E is at 4). But we don't know which one.

So we can try a word that has E at position 3 and tests two new letters? Then we can see if E is at position 3? If we get a check for E, then we know E is at 3? And if we get a minus, then E must be at position 4? Because we know it's not at 1,2,5? And we haven't tested position 4? But we are testing position 3.

But we are also testing the fourth letter? In ""CHEPS"", we are testing P at position 4? And E at position 3.

Similarly, if we choose ""COPES"", we are testing E at position 4? And P at position 3? And O at position 2.

Which one to choose?

We can also consider that we have not tested many vowels: O, U, I? So testing O or U might be good.

But we have to pick one.

Let me list the possibilities:

Case 1: E at position 3 -> word: C H E ? S (where ? is a letter not in {R, A, N, L, T, and not C, E, S? But C and S are fixed, so the second letter can be any new letter, and the fourth letter can be any new letter? But we must avoid R, A, N, L, T.

So for E at position 3: 
  - The fourth letter must be a letter not in the absent list? And not S? Because we are testing position 3 for E? And we are testing the fourth letter? 

Possible words: 
  - ""CHESS"" (H, F) -> but duplicate S? And F is new? And we are testing S at position 4? But we already know S is at position 5? So if we get a minus for S at position 4, then the word has only one S? And E must be at position 4? Then the word is C ? ? E S? And we have H at position 2? And the third letter is unknown? And F at position 4? Actually, ""CHESS"" is C H E S S -> so position 4 is S? And position 5 is S? So if we get a minus for the S at position 4? That would mean the word has only one S (at position 5) and E is at position 4? Then the word is C ? ? E S? And we have H at position 2? And the third letter is unknown? And we are testing F at position 3? 

But ""CHESS"" is valid.

But we are using duplicate S? And we don't know if duplicate S is present.

Another word: ""CHEFS"" (C H E F S) -> tests H and F, and E at position 3.

Similarly, ""CHEPS"" (C H E P S) -> tests H and P.

But we don't know if H is in the word? We haven't tested H? So we can test H? And P? 

We can also try a word that doesn't have H? For example, ""CHEFS"" or ""CHEPS"".

But let me see: we have to avoid L, T, R, A, N. So H is allowed.

But we have to consider: if we test E at position 3 and we get a check, then we know E is at 3? And then we only need to find the second and third letters? But we don't know the third? And the fourth? But we are testing F? Or P? Or H? 

But if we get a minus for E at position 3, then E is not at 3? So it must be at 4? And then the word is C ? ? E S? And we have the second letter unknown? And the third letter unknown? And we have the fourth letter E? And fifth S.

Then we can try to find words of the form C ? ? E S? With the second and third letters not in {R, A, N, L, T} and not C, E, S? But C and S are fixed? So the second and third letters can be any new letter? But we must avoid R, A, N, L, T.

So possible words: 
  - ""CHEPS"" (H, P)
  - ""CHEFS"" (H, F)
  - ""CHEWY"" — no, because doesn't end with S.
  - ""CHEVY"" — no.
  - ""CHESS"" (H, F) — but that has duplicate S? And we are testing S at position 4? And we get a minus for S at position 4? Then we know the word has only one S (at position 5) and E at position 4? Then the word is C ? ? E S? And we have H at position 2? And the third letter is unknown? And we have F at position 3? So ""CHESS"" would be the word? But we are guessing it? And if it's correct, we win? But if not, we get feedback.

But we are limited to 4 guesses? We are on guess 3.

But we have to make a guess.

Another idea: we can try a word that doesn't have E? But we know E is in the word, so we should include E? Because we are trying to find its position? And we have two positions left? But we are testing position 3? Or 4? 

We can also try to test position 4 for E? Without testing position 3? 

For example, we can try ""COPES"": C O P E S -> tests O at position 2, P at position 3, and E at position 4.

If E is at position 4, we get a check for E? And if we get a minus for E, then E is not at position 4? So it must be at position 3? And then the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O at position 2? And P at position 3? And the fourth letter is unknown? 

But we are testing O and P? And we get information about O and P.

Similarly, we can try ""COPES"" to test E at position 4? And we get:
  - If E is at position 4, we get a check? Then we know E is at 4? And then we only need to find the second and third letters? But we don't know the third? And the fourth is E? Fifth is S? So the word is C ? ? E S? And we have O at 2? And P at 3? And the third letter is unknown? 

But if we get a minus for E at position 4? Then E is not at 4? So it must be at 3? And then the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O at 2? And P at 3? And the fourth letter is unknown? 

But we are testing O and P? And we get feedback on their presence.

But we have two good candidates: ""CHESS"" (with duplicate S) and ""CHEPS"" (with duplicate? No: ""CHEPS"" has H, E, P, S? No duplicate? ""CHEPS"" is C H E P S -> no duplicate.

""CHEPS"" tests H and P? And E at position 3.

But we are testing the same thing: we are testing position 3 for E? And if we get a minus, then E is at position 4? And we know the fourth letter is not P? And we have H at position 2? But we don't know if H is in the word? 

But we are testing two new letters? And we are testing the position of E.

But we can also try to test multiple new letters? 

Another word: ""CUBES"" — but we have U? And B? But we haven't tested B? But we are avoiding R, A, N, L, T? So ""CUBES"" has U and B? And E at position 4? So that's acceptable? But we are testing U and B? And E at position 4.

But we don't know if U and B are in the word.

We can also try ""COPES"" to test E at position 4? And tests O and P? And we avoid duplicate? 

But let me check: ""COPES"" is C O P E S? No duplicate? And tests O and P? 

But we have to see if we can get more information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 4? And tests two new vowels? Or consonants? 

How about ""COPES"" and ""CHEPS"" are both good? 

But we have to choose one.

Let me see the frequency of letters? We want to test common letters.

We haven't tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Common letters: O, P, H, D, M, etc.

So ""COPES"" tests O and P? And ""CHEPS"" tests H and P? 

But we are testing H in both? And P in both? 

But we can try ""COPES"" to test a vowel? 

But we have two vowels left? We haven't tested O? Or U? 

We can also try ""CUBES"": C U B E S -> tests U and B? And E at position 4.

But we are testing U and B? 

But we have many letters to test? We can test multiple.

But we are constrained by the pattern.

I think ""COPES"" is a good choice because it tests two common letters: O and P? And we avoid duplicates? 

But let me see: if we guess ""COPES"", and the word is ""CHESS"", then we get:
  - C: ✓
  - O: x (if the word is ""CHESS"", which has no O? And no P? But ""CHESS"" has H and F? So O and P are absent? And E: we are testing E at position 4? But in ""CHESS"", E is at position 3? So we get a minus for E? Because E is in the word but not at position 4? And we know E is in the word? So we get a minus? And then we know E is at position 3? And the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O and P absent? Then we know the word must be C ? E ? S? And we have to try another.

But we are using one guess to test two new letters? And if we get minuses, we know E is at position 4? And the word is C ? ? E S? And we have two letters to try? 

But we have 4 guesses left? We are on guess 3? So we can do that.

But we can also try to test E at position 4? And also test other common letters? 

How about ""COPES"" tests O and P? And we get feedback on O and P.

But we can also try ""COPES"" to test E at position 4? And if E is not at position 4, then E must be at position 3? And the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O and P? Then we can try ""CHESS"" next? But that has duplicate S? 

But we are testing O and P? And if we get minuses, we know E is at position 3? And the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O and P absent? Then we can try ""CHEFS"" or ""CHEPS"" next? 

But we have many possibilities? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 4? And tests two new vowels? Or consonants? 

How about ""COPES"" and ""CHEPS"" are both good? 

But let me see the feedback we got: 

In guess2, we had ""celts"": 
  C: ✓ (position 1)
  E: - (position 2) -> so E is not at position 2? And we know E is in the word? So E is at 3 or 4? 

We can try to test E at position 4? And also test O? 

But we have to choose one.

I think ""COPES"" is a good choice because it tests two common letters: O and P? And we avoid duplicates? 

So I'll go with ""COPES"".

But let me confirm: 
  ""COPES"": C O P E S

If the word is ""CHESS"", then:
  - C: ✓
  - O: x (not in word)
  - P: x (not in word)
  - E: - (because E is at position 3, not 4? Because ""CHESS"" has E at position 3? So E is present but not at position 4? So we get a minus? And then we know E is at position 3? And the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O and P absent? Then we know the word must be C ? E ? S? And we have to try ""CHESS"" next? But then we use two guesses? 

But we have 4 guesses left? We are on guess 3? So we can do that.

But we can also try to test multiple letters? 

Another word: ""CUBES"" — but that has U and B? And E at position 4? 

But we don't know if U and B are in the word.

I think ""COPES"" is a good choice.

But wait: what if the word is ""COPES""? Then we get it right? 

Or if E is at position 3, and the word is ""CHESS"", then we get:

  C: ✓
  O: x
  P: x
  E: - (because E is at position 3, not 4)
  S: ✓ (position 5)

Then we know the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O and P absent? Then we try ""CHESS"" next? 

But we are using two guesses? 

But we can also try to test more new letters? 

How about ""CUBES"": C U B E S -> tests U and B? 

But we are testing U and B? 

But we have to choose one.

I think ""COPES"" is a good choice because it tests two common letters.

So I'll go with ""COPES"".

But let me see: we have not tested O, P, H, U, B, etc.

Another candidate: ""COPES"" is fine.

But wait: what if the word is ""COPES""? Then we win.

Or if not, we get feedback.

So the next guess: ""COPES""

But note: we are testing position 4 for E? And we get feedback on O and P.

So let's write it.

But we must avoid L, T, R, A, N? ""COPES"" has O, P, E, S? And avoids R, A, N, L, T? Yes.

So <guess>copes</guess>

But let me double-check: 
  We know: 
    Position 1: C (fixed)
    Position 5: S (fixed)
    E is present, not at 2 or 5, so must be at 3 or 4? 
    We are testing position 4? 
    We are testing O at position 2? And P at position 3? 

If we get:
  - If E is at position 4, we get a check? Then we know E is at 4? And then the word is C O P E S? And we have the third letter? But we don't know? Actually, we are testing position 4 for E? And if we get a check, then E is at 4? Then the word is C O P E S? And we have the third letter? But we don't know? 

But if we get a minus for E, then E is not at position 4? So it must be at position 3? And then the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O and P absent? Then the word must be C ? E ? S? And we have to try ""CHESS"" or ""CHEFS"" next? 

But we have more guesses.

So it's acceptable.

Therefore, I choose ""COPES"".

But let me see if there is a word that tests more common letters? 

How about ""COPES"" uses O and P? O is a vowel? And P is a consonant? 

Another word: ""COVES"" — but that has V? And E at position 4? But ""co ves"" is not a common word? 

""COVES"" is a word? Meaning: to cover with vesicles? But it's uncommon.

""COVES"" is not standard.

""COMES"" — not common.

So ""COPES"" is acceptable.

Therefore, the next guess is ""COPES"".

But note: we are testing position 4 for E? And we get feedback on O and P? 

We can also consider ""CUBES"": C U B E S -> tests U and B? 

But I think ""COPES"" is fine.

So I'll go with that.

But wait: what if the word is ""COPES""? Then we win.

If not, we get feedback.

So <guess>copes</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  
  - C ✓ (position 1 correct)  
  - R x (R not in word)  
  - A x (A not in word)  
  - N x (N not in word)  
  - E - (E in word, not position 5)  

- **Guess 2 (celts)**:  
  - C ✓ (position 1 correct)  
  - E - (E in word, not position 2)  
  - L x (L not in word)  
  - T x (T not in word)  
  - S ✓ (position 5 correct)  

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 1: **C**  
   - Position 5: **S**  
   So the word pattern is: **C _ _ _ S**.  

2. **E constraints**:  
   - E is in the word but not at position 2 (from guess 2) or 5 (from guess 1).  
   - **E must be at position 3 or 4**.  
   - The word cannot contain R, A, N (from guess 1), L, T (from guess 2).  

3. **Absent letters**:  
   - R, A, N, L, T are confirmed absent.  

4. **Etesting**:  
   - We need to test if E is at position 3 or 4.  
   - Testing position 3 for E (as in ""CHESS"" or ""CHEPS"") will clarify:  
     - If E is ✓ at position 3, it's correct.  
     - If E is -, it means E is at position 4 (since it can't be at 1, 2, or 5).  
   - Testing position 4 for E (as in ""COPES"") will reveal:  
     - If E is ✓ at position 4, it's correct.  
     - If E is x, it means E is at position 3.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Test E in position 4** to resolve its location (since position 3 is riskier and we haven't tested position 4 for E).  
- **Introduce new common letters** to maximize information:  
  - Avoid R, A, N, L, T.  
  - Prioritize high-frequency letters: **O, P, H, D, M, U**.  
- **Avoid duplicates** for now? But we don't know if duplicates exist.  

### Chosen Guess: ""COPES""
- **C** (position 1): ✓ (fixed)  
- **O** (position 2): Tests a common vowel.  
- **P** (position 3): Tests a common consonant.  
- **E** (position 4): Tests if E is at position 4 (if not, E must be at position 3).  
- **S** (position 5): ✓ (fixed)  

This guess efficiently tests E's position while probing two new letters (O and P). If E is at position 4, we get immediate confirmation. If not, we know E is at position 3 (and the word becomes `C _ E _ S`). 

<guess>copes</guess>",copes,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

Guess 2: ""celts""
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- E: - (in word, wrong position) — note: this is the second time we see E is present but not at position 2.
- L: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)
- S: ✓ (correct position)

So from both guesses, we know:

1. The word starts with C and has S at the end. So the pattern is: C _ _ _ S
2. The word contains E, but not at position 2 (from guess 2) and not at position 5 (from guess 1). Therefore, E must be in position 3 or 4.
3. The word does not contain: R, A, N, L, T.

We also have the following letters tested and absent: R, A, N, L, T.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Starts with C and ends with S (so positions 1 and 5 are fixed: C and S).
- Has E in position 3 or 4 (since it can't be in 1,2,5).
- Avoids the letters: R, A, N, L, T.

We must also test the middle letters. We know position 3 and 4 are candidates for E, and position 2 and 3 (but position 3 is also a candidate for E) — actually, position 2 is still unknown, and position 3 and 4 are unknown.

But note: we have two positions fixed: C at 1 and S at 5. So the word is: C _ _ _ S

We know E is in the word and must be in position 3 or 4.

We need to choose a word that fits: C _ _ _ S, with E in either position 3 or 4, and without R, A, N, L, T.

Also, we must use only valid English words.

Let's think of possible words:

First, if E is in position 3: then the word is C _ E _ S. The second and fourth positions are unknown (but cannot be R, A, N, L, T, and also we know from guess1 and guess2 that R, A, N, L, T are absent).

So for C _ E _ S:
- The second letter can be: any letter except R, A, N, L, T (and also not C, E, S because we are using them? But C and S are fixed at positions 1 and 5, but they can appear again? The feedback doesn't say anything about multiple occurrences, so we can't rule out duplicates. However, we haven't seen any duplicates so far.

But we must avoid the absent letters.

Possible letters for the second position: any letter except R, A, N, L, T. Also, we haven't tested many vowels: O, U, I? Or consonants: B, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

But we need to form a valid word.

Examples: 
- ""CHESS"" — but that has two S's? And S is at the end? Our pattern is C _ E _ S, so the fourth position must be the last but one? So ""CHESS"" would be C H E S S -> but then the S at position 4 and 5? But we have S at position 5, so if we put S at position 4, that would be a problem? Actually, we don't know if S can be at position 4. The feedback for S in guess2 was a check at position 5, but we don't have information about position 4.

But wait: in guess2, we had ""celts"": C E L T S -> L and T were absent, and S was correct at position 5. So S is only at position 5? Or could it be elsewhere? The feedback doesn't say anything about S being elsewhere. But we don't have evidence of multiple S's.

However, we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication so far.

But let's check the pattern: we have C _ E _ S. The second letter is unknown, and the fourth letter is unknown.

Possible words: 
- ""CHESS"": C H E S S -> but then the fourth letter is S? And the fifth is S? That would be two S's. But we don't know if the word has two S's. Also, H is new.

But note: in guess2, we had S at position 5 and it was correct. If the word had an S at position 4, then in guess2 we would have had a minus for the S at position 5? Actually, no: because the feedback only marks the S at position 5 as correct. If there were an S at position 4, we wouldn't know because we didn't test position 4. But in the feedback for guess2, we only got one S marked (at position 5). So if the word had two S's, then when we guessed ""celts"", we only tested one S (at position 5) and got it correct. The other S (if at position 4) would not be reflected because we didn't guess an S at position 4. So it's possible.

But we must form a valid word.

However, ""CHESS"" is not a common word? Actually, ""chess"" is a word (meaning a type of board or a game). But let's see if there are more common words.

Other possibilities for C _ E _ S:
- ""CHEFS"" — but that would be C H E F S. F is new. This is a valid word (as in ""chefs"").
- ""CHEPS"" — C H E P S. Valid.
- ""CHESS"" — as above.

But what about if E is in position 4? Then the word is C _ _ E S. The third letter is unknown.

So for C _ _ E S:
- ""CUPES"" — not a common word? Actually, ""cupes"" is not standard.
- ""COPES"" — C O P E S -> valid? ""COPES"" is a word (meaning: a type of tree or to cover with cups).
- ""CIDES"" — not common.
- ""CAVES"" — but A is absent.

Alternatively, ""CUSES"" — but that would be C U S E S -> but then E is at position 4? And S at position 3 and 5? But we have S at position 5 fixed, so if we put S at position 3, that would be a duplicate? And position 4 is E? So ""CUSES"" is C U S E S -> positions: C(1), U(2), S(3), E(4), S(5). But we have S at position 5, and if we put S at position 3, that would be a duplicate S? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But we must avoid A, R, N, L, T.

""CUSES"" has U and S, E. But we have two S's? And S at position 3 and 5. But we are testing position 3 and 4 for E? Actually, in this word, E is at position 4.

But we don't know if E is at position 4 or 3. We only know it's not at 1,2,5.

So let's list possible words:

Option 1: E at position 3: C _ E _ S
- Possible: 
  - ""CHESS"" (H at 2, F at 4)
  - ""CHEPS"" (H at 2, P at 4)
  - ""CHEFS"" (H at 2, F at 4)
  - ""CHEWY"" — but that ends with Y, not S? No, we need to end with S.

Option 2: E at position 4: C _ _ E S
- ""COPES"" (O at 2, P at 3, E at 4, S at 5) -> valid.
- ""CIDES"" — not common.
- ""CUSES"" (U at 2, S at 3, E at 4, S at 5) -> but that has two S's. Is that allowed? Yes, but we don't know if the word has two S's.

But we must avoid the absent letters. ""CUSES"" has U and S, E. S is already known to be in the word (at position 5), but if we put S at position 3, that's a duplicate. We don't know if duplicates are present.

Alternatively, ""COPES"" is a valid word and uses O and P.

But we also have to consider that we are testing position 4 for E? In ""COPES"", E is at position 4.

But we don't know if E is at position 4 or 3. We have to choose a word that will help us distinguish.

We can also consider that we have two positions fixed: 1 and 5, and we know E is in 3 or 4. So we can try to test both possibilities? But we can only test one at a time.

We can choose a word that has E in position 3 and a new letter in position 4? Or vice versa.

But we also want to test other common letters.

We have many letters left to test: for example, we haven't tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

But we are constrained by the pattern: we have to put E in position 3 or 4, and the other two positions must be filled with letters not in the absent list.

Let me try to form a word that tests E in position 3 and introduces two new letters for positions 2 and 4? Or vice versa.

We can try ""CHESS"": 
  - C H E S S -> but then we are putting E at position 3, and S at position 4 and 5? But position 5 is fixed as S, so if we put S at position 4, that's a duplicate. And H is new at position 2.

But we are testing H and F? Actually, ""CHESS"" tests H and F.

But we have two S's? And we are testing S at position 4? We don't know if S is duplicated.

Alternatively, we can try ""CHEFS"": C H E F S -> tests H and F, and E at position 3.

But we are avoiding R, A, N, L, T. So ""CHEFS"" is acceptable? But is ""CHEFS"" a word? It might be informal? Actually, ""chefs"" is not a standard word. The correct word might be ""CHEFS""? But let me think.

Actually, ""CHESS"" is a valid word (as in the game of chess). But it has two S's.

Another word: ""CHEPS"" (meaning: to make something happen) — C H E P S. This tests H and P.

But we have E at position 3.

We can also consider ""CHEWY"" — but that ends with Y, not S.

How about ""CHEVY""? No.

So for E at position 3: we have ""CHESS"", ""CHEPS"", ""CHEFS"", ""CHEW"" (but that's 4 letters, not 5). 5-letter words: ""CHEWY"" doesn't end with S.

""CHIPS"" — but that ends with S? C H I P S -> but then E is not in the word? But we know E is in the word, so we must include E? Actually, we don't have to include E? But if we don't include E, we won't get information about its position. So we should include E.

So we must have E in the word.

Therefore, for the pattern C _ _ _ S, with E in position 3: we have:

- ""CHESS"": tests H and F (and duplicate S? but we don't know if duplicate is allowed)
- ""CHEPS"": tests H and P
- ""CHEFS"": tests H and F (again, duplicate S? but F is new)
- ""CHEWY"": doesn't end with S.

Or ""CUSES"": but that has two S's: C U S E S -> tests U and duplicate S.

But we don't know if duplicates are present. So we can try ""CHESS"" to test H and F, and also the duplicate S? But we are testing position 3 for E and position 4 for S? Actually, in ""CHESS"": 
  Position 1: C (fixed)
  Position 2: H (new)
  Position 3: E (we are testing if E is here)
  Position 4: S (we are testing if S is at position 4? But we already know S is at position 5, so if we get a minus for S at position 4, that would be new information? But we are also testing E at position 3.

But we are using two S's. If the word has only one S, then we might get an x for the S at position 4? But we already know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 4 and it's not present, we get x. But if it is present, we get a minus? But we don't know if there is a duplicate.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicate letters to test more new letters.

For example, ""CHEPS"": C H E P S -> no duplicate, and tests H and P.

Similarly, ""CHEFS"": C H E F S -> tests H and F.

But ""CHEFS"" is not a common word? Actually, it might be considered informal? But let's see.

Another word: ""CHEVY"" — no.

""CHIPS"": C H I P S -> but E is not in the word? So we wouldn't test E. But we know E is in the word, so we must include E. Therefore, we cannot use ""CHIPS"" because it doesn't have E.

We must have E in the word.

So for the pattern with E at position 4: C _ _ E S
- ""COPES"": C O P E S -> tests O and P.
- ""CIDES"": not common.
- ""CUSES"": C U S E S -> tests U and duplicate S.

But ""CUSES"" has duplicate S, and we are testing S at position 3 and 5? But we already know position 5 is S, so if we put S at position 3, we might get:
- If the word has S at position 3, we get a check? But we don't know.
- If the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get a minus for S at position 3? And we also get an x for the S at position 4? Actually, we are testing two S's: one at position 3 and one at position 4. If the word has only one S (at position 5), then:
  - Position 3: S -> we guess S, but the word has only one S, so we get a minus (because S is in the word but not at position 3). And position 4: S -> we have an S at position 4? But the word has only one S, so the S at position 4 would be an extra? Actually, no: if the word has only one S, then the S at position 3 (if present) would be a minus, and the S at position 4 would be x? Because the S is already accounted for at position 5? Actually, no: the feedback marks each letter individually. If the word has one S, and we guess two S's, then:
  - The S at position 3: since the word has only one S and it's at position 5, we mark the S at position 3 as absent? Actually, no: the feedback marks based on the actual occurrences. Since the word has one S, and we have two S's in the guess, then:
    - The S at position 3: because the word has only one S and it's at position 5, this S is not in the word? Actually, no: the word has one S, so the S at position 3 is not in the word? But wait, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, we get a minus. If it's not in the word at all, we get x. But we know the word has at least one S (at position 5). So if we put an extra S, it might be marked as present but wrong position? Or if the word has two S's, then it might be marked as present? But we don't know.

This is getting complicated. To avoid confusion, maybe we should avoid using duplicate letters for now? Because we don't know if duplicates are present.

So let's try to avoid duplicates.

Therefore, for the pattern with E at position 4: C _ _ E S, we can try:

- ""COPES"": C O P E S -> tests O and P.
- ""CIVES"": not common.
- ""CIDES"": not common.

Or without duplicates: ""COPES"" is acceptable.

For the pattern with E at position 3: C _ E _ S, we can try:

- ""CHEPS"": C H E P S -> tests H and P.
- ""CHEFS"": C H E F S -> tests H and F.
- ""CHEWY"": doesn't end with S.

But ""CHEWY"" is C H E W Y -> not ending with S.

How about ""CHEVY""? No.

""CHIPS"" doesn't have E.

So we need a word that has E and ends with S, and has two new letters.

List of possible words that fit the pattern and avoid forbidden letters:

Pattern: C _ _ _ S, with E in position 3 or 4, and without R, A, N, L, T.

E at position 3:
- ""CHESS"" (H, F) — but duplicate S? Actually, no duplicate: ""CHESS"" has one S? Wait, ""CHESS"" is C-H-E-S-S? That's two S's? Oh, it has two S's: positions 3 and 4 are S and S? Actually: 
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: H
  Position 3: E
  Position 4: S
  Position 5: S

So it has two S's. But we are testing E at position 3 and S at position 4? But we already know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 4, we might get:
  - If the word has S at position 4, we get a check? But we don't know.
  - If the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get a minus for position 4 S? Because the S is already accounted for at position 5? Actually, the feedback marks each letter individually. So if the word has only one S, then the S at position 4 would be marked as absent? But we already have a S at position 5, so the S at position 4 would be an extra? And if the word has only one S, then the S at position 4 would be x? Because the S is already used at position 5? Actually, no: the feedback doesn't consider duplicates? 

Wait, the rules: each letter is marked independently. But if the word has only one S, and we guess two S's, then:
  - The S at position 5: correct (check)
  - The S at position 4: since the word has only one S and it's already used at position 5, the S at position 4 would be marked as absent? Actually, no: the feedback should mark it as absent because the S is not in the word? But we know the word has an S at position 5, so the S at position 4 would be an extra? And if the word has only one S, then the S at position 4 would be x? Because the S is already accounted for by the position 5 S? Actually, the feedback doesn't mark the S at position 4 as present? Because the S is already used? 

But the rules: each letter is marked based on the actual occurrences. So if the word has one S, and we guess two S's, then:
  - The S at position 5: correct (check)
  - The S at position 4: since the word has only one S and it's already used at position 5, the S at position 4 would be marked as absent (x)? Because the S is not in the word? But wait, the word has one S, so the S at position 4 is not present? So we get x for that S.

But we are testing E at position 3? So we can get:
  - If E is at position 3, we get a check? But we don't know if E is at position 3 or 4.
  - If we get a minus for E, then E is not at position 3, so it must be at position 4.

But we are also testing H and the fourth letter S? But we are testing S at position 4? And if we get x for the S at position 4, then the word has only one S (at position 5) and E must be at position 4? Because we are testing E at position 3 and getting a minus? Then E must be at position 4? Because we know it's not at 1,2,5.

But wait, if we get a minus for E at position 3, then E is in the word but not at 3, so it must be at 4? But we are not sure if E is at 4? We are testing position 3.

Alternatively, we can try to test E at position 4 without testing duplicate S? 

How about ""COPES"": C O P E S -> tests O and P, and E at position 4.

This avoids duplicates and tests two new letters.

Similarly, ""CUSES"": tests U and duplicate S? But duplicate S: we are testing S at position 3 and 4? And we already know S is at position 5.

But to avoid complexity, let's try ""COPES"".

But wait: what if the word has E at position 3? Then ""COPES"" would not test position 3? Actually, we are testing E at position 4? 

In ""COPES"": 
  Position 1: C (fixed)
  Position 2: O (new)
  Position 3: P (new)
  Position 4: E (we are testing if E is at position 4)
  Position 5: S (fixed)

If we get:
  - If E is at position 4, we get a check? Or if it's at position 3, we get a minus? And then we know E is at position 3? But we are testing position 4.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E at position 3 and tests two new letters? For example: ""CHEPS"" (C H E P S) -> tests H and P.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider: we have not tested position 2 and 3 (except that position 3 is not E? from guess1 we know position 3 is not E? Actually, guess1: E was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position, so position 3 is still possible? And we haven't tested position 3 for E? We tested position 2 and 5? Only position 5 for E? Actually, we tested position 2 and 5? And position 3 and 4 are untested.

But in guess1, we had E at position 5 and got a minus? So E is in the word but not at 5. We haven't tested position 3 and 4 for E? So we can test E at position 3 in this guess.

So let's try to test E at position 3? Then we can see if it's correct.

But we are also testing other letters.

We have two fixed letters: C and S. And we know E is in the word.

So we can try:

Word: ""CHESS"" — but duplicate S? And we are testing S at position 4? And E at position 3.

But let me see: if the word has E at position 3, then we get a check for E? And if we get a minus for E, then E is not at position 3, so it must be at position 4.

Also, we test H and the fourth letter S? But if the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get x for the S at position 4? And then we know the fourth letter is not S? And E must be at position 4? Because we have E present and not at 3? And we haven't tested position 4 for E? Actually, we haven't tested position 4 at all? Only position 5 (in guess1) and position 2 (in guess2) were tested? For E, we tested position 5 (guess1) and position 2 (guess2) and got minuses? So position 3 and 4 are untested for E.

So if we test E at position 3 (as in ""CHESS"") and we get a minus, then E is not at position 3, so it must be at position 4? And if we get a check, then E is at position 3.

But we are also testing the letter at position 4? In ""CHESS"", position 4 is S? But we are testing S at position 4? And if the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get x for the S at position 4? And then we know the fourth letter is not S? And E must be at position 4? Because we have E present and not at 3? But wait, if we get a minus for E at position 3, then E is not at position 3, so it must be at position 4? Because we know E is in the word and not at 1,2,5. So position 4 is the only possibility? But we are testing position 3 for E? And if we get a minus, then E is at position 4.

But we are also testing S at position 4? And if we get x for the S at position 4, then the word has only one S (at position 5). Then E must be at position 4? Because we have E present and not at 3? And we haven't tested position 4 for E? Actually, we haven't tested position 4? Only position 5 (guess1) and position 2 (guess2) were tested? So position 4 is unknown.

So if we guess ""CHESS"":
  - If E is at position 3, we get a check for E? And if we get a minus for E, then E is not at position 3, so it must be at position 4? And then we know the fourth letter is S? But we are testing S at position 4? And if we get a minus for S at position 4, that would mean the word has only one S (at position 5) and E is at position 4? Then the word is C _ _ E S? But we have the fifth letter as S? So it would be C _ _ E S? But we have the fourth letter E? And fifth S? So the word is C ? ? E S.

But we don't know the second and third letters.

But we are testing H at position 2 and S at position 4? And if we get a minus for S at position 4, then the word has only one S (at position 5) and E at position 4? Then the word is C ? ? E S.

But we don't know the second and third letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have duplicate S? 

How about ""CHEPS"": C H E P S -> no duplicate. This tests H at position 2 and P at position 4.

If we get:
  - If E is at position 3, we get a check? And if we get a minus for E, then E is not at position 3, so it must be at position 4? And then we know the fourth letter is not P? And we have the fifth as S? So the word is C ? ? E S? And we know the second letter is not H? And the third letter is not E? But we already know E is not at position 3? Because in guess1, E was at position 5 and got a minus? Meaning the E is present but not at 5? It doesn't say anything about position 3? So position 3 could have E? Actually, no: in guess1, we tested E at position 5 and got a minus? That means E is in the word but not at position 5? It doesn't tell us about position 3? We haven't tested position 3 for E? We tested position 2 and 5? So position 3 is unknown.

So if we guess ""CHEPS"":
  - If E is at position 3, we get a check? Then we know E is at 3? And then we only need to find the second and third letters? But we don't know the third? And the fourth? But we are testing P at position 4? And H at position 2? And if we get checks for H and P? Then we have the word? But we don't know if E is at position 3? We are testing it.

But if E is not at position 3, then we get a minus for E? And then we know E must be at position 4? And then the word is C ? ? E S? And we have H at position 2? And P at position 4? But we don't know if H and P are in the word? 

But we are testing two new letters: H and P.

Alternatively, we can try ""CHEFS"": but that might not be common.

Another word: ""CHEVY"" — no.

How about ""CHEWY""? No.

""CHIPS"" doesn't have E.

So let's consider ""CHEPS"" or ""CHESS"". But ""CHESS"" has duplicate S? And we are testing S at position 4? Which might be a duplicate? 

But we can try ""CHEPS"" to avoid duplicate.

But what about ""CHEFS""? It might be accepted? But let's see: ""chefs"" is not standard.

Another word: ""CHEVY"" — no.

""CHINE"" — but has N? N is absent? So invalid.

""CHIVES"" — not common.

""CHOPS"" — but ends with S? C H O P S -> but then E is not in the word? But we know E is in the word, so we must include E? So we cannot use ""CHOPS"".

We must have E.

So how about ""CHEAP"" — but has A? A is absent.

""CHEEK"" — has E at position 3? And K? But ends with K? Not S.

We need to end with S.

So words ending with S and having E at position 3: 
  - ""CHESS"" (if we allow duplicate S? But we don't know if the word has two S's)
  - ""CHEPS"" (no duplicate)
  - ""CHEFS"" (no duplicate, but ""chefs"" is not common)
  - ""CHEWY"" (no S at the end)

Or words with E at position 4: 
  - ""COPES"" (no duplicate)
  - ""CUSES"" (duplicate S)
  - ""CIVES"" (not common)
  - ""CIDES"" (not common)

So ""COPES"" is a valid and common word? Actually, ""copes"" is a word (meaning: a type of tree or to cover with cups).

But we haven't tested O and P.

Alternatively, we can try ""CUSES"": but that has duplicate S? And we are testing S at position 3? And position 4 is E? So ""CUSES"": C U S E S -> tests U and duplicate S? And we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 3, we might get:
  - If the word has S at position 3, we get a check? But we don't know.
  - If the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get a minus for S at position 3? And then we know the word has only one S? And E must be at position 4? Then the word is C ? ? E S? And we have U at position 2? And the third letter is unknown? But we get feedback on U? And the third letter? 

But we are testing U and the third letter? But we don't know if U is in the word.

But we are testing two new letters? And we are testing the position of E.

But we have to choose one.

Given that we have only 4 guesses left, we want to maximize information.

We know the word is C _ _ _ S, and E is in position 3 or 4.

We can try to test both possibilities? But we can only test one at a time.

We can choose a word that has E in position 3 and tests two new letters? Or in position 4?

But we don't know which one? So we have to pick one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have E? But we know E is in the word, so we should include E to get more information about its position? But we already know E is present? And we are testing position 3? Or 4?

But we have two positions: 2 and 3 (if E is at 3) or 2 and 4 (if E is at 4). But we don't know which one.

So we can try a word that has E at position 3 and tests two new letters? Then we can see if E is at position 3? If we get a check for E, then we know E is at 3? And if we get a minus, then E must be at position 4? Because we know it's not at 1,2,5? And we haven't tested position 4? But we are testing position 3.

But we are also testing the fourth letter? In ""CHEPS"", we are testing P at position 4? And E at position 3.

Similarly, if we choose ""COPES"", we are testing E at position 4? And P at position 3? And O at position 2.

Which one to choose?

We can also consider that we have not tested many vowels: O, U, I? So testing O or U might be good.

But we have to pick one.

Let me list the possibilities:

Case 1: E at position 3 -> word: C H E ? S (where ? is a letter not in {R, A, N, L, T, and not C, E, S? But C and S are fixed, so the second letter can be any new letter, and the fourth letter can be any new letter? But we must avoid R, A, N, L, T.

So for E at position 3: 
  - The fourth letter must be a letter not in the absent list? And not S? Because we are testing position 3 for E? And we are testing the fourth letter? 

Possible words: 
  - ""CHESS"" (H, F) -> but duplicate S? And F is new? And we are testing S at position 4? But we already know S is at position 5? So if we get a minus for S at position 4, then the word has only one S? And E must be at position 4? Then the word is C ? ? E S? And we have H at position 2? And the third letter is unknown? And F at position 4? Actually, ""CHESS"" is C H E S S -> so position 4 is S? And position 5 is S? So if we get a minus for the S at position 4? That would mean the word has only one S (at position 5) and E is at position 4? Then the word is C ? ? E S? And we have H at position 2? And the third letter is unknown? And we are testing F at position 3? 

But ""CHESS"" is valid.

But we are using duplicate S? And we don't know if duplicate S is present.

Another word: ""CHEFS"" (C H E F S) -> tests H and F, and E at position 3.

Similarly, ""CHEPS"" (C H E P S) -> tests H and P.

But we don't know if H is in the word? We haven't tested H? So we can test H? And P? 

We can also try a word that doesn't have H? For example, ""CHEFS"" or ""CHEPS"".

But let me see: we have to avoid L, T, R, A, N. So H is allowed.

But we have to consider: if we test E at position 3 and we get a check, then we know E is at 3? And then we only need to find the second and third letters? But we don't know the third? And the fourth? But we are testing F? Or P? Or H? 

But if we get a minus for E at position 3, then E is not at 3? So it must be at 4? And then the word is C ? ? E S? And we have the second letter unknown? And the third letter unknown? And we have the fourth letter E? And fifth S.

Then we can try to find words of the form C ? ? E S? With the second and third letters not in {R, A, N, L, T} and not C, E, S? But C and S are fixed? So the second and third letters can be any new letter? But we must avoid R, A, N, L, T.

So possible words: 
  - ""CHEPS"" (H, P)
  - ""CHEFS"" (H, F)
  - ""CHEWY"" — no, because doesn't end with S.
  - ""CHEVY"" — no.
  - ""CHESS"" (H, F) — but that has duplicate S? And we are testing S at position 4? And we get a minus for S at position 4? Then we know the word has only one S (at position 5) and E at position 4? Then the word is C ? ? E S? And we have H at position 2? And the third letter is unknown? And we have F at position 3? So ""CHESS"" would be the word? But we are guessing it? And if it's correct, we win? But if not, we get feedback.

But we are limited to 4 guesses? We are on guess 3.

But we have to make a guess.

Another idea: we can try a word that doesn't have E? But we know E is in the word, so we should include E? Because we are trying to find its position? And we have two positions left? But we are testing position 3? Or 4? 

We can also try to test position 4 for E? Without testing position 3? 

For example, we can try ""COPES"": C O P E S -> tests O at position 2, P at position 3, and E at position 4.

If E is at position 4, we get a check for E? And if we get a minus for E, then E is not at position 4? So it must be at position 3? And then the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O at position 2? And P at position 3? And the fourth letter is unknown? 

But we are testing O and P? And we get information about O and P.

Similarly, we can try ""COPES"" to test E at position 4? And we get:
  - If E is at position 4, we get a check? Then we know E is at 4? And then we only need to find the second and third letters? But we don't know the third? And the fourth is E? Fifth is S? So the word is C ? ? E S? And we have O at 2? And P at 3? And the third letter is unknown? 

But if we get a minus for E at position 4? Then E is not at 4? So it must be at 3? And then the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O at 2? And P at 3? And the fourth letter is unknown? 

But we are testing O and P? And we get feedback on their presence.

But we have two good candidates: ""CHESS"" (with duplicate S) and ""CHEPS"" (with duplicate? No: ""CHEPS"" has H, E, P, S? No duplicate? ""CHEPS"" is C H E P S -> no duplicate.

""CHEPS"" tests H and P? And E at position 3.

But we are testing the same thing: we are testing position 3 for E? And if we get a minus, then E is at position 4? And we know the fourth letter is not P? And we have H at position 2? But we don't know if H is in the word? 

But we are testing two new letters? And we are testing the position of E.

But we can also try to test multiple new letters? 

Another word: ""CUBES"" — but we have U? And B? But we haven't tested B? But we are avoiding R, A, N, L, T? So ""CUBES"" has U and B? And E at position 4? So that's acceptable? But we are testing U and B? And E at position 4.

But we don't know if U and B are in the word.

We can also try ""COPES"" to test E at position 4? And tests O and P? And we avoid duplicate? 

But let me check: ""COPES"" is C O P E S? No duplicate? And tests O and P? 

But we have to see if we can get more information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 4? And tests two new vowels? Or consonants? 

How about ""COPES"" and ""CHEPS"" are both good? 

But we have to choose one.

Let me see the frequency of letters? We want to test common letters.

We haven't tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Common letters: O, P, H, D, M, etc.

So ""COPES"" tests O and P? And ""CHEPS"" tests H and P? 

But we are testing H in both? And P in both? 

But we can try ""COPES"" to test a vowel? 

But we have two vowels left? We haven't tested O? Or U? 

We can also try ""CUBES"": C U B E S -> tests U and B? And E at position 4.

But we are testing U and B? 

But we have many letters to test? We can test multiple.

But we are constrained by the pattern.

I think ""COPES"" is a good choice because it tests two common letters: O and P? And we avoid duplicates? 

But let me see: if we guess ""COPES"", and the word is ""CHESS"", then we get:
  - C: ✓
  - O: x (if the word is ""CHESS"", which has no O? And no P? But ""CHESS"" has H and F? So O and P are absent? And E: we are testing E at position 4? But in ""CHESS"", E is at position 3? So we get a minus for E? Because E is in the word but not at position 4? And we know E is in the word? So we get a minus? And then we know E is at position 3? And the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O and P absent? Then we know the word must be C ? E ? S? And we have to try another.

But we are using one guess to test two new letters? And if we get minuses, we know E is at position 4? And the word is C ? ? E S? And we have two letters to try? 

But we have 4 guesses left? We are on guess 3? So we can do that.

But we can also try to test E at position 4? And also test other common letters? 

How about ""COPES"" tests O and P? And we get feedback on O and P.

But we can also try ""COPES"" to test E at position 4? And if E is not at position 4, then E must be at position 3? And the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O and P? Then we can try ""CHESS"" next? But that has duplicate S? 

But we are testing O and P? And if we get minuses, we know E is at position 3? And the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O and P absent? Then we can try ""CHEFS"" or ""CHEPS"" next? 

But we have many possibilities? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 4? And tests two new vowels? Or consonants? 

How about ""COPES"" and ""CHEPS"" are both good? 

But let me see the feedback we got: 

In guess2, we had ""celts"": 
  C: ✓ (position 1)
  E: - (position 2) -> so E is not at position 2? And we know E is in the word? So E is at 3 or 4? 

We can try to test E at position 4? And also test O? 

But we have to choose one.

I think ""COPES"" is a good choice because it tests two common letters: O and P? And we avoid duplicates? 

So I'll go with ""COPES"".

But let me confirm: 
  ""COPES"": C O P E S

If the word is ""CHESS"", then:
  - C: ✓
  - O: x (not in word)
  - P: x (not in word)
  - E: - (because E is at position 3, not 4? Because ""CHESS"" has E at position 3? So E is present but not at position 4? So we get a minus? And then we know E is at position 3? And the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O and P absent? Then we know the word must be C ? E ? S? And we have to try ""CHESS"" next? But then we use two guesses? 

But we have 4 guesses left? We are on guess 3? So we can do that.

But we can also try to test multiple letters? 

Another word: ""CUBES"" — but that has U and B? And E at position 4? 

But we don't know if U and B are in the word.

I think ""COPES"" is a good choice.

But wait: what if the word is ""COPES""? Then we get it right? 

Or if E is at position 3, and the word is ""CHESS"", then we get:

  C: ✓
  O: x
  P: x
  E: - (because E is at position 3, not 4)
  S: ✓ (position 5)

Then we know the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O and P absent? Then we try ""CHESS"" next? 

But we are using two guesses? 

But we can also try to test more new letters? 

How about ""CUBES"": C U B E S -> tests U and B? 

But we are testing U and B? 

But we have to choose one.

I think ""COPES"" is a good choice because it tests two common letters.

So I'll go with ""COPES"".

But let me see: we have not tested O, P, H, U, B, etc.

Another candidate: ""COPES"" is fine.

But wait: what if the word is ""COPES""? Then we win.

Or if not, we get feedback.

So the next guess: ""COPES""

But note: we are testing position 4 for E? And we get feedback on O and P.

So let's write it.

But we must avoid L, T, R, A, N? ""COPES"" has O, P, E, S? And avoids R, A, N, L, T? Yes.

So <guess>copes</guess>

But let me double-check: 
  We know: 
    Position 1: C (fixed)
    Position 5: S (fixed)
    E is present, not at 2 or 5, so must be at 3 or 4? 
    We are testing position 4? 
    We are testing O at position 2? And P at position 3? 

If we get:
  - If E is at position 4, we get a check? Then we know E is at 4? And then the word is C O P E S? And we have the third letter? But we don't know? Actually, we are testing position 4 for E? And if we get a check, then E is at 4? Then the word is C O P E S? And we have the third letter? But we don't know? 

But if we get a minus for E, then E is not at position 4? So it must be at position 3? And then the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O and P absent? Then the word must be C ? E ? S? And we have to try ""CHESS"" or ""CHEFS"" next? 

But we have more guesses.

So it's acceptable.

Therefore, I choose ""COPES"".

But let me see if there is a word that tests more common letters? 

How about ""COPES"" uses O and P? O is a vowel? And P is a consonant? 

Another word: ""COVES"" — but that has V? And E at position 4? But ""co ves"" is not a common word? 

""COVES"" is a word? Meaning: to cover with vesicles? But it's uncommon.

""COVES"" is not standard.

""COMES"" — not common.

So ""COPES"" is acceptable.

Therefore, the next guess is ""COPES"".

But note: we are testing position 4 for E? And we get feedback on O and P? 

We can also consider ""CUBES"": C U B E S -> tests U and B? 

But I think ""COPES"" is fine.

So I'll go with that.

But wait: what if the word is ""COPES""? Then we win.

If not, we get feedback.

So <guess>copes</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  
  - C ✓ (position 1 correct)  
  - R x (R not in word)  
  - A x (A not in word)  
  - N x (N not in word)  
  - E - (E in word, not position 5)  

- **Guess 2 (celts)**:  
  - C ✓ (position 1 correct)  
  - E - (E in word, not position 2)  
  - L x (L not in word)  
  - T x (T not in word)  
  - S ✓ (position 5 correct)  

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 1: **C**  
   - Position 5: **S**  
   So the word pattern is: **C _ _ _ S**.  

2. **E constraints**:  
   - E is in the word but not at position 2 (from guess 2) or 5 (from guess 1).  
   - **E must be at position 3 or 4**.  
   - The word cannot contain R, A, N (from guess 1), L, T (from guess 2).  

3. **Absent letters**:  
   - R, A, N, L, T are confirmed absent.  

4. **Etesting**:  
   - We need to test if E is at position 3 or 4.  
   - Testing position 3 for E (as in ""CHESS"" or ""CHEPS"") will clarify:  
     - If E is ✓ at position 3, it's correct.  
     - If E is -, it means E is at position 4 (since it can't be at 1, 2, or 5).  
   - Testing position 4 for E (as in ""COPES"") will reveal:  
     - If E is ✓ at position 4, it's correct.  
     - If E is x, it means E is at position 3.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Test E in position 4** to resolve its location (since position 3 is riskier and we haven't tested position 4 for E).  
- **Introduce new common letters** to maximize information:  
  - Avoid R, A, N, L, T.  
  - Prioritize high-frequency letters: **O, P, H, D, M, U**.  
- **Avoid duplicates** for now? But we don't know if duplicates exist.  

### Chosen Guess: ""COPES""
- **C** (position 1): ✓ (fixed)  
- **O** (position 2): Tests a common vowel.  
- **P** (position 3): Tests a common consonant.  
- **E** (position 4): Tests if E is at position 4 (if not, E must be at position 3).  
- **S** (position 5): ✓ (fixed)  

This guess efficiently tests E's position while probing two new letters (O and P). If E is at position 4, we get immediate confirmation. If not, we know E is at position 3 (and the word becomes `C _ E _ S`).",Guess 3: copes -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) O(x) P(x) E(-) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)

 Interpretation:
 - C is correct and in the right position (position 1).
 - R is not in the word at all.
 - A is not in the word at all.
 - N is not in the word at all.
 - E is in the word but in the wrong position (so E is present, but not at position 5).

 Therefore, we know:
 - The first letter is C.
 - The word does not contain R, A, or N.
 - The word contains E, but not at the end (position 5).

 Since the first letter is C, the word starts with C.

 We also know that E is in the word, but not at position 5. Since the first letter is C, E must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4.

 Additionally, we must avoid the letters R, A, N.

 For the next guess, we want to use the known information and try to find a word that:
 - Starts with C (because position 1 is fixed as C).
 - Contains E in positions 2, 3, or 4 (but not position 5).
 - Does not contain R, A, N.

 We also want to test new letters to get more information.

 Let's think of words that start with C and have an E in them (but not at the end). Also, we should avoid R, A, N.

 Possible positions for E: we can try to put E in position 2, 3, or 4.

 We also want to include other common letters that we haven't tried yet. We have used C, R, A, N, E. So we should avoid R, A, N and reuse E (but not at position 5) and we can use new letters.

 Since E is in the word but not at position 5, we can try to put E in position 2, 3, or 4. But note: we don't know which one, so we might want to test multiple possibilities.

 However, we have only 5 letters to work with and we know the first letter is C.

 Let's try to form a word that starts with C and has E in position 2, 3, or 4, and uses new letters.

 We also note that we have eliminated R, A, N. So we must avoid these.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, etc.

 We can try to put E in position 2: then the word would be C E _ _ _

 But we don't know the remaining letters. We can try a word like ""CEILS"" but that is not a word. We need valid words.

 Let's think of words that start with C and have an E:

 Option 1: E in position 2 -> words like ""CELEB"" (not valid), ""CELLO"" (but we have two L's? and we don't know if L is in the word) -> but note: we have to avoid R, A, N.

 ""CELLO"": C E L L O -> but we have two L's. Also, we don't know if L is in the word. But we can try.

 However, we want to maximize new letters. Also, note that we have only 5 positions and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Another idea: since we know E is in the word (but not at position 5) and we know the first letter is C, we can try to put E in position 3 or 4 and use new letters for the other positions.

 Let's list some words that start with C and have an E, and avoid R, A, N.

 Some possibilities:
 - C with E in position 2: ""CE"" + three letters (not R, A, N). Examples: ""CEDED"" (but D is new, and we have E again? but we don't know if D is in the word). However, we are allowed to reuse E? But note: the feedback for E was a minus, meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. It doesn't say anything about having multiple E's. So we can have multiple E's? But we don't know. However, the feedback only marked one E as present (but wrong position). So if we use two E's, we might get more information.

 But we must avoid R, A, N. So for ""CEDED"": C E D E D -> but we have two E's and two D's. It's a valid word. However, we are not sure if the secret word has two E's and two D's.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position and uses common consonants.

 Another common word: ""CHEST"" -> but we have E in position 2? Actually, ""CHEST"" is C H E S T. So E is in position 3. Also, we avoid R, A, N? H, E, S, T: no R, A, N. But note: we have E in position 3. Also, we can test H, S, T.

 However, we must consider that the feedback for E was a minus meaning it is present but not at position 5. So in ""CHEST"", E is at position 3, which is allowed.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess ""crane"" had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has an E, but not at position 5. It doesn't say anything about having E at position 3. So that's allowed.

 However, we also know that the secret word does not have R, A, N. So ""CHEST"" is acceptable.

 But let me check: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in position 4? For example: ""CLOTE"" (but is that a word? not really). Or ""CUPTE"" (not a word).

 How about ""CHEWY""? But that has E at position 3? Actually, ""CHEWY"" is C H E W Y -> E at position 3.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CELLO"": C E L L O -> E at position 2.

 But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to get as much information as possible.

 Since we know the first letter is C and we know E is present (but not at position 5), we can try to use a word that has E in a new position and tests other common letters.

 Let me think of a word that starts with C, has E in position 3 or 4, and uses new letters.

 Another idea: ""CABLE"" -> but we have A? We know A is not in the word (from the first feedback: A was marked as absent). So we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, R, N.

 So ""CABLE"" is invalid because it has A.

 How about ""CEDED""? As I thought earlier: C E D E D -> but that has two E's and two D's. It's a valid word. But we are using E in position 2 and 4? We don't know if the word has two E's. Also, we are using D.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CHILE"": C H I L E -> but E is at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5 (from the first feedback: E was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position, meaning it is in the word but not at position 5). So we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting E at position 5.

 Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting E at position 5.

 So ""CHILE"" has E at position 5 -> not allowed.

 How about ""CHEST"": C H E S T -> E at position 3. This is acceptable.

 Another option: ""CUBES"": C U B E S -> E at position 4. This is also acceptable.

 But note: we have to avoid R, A, N. Both ""CHEST"" and ""CUBES"" avoid these.

 Let me choose ""CHEST"" because it has common letters: H, E, S, T. And we can test H, S, T.

 So the next guess: ""CHEST""

 However, note: we are not sure if the word has H, S, T. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we could try a word that has E in position 2, such as ""CELLO"". But ""CELLO"" uses L and O, which are new.

 But we have two good candidates: ""CHEST"" and ""CELLO"".

 Which one gives more information? 
 - ""CHEST"": tests H, E, S, T (with E at position 3).
 - ""CELLO"": tests E, L, L, O (with E at position 2).

 Then we can compare:

 We know the word has E, so we are testing 4 new letters in ""CHEST"" (H, S, T) and 4 new letters in ""CELLO"" (L, O, and one L and one O). Actually, ""CELLO"" has two L's and two O's? Wait: ""CELLO"" is C E L L O -> two L's and one O.

 We want to maximize the number of new distinct letters? Because we don't know anything about the other four letters.

 I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice because it tests four distinct new letters: H, E, S, T.

 But note: we are reusing E, but that's okay because we are trying to find its position.

 However, we are avoiding R, A, N.

 So I'll go with ""CHEST"".

 But wait: what if the word has E at position 2? Then by putting E at position 3 (as in ""CHEST"") we might get a minus again? But we are testing other positions.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in a position we haven't tried (position 2) to see if it's there.

 Since we know E is present but not at position 5, we can try position 2.

 So let me consider ""CELLO"": 
   C E L L O -> positions: C(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), O(5)

 But note: we know the first letter is C, so we are testing E at position 2. Also, we are testing L and O.

 However, we are using two L's. If the word has only one L, then we might get confusing feedback? But we'll see.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CEILT"" (but that's not a common word) or ""CELEB"" (not valid).

 Another common word: ""CEMENT"" -> but that has E at position 2 and 4? And we avoid R, A, N? M, E, N, T: but we have N? We know N is not in the word! So we cannot use N.

 So ""CEMENT"" is invalid because of N.

 How about ""CELTS"": C E L T S -> E at position 2, and tests L, T, S.

 That's a valid word.

 But we have two options: ""CHEST"", ""CELTS"", ""CELLO"", etc.

 I think ""CELTS"" is a good choice because it tests three new letters (L, T, S) and we avoid the forbidden letters.

 However, we are putting E at position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try to put E in position 4? For example: ""CUPHE"" (not common) or ""CABLE"" (has A, invalid) -> ""CABLE"" is invalid because of A.

 Another word: ""CURED"" -> but has R? We know R is not in the word -> invalid.

 How about ""CUBES"": C U B E S -> E at position 4. This tests U, B, E, S.

 But we have E at position 4? We don't know if that's the correct position, but we are testing.

 We have to choose one.

 Let me think about the frequency of letters. We want to test common letters.

 S, T, L are very common. So ""CHEST"" or ""CELTS"" or ""CELLO"".

 I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice because it tests S and T as well.

 But note: we have already eliminated A, R, N. So we are left with many letters.

 I'll go with ""CHEST"".

 However, wait: the word must be 5 letters and we are avoiding R, A, N. So ""CHEST"" is acceptable.

 So the next guess: ""CHEST""

 But note: we are putting E at position 3. We know E is in the word but not at position 5. Position 3 is a new position.

 However, we must be cautious: if the word has two E's, we might get multiple minuses? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't reuse E? But we know E is in the word, so we should use E to test its position.

 But we are allowed to reuse E? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient? However, we are testing the position of E.

 So I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice.

 However, let me check if there is a word that uses E in a different position and also tests other common letters.

 Another candidate: ""CLOSE"" -> but that has O and S, and E at the end? We cannot put E at the end.

 How about ""CLOUD"": but that doesn't have E? We must include E because we know it's in the word? Actually, we don't have to include E? But if we don't include E, we won't get information about E's position. So we should include E.

 We know E is present, so we must include E in the guess? Actually, no. We can guess without E? But then we wouldn't get information about E's position. So it's better to include E.

 So I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice.

 Let me write it: C H E S T

 But wait: what if the word has E in position 2? Then we get a check for E? But we are putting E in position 3? Actually, in ""CHEST"", E is in position 3.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 2: ""CELTS"" (C E L T S) or ""CEILS"" (C E I L S). But ""CEILS"" is not a common word? Actually, ""CEILS"" is not valid. ""CELEB"" is not valid.

 Another word: ""CESTI"" (not common) or ""CESTI"" is not valid.

 How about ""CETYL"" (C E T Y L) -> but that's not very common.

 I think ""CELTS"" is a good alternative: it tests E at position 2 and L, T, S.

 But we have two good candidates: ""CHEST"" and ""CELTS"".

 I'll choose ""CELTS"" because it tests E in a new position (position 2) and we get to test L, T, S.

 So the next guess: ""CELTS""

 But note: we are putting E at position 2. We know E is in the word, but we don't know if it's at position 2. If we get a check for E, then we know it's at position 2. If we get a minus, then E is in the word but not at position 2 (so it must be at 3 or 4). If we get an x, that would be a contradiction because we know E is in the word? But we shouldn't get an x.

 Actually, we know E is in the word, so we expect either a check (if it's at position 2) or a minus (if it's in the word but not at 2). But note: we have two E's in ""CELTS""? No, only one E.

 ""CELTS"": C E L T S -> one E.

 So we are testing E at position 2 and the letters L, T, S.

 This seems good.

 But wait: what if the word has E at position 4? Then in ""CELTS"", the E at position 2 would be a minus? And we would know that E is not at position 2, so it must be at 3 or 4? But we are testing position 2 first.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 4? For example: ""CUPHE"" is not common. ""CABLE"" is invalid. ""CEDED"" is valid: C E D E D -> but we have E at position 2 and 4? Actually, position 2 is E and position 4 is E? But we don't know if the word has two E's.

 I think ""CELTS"" is a solid choice.

 But note: we are testing 4 new letters. That's good.

 So I'll go with ""CELTS"".

 However, let me check: we have the following constraints:
 - Position 1: C (fixed)
 - The word must contain E (but not at position 5) and we are putting E at position 2.
 - We are avoiding R, A, N.

 So ""CELTS"" is acceptable.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""CELTS"".

 But wait: what if the word has E at position 4? Then we are not testing position 4? But we will get feedback on E: if we get a minus for E, then we know E is not at position 2, so it must be at 3 or 4. And if we get a check for E, then we know it's at position 2.

 So we are learning about E's position.

 Similarly, we are testing L, T, S.

 So let's go with ""CELTS"".

<guess>celts</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- **R**, **A**, and **N** are absent (x).
- **E** is present but not in position 5 (-).

Key deductions:
1. The secret word starts with **C**.
2. **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4).
3. The word **excludes R, A, N**.
4. We need to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, O) while probing **E**'s position.

For the next guess:
- Must start with **C**.
- Must include **E** in position 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).
- Must avoid **R, A, N**.
- Should test high-frequency letters to maximize information.

**Strategy**: Test **E** in position 2 (to check if it's correct) and introduce new common letters: **L, T, S**. The word **""CELTS""** fits:
- Starts with **C**.
- Places **E** in position 2 (to test if correct).
- Uses new letters **L, T, S** (all untested).
- Avoids forbidden letters (R, A, N).

This guess will help narrow down **E**'s position and test three new letters.

<guess>celts</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: celts -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) E(-) L(x) T(x) S(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

Guess 2: ""celts""
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- E: - (in word, wrong position) — note: this is the second time we see E is present but not at position 2.
- L: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)
- S: ✓ (correct position)

So from both guesses, we know:

1. The word starts with C and has S at the end. So the pattern is: C _ _ _ S
2. The word contains E, but not at position 2 (from guess 2) and not at position 5 (from guess 1). Therefore, E must be in position 3 or 4.
3. The word does not contain: R, A, N, L, T.

We also have the following letters tested and absent: R, A, N, L, T.

Now, we need to make a new guess that:
- Starts with C and ends with S (so positions 1 and 5 are fixed: C and S).
- Has E in position 3 or 4 (since it can't be in 1,2,5).
- Avoids the letters: R, A, N, L, T.

We must also test the middle letters. We know position 3 and 4 are candidates for E, and position 2 and 3 (but position 3 is also a candidate for E) — actually, position 2 is still unknown, and position 3 and 4 are unknown.

But note: we have two positions fixed: C at 1 and S at 5. So the word is: C _ _ _ S

We know E is in the word and must be in position 3 or 4.

We need to choose a word that fits: C _ _ _ S, with E in either position 3 or 4, and without R, A, N, L, T.

Also, we must use only valid English words.

Let's think of possible words:

First, if E is in position 3: then the word is C _ E _ S. The second and fourth positions are unknown (but cannot be R, A, N, L, T, and also we know from guess1 and guess2 that R, A, N, L, T are absent).

So for C _ E _ S:
- The second letter can be: any letter except R, A, N, L, T (and also not C, E, S because we are using them? But C and S are fixed at positions 1 and 5, but they can appear again? The feedback doesn't say anything about multiple occurrences, so we can't rule out duplicates. However, we haven't seen any duplicates so far.

But we must avoid the absent letters.

Possible letters for the second position: any letter except R, A, N, L, T. Also, we haven't tested many vowels: O, U, I? Or consonants: B, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.

But we need to form a valid word.

Examples: 
- ""CHESS"" — but that has two S's? And S is at the end? Our pattern is C _ E _ S, so the fourth position must be the last but one? So ""CHESS"" would be C H E S S -> but then the S at position 4 and 5? But we have S at position 5, so if we put S at position 4, that would be a problem? Actually, we don't know if S can be at position 4. The feedback for S in guess2 was a check at position 5, but we don't have information about position 4.

But wait: in guess2, we had ""celts"": C E L T S -> L and T were absent, and S was correct at position 5. So S is only at position 5? Or could it be elsewhere? The feedback doesn't say anything about S being elsewhere. But we don't have evidence of multiple S's.

However, we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication so far.

But let's check the pattern: we have C _ E _ S. The second letter is unknown, and the fourth letter is unknown.

Possible words: 
- ""CHESS"": C H E S S -> but then the fourth letter is S? And the fifth is S? That would be two S's. But we don't know if the word has two S's. Also, H is new.

But note: in guess2, we had S at position 5 and it was correct. If the word had an S at position 4, then in guess2 we would have had a minus for the S at position 5? Actually, no: because the feedback only marks the S at position 5 as correct. If there were an S at position 4, we wouldn't know because we didn't test position 4. But in the feedback for guess2, we only got one S marked (at position 5). So if the word had two S's, then when we guessed ""celts"", we only tested one S (at position 5) and got it correct. The other S (if at position 4) would not be reflected because we didn't guess an S at position 4. So it's possible.

But we must form a valid word.

However, ""CHESS"" is not a common word? Actually, ""chess"" is a word (meaning a type of board or a game). But let's see if there are more common words.

Other possibilities for C _ E _ S:
- ""CHEFS"" — but that would be C H E F S. F is new. This is a valid word (as in ""chefs"").
- ""CHEPS"" — C H E P S. Valid.
- ""CHESS"" — as above.

But what about if E is in position 4? Then the word is C _ _ E S. The third letter is unknown.

So for C _ _ E S:
- ""CUPES"" — not a common word? Actually, ""cupes"" is not standard.
- ""COPES"" — C O P E S -> valid? ""COPES"" is a word (meaning: a type of tree or to cover with cups).
- ""CIDES"" — not common.
- ""CAVES"" — but A is absent.

Alternatively, ""CUSES"" — but that would be C U S E S -> but then E is at position 4? And S at position 3 and 5? But we have S at position 5 fixed, so if we put S at position 3, that would be a duplicate? And position 4 is E? So ""CUSES"" is C U S E S -> positions: C(1), U(2), S(3), E(4), S(5). But we have S at position 5, and if we put S at position 3, that would be a duplicate S? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

But we must avoid A, R, N, L, T.

""CUSES"" has U and S, E. But we have two S's? And S at position 3 and 5. But we are testing position 3 and 4 for E? Actually, in this word, E is at position 4.

But we don't know if E is at position 4 or 3. We only know it's not at 1,2,5.

So let's list possible words:

Option 1: E at position 3: C _ E _ S
- Possible: 
  - ""CHESS"" (H at 2, F at 4)
  - ""CHEPS"" (H at 2, P at 4)
  - ""CHEFS"" (H at 2, F at 4)
  - ""CHEWY"" — but that ends with Y, not S? No, we need to end with S.

Option 2: E at position 4: C _ _ E S
- ""COPES"" (O at 2, P at 3, E at 4, S at 5) -> valid.
- ""CIDES"" — not common.
- ""CUSES"" (U at 2, S at 3, E at 4, S at 5) -> but that has two S's. Is that allowed? Yes, but we don't know if the word has two S's.

But we must avoid the absent letters. ""CUSES"" has U and S, E. S is already known to be in the word (at position 5), but if we put S at position 3, that's a duplicate. We don't know if duplicates are present.

Alternatively, ""COPES"" is a valid word and uses O and P.

But we also have to consider that we are testing position 4 for E? In ""COPES"", E is at position 4.

But we don't know if E is at position 4 or 3. We have to choose a word that will help us distinguish.

We can also consider that we have two positions fixed: 1 and 5, and we know E is in 3 or 4. So we can try to test both possibilities? But we can only test one at a time.

We can choose a word that has E in position 3 and a new letter in position 4? Or vice versa.

But we also want to test other common letters.

We have many letters left to test: for example, we haven't tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

But we are constrained by the pattern: we have to put E in position 3 or 4, and the other two positions must be filled with letters not in the absent list.

Let me try to form a word that tests E in position 3 and introduces two new letters for positions 2 and 4? Or vice versa.

We can try ""CHESS"": 
  - C H E S S -> but then we are putting E at position 3, and S at position 4 and 5? But position 5 is fixed as S, so if we put S at position 4, that's a duplicate. And H is new at position 2.

But we are testing H and F? Actually, ""CHESS"" tests H and F.

But we have two S's? And we are testing S at position 4? We don't know if S is duplicated.

Alternatively, we can try ""CHEFS"": C H E F S -> tests H and F, and E at position 3.

But we are avoiding R, A, N, L, T. So ""CHEFS"" is acceptable? But is ""CHEFS"" a word? It might be informal? Actually, ""chefs"" is not a standard word. The correct word might be ""CHEFS""? But let me think.

Actually, ""CHESS"" is a valid word (as in the game of chess). But it has two S's.

Another word: ""CHEPS"" (meaning: to make something happen) — C H E P S. This tests H and P.

But we have E at position 3.

We can also consider ""CHEWY"" — but that ends with Y, not S.

How about ""CHEVY""? No.

So for E at position 3: we have ""CHESS"", ""CHEPS"", ""CHEFS"", ""CHEW"" (but that's 4 letters, not 5). 5-letter words: ""CHEWY"" doesn't end with S.

""CHIPS"" — but that ends with S? C H I P S -> but then E is not in the word? But we know E is in the word, so we must include E? Actually, we don't have to include E? But if we don't include E, we won't get information about its position. So we should include E.

So we must have E in the word.

Therefore, for the pattern C _ _ _ S, with E in position 3: we have:

- ""CHESS"": tests H and F (and duplicate S? but we don't know if duplicate is allowed)
- ""CHEPS"": tests H and P
- ""CHEFS"": tests H and F (again, duplicate S? but F is new)
- ""CHEWY"": doesn't end with S.

Or ""CUSES"": but that has two S's: C U S E S -> tests U and duplicate S.

But we don't know if duplicates are present. So we can try ""CHESS"" to test H and F, and also the duplicate S? But we are testing position 3 for E and position 4 for S? Actually, in ""CHESS"": 
  Position 1: C (fixed)
  Position 2: H (new)
  Position 3: E (we are testing if E is here)
  Position 4: S (we are testing if S is at position 4? But we already know S is at position 5, so if we get a minus for S at position 4, that would be new information? But we are also testing E at position 3.

But we are using two S's. If the word has only one S, then we might get an x for the S at position 4? But we already know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 4 and it's not present, we get x. But if it is present, we get a minus? But we don't know if there is a duplicate.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicate letters to test more new letters.

For example, ""CHEPS"": C H E P S -> no duplicate, and tests H and P.

Similarly, ""CHEFS"": C H E F S -> tests H and F.

But ""CHEFS"" is not a common word? Actually, it might be considered informal? But let's see.

Another word: ""CHEVY"" — no.

""CHIPS"": C H I P S -> but E is not in the word? So we wouldn't test E. But we know E is in the word, so we must include E. Therefore, we cannot use ""CHIPS"" because it doesn't have E.

We must have E in the word.

So for the pattern with E at position 4: C _ _ E S
- ""COPES"": C O P E S -> tests O and P.
- ""CIDES"": not common.
- ""CUSES"": C U S E S -> tests U and duplicate S.

But ""CUSES"" has duplicate S, and we are testing S at position 3 and 5? But we already know position 5 is S, so if we put S at position 3, we might get:
- If the word has S at position 3, we get a check? But we don't know.
- If the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get a minus for S at position 3? And we also get an x for the S at position 4? Actually, we are testing two S's: one at position 3 and one at position 4. If the word has only one S (at position 5), then:
  - Position 3: S -> we guess S, but the word has only one S, so we get a minus (because S is in the word but not at position 3). And position 4: S -> we have an S at position 4? But the word has only one S, so the S at position 4 would be an extra? Actually, no: if the word has only one S, then the S at position 3 (if present) would be a minus, and the S at position 4 would be x? Because the S is already accounted for at position 5? Actually, no: the feedback marks each letter individually. If the word has one S, and we guess two S's, then:
  - The S at position 3: since the word has only one S and it's at position 5, we mark the S at position 3 as absent? Actually, no: the feedback marks based on the actual occurrences. Since the word has one S, and we have two S's in the guess, then:
    - The S at position 3: because the word has only one S and it's at position 5, this S is not in the word? Actually, no: the word has one S, so the S at position 3 is not in the word? But wait, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, we get a minus. If it's not in the word at all, we get x. But we know the word has at least one S (at position 5). So if we put an extra S, it might be marked as present but wrong position? Or if the word has two S's, then it might be marked as present? But we don't know.

This is getting complicated. To avoid confusion, maybe we should avoid using duplicate letters for now? Because we don't know if duplicates are present.

So let's try to avoid duplicates.

Therefore, for the pattern with E at position 4: C _ _ E S, we can try:

- ""COPES"": C O P E S -> tests O and P.
- ""CIVES"": not common.
- ""CIDES"": not common.

Or without duplicates: ""COPES"" is acceptable.

For the pattern with E at position 3: C _ E _ S, we can try:

- ""CHEPS"": C H E P S -> tests H and P.
- ""CHEFS"": C H E F S -> tests H and F.
- ""CHEWY"": doesn't end with S.

But ""CHEWY"" is C H E W Y -> not ending with S.

How about ""CHEVY""? No.

""CHIPS"" doesn't have E.

So we need a word that has E and ends with S, and has two new letters.

List of possible words that fit the pattern and avoid forbidden letters:

Pattern: C _ _ _ S, with E in position 3 or 4, and without R, A, N, L, T.

E at position 3:
- ""CHESS"" (H, F) — but duplicate S? Actually, no duplicate: ""CHESS"" has one S? Wait, ""CHESS"" is C-H-E-S-S? That's two S's? Oh, it has two S's: positions 3 and 4 are S and S? Actually: 
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: H
  Position 3: E
  Position 4: S
  Position 5: S

So it has two S's. But we are testing E at position 3 and S at position 4? But we already know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 4, we might get:
  - If the word has S at position 4, we get a check? But we don't know.
  - If the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get a minus for position 4 S? Because the S is already accounted for at position 5? Actually, the feedback marks each letter individually. So if the word has only one S, then the S at position 4 would be marked as absent? But we already have a S at position 5, so the S at position 4 would be an extra? And if the word has only one S, then the S at position 4 would be x? Because the S is already used at position 5? Actually, no: the feedback doesn't consider duplicates? 

Wait, the rules: each letter is marked independently. But if the word has only one S, and we guess two S's, then:
  - The S at position 5: correct (check)
  - The S at position 4: since the word has only one S and it's already used at position 5, the S at position 4 would be marked as absent? Actually, no: the feedback should mark it as absent because the S is not in the word? But we know the word has an S at position 5, so the S at position 4 would be an extra? And if the word has only one S, then the S at position 4 would be x? Because the S is already accounted for by the position 5 S? Actually, the feedback doesn't mark the S at position 4 as present? Because the S is already used? 

But the rules: each letter is marked based on the actual occurrences. So if the word has one S, and we guess two S's, then:
  - The S at position 5: correct (check)
  - The S at position 4: since the word has only one S and it's already used at position 5, the S at position 4 would be marked as absent (x)? Because the S is not in the word? But wait, the word has one S, so the S at position 4 is not present? So we get x for that S.

But we are testing E at position 3? So we can get:
  - If E is at position 3, we get a check? But we don't know if E is at position 3 or 4.
  - If we get a minus for E, then E is not at position 3, so it must be at position 4.

But we are also testing H and the fourth letter S? But we are testing S at position 4? And if we get x for the S at position 4, then the word has only one S (at position 5) and E must be at position 4? Because we are testing E at position 3 and getting a minus? Then E must be at position 4? Because we know it's not at 1,2,5.

But wait, if we get a minus for E at position 3, then E is in the word but not at 3, so it must be at 4? But we are not sure if E is at 4? We are testing position 3.

Alternatively, we can try to test E at position 4 without testing duplicate S? 

How about ""COPES"": C O P E S -> tests O and P, and E at position 4.

This avoids duplicates and tests two new letters.

Similarly, ""CUSES"": tests U and duplicate S? But duplicate S: we are testing S at position 3 and 4? And we already know S is at position 5.

But to avoid complexity, let's try ""COPES"".

But wait: what if the word has E at position 3? Then ""COPES"" would not test position 3? Actually, we are testing E at position 4? 

In ""COPES"": 
  Position 1: C (fixed)
  Position 2: O (new)
  Position 3: P (new)
  Position 4: E (we are testing if E is at position 4)
  Position 5: S (fixed)

If we get:
  - If E is at position 4, we get a check? Or if it's at position 3, we get a minus? And then we know E is at position 3? But we are testing position 4.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E at position 3 and tests two new letters? For example: ""CHEPS"" (C H E P S) -> tests H and P.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider: we have not tested position 2 and 3 (except that position 3 is not E? from guess1 we know position 3 is not E? Actually, guess1: E was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position, so position 3 is still possible? And we haven't tested position 3 for E? We tested position 2 and 5? Only position 5 for E? Actually, we tested position 2 and 5? And position 3 and 4 are untested.

But in guess1, we had E at position 5 and got a minus? So E is in the word but not at 5. We haven't tested position 3 and 4 for E? So we can test E at position 3 in this guess.

So let's try to test E at position 3? Then we can see if it's correct.

But we are also testing other letters.

We have two fixed letters: C and S. And we know E is in the word.

So we can try:

Word: ""CHESS"" — but duplicate S? And we are testing S at position 4? And E at position 3.

But let me see: if the word has E at position 3, then we get a check for E? And if we get a minus for E, then E is not at position 3, so it must be at position 4.

Also, we test H and the fourth letter S? But if the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get x for the S at position 4? And then we know the fourth letter is not S? And E must be at position 4? Because we have E present and not at 3? And we haven't tested position 4 for E? Actually, we haven't tested position 4 at all? Only position 5 (in guess1) and position 2 (in guess2) were tested? For E, we tested position 5 (guess1) and position 2 (guess2) and got minuses? So position 3 and 4 are untested for E.

So if we test E at position 3 (as in ""CHESS"") and we get a minus, then E is not at position 3, so it must be at position 4? And if we get a check, then E is at position 3.

But we are also testing the letter at position 4? In ""CHESS"", position 4 is S? But we are testing S at position 4? And if the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get x for the S at position 4? And then we know the fourth letter is not S? And E must be at position 4? Because we have E present and not at 3? But wait, if we get a minus for E at position 3, then E is not at position 3, so it must be at position 4? Because we know E is in the word and not at 1,2,5. So position 4 is the only possibility? But we are testing position 3 for E? And if we get a minus, then E is at position 4.

But we are also testing S at position 4? And if we get x for the S at position 4, then the word has only one S (at position 5). Then E must be at position 4? Because we have E present and not at 3? And we haven't tested position 4 for E? Actually, we haven't tested position 4? Only position 5 (guess1) and position 2 (guess2) were tested? So position 4 is unknown.

So if we guess ""CHESS"":
  - If E is at position 3, we get a check for E? And if we get a minus for E, then E is not at position 3, so it must be at position 4? And then we know the fourth letter is S? But we are testing S at position 4? And if we get a minus for S at position 4, that would mean the word has only one S (at position 5) and E is at position 4? Then the word is C _ _ E S? But we have the fifth letter as S? So it would be C _ _ E S? But we have the fourth letter E? And fifth S? So the word is C ? ? E S.

But we don't know the second and third letters.

But we are testing H at position 2 and S at position 4? And if we get a minus for S at position 4, then the word has only one S (at position 5) and E at position 4? Then the word is C ? ? E S.

But we don't know the second and third letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have duplicate S? 

How about ""CHEPS"": C H E P S -> no duplicate. This tests H at position 2 and P at position 4.

If we get:
  - If E is at position 3, we get a check? And if we get a minus for E, then E is not at position 3, so it must be at position 4? And then we know the fourth letter is not P? And we have the fifth as S? So the word is C ? ? E S? And we know the second letter is not H? And the third letter is not E? But we already know E is not at position 3? Because in guess1, E was at position 5 and got a minus? Meaning the E is present but not at 5? It doesn't say anything about position 3? So position 3 could have E? Actually, no: in guess1, we tested E at position 5 and got a minus? That means E is in the word but not at position 5? It doesn't tell us about position 3? We haven't tested position 3 for E? We tested position 2 and 5? So position 3 is unknown.

So if we guess ""CHEPS"":
  - If E is at position 3, we get a check? Then we know E is at 3? And then we only need to find the second and third letters? But we don't know the third? And the fourth? But we are testing P at position 4? And H at position 2? And if we get checks for H and P? Then we have the word? But we don't know if E is at position 3? We are testing it.

But if E is not at position 3, then we get a minus for E? And then we know E must be at position 4? And then the word is C ? ? E S? And we have H at position 2? And P at position 4? But we don't know if H and P are in the word? 

But we are testing two new letters: H and P.

Alternatively, we can try ""CHEFS"": but that might not be common.

Another word: ""CHEVY"" — no.

How about ""CHEWY""? No.

""CHIPS"" doesn't have E.

So let's consider ""CHEPS"" or ""CHESS"". But ""CHESS"" has duplicate S? And we are testing S at position 4? Which might be a duplicate? 

But we can try ""CHEPS"" to avoid duplicate.

But what about ""CHEFS""? It might be accepted? But let's see: ""chefs"" is not standard.

Another word: ""CHEVY"" — no.

""CHINE"" — but has N? N is absent? So invalid.

""CHIVES"" — not common.

""CHOPS"" — but ends with S? C H O P S -> but then E is not in the word? But we know E is in the word, so we must include E? So we cannot use ""CHOPS"".

We must have E.

So how about ""CHEAP"" — but has A? A is absent.

""CHEEK"" — has E at position 3? And K? But ends with K? Not S.

We need to end with S.

So words ending with S and having E at position 3: 
  - ""CHESS"" (if we allow duplicate S? But we don't know if the word has two S's)
  - ""CHEPS"" (no duplicate)
  - ""CHEFS"" (no duplicate, but ""chefs"" is not common)
  - ""CHEWY"" (no S at the end)

Or words with E at position 4: 
  - ""COPES"" (no duplicate)
  - ""CUSES"" (duplicate S)
  - ""CIVES"" (not common)
  - ""CIDES"" (not common)

So ""COPES"" is a valid and common word? Actually, ""copes"" is a word (meaning: a type of tree or to cover with cups).

But we haven't tested O and P.

Alternatively, we can try ""CUSES"": but that has duplicate S? And we are testing S at position 3? And position 4 is E? So ""CUSES"": C U S E S -> tests U and duplicate S? And we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 3, we might get:
  - If the word has S at position 3, we get a check? But we don't know.
  - If the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get a minus for S at position 3? And then we know the word has only one S? And E must be at position 4? Then the word is C ? ? E S? And we have U at position 2? And the third letter is unknown? But we get feedback on U? And the third letter? 

But we are testing U and the third letter? But we don't know if U is in the word.

But we are testing two new letters? And we are testing the position of E.

But we have to choose one.

Given that we have only 4 guesses left, we want to maximize information.

We know the word is C _ _ _ S, and E is in position 3 or 4.

We can try to test both possibilities? But we can only test one at a time.

We can choose a word that has E in position 3 and tests two new letters? Or in position 4?

But we don't know which one? So we have to pick one.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have E? But we know E is in the word, so we should include E to get more information about its position? But we already know E is present? And we are testing position 3? Or 4?

But we have two positions: 2 and 3 (if E is at 3) or 2 and 4 (if E is at 4). But we don't know which one.

So we can try a word that has E at position 3 and tests two new letters? Then we can see if E is at position 3? If we get a check for E, then we know E is at 3? And if we get a minus, then E must be at position 4? Because we know it's not at 1,2,5? And we haven't tested position 4? But we are testing position 3.

But we are also testing the fourth letter? In ""CHEPS"", we are testing P at position 4? And E at position 3.

Similarly, if we choose ""COPES"", we are testing E at position 4? And P at position 3? And O at position 2.

Which one to choose?

We can also consider that we have not tested many vowels: O, U, I? So testing O or U might be good.

But we have to pick one.

Let me list the possibilities:

Case 1: E at position 3 -> word: C H E ? S (where ? is a letter not in {R, A, N, L, T, and not C, E, S? But C and S are fixed, so the second letter can be any new letter, and the fourth letter can be any new letter? But we must avoid R, A, N, L, T.

So for E at position 3: 
  - The fourth letter must be a letter not in the absent list? And not S? Because we are testing position 3 for E? And we are testing the fourth letter? 

Possible words: 
  - ""CHESS"" (H, F) -> but duplicate S? And F is new? And we are testing S at position 4? But we already know S is at position 5? So if we get a minus for S at position 4, then the word has only one S? And E must be at position 4? Then the word is C ? ? E S? And we have H at position 2? And the third letter is unknown? And F at position 4? Actually, ""CHESS"" is C H E S S -> so position 4 is S? And position 5 is S? So if we get a minus for the S at position 4? That would mean the word has only one S (at position 5) and E is at position 4? Then the word is C ? ? E S? And we have H at position 2? And the third letter is unknown? And we are testing F at position 3? 

But ""CHESS"" is valid.

But we are using duplicate S? And we don't know if duplicate S is present.

Another word: ""CHEFS"" (C H E F S) -> tests H and F, and E at position 3.

Similarly, ""CHEPS"" (C H E P S) -> tests H and P.

But we don't know if H is in the word? We haven't tested H? So we can test H? And P? 

We can also try a word that doesn't have H? For example, ""CHEFS"" or ""CHEPS"".

But let me see: we have to avoid L, T, R, A, N. So H is allowed.

But we have to consider: if we test E at position 3 and we get a check, then we know E is at 3? And then we only need to find the second and third letters? But we don't know the third? And the fourth? But we are testing F? Or P? Or H? 

But if we get a minus for E at position 3, then E is not at 3? So it must be at 4? And then the word is C ? ? E S? And we have the second letter unknown? And the third letter unknown? And we have the fourth letter E? And fifth S.

Then we can try to find words of the form C ? ? E S? With the second and third letters not in {R, A, N, L, T} and not C, E, S? But C and S are fixed? So the second and third letters can be any new letter? But we must avoid R, A, N, L, T.

So possible words: 
  - ""CHEPS"" (H, P)
  - ""CHEFS"" (H, F)
  - ""CHEWY"" — no, because doesn't end with S.
  - ""CHEVY"" — no.
  - ""CHESS"" (H, F) — but that has duplicate S? And we are testing S at position 4? And we get a minus for S at position 4? Then we know the word has only one S (at position 5) and E at position 4? Then the word is C ? ? E S? And we have H at position 2? And the third letter is unknown? And we have F at position 3? So ""CHESS"" would be the word? But we are guessing it? And if it's correct, we win? But if not, we get feedback.

But we are limited to 4 guesses? We are on guess 3.

But we have to make a guess.

Another idea: we can try a word that doesn't have E? But we know E is in the word, so we should include E? Because we are trying to find its position? And we have two positions left? But we are testing position 3? Or 4? 

We can also try to test position 4 for E? Without testing position 3? 

For example, we can try ""COPES"": C O P E S -> tests O at position 2, P at position 3, and E at position 4.

If E is at position 4, we get a check for E? And if we get a minus for E, then E is not at position 4? So it must be at position 3? And then the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O at position 2? And P at position 3? And the fourth letter is unknown? 

But we are testing O and P? And we get information about O and P.

Similarly, we can try ""COPES"" to test E at position 4? And we get:
  - If E is at position 4, we get a check? Then we know E is at 4? And then we only need to find the second and third letters? But we don't know the third? And the fourth is E? Fifth is S? So the word is C ? ? E S? And we have O at 2? And P at 3? And the third letter is unknown? 

But if we get a minus for E at position 4? Then E is not at 4? So it must be at 3? And then the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O at 2? And P at 3? And the fourth letter is unknown? 

But we are testing O and P? And we get feedback on their presence.

But we have two good candidates: ""CHESS"" (with duplicate S) and ""CHEPS"" (with duplicate? No: ""CHEPS"" has H, E, P, S? No duplicate? ""CHEPS"" is C H E P S -> no duplicate.

""CHEPS"" tests H and P? And E at position 3.

But we are testing the same thing: we are testing position 3 for E? And if we get a minus, then E is at position 4? And we know the fourth letter is not P? And we have H at position 2? But we don't know if H is in the word? 

But we are testing two new letters? And we are testing the position of E.

But we can also try to test multiple new letters? 

Another word: ""CUBES"" — but we have U? And B? But we haven't tested B? But we are avoiding R, A, N, L, T? So ""CUBES"" has U and B? And E at position 4? So that's acceptable? But we are testing U and B? And E at position 4.

But we don't know if U and B are in the word.

We can also try ""COPES"" to test E at position 4? And tests O and P? And we avoid duplicate? 

But let me check: ""COPES"" is C O P E S? No duplicate? And tests O and P? 

But we have to see if we can get more information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 4? And tests two new vowels? Or consonants? 

How about ""COPES"" and ""CHEPS"" are both good? 

But we have to choose one.

Let me see the frequency of letters? We want to test common letters.

We haven't tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Common letters: O, P, H, D, M, etc.

So ""COPES"" tests O and P? And ""CHEPS"" tests H and P? 

But we are testing H in both? And P in both? 

But we can try ""COPES"" to test a vowel? 

But we have two vowels left? We haven't tested O? Or U? 

We can also try ""CUBES"": C U B E S -> tests U and B? And E at position 4.

But we are testing U and B? 

But we have many letters to test? We can test multiple.

But we are constrained by the pattern.

I think ""COPES"" is a good choice because it tests two common letters: O and P? And we avoid duplicates? 

But let me see: if we guess ""COPES"", and the word is ""CHESS"", then we get:
  - C: ✓
  - O: x (if the word is ""CHESS"", which has no O? And no P? But ""CHESS"" has H and F? So O and P are absent? And E: we are testing E at position 4? But in ""CHESS"", E is at position 3? So we get a minus for E? Because E is in the word but not at position 4? And we know E is in the word? So we get a minus? And then we know E is at position 3? And the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O and P absent? Then we know the word must be C ? E ? S? And we have to try another.

But we are using one guess to test two new letters? And if we get minuses, we know E is at position 4? And the word is C ? ? E S? And we have two letters to try? 

But we have 4 guesses left? We are on guess 3? So we can do that.

But we can also try to test E at position 4? And also test other common letters? 

How about ""COPES"" tests O and P? And we get feedback on O and P.

But we can also try ""COPES"" to test E at position 4? And if E is not at position 4, then E must be at position 3? And the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O and P? Then we can try ""CHESS"" next? But that has duplicate S? 

But we are testing O and P? And if we get minuses, we know E is at position 3? And the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O and P absent? Then we can try ""CHEFS"" or ""CHEPS"" next? 

But we have many possibilities? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 4? And tests two new vowels? Or consonants? 

How about ""COPES"" and ""CHEPS"" are both good? 

But let me see the feedback we got: 

In guess2, we had ""celts"": 
  C: ✓ (position 1)
  E: - (position 2) -> so E is not at position 2? And we know E is in the word? So E is at 3 or 4? 

We can try to test E at position 4? And also test O? 

But we have to choose one.

I think ""COPES"" is a good choice because it tests two common letters: O and P? And we avoid duplicates? 

So I'll go with ""COPES"".

But let me confirm: 
  ""COPES"": C O P E S

If the word is ""CHESS"", then:
  - C: ✓
  - O: x (not in word)
  - P: x (not in word)
  - E: - (because E is at position 3, not 4? Because ""CHESS"" has E at position 3? So E is present but not at position 4? So we get a minus? And then we know E is at position 3? And the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O and P absent? Then we know the word must be C ? E ? S? And we have to try ""CHESS"" next? But then we use two guesses? 

But we have 4 guesses left? We are on guess 3? So we can do that.

But we can also try to test multiple letters? 

Another word: ""CUBES"" — but that has U and B? And E at position 4? 

But we don't know if U and B are in the word.

I think ""COPES"" is a good choice.

But wait: what if the word is ""COPES""? Then we get it right? 

Or if E is at position 3, and the word is ""CHESS"", then we get:

  C: ✓
  O: x
  P: x
  E: - (because E is at position 3, not 4)
  S: ✓ (position 5)

Then we know the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O and P absent? Then we try ""CHESS"" next? 

But we are using two guesses? 

But we can also try to test more new letters? 

How about ""CUBES"": C U B E S -> tests U and B? 

But we are testing U and B? 

But we have to choose one.

I think ""COPES"" is a good choice because it tests two common letters.

So I'll go with ""COPES"".

But let me see: we have not tested O, P, H, U, B, etc.

Another candidate: ""COPES"" is fine.

But wait: what if the word is ""COPES""? Then we win.

Or if not, we get feedback.

So the next guess: ""COPES""

But note: we are testing position 4 for E? And we get feedback on O and P.

So let's write it.

But we must avoid L, T, R, A, N? ""COPES"" has O, P, E, S? And avoids R, A, N, L, T? Yes.

So <guess>copes</guess>

But let me double-check: 
  We know: 
    Position 1: C (fixed)
    Position 5: S (fixed)
    E is present, not at 2 or 5, so must be at 3 or 4? 
    We are testing position 4? 
    We are testing O at position 2? And P at position 3? 

If we get:
  - If E is at position 4, we get a check? Then we know E is at 4? And then the word is C O P E S? And we have the third letter? But we don't know? Actually, we are testing position 4 for E? And if we get a check, then E is at 4? Then the word is C O P E S? And we have the third letter? But we don't know? 

But if we get a minus for E, then E is not at position 4? So it must be at position 3? And then the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O and P absent? Then the word must be C ? E ? S? And we have to try ""CHESS"" or ""CHEFS"" next? 

But we have more guesses.

So it's acceptable.

Therefore, I choose ""COPES"".

But let me see if there is a word that tests more common letters? 

How about ""COPES"" uses O and P? O is a vowel? And P is a consonant? 

Another word: ""COVES"" — but that has V? And E at position 4? But ""co ves"" is not a common word? 

""COVES"" is a word? Meaning: to cover with vesicles? But it's uncommon.

""COVES"" is not standard.

""COMES"" — not common.

So ""COPES"" is acceptable.

Therefore, the next guess is ""COPES"".

But note: we are testing position 4 for E? And we get feedback on O and P? 

We can also consider ""CUBES"": C U B E S -> tests U and B? 

But I think ""COPES"" is fine.

So I'll go with that.

But wait: what if the word is ""COPES""? Then we win.

If not, we get feedback.

So <guess>copes</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  
  - C ✓ (position 1 correct)  
  - R x (R not in word)  
  - A x (A not in word)  
  - N x (N not in word)  
  - E - (E in word, not position 5)  

- **Guess 2 (celts)**:  
  - C ✓ (position 1 correct)  
  - E - (E in word, not position 2)  
  - L x (L not in word)  
  - T x (T not in word)  
  - S ✓ (position 5 correct)  

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 1: **C**  
   - Position 5: **S**  
   So the word pattern is: **C _ _ _ S**.  

2. **E constraints**:  
   - E is in the word but not at position 2 (from guess 2) or 5 (from guess 1).  
   - **E must be at position 3 or 4**.  
   - The word cannot contain R, A, N (from guess 1), L, T (from guess 2).  

3. **Absent letters**:  
   - R, A, N, L, T are confirmed absent.  

4. **Etesting**:  
   - We need to test if E is at position 3 or 4.  
   - Testing position 3 for E (as in ""CHESS"" or ""CHEPS"") will clarify:  
     - If E is ✓ at position 3, it's correct.  
     - If E is -, it means E is at position 4 (since it can't be at 1, 2, or 5).  
   - Testing position 4 for E (as in ""COPES"") will reveal:  
     - If E is ✓ at position 4, it's correct.  
     - If E is x, it means E is at position 3.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Test E in position 4** to resolve its location (since position 3 is riskier and we haven't tested position 4 for E).  
- **Introduce new common letters** to maximize information:  
  - Avoid R, A, N, L, T.  
  - Prioritize high-frequency letters: **O, P, H, D, M, U**.  
- **Avoid duplicates** for now? But we don't know if duplicates exist.  

### Chosen Guess: ""COPES""
- **C** (position 1): ✓ (fixed)  
- **O** (position 2): Tests a common vowel.  
- **P** (position 3): Tests a common consonant.  
- **E** (position 4): Tests if E is at position 4 (if not, E must be at position 3).  
- **S** (position 5): ✓ (fixed)  

This guess efficiently tests E's position while probing two new letters (O and P). If E is at position 4, we get immediate confirmation. If not, we know E is at position 3 (and the word becomes `C _ E _ S`).

Since the first letter is C, E must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4.\n\n Additionally, we must avoid the letters R, A, N.\n\n For the next guess, we want to use the known information and try to find a word that:\n - Starts with C (because position 1 is fixed as C).\n - Contains E in positions 2, 3, or 4 (but not position 5).\n - Does not contain R, A, N.\n\n We also want to test new letters to get more information.\n\n Let\'s think of words that start with C and have an E in them (but not at the end). Also, we should avoid R, A, N.\n\n Possible positions for E: we can try to put E in position 2, 3, or 4.\n\n We also want to include other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet. We have used C, R, A, N, E. So we should avoid R, A, N and reuse E (but not at position 5) and we can use new letters.\n\n Since E is in the word but not at position 5, we can try to put E in position 2, 3, or 4. But note: we don\'t know which one, so we might want to test multiple possibilities.\n\n However, we have only 5 letters to work with and we know the first letter is C.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that starts with C and has E in position 2, 3, or 4, and uses new letters.\n\n We also note that we have eliminated R, A, N. So we must avoid these.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, G, H, etc.\n\n We can try to put E in position 2: then the word would be C E _ _ _\n\n But we don\'t know the remaining letters. We can try a word like ""CEILS"" but that is not a word. We need valid words.\n\n Let\'s think of words that start with C and have an E:\n\n Option 1: E in position 2 -> words like ""CELEB"" (not valid), ""CELLO"" (but we have two L\'s? and we don\'t know if L is in the word) -> but note: we have to avoid R, A, N.\n\n ""CELLO"": C E L L O -> but we have two L\'s. Also, we don\'t know if L is in the word. But we can try.\n\n However, we want to maximize new letters. Also, note that we have only 5 positions and we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Another idea: since we know E is in the word (but not at position 5) and we know the first letter is C, we can try to put E in position 3 or 4 and use new letters for the other positions.\n\n Let\'s list some words that start with C and have an E, and avoid R, A, N.\n\n Some possibilities:\n - C with E in position 2: ""CE"" + three letters (not R, A, N). Examples: ""CEDED"" (but D is new, and we have E again? but we don\'t know if D is in the word). However, we are allowed to reuse E? But note: the feedback for E was a minus, meaning it is in the word but not at position 5. It doesn\'t say anything about having multiple E\'s. So we can have multiple E\'s? But we don\'t know. However, the feedback only marked one E as present (but wrong position). So if we use two E\'s, we might get more information.\n\n But we must avoid R, A, N. So for ""CEDED"": C E D E D -> but we have two E\'s and two D\'s. It\'s a valid word. However, we are not sure if the secret word has two E\'s and two D\'s.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position and uses common consonants.\n\n Another common word: ""CHEST"" -> but we have E in position 2? Actually, ""CHEST"" is C H E S T. So E is in position 3. Also, we avoid R, A, N? H, E, S, T: no R, A, N. But note: we have E in position 3. Also, we can test H, S, T.\n\n However, we must consider that the feedback for E was a minus meaning it is present but not at position 5. So in ""CHEST"", E is at position 3, which is allowed.\n\n But wait: the feedback for the first guess ""crane"" had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the secret word has an E, but not at position 5. It doesn\'t say anything about having E at position 3. So that\'s allowed.\n\n However, we also know that the secret word does not have R, A, N. So ""CHEST"" is acceptable.\n\n But let me check: the word must be 5 letters and valid.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put E in position 4? For example: ""CLOTE"" (but is that a word? not really). Or ""CUPTE"" (not a word).\n\n How about ""CHEWY""? But that has E at position 3? Actually, ""CHEWY"" is C H E W Y -> E at position 3.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""CELLO"": C E L L O -> E at position 2.\n\n But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to get as much information as possible.\n\n Since we know the first letter is C and we know E is present (but not at position 5), we can try to use a word that has E in a new position and tests other common letters.\n\n Let me think of a word that starts with C, has E in position 3 or 4, and uses new letters.\n\n Another idea: ""CABLE"" -> but we have A? We know A is not in the word (from the first feedback: A was marked as absent). So we cannot use A.\n\n We must avoid A, R, N.\n\n So ""CABLE"" is invalid because it has A.\n\n How about ""CEDED""? As I thought earlier: C E D E D -> but that has two E\'s and two D\'s. It\'s a valid word. But we are using E in position 2 and 4? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, we are using D.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""CHILE"": C H I L E -> but E is at position 5? But we know E is not at position 5 (from the first feedback: E was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position, meaning it is in the word but not at position 5). So we cannot put E at position 5 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting E at position 5.\n\n Therefore, in our next guess, we should avoid putting E at position 5.\n\n So ""CHILE"" has E at position 5 -> not allowed.\n\n How about ""CHEST"": C H E S T -> E at position 3. This is acceptable.\n\n Another option: ""CUBES"": C U B E S -> E at position 4. This is also acceptable.\n\n But note: we have to avoid R, A, N. Both ""CHEST"" and ""CUBES"" avoid these.\n\n Let me choose ""CHEST"" because it has common letters: H, E, S, T. And we can test H, S, T.\n\n So the next guess: ""CHEST""\n\n However, note: we are not sure if the word has H, S, T. We are testing them.\n\n Alternatively, we could try a word that has E in position 2, such as ""CELLO"". But ""CELLO"" uses L and O, which are new.\n\n But we have two good candidates: ""CHEST"" and ""CELLO"".\n\n Which one gives more information? \n - ""CHEST"": tests H, E, S, T (with E at position 3).\n - ""CELLO"": tests E, L, L, O (with E at position 2).\n\n Then we can compare:\n\n We know the word has E, so we are testing 4 new letters in ""CHEST"" (H, S, T) and 4 new letters in ""CELLO"" (L, O, and one L and one O). Actually, ""CELLO"" has two L\'s and two O\'s? Wait: ""CELLO"" is C E L L O -> two L\'s and one O.\n\n We want to maximize the number of new distinct letters? Because we don\'t know anything about the other four letters.\n\n I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice because it tests four distinct new letters: H, E, S, T.\n\n But note: we are reusing E, but that\'s okay because we are trying to find its position.\n\n However, we are avoiding R, A, N.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""CHEST"".\n\n But wait: what if the word has E at position 2? Then by putting E at position 3 (as in ""CHEST"") we might get a minus again? But we are testing other positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put E in a position we haven\'t tried (position 2) to see if it\'s there.\n\n Since we know E is present but not at position 5, we can try position 2.\n\n So let me consider ""CELLO"": \n   C E L L O -> positions: C(1), E(2), L(3), L(4), O(5)\n\n But note: we know the first letter is C, so we are testing E at position 2. Also, we are testing L and O.\n\n However, we are using two L\'s. If the word has only one L, then we might get confusing feedback? But we\'ll see.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""CEILT"" (but that\'s not a common word) or ""CELEB"" (not valid).\n\n Another common word: ""CEMENT"" -> but that has E at position 2 and 4? And we avoid R, A, N? M, E, N, T: but we have N? We know N is not in the word! So we cannot use N.\n\n So ""CEMENT"" is invalid because of N.\n\n How about ""CELTS"": C E L T S -> E at position 2, and tests L, T, S.\n\n That\'s a valid word.\n\n But we have two options: ""CHEST"", ""CELTS"", ""CELLO"", etc.\n\n I think ""CELTS"" is a good choice because it tests three new letters (L, T, S) and we avoid the forbidden letters.\n\n However, we are putting E at position 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to put E in position 4? For example: ""CUPHE"" (not common) or ""CABLE"" (has A, invalid) -> ""CABLE"" is invalid because of A.\n\n Another word: ""CURED"" -> but has R? We know R is not in the word -> invalid.\n\n How about ""CUBES"": C U B E S -> E at position 4. This tests U, B, E, S.\n\n But we have E at position 4? We don\'t know if that\'s the correct position, but we are testing.\n\n We have to choose one.\n\n Let me think about the frequency of letters. We want to test common letters.\n\n S, T, L are very common. So ""CHEST"" or ""CELTS"" or ""CELLO"".\n\n I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice because it tests S and T as well.\n\n But note: we have already eliminated A, R, N. So we are left with many letters.\n\n I\'ll go with ""CHEST"".\n\n However, wait: the word must be 5 letters and we are avoiding R, A, N. So ""CHEST"" is acceptable.\n\n So the next guess: ""CHEST""\n\n But note: we are putting E at position 3. We know E is in the word but not at position 5. Position 3 is a new position.\n\n However, we must be cautious: if the word has two E\'s, we might get multiple minuses? But we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t reuse E? But we know E is in the word, so we should use E to test its position.\n\n But we are allowed to reuse E? Actually, we can, but it might be inefficient? However, we are testing the position of E.\n\n So I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice.\n\n However, let me check if there is a word that uses E in a different position and also tests other common letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""CLOSE"" -> but that has O and S, and E at the end? We cannot put E at the end.\n\n How about ""CLOUD"": but that doesn\'t have E? We must include E because we know it\'s in the word? Actually, we don\'t have to include E? But if we don\'t include E, we won\'t get information about E\'s position. So we should include E.\n\n We know E is present, so we must include E in the guess? Actually, no. We can guess without E? But then we wouldn\'t get information about E\'s position. So it\'s better to include E.\n\n So I think ""CHEST"" is a good choice.\n\n Let me write it: C H E S T\n\n But wait: what if the word has E in position 2? Then we get a check for E? But we are putting E in position 3? Actually, in ""CHEST"", E is in position 3.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 2: ""CELTS"" (C E L T S) or ""CEILS"" (C E I L S). But ""CEILS"" is not a common word? Actually, ""CEILS"" is not valid. ""CELEB"" is not valid.\n\n Another word: ""CESTI"" (not common) or ""CESTI"" is not valid.\n\n How about ""CETYL"" (C E T Y L) -> but that\'s not very common.\n\n I think ""CELTS"" is a good alternative: it tests E at position 2 and L, T, S.\n\n But we have two good candidates: ""CHEST"" and ""CELTS"".\n\n I\'ll choose ""CELTS"" because it tests E in a new position (position 2) and we get to test L, T, S.\n\n So the next guess: ""CELTS""\n\n But note: we are putting E at position 2. We know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s at position 2. If we get a check for E, then we know it\'s at position 2. If we get a minus, then E is in the word but not at position 2 (so it must be at 3 or 4). If we get an x, that would be a contradiction because we know E is in the word? But we shouldn\'t get an x.\n\n Actually, we know E is in the word, so we expect either a check (if it\'s at position 2) or a minus (if it\'s in the word but not at 2). But note: we have two E\'s in ""CELTS""? No, only one E.\n\n ""CELTS"": C E L T S -> one E.\n\n So we are testing E at position 2 and the letters L, T, S.\n\n This seems good.\n\n But wait: what if the word has E at position 4? Then in ""CELTS"", the E at position 2 would be a minus? And we would know that E is not at position 2, so it must be at 3 or 4? But we are testing position 2 first.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 4? For example: ""CUPHE"" is not common. ""CABLE"" is invalid. ""CEDED"" is valid: C E D E D -> but we have E at position 2 and 4? Actually, position 2 is E and position 4 is E? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s.\n\n I think ""CELTS"" is a solid choice.\n\n But note: we are testing 4 new letters. That\'s good.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""CELTS"".\n\n However, let me check: we have the following constraints:\n - Position 1: C (fixed)\n - The word must contain E (but not at position 5) and we are putting E at position 2.\n - We are avoiding R, A, N.\n\n So ""CELTS"" is acceptable.\n\n Therefore, the next guess is ""CELTS"".\n\n But wait: what if the word has E at position 4? Then we are not testing position 4? But we will get feedback on E: if we get a minus for E, then we know E is not at position 2, so it must be at 3 or 4. And if we get a check for E, then we know it\'s at position 2.\n\n So we are learning about E\'s position.\n\n Similarly, we are testing L, T, S.\n\n So let\'s go with ""CELTS"".\n\n<guess>celts</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).\n- **R**, **A**, and **N** are absent (x).\n- **E** is present but not in position 5 (-).\n\nKey deductions:\n1. The secret word starts with **C**.\n2. **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (so it must be in position 2, 3, or 4).\n3. The word **excludes R, A, N**.\n4. We need to test new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, O) while probing **E**\'s position.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must start with **C**.\n- Must include **E** in position 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).\n- Must avoid **R, A, N**.\n- Should test high-frequency letters to maximize information.\n\n**Strategy**: Test **E** in position 2 (to check if it\'s correct) and introduce new common letters: **L, T, S**. The word **""CELTS""** fits:\n- Starts with **C**.\n- Places **E** in position 2 (to test if correct).\n- Uses new letters **L, T, S** (all untested).\n- Avoids forbidden letters (R, A, N).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down **E**\'s position and test three new letters.\n\n<guess>celts</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: celts -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) E(-) L(x) T(x) S(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: ✓ (correct position)\n- R: x (not in word)\n- A: x (not in word)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- E: - (in word, wrong position)\n\nGuess 2: ""celts""\n- C: ✓ (correct position)\n- E: - (in word, wrong position) — note: this is the second time we see E is present but not at position 2.\n- L: x (not in word)\n- T: x (not in word)\n- S: ✓ (correct position)\n\nSo from both guesses, we know:\n\n1. The word starts with C and has S at the end. So the pattern is: C _ _ _ S\n2. The word contains E, but not at position 2 (from guess 2) and not at position 5 (from guess 1). Therefore, E must be in position 3 or 4.\n3. The word does not contain: R, A, N, L, T.\n\nWe also have the following letters tested and absent: R, A, N, L, T.\n\nNow, we need to make a new guess that:\n- Starts with C and ends with S (so positions 1 and 5 are fixed: C and S).\n- Has E in position 3 or 4 (since it can\'t be in 1,2,5).\n- Avoids the letters: R, A, N, L, T.\n\nWe must also test the middle letters. We know position 3 and 4 are candidates for E, and position 2 and 3 (but position 3 is also a candidate for E) — actually, position 2 is still unknown, and position 3 and 4 are unknown.\n\nBut note: we have two positions fixed: C at 1 and S at 5. So the word is: C _ _ _ S\n\nWe know E is in the word and must be in position 3 or 4.\n\nWe need to choose a word that fits: C _ _ _ S, with E in either position 3 or 4, and without R, A, N, L, T.\n\nAlso, we must use only valid English words.\n\nLet\'s think of possible words:\n\nFirst, if E is in position 3: then the word is C _ E _ S. The second and fourth positions are unknown (but cannot be R, A, N, L, T, and also we know from guess1 and guess2 that R, A, N, L, T are absent).\n\nSo for C _ E _ S:\n- The second letter can be: any letter except R, A, N, L, T (and also not C, E, S because we are using them? But C and S are fixed at positions 1 and 5, but they can appear again? The feedback doesn\'t say anything about multiple occurrences, so we can\'t rule out duplicates. However, we haven\'t seen any duplicates so far.\n\nBut we must avoid the absent letters.\n\nPossible letters for the second position: any letter except R, A, N, L, T. Also, we haven\'t tested many vowels: O, U, I? Or consonants: B, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nBut we need to form a valid word.\n\nExamples: \n- ""CHESS"" — but that has two S\'s? And S is at the end? Our pattern is C _ E _ S, so the fourth position must be the last but one? So ""CHESS"" would be C H E S S -> but then the S at position 4 and 5? But we have S at position 5, so if we put S at position 4, that would be a problem? Actually, we don\'t know if S can be at position 4. The feedback for S in guess2 was a check at position 5, but we don\'t have information about position 4.\n\nBut wait: in guess2, we had ""celts"": C E L T S -> L and T were absent, and S was correct at position 5. So S is only at position 5? Or could it be elsewhere? The feedback doesn\'t say anything about S being elsewhere. But we don\'t have evidence of multiple S\'s.\n\nHowever, we must consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication so far.\n\nBut let\'s check the pattern: we have C _ E _ S. The second letter is unknown, and the fourth letter is unknown.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""CHESS"": C H E S S -> but then the fourth letter is S? And the fifth is S? That would be two S\'s. But we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s. Also, H is new.\n\nBut note: in guess2, we had S at position 5 and it was correct. If the word had an S at position 4, then in guess2 we would have had a minus for the S at position 5? Actually, no: because the feedback only marks the S at position 5 as correct. If there were an S at position 4, we wouldn\'t know because we didn\'t test position 4. But in the feedback for guess2, we only got one S marked (at position 5). So if the word had two S\'s, then when we guessed ""celts"", we only tested one S (at position 5) and got it correct. The other S (if at position 4) would not be reflected because we didn\'t guess an S at position 4. So it\'s possible.\n\nBut we must form a valid word.\n\nHowever, ""CHESS"" is not a common word? Actually, ""chess"" is a word (meaning a type of board or a game). But let\'s see if there are more common words.\n\nOther possibilities for C _ E _ S:\n- ""CHEFS"" — but that would be C H E F S. F is new. This is a valid word (as in ""chefs"").\n- ""CHEPS"" — C H E P S. Valid.\n- ""CHESS"" — as above.\n\nBut what about if E is in position 4? Then the word is C _ _ E S. The third letter is unknown.\n\nSo for C _ _ E S:\n- ""CUPES"" — not a common word? Actually, ""cupes"" is not standard.\n- ""COPES"" — C O P E S -> valid? ""COPES"" is a word (meaning: a type of tree or to cover with cups).\n- ""CIDES"" — not common.\n- ""CAVES"" — but A is absent.\n\nAlternatively, ""CUSES"" — but that would be C U S E S -> but then E is at position 4? And S at position 3 and 5? But we have S at position 5 fixed, so if we put S at position 3, that would be a duplicate? And position 4 is E? So ""CUSES"" is C U S E S -> positions: C(1), U(2), S(3), E(4), S(5). But we have S at position 5, and if we put S at position 3, that would be a duplicate S? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed.\n\nBut we must avoid A, R, N, L, T.\n\n""CUSES"" has U and S, E. But we have two S\'s? And S at position 3 and 5. But we are testing position 3 and 4 for E? Actually, in this word, E is at position 4.\n\nBut we don\'t know if E is at position 4 or 3. We only know it\'s not at 1,2,5.\n\nSo let\'s list possible words:\n\nOption 1: E at position 3: C _ E _ S\n- Possible: \n  - ""CHESS"" (H at 2, F at 4)\n  - ""CHEPS"" (H at 2, P at 4)\n  - ""CHEFS"" (H at 2, F at 4)\n  - ""CHEWY"" — but that ends with Y, not S? No, we need to end with S.\n\nOption 2: E at position 4: C _ _ E S\n- ""COPES"" (O at 2, P at 3, E at 4, S at 5) -> valid.\n- ""CIDES"" — not common.\n- ""CUSES"" (U at 2, S at 3, E at 4, S at 5) -> but that has two S\'s. Is that allowed? Yes, but we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s.\n\nBut we must avoid the absent letters. ""CUSES"" has U and S, E. S is already known to be in the word (at position 5), but if we put S at position 3, that\'s a duplicate. We don\'t know if duplicates are present.\n\nAlternatively, ""COPES"" is a valid word and uses O and P.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we are testing position 4 for E? In ""COPES"", E is at position 4.\n\nBut we don\'t know if E is at position 4 or 3. We have to choose a word that will help us distinguish.\n\nWe can also consider that we have two positions fixed: 1 and 5, and we know E is in 3 or 4. So we can try to test both possibilities? But we can only test one at a time.\n\nWe can choose a word that has E in position 3 and a new letter in position 4? Or vice versa.\n\nBut we also want to test other common letters.\n\nWe have many letters left to test: for example, we haven\'t tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe should try to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nBut we are constrained by the pattern: we have to put E in position 3 or 4, and the other two positions must be filled with letters not in the absent list.\n\nLet me try to form a word that tests E in position 3 and introduces two new letters for positions 2 and 4? Or vice versa.\n\nWe can try ""CHESS"": \n  - C H E S S -> but then we are putting E at position 3, and S at position 4 and 5? But position 5 is fixed as S, so if we put S at position 4, that\'s a duplicate. And H is new at position 2.\n\nBut we are testing H and F? Actually, ""CHESS"" tests H and F.\n\nBut we have two S\'s? And we are testing S at position 4? We don\'t know if S is duplicated.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""CHEFS"": C H E F S -> tests H and F, and E at position 3.\n\nBut we are avoiding R, A, N, L, T. So ""CHEFS"" is acceptable? But is ""CHEFS"" a word? It might be informal? Actually, ""chefs"" is not a standard word. The correct word might be ""CHEFS""? But let me think.\n\nActually, ""CHESS"" is a valid word (as in the game of chess). But it has two S\'s.\n\nAnother word: ""CHEPS"" (meaning: to make something happen) — C H E P S. This tests H and P.\n\nBut we have E at position 3.\n\nWe can also consider ""CHEWY"" — but that ends with Y, not S.\n\nHow about ""CHEVY""? No.\n\nSo for E at position 3: we have ""CHESS"", ""CHEPS"", ""CHEFS"", ""CHEW"" (but that\'s 4 letters, not 5). 5-letter words: ""CHEWY"" doesn\'t end with S.\n\n""CHIPS"" — but that ends with S? C H I P S -> but then E is not in the word? But we know E is in the word, so we must include E? Actually, we don\'t have to include E? But if we don\'t include E, we won\'t get information about its position. So we should include E.\n\nSo we must have E in the word.\n\nTherefore, for the pattern C _ _ _ S, with E in position 3: we have:\n\n- ""CHESS"": tests H and F (and duplicate S? but we don\'t know if duplicate is allowed)\n- ""CHEPS"": tests H and P\n- ""CHEFS"": tests H and F (again, duplicate S? but F is new)\n- ""CHEWY"": doesn\'t end with S.\n\nOr ""CUSES"": but that has two S\'s: C U S E S -> tests U and duplicate S.\n\nBut we don\'t know if duplicates are present. So we can try ""CHESS"" to test H and F, and also the duplicate S? But we are testing position 3 for E and position 4 for S? Actually, in ""CHESS"": \n  Position 1: C (fixed)\n  Position 2: H (new)\n  Position 3: E (we are testing if E is here)\n  Position 4: S (we are testing if S is at position 4? But we already know S is at position 5, so if we get a minus for S at position 4, that would be new information? But we are also testing E at position 3.\n\nBut we are using two S\'s. If the word has only one S, then we might get an x for the S at position 4? But we already know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 4 and it\'s not present, we get x. But if it is present, we get a minus? But we don\'t know if there is a duplicate.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word without duplicate letters to test more new letters.\n\nFor example, ""CHEPS"": C H E P S -> no duplicate, and tests H and P.\n\nSimilarly, ""CHEFS"": C H E F S -> tests H and F.\n\nBut ""CHEFS"" is not a common word? Actually, it might be considered informal? But let\'s see.\n\nAnother word: ""CHEVY"" — no.\n\n""CHIPS"": C H I P S -> but E is not in the word? So we wouldn\'t test E. But we know E is in the word, so we must include E. Therefore, we cannot use ""CHIPS"" because it doesn\'t have E.\n\nWe must have E in the word.\n\nSo for the pattern with E at position 4: C _ _ E S\n- ""COPES"": C O P E S -> tests O and P.\n- ""CIDES"": not common.\n- ""CUSES"": C U S E S -> tests U and duplicate S.\n\nBut ""CUSES"" has duplicate S, and we are testing S at position 3 and 5? But we already know position 5 is S, so if we put S at position 3, we might get:\n- If the word has S at position 3, we get a check? But we don\'t know.\n- If the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get a minus for S at position 3? And we also get an x for the S at position 4? Actually, we are testing two S\'s: one at position 3 and one at position 4. If the word has only one S (at position 5), then:\n  - Position 3: S -> we guess S, but the word has only one S, so we get a minus (because S is in the word but not at position 3). And position 4: S -> we have an S at position 4? But the word has only one S, so the S at position 4 would be an extra? Actually, no: if the word has only one S, then the S at position 3 (if present) would be a minus, and the S at position 4 would be x? Because the S is already accounted for at position 5? Actually, no: the feedback marks each letter individually. If the word has one S, and we guess two S\'s, then:\n  - The S at position 3: since the word has only one S and it\'s at position 5, we mark the S at position 3 as absent? Actually, no: the feedback marks based on the actual occurrences. Since the word has one S, and we have two S\'s in the guess, then:\n    - The S at position 3: because the word has only one S and it\'s at position 5, this S is not in the word? Actually, no: the word has one S, so the S at position 3 is not in the word? But wait, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, we get a minus. If it\'s not in the word at all, we get x. But we know the word has at least one S (at position 5). So if we put an extra S, it might be marked as present but wrong position? Or if the word has two S\'s, then it might be marked as present? But we don\'t know.\n\nThis is getting complicated. To avoid confusion, maybe we should avoid using duplicate letters for now? Because we don\'t know if duplicates are present.\n\nSo let\'s try to avoid duplicates.\n\nTherefore, for the pattern with E at position 4: C _ _ E S, we can try:\n\n- ""COPES"": C O P E S -> tests O and P.\n- ""CIVES"": not common.\n- ""CIDES"": not common.\n\nOr without duplicates: ""COPES"" is acceptable.\n\nFor the pattern with E at position 3: C _ E _ S, we can try:\n\n- ""CHEPS"": C H E P S -> tests H and P.\n- ""CHEFS"": C H E F S -> tests H and F.\n- ""CHEWY"": doesn\'t end with S.\n\nBut ""CHEWY"" is C H E W Y -> not ending with S.\n\nHow about ""CHEVY""? No.\n\n""CHIPS"" doesn\'t have E.\n\nSo we need a word that has E and ends with S, and has two new letters.\n\nList of possible words that fit the pattern and avoid forbidden letters:\n\nPattern: C _ _ _ S, with E in position 3 or 4, and without R, A, N, L, T.\n\nE at position 3:\n- ""CHESS"" (H, F) — but duplicate S? Actually, no duplicate: ""CHESS"" has one S? Wait, ""CHESS"" is C-H-E-S-S? That\'s two S\'s? Oh, it has two S\'s: positions 3 and 4 are S and S? Actually: \n  Position 1: C\n  Position 2: H\n  Position 3: E\n  Position 4: S\n  Position 5: S\n\nSo it has two S\'s. But we are testing E at position 3 and S at position 4? But we already know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 4, we might get:\n  - If the word has S at position 4, we get a check? But we don\'t know.\n  - If the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get a minus for position 4 S? Because the S is already accounted for at position 5? Actually, the feedback marks each letter individually. So if the word has only one S, then the S at position 4 would be marked as absent? But we already have a S at position 5, so the S at position 4 would be an extra? And if the word has only one S, then the S at position 4 would be x? Because the S is already used at position 5? Actually, no: the feedback doesn\'t consider duplicates? \n\nWait, the rules: each letter is marked independently. But if the word has only one S, and we guess two S\'s, then:\n  - The S at position 5: correct (check)\n  - The S at position 4: since the word has only one S and it\'s already used at position 5, the S at position 4 would be marked as absent? Actually, no: the feedback should mark it as absent because the S is not in the word? But we know the word has an S at position 5, so the S at position 4 would be an extra? And if the word has only one S, then the S at position 4 would be x? Because the S is already accounted for by the position 5 S? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t mark the S at position 4 as present? Because the S is already used? \n\nBut the rules: each letter is marked based on the actual occurrences. So if the word has one S, and we guess two S\'s, then:\n  - The S at position 5: correct (check)\n  - The S at position 4: since the word has only one S and it\'s already used at position 5, the S at position 4 would be marked as absent (x)? Because the S is not in the word? But wait, the word has one S, so the S at position 4 is not present? So we get x for that S.\n\nBut we are testing E at position 3? So we can get:\n  - If E is at position 3, we get a check? But we don\'t know if E is at position 3 or 4.\n  - If we get a minus for E, then E is not at position 3, so it must be at position 4.\n\nBut we are also testing H and the fourth letter S? But we are testing S at position 4? And if we get x for the S at position 4, then the word has only one S (at position 5) and E must be at position 4? Because we are testing E at position 3 and getting a minus? Then E must be at position 4? Because we know it\'s not at 1,2,5.\n\nBut wait, if we get a minus for E at position 3, then E is in the word but not at 3, so it must be at 4? But we are not sure if E is at 4? We are testing position 3.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to test E at position 4 without testing duplicate S? \n\nHow about ""COPES"": C O P E S -> tests O and P, and E at position 4.\n\nThis avoids duplicates and tests two new letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""CUSES"": tests U and duplicate S? But duplicate S: we are testing S at position 3 and 4? And we already know S is at position 5.\n\nBut to avoid complexity, let\'s try ""COPES"".\n\nBut wait: what if the word has E at position 3? Then ""COPES"" would not test position 3? Actually, we are testing E at position 4? \n\nIn ""COPES"": \n  Position 1: C (fixed)\n  Position 2: O (new)\n  Position 3: P (new)\n  Position 4: E (we are testing if E is at position 4)\n  Position 5: S (fixed)\n\nIf we get:\n  - If E is at position 4, we get a check? Or if it\'s at position 3, we get a minus? And then we know E is at position 3? But we are testing position 4.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has E at position 3 and tests two new letters? For example: ""CHEPS"" (C H E P S) -> tests H and P.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider: we have not tested position 2 and 3 (except that position 3 is not E? from guess1 we know position 3 is not E? Actually, guess1: E was at position 5 and marked as present but wrong position, so position 3 is still possible? And we haven\'t tested position 3 for E? We tested position 2 and 5? Only position 5 for E? Actually, we tested position 2 and 5? And position 3 and 4 are untested.\n\nBut in guess1, we had E at position 5 and got a minus? So E is in the word but not at 5. We haven\'t tested position 3 and 4 for E? So we can test E at position 3 in this guess.\n\nSo let\'s try to test E at position 3? Then we can see if it\'s correct.\n\nBut we are also testing other letters.\n\nWe have two fixed letters: C and S. And we know E is in the word.\n\nSo we can try:\n\nWord: ""CHESS"" — but duplicate S? And we are testing S at position 4? And E at position 3.\n\nBut let me see: if the word has E at position 3, then we get a check for E? And if we get a minus for E, then E is not at position 3, so it must be at position 4.\n\nAlso, we test H and the fourth letter S? But if the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get x for the S at position 4? And then we know the fourth letter is not S? And E must be at position 4? Because we have E present and not at 3? And we haven\'t tested position 4 for E? Actually, we haven\'t tested position 4 at all? Only position 5 (in guess1) and position 2 (in guess2) were tested? For E, we tested position 5 (guess1) and position 2 (guess2) and got minuses? So position 3 and 4 are untested for E.\n\nSo if we test E at position 3 (as in ""CHESS"") and we get a minus, then E is not at position 3, so it must be at position 4? And if we get a check, then E is at position 3.\n\nBut we are also testing the letter at position 4? In ""CHESS"", position 4 is S? But we are testing S at position 4? And if the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get x for the S at position 4? And then we know the fourth letter is not S? And E must be at position 4? Because we have E present and not at 3? But wait, if we get a minus for E at position 3, then E is not at position 3, so it must be at position 4? Because we know E is in the word and not at 1,2,5. So position 4 is the only possibility? But we are testing position 3 for E? And if we get a minus, then E is at position 4.\n\nBut we are also testing S at position 4? And if we get x for the S at position 4, then the word has only one S (at position 5). Then E must be at position 4? Because we have E present and not at 3? And we haven\'t tested position 4 for E? Actually, we haven\'t tested position 4? Only position 5 (guess1) and position 2 (guess2) were tested? So position 4 is unknown.\n\nSo if we guess ""CHESS"":\n  - If E is at position 3, we get a check for E? And if we get a minus for E, then E is not at position 3, so it must be at position 4? And then we know the fourth letter is S? But we are testing S at position 4? And if we get a minus for S at position 4, that would mean the word has only one S (at position 5) and E is at position 4? Then the word is C _ _ E S? But we have the fifth letter as S? So it would be C _ _ E S? But we have the fourth letter E? And fifth S? So the word is C ? ? E S.\n\nBut we don\'t know the second and third letters.\n\nBut we are testing H at position 2 and S at position 4? And if we get a minus for S at position 4, then the word has only one S (at position 5) and E at position 4? Then the word is C ? ? E S.\n\nBut we don\'t know the second and third letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t have duplicate S? \n\nHow about ""CHEPS"": C H E P S -> no duplicate. This tests H at position 2 and P at position 4.\n\nIf we get:\n  - If E is at position 3, we get a check? And if we get a minus for E, then E is not at position 3, so it must be at position 4? And then we know the fourth letter is not P? And we have the fifth as S? So the word is C ? ? E S? And we know the second letter is not H? And the third letter is not E? But we already know E is not at position 3? Because in guess1, E was at position 5 and got a minus? Meaning the E is present but not at 5? It doesn\'t say anything about position 3? So position 3 could have E? Actually, no: in guess1, we tested E at position 5 and got a minus? That means E is in the word but not at position 5? It doesn\'t tell us about position 3? We haven\'t tested position 3 for E? We tested position 2 and 5? So position 3 is unknown.\n\nSo if we guess ""CHEPS"":\n  - If E is at position 3, we get a check? Then we know E is at 3? And then we only need to find the second and third letters? But we don\'t know the third? And the fourth? But we are testing P at position 4? And H at position 2? And if we get checks for H and P? Then we have the word? But we don\'t know if E is at position 3? We are testing it.\n\nBut if E is not at position 3, then we get a minus for E? And then we know E must be at position 4? And then the word is C ? ? E S? And we have H at position 2? And P at position 4? But we don\'t know if H and P are in the word? \n\nBut we are testing two new letters: H and P.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""CHEFS"": but that might not be common.\n\nAnother word: ""CHEVY"" — no.\n\nHow about ""CHEWY""? No.\n\n""CHIPS"" doesn\'t have E.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""CHEPS"" or ""CHESS"". But ""CHESS"" has duplicate S? And we are testing S at position 4? Which might be a duplicate? \n\nBut we can try ""CHEPS"" to avoid duplicate.\n\nBut what about ""CHEFS""? It might be accepted? But let\'s see: ""chefs"" is not standard.\n\nAnother word: ""CHEVY"" — no.\n\n""CHINE"" — but has N? N is absent? So invalid.\n\n""CHIVES"" — not common.\n\n""CHOPS"" — but ends with S? C H O P S -> but then E is not in the word? But we know E is in the word, so we must include E? So we cannot use ""CHOPS"".\n\nWe must have E.\n\nSo how about ""CHEAP"" — but has A? A is absent.\n\n""CHEEK"" — has E at position 3? And K? But ends with K? Not S.\n\nWe need to end with S.\n\nSo words ending with S and having E at position 3: \n  - ""CHESS"" (if we allow duplicate S? But we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s)\n  - ""CHEPS"" (no duplicate)\n  - ""CHEFS"" (no duplicate, but ""chefs"" is not common)\n  - ""CHEWY"" (no S at the end)\n\nOr words with E at position 4: \n  - ""COPES"" (no duplicate)\n  - ""CUSES"" (duplicate S)\n  - ""CIVES"" (not common)\n  - ""CIDES"" (not common)\n\nSo ""COPES"" is a valid and common word? Actually, ""copes"" is a word (meaning: a type of tree or to cover with cups).\n\nBut we haven\'t tested O and P.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""CUSES"": but that has duplicate S? And we are testing S at position 3? And position 4 is E? So ""CUSES"": C U S E S -> tests U and duplicate S? And we know S is at position 5, so if we put S at position 3, we might get:\n  - If the word has S at position 3, we get a check? But we don\'t know.\n  - If the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get a minus for S at position 3? And then we know the word has only one S? And E must be at position 4? Then the word is C ? ? E S? And we have U at position 2? And the third letter is unknown? But we get feedback on U? And the third letter? \n\nBut we are testing U and the third letter? But we don\'t know if U is in the word.\n\nBut we are testing two new letters? And we are testing the position of E.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nGiven that we have only 4 guesses left, we want to maximize information.\n\nWe know the word is C _ _ _ S, and E is in position 3 or 4.\n\nWe can try to test both possibilities? But we can only test one at a time.\n\nWe can choose a word that has E in position 3 and tests two new letters? Or in position 4?\n\nBut we don\'t know which one? So we have to pick one.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have E? But we know E is in the word, so we should include E to get more information about its position? But we already know E is present? And we are testing position 3? Or 4?\n\nBut we have two positions: 2 and 3 (if E is at 3) or 2 and 4 (if E is at 4). But we don\'t know which one.\n\nSo we can try a word that has E at position 3 and tests two new letters? Then we can see if E is at position 3? If we get a check for E, then we know E is at 3? And if we get a minus, then E must be at position 4? Because we know it\'s not at 1,2,5? And we haven\'t tested position 4? But we are testing position 3.\n\nBut we are also testing the fourth letter? In ""CHEPS"", we are testing P at position 4? And E at position 3.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose ""COPES"", we are testing E at position 4? And P at position 3? And O at position 2.\n\nWhich one to choose?\n\nWe can also consider that we have not tested many vowels: O, U, I? So testing O or U might be good.\n\nBut we have to pick one.\n\nLet me list the possibilities:\n\nCase 1: E at position 3 -> word: C H E ? S (where ? is a letter not in {R, A, N, L, T, and not C, E, S? But C and S are fixed, so the second letter can be any new letter, and the fourth letter can be any new letter? But we must avoid R, A, N, L, T.\n\nSo for E at position 3: \n  - The fourth letter must be a letter not in the absent list? And not S? Because we are testing position 3 for E? And we are testing the fourth letter? \n\nPossible words: \n  - ""CHESS"" (H, F) -> but duplicate S? And F is new? And we are testing S at position 4? But we already know S is at position 5? So if we get a minus for S at position 4, then the word has only one S? And E must be at position 4? Then the word is C ? ? E S? And we have H at position 2? And the third letter is unknown? And F at position 4? Actually, ""CHESS"" is C H E S S -> so position 4 is S? And position 5 is S? So if we get a minus for the S at position 4? That would mean the word has only one S (at position 5) and E is at position 4? Then the word is C ? ? E S? And we have H at position 2? And the third letter is unknown? And we are testing F at position 3? \n\nBut ""CHESS"" is valid.\n\nBut we are using duplicate S? And we don\'t know if duplicate S is present.\n\nAnother word: ""CHEFS"" (C H E F S) -> tests H and F, and E at position 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""CHEPS"" (C H E P S) -> tests H and P.\n\nBut we don\'t know if H is in the word? We haven\'t tested H? So we can test H? And P? \n\nWe can also try a word that doesn\'t have H? For example, ""CHEFS"" or ""CHEPS"".\n\nBut let me see: we have to avoid L, T, R, A, N. So H is allowed.\n\nBut we have to consider: if we test E at position 3 and we get a check, then we know E is at 3? And then we only need to find the second and third letters? But we don\'t know the third? And the fourth? But we are testing F? Or P? Or H? \n\nBut if we get a minus for E at position 3, then E is not at 3? So it must be at 4? And then the word is C ? ? E S? And we have the second letter unknown? And the third letter unknown? And we have the fourth letter E? And fifth S.\n\nThen we can try to find words of the form C ? ? E S? With the second and third letters not in {R, A, N, L, T} and not C, E, S? But C and S are fixed? So the second and third letters can be any new letter? But we must avoid R, A, N, L, T.\n\nSo possible words: \n  - ""CHEPS"" (H, P)\n  - ""CHEFS"" (H, F)\n  - ""CHEWY"" — no, because doesn\'t end with S.\n  - ""CHEVY"" — no.\n  - ""CHESS"" (H, F) — but that has duplicate S? And we are testing S at position 4? And we get a minus for S at position 4? Then we know the word has only one S (at position 5) and E at position 4? Then the word is C ? ? E S? And we have H at position 2? And the third letter is unknown? And we have F at position 3? So ""CHESS"" would be the word? But we are guessing it? And if it\'s correct, we win? But if not, we get feedback.\n\nBut we are limited to 4 guesses? We are on guess 3.\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nAnother idea: we can try a word that doesn\'t have E? But we know E is in the word, so we should include E? Because we are trying to find its position? And we have two positions left? But we are testing position 3? Or 4? \n\nWe can also try to test position 4 for E? Without testing position 3? \n\nFor example, we can try ""COPES"": C O P E S -> tests O at position 2, P at position 3, and E at position 4.\n\nIf E is at position 4, we get a check for E? And if we get a minus for E, then E is not at position 4? So it must be at position 3? And then the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O at position 2? And P at position 3? And the fourth letter is unknown? \n\nBut we are testing O and P? And we get information about O and P.\n\nSimilarly, we can try ""COPES"" to test E at position 4? And we get:\n  - If E is at position 4, we get a check? Then we know E is at 4? And then we only need to find the second and third letters? But we don\'t know the third? And the fourth is E? Fifth is S? So the word is C ? ? E S? And we have O at 2? And P at 3? And the third letter is unknown? \n\nBut if we get a minus for E at position 4? Then E is not at 4? So it must be at 3? And then the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O at 2? And P at 3? And the fourth letter is unknown? \n\nBut we are testing O and P? And we get feedback on their presence.\n\nBut we have two good candidates: ""CHESS"" (with duplicate S) and ""CHEPS"" (with duplicate? No: ""CHEPS"" has H, E, P, S? No duplicate? ""CHEPS"" is C H E P S -> no duplicate.\n\n""CHEPS"" tests H and P? And E at position 3.\n\nBut we are testing the same thing: we are testing position 3 for E? And if we get a minus, then E is at position 4? And we know the fourth letter is not P? And we have H at position 2? But we don\'t know if H is in the word? \n\nBut we are testing two new letters? And we are testing the position of E.\n\nBut we can also try to test multiple new letters? \n\nAnother word: ""CUBES"" — but we have U? And B? But we haven\'t tested B? But we are avoiding R, A, N, L, T? So ""CUBES"" has U and B? And E at position 4? So that\'s acceptable? But we are testing U and B? And E at position 4.\n\nBut we don\'t know if U and B are in the word.\n\nWe can also try ""COPES"" to test E at position 4? And tests O and P? And we avoid duplicate? \n\nBut let me check: ""COPES"" is C O P E S? No duplicate? And tests O and P? \n\nBut we have to see if we can get more information.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 4? And tests two new vowels? Or consonants? \n\nHow about ""COPES"" and ""CHEPS"" are both good? \n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nLet me see the frequency of letters? We want to test common letters.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nCommon letters: O, P, H, D, M, etc.\n\nSo ""COPES"" tests O and P? And ""CHEPS"" tests H and P? \n\nBut we are testing H in both? And P in both? \n\nBut we can try ""COPES"" to test a vowel? \n\nBut we have two vowels left? We haven\'t tested O? Or U? \n\nWe can also try ""CUBES"": C U B E S -> tests U and B? And E at position 4.\n\nBut we are testing U and B? \n\nBut we have many letters to test? We can test multiple.\n\nBut we are constrained by the pattern.\n\nI think ""COPES"" is a good choice because it tests two common letters: O and P? And we avoid duplicates? \n\nBut let me see: if we guess ""COPES"", and the word is ""CHESS"", then we get:\n  - C: ✓\n  - O: x (if the word is ""CHESS"", which has no O? And no P? But ""CHESS"" has H and F? So O and P are absent? And E: we are testing E at position 4? But in ""CHESS"", E is at position 3? So we get a minus for E? Because E is in the word but not at position 4? And we know E is in the word? So we get a minus? And then we know E is at position 3? And the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O and P absent? Then we know the word must be C ? E ? S? And we have to try another.\n\nBut we are using one guess to test two new letters? And if we get minuses, we know E is at position 4? And the word is C ? ? E S? And we have two letters to try? \n\nBut we have 4 guesses left? We are on guess 3? So we can do that.\n\nBut we can also try to test E at position 4? And also test other common letters? \n\nHow about ""COPES"" tests O and P? And we get feedback on O and P.\n\nBut we can also try ""COPES"" to test E at position 4? And if E is not at position 4, then E must be at position 3? And the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O and P? Then we can try ""CHESS"" next? But that has duplicate S? \n\nBut we are testing O and P? And if we get minuses, we know E is at position 3? And the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O and P absent? Then we can try ""CHEFS"" or ""CHEPS"" next? \n\nBut we have many possibilities? \n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 4? And tests two new vowels? Or consonants? \n\nHow about ""COPES"" and ""CHEPS"" are both good? \n\nBut let me see the feedback we got: \n\nIn guess2, we had ""celts"": \n  C: ✓ (position 1)\n  E: - (position 2) -> so E is not at position 2? And we know E is in the word? So E is at 3 or 4? \n\nWe can try to test E at position 4? And also test O? \n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nI think ""COPES"" is a good choice because it tests two common letters: O and P? And we avoid duplicates? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""COPES"".\n\nBut let me confirm: \n  ""COPES"": C O P E S\n\nIf the word is ""CHESS"", then:\n  - C: ✓\n  - O: x (not in word)\n  - P: x (not in word)\n  - E: - (because E is at position 3, not 4? Because ""CHESS"" has E at position 3? So E is present but not at position 4? So we get a minus? And then we know E is at position 3? And the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O and P absent? Then we know the word must be C ? E ? S? And we have to try ""CHESS"" next? But then we use two guesses? \n\nBut we have 4 guesses left? We are on guess 3? So we can do that.\n\nBut we can also try to test multiple letters? \n\nAnother word: ""CUBES"" — but that has U and B? And E at position 4? \n\nBut we don\'t know if U and B are in the word.\n\nI think ""COPES"" is a good choice.\n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""COPES""? Then we get it right? \n\nOr if E is at position 3, and the word is ""CHESS"", then we get:\n\n  C: ✓\n  O: x\n  P: x\n  E: - (because E is at position 3, not 4)\n  S: ✓ (position 5)\n\nThen we know the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O and P absent? Then we try ""CHESS"" next? \n\nBut we are using two guesses? \n\nBut we can also try to test more new letters? \n\nHow about ""CUBES"": C U B E S -> tests U and B? \n\nBut we are testing U and B? \n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nI think ""COPES"" is a good choice because it tests two common letters.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""COPES"".\n\nBut let me see: we have not tested O, P, H, U, B, etc.\n\nAnother candidate: ""COPES"" is fine.\n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""COPES""? Then we win.\n\nOr if not, we get feedback.\n\nSo the next guess: ""COPES""\n\nBut note: we are testing position 4 for E? And we get feedback on O and P.\n\nSo let\'s write it.\n\nBut we must avoid L, T, R, A, N? ""COPES"" has O, P, E, S? And avoids R, A, N, L, T? Yes.\n\nSo <guess>copes</guess>\n\nBut let me double-check: \n  We know: \n    Position 1: C (fixed)\n    Position 5: S (fixed)\n    E is present, not at 2 or 5, so must be at 3 or 4? \n    We are testing position 4? \n    We are testing O at position 2? And P at position 3? \n\nIf we get:\n  - If E is at position 4, we get a check? Then we know E is at 4? And then the word is C O P E S? And we have the third letter? But we don\'t know? Actually, we are testing position 4 for E? And if we get a check, then E is at 4? Then the word is C O P E S? And we have the third letter? But we don\'t know? \n\nBut if we get a minus for E, then E is not at position 4? So it must be at position 3? And then the word is C ? E ? S? And we have O and P absent? Then the word must be C ? E ? S? And we have to try ""CHESS"" or ""CHEFS"" next? \n\nBut we have more guesses.\n\nSo it\'s acceptable.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""COPES"".\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that tests more common letters? \n\nHow about ""COPES"" uses O and P? O is a vowel? And P is a consonant? \n\nAnother word: ""COVES"" — but that has V? And E at position 4? But ""co ves"" is not a common word? \n\n""COVES"" is a word? Meaning: to cover with vesicles? But it\'s uncommon.\n\n""COVES"" is not standard.\n\n""COMES"" — not common.\n\nSo ""COPES"" is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""COPES"".\n\nBut note: we are testing position 4 for E? And we get feedback on O and P? \n\nWe can also consider ""CUBES"": C U B E S -> tests U and B? \n\nBut I think ""COPES"" is fine.\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.\n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""COPES""? Then we win.\n\nIf not, we get feedback.\n\nSo <guess>copes</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  \n  - C ✓ (position 1 correct)  \n  - R x (R not in word)  \n  - A x (A not in word)  \n  - N x (N not in word)  \n  - E - (E in word, not position 5)  \n\n- **Guess 2 (celts)**:  \n  - C ✓ (position 1 correct)  \n  - E - (E in word, not position 2)  \n  - L x (L not in word)  \n  - T x (T not in word)  \n  - S ✓ (position 5 correct)  \n\n### Deductions:\n1. **Fixed positions**:  \n   - Position 1: **C**  \n   - Position 5: **S**  \n   So the word pattern is: **C _ _ _ S**.  \n\n2. **E constraints**:  \n   - E is in the word but not at position 2 (from guess 2) or 5 (from guess 1).  \n   - **E must be at position 3 or 4**.  \n   - The word cannot contain R, A, N (from guess 1), L, T (from guess 2).  \n\n3. **Absent letters**:  \n   - R, A, N, L, T are confirmed absent.  \n\n4. **Etesting**:  \n   - We need to test if E is at position 3 or 4.  \n   - Testing position 3 for E (as in ""CHESS"" or ""CHEPS"") will clarify:  \n     - If E is ✓ at position 3, it\'s correct.  \n     - If E is -, it means E is at position 4 (since it can\'t be at 1, 2, or 5).  \n   - Testing position 4 for E (as in ""COPES"") will reveal:  \n     - If E is ✓ at position 4, it\'s correct.  \n     - If E is x, it means E is at position 3.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- **Test E in position 4** to resolve its location (since position 3 is riskier and we haven\'t tested position 4 for E).  \n- **Introduce new common letters** to maximize information:  \n  - Avoid R, A, N, L, T.  \n  - Prioritize high-frequency letters: **O, P, H, D, M, U**.  \n- **Avoid duplicates** for now?

We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

Guess 2: ""celts""
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- E: - (in word, wrong position) — note: this is the second time we see E is present but not at position 2.
- L: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)
- S: ✓ (correct position)

Guess 3: ""copes""
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- O: x (not in word)
- P: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position) — this is the third time we see E is present but not at position 3? Because in ""copes"", E is at position 4? And we got a minus? So E is not at position 4? Then where? Only position 3 remains? Because positions 1,2,5 are fixed? And we know E is in the word? So the only possibility is position 3? 

Wait, let me clarify:

The word is: position 1: C, position 5: S. So positions 2,3,4 are unknown? But we know E is in the word? And it's not at position 4 (from guess3) and not at position 2 or 5 (from guess1 and guess2). Therefore, the only position left for E is position 3? 

But we haven't tested position 3 for E? So how do we know E is at position 3? 

From the feedback of guess3: we guessed ""copes"" and got E at position 4 as a minus? That means E is in the word but not at position 4? And we already knew E is not at position 2 or 5? And position 1 is C? So the only position left is position 3? 

Therefore, E must be at position 3? 

So the word is: C E _ _ S? But wait, we have:
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: ? (unknown)
  Position 3: E (we now know E must be at position 3? Because we tested position 4 in guess3 and got a minus? And we already knew E is not at 2 or 5? And position 1 is C? So position 3 is the only possibility? 

But we haven't tested position 3 for E? How do we know? 
- The feedback for guess3: E at position 4 is marked as present but wrong position? That means E is in the word? But it doesn't tell us where? And we know E is not at position 4? So the only remaining position is position 3? 

Yes, that's correct? 

So the word is: C ? E ? S? But wait, position 3 is E? So the pattern is: C ? E ? S

But we have position 3 fixed as E? 

So the word is: C ? E ? S

Now, we need to fill positions 2 and 4? 

But we also know:
- The word does not contain: R, A, N, L, T, O, P (from the feedback of all guesses: R,A,N,L,T,O,P are absent).

So absent letters: R, A, N, L, T, O, P.

We must avoid these.

Also, we know E is at position 3? So the word is: C ? E ? S

Now, what can be in position 2 and 4? They must be letters not in the absent list? And we haven't tested many letters? 

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, L, T, S, O, P? So we should test new letters? 

Available letters: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

But we need to form a word: C ? E ? S

Possible words? 

We can try:
- ""CHESS"": C H E S S -> but that has duplicate S? And we are testing S at position 4? But we already know S is at position 5? So if we put S at position 4, we might get:
  - If the word has S at position 4? Then we get a check? But we don't know if there is a duplicate S? 
  - If the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get a minus for S at position 4? 
But we don't know if the word has duplicate S? 

But ""CHESS"" is a valid word? 

But we are testing H at position 2? And S at position 4? 

But we have to avoid O and P? Which we are? 

But let me see: if the word is ""CHESS"", then we would have:
  C: ✓
  H: ✓ (if H is at position 2? But we don't know? Actually, we are testing H at position 2? And if the word is ""CHESS"", then H is correct? And we have E at position 3? And S at position 4? And S at position 5? But we already know S is at position 5? So the S at position 4 is an extra? 

But we are testing:
  Position 2: H -> if ✓, then H is correct? 
  Position 3: E -> we know it must be E? Because we deduced E must be at position 3? 
  Position 4: S -> we are testing if S is at position 4? But we already know S is at position 5? So if we get a minus for S at position 4, then the word has only one S (at position 5)? And E must be at position 4? But wait, we are testing E at position 3? And if we get a minus for E, then E must be at position 4? 

But we are also testing the fourth letter S? And if we get a minus for S at position 4, then the word has only one S (at position 5) and E must be at position 4? Then the word is C ? E E S? But we have position 2 to fill? 

But we are testing H at position 2? And if H is correct? Then the word is C H E E S? And we have to find the third letter? But we haven't tested the third letter? 

Actually, if we get:
  - ✓ for H at position 2: then the word is C H E ? S? And we have the fourth letter to find? And we know E is at position 3? And the fourth letter is not S? Because we are testing S at position 4? And we got a minus? So the fourth letter is not S? And not in the absent list? 
  - But then what? We have the word: C H E ? S? And the fourth letter is not S? And not in the absent list? So it could be? 

But we are testing H at position 2? And if H is correct? Then we have the word? But we don't know the fourth letter? 

But if we get a minus for H at position 2, then H is not in the word? And the word is C ? E ? S? And we have the fourth letter to find? 

But we are testing H at position 2? And if H is absent? Then the word is C ? E ? S? And we have to find the second and fourth letters? 

But we are testing H at position 2? And if we get a minus for H, then H is not in the word? So the word is C ? E ? S? And H is absent? Then we can try other letters? 

But we are also testing the fourth letter? We are testing ? at position 4? 

But we don't know if the fourth letter is S? Or not? 

But we are testing S at position 4? And we got a minus? So the word has only one S (at position 5)? Because if it had two S's, then we would have gotten a check for the S at position 4? But we didn't? So the word has only one S? 

Therefore, the word is: C ? E ? S? And the fourth letter is not S? 

And the second letter is not H? Because we are testing H at position 2? And if H is absent? Then the second letter is not H? 

So the word is: C [not H, and not any absent letter] E [not S, and not absent] S? But we know the word has exactly one S? At position 5? So the fourth letter is not S? 

And the second letter is not H? 

So the word: C ? E ? S? With the second letter not H and not absent? And the fourth letter not S and not absent? 

And we have to find a valid English word? 

Possible words: 
  - ""CHEFS"": C H E F S -> but we are testing H at position 2? And if H is absent? Then the word is not ""CHEFS""? And we get feedback on F? 
  - ""CHESS"": C H E S S -> but that has duplicate S? And we are testing S at position 4? But if the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get a minus for S at position 4? And then we know the fourth letter is not S? So the word is C ? E ? S? And we have H at position 2? And the fourth letter is not S? And not absent? So it could be F? Then the word is C H E F S? 

But we are testing H at position 2? And if H is absent? Then the word is not ""CHESS""? 

But we don't know the fourth letter? 

Alternatively, we can try ""CHEWY""? But that doesn't end with S.

Or ""CHEVY""? No.

So the only common word that fits: C ? E ? S? With the second letter not H and not absent? And the fourth letter not S and not absent? 

And the word must be valid? 

Possible letters for position 2: any letter except R, A, N, L, T, O, P, and H? Because we are testing H at position 2? And if H is absent? Then the second letter is not H? 

And position 4: must be a letter not in {R, A, N, L, T, O, P, and also not S? Because we are testing S at position 4? And if we get a minus for S, then the fourth letter is not S? 

So what letters can we use? B, D, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

But we need a word: C ? E ? S

Examples:
  - ""CHEFS"": C H E F S -> H at position 2? And F at position 4? 
  - ""CHEPS"": C H E P S -> H at position 2? And P at position 4? But we got x for P in guess3? So P is absent? So ""CHEPS"" is invalid because P is absent? 
  - ""CHESS"": C H E S S -> H at position 2? And S at position 4? But we got x for P? But we don't know about H? And S is already known? 
  - ""CHEWY"": doesn't end with S.

  - ""CHEVY"": no.

  - ""CHEM S""? ""CHEMS"" is not a word.

  - ""CHEDS"": C H E D S -> tests H and D? And avoids absent letters? D is new? And we haven't tested D? 
  - ""CHEFS"": C H E F S -> tests H and F? 

But we haven't tested H? So we can test H? 

But we have to avoid O, P, etc.

So ""CHEFS"" is a valid word? And it tests H and F? 

But we are testing H at position 2? And if H is absent? Then the word is not ""CHEFS""? 

But we don't know the fourth letter? 

Another word: ""CHEWY"" doesn't end with S.

How about ""CHEVY""? No.

""CHIPS"" doesn't have E.

So the only common words that fit: 
  - ""CHEFS"": C H E F S
  - ""CHESS"": C H E S S (but duplicate S? And we are testing S at position 4? But we already know S is at position 5? So if we put S at position 4, we might get a minus? Meaning the word has only one S? And E must be at position 4? But wait, we are testing E at position 3? And if we get a minus for E, then E must be at position 4? 

But let me clarify: 
  - If the word is ""CHEFS"": then we have E at position 3? And S at position 4? And S at position 5? 
  - If the word is ""CHESS"": then E at position 3? And S at position 4? And S at position 5? 
  - If the word is ""CHEDS"": then E at position 3? And D at position 4? And S at position 5? 

But we don't know the fourth letter? 

So we can try ""CHEFS"" to test H and F? 

But we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try to test multiple new letters? 

But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""CHEFS"" because it tests H and F? 

But we have to avoid O, P, etc.

So I think ""CHEFS"" is a good choice? 

But let me see: if we guess ""CHEFS"", and the word is ""CHEFS"", we win? 

If not, we get feedback on H and F? 

But we have only two positions left? And we are testing both? 

But we can also try ""CHEDS"" to test D? 

But we don't know if D is in the word? 

We can also try ""CHEWY""? But doesn't end with S.

How about ""CHEVY""? No.

Another word: ""CHEAP"" — but A is absent? 

""CHIEF"" — but ends with F? Not S.

So the only common words that fit the pattern and avoid absent letters are:
  - ""CHEFS"": C H E F S
  - ""CHESS"": C H E S S
  - ""CHEDS"": C H E D S

But ""CHESS"" has duplicate S? And we are testing S at position 4? 

But we already know S is at position 5? So if we put S at position 4, we might get:
  - If the word has S at position 4? Then we get a check? But we don't know if there is a duplicate S? 
  - If the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get a minus for S at position 4? 

But we are also testing H at position 2? 

So we can try ""CHEFS"" to avoid duplicate? 

But ""CHEFS"" is a valid word? It means ""chefs"" (as in the culinary arts)? Or ""chefs"" as an adjective? 

But it's acceptable.

Alternatively, we can try ""CHEDS"": C H E D S -> tests H and D? And avoids absent letters? D is new? 

But we haven't tested D? 

But we are testing H at position 2? 

We can also try ""CHEWY""? But doesn't end with S.

How about ""CHEVY""? No.

I think ""CHEFS"" is a good choice? 

But we have to consider: if the word is ""CHEFS"", then we get:
  C: ✓
  H: ✓ (if H is at position 2? But we don't know? Actually, we are testing H at position 2? And if the word is ""CHEFS"", then H is correct? And E at position 3? And S at position 4? And S at position 5? 
  But we are testing S at position 4? And we get a minus? Because the word has only one S (at position 5)? So we get:
    Position 1: C ✓
    Position 2: H: if the word is ""CHEFS"", then H is ✓? But if the word is ""CHESS"", then H is ✓? 
  But if the word is ""CHESS"", then we have:
    C: ✓
    H: ✓ (if the word has H at position 2? But we don't know? Actually, we are testing H at position 2? And if the word is ""CHESS"", then H is correct? 
  Then position 3: E ✓ (because E is at position 3 in ""CHESS""? But in ""CHESS"", E is at position 3? So we get a check? 
  Position 4: S ✓? Because the word has S at position 4? 
  Position 5: S ✓? 
  But we are testing S at position 4? And we get a check? So we know the word is C H E S S? 

But we are testing H at position 2? And if H is correct? Then we have the word? 

But we don't know if H is in the word? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have H? 

But we don't know? 

Another word: ""CHEVY""? No.

How about ""CHEWY""? No.

""CHIPS"" doesn't have E.

So I think ""CHEFS"" is a valid choice? 

But we have to consider: we are testing H at position 2? And if H is absent? Then the word is not ""CHEFS""? And we get feedback that H is absent? Then we know the word must be ""CHESS"" or ""CHEDS""? 

But we are testing F? In ""CHEFS""? 

If we get a minus for H? Then H is absent? Then the word is not ""CHEFS""? Then it could be ""CHESS"" or ""CHEDS""? 

But we are testing F? In ""CHEFS""? 

If we get a minus for F? Then F is absent? Then the word is not ""CHEFS""? Then it could be ""CHESS"" (if the fourth letter is S) or ""CHEDS"" (if the fourth letter is D)? 

But we are testing H at position 2? And if H is absent? Then the word is not ""CHEFS""? 

But we don't know the fourth letter? 

So we can try ""CHEFS"" to test H and F? 

But we have to avoid O, P, etc.

So I think ""CHEFS"" is a good choice? 

But let me see: we have not tested many vowels? We have tested E? And O? But O is absent? 

We have not tested I? 

But we can try ""CHEFS"" and see? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 4? But we already know E is at position 3? So we don't need to test position 4 for E? We know E is in the word? And we have position 3 fixed? So we don't need to test position 4? 

But we are testing the fourth letter? 

In ""CHEFS"", we are testing:
  Position 2: H
  Position 3: E (we know it must be E? Because we deduced it? But we haven't tested position 3 for E? We tested position 5? And position 2 and 4 we tested E and got minuses? So position 3 is the only possibility? So we are testing H at position 2? And F at position 4? 

But we are testing H at position 2? And if H is correct? Then we have the word? 

But we don't know if H is in the word? 

So we can try ""CHEFS"".

But let me check: we have not tested H and F? 

So we can try ""CHEFS"".

But we have to make sure it's valid? 

Another word: ""CHEVY""? No.

""CHIEF"" — no.

I think ""CHEFS"" is a valid and common enough word? 

But we have to consider: what if the word is ""CHEWY""? But that doesn't end with S.

Or ""CHEVY""? No.

So I think ""CHEFS"" is acceptable.

But let me see: if the word is ""CHESS"", then we get:
  C: ✓
  H: ✓ (if H is at position 2? But we don't know? Actually, we are testing H at position 2? And if the word is ""CHESS"", then H is correct? And we have E at position 3? And S at position 4? And S at position 5? 
  But we are testing S at position 4? And we get a minus? Because the word has only one S (at position 5)? So we get:
    C: ✓
    H: ✓ (if the word has H at position 2? But we don't know? Actually, we are testing H at position 2? And if the word is ""CHESS"", then H is correct? 
    E: ✓ (because E is at position 3 in ""CHESS"")
    S: ✓ (position 5)
    S: ✓ (position 4) — but wait, the word ""CHESS"" has S at position 4? So we would get a check? 
  But we are testing S at position 4? And we get a check? So we know the word is C H E S S? 

But we are testing H at position 2? And if H is correct? Then we have the word? 

But we don't know if H is in the word? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have H? 

For example, ""CHEDS"": C H E D S -> tests H and D? 

But we haven't tested D? 

But we are testing H at position 2? 

We can also try ""CHEWY""? No.

How about ""CHEVY""? No.

Another word: ""CHEAP"" — A is absent.

""CHIPS"" — no E.

So I think ""CHEFS"" is acceptable.

But let me see: we have the feedback that in guess3, we got a minus for E at position 4? And we deduced E must be at position 3? 

But what if the word has E at position 3 and we get a check? Then we know E is at 3? And the word is C ? E ? S? And we have the fourth letter? 

But we are testing F at position 4? 

If we get a minus for F? Then F is absent? Then the word is not ""CHEFS""? Then it could be ""CHESS"" or ""CHEDS""? 

But we are testing H at position 2? 

So we can try ""CHEFS"".

But we have to avoid O, P? We are avoiding O and P? 

So I think ""CHEFS"" is a good guess.

But let me see: we have not tested many letters? We can test H and F? 

Alternatively, we can try ""CHEWY""? But no, because it doesn't end with S.

How about ""CHEVY""? No.

I think we should go with ""CHEFS"".

So the next guess: ""CHEFS""

But wait: what if the word is ""CHEWY""? But it doesn't end with S.

Or ""CHEVY""? No.

So I think ""CHEFS"" is a valid choice.

Therefore, we guess ""CHEFS"".

But let me confirm: 
  ""CHEFS"": C H E F S

If the word is ""CHEFS"", we win? 
If not, we get feedback on H and F? 

But we have only two positions? And we are testing both? 

But we have to make a guess.

So I'll go with ""CHEFS"".

But let me see: we have not tested B, D, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y? 

But we are testing H and F? 

We can also try ""CHEDS"" to test D? 

But F is more common? 

I think ""CHEFS"" is fine.

So <guess>chefs</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we have deduced the following:

- **Position 1**: **C** (confirmed in all guesses)
- **Position 5**: **S** (confirmed in Guess 2 and 3)
- **E** is in the word but not at positions 2, 4, or 5 (from Guess 1, Guess 2, and Guess 3). The only remaining position for **E** is **position 3**. Thus, the word pattern is: **C _ E _ S**.

- **Absent letters**: R, A, N, L, T (from Guess 1 and 2), O, P (from Guess 3). These cannot appear in the word.

- **Present letters**: **E** (at position 3), **C**, and **S** (at position 5). **C**, **S**, and **E** are confirmed in the word.

The word must be:  
  - **C** (position 1)  
  - **S** (position 5)  
  - **E** (position 3, as deduced)  
  - Two new letters for positions 2 and 4 (not in {R, A, N, L, T, O, P}).

### Deduced Pattern: **C _ E _ S**
- Position 2: Must be a letter not in the absent list and not **E** (since E is at position 3).  
- Position 4: Must be a letter not in the absent list and not **S** (since position 5 is S, and duplicates are possible but unconfirmed).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Test E in position 3** (though confirmed, we are using it to test other letters).  
- **Test new high-frequency letters** for positions 2 and 4: **H** and **F** (common consonants not yet tested).  
- **Avoid duplicates** for now? But **CHEFS** has no duplicates, and tests two new letters.

If ""CHEFS"" is correct, we win. If not, the feedback will clarify:
- If **H** is ✓ at position 2, then the word is **C H E _ S**, and we have **F** to test at position 4.
- If **H** is - or x, we learn **H** is absent, and **F** may be present or absent.

But **H** cannot be absent because it's deduced to be in the word? We are testing it.

<guess>chefs</guess>",chefs,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

Guess 2: ""celts""
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- E: - (in word, wrong position) — note: this is the second time we see E is present but not at position 2.
- L: x (not in word)
- T: x (not in word)
- S: ✓ (correct position)

Guess 3: ""copes""
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- O: x (not in word)
- P: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position) — this is the third time we see E is present but not at position 3? Because in ""copes"", E is at position 4? And we got a minus? So E is not at position 4? Then where? Only position 3 remains? Because positions 1,2,5 are fixed? And we know E is in the word? So the only possibility is position 3? 

Wait, let me clarify:

The word is: position 1: C, position 5: S. So positions 2,3,4 are unknown? But we know E is in the word? And it's not at position 4 (from guess3) and not at position 2 or 5 (from guess1 and guess2). Therefore, the only position left for E is position 3? 

But we haven't tested position 3 for E? So how do we know E is at position 3? 

From the feedback of guess3: we guessed ""copes"" and got E at position 4 as a minus? That means E is in the word but not at position 4? And we already knew E is not at position 2 or 5? And position 1 is C? So the only position left is position 3? 

Therefore, E must be at position 3? 

So the word is: C E _ _ S? But wait, we have:
  Position 1: C
  Position 2: ? (unknown)
  Position 3: E (we now know E must be at position 3? Because we tested position 4 in guess3 and got a minus? And we already knew E is not at 2 or 5? And position 1 is C? So position 3 is the only possibility? 

But we haven't tested position 3 for E? How do we know? 
- The feedback for guess3: E at position 4 is marked as present but wrong position? That means E is in the word? But it doesn't tell us where? And we know E is not at position 4? So the only remaining position is position 3? 

Yes, that's correct? 

So the word is: C ? E ? S? But wait, position 3 is E? So the pattern is: C ? E ? S

But we have position 3 fixed as E? 

So the word is: C ? E ? S

Now, we need to fill positions 2 and 4? 

But we also know:
- The word does not contain: R, A, N, L, T, O, P (from the feedback of all guesses: R,A,N,L,T,O,P are absent).

So absent letters: R, A, N, L, T, O, P.

We must avoid these.

Also, we know E is at position 3? So the word is: C ? E ? S

Now, what can be in position 2 and 4? They must be letters not in the absent list? And we haven't tested many letters? 

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, L, T, S, O, P? So we should test new letters? 

Available letters: B, D, G, H, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

But we need to form a word: C ? E ? S

Possible words? 

We can try:
- ""CHESS"": C H E S S -> but that has duplicate S? And we are testing S at position 4? But we already know S is at position 5? So if we put S at position 4, we might get:
  - If the word has S at position 4? Then we get a check? But we don't know if there is a duplicate S? 
  - If the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get a minus for S at position 4? 
But we don't know if the word has duplicate S? 

But ""CHESS"" is a valid word? 

But we are testing H at position 2? And S at position 4? 

But we have to avoid O and P? Which we are? 

But let me see: if the word is ""CHESS"", then we would have:
  C: ✓
  H: ✓ (if H is at position 2? But we don't know? Actually, we are testing H at position 2? And if the word is ""CHESS"", then H is correct? And we have E at position 3? And S at position 4? And S at position 5? But we already know S is at position 5? So the S at position 4 is an extra? 

But we are testing:
  Position 2: H -> if ✓, then H is correct? 
  Position 3: E -> we know it must be E? Because we deduced E must be at position 3? 
  Position 4: S -> we are testing if S is at position 4? But we already know S is at position 5? So if we get a minus for S at position 4, then the word has only one S (at position 5)? And E must be at position 4? But wait, we are testing E at position 3? And if we get a minus for E, then E must be at position 4? 

But we are also testing the fourth letter S? And if we get a minus for S at position 4, then the word has only one S (at position 5) and E must be at position 4? Then the word is C ? E E S? But we have position 2 to fill? 

But we are testing H at position 2? And if H is correct? Then the word is C H E E S? And we have to find the third letter? But we haven't tested the third letter? 

Actually, if we get:
  - ✓ for H at position 2: then the word is C H E ? S? And we have the fourth letter to find? And we know E is at position 3? And the fourth letter is not S? Because we are testing S at position 4? And we got a minus? So the fourth letter is not S? And not in the absent list? 
  - But then what? We have the word: C H E ? S? And the fourth letter is not S? And not in the absent list? So it could be? 

But we are testing H at position 2? And if H is correct? Then we have the word? But we don't know the fourth letter? 

But if we get a minus for H at position 2, then H is not in the word? And the word is C ? E ? S? And we have the fourth letter to find? 

But we are testing H at position 2? And if H is absent? Then the word is C ? E ? S? And we have to find the second and fourth letters? 

But we are testing H at position 2? And if we get a minus for H, then H is not in the word? So the word is C ? E ? S? And H is absent? Then we can try other letters? 

But we are also testing the fourth letter? We are testing ? at position 4? 

But we don't know if the fourth letter is S? Or not? 

But we are testing S at position 4? And we got a minus? So the word has only one S (at position 5)? Because if it had two S's, then we would have gotten a check for the S at position 4? But we didn't? So the word has only one S? 

Therefore, the word is: C ? E ? S? And the fourth letter is not S? 

And the second letter is not H? Because we are testing H at position 2? And if H is absent? Then the second letter is not H? 

So the word is: C [not H, and not any absent letter] E [not S, and not absent] S? But we know the word has exactly one S? At position 5? So the fourth letter is not S? 

And the second letter is not H? 

So the word: C ? E ? S? With the second letter not H and not absent? And the fourth letter not S and not absent? 

And we have to find a valid English word? 

Possible words: 
  - ""CHEFS"": C H E F S -> but we are testing H at position 2? And if H is absent? Then the word is not ""CHEFS""? And we get feedback on F? 
  - ""CHESS"": C H E S S -> but that has duplicate S? And we are testing S at position 4? But if the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get a minus for S at position 4? And then we know the fourth letter is not S? So the word is C ? E ? S? And we have H at position 2? And the fourth letter is not S? And not absent? So it could be F? Then the word is C H E F S? 

But we are testing H at position 2? And if H is absent? Then the word is not ""CHESS""? 

But we don't know the fourth letter? 

Alternatively, we can try ""CHEWY""? But that doesn't end with S.

Or ""CHEVY""? No.

So the only common word that fits: C ? E ? S? With the second letter not H and not absent? And the fourth letter not S and not absent? 

And the word must be valid? 

Possible letters for position 2: any letter except R, A, N, L, T, O, P, and H? Because we are testing H at position 2? And if H is absent? Then the second letter is not H? 

And position 4: must be a letter not in {R, A, N, L, T, O, P, and also not S? Because we are testing S at position 4? And if we get a minus for S, then the fourth letter is not S? 

So what letters can we use? B, D, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y, etc.

But we need a word: C ? E ? S

Examples:
  - ""CHEFS"": C H E F S -> H at position 2? And F at position 4? 
  - ""CHEPS"": C H E P S -> H at position 2? And P at position 4? But we got x for P in guess3? So P is absent? So ""CHEPS"" is invalid because P is absent? 
  - ""CHESS"": C H E S S -> H at position 2? And S at position 4? But we got x for P? But we don't know about H? And S is already known? 
  - ""CHEWY"": doesn't end with S.

  - ""CHEVY"": no.

  - ""CHEM S""? ""CHEMS"" is not a word.

  - ""CHEDS"": C H E D S -> tests H and D? And avoids absent letters? D is new? And we haven't tested D? 
  - ""CHEFS"": C H E F S -> tests H and F? 

But we haven't tested H? So we can test H? 

But we have to avoid O, P, etc.

So ""CHEFS"" is a valid word? And it tests H and F? 

But we are testing H at position 2? And if H is absent? Then the word is not ""CHEFS""? 

But we don't know the fourth letter? 

Another word: ""CHEWY"" doesn't end with S.

How about ""CHEVY""? No.

""CHIPS"" doesn't have E.

So the only common words that fit: 
  - ""CHEFS"": C H E F S
  - ""CHESS"": C H E S S (but duplicate S? And we are testing S at position 4? But we already know S is at position 5? So if we put S at position 4, we might get a minus? Meaning the word has only one S? And E must be at position 4? But wait, we are testing E at position 3? And if we get a minus for E, then E must be at position 4? 

But let me clarify: 
  - If the word is ""CHEFS"": then we have E at position 3? And S at position 4? And S at position 5? 
  - If the word is ""CHESS"": then E at position 3? And S at position 4? And S at position 5? 
  - If the word is ""CHEDS"": then E at position 3? And D at position 4? And S at position 5? 

But we don't know the fourth letter? 

So we can try ""CHEFS"" to test H and F? 

But we have to choose one.

Alternatively, we can try to test multiple new letters? 

But we are constrained by the pattern.

We can try ""CHEFS"" because it tests H and F? 

But we have to avoid O, P, etc.

So I think ""CHEFS"" is a good choice? 

But let me see: if we guess ""CHEFS"", and the word is ""CHEFS"", we win? 

If not, we get feedback on H and F? 

But we have only two positions left? And we are testing both? 

But we can also try ""CHEDS"" to test D? 

But we don't know if D is in the word? 

We can also try ""CHEWY""? But doesn't end with S.

How about ""CHEVY""? No.

Another word: ""CHEAP"" — but A is absent? 

""CHIEF"" — but ends with F? Not S.

So the only common words that fit the pattern and avoid absent letters are:
  - ""CHEFS"": C H E F S
  - ""CHESS"": C H E S S
  - ""CHEDS"": C H E D S

But ""CHESS"" has duplicate S? And we are testing S at position 4? 

But we already know S is at position 5? So if we put S at position 4, we might get:
  - If the word has S at position 4? Then we get a check? But we don't know if there is a duplicate S? 
  - If the word has only one S (at position 5), then we get a minus for S at position 4? 

But we are also testing H at position 2? 

So we can try ""CHEFS"" to avoid duplicate? 

But ""CHEFS"" is a valid word? It means ""chefs"" (as in the culinary arts)? Or ""chefs"" as an adjective? 

But it's acceptable.

Alternatively, we can try ""CHEDS"": C H E D S -> tests H and D? And avoids absent letters? D is new? 

But we haven't tested D? 

But we are testing H at position 2? 

We can also try ""CHEWY""? But doesn't end with S.

How about ""CHEVY""? No.

I think ""CHEFS"" is a good choice? 

But we have to consider: if the word is ""CHEFS"", then we get:
  C: ✓
  H: ✓ (if H is at position 2? But we don't know? Actually, we are testing H at position 2? And if the word is ""CHEFS"", then H is correct? And E at position 3? And S at position 4? And S at position 5? 
  But we are testing S at position 4? And we get a minus? Because the word has only one S (at position 5)? So we get:
    Position 1: C ✓
    Position 2: H: if the word is ""CHEFS"", then H is ✓? But if the word is ""CHESS"", then H is ✓? 
  But if the word is ""CHESS"", then we have:
    C: ✓
    H: ✓ (if the word has H at position 2? But we don't know? Actually, we are testing H at position 2? And if the word is ""CHESS"", then H is correct? 
  Then position 3: E ✓ (because E is at position 3 in ""CHESS""? But in ""CHESS"", E is at position 3? So we get a check? 
  Position 4: S ✓? Because the word has S at position 4? 
  Position 5: S ✓? 
  But we are testing S at position 4? And we get a check? So we know the word is C H E S S? 

But we are testing H at position 2? And if H is correct? Then we have the word? 

But we don't know if H is in the word? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have H? 

But we don't know? 

Another word: ""CHEVY""? No.

How about ""CHEWY""? No.

""CHIPS"" doesn't have E.

So I think ""CHEFS"" is a valid choice? 

But we have to consider: we are testing H at position 2? And if H is absent? Then the word is not ""CHEFS""? And we get feedback that H is absent? Then we know the word must be ""CHESS"" or ""CHEDS""? 

But we are testing F? In ""CHEFS""? 

If we get a minus for H? Then H is absent? Then the word is not ""CHEFS""? Then it could be ""CHESS"" or ""CHEDS""? 

But we are testing F? In ""CHEFS""? 

If we get a minus for F? Then F is absent? Then the word is not ""CHEFS""? Then it could be ""CHESS"" (if the fourth letter is S) or ""CHEDS"" (if the fourth letter is D)? 

But we are testing H at position 2? And if H is absent? Then the word is not ""CHEFS""? 

But we don't know the fourth letter? 

So we can try ""CHEFS"" to test H and F? 

But we have to avoid O, P, etc.

So I think ""CHEFS"" is a good choice? 

But let me see: we have not tested many vowels? We have tested E? And O? But O is absent? 

We have not tested I? 

But we can try ""CHEFS"" and see? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in position 4? But we already know E is at position 3? So we don't need to test position 4 for E? We know E is in the word? And we have position 3 fixed? So we don't need to test position 4? 

But we are testing the fourth letter? 

In ""CHEFS"", we are testing:
  Position 2: H
  Position 3: E (we know it must be E? Because we deduced it? But we haven't tested position 3 for E? We tested position 5? And position 2 and 4 we tested E and got minuses? So position 3 is the only possibility? So we are testing H at position 2? And F at position 4? 

But we are testing H at position 2? And if H is correct? Then we have the word? 

But we don't know if H is in the word? 

So we can try ""CHEFS"".

But let me check: we have not tested H and F? 

So we can try ""CHEFS"".

But we have to make sure it's valid? 

Another word: ""CHEVY""? No.

""CHIEF"" — no.

I think ""CHEFS"" is a valid and common enough word? 

But we have to consider: what if the word is ""CHEWY""? But that doesn't end with S.

Or ""CHEVY""? No.

So I think ""CHEFS"" is acceptable.

But let me see: if the word is ""CHESS"", then we get:
  C: ✓
  H: ✓ (if H is at position 2? But we don't know? Actually, we are testing H at position 2? And if the word is ""CHESS"", then H is correct? And we have E at position 3? And S at position 4? And S at position 5? 
  But we are testing S at position 4? And we get a minus? Because the word has only one S (at position 5)? So we get:
    C: ✓
    H: ✓ (if the word has H at position 2? But we don't know? Actually, we are testing H at position 2? And if the word is ""CHESS"", then H is correct? 
    E: ✓ (because E is at position 3 in ""CHESS"")
    S: ✓ (position 5)
    S: ✓ (position 4) — but wait, the word ""CHESS"" has S at position 4? So we would get a check? 
  But we are testing S at position 4? And we get a check? So we know the word is C H E S S? 

But we are testing H at position 2? And if H is correct? Then we have the word? 

But we don't know if H is in the word? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have H? 

For example, ""CHEDS"": C H E D S -> tests H and D? 

But we haven't tested D? 

But we are testing H at position 2? 

We can also try ""CHEWY""? No.

How about ""CHEVY""? No.

Another word: ""CHEAP"" — A is absent.

""CHIPS"" — no E.

So I think ""CHEFS"" is acceptable.

But let me see: we have the feedback that in guess3, we got a minus for E at position 4? And we deduced E must be at position 3? 

But what if the word has E at position 3 and we get a check? Then we know E is at 3? And the word is C ? E ? S? And we have the fourth letter? 

But we are testing F at position 4? 

If we get a minus for F? Then F is absent? Then the word is not ""CHEFS""? Then it could be ""CHESS"" or ""CHEDS""? 

But we are testing H at position 2? 

So we can try ""CHEFS"".

But we have to avoid O, P? We are avoiding O and P? 

So I think ""CHEFS"" is a good guess.

But let me see: we have not tested many letters? We can test H and F? 

Alternatively, we can try ""CHEWY""? But no, because it doesn't end with S.

How about ""CHEVY""? No.

I think we should go with ""CHEFS"".

So the next guess: ""CHEFS""

But wait: what if the word is ""CHEWY""? But it doesn't end with S.

Or ""CHEVY""? No.

So I think ""CHEFS"" is a valid choice.

Therefore, we guess ""CHEFS"".

But let me confirm: 
  ""CHEFS"": C H E F S

If the word is ""CHEFS"", we win? 
If not, we get feedback on H and F? 

But we have only two positions? And we are testing both? 

But we have to make a guess.

So I'll go with ""CHEFS"".

But let me see: we have not tested B, D, G, I, K, M, U, V, W, Y? 

But we are testing H and F? 

We can also try ""CHEDS"" to test D? 

But F is more common? 

I think ""CHEFS"" is fine.

So <guess>chefs</guess>Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we have deduced the following:

- **Position 1**: **C** (confirmed in all guesses)
- **Position 5**: **S** (confirmed in Guess 2 and 3)
- **E** is in the word but not at positions 2, 4, or 5 (from Guess 1, Guess 2, and Guess 3). The only remaining position for **E** is **position 3**. Thus, the word pattern is: **C _ E _ S**.

- **Absent letters**: R, A, N, L, T (from Guess 1 and 2), O, P (from Guess 3). These cannot appear in the word.

- **Present letters**: **E** (at position 3), **C**, and **S** (at position 5). **C**, **S**, and **E** are confirmed in the word.

The word must be:  
  - **C** (position 1)  
  - **S** (position 5)  
  - **E** (position 3, as deduced)  
  - Two new letters for positions 2 and 4 (not in {R, A, N, L, T, O, P}).

### Deduced Pattern: **C _ E _ S**
- Position 2: Must be a letter not in the absent list and not **E** (since E is at position 3).  
- Position 4: Must be a letter not in the absent list and not **S** (since position 5 is S, and duplicates are possible but unconfirmed).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- **Test E in position 3** (though confirmed, we are using it to test other letters).  
- **Test new high-frequency letters** for positions 2 and 4: **H** and **F** (common consonants not yet tested).  
- **Avoid duplicates** for now? But **CHEFS** has no duplicates, and tests two new letters.

If ""CHEFS"" is correct, we win. If not, the feedback will clarify:
- If **H** is ✓ at position 2, then the word is **C H E _ S**, and we have **F** to test at position 4.
- If **H** is - or x, we learn **H** is absent, and **F** may be present or absent.

But **H** cannot be absent because it's deduced to be in the word? We are testing it.",Guess 4: chefs -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) E(✓) F(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
