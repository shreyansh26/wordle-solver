We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
 R: x (R is not in the secret word)
 A: - (A is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
 N: x (N is not in the secret word)
 E: x (E is not in the secret word)

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters C and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, C was in position 1 and A in position 3 of ""crane"", but in the secret word, C is not at position 1 and A is not at position 3.
 - The letters R, N, and E are absent from the secret word.

 Therefore, the secret word has:
   - C and A as present letters, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively.
   - It does not contain R, N, E.

 We also know that the word is 5 letters long.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
   - Does not contain R, N, E (since they are absent).
   - Includes C and A, but in different positions than in ""crane"" (so C not at position 1, A not at position 3).
   - We can also try to include other common letters to get more information.

 Since C and A are in the word, we should try to place them in new positions.

 Let's think of a word that has:
   - C in a position other than 1 (so positions 2,3,4,5) but note that in the first guess, C was at position 1 and now we know it's not there. However, we don't know where it is, so we can try a different position.
   - A in a position other than 3 (so positions 1,2,4,5).

 Also, we should avoid using R, N, E.

 We can consider other common consonants and vowels. Since we have lost three vowels (A and E) and one consonant (R, N), we might need to use other vowels or common consonants.

 The word must have C and A. Let's try to think of words that have C and A, and avoid R, N, E.

 Possible words: 
   - We can try words with C and A, and also some other common letters.

 Since we have two known letters (C and A), we can try to use them in new positions and add new letters to test.

 Let's try to form a word that places C not at position 1 and A not at position 3.

 Example: 
   Position 1: cannot be C, and we don't know what it is. We can try a new letter for position 1.
   Position 2: we can put C? But note: in the first guess, C was at position 1 and now we know it's not at position 1, but it could be at position 2? However, we don't know yet.

 We can try to put C in position 2 and A in position 4? Or position 5? 

 Let's think of words that have C and A, without R, N, E.

 Some words: 
   - ""CLASP"": but note that C is at position 1 again? We cannot put C at position 1 because we know it's not at position 1. So we must avoid position 1 for C.

   - ""SCALP"": 
        S at position 1 (new), C at position 2 (which is new for C, since previously it was at 1), A at position 3? But wait, in the first guess A was at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not at position 3. However, the feedback for A in the first guess was that it is in the word but not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid that.

   Therefore, for ""SCALP"":
        Position 1: S (new)
        Position 2: C (new position for C, previously it was at 1 -> now 2)
        Position 3: A (but we know A is not at position 3, so this would be incorrect and we know it? But we want to use our knowledge to avoid wasting a position. So we shouldn't put A at position 3 again because we know it's not there).

   So let's avoid position 3 for A.

   How about ""PACT""? But that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

   Let's try ""PACTS"" but that's 5 letters? Actually, ""PACTS"" is 5 letters: P-A-C-T-S. 
        Position 1: P
        Position 2: A -> but we don't know if A can be at position 2? We only know it's not at position 3.
        Position 3: C -> but we know C is not at position 1, but position 3 is new for C? However, we don't know if C can be at position 3? The feedback for C was that it is in the word but not at position 1. So position 3 is still possible.

   But note: we also have to avoid R, N, E. ""PACTS"" doesn't have R, N, E. So that's okay.

   However, we have two known letters (C and A) and we are using them. But we are also introducing P, T, S.

   Alternatively, we can try ""SLATE"" but we know E is absent, so we cannot use E.

   Another word: ""TRACE"" -> but we know R and E are absent, so no.

   How about ""CLAMP""? 
        C at position 1 -> but we know C is not at position 1, so we cannot put C at position 1.

   We must avoid C at position 1 and A at position 3.

   Let's try ""SCAMP"":
        S at 1 (new)
        C at 2 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> this is acceptable because we are trying C in a new position (2)
        A at 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3, so we should avoid that.

   So we need to avoid putting A at position 3.

   How about ""MARCH""? But we know R is absent, so no.

   Another idea: ""PACKS"" -> 
        P at 1 (new)
        A at 2 (new position for A, previously at 3) -> this is acceptable because we are trying A in a new position (2)
        C at 3 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable because we are trying C at 3.
        K at 4 (new)
        S at 5 (new)

   But note: we are using C and A again, but in new positions. Also, we are introducing P, K, S.

   This seems like a good candidate.

   However, we must check if ""PACKS"" is a valid word? Yes, it is.

   But wait: we know that the secret word has C and A, but we don't know if they are in the positions we are trying? We are trying C at position 3 and A at position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses C and A in completely new positions.

   Another word: ""CACTI"" -> but that has two C's and we don't know if the secret word has two C's? Also, C at position 1? We cannot put C at position 1. So no.

   How about ""AUDIO""? But we know U? We don't, but we also know that E is absent and we have to avoid R, N. But ""AUDIO"" has no R, N, E. However, it has A at position 1 and C at position 4? 
        Position 1: A -> we don't know if A can be at position 1? We only know it's not at position 3. So it's acceptable.
        Position 4: C -> acceptable because previously C was at 1, so position 4 is new.

   But note: we are using A at position 1 and C at position 4. Also, we are introducing U, D, I, O.

   However, we have two known letters (A and C) and we are using them. But we are also testing new letters.

   But wait: we have only 6 tries, so we need to get as much information as possible.

   Alternatively, we can try to use a word that doesn't repeat the positions of C and A and also uses new letters.

   Another candidate: ""PACTS"" (as I thought earlier) but note:
        Position 1: P (new)
        Position 2: A (new position for A, previously at 3) -> acceptable.
        Position 3: C (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.
        Position 4: T (new)
        Position 5: S (new)

   This seems good.

   But let me check: we are using A at position 2 and C at position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

   We are also introducing P, T, S.

   Another candidate: ""TACIT"" -> 
        T at 1 (new)
        A at 2 (new position for A, previously at 3) -> acceptable.
        C at 3 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.
        I at 4 (new)
        T at 5 (new) -> but wait, we have two T's? Actually, ""TACIT"" has two T's? 
            T at 1 and 5? That's duplicate T. We don't know if the secret word has two T's? It might. But we are introducing T twice? That might not be efficient because we are using a duplicate letter when we could test two new letters.

   So ""PACTS"" is better because it has all distinct letters: P, A, C, T, S.

   But note: we have to avoid R, N, E. ""PACTS"" doesn't have R, N, E.

   So I think ""PACTS"" is a good second guess.

   However, let me double-check: 
        In the first guess, we had C at position 1 and A at position 3.
        Now in ""PACTS"", we have:
            P at 1 -> new
            A at 2 -> new position for A (previously at 3, so now at 2)
            C at 3 -> new position for C (previously at 1, so now at 3)
            T at 4 -> new
            S at 5 -> new

   This is good.

   But note: we are using A and C again, but that's okay because we are testing them in new positions.

   Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't include C and A? But we know they are in the word, so we should include them to get more information about their positions.

   So I will go with ""PACTS"".

   However, let me think of other words that might cover more vowels? We have lost A and E, so the word must have other vowels? Like I, O, U? 

   We have already tried A and E. So the remaining vowels are I, O, U. We haven't tested any of them.

   In ""PACTS"", we are testing I? No, we are testing S and T. But we are not testing I, O, U.

   Another word: ""CLOUD"" -> but C is at position 1? We cannot put C at position 1. So no.

   How about ""OASIS""? But it has two S's and we don't know if S is in the word. Also, C is missing? We must include C because we know it's in the word.

   We must include both C and A.

   Another word: ""MAGIC"" -> 
        M at 1 (new)
        A at 2 (new position for A, previously at 3) -> acceptable.
        G at 3 (new)
        I at 4 (new)
        C at 5 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.

   This is also a candidate.

   But note: we have two known letters (C and A) and we are using them. We are also testing M, G, I.

   Both ""PACTS"" and ""MAGIC"" are valid.

   However, ""MAGIC"" has C at position 5 and A at position 2. We know that in the secret word, C is not at position 1 and A is not at position 3. So positions 2 and 5 are new for A and C respectively? Actually, we are testing A at 2 and C at 5.

   But we also want to test more common letters. Let's see the frequency.

   We know the secret word has C and A. The word must also have three other letters that we haven't tried? We have eliminated R, N, E. So we have to choose from the remaining letters.

   We can try to cover more vowels? We haven't tested I, O, U. In ""PACTS"", we are not testing any new vowel. In ""MAGIC"", we are testing I.

   Alternatively, we can try ""PACKY"" (if we allow Y) but we don't know if Y is in the word.

   After considering, I think ""PACTS"" is a solid choice because it uses common consonants and we are testing A at 2 and C at 3, which are new positions.

   But note: we are using C at position 3 and A at position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

   Another word: ""SAUCE"" -> 
        S at 1 (new)
        A at 2 (new position for A, previously at 3) -> acceptable.
        U at 3 (new vowel)
        C at 4 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.
        E at 5 -> but we know E is absent! So we cannot use E.

   So ""SAUCE"" is invalid because it has E.

   Therefore, ""PACTS"" is good.

   Let me check if ""PACTS"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

   So I will go with ""PACTS"".

   But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know. But ""PACTS"" has no duplicates.

   Alternatively, we can try ""CLAMP"" but C at position 1 is not allowed.

   Another word: ""BACON"" -> but B at 1 (new), A at 2 (new position for A), C at 3 (new position for C), O at 4 (new vowel), N at 5 -> but N is absent! So we cannot use N.

   So ""BACON"" is invalid.

   Therefore, ""PACTS"" seems a good choice.

   But note: we are using C and A again. We are also testing P, T, S.

   We might also consider ""SCALP"", but in ""SCALP"":
        S at 1
        C at 2 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.
        A at 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3? Actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But in our guess, we are putting A at position 3? That would be inefficient because we know it's not at position 3. So we should avoid that.

   Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 3 and C at position 1.

   So ""SCALP"" is invalid because A is at position 3.

   How about ""PALMS""? 
        P at 1
        A at 2 (new position for A) -> acceptable.
        L at 3 (new)
        M at 4 (new)
        S at 5 (new)

   But we are missing C? We must include C because we know it's in the word. So we cannot leave out C.

   Therefore, we must have both C and A.

   Another word: ""MACHO"" -> 
        M at 1
        A at 2 (new position for A) -> acceptable.
        C at 3 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.
        H at 4 (new)
        O at 5 (new vowel)

   This word has both C and A, and avoids R, N, E.

   But note: we are testing O and H.

   How about ""PACKY""? 
        P at 1
        A at 2 (new for A) -> acceptable.
        C at 3 (new for C) -> acceptable.
        K at 4 (new)
        Y at 5 (new)

   This is also a candidate.

   But we have to choose one.

   Let's list the positions we are testing for C: 
        Previously C was at 1, now we are trying C at 2, 3, or 4? In ""PACTS"", we are trying C at 3. In ""MAGIC"", we are trying C at 3? Same in ""PACTS"". Actually, in ""PACTS"", C is at 3 and A at 2.

   We are testing C at 3 and A at 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are getting information.

   Alternatively, we can try to test C at a position we haven't tried. We only tried position 1 for C. So we can try position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

   Similarly, A was at position 3 and now we are trying at 2, 4, or 5.

   In ""PACTS"", we are testing A at 2 and C at 3.

   We might also consider ""CACTI"" but C at position 1 is not allowed.

   Another word: ""COAST"" -> 
        C at 1 -> not allowed (we know C is not at position 1).

   How about ""SCANT""? -> but N is absent, so no.

   After considering, I think ""PACTS"" is a good choice.

   But note: we are using C and A again. We are also testing P, T, S.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses C and A in completely new positions and also tests other vowels? We haven't tested I, O, U.

   How about ""AUDIO""? But we have to avoid E, R, N. ""AUDIO"" has A at 1, U at 2, D at 3, I at 4, O at 5. 
        But we are not including C? We must include C because we know it's in the word. So we cannot use ""AUDIO"" because it doesn't have C.

   Therefore, we must have C.

   Another word: ""FACET"" -> but E is absent, so no.

   How about ""BACCA"" -> duplicate C? And we don't know if duplicate letters are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, words can have duplicates. However, we don't have evidence for duplicates. Also, we are avoiding duplicate letters in our guess to maximize information.

   So ""PACTS"" is better because it has distinct letters.

   Let me choose ""PACTS"".

   If we get feedback for ""PACTS"", we can learn about the positions of C and A and also test P, T, S.

   So the second guess: ""PACTS""

   But note: we are using C and A again. We are also testing P, T, S.

   We might also consider ""SPACE"": 
        S at 1
        P at 2
        A at 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3! So we should avoid that.

   So no.

   Another word: ""PEACE"" -> has E and we know E is absent.

   How about ""PACIF"" -> not a word.

   So I think ""PACTS"" is a good choice.

   Therefore, I will guess ""PACTS"".

   But let me confirm: 
        We know the secret word has C (not at 1) and A (not at 3). 
        In ""PACTS"": 
            P: new
            A: at position 2 (which is new for A, so we can get feedback on A at 2)
            C: at position 3 (new for C, so we can test if C is at 3)
            T: new
            S: new

   This seems good.

   Alternatively, we can try ""SACRE"" -> but R is absent and E is absent.

   So I think ""PACTS"" is a good second guess.

   We'll go with ""PACTS"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as -)
- R, N, and E are not in the word (marked as x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked as -)

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Include C and A (since they are in the word), but avoid placing C at position 1 or A at position 3.
2. Exclude R, N, and E (since they are absent).
3. Test new letters to gather more information.

I chose ""pacts"" because:
- It places A at position 2 (a new position for A, avoiding position 3).
- It places C at position 3 (a new position for C, avoiding position 1).
- It introduces three new common consonants (P, T, S) to test their presence.
- It avoids R, N, E, and uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.

<guess>pacts</guess>",pacts,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
 R: x (R is not in the secret word)
 A: - (A is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
 N: x (N is not in the secret word)
 E: x (E is not in the secret word)

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters C and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, C was in position 1 and A in position 3 of ""crane"", but in the secret word, C is not at position 1 and A is not at position 3.
 - The letters R, N, and E are absent from the secret word.

 Therefore, the secret word has:
   - C and A as present letters, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively.
   - It does not contain R, N, E.

 We also know that the word is 5 letters long.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
   - Does not contain R, N, E (since they are absent).
   - Includes C and A, but in different positions than in ""crane"" (so C not at position 1, A not at position 3).
   - We can also try to include other common letters to get more information.

 Since C and A are in the word, we should try to place them in new positions.

 Let's think of a word that has:
   - C in a position other than 1 (so positions 2,3,4,5) but note that in the first guess, C was at position 1 and now we know it's not there. However, we don't know where it is, so we can try a different position.
   - A in a position other than 3 (so positions 1,2,4,5).

 Also, we should avoid using R, N, E.

 We can consider other common consonants and vowels. Since we have lost three vowels (A and E) and one consonant (R, N), we might need to use other vowels or common consonants.

 The word must have C and A. Let's try to think of words that have C and A, and avoid R, N, E.

 Possible words: 
   - We can try words with C and A, and also some other common letters.

 Since we have two known letters (C and A), we can try to use them in new positions and add new letters to test.

 Let's try to form a word that places C not at position 1 and A not at position 3.

 Example: 
   Position 1: cannot be C, and we don't know what it is. We can try a new letter for position 1.
   Position 2: we can put C? But note: in the first guess, C was at position 1 and now we know it's not at position 1, but it could be at position 2? However, we don't know yet.

 We can try to put C in position 2 and A in position 4? Or position 5? 

 Let's think of words that have C and A, without R, N, E.

 Some words: 
   - ""CLASP"": but note that C is at position 1 again? We cannot put C at position 1 because we know it's not at position 1. So we must avoid position 1 for C.

   - ""SCALP"": 
        S at position 1 (new), C at position 2 (which is new for C, since previously it was at 1), A at position 3? But wait, in the first guess A was at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not at position 3. However, the feedback for A in the first guess was that it is in the word but not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid that.

   Therefore, for ""SCALP"":
        Position 1: S (new)
        Position 2: C (new position for C, previously it was at 1 -> now 2)
        Position 3: A (but we know A is not at position 3, so this would be incorrect and we know it? But we want to use our knowledge to avoid wasting a position. So we shouldn't put A at position 3 again because we know it's not there).

   So let's avoid position 3 for A.

   How about ""PACT""? But that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

   Let's try ""PACTS"" but that's 5 letters? Actually, ""PACTS"" is 5 letters: P-A-C-T-S. 
        Position 1: P
        Position 2: A -> but we don't know if A can be at position 2? We only know it's not at position 3.
        Position 3: C -> but we know C is not at position 1, but position 3 is new for C? However, we don't know if C can be at position 3? The feedback for C was that it is in the word but not at position 1. So position 3 is still possible.

   But note: we also have to avoid R, N, E. ""PACTS"" doesn't have R, N, E. So that's okay.

   However, we have two known letters (C and A) and we are using them. But we are also introducing P, T, S.

   Alternatively, we can try ""SLATE"" but we know E is absent, so we cannot use E.

   Another word: ""TRACE"" -> but we know R and E are absent, so no.

   How about ""CLAMP""? 
        C at position 1 -> but we know C is not at position 1, so we cannot put C at position 1.

   We must avoid C at position 1 and A at position 3.

   Let's try ""SCAMP"":
        S at 1 (new)
        C at 2 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> this is acceptable because we are trying C in a new position (2)
        A at 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3, so we should avoid that.

   So we need to avoid putting A at position 3.

   How about ""MARCH""? But we know R is absent, so no.

   Another idea: ""PACKS"" -> 
        P at 1 (new)
        A at 2 (new position for A, previously at 3) -> this is acceptable because we are trying A in a new position (2)
        C at 3 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable because we are trying C at 3.
        K at 4 (new)
        S at 5 (new)

   But note: we are using C and A again, but in new positions. Also, we are introducing P, K, S.

   This seems like a good candidate.

   However, we must check if ""PACKS"" is a valid word? Yes, it is.

   But wait: we know that the secret word has C and A, but we don't know if they are in the positions we are trying? We are trying C at position 3 and A at position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses C and A in completely new positions.

   Another word: ""CACTI"" -> but that has two C's and we don't know if the secret word has two C's? Also, C at position 1? We cannot put C at position 1. So no.

   How about ""AUDIO""? But we know U? We don't, but we also know that E is absent and we have to avoid R, N. But ""AUDIO"" has no R, N, E. However, it has A at position 1 and C at position 4? 
        Position 1: A -> we don't know if A can be at position 1? We only know it's not at position 3. So it's acceptable.
        Position 4: C -> acceptable because previously C was at 1, so position 4 is new.

   But note: we are using A at position 1 and C at position 4. Also, we are introducing U, D, I, O.

   However, we have two known letters (A and C) and we are using them. But we are also testing new letters.

   But wait: we have only 6 tries, so we need to get as much information as possible.

   Alternatively, we can try to use a word that doesn't repeat the positions of C and A and also uses new letters.

   Another candidate: ""PACTS"" (as I thought earlier) but note:
        Position 1: P (new)
        Position 2: A (new position for A, previously at 3) -> acceptable.
        Position 3: C (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.
        Position 4: T (new)
        Position 5: S (new)

   This seems good.

   But let me check: we are using A at position 2 and C at position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

   We are also introducing P, T, S.

   Another candidate: ""TACIT"" -> 
        T at 1 (new)
        A at 2 (new position for A, previously at 3) -> acceptable.
        C at 3 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.
        I at 4 (new)
        T at 5 (new) -> but wait, we have two T's? Actually, ""TACIT"" has two T's? 
            T at 1 and 5? That's duplicate T. We don't know if the secret word has two T's? It might. But we are introducing T twice? That might not be efficient because we are using a duplicate letter when we could test two new letters.

   So ""PACTS"" is better because it has all distinct letters: P, A, C, T, S.

   But note: we have to avoid R, N, E. ""PACTS"" doesn't have R, N, E.

   So I think ""PACTS"" is a good second guess.

   However, let me double-check: 
        In the first guess, we had C at position 1 and A at position 3.
        Now in ""PACTS"", we have:
            P at 1 -> new
            A at 2 -> new position for A (previously at 3, so now at 2)
            C at 3 -> new position for C (previously at 1, so now at 3)
            T at 4 -> new
            S at 5 -> new

   This is good.

   But note: we are using A and C again, but that's okay because we are testing them in new positions.

   Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't include C and A? But we know they are in the word, so we should include them to get more information about their positions.

   So I will go with ""PACTS"".

   However, let me think of other words that might cover more vowels? We have lost A and E, so the word must have other vowels? Like I, O, U? 

   We have already tried A and E. So the remaining vowels are I, O, U. We haven't tested any of them.

   In ""PACTS"", we are testing I? No, we are testing S and T. But we are not testing I, O, U.

   Another word: ""CLOUD"" -> but C is at position 1? We cannot put C at position 1. So no.

   How about ""OASIS""? But it has two S's and we don't know if S is in the word. Also, C is missing? We must include C because we know it's in the word.

   We must include both C and A.

   Another word: ""MAGIC"" -> 
        M at 1 (new)
        A at 2 (new position for A, previously at 3) -> acceptable.
        G at 3 (new)
        I at 4 (new)
        C at 5 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.

   This is also a candidate.

   But note: we have two known letters (C and A) and we are using them. We are also testing M, G, I.

   Both ""PACTS"" and ""MAGIC"" are valid.

   However, ""MAGIC"" has C at position 5 and A at position 2. We know that in the secret word, C is not at position 1 and A is not at position 3. So positions 2 and 5 are new for A and C respectively? Actually, we are testing A at 2 and C at 5.

   But we also want to test more common letters. Let's see the frequency.

   We know the secret word has C and A. The word must also have three other letters that we haven't tried? We have eliminated R, N, E. So we have to choose from the remaining letters.

   We can try to cover more vowels? We haven't tested I, O, U. In ""PACTS"", we are not testing any new vowel. In ""MAGIC"", we are testing I.

   Alternatively, we can try ""PACKY"" (if we allow Y) but we don't know if Y is in the word.

   After considering, I think ""PACTS"" is a solid choice because it uses common consonants and we are testing A at 2 and C at 3, which are new positions.

   But note: we are using C at position 3 and A at position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

   Another word: ""SAUCE"" -> 
        S at 1 (new)
        A at 2 (new position for A, previously at 3) -> acceptable.
        U at 3 (new vowel)
        C at 4 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.
        E at 5 -> but we know E is absent! So we cannot use E.

   So ""SAUCE"" is invalid because it has E.

   Therefore, ""PACTS"" is good.

   Let me check if ""PACTS"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

   So I will go with ""PACTS"".

   But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know. But ""PACTS"" has no duplicates.

   Alternatively, we can try ""CLAMP"" but C at position 1 is not allowed.

   Another word: ""BACON"" -> but B at 1 (new), A at 2 (new position for A), C at 3 (new position for C), O at 4 (new vowel), N at 5 -> but N is absent! So we cannot use N.

   So ""BACON"" is invalid.

   Therefore, ""PACTS"" seems a good choice.

   But note: we are using C and A again. We are also testing P, T, S.

   We might also consider ""SCALP"", but in ""SCALP"":
        S at 1
        C at 2 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.
        A at 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3? Actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But in our guess, we are putting A at position 3? That would be inefficient because we know it's not at position 3. So we should avoid that.

   Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 3 and C at position 1.

   So ""SCALP"" is invalid because A is at position 3.

   How about ""PALMS""? 
        P at 1
        A at 2 (new position for A) -> acceptable.
        L at 3 (new)
        M at 4 (new)
        S at 5 (new)

   But we are missing C? We must include C because we know it's in the word. So we cannot leave out C.

   Therefore, we must have both C and A.

   Another word: ""MACHO"" -> 
        M at 1
        A at 2 (new position for A) -> acceptable.
        C at 3 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.
        H at 4 (new)
        O at 5 (new vowel)

   This word has both C and A, and avoids R, N, E.

   But note: we are testing O and H.

   How about ""PACKY""? 
        P at 1
        A at 2 (new for A) -> acceptable.
        C at 3 (new for C) -> acceptable.
        K at 4 (new)
        Y at 5 (new)

   This is also a candidate.

   But we have to choose one.

   Let's list the positions we are testing for C: 
        Previously C was at 1, now we are trying C at 2, 3, or 4? In ""PACTS"", we are trying C at 3. In ""MAGIC"", we are trying C at 3? Same in ""PACTS"". Actually, in ""PACTS"", C is at 3 and A at 2.

   We are testing C at 3 and A at 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are getting information.

   Alternatively, we can try to test C at a position we haven't tried. We only tried position 1 for C. So we can try position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

   Similarly, A was at position 3 and now we are trying at 2, 4, or 5.

   In ""PACTS"", we are testing A at 2 and C at 3.

   We might also consider ""CACTI"" but C at position 1 is not allowed.

   Another word: ""COAST"" -> 
        C at 1 -> not allowed (we know C is not at position 1).

   How about ""SCANT""? -> but N is absent, so no.

   After considering, I think ""PACTS"" is a good choice.

   But note: we are using C and A again. We are also testing P, T, S.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses C and A in completely new positions and also tests other vowels? We haven't tested I, O, U.

   How about ""AUDIO""? But we have to avoid E, R, N. ""AUDIO"" has A at 1, U at 2, D at 3, I at 4, O at 5. 
        But we are not including C? We must include C because we know it's in the word. So we cannot use ""AUDIO"" because it doesn't have C.

   Therefore, we must have C.

   Another word: ""FACET"" -> but E is absent, so no.

   How about ""BACCA"" -> duplicate C? And we don't know if duplicate letters are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, words can have duplicates. However, we don't have evidence for duplicates. Also, we are avoiding duplicate letters in our guess to maximize information.

   So ""PACTS"" is better because it has distinct letters.

   Let me choose ""PACTS"".

   If we get feedback for ""PACTS"", we can learn about the positions of C and A and also test P, T, S.

   So the second guess: ""PACTS""

   But note: we are using C and A again. We are also testing P, T, S.

   We might also consider ""SPACE"": 
        S at 1
        P at 2
        A at 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3! So we should avoid that.

   So no.

   Another word: ""PEACE"" -> has E and we know E is absent.

   How about ""PACIF"" -> not a word.

   So I think ""PACTS"" is a good choice.

   Therefore, I will guess ""PACTS"".

   But let me confirm: 
        We know the secret word has C (not at 1) and A (not at 3). 
        In ""PACTS"": 
            P: new
            A: at position 2 (which is new for A, so we can get feedback on A at 2)
            C: at position 3 (new for C, so we can test if C is at 3)
            T: new
            S: new

   This seems good.

   Alternatively, we can try ""SACRE"" -> but R is absent and E is absent.

   So I think ""PACTS"" is a good second guess.

   We'll go with ""PACTS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as -)
- R, N, and E are not in the word (marked as x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked as -)

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Include C and A (since they are in the word), but avoid placing C at position 1 or A at position 3.
2. Exclude R, N, and E (since they are absent).
3. Test new letters to gather more information.

I chose ""pacts"" because:
- It places A at position 2 (a new position for A, avoiding position 3).
- It places C at position 3 (a new position for C, avoiding position 1).
- It introduces three new common consonants (P, T, S) to test their presence.
- It avoids R, N, E, and uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.",Guess 2: pacts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) C(-) T(x) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
 R: x (R is not in the secret word)
 A: - (A is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
 N: x (N is not in the secret word)
 E: x (E is not in the secret word)

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters C and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, C was in position 1 and A in position 3 of ""crane"", but in the secret word, C is not at position 1 and A is not at position 3.
 - The letters R, N, and E are absent from the secret word.

 Therefore, the secret word has:
   - C and A as present letters, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively.
   - It does not contain R, N, E.

 We also know that the word is 5 letters long.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
   - Does not contain R, N, E (since they are absent).
   - Includes C and A, but in different positions than in ""crane"" (so C not at position 1, A not at position 3).
   - We can also try to include other common letters to get more information.

 Since C and A are in the word, we should try to place them in new positions.

 Let's think of a word that has:
   - C in a position other than 1 (so positions 2,3,4,5) but note that in the first guess, C was at position 1 and now we know it's not there. However, we don't know where it is, so we can try a different position.
   - A in a position other than 3 (so positions 1,2,4,5).

 Also, we should avoid using R, N, E.

 We can consider other common consonants and vowels. Since we have lost three vowels (A and E) and one consonant (R, N), we might need to use other vowels or common consonants.

 The word must have C and A. Let's try to think of words that have C and A, and avoid R, N, E.

 Possible words: 
   - We can try words with C and A, and also some other common letters.

 Since we have two known letters (C and A), we can try to use them in new positions and add new letters to test.

 Let's try to form a word that places C not at position 1 and A not at position 3.

 Example: 
   Position 1: cannot be C, and we don't know what it is. We can try a new letter for position 1.
   Position 2: we can put C? But note: in the first guess, C was at position 1 and now we know it's not at position 1, but it could be at position 2? However, we don't know yet.

 We can try to put C in position 2 and A in position 4? Or position 5? 

 Let's think of words that have C and A, without R, N, E.

 Some words: 
   - ""CLASP"": but note that C is at position 1 again? We cannot put C at position 1 because we know it's not at position 1. So we must avoid position 1 for C.

   - ""SCALP"": 
        S at position 1 (new), C at position 2 (which is new for C, since previously it was at 1), A at position 3? But wait, in the first guess A was at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not at position 3. However, the feedback for A in the first guess was that it is in the word but not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid that.

   Therefore, for ""SCALP"":
        Position 1: S (new)
        Position 2: C (new position for C, previously it was at 1 -> now 2)
        Position 3: A (but we know A is not at position 3, so this would be incorrect and we know it? But we want to use our knowledge to avoid wasting a position. So we shouldn't put A at position 3 again because we know it's not there).

   So let's avoid position 3 for A.

   How about ""PACT""? But that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

   Let's try ""PACTS"" but that's 5 letters? Actually, ""PACTS"" is 5 letters: P-A-C-T-S. 
        Position 1: P
        Position 2: A -> but we don't know if A can be at position 2? We only know it's not at position 3.
        Position 3: C -> but we know C is not at position 1, but position 3 is new for C? However, we don't know if C can be at position 3? The feedback for C was that it is in the word but not at position 1. So position 3 is still possible.

   But note: we also have to avoid R, N, E. ""PACTS"" doesn't have R, N, E. So that's okay.

   However, we have two known letters (C and A) and we are using them. But we are also introducing P, T, S.

   Alternatively, we can try ""SLATE"" but we know E is absent, so we cannot use E.

   Another word: ""TRACE"" -> but we know R and E are absent, so no.

   How about ""CLAMP""? 
        C at position 1 -> but we know C is not at position 1, so we cannot put C at position 1.

   We must avoid C at position 1 and A at position 3.

   Let's try ""SCAMP"":
        S at 1 (new)
        C at 2 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> this is acceptable because we are trying C in a new position (2)
        A at 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3, so we should avoid that.

   So we need to avoid putting A at position 3.

   How about ""MARCH""? But we know R is absent, so no.

   Another idea: ""PACKS"" -> 
        P at 1 (new)
        A at 2 (new position for A, previously at 3) -> this is acceptable because we are trying A in a new position (2)
        C at 3 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable because we are trying C at 3.
        K at 4 (new)
        S at 5 (new)

   But note: we are using C and A again, but in new positions. Also, we are introducing P, K, S.

   This seems like a good candidate.

   However, we must check if ""PACKS"" is a valid word? Yes, it is.

   But wait: we know that the secret word has C and A, but we don't know if they are in the positions we are trying? We are trying C at position 3 and A at position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses C and A in completely new positions.

   Another word: ""CACTI"" -> but that has two C's and we don't know if the secret word has two C's? Also, C at position 1? We cannot put C at position 1. So no.

   How about ""AUDIO""? But we know U? We don't, but we also know that E is absent and we have to avoid R, N. But ""AUDIO"" has no R, N, E. However, it has A at position 1 and C at position 4? 
        Position 1: A -> we don't know if A can be at position 1? We only know it's not at position 3. So it's acceptable.
        Position 4: C -> acceptable because previously C was at 1, so position 4 is new.

   But note: we are using A at position 1 and C at position 4. Also, we are introducing U, D, I, O.

   However, we have two known letters (A and C) and we are using them. But we are also testing new letters.

   But wait: we have only 6 tries, so we need to get as much information as possible.

   Alternatively, we can try to use a word that doesn't repeat the positions of C and A and also uses new letters.

   Another candidate: ""PACTS"" (as I thought earlier) but note:
        Position 1: P (new)
        Position 2: A (new position for A, previously at 3) -> acceptable.
        Position 3: C (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.
        Position 4: T (new)
        Position 5: S (new)

   This seems good.

   But let me check: we are using A at position 2 and C at position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

   We are also introducing P, T, S.

   Another candidate: ""TACIT"" -> 
        T at 1 (new)
        A at 2 (new position for A, previously at 3) -> acceptable.
        C at 3 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.
        I at 4 (new)
        T at 5 (new) -> but wait, we have two T's? Actually, ""TACIT"" has two T's? 
            T at 1 and 5? That's duplicate T. We don't know if the secret word has two T's? It might. But we are introducing T twice? That might not be efficient because we are using a duplicate letter when we could test two new letters.

   So ""PACTS"" is better because it has all distinct letters: P, A, C, T, S.

   But note: we have to avoid R, N, E. ""PACTS"" doesn't have R, N, E.

   So I think ""PACTS"" is a good second guess.

   However, let me double-check: 
        In the first guess, we had C at position 1 and A at position 3.
        Now in ""PACTS"", we have:
            P at 1 -> new
            A at 2 -> new position for A (previously at 3, so now at 2)
            C at 3 -> new position for C (previously at 1, so now at 3)
            T at 4 -> new
            S at 5 -> new

   This is good.

   But note: we are using A and C again, but that's okay because we are testing them in new positions.

   Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't include C and A? But we know they are in the word, so we should include them to get more information about their positions.

   So I will go with ""PACTS"".

   However, let me think of other words that might cover more vowels? We have lost A and E, so the word must have other vowels? Like I, O, U? 

   We have already tried A and E. So the remaining vowels are I, O, U. We haven't tested any of them.

   In ""PACTS"", we are testing I? No, we are testing S and T. But we are not testing I, O, U.

   Another word: ""CLOUD"" -> but C is at position 1? We cannot put C at position 1. So no.

   How about ""OASIS""? But it has two S's and we don't know if S is in the word. Also, C is missing? We must include C because we know it's in the word.

   We must include both C and A.

   Another word: ""MAGIC"" -> 
        M at 1 (new)
        A at 2 (new position for A, previously at 3) -> acceptable.
        G at 3 (new)
        I at 4 (new)
        C at 5 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.

   This is also a candidate.

   But note: we have two known letters (C and A) and we are using them. We are also testing M, G, I.

   Both ""PACTS"" and ""MAGIC"" are valid.

   However, ""MAGIC"" has C at position 5 and A at position 2. We know that in the secret word, C is not at position 1 and A is not at position 3. So positions 2 and 5 are new for A and C respectively? Actually, we are testing A at 2 and C at 5.

   But we also want to test more common letters. Let's see the frequency.

   We know the secret word has C and A. The word must also have three other letters that we haven't tried? We have eliminated R, N, E. So we have to choose from the remaining letters.

   We can try to cover more vowels? We haven't tested I, O, U. In ""PACTS"", we are not testing any new vowel. In ""MAGIC"", we are testing I.

   Alternatively, we can try ""PACKY"" (if we allow Y) but we don't know if Y is in the word.

   After considering, I think ""PACTS"" is a solid choice because it uses common consonants and we are testing A at 2 and C at 3, which are new positions.

   But note: we are using C at position 3 and A at position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

   Another word: ""SAUCE"" -> 
        S at 1 (new)
        A at 2 (new position for A, previously at 3) -> acceptable.
        U at 3 (new vowel)
        C at 4 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.
        E at 5 -> but we know E is absent! So we cannot use E.

   So ""SAUCE"" is invalid because it has E.

   Therefore, ""PACTS"" is good.

   Let me check if ""PACTS"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

   So I will go with ""PACTS"".

   But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know. But ""PACTS"" has no duplicates.

   Alternatively, we can try ""CLAMP"" but C at position 1 is not allowed.

   Another word: ""BACON"" -> but B at 1 (new), A at 2 (new position for A), C at 3 (new position for C), O at 4 (new vowel), N at 5 -> but N is absent! So we cannot use N.

   So ""BACON"" is invalid.

   Therefore, ""PACTS"" seems a good choice.

   But note: we are using C and A again. We are also testing P, T, S.

   We might also consider ""SCALP"", but in ""SCALP"":
        S at 1
        C at 2 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.
        A at 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3? Actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But in our guess, we are putting A at position 3? That would be inefficient because we know it's not at position 3. So we should avoid that.

   Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 3 and C at position 1.

   So ""SCALP"" is invalid because A is at position 3.

   How about ""PALMS""? 
        P at 1
        A at 2 (new position for A) -> acceptable.
        L at 3 (new)
        M at 4 (new)
        S at 5 (new)

   But we are missing C? We must include C because we know it's in the word. So we cannot leave out C.

   Therefore, we must have both C and A.

   Another word: ""MACHO"" -> 
        M at 1
        A at 2 (new position for A) -> acceptable.
        C at 3 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.
        H at 4 (new)
        O at 5 (new vowel)

   This word has both C and A, and avoids R, N, E.

   But note: we are testing O and H.

   How about ""PACKY""? 
        P at 1
        A at 2 (new for A) -> acceptable.
        C at 3 (new for C) -> acceptable.
        K at 4 (new)
        Y at 5 (new)

   This is also a candidate.

   But we have to choose one.

   Let's list the positions we are testing for C: 
        Previously C was at 1, now we are trying C at 2, 3, or 4? In ""PACTS"", we are trying C at 3. In ""MAGIC"", we are trying C at 3? Same in ""PACTS"". Actually, in ""PACTS"", C is at 3 and A at 2.

   We are testing C at 3 and A at 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are getting information.

   Alternatively, we can try to test C at a position we haven't tried. We only tried position 1 for C. So we can try position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

   Similarly, A was at position 3 and now we are trying at 2, 4, or 5.

   In ""PACTS"", we are testing A at 2 and C at 3.

   We might also consider ""CACTI"" but C at position 1 is not allowed.

   Another word: ""COAST"" -> 
        C at 1 -> not allowed (we know C is not at position 1).

   How about ""SCANT""? -> but N is absent, so no.

   After considering, I think ""PACTS"" is a good choice.

   But note: we are using C and A again. We are also testing P, T, S.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses C and A in completely new positions and also tests other vowels? We haven't tested I, O, U.

   How about ""AUDIO""? But we have to avoid E, R, N. ""AUDIO"" has A at 1, U at 2, D at 3, I at 4, O at 5. 
        But we are not including C? We must include C because we know it's in the word. So we cannot use ""AUDIO"" because it doesn't have C.

   Therefore, we must have C.

   Another word: ""FACET"" -> but E is absent, so no.

   How about ""BACCA"" -> duplicate C? And we don't know if duplicate letters are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, words can have duplicates. However, we don't have evidence for duplicates. Also, we are avoiding duplicate letters in our guess to maximize information.

   So ""PACTS"" is better because it has distinct letters.

   Let me choose ""PACTS"".

   If we get feedback for ""PACTS"", we can learn about the positions of C and A and also test P, T, S.

   So the second guess: ""PACTS""

   But note: we are using C and A again. We are also testing P, T, S.

   We might also consider ""SPACE"": 
        S at 1
        P at 2
        A at 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3! So we should avoid that.

   So no.

   Another word: ""PEACE"" -> has E and we know E is absent.

   How about ""PACIF"" -> not a word.

   So I think ""PACTS"" is a good choice.

   Therefore, I will guess ""PACTS"".

   But let me confirm: 
        We know the secret word has C (not at 1) and A (not at 3). 
        In ""PACTS"": 
            P: new
            A: at position 2 (which is new for A, so we can get feedback on A at 2)
            C: at position 3 (new for C, so we can test if C is at 3)
            T: new
            S: new

   This seems good.

   Alternatively, we can try ""SACRE"" -> but R is absent and E is absent.

   So I think ""PACTS"" is a good second guess.

   We'll go with ""PACTS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as -)
- R, N, and E are not in the word (marked as x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked as -)

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Include C and A (since they are in the word), but avoid placing C at position 1 or A at position 3.
2. Exclude R, N, and E (since they are absent).
3. Test new letters to gather more information.

I chose ""pacts"" because:
- It places A at position 2 (a new position for A, avoiding position 3).
- It places C at position 3 (a new position for C, avoiding position 1).
- It introduces three new common consonants (P, T, S) to test their presence.
- It avoids R, N, E, and uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.

But wait, in the first guess A was at position 3 and we got a \'-\' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it\'s not at position 3. However, the feedback for A in the first guess was that it is in the word but not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid that.\n\n   Therefore, for ""SCALP"":\n        Position 1: S (new)\n        Position 2: C (new position for C, previously it was at 1 -> now 2)\n        Position 3: A (but we know A is not at position 3, so this would be incorrect and we know it?

We only know it\'s not at position 3.\n        Position 3: C -> but we know C is not at position 1, but position 3 is new for C? However, we don\'t know if C can be at position 3? The feedback for C was that it is in the word but not at position 1. So position 3 is still possible.\n\n   But note: we also have to avoid R, N, E. ""PACTS"" doesn\'t have R, N, E.

So it\'s acceptable.\n        Position 4: C -> acceptable because previously C was at 1, so position 4 is new.\n\n   But note: we are using A at position 1 and C at position 4.

We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n   We are also introducing P, T, S.\n\n   Another candidate: ""TACIT"" -> \n        T at 1 (new)\n        A at 2 (new position for A, previously at 3) -> acceptable.\n        C at 3 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.\n        I at 4 (new)\n        T at 5 (new) -> but wait, we have two T\'s? Actually, ""TACIT"" has two T\'s? \n            T at 1 and 5? That\'s duplicate T. We don\'t know if the secret word has two T\'s? It might. But we are introducing T twice? That might not be efficient because we are using a duplicate letter when we could test two new letters.\n\n   So ""PACTS"" is better because it has all distinct letters: P, A, C, T, S.\n\n   But note: we have to avoid R, N, E. ""PACTS"" doesn\'t have R, N, E.\n\n   So I think ""PACTS"" is a good second guess.\n\n   However, let me double-check: \n        In the first guess, we had C at position 1 and A at position 3.\n        Now in ""PACTS"", we have:\n            P at 1 -> new\n            A at 2 -> new position for A (previously at 3, so now at 2)\n            C at 3 -> new position for C (previously at 1, so now at 3)\n            T at 4 -> new\n            S at 5 -> new\n\n   This is good.\n\n   But note: we are using A and C again, but that\'s okay because we are testing them in new positions.\n\n   Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn\'t include C and A? But we know they are in the word, so we should include them to get more information about their positions.\n\n   So I will go with ""PACTS"".\n\n   However, let me think of other words that might cover more vowels? We have lost A and E, so the word must have other vowels? Like I, O, U? \n\n   We have already tried A and E. So the remaining vowels are I, O, U. We haven\'t tested any of them.\n\n   In ""PACTS"", we are testing I? No, we are testing S and T. But we are not testing I, O, U.\n\n   Another word: ""CLOUD"" -> but C is at position 1? We cannot put C at position 1. So no.\n\n   How about ""OASIS""? But it has two S\'s and we don\'t know if S is in the word. Also, C is missing? We must include C because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n   We must include both C and A.\n\n   Another word: ""MAGIC"" -> \n        M at 1 (new)\n        A at 2 (new position for A, previously at 3) -> acceptable.\n        G at 3 (new)\n        I at 4 (new)\n        C at 5 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.\n\n   This is also a candidate.\n\n   But note: we have two known letters (C and A) and we are using them. We are also testing M, G, I.\n\n   Both ""PACTS"" and ""MAGIC"" are valid.\n\n   However, ""MAGIC"" has C at position 5 and A at position 2. We know that in the secret word, C is not at position 1 and A is not at position 3. So positions 2 and 5 are new for A and C respectively? Actually, we are testing A at 2 and C at 5.\n\n   But we also want to test more common letters. Let\'s see the frequency.\n\n   We know the secret word has C and A. The word must also have three other letters that we haven\'t tried? We have eliminated R, N, E. So we have to choose from the remaining letters.\n\n   We can try to cover more vowels? We haven\'t tested I, O, U. In ""PACTS"", we are not testing any new vowel. In ""MAGIC"", we are testing I.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try ""PACKY"" (if we allow Y) but we don\'t know if Y is in the word.\n\n   After considering, I think ""PACTS"" is a solid choice because it uses common consonants and we are testing A at 2 and C at 3, which are new positions.\n\n   But note: we are using C at position 3 and A at position 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n   Another word: ""SAUCE"" -> \n        S at 1 (new)\n        A at 2 (new position for A, previously at 3) -> acceptable.\n        U at 3 (new vowel)\n        C at 4 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.\n        E at 5 -> but we know E is absent! So we cannot use E.\n\n   So ""SAUCE"" is invalid because it has E.\n\n   Therefore, ""PACTS"" is good.\n\n   Let me check if ""PACTS"" is a valid word: yes, it is.\n\n   So I will go with ""PACTS"".\n\n   But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don\'t know. But ""PACTS"" has no duplicates.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try ""CLAMP"" but C at position 1 is not allowed.\n\n   Another word: ""BACON"" -> but B at 1 (new), A at 2 (new position for A), C at 3 (new position for C), O at 4 (new vowel), N at 5 -> but N is absent! So we cannot use N.\n\n   So ""BACON"" is invalid.\n\n   Therefore, ""PACTS"" seems a good choice.\n\n   But note: we are using C and A again. We are also testing P, T, S.\n\n   We might also consider ""SCALP"", but in ""SCALP"":\n        S at 1\n        C at 2 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.\n        A at 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3? Actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But in our guess, we are putting A at position 3? That would be inefficient because we know it\'s not at position 3. So we should avoid that.\n\n   Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 3 and C at position 1.\n\n   So ""SCALP"" is invalid because A is at position 3.\n\n   How about ""PALMS""? \n        P at 1\n        A at 2 (new position for A) -> acceptable.\n        L at 3 (new)\n        M at 4 (new)\n        S at 5 (new)\n\n   But we are missing C? We must include C because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot leave out C.\n\n   Therefore, we must have both C and A.\n\n   Another word: ""MACHO"" -> \n        M at 1\n        A at 2 (new position for A) -> acceptable.\n        C at 3 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.\n        H at 4 (new)\n        O at 5 (new vowel)\n\n   This word has both C and A, and avoids R, N, E.\n\n   But note: we are testing O and H.\n\n   How about ""PACKY""? \n        P at 1\n        A at 2 (new for A) -> acceptable.\n        C at 3 (new for C) -> acceptable.\n        K at 4 (new)\n        Y at 5 (new)\n\n   This is also a candidate.\n\n   But we have to choose one.\n\n   Let\'s list the positions we are testing for C: \n        Previously C was at 1, now we are trying C at 2, 3, or 4? In ""PACTS"", we are trying C at 3. In ""MAGIC"", we are trying C at 3? Same in ""PACTS"". Actually, in ""PACTS"", C is at 3 and A at 2.\n\n   We are testing C at 3 and A at 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are getting information.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to test C at a position we haven\'t tried. We only tried position 1 for C. So we can try position 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n   Similarly, A was at position 3 and now we are trying at 2, 4, or 5.\n\n   In ""PACTS"", we are testing A at 2 and C at 3.\n\n   We might also consider ""CACTI"" but C at position 1 is not allowed.\n\n   Another word: ""COAST"" -> \n        C at 1 -> not allowed (we know C is not at position 1).\n\n   How about ""SCANT""? -> but N is absent, so no.\n\n   After considering, I think ""PACTS"" is a good choice.\n\n   But note: we are using C and A again. We are also testing P, T, S.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses C and A in completely new positions and also tests other vowels? We haven\'t tested I, O, U.\n\n   How about ""AUDIO""? But we have to avoid E, R, N. ""AUDIO"" has A at 1, U at 2, D at 3, I at 4, O at 5. \n        But we are not including C? We must include C because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot use ""AUDIO"" because it doesn\'t have C.\n\n   Therefore, we must have C.\n\n   Another word: ""FACET"" -> but E is absent, so no.\n\n   How about ""BACCA"" -> duplicate C? And we don\'t know if duplicate letters are allowed? The rules don\'t say, but typically in Wordle, words can have duplicates. However, we don\'t have evidence for duplicates. Also, we are avoiding duplicate letters in our guess to maximize information.\n\n   So ""PACTS"" is better because it has distinct letters.\n\n   Let me choose ""PACTS"".\n\n   If we get feedback for ""PACTS"", we can learn about the positions of C and A and also test P, T, S.\n\n   So the second guess: ""PACTS""\n\n   But note: we are using C and A again. We are also testing P, T, S.\n\n   We might also consider ""SPACE"": \n        S at 1\n        P at 2\n        A at 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3! So we should avoid that.\n\n   So no.\n\n   Another word: ""PEACE"" -> has E and we know E is absent.\n\n   How about ""PACIF"" -> not a word.\n\n   So I think ""PACTS"" is a good choice.\n\n   Therefore, I will guess ""PACTS"".\n\n   But let me confirm: \n        We know the secret word has C (not at 1) and A (not at 3). \n        In ""PACTS"": \n            P: new\n            A: at position 2 (which is new for A, so we can get feedback on A at 2)\n            C: at position 3 (new for C, so we can test if C is at 3)\n            T: new\n            S: new\n\n   This seems good.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try ""SACRE"" -> but R is absent and E is absent.\n\n   So I think ""PACTS"" is a good second guess.\n\n   We\'ll go with ""PACTS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as -)\n- R, N, and E are not in the word (marked as x)\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked as -)\n\nFor the second guess, I need to:\n1. Include C and A (since they are in the word), but avoid placing C at position 1 or A at position 3.\n2. Exclude R, N, and E (since they are absent).\n3. Test new letters to gather more information.\n\nI chose ""pacts"" because:\n- It places A at position 2 (a new position for A, avoiding position 3).\n- It places C at position 3 (a new position for C, avoiding position 1).\n- It introduces three new common consonants (P, T, S) to test their presence.\n- It avoids R, N, E, and uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.\n\n<guess>pacts</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: pacts -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) C(-) T(x) S(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: - (in word, wrong position)
  R: x (not in word)
  A: - (in word, wrong position)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""pacts""
  P: x (not in word)
  A: - (in word, wrong position)
  C: - (in word, wrong position)
  T: x (not in word)
  S: ✓ (correct position)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The letter S is in the word and is at the 5th position (since in ""p acts"", S is the last letter and got a check).
2. The letters A and C are in the word, but:
   - In ""crane"", A was at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning it's not at 3, but now in ""p acts"", A is at position 2 and we got a '-' meaning it's not at 2? Actually, no: in ""p acts"", A is at position 2 and we got a '-', which means A is in the word but not at position 2. Similarly, in ""crane"", A was at position 3 and not at 3? Actually, we know from the first guess that A is not at position 3, and now we know also not at position 2.

3. Similarly, C:
   - In ""crane"", C was at position 1 and got a '-' meaning it's not at 1.
   - In ""p acts"", C was at position 3 and got a '-' meaning it's not at position 3.

4. We also know that the following letters are absent: R, N, E, P, T.

5. And S is present and at position 5.

So, the secret word has:
- S at position 5.
- C and A are present, but not at positions 1 (for C), 1 (for A), 3 (for C), or 3 (for A). So C cannot be at 1 or 3, and A cannot be at 1 or 3.

Also, we know the word has 5 letters, and we have two known letters (C and A) and one known letter (S at 5) and two unknown letters.

We need to form a word that:
- Has S at the end (position 5).
- Contains C and A, but C not at 1,2,3 and A not at 1,2,3.
- Does not contain R, N, E, P, T.

We also want to test new letters to find the remaining two.

Let's list the positions: 
Position 1: cannot be C (from first guess) and we know it's not P (from second guess). Also, it cannot be A? Actually, we don't know what position 1 is. It could be A? But wait, we know A is not at position 3 (from first guess) and not at position 2 (from second guess). So A cannot be at position 1 or 2? Actually, we only know it's not at 1 (from first guess) and not at 2 (from second guess). But it could be at position 3? We know from the first guess that position 3 is not A? Actually, the first guess had A at position 3 and got a '-', meaning A is in the word but not at position 3. So A cannot be at position 3. Similarly, from the second guess, A cannot be at position 2. Therefore, A must be at position 1 or 4? 

But wait, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

We know:
- Position 5: S
- Position 1: cannot be C (from first guess) and cannot be A? Actually, we don't know about A at position 1 from the second guess. We only know that A is not at position 2 (from second guess) and not at position 3 (from first guess). So A could be at position 1? But we have to consider that the first guess had A at position 3 and got a '-', meaning A is in the word but not at 3. That doesn't prevent A from being at position 1. However, in the second guess, we put A at position 2 and got a '-', meaning A is not at position 2. So A must be at position 1 or 4? 

But note: the first guess had A at position 3 and we got a '-', meaning A is in the word but not at 3. The second guess had A at position 2 and we got a '-', meaning A is in the word but not at 2. Therefore, A must be at position 1 or 4.

Similarly, for C:
- From first guess: C not at position 1.
- From second guess: C not at position 3.
- So C must be at position 2 or 4? Because position 1 is not allowed and position 3 is not allowed.

But note: the word has 5 positions. So C can be at 2, 4, or 5? But position 5 is S, so C cannot be at 5. Therefore, C must be at position 2 or 4.

However, we have two letters (A and C) that must be placed at positions 1,2,3,4, but with constraints:
- A: must be at 1 or 4 (since not at 2 or 3)
- C: must be at 2 or 4 (since not at 1 or 3)

But wait, position 4 could be either A or C? But we don't know which.

Also, we have two more letters to find? Actually, the word has 5 letters: we know S at 5, and then we have two more letters to find? Or actually, the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

So the secret word has:
  Position 5: S
  Position 1: must be a letter that is not R, N, E, P, T, and also not A? Because if A were at position 1, then in the second guess we had A at position 2 and got a '-' meaning A is in the word but not at 2. But that doesn't prevent A from being at position 1. Actually, we don't have any feedback that says A cannot be at position 1. The feedback for A in the first guess was that it is in the word but not at position 3. The second guess told us it is not at position 2. So it must be at position 1 or 4.

Similarly, C: must be at position 2 or 4.

But note: if A is at position 1, then C cannot be at position 1? But we don't have any duplicate letter constraint. However, we don't know if the word has duplicates. But we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so far.

So let's assume no duplicates for now.

Therefore, the possibilities:

Position 1: can be A? or a new letter? But we know A must be at 1 or 4. So position 1 is either A or a new letter.

Similarly, position 2: can be C? or a new letter? But C must be at 2 or 4. So if position 1 is A, then position 2 must be C? But we don't know for sure. We have to consider both.

Actually, we have two known letters (A and C) that must be placed in positions 1,2,3,4, but with constraints. And we have two more letters to find.

But note: position 3 is open and must be a letter that is not R, N, E, P, T, and also not A? Because if A is at 1, then position 3 must be a new letter. Similarly, if C is at 2, then position 3 must be a new letter (because C is at 2) and so on.

So the word must be:

  Position 1: either A or a new letter? But we know A must be at 1 or 4. So let's consider two cases:

Case 1: A at position 1.
  Then position 2: must be C? (because C must be at 2 or 4, and if A is at 1, then position 2 must be C to satisfy C's position? But wait, we don't know for sure. We have to test).

Case 2: A at position 4.
  Then position 1: must be a new letter (because A is at 4) and position 2: must be a new letter (because C must be at 2 or 4, and if A is at 4, then C must be at 2).

But we don't know which case. We have to choose a word that fits.

We also know that the word must have exactly 5 letters, without R, N, E, P, T.

So let's try to form words for both cases.

First, Case 1: A at position 1.

Then the word so far: A _ _ _ S

And C must be at position 2 or 4.

If C is at position 2: then A C _ _ S

What can be at positions 3 and 4? Two new letters, avoiding R,N,E,P,T.

So word: A C ? ? S

Possible words: 
  - ""ACIDS"": but we know I? We don't, but we haven't eliminated I. However, we have to avoid E? ""ACIDS"" has no E, R, N, P, T. But note: we don't know if I is in the word. Also, D is new.

But we have to check if ""ACIDS"" is a word? Yes.

But we also have to consider: in the first guess, we had C at position 1 (which was wrong) and now we are putting C at position 2. That's acceptable.

Similarly, A at position 1: acceptable? But we don't have any feedback that says A is at position 1. We only know it's at 1 or 4. So we are testing A at position 1.

But note: in the second guess, we had A at position 2 and got a '-', meaning A is not at 2. So if we put A at position 1, that's a new position.

But we must also consider: what if the word has duplicate letters? We don't have any indication. So let's assume no duplicates.

Second case: A at position 4.

Then the word: _ _ _ A S

And C must be at position 2 or 4? But position 4 is A, so C must be at position 2? Because if C were at position 4, then we have A at 4 and C at 4? That's impossible. So C must be at position 2.

So the word: _ C _ A S

Now, position 1 and 3: two new letters, avoiding R,N,E,P,T.

So words: 
  - ""SCA?S"" -> but we have S at the end? Actually, the word is _ C _ A S.

Possible words: 
  - ""OCEAN"" -> but E and N are absent? No, E and N are absent. So no.
  - ""LOCAL"" -> but L at 1, O at 2? But we are putting C at 2? No, in this case we are putting C at 2? Actually, in the second case, we are putting C at 2 and A at 4.

But wait, we are considering A at position 4, then C at position 2. So the word: ? C ? A S

So the third position must be filled. Words: 
  - ""SCUBA""? -> but U and B? And ""SCUBA"" is 5 letters? S-C-U-B-A. But we have A at position 5? No, we have A at position 4 and S at 5. So the word is _ C _ A S.

So the third letter is between C and A. Possible words: 
  - ""OASIS"" -> but O at 1, A at 2? But we are putting A at 4? So no. 
  - ""ICILY"" -> but I at 1, C at 2, I at 3, L at 4, Y at 5? But we need A at 4 and S at 5. So no.

We need the word to end with A S? Actually, the word is _ C _ A S.

So the third letter is the one before A. So the word ends with ""AS"".

What words end with ""AS""? 
  - ""LOCAL"" -> L-O-C-A-L? But that's 5 letters: positions 1:L, 2:O, 3:C, 4:A, 5:L? But then C is at position 3? But we know C cannot be at position 3 (from first guess). So no.

  - ""FOCAL"" -> F-O-C-A-L: again, C is at position 3? Not allowed.

  - ""DOCKS"" -> D-O-C-K-S: but C is at position 3? Not allowed.

  - ""BLOCK"" -> B-L-O-C-K: but C is at position 4? Then the word would be: B L O C K -> but we need A at position 4? No, we have A at position 4? Actually, in this pattern, we have A at 4 and S at 5. So the word must end with ""AS"". 

  Words ending with ""AS"": 
    - ""LOCAL"" -> invalid because C is at 3.
    - ""FOCAL"" -> same, C at 3.
    - ""DOCKS"" -> C at 3? Actually, ""DOCKS"" is D-O-C-K-S, so C is at 3 -> invalid.

  What about ""SCABS""? -> S-C-A-B-S: but we have S at position 1 and 5? Duplicate S? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, A is at position 3? But we know A cannot be at position 3 (from first guess). So no.

  How about ""OCEAN""? -> invalid because of E and N.

  Another: ""ACIDS"" -> A-C-I-D-S: 
        A at 1 -> acceptable? We are testing A at 1.
        C at 2 -> acceptable? We are testing C at 2.
        Then I at 3, D at 4, S at 5.

        But we know C cannot be at position 1 (which is satisfied) and A cannot be at 2 (satisfied) and we are putting A at 1 and C at 2. Also, we are testing I and D.

        This word: ""ACIDS"" is valid.

But note: we are using C and A again, but we are placing them in positions we haven't tried before? Actually, for A: we tried position 3 (in crane) and position 2 (in pacts). Now we are trying position 1. For C: we tried position 1 (in crane) and position 3 (in p acts). Now we are trying position 2.

So ""ACIDS"" is a candidate.

But we have to check if it meets the constraints:
- A at 1: we haven't tested A at 1 before? Actually, we haven't tested A at 1. We tested A at 3 (crane) and A at 2 (p acts). So position 1 is new for A.
- C at 2: we haven't tested C at 2. Previously C was at 1 (crane) and at 3 (p acts). So position 2 is new for C.
- Avoids R,N,E,P,T: yes.

But wait, we have S at position 5? Yes.

So ""ACIDS"" is a candidate.

But we also have the constraint that C cannot be at position 3? In ""ACIDS"", C is at 2, which is allowed.

Now, the other case: A at position 4.

Then the word: _ _ _ A S

And C must be at position 2? Because if C were at position 4, then position 4 is C and A is at 4? That would be the same letter? But no, we are putting A at 4 and C at 2? So the word: _ C _ A S

So we need a word of the form: ? C ? A S

What words? 
  - ""SCRAM"" -> but R is absent and we have S at the end? Actually, ""SCRAM"" ends with M? No.

  - ""SCALP"" -> but we have L at 3? And P is absent? We know P is absent. So no.

  - ""SCAMS"" -> ends with S? But we have S at the end? Actually, ""SCAMS"" ends with S? S-C-A-M-S -> but then we have two S's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, A is at position 3? But we know A cannot be at position 3. So no.

  - ""SCANT"" -> but N is absent.

  - ""SCARF"" -> R and F? R is absent.

  - ""SCABS"" -> S-C-A-B-S: A is at position 3? Not allowed.

  - ""SCADS"" -> S-C-A-D-S: A at 3? Not allowed.

  - ""SCOFF"" -> but O at 3? And F at 4? But we need A at 4? So no.

  - ""SCOWL"" -> S-C-O-W-L: but we need A at 4? No.

  - ""SCUBA"" -> S-C-U-B-A:

        But in this word, we have S at position 1 and 5? Duplicate S. We don't know if the secret word has two S's? It might. But we are trying to avoid duplicates to test more letters.

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 07 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
 R: x (R is not in the secret word)
 A: - (A is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
 N: x (N is not in the secret word)
 E: x (E is not in the secret word)

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters C and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, C was in position 1 and A in position 3 of ""crane"", but in the secret word, C is not at position 1 and A is not at position 3.
 - The letters R, N, and E are absent from the secret word.

 Therefore, the secret word has:
   - C and A as present letters, but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively.
   - It does not contain R, N, E.

 We also know that the word is 5 letters long.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
   - Does not contain R, N, E (since they are absent).
   - Includes C and A, but in different positions than in ""crane"" (so C not at position 1, A not at position 3).
   - We can also try to include other common letters to get more information.

 Since C and A are in the word, we should try to place them in new positions.

 Let's think of a word that has:
   - C in a position other than 1 (so positions 2,3,4,5) but note that in the first guess, C was at position 1 and now we know it's not there. However, we don't know where it is, so we can try a different position.
   - A in a position other than 3 (so positions 1,2,4,5).

 Also, we should avoid using R, N, E.

 We can consider other common consonants and vowels. Since we have lost three vowels (A and E) and one consonant (R, N), we might need to use other vowels or common consonants.

 The word must have C and A. Let's try to think of words that have C and A, and avoid R, N, E.

 Possible words: 
   - We can try words with C and A, and also some other common letters.

 Since we have two known letters (C and A), we can try to use them in new positions and add new letters to test.

 Let's try to form a word that places C not at position 1 and A not at position 3.

 Example: 
   Position 1: cannot be C, and we don't know what it is. We can try a new letter for position 1.
   Position 2: we can put C? But note: in the first guess, C was at position 1 and now we know it's not at position 1, but it could be at position 2? However, we don't know yet.

 We can try to put C in position 2 and A in position 4? Or position 5? 

 Let's think of words that have C and A, without R, N, E.

 Some words: 
   - ""CLASP"": but note that C is at position 1 again? We cannot put C at position 1 because we know it's not at position 1. So we must avoid position 1 for C.

   - ""SCALP"": 
        S at position 1 (new), C at position 2 (which is new for C, since previously it was at 1), A at position 3? But wait, in the first guess A was at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not at position 3. However, the feedback for A in the first guess was that it is in the word but not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid that.

   Therefore, for ""SCALP"":
        Position 1: S (new)
        Position 2: C (new position for C, previously it was at 1 -> now 2)
        Position 3: A (but we know A is not at position 3, so this would be incorrect and we know it? But we want to use our knowledge to avoid wasting a position. So we shouldn't put A at position 3 again because we know it's not there).

   So let's avoid position 3 for A.

   How about ""PACT""? But that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

   Let's try ""PACTS"" but that's 5 letters? Actually, ""PACTS"" is 5 letters: P-A-C-T-S. 
        Position 1: P
        Position 2: A -> but we don't know if A can be at position 2? We only know it's not at position 3.
        Position 3: C -> but we know C is not at position 1, but position 3 is new for C? However, we don't know if C can be at position 3? The feedback for C was that it is in the word but not at position 1. So position 3 is still possible.

   But note: we also have to avoid R, N, E. ""PACTS"" doesn't have R, N, E. So that's okay.

   However, we have two known letters (C and A) and we are using them. But we are also introducing P, T, S.

   Alternatively, we can try ""SLATE"" but we know E is absent, so we cannot use E.

   Another word: ""TRACE"" -> but we know R and E are absent, so no.

   How about ""CLAMP""? 
        C at position 1 -> but we know C is not at position 1, so we cannot put C at position 1.

   We must avoid C at position 1 and A at position 3.

   Let's try ""SCAMP"":
        S at 1 (new)
        C at 2 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> this is acceptable because we are trying C in a new position (2)
        A at 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3, so we should avoid that.

   So we need to avoid putting A at position 3.

   How about ""MARCH""? But we know R is absent, so no.

   Another idea: ""PACKS"" -> 
        P at 1 (new)
        A at 2 (new position for A, previously at 3) -> this is acceptable because we are trying A in a new position (2)
        C at 3 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable because we are trying C at 3.
        K at 4 (new)
        S at 5 (new)

   But note: we are using C and A again, but in new positions. Also, we are introducing P, K, S.

   This seems like a good candidate.

   However, we must check if ""PACKS"" is a valid word? Yes, it is.

   But wait: we know that the secret word has C and A, but we don't know if they are in the positions we are trying? We are trying C at position 3 and A at position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses C and A in completely new positions.

   Another word: ""CACTI"" -> but that has two C's and we don't know if the secret word has two C's? Also, C at position 1? We cannot put C at position 1. So no.

   How about ""AUDIO""? But we know U? We don't, but we also know that E is absent and we have to avoid R, N. But ""AUDIO"" has no R, N, E. However, it has A at position 1 and C at position 4? 
        Position 1: A -> we don't know if A can be at position 1? We only know it's not at position 3. So it's acceptable.
        Position 4: C -> acceptable because previously C was at 1, so position 4 is new.

   But note: we are using A at position 1 and C at position 4. Also, we are introducing U, D, I, O.

   However, we have two known letters (A and C) and we are using them. But we are also testing new letters.

   But wait: we have only 6 tries, so we need to get as much information as possible.

   Alternatively, we can try to use a word that doesn't repeat the positions of C and A and also uses new letters.

   Another candidate: ""PACTS"" (as I thought earlier) but note:
        Position 1: P (new)
        Position 2: A (new position for A, previously at 3) -> acceptable.
        Position 3: C (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.
        Position 4: T (new)
        Position 5: S (new)

   This seems good.

   But let me check: we are using A at position 2 and C at position 3. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

   We are also introducing P, T, S.

   Another candidate: ""TACIT"" -> 
        T at 1 (new)
        A at 2 (new position for A, previously at 3) -> acceptable.
        C at 3 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.
        I at 4 (new)
        T at 5 (new) -> but wait, we have two T's? Actually, ""TACIT"" has two T's? 
            T at 1 and 5? That's duplicate T. We don't know if the secret word has two T's? It might. But we are introducing T twice? That might not be efficient because we are using a duplicate letter when we could test two new letters.

   So ""PACTS"" is better because it has all distinct letters: P, A, C, T, S.

   But note: we have to avoid R, N, E. ""PACTS"" doesn't have R, N, E.

   So I think ""PACTS"" is a good second guess.

   However, let me double-check: 
        In the first guess, we had C at position 1 and A at position 3.
        Now in ""PACTS"", we have:
            P at 1 -> new
            A at 2 -> new position for A (previously at 3, so now at 2)
            C at 3 -> new position for C (previously at 1, so now at 3)
            T at 4 -> new
            S at 5 -> new

   This is good.

   But note: we are using A and C again, but that's okay because we are testing them in new positions.

   Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't include C and A? But we know they are in the word, so we should include them to get more information about their positions.

   So I will go with ""PACTS"".

   However, let me think of other words that might cover more vowels? We have lost A and E, so the word must have other vowels? Like I, O, U? 

   We have already tried A and E. So the remaining vowels are I, O, U. We haven't tested any of them.

   In ""PACTS"", we are testing I? No, we are testing S and T. But we are not testing I, O, U.

   Another word: ""CLOUD"" -> but C is at position 1? We cannot put C at position 1. So no.

   How about ""OASIS""? But it has two S's and we don't know if S is in the word. Also, C is missing? We must include C because we know it's in the word.

   We must include both C and A.

   Another word: ""MAGIC"" -> 
        M at 1 (new)
        A at 2 (new position for A, previously at 3) -> acceptable.
        G at 3 (new)
        I at 4 (new)
        C at 5 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.

   This is also a candidate.

   But note: we have two known letters (C and A) and we are using them. We are also testing M, G, I.

   Both ""PACTS"" and ""MAGIC"" are valid.

   However, ""MAGIC"" has C at position 5 and A at position 2. We know that in the secret word, C is not at position 1 and A is not at position 3. So positions 2 and 5 are new for A and C respectively? Actually, we are testing A at 2 and C at 5.

   But we also want to test more common letters. Let's see the frequency.

   We know the secret word has C and A. The word must also have three other letters that we haven't tried? We have eliminated R, N, E. So we have to choose from the remaining letters.

   We can try to cover more vowels? We haven't tested I, O, U. In ""PACTS"", we are not testing any new vowel. In ""MAGIC"", we are testing I.

   Alternatively, we can try ""PACKY"" (if we allow Y) but we don't know if Y is in the word.

   After considering, I think ""PACTS"" is a solid choice because it uses common consonants and we are testing A at 2 and C at 3, which are new positions.

   But note: we are using C at position 3 and A at position 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are testing.

   Another word: ""SAUCE"" -> 
        S at 1 (new)
        A at 2 (new position for A, previously at 3) -> acceptable.
        U at 3 (new vowel)
        C at 4 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.
        E at 5 -> but we know E is absent! So we cannot use E.

   So ""SAUCE"" is invalid because it has E.

   Therefore, ""PACTS"" is good.

   Let me check if ""PACTS"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

   So I will go with ""PACTS"".

   But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know. But ""PACTS"" has no duplicates.

   Alternatively, we can try ""CLAMP"" but C at position 1 is not allowed.

   Another word: ""BACON"" -> but B at 1 (new), A at 2 (new position for A), C at 3 (new position for C), O at 4 (new vowel), N at 5 -> but N is absent! So we cannot use N.

   So ""BACON"" is invalid.

   Therefore, ""PACTS"" seems a good choice.

   But note: we are using C and A again. We are also testing P, T, S.

   We might also consider ""SCALP"", but in ""SCALP"":
        S at 1
        C at 2 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.
        A at 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3? Actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But in our guess, we are putting A at position 3? That would be inefficient because we know it's not at position 3. So we should avoid that.

   Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 3 and C at position 1.

   So ""SCALP"" is invalid because A is at position 3.

   How about ""PALMS""? 
        P at 1
        A at 2 (new position for A) -> acceptable.
        L at 3 (new)
        M at 4 (new)
        S at 5 (new)

   But we are missing C? We must include C because we know it's in the word. So we cannot leave out C.

   Therefore, we must have both C and A.

   Another word: ""MACHO"" -> 
        M at 1
        A at 2 (new position for A) -> acceptable.
        C at 3 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.
        H at 4 (new)
        O at 5 (new vowel)

   This word has both C and A, and avoids R, N, E.

   But note: we are testing O and H.

   How about ""PACKY""? 
        P at 1
        A at 2 (new for A) -> acceptable.
        C at 3 (new for C) -> acceptable.
        K at 4 (new)
        Y at 5 (new)

   This is also a candidate.

   But we have to choose one.

   Let's list the positions we are testing for C: 
        Previously C was at 1, now we are trying C at 2, 3, or 4? In ""PACTS"", we are trying C at 3. In ""MAGIC"", we are trying C at 3? Same in ""PACTS"". Actually, in ""PACTS"", C is at 3 and A at 2.

   We are testing C at 3 and A at 2. We don't know if that's correct, but we are getting information.

   Alternatively, we can try to test C at a position we haven't tried. We only tried position 1 for C. So we can try position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

   Similarly, A was at position 3 and now we are trying at 2, 4, or 5.

   In ""PACTS"", we are testing A at 2 and C at 3.

   We might also consider ""CACTI"" but C at position 1 is not allowed.

   Another word: ""COAST"" -> 
        C at 1 -> not allowed (we know C is not at position 1).

   How about ""SCANT""? -> but N is absent, so no.

   After considering, I think ""PACTS"" is a good choice.

   But note: we are using C and A again. We are also testing P, T, S.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses C and A in completely new positions and also tests other vowels? We haven't tested I, O, U.

   How about ""AUDIO""? But we have to avoid E, R, N. ""AUDIO"" has A at 1, U at 2, D at 3, I at 4, O at 5. 
        But we are not including C? We must include C because we know it's in the word. So we cannot use ""AUDIO"" because it doesn't have C.

   Therefore, we must have C.

   Another word: ""FACET"" -> but E is absent, so no.

   How about ""BACCA"" -> duplicate C? And we don't know if duplicate letters are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, words can have duplicates. However, we don't have evidence for duplicates. Also, we are avoiding duplicate letters in our guess to maximize information.

   So ""PACTS"" is better because it has distinct letters.

   Let me choose ""PACTS"".

   If we get feedback for ""PACTS"", we can learn about the positions of C and A and also test P, T, S.

   So the second guess: ""PACTS""

   But note: we are using C and A again. We are also testing P, T, S.

   We might also consider ""SPACE"": 
        S at 1
        P at 2
        A at 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3! So we should avoid that.

   So no.

   Another word: ""PEACE"" -> has E and we know E is absent.

   How about ""PACIF"" -> not a word.

   So I think ""PACTS"" is a good choice.

   Therefore, I will guess ""PACTS"".

   But let me confirm: 
        We know the secret word has C (not at 1) and A (not at 3). 
        In ""PACTS"": 
            P: new
            A: at position 2 (which is new for A, so we can get feedback on A at 2)
            C: at position 3 (new for C, so we can test if C is at 3)
            T: new
            S: new

   This seems good.

   Alternatively, we can try ""SACRE"" -> but R is absent and E is absent.

   So I think ""PACTS"" is a good second guess.

   We'll go with ""PACTS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as -)
- R, N, and E are not in the word (marked as x)
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked as -)

For the second guess, I need to:
1. Include C and A (since they are in the word), but avoid placing C at position 1 or A at position 3.
2. Exclude R, N, and E (since they are absent).
3. Test new letters to gather more information.

I chose ""pacts"" because:
- It places A at position 2 (a new position for A, avoiding position 3).
- It places C at position 3 (a new position for C, avoiding position 1).
- It introduces three new common consonants (P, T, S) to test their presence.
- It avoids R, N, E, and uses distinct letters to maximize information gain.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

We should choose a word that:\n   - Does not contain R, N, E (since they are absent).\n   - Includes C and A, but in different positions than in ""crane"" (so C not at position 1, A not at position 3).\n   - We can also try to include other common letters to get more information.\n\n Since C and A are in the word, we should try to place them in new positions.\n\n Let\'s think of a word that has:\n   - C in a position other than 1 (so positions 2,3,4,5) but note that in the first guess, C was at position 1 and now we know it\'s not there. However, we don\'t know where it is, so we can try a different position.\n   - A in a position other than 3 (so positions 1,2,4,5).\n\n Also, we should avoid using R, N, E.\n\n We can consider other common consonants and vowels. Since we have lost three vowels (A and E) and one consonant (R, N), we might need to use other vowels or common consonants.\n\n The word must have C and A. Let\'s try to think of words that have C and A, and avoid R, N, E.\n\n Possible words: \n   - We can try words with C and A, and also some other common letters.\n\n Since we have two known letters (C and A), we can try to use them in new positions and add new letters to test.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that places C not at position 1 and A not at position 3.\n\n Example: \n   Position 1: cannot be C, and we don\'t know what it is. We can try a new letter for position 1.\n   Position 2: we can put C? But note: in the first guess, C was at position 1 and now we know it\'s not at position 1, but it could be at position 2? However, we don\'t know yet.\n\n We can try to put C in position 2 and A in position 4? Or position 5? \n\n Let\'s think of words that have C and A, without R, N, E.\n\n Some words: \n   - ""CLASP"": but note that C is at position 1 again? We cannot put C at position 1 because we know it\'s not at position 1. So we must avoid position 1 for C.\n\n   - ""SCALP"": \n        S at position 1 (new), C at position 2 (which is new for C, since previously it was at 1), A at position 3? But wait, in the first guess A was at position 3 and we got a \'-\' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3. So we cannot put A at position 3 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it\'s not at position 3. However, the feedback for A in the first guess was that it is in the word but not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 again, we know it will be wrong. So we should avoid that.\n\n   Therefore, for ""SCALP"":\n        Position 1: S (new)\n        Position 2: C (new position for C, previously it was at 1 -> now 2)\n        Position 3: A (but we know A is not at position 3, so this would be incorrect and we know it? But we want to use our knowledge to avoid wasting a position. So we shouldn\'t put A at position 3 again because we know it\'s not there).\n\n   So let\'s avoid position 3 for A.\n\n   How about ""PACT""? But that\'s 4 letters. We need 5 letters.\n\n   Let\'s try ""PACTS"" but that\'s 5 letters? Actually, ""PACTS"" is 5 letters: P-A-C-T-S. \n        Position 1: P\n        Position 2: A -> but we don\'t know if A can be at position 2? We only know it\'s not at position 3.\n        Position 3: C -> but we know C is not at position 1, but position 3 is new for C? However, we don\'t know if C can be at position 3? The feedback for C was that it is in the word but not at position 1. So position 3 is still possible.\n\n   But note: we also have to avoid R, N, E. ""PACTS"" doesn\'t have R, N, E. So that\'s okay.\n\n   However, we have two known letters (C and A) and we are using them. But we are also introducing P, T, S.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try ""SLATE"" but we know E is absent, so we cannot use E.\n\n   Another word: ""TRACE"" -> but we know R and E are absent, so no.\n\n   How about ""CLAMP""? \n        C at position 1 -> but we know C is not at position 1, so we cannot put C at position 1.\n\n   We must avoid C at position 1 and A at position 3.\n\n   Let\'s try ""SCAMP"":\n        S at 1 (new)\n        C at 2 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> this is acceptable because we are trying C in a new position (2)\n        A at 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3, so we should avoid that.\n\n   So we need to avoid putting A at position 3.\n\n   How about ""MARCH""? But we know R is absent, so no.\n\n   Another idea: ""PACKS"" -> \n        P at 1 (new)\n        A at 2 (new position for A, previously at 3) -> this is acceptable because we are trying A in a new position (2)\n        C at 3 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable because we are trying C at 3.\n        K at 4 (new)\n        S at 5 (new)\n\n   But note: we are using C and A again, but in new positions. Also, we are introducing P, K, S.\n\n   This seems like a good candidate.\n\n   However, we must check if ""PACKS"" is a valid word? Yes, it is.\n\n   But wait: we know that the secret word has C and A, but we don\'t know if they are in the positions we are trying? We are trying C at position 3 and A at position 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses C and A in completely new positions.\n\n   Another word: ""CACTI"" -> but that has two C\'s and we don\'t know if the secret word has two C\'s? Also, C at position 1? We cannot put C at position 1. So no.\n\n   How about ""AUDIO""? But we know U? We don\'t, but we also know that E is absent and we have to avoid R, N. But ""AUDIO"" has no R, N, E. However, it has A at position 1 and C at position 4? \n        Position 1: A -> we don\'t know if A can be at position 1? We only know it\'s not at position 3. So it\'s acceptable.\n        Position 4: C -> acceptable because previously C was at 1, so position 4 is new.\n\n   But note: we are using A at position 1 and C at position 4. Also, we are introducing U, D, I, O.\n\n   However, we have two known letters (A and C) and we are using them. But we are also testing new letters.\n\n   But wait: we have only 6 tries, so we need to get as much information as possible.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to use a word that doesn\'t repeat the positions of C and A and also uses new letters.\n\n   Another candidate: ""PACTS"" (as I thought earlier) but note:\n        Position 1: P (new)\n        Position 2: A (new position for A, previously at 3) -> acceptable.\n        Position 3: C (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.\n        Position 4: T (new)\n        Position 5: S (new)\n\n   This seems good.\n\n   But let me check: we are using A at position 2 and C at position 3. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n   We are also introducing P, T, S.\n\n   Another candidate: ""TACIT"" -> \n        T at 1 (new)\n        A at 2 (new position for A, previously at 3) -> acceptable.\n        C at 3 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.\n        I at 4 (new)\n        T at 5 (new) -> but wait, we have two T\'s? Actually, ""TACIT"" has two T\'s? \n            T at 1 and 5? That\'s duplicate T. We don\'t know if the secret word has two T\'s? It might. But we are introducing T twice? That might not be efficient because we are using a duplicate letter when we could test two new letters.\n\n   So ""PACTS"" is better because it has all distinct letters: P, A, C, T, S.\n\n   But note: we have to avoid R, N, E. ""PACTS"" doesn\'t have R, N, E.\n\n   So I think ""PACTS"" is a good second guess.\n\n   However, let me double-check: \n        In the first guess, we had C at position 1 and A at position 3.\n        Now in ""PACTS"", we have:\n            P at 1 -> new\n            A at 2 -> new position for A (previously at 3, so now at 2)\n            C at 3 -> new position for C (previously at 1, so now at 3)\n            T at 4 -> new\n            S at 5 -> new\n\n   This is good.\n\n   But note: we are using A and C again, but that\'s okay because we are testing them in new positions.\n\n   Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn\'t include C and A? But we know they are in the word, so we should include them to get more information about their positions.\n\n   So I will go with ""PACTS"".\n\n   However, let me think of other words that might cover more vowels? We have lost A and E, so the word must have other vowels? Like I, O, U? \n\n   We have already tried A and E. So the remaining vowels are I, O, U. We haven\'t tested any of them.\n\n   In ""PACTS"", we are testing I? No, we are testing S and T. But we are not testing I, O, U.\n\n   Another word: ""CLOUD"" -> but C is at position 1? We cannot put C at position 1. So no.\n\n   How about ""OASIS""? But it has two S\'s and we don\'t know if S is in the word. Also, C is missing? We must include C because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n   We must include both C and A.\n\n   Another word: ""MAGIC"" -> \n        M at 1 (new)\n        A at 2 (new position for A, previously at 3) -> acceptable.\n        G at 3 (new)\n        I at 4 (new)\n        C at 5 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.\n\n   This is also a candidate.\n\n   But note: we have two known letters (C and A) and we are using them. We are also testing M, G, I.\n\n   Both ""PACTS"" and ""MAGIC"" are valid.\n\n   However, ""MAGIC"" has C at position 5 and A at position 2. We know that in the secret word, C is not at position 1 and A is not at position 3. So positions 2 and 5 are new for A and C respectively? Actually, we are testing A at 2 and C at 5.\n\n   But we also want to test more common letters. Let\'s see the frequency.\n\n   We know the secret word has C and A. The word must also have three other letters that we haven\'t tried? We have eliminated R, N, E. So we have to choose from the remaining letters.\n\n   We can try to cover more vowels? We haven\'t tested I, O, U. In ""PACTS"", we are not testing any new vowel. In ""MAGIC"", we are testing I.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try ""PACKY"" (if we allow Y) but we don\'t know if Y is in the word.\n\n   After considering, I think ""PACTS"" is a solid choice because it uses common consonants and we are testing A at 2 and C at 3, which are new positions.\n\n   But note: we are using C at position 3 and A at position 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are testing.\n\n   Another word: ""SAUCE"" -> \n        S at 1 (new)\n        A at 2 (new position for A, previously at 3) -> acceptable.\n        U at 3 (new vowel)\n        C at 4 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.\n        E at 5 -> but we know E is absent! So we cannot use E.\n\n   So ""SAUCE"" is invalid because it has E.\n\n   Therefore, ""PACTS"" is good.\n\n   Let me check if ""PACTS"" is a valid word: yes, it is.\n\n   So I will go with ""PACTS"".\n\n   But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don\'t know. But ""PACTS"" has no duplicates.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try ""CLAMP"" but C at position 1 is not allowed.\n\n   Another word: ""BACON"" -> but B at 1 (new), A at 2 (new position for A), C at 3 (new position for C), O at 4 (new vowel), N at 5 -> but N is absent! So we cannot use N.\n\n   So ""BACON"" is invalid.\n\n   Therefore, ""PACTS"" seems a good choice.\n\n   But note: we are using C and A again. We are also testing P, T, S.\n\n   We might also consider ""SCALP"", but in ""SCALP"":\n        S at 1\n        C at 2 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.\n        A at 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3? Actually, we know that in the secret word, A is not at position 3. But in our guess, we are putting A at position 3? That would be inefficient because we know it\'s not at position 3. So we should avoid that.\n\n   Therefore, we must avoid putting A at position 3 and C at position 1.\n\n   So ""SCALP"" is invalid because A is at position 3.\n\n   How about ""PALMS""? \n        P at 1\n        A at 2 (new position for A) -> acceptable.\n        L at 3 (new)\n        M at 4 (new)\n        S at 5 (new)\n\n   But we are missing C? We must include C because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot leave out C.\n\n   Therefore, we must have both C and A.\n\n   Another word: ""MACHO"" -> \n        M at 1\n        A at 2 (new position for A) -> acceptable.\n        C at 3 (new position for C, previously at 1) -> acceptable.\n        H at 4 (new)\n        O at 5 (new vowel)\n\n   This word has both C and A, and avoids R, N, E.\n\n   But note: we are testing O and H.\n\n   How about ""PACKY""? \n        P at 1\n        A at 2 (new for A) -> acceptable.\n        C at 3 (new for C) -> acceptable.\n        K at 4 (new)\n        Y at 5 (new)\n\n   This is also a candidate.\n\n   But we have to choose one.\n\n   Let\'s list the positions we are testing for C: \n        Previously C was at 1, now we are trying C at 2, 3, or 4? In ""PACTS"", we are trying C at 3. In ""MAGIC"", we are trying C at 3? Same in ""PACTS"". Actually, in ""PACTS"", C is at 3 and A at 2.\n\n   We are testing C at 3 and A at 2. We don\'t know if that\'s correct, but we are getting information.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try to test C at a position we haven\'t tried. We only tried position 1 for C. So we can try position 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n   Similarly, A was at position 3 and now we are trying at 2, 4, or 5.\n\n   In ""PACTS"", we are testing A at 2 and C at 3.\n\n   We might also consider ""CACTI"" but C at position 1 is not allowed.\n\n   Another word: ""COAST"" -> \n        C at 1 -> not allowed (we know C is not at position 1).\n\n   How about ""SCANT""? -> but N is absent, so no.\n\n   After considering, I think ""PACTS"" is a good choice.\n\n   But note: we are using C and A again. We are also testing P, T, S.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses C and A in completely new positions and also tests other vowels? We haven\'t tested I, O, U.\n\n   How about ""AUDIO""? But we have to avoid E, R, N. ""AUDIO"" has A at 1, U at 2, D at 3, I at 4, O at 5. \n        But we are not including C? We must include C because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot use ""AUDIO"" because it doesn\'t have C.\n\n   Therefore, we must have C.\n\n   Another word: ""FACET"" -> but E is absent, so no.\n\n   How about ""BACCA"" -> duplicate C? And we don\'t know if duplicate letters are allowed? The rules don\'t say, but typically in Wordle, words can have duplicates. However, we don\'t have evidence for duplicates. Also, we are avoiding duplicate letters in our guess to maximize information.\n\n   So ""PACTS"" is better because it has distinct letters.\n\n   Let me choose ""PACTS"".\n\n   If we get feedback for ""PACTS"", we can learn about the positions of C and A and also test P, T, S.\n\n   So the second guess: ""PACTS""\n\n   But note: we are using C and A again. We are also testing P, T, S.\n\n   We might also consider ""SPACE"": \n        S at 1\n        P at 2\n        A at 3 -> but we know A is not at position 3! So we should avoid that.\n\n   So no.\n\n   Another word: ""PEACE"" -> has E and we know E is absent.\n\n   How about ""PACIF"" -> not a word.\n\n   So I think ""PACTS"" is a good choice.\n\n   Therefore, I will guess ""PACTS"".\n\n   But let me confirm: \n        We know the secret word has C (not at 1) and A (not at 3). \n        In ""PACTS"": \n            P: new\n            A: at position 2 (which is new for A, so we can get feedback on A at 2)\n            C: at position 3 (new for C, so we can test if C is at 3)\n            T: new\n            S: new\n\n   This seems good.\n\n   Alternatively, we can try ""SACRE"" -> but R is absent and E is absent.\n\n   So I think ""PACTS"" is a good second guess.\n\n   We\'ll go with ""PACTS"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is in the word but not in position 1 (marked as -)\n- R, N, and E are not in the word (marked as x)\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked as -)\n\nFor the second guess, I need to:\n1.

We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(-), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
   - This tells us: 
        - C is in the word, but not at position 1.
        - R, N, E are not in the word.
        - A is in the word, but not at position 3.

2. ""pacts"": P(x), A(-), C(-), T(x), S(✓)
   - Interpretation:
        - S is in the word and at position 5 (since it's marked ✓).
        - P is not in the word (x).
        - A is in the word but not at position 2 (because it was at position 2 in this guess and marked -).
        - C is in the word but not at position 3 (because it was at position 3 in this guess and marked -).
        - T is not in the word (x).

   So now we know:
        - The secret word has S at position 5.
        - The secret word contains A and C, but not at the positions we've tried: 
            - A is not at position 3 (from first guess) and not at position 2 (from second guess).
            - C is not at position 1 (from first guess) and not at position 3 (from second guess).
        - The secret word does not contain: R, N, E, P, T.

   Also, we know the word has 5 letters, ends with S, and contains A, C, and S.

   So the secret word pattern: _ _ _ _ S

   We need to include A and C in the word, but avoid the positions we know are wrong for them.

   Positions for A: cannot be 2 or 3. So possible positions: 1 or 4? Because the word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5.
   Similarly, C cannot be at position 1 or 3. So C must be at position 2 or 4.

   But note: we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, we haven't seen any duplicates so far.

   Now, we know the word has S at the end, and contains A, C, and S. Also, we have eliminated R, N, E, P, T.

   We need to choose a third guess that:
        - Must be a valid 5-letter word ending with S? Not necessarily, but we know the last letter is S, so it must be placed at the end.

        - Must include A and C, but avoid placing A at positions 2 or 3, and C at positions 1 or 3.

        - Avoid letters: R, N, E, P, T.

   Also, we are introducing new letters to test.

   Let's consider the positions:

   The secret word has: 
        Position 5: S (fixed)

   And we know A and C are in the word, so they must be in positions 1,2,3,4, but with constraints:
        - A cannot be at 2 or 3 -> so A must be at position 1 or 4.
        - C cannot be at 1 or 3 -> so C must be at position 2 or 4.

   But note: position 4 could be A or C? Or both? But we don't know if they are duplicates.

   However, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback, so we assume no duplicates for now.

   So the possibilities:

        Case 1: A at 1, then C must be at 2 or 4.
        Case 2: A at 4, then C must be at 2 (since position 4 is taken by A, and C cannot be at 1 or 3, so only position 2 left).

   But wait: if A is at 4, then position 4 is taken, and C must be at 2. Then the word would be: _ C _ A S

   Similarly, if A is at 1 and C at 2: word: A C _ _ S
   If A at 1 and C at 4: word: A _ _ C S

   We need to fill the middle positions with letters that are not R, N, E, P, T.

   We also need to choose a word that tests new letters.

   Let's think of words that end with S and contain A and C, without R, N, E, P, T.

   Possible words:

        - If pattern: A C _ _ S
            Examples: ""ACIDS"", ""ACOES"", ""ACUES"", ""ACOLES""? But we must avoid E? So ""ACOLES"" is invalid (has E). 
            ""ACIDS"": A at 1, C at 2, I at 3, D at 4, S at 5 -> but we haven't tested I and D. Also, note that in ""ACIDS"", A is at 1 and C at 2. But we know from the first guess that C is not at position 1 (which is true) and from the second guess that A is not at position 2 (which is also true because A is at 1) and C not at position 3 (which is satisfied because C is at 2). 
            But we must check if the word is valid: ""ACIDS"" is a word.

        - Pattern: A _ _ C S
            Examples: ""A D I C S"" -> ""ADICS""? Not a word.
            ""A B I C S"" -> ""ABICS""? Not a word.
            ""A M I C S"" -> ""AMICS""? Not a word.
            ""A F I C S"" -> ""AFICS""? No.
            ""A W I C S"" -> ""AWICS""? No.
            ""A V I C S"" -> ""AVICS""? No.

        - Pattern: _ C _ A S
            Examples: ""O C A S S""? Duplicate S? 
            ""O C E A S"" -> has E? E is absent, so no.
            ""O C U A S"" -> ""OCUAS""? Not a word.
            ""O C T A S"" -> has T? T is absent, so no.
            ""O C A S S"" -> duplicate S? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. But the feedback hasn't shown any duplicate so far. However, we cannot rule out duplicates. But ""OCASS"" is not a word.

        - Pattern: _ _ C A S
            Examples: ""B C A S S"" -> duplicate S? 
            ""B O C A S"" -> ""BOCAS""? Not a word.
            ""B U C A S"" -> ""BUCAS""? No.
            ""D U C A S"" -> ""DUCAS""? No.
            ""F L C A S"" -> ""FLCAS""? No.

        - Pattern: _ C _ _ S, with C at position 2 and A at position 4: 
            Word: ? C ? A S
            Examples: ""SCA S"" -> but we need 5 letters: ""SCARS""? Has R -> invalid.
            ""O C E A S"" -> has E -> invalid.
            ""O C T A S"" -> has T -> invalid.
            ""O C U A S"" -> ""OCUAS""? No.

        - Pattern: _ _ _ A S, with C at position 2: 
            Word: ? C ? A S
            Examples: ""SCA S"" -> no, because that would be S at 1 and 5? But we need 5 letters: ""SCALA""? But that's 5 letters? S-C-A-L-A? But then A is at position 3? We know A is not at position 3. Also, duplicate A? We don't know.

        Actually, if we put C at position 2 and A at position 4, then the word is: _ C _ A S.

        Examples: ""SCA S"" is not 5 letters? Wait, ""SCAL"" is 4. 
        ""SCABS""? Has B and S? But S is at the end. But ""SCABS"" is 5: S-C-A-B-S. 
        But we have S at the end? Yes. And A is at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3. So invalid.

        How about ""SCRAM""? But has R and we know R is absent.

        ""SCals""? -> ""SCAL"" is 4 letters. ""SCALP"" has P which is absent.

        ""SCAMS""? -> ""SCAM"" is 4, so ""SCAMS"" is 5? S-C-A-M-S. But then A is at position 3? Not allowed.

        It seems difficult to find a word with pattern _ C _ A S.

   So let's focus on patterns:

        Pattern 1: A at 1, C at 2 -> word: A C ? ? S
        Pattern 2: A at 1, C at 4 -> word: A ? ? C S
        Pattern 3: A at 4, C at 2 -> word: ? C ? A S

   Pattern 1: A C ? ? S
        We need two letters in the middle. Without R,N,E,P,T.
        Possible words: 
            ""ACIDS"" -> as I thought earlier: A-C-I-D-S -> positions: A(1), C(2), I(3), D(4), S(5). 
            This avoids the forbidden letters: no R,N,E,P,T.

        ""ACIDS"" is a valid word.

        But note: in ""ACIDS"", 
            A is at position 1 -> we haven't tested A at position 1 before? We tested A at position 3 (in crane) and at position 2 (in pacts). So position 1 is new for A.
            C is at position 2 -> we haven't tested C at position 2? Previously C was at 1 and 3. So position 2 is new for C.

        Also, we are testing I and D.

        So ""ACIDS"" seems a good candidate.

        However, we must check if it satisfies the constraints:
            - A is not at 2 or 3: yes, A is at 1 -> acceptable.
            - C is not at 1 or 3: yes, C is at 2 -> acceptable.
            - No R,N,E,P,T: correct.

        So let's consider ""ACIDS"".

   Pattern 2: A ? ? C S
        We need to fill positions 2 and 3. Without R,N,E,P,T.
        Example: ""A D U C S"" -> ""ADUCS""? No.
        ""A M U C S"" -> ""AMUCS""? No.
        ""A B U C S"" -> ""ABUCS""? No.
        ""A F U C S"" -> ""AFUCS""? No.

        How about ""A L I C S""? ""ALICS"" -> not a word? 
        ""A L O C S"" -> ""ALOCS""? No.

        Pattern 3: ? C ? A S
        Examples: 
            ""O C U A S"" -> ""OCUAS""? No.
            ""O C E A S"" -> has E -> invalid.
            ""O C T A S"" -> has T -> invalid.

        ""O C H A S"" -> ""OCHAS""? No.

        ""B C O A S"" -> ""BCOAS""? No.

        ""D C O A S"" -> ""DCOAS""? No.

        It seems hard to find words for patterns 2 and 3.

   So pattern 1: A C ? ? S -> ""ACIDS"" is a candidate.

   But note: we are testing C at position 2. We know from the first guess that C is in the word, but we don't know where. We are testing position 2 for C. If it's correct, we get a ✓, if not, we get a '-' and know it's elsewhere.

   Also, we are testing A at position 1.

   Alternatively, we can try to cover more letters? We have only tested 5 letters: C, R, A, N, E (first guess) and P, A, C, T, S (second). So we have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   We can try to include one of these to test.

   But ""ACIDS"" uses I and D. I is a vowel and D is a consonant.

   Another word: ""ACHOO"" -> but that doesn't end with S.

   We need the word to end with S.

   How about ""ACIDS"" or ""ACOES"" -> but has E? E is absent.

   So ""ACIDS"" is a good candidate.

   But wait: what about the possibility that A is at position 4 and C at position 2? We didn't find a good word for that pattern.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that tests A at position 4 and C at position 2? But we couldn't find a common word.

   Another word: ""A C K S"" -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5. ""ACKS"" is 4.

   How about ""A C T S"" -> but T is absent.

   So let's go with ""ACIDS"".

   But note: we are using C and A again, but that's okay because we are testing new positions.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't repeat the positions of A and C and also tests new letters.

   But ""ACIDS"" is one.

   Another word: ""SCALP"" -> but we know P is absent and also A is at position 3? We know A is not at position 3, so we shouldn't put A at 3.

   How about ""CAULK"" -> but doesn't end with S.

   We need the word to end with S.

   Another word: ""C A U S S"" -> duplicate S? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, A is at position 2? We know A is not at position 2 (from the second guess: A at position 2 was marked as '-'). So we cannot put A at position 2.

   Therefore, ""ACIDS"" is a good choice.

   But let me check: 
        Position 1: A -> testing A at position 1.
        Position 2: C -> testing C at position 2.
        Position 3: I -> new letter.
        Position 4: D -> new letter.
        Position 5: S -> known.

   We are testing two new letters: I and D.

   If the feedback shows:
        - If A is at position 1, we get ✓ for A.
        - If C is at position 2, we get ✓ for C.

   But we don't know if they are at these positions.

   Alternatively, we can try to test A at position 4 and C at position 2? But we need a word that fits _ C ? A S. We couldn't find one. 

   Another idea: what about ""O C E A S""? But has E -> invalid.

   How about ""O C T A S"" -> T is absent.

   So it seems that the only feasible pattern is A C ? ? S, with the middle two letters being new.

   Therefore, I choose ""ACIDS"".

   But wait: we know that in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and it was wrong, and in the second guess, A at position 2 was wrong. Now we are trying A at position 1. If it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know A must be at position 4 (since only positions 1 and 4 are left for A? Positions 1 and 4 are possible for A, and position 4 for C? But C can be at 2 or 4. 

   Actually, for A: we know it cannot be at 2 or 3. So only positions 1 and 4. 
   For C: it cannot be at 1 or 3. So positions 2 and 4.

   So if in ""ACIDS"", A is at 1 and C is at 2, then we are testing two possibilities at once.

   If A is at 1, then we get ✓ for A. If not, then A must be at 4.

   Similarly, if C is at 2, we get ✓ for C. If not, then C must be at 4.

   But note: if A is at 4 and C at 2, then in ""ACIDS"", A at 1 would be marked as '-' (if A is at 4) and C at 2 would be ✓? But we are also testing D at 4? Actually, in ""ACIDS"", the A is at 1, C at 2, and then I at 3, D at 4, S at 5.

   If the secret word has A at 4 and C at 2, then we would get:
        A at 1: '-' (because A is in the word but not at 1? But wait, if A is at 4, then A at 1 is not present? Actually, no: the feedback for A would be '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 1. And C at 2 would be ✓.

   But that would tell us that A is at position 4? Not necessarily, because we have only one A? But the feedback doesn't specify how many A's? We don't know if there are duplicates.

   Actually, the feedback for ""p acts"" told us that A is in the word (marked '-') but we don't know if it's one or two. Similarly for C.

   However, in ""ACIDS"", we are testing A at 1 and C at 2. If the secret word has A at 4 and C at 2, then we would get:
        A at 1: '-' (because A is in the word but not at 1) -> but then we know A must be at 4 (since we know it's not at 1,2,3).
        C at 2: ✓ (because C is at 2 in the secret word) -> but wait, the secret word has C at 2, so ✓.
        Then I at 3: we don't know, but if the secret word has I, then ✓, else if I is absent, then x. But we are testing I.

   But if the secret word has A at 4 and C at 2, then in ""ACIDS"", we would get:
        A at 1: '-' -> because A is at 4? But we haven't tested position 4 for A? Actually, we are testing A at 1. If A is at 4, then we get '-' for A at 1 and then we know A is at 4.
        C at 2: ✓ -> because C is at 2 in the secret word.

   So we would get feedback: A(-), C(✓), I(?), D(?), S(✓). 

   But we would know that A is at 4? Not necessarily, because the feedback for A is '-' meaning it's in the word but not at 1, but we don't know where it is exactly. We would have to guess again.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests A at position 4 and C at position 2? But we couldn't find a common word.

   So maybe ""ACIDS"" is a reasonable guess.

   But note: we are testing C at position 2. We know C is in the word, but we don't know if it's at 2. If we get ✓ for C, then we know it's at 2. If we get '-', then C is not at 2 and must be at 4 (since only positions 2 and 4 are possible for C? Positions 2 and 4 are possible, but if we get '-' for C, then it must be at 4? Because we know C is not at 1 or 3, and 2 is the only other possibility? Actually, we have two positions: 2 and 4. If we put C at 2 and get ✓, then it's at 2. If we get '-', then it must be at 4.

   Similarly for A: if we put A at 1 and get ✓, then A is at 1. If we get '-', then A must be at 4.

   So ""ACIDS"" is testing two positions at once.

   But we are also testing I and D.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put A and C in the same position as the second guess? The second guess had A at 2 and C at 3, both wrong. Now we are trying A at 1 and C at 2. That's a new position for A (1) and for C (2). So that's good.

   Another candidate: ""CAVAS""? Not a word.

   How about ""MACHO""? 
        M at 1 (new)
        A at 2 -> but we know A is not at position 2! So we cannot put A at 2.

   So no.

   Another word: ""CIVIL"" -> doesn't end with S.

   So I think ""ACIDS"" is a good choice.

   But let me think of other words that fit the constraints.

   What about ""A C K S""? 4 letters.

   How about ""A C T S""? T is absent.

   Another word: ""A C E S""? E is absent.

   So ""ACIDS"" seems the best.

   However, note: we have S at the end, so we are sure about S.

   But wait: we know the secret word has C and A, and S at the end. We also know the word does not have R,N,E,P,T.

   We can also consider ""SCALY"" -> but Y is new, and we are testing Y. But ""SCALY"" has A at position 3? We know A is not at position 3. So we avoid.

   How about ""SCAMP""? 
        S at 1 -> but we know S is at the end? Actually, we know S is at position 5, but in ""SCAMP"", S is at position 1 and 5? That would be two S's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are testing M and P? But P is absent.

   So no.

   Another word: ""CAULK"" -> doesn't end with S.

   So I think ""ACIDS"" is a valid choice.

   Therefore, I will guess ""ACIDS"".

   But note: we are using C and A again. We are also testing I and D.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses A and C in new positions and also tests other vowels? We haven't tested O or U.

   How about ""AUDIO""? But we must have C? We cannot skip C.

   Another word: ""CLOUD"" -> C at 1 -> not allowed.

   So I think ""ACIDS"" is the best.

   But let me double-check the feedback we have:

        We know:
          Position 5: S
          Letters in the word: A, C, S (and we think S is at the end, but we don't know for sure? Actually, we know S is at position 5, so S is definitely in the word and at the correct position.

        We don't know: 
          - If there are duplicate S? We haven't seen any duplicate feedback, so we assume no duplicates? But the feedback for S in the second guess was ✓, so we know S is at position 5 and nothing more.

        But in the first guess, we had S? No, the first guess had no S. The first guess was ""crane"": C,R,A,N,E. No S.

        So S is a new letter we tested in the second guess.

        Now, we are using S at the end.

        So ""ACIDS"" is a valid word.

   Let me write it: A C I D S

   But note: we are testing I and D. If the secret word has I and D, we get information.

   We might also consider ""SCUBA"" -> but doesn't end with S? It ends with A. We need to end with S.

   Another word: ""ACIDS"" is one.

   But wait: what about ""A C O S S""? Duplicate S? And ""ACOSS"" is not a word.

   How about ""A C K S"" -> 4 letters.

   So I think ""ACIDS"" is a good choice.

   Therefore, the third guess: ""ACIDS""

   But let me confirm the pattern:
        Position 1: A -> we are testing A at 1.
        Position 2: C -> testing C at 2.
        Position 3: I -> new letter.
        Position 4: D -> new letter.
        Position 5: S -> known.

   We are testing two new letters (I and D) and also testing A and C in new positions.

   If the feedback shows:
        - If A is at 1, we get ✓ for A.
        - If C is at 2, we get ✓ for C.
        - Then we might get information about I and D.

   But if the secret word has A at 4 and C at 2, then in ""ACIDS"":
        A at 1: '-' -> because A is at 4? But we haven't tested position 4 for A? Actually, we are testing A at 1. If A is at 4, then we get '-' meaning A is in the word but not at 1, and then we know A must be at 4 (since we know it's not at 1,2,3). Then C at 2: ✓? Because C is at 2 in the secret word? But we don't know that. We only know C is at 2 or 4. So if we get ✓ for C at 2, then we know C is at 2. If we get '-' for C at 2, then C must be at 4.

   So we are learning.

   Therefore, I choose ""ACIDS"".

   But note: we are testing A at position 1 and C at position 2. We know that in the secret word, C cannot be at 1 or 3, and A cannot be at 2 or 3. So position 1 for A is a new position, and position 2 for C is a new position.

   So let's go with that.

   Guess: ""ACIDS""

   Format: <guess>acids</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C is in the word but not position 1 (-), R/N/E are absent (x), A is in the word but not position 3 (-).
- **Guess 2 (pacts)**: P is absent (x), A is in the word but not position 2 (-), C is in the word but not position 3 (-), T is absent (x), S is correct at position 5 (✓).

### Key Insights:
1. **S is fixed at position 5**.
2. **A and C are present** but mispositioned:
   - A cannot be at positions 2 or 3 → must be at position 1 or 4.
   - C cannot be at positions 1 or 3 → must be at position 2 or 4.
3. **Absent letters**: R, N, E, P, T.
4. The secret word pattern: `_ _ _ _ S`.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test **A at position 1** and **C at position 2** (new positions for both).
- Introduce **new letters** to gather more information (choosing common consonants like D and I).
- Avoid absent letters (R,N,E,P,T) and forbidden positions for A/C.

**Chosen word: ""ACIDS""**  
- A at position 1 (tests if A is at start/end)  
- C at position 2 (tests if C is in middle)  
- I at position 3 (new vowel)  
- D at position 4 (new consonant)  
- S at position 5 (confirmed)  

This guess efficiently tests new positions for A/C while probing new letters (I, D) and leveraging known S at end.

<guess>acids</guess>",acids,"We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(-), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
   - This tells us: 
        - C is in the word, but not at position 1.
        - R, N, E are not in the word.
        - A is in the word, but not at position 3.

2. ""pacts"": P(x), A(-), C(-), T(x), S(✓)
   - Interpretation:
        - S is in the word and at position 5 (since it's marked ✓).
        - P is not in the word (x).
        - A is in the word but not at position 2 (because it was at position 2 in this guess and marked -).
        - C is in the word but not at position 3 (because it was at position 3 in this guess and marked -).
        - T is not in the word (x).

   So now we know:
        - The secret word has S at position 5.
        - The secret word contains A and C, but not at the positions we've tried: 
            - A is not at position 3 (from first guess) and not at position 2 (from second guess).
            - C is not at position 1 (from first guess) and not at position 3 (from second guess).
        - The secret word does not contain: R, N, E, P, T.

   Also, we know the word has 5 letters, ends with S, and contains A, C, and S.

   So the secret word pattern: _ _ _ _ S

   We need to include A and C in the word, but avoid the positions we know are wrong for them.

   Positions for A: cannot be 2 or 3. So possible positions: 1 or 4? Because the word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5.
   Similarly, C cannot be at position 1 or 3. So C must be at position 2 or 4.

   But note: we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, we haven't seen any duplicates so far.

   Now, we know the word has S at the end, and contains A, C, and S. Also, we have eliminated R, N, E, P, T.

   We need to choose a third guess that:
        - Must be a valid 5-letter word ending with S? Not necessarily, but we know the last letter is S, so it must be placed at the end.

        - Must include A and C, but avoid placing A at positions 2 or 3, and C at positions 1 or 3.

        - Avoid letters: R, N, E, P, T.

   Also, we are introducing new letters to test.

   Let's consider the positions:

   The secret word has: 
        Position 5: S (fixed)

   And we know A and C are in the word, so they must be in positions 1,2,3,4, but with constraints:
        - A cannot be at 2 or 3 -> so A must be at position 1 or 4.
        - C cannot be at 1 or 3 -> so C must be at position 2 or 4.

   But note: position 4 could be A or C? Or both? But we don't know if they are duplicates.

   However, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback, so we assume no duplicates for now.

   So the possibilities:

        Case 1: A at 1, then C must be at 2 or 4.
        Case 2: A at 4, then C must be at 2 (since position 4 is taken by A, and C cannot be at 1 or 3, so only position 2 left).

   But wait: if A is at 4, then position 4 is taken, and C must be at 2. Then the word would be: _ C _ A S

   Similarly, if A is at 1 and C at 2: word: A C _ _ S
   If A at 1 and C at 4: word: A _ _ C S

   We need to fill the middle positions with letters that are not R, N, E, P, T.

   We also need to choose a word that tests new letters.

   Let's think of words that end with S and contain A and C, without R, N, E, P, T.

   Possible words:

        - If pattern: A C _ _ S
            Examples: ""ACIDS"", ""ACOES"", ""ACUES"", ""ACOLES""? But we must avoid E? So ""ACOLES"" is invalid (has E). 
            ""ACIDS"": A at 1, C at 2, I at 3, D at 4, S at 5 -> but we haven't tested I and D. Also, note that in ""ACIDS"", A is at 1 and C at 2. But we know from the first guess that C is not at position 1 (which is true) and from the second guess that A is not at position 2 (which is also true because A is at 1) and C not at position 3 (which is satisfied because C is at 2). 
            But we must check if the word is valid: ""ACIDS"" is a word.

        - Pattern: A _ _ C S
            Examples: ""A D I C S"" -> ""ADICS""? Not a word.
            ""A B I C S"" -> ""ABICS""? Not a word.
            ""A M I C S"" -> ""AMICS""? Not a word.
            ""A F I C S"" -> ""AFICS""? No.
            ""A W I C S"" -> ""AWICS""? No.
            ""A V I C S"" -> ""AVICS""? No.

        - Pattern: _ C _ A S
            Examples: ""O C A S S""? Duplicate S? 
            ""O C E A S"" -> has E? E is absent, so no.
            ""O C U A S"" -> ""OCUAS""? Not a word.
            ""O C T A S"" -> has T? T is absent, so no.
            ""O C A S S"" -> duplicate S? We don't know if duplicates are allowed. But the feedback hasn't shown any duplicate so far. However, we cannot rule out duplicates. But ""OCASS"" is not a word.

        - Pattern: _ _ C A S
            Examples: ""B C A S S"" -> duplicate S? 
            ""B O C A S"" -> ""BOCAS""? Not a word.
            ""B U C A S"" -> ""BUCAS""? No.
            ""D U C A S"" -> ""DUCAS""? No.
            ""F L C A S"" -> ""FLCAS""? No.

        - Pattern: _ C _ _ S, with C at position 2 and A at position 4: 
            Word: ? C ? A S
            Examples: ""SCA S"" -> but we need 5 letters: ""SCARS""? Has R -> invalid.
            ""O C E A S"" -> has E -> invalid.
            ""O C T A S"" -> has T -> invalid.
            ""O C U A S"" -> ""OCUAS""? No.

        - Pattern: _ _ _ A S, with C at position 2: 
            Word: ? C ? A S
            Examples: ""SCA S"" -> no, because that would be S at 1 and 5? But we need 5 letters: ""SCALA""? But that's 5 letters? S-C-A-L-A? But then A is at position 3? We know A is not at position 3. Also, duplicate A? We don't know.

        Actually, if we put C at position 2 and A at position 4, then the word is: _ C _ A S.

        Examples: ""SCA S"" is not 5 letters? Wait, ""SCAL"" is 4. 
        ""SCABS""? Has B and S? But S is at the end. But ""SCABS"" is 5: S-C-A-B-S. 
        But we have S at the end? Yes. And A is at position 3? But we know A is not at position 3. So invalid.

        How about ""SCRAM""? But has R and we know R is absent.

        ""SCals""? -> ""SCAL"" is 4 letters. ""SCALP"" has P which is absent.

        ""SCAMS""? -> ""SCAM"" is 4, so ""SCAMS"" is 5? S-C-A-M-S. But then A is at position 3? Not allowed.

        It seems difficult to find a word with pattern _ C _ A S.

   So let's focus on patterns:

        Pattern 1: A at 1, C at 2 -> word: A C ? ? S
        Pattern 2: A at 1, C at 4 -> word: A ? ? C S
        Pattern 3: A at 4, C at 2 -> word: ? C ? A S

   Pattern 1: A C ? ? S
        We need two letters in the middle. Without R,N,E,P,T.
        Possible words: 
            ""ACIDS"" -> as I thought earlier: A-C-I-D-S -> positions: A(1), C(2), I(3), D(4), S(5). 
            This avoids the forbidden letters: no R,N,E,P,T.

        ""ACIDS"" is a valid word.

        But note: in ""ACIDS"", 
            A is at position 1 -> we haven't tested A at position 1 before? We tested A at position 3 (in crane) and at position 2 (in pacts). So position 1 is new for A.
            C is at position 2 -> we haven't tested C at position 2? Previously C was at 1 and 3. So position 2 is new for C.

        Also, we are testing I and D.

        So ""ACIDS"" seems a good candidate.

        However, we must check if it satisfies the constraints:
            - A is not at 2 or 3: yes, A is at 1 -> acceptable.
            - C is not at 1 or 3: yes, C is at 2 -> acceptable.
            - No R,N,E,P,T: correct.

        So let's consider ""ACIDS"".

   Pattern 2: A ? ? C S
        We need to fill positions 2 and 3. Without R,N,E,P,T.
        Example: ""A D U C S"" -> ""ADUCS""? No.
        ""A M U C S"" -> ""AMUCS""? No.
        ""A B U C S"" -> ""ABUCS""? No.
        ""A F U C S"" -> ""AFUCS""? No.

        How about ""A L I C S""? ""ALICS"" -> not a word? 
        ""A L O C S"" -> ""ALOCS""? No.

        Pattern 3: ? C ? A S
        Examples: 
            ""O C U A S"" -> ""OCUAS""? No.
            ""O C E A S"" -> has E -> invalid.
            ""O C T A S"" -> has T -> invalid.

        ""O C H A S"" -> ""OCHAS""? No.

        ""B C O A S"" -> ""BCOAS""? No.

        ""D C O A S"" -> ""DCOAS""? No.

        It seems hard to find words for patterns 2 and 3.

   So pattern 1: A C ? ? S -> ""ACIDS"" is a candidate.

   But note: we are testing C at position 2. We know from the first guess that C is in the word, but we don't know where. We are testing position 2 for C. If it's correct, we get a ✓, if not, we get a '-' and know it's elsewhere.

   Also, we are testing A at position 1.

   Alternatively, we can try to cover more letters? We have only tested 5 letters: C, R, A, N, E (first guess) and P, A, C, T, S (second). So we have not tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   We can try to include one of these to test.

   But ""ACIDS"" uses I and D. I is a vowel and D is a consonant.

   Another word: ""ACHOO"" -> but that doesn't end with S.

   We need the word to end with S.

   How about ""ACIDS"" or ""ACOES"" -> but has E? E is absent.

   So ""ACIDS"" is a good candidate.

   But wait: what about the possibility that A is at position 4 and C at position 2? We didn't find a good word for that pattern.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that tests A at position 4 and C at position 2? But we couldn't find a common word.

   Another word: ""A C K S"" -> but that's 4 letters? We need 5. ""ACKS"" is 4.

   How about ""A C T S"" -> but T is absent.

   So let's go with ""ACIDS"".

   But note: we are using C and A again, but that's okay because we are testing new positions.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't repeat the positions of A and C and also tests new letters.

   But ""ACIDS"" is one.

   Another word: ""SCALP"" -> but we know P is absent and also A is at position 3? We know A is not at position 3, so we shouldn't put A at 3.

   How about ""CAULK"" -> but doesn't end with S.

   We need the word to end with S.

   Another word: ""C A U S S"" -> duplicate S? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, A is at position 2? We know A is not at position 2 (from the second guess: A at position 2 was marked as '-'). So we cannot put A at position 2.

   Therefore, ""ACIDS"" is a good choice.

   But let me check: 
        Position 1: A -> testing A at position 1.
        Position 2: C -> testing C at position 2.
        Position 3: I -> new letter.
        Position 4: D -> new letter.
        Position 5: S -> known.

   We are testing two new letters: I and D.

   If the feedback shows:
        - If A is at position 1, we get ✓ for A.
        - If C is at position 2, we get ✓ for C.

   But we don't know if they are at these positions.

   Alternatively, we can try to test A at position 4 and C at position 2? But we need a word that fits _ C ? A S. We couldn't find one. 

   Another idea: what about ""O C E A S""? But has E -> invalid.

   How about ""O C T A S"" -> T is absent.

   So it seems that the only feasible pattern is A C ? ? S, with the middle two letters being new.

   Therefore, I choose ""ACIDS"".

   But wait: we know that in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and it was wrong, and in the second guess, A at position 2 was wrong. Now we are trying A at position 1. If it's correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know A must be at position 4 (since only positions 1 and 4 are left for A? Positions 1 and 4 are possible for A, and position 4 for C? But C can be at 2 or 4. 

   Actually, for A: we know it cannot be at 2 or 3. So only positions 1 and 4. 
   For C: it cannot be at 1 or 3. So positions 2 and 4.

   So if in ""ACIDS"", A is at 1 and C is at 2, then we are testing two possibilities at once.

   If A is at 1, then we get ✓ for A. If not, then A must be at 4.

   Similarly, if C is at 2, we get ✓ for C. If not, then C must be at 4.

   But note: if A is at 4 and C at 2, then in ""ACIDS"", A at 1 would be marked as '-' (if A is at 4) and C at 2 would be ✓? But we are also testing D at 4? Actually, in ""ACIDS"", the A is at 1, C at 2, and then I at 3, D at 4, S at 5.

   If the secret word has A at 4 and C at 2, then we would get:
        A at 1: '-' (because A is in the word but not at 1? But wait, if A is at 4, then A at 1 is not present? Actually, no: the feedback for A would be '-' meaning it's in the word but not at position 1. And C at 2 would be ✓.

   But that would tell us that A is at position 4? Not necessarily, because we have only one A? But the feedback doesn't specify how many A's? We don't know if there are duplicates.

   Actually, the feedback for ""p acts"" told us that A is in the word (marked '-') but we don't know if it's one or two. Similarly for C.

   However, in ""ACIDS"", we are testing A at 1 and C at 2. If the secret word has A at 4 and C at 2, then we would get:
        A at 1: '-' (because A is in the word but not at 1) -> but then we know A must be at 4 (since we know it's not at 1,2,3).
        C at 2: ✓ (because C is at 2 in the secret word) -> but wait, the secret word has C at 2, so ✓.
        Then I at 3: we don't know, but if the secret word has I, then ✓, else if I is absent, then x. But we are testing I.

   But if the secret word has A at 4 and C at 2, then in ""ACIDS"", we would get:
        A at 1: '-' -> because A is at 4? But we haven't tested position 4 for A? Actually, we are testing A at 1. If A is at 4, then we get '-' for A at 1 and then we know A is at 4.
        C at 2: ✓ -> because C is at 2 in the secret word.

   So we would get feedback: A(-), C(✓), I(?), D(?), S(✓). 

   But we would know that A is at 4? Not necessarily, because the feedback for A is '-' meaning it's in the word but not at 1, but we don't know where it is exactly. We would have to guess again.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests A at position 4 and C at position 2? But we couldn't find a common word.

   So maybe ""ACIDS"" is a reasonable guess.

   But note: we are testing C at position 2. We know C is in the word, but we don't know if it's at 2. If we get ✓ for C, then we know it's at 2. If we get '-', then C is not at 2 and must be at 4 (since only positions 2 and 4 are possible for C? Positions 2 and 4 are possible, but if we get '-' for C, then it must be at 4? Because we know C is not at 1 or 3, and 2 is the only other possibility? Actually, we have two positions: 2 and 4. If we put C at 2 and get ✓, then it's at 2. If we get '-', then it must be at 4.

   Similarly for A: if we put A at 1 and get ✓, then A is at 1. If we get '-', then A must be at 4.

   So ""ACIDS"" is testing two positions at once.

   But we are also testing I and D.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put A and C in the same position as the second guess? The second guess had A at 2 and C at 3, both wrong. Now we are trying A at 1 and C at 2. That's a new position for A (1) and for C (2). So that's good.

   Another candidate: ""CAVAS""? Not a word.

   How about ""MACHO""? 
        M at 1 (new)
        A at 2 -> but we know A is not at position 2! So we cannot put A at 2.

   So no.

   Another word: ""CIVIL"" -> doesn't end with S.

   So I think ""ACIDS"" is a good choice.

   But let me think of other words that fit the constraints.

   What about ""A C K S""? 4 letters.

   How about ""A C T S""? T is absent.

   Another word: ""A C E S""? E is absent.

   So ""ACIDS"" seems the best.

   However, note: we have S at the end, so we are sure about S.

   But wait: we know the secret word has C and A, and S at the end. We also know the word does not have R,N,E,P,T.

   We can also consider ""SCALY"" -> but Y is new, and we are testing Y. But ""SCALY"" has A at position 3? We know A is not at position 3. So we avoid.

   How about ""SCAMP""? 
        S at 1 -> but we know S is at the end? Actually, we know S is at position 5, but in ""SCAMP"", S is at position 1 and 5? That would be two S's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we are testing M and P? But P is absent.

   So no.

   Another word: ""CAULK"" -> doesn't end with S.

   So I think ""ACIDS"" is a valid choice.

   Therefore, I will guess ""ACIDS"".

   But note: we are using C and A again. We are also testing I and D.

   Alternatively, we can try a word that uses A and C in new positions and also tests other vowels? We haven't tested O or U.

   How about ""AUDIO""? But we must have C? We cannot skip C.

   Another word: ""CLOUD"" -> C at 1 -> not allowed.

   So I think ""ACIDS"" is the best.

   But let me double-check the feedback we have:

        We know:
          Position 5: S
          Letters in the word: A, C, S (and we think S is at the end, but we don't know for sure? Actually, we know S is at position 5, so S is definitely in the word and at the correct position.

        We don't know: 
          - If there are duplicate S? We haven't seen any duplicate feedback, so we assume no duplicates? But the feedback for S in the second guess was ✓, so we know S is at position 5 and nothing more.

        But in the first guess, we had S? No, the first guess had no S. The first guess was ""crane"": C,R,A,N,E. No S.

        So S is a new letter we tested in the second guess.

        Now, we are using S at the end.

        So ""ACIDS"" is a valid word.

   Let me write it: A C I D S

   But note: we are testing I and D. If the secret word has I and D, we get information.

   We might also consider ""SCUBA"" -> but doesn't end with S? It ends with A. We need to end with S.

   Another word: ""ACIDS"" is one.

   But wait: what about ""A C O S S""? Duplicate S? And ""ACOSS"" is not a word.

   How about ""A C K S"" -> 4 letters.

   So I think ""ACIDS"" is a good choice.

   Therefore, the third guess: ""ACIDS""

   But let me confirm the pattern:
        Position 1: A -> we are testing A at 1.
        Position 2: C -> testing C at 2.
        Position 3: I -> new letter.
        Position 4: D -> new letter.
        Position 5: S -> known.

   We are testing two new letters (I and D) and also testing A and C in new positions.

   If the feedback shows:
        - If A is at 1, we get ✓ for A.
        - If C is at 2, we get ✓ for C.
        - Then we might get information about I and D.

   But if the secret word has A at 4 and C at 2, then in ""ACIDS"":
        A at 1: '-' -> because A is at 4? But we haven't tested position 4 for A? Actually, we are testing A at 1. If A is at 4, then we get '-' meaning A is in the word but not at 1, and then we know A must be at 4 (since we know it's not at 1,2,3). Then C at 2: ✓? Because C is at 2 in the secret word? But we don't know that. We only know C is at 2 or 4. So if we get ✓ for C at 2, then we know C is at 2. If we get '-' for C at 2, then C must be at 4.

   So we are learning.

   Therefore, I choose ""ACIDS"".

   But note: we are testing A at position 1 and C at position 2. We know that in the secret word, C cannot be at 1 or 3, and A cannot be at 2 or 3. So position 1 for A is a new position, and position 2 for C is a new position.

   So let's go with that.

   Guess: ""ACIDS""

   Format: <guess>acids</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: C is in the word but not position 1 (-), R/N/E are absent (x), A is in the word but not position 3 (-).
- **Guess 2 (pacts)**: P is absent (x), A is in the word but not position 2 (-), C is in the word but not position 3 (-), T is absent (x), S is correct at position 5 (✓).

### Key Insights:
1. **S is fixed at position 5**.
2. **A and C are present** but mispositioned:
   - A cannot be at positions 2 or 3 → must be at position 1 or 4.
   - C cannot be at positions 1 or 3 → must be at position 2 or 4.
3. **Absent letters**: R, N, E, P, T.
4. The secret word pattern: `_ _ _ _ S`.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test **A at position 1** and **C at position 2** (new positions for both).
- Introduce **new letters** to gather more information (choosing common consonants like D and I).
- Avoid absent letters (R,N,E,P,T) and forbidden positions for A/C.

**Chosen word: ""ACIDS""**  
- A at position 1 (tests if A is at start/end)  
- C at position 2 (tests if C is in middle)  
- I at position 3 (new vowel)  
- D at position 4 (new consonant)  
- S at position 5 (confirmed)  

This guess efficiently tests new positions for A/C while probing new letters (I, D) and leveraging known S at end.",Guess 4: acids -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) C(✓) I(✓) D(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
