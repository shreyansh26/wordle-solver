 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word ends with E.
 - The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"" it was in the second position and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
 - The letters C, A, N are not in the word.

 Since E is at the end, we can think of words ending with E.

 Also, note that R is present but not in the second position. Since the first position was C (which is absent) and the second was R (misplaced), R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 5 is E, so R cannot be there. So R must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

 We have 6 tries, so we want to make a guess that uses common letters and avoids C, A, N.

 Let's think of words ending with E that have R in them (but not in the second position) and without C, A, N.

 Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Common consonants besides R: S, T, L, etc. Common vowels: O, I, U (but we already know A is absent, so avoid A).

 Since E is fixed at the end, we can try a word that has R in the first position? Or third? 

 Let me list possible words: 
 - Words ending with E: many possibilities.

 We can try to use a word that has R and also includes other common letters we haven't tried yet, such as T, L, S, O, I, etc.

 Avoid letters: C, A, N.

 We have already used: C, R, A, N, E. So we should avoid repeating C, A, N (since they are absent) and reuse E at the end.

 But note: the feedback tells us that E is present and in the correct position, so we can keep E at the end.

 So the new guess should have:
 - E at the fifth position.
 - R somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but not 2, and 5 is E so not 5).
 - And we should avoid C, A, N.

 We want to cover new letters. Let's try to include other common letters.

 Example: we could try ""PRIDE"": 
   P, R, I, D, E.
   But note: we have E at the end, which is good.

 However, we must check if R is in the correct position? In ""crane"", R was in position 2 and got '-', meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. In ""PRIDE"", R is in position 2 again? That would be the same position. So we should avoid putting R in position 2.

 Therefore, in ""PRIDE"", R is in position 2. We know from feedback that R is not in position 2, so we should avoid that.

 How about ""SPIRE""? 
   S, P, I, R, E -> R is in position 4, which is good (not position 2). And E at the end.

 But note: we don't know if S, P, I are in the word. Also, we avoid A, C, N.

 Alternatively, we could try ""SHIRE"": 
   S, H, I, R, E -> R in position 4.

 Or ""TIRED"": 
   T, I, R, E, D -> but note that E is at position 4? We need E at position 5. So ""TIRED"" has E at position 4, which is not the same as position 5. So that would be incorrect.

 We need a word with E at the end (position 5).

 Words: 
   ...E

 Let me think of common words: 
   ""STORE"": S, T, O, R, E -> R is in position 4? Yes, position 4 is R and position 5 is E. Also, we avoid A, C, N.

 But note: we have to consider that R was misplaced in position 2, so if we put R in position 4, that might be correct.

 However, we don't know if S, T, O are in the word.

 Another idea: we know E is at the end, so we can try to find words that have R and end with E.

 Let me list a few: 
   ""PRICE"" -> but C is absent (we know C is not in the word) so we cannot use C.
   ""BRIDE"" -> B, R, I, D, E -> R is in position 2? In ""BRIDE"", R is in position 2. We must avoid position 2 for R.

 So let's avoid position 2 for R.

 How about ""TRIBE"": 
   T, R, I, B, E -> R is in position 2? Again position 2.

 How about ""DRIVE"": 
   D, R, I, V, E -> R is in position 2? Same.

 We need R in position 1, 3, or 4.

 Position 1: R? 
   Example: ""ROUSE"" -> R, O, U, S, E -> R at position 1, E at 5. But we don't know if O, U, S are present.

 Position 3: 
   Example: ""PARSE"" -> but A is absent, so we cannot use A.
   ""TERSE"": T, E, R, S, E -> but E is repeated? And we have E at position 2 and 5? The word ""TERSE"" is valid? Yes. But note: we have E at position 2 and 5. However, we know E is at position 5, but we don't know about position 2. Also, we are allowed to have multiple E's? The feedback didn't say anything about multiple E's. But in the first guess, we had only one E and it was correct. So the word might have only one E? Or multiple? We don't know.

 However, we can try ""TERSE"", but it has E at position 2 and 5. Since we know E is at 5, and we don't know about 2, it might be acceptable.

 But note: we are avoiding A, C, N. ""TERSE"" doesn't have A, C, N.

 Position 4: 
   Example: ""STORE"" as above.

 Let me choose ""STORE"": 
   S, T, O, R, E -> positions: 
      1: S
      2: T
      3: O
      4: R
      5: E

 This puts R in position 4, which is a new position. We hope to get feedback on R's position.

 Also, we test S, T, O.

 Alternatively, we could try ""ROUSE"": 
   R, O, U, S, E -> R at position 1, E at 5.

 But note: we have E at the end, which is good.

 However, we must avoid using letters we know are absent: C, A, N. Both ""STORE"" and ""ROUSE"" are free of C, A, N.

 Another common word: ""PRIDE"" is no good because R is in position 2.

 How about ""TRICE""? But C is absent, so no.

 ""BRINE""? But N is absent (we got N: x in first guess) so we cannot use N.

 ""DRIVE"": R is in position 2? Yes, same as before.

 Let me try to find words with R in position 1, 3, or 4.

 Position 1: 
   ""ROUSE"": R, O, U, S, E -> good.
   ""RAISE"": but A is absent, so avoid.
   ""ROUTE"": R, O, U, T, E -> good.

 Position 3:
   ""PARSE"": has A -> avoid.
   ""TERSE"": T, E, R, S, E -> but E at position 2: we don't know if that E is in the word? But we are allowed to guess. However, we are trying to get information.

   But note: if the secret word has only one E, then the E at position 2 in ""TERSE"" would be incorrect. But we don't know. However, we are trying to test multiple letters.

   Alternatively, ""BERET"": B, E, R, E, T -> but E at position 2 and 4? And we have E at 5? Actually, ""BERET"" is 5 letters: B-E-R-E-T -> so E at 2 and 4, and T at 5? But we need E at 5. So that doesn't work.

   ""INCUR""? Doesn't end with E.

   It's challenging to find words with R in position 3 and E at the end.

   Position 4: 
   ""STORE"" (as above) -> S-T-O-R-E.

   ""SHIRE"": S-H-I-R-E -> R at position 4.

   ""SPIRE"": S-P-I-R-E -> R at position 4.

   ""SNARE""? But N and A are absent.

   So let's choose between ""ROUSE"", ""STORE"", ""SHIRE"", ""SPIRE"".

 We want to maximize new letters. 

 In ""ROUSE"": letters R, O, U, S, E (we know E is at the end, and we are testing O, U, S).
 In ""STORE"": letters S, T, O, R, E (testing S, T, O).
 In ""SHIRE"": letters S, H, I, R, E (testing S, H, I).
 In ""SPIRE"": letters S, P, I, R, E (testing S, P, I).

 We also know that R is present, so we are trying to find its position.

 Since we have limited tries, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 Let's compare:
   ""ROUSE"": tests O, U, S -> U is less common.
   ""STORE"": tests S, T, O -> S, T, O are common.
   ""SHIRE"": tests S, H, I -> H and I are common.
   ""SPIRE"": tests S, P, I -> P and I are common.

 Among the letters, S is common in many words. So both ""STORE"" and ""SPIRE"" test S.

 But note: we have 5 more letters to test. We want to eliminate as many possibilities as possible.

 I think ""STORE"" is a good candidate because it tests S, T, O (common letters) and we have R in a new position (4) and E at the end.

 Alternatively, we could try ""ROUSE"" to test U? But U is less common.

 Another idea: we know the word has R and ends with E. What about ""RINSE""? But N is absent, so no.

 ""RIPES"": R, I, P, E, S -> but E is at position 4? Then S at 5? But we need E at 5. So ""RIPES"" ends with S, not E.

 We need the word to end with E.

 Let me check: 
   ""RANGE"" -> but A and N are absent.
   ""ROBES"" -> R, O, B, E, S -> ends with S? No.

   ""REVUE""? Not ending with E.

   ""RULER""? Ends with R.

   ""RIFLE"": R, I, F, L, E -> ends with E? Yes, and R at position 1. Also, avoids A, C, N.

   ""RIFLE"": R at 1, I at 2, F at 3, L at 4, E at 5.

   But we know that R is in the word, and we are putting it at position 1. If the secret word has R at position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know R is present, so if it's not at 1, we get a minus.

   Also, we test I, F, L.

   Compare to ""STORE"": 
      ""STORE"": tests S (common), T (common), O (common), R (we know is present), E (known).
      ""RIFLE"": tests R at 1 (new position), I, F, L, E.

   Both are valid.

   But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was misplaced. So if we put R at position 1 and it's correct, that would be great. If not, then we know R is not at 1.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put R in the first position because we don't know if it's at 1.

   How about ""PRICE""? But C is absent.

   Another word: ""TRICE"" -> C absent.

   ""BRINE"" -> N absent.

   ""DRIVE"": R at position 2? No, in ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> R is at position 2. We must avoid position 2 for R.

   So we cannot use words with R in position 2.

   Therefore, ""RIFLE"" is a candidate: R at 1, I at 2, F at 3, L at 4, E at 5.

   But note: we don't know if the word has I, F, L.

   Another candidate: ""ROUSE"": R at 1, O at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

   We haven't tested O, U, S.

   ""STORE"": S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5.

   This tests S, T, O.

   Since S and T are very common, I think ""STORE"" is a good choice.

   But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

   I'll go with ""STORE"".

   Why? 
   - It tests three new common letters: S, T, O.
   - It places R in a new position (4) which we hope might be correct.
   - And it ends with E.

   So let's guess ""STORE"".

   If the feedback shows:
      If R is correct at position 4, we get a check for R.
      Otherwise, if R is present but not at 4, we get a minus.

   Also, we get information about S, T, O.

   Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't put R in the first position because we don't know if it's at 1. But by putting it at 4, we are testing a middle position.

   Another candidate: ""PRIDE"" is no good because R is at 2.

   How about ""TRICE""? Avoid C.

   ""ROGUE"": R at 1, O at 2, G at 3, U at 4, E at 5 -> but we haven't tested G and U.

   But ""STORE"" tests S, T, O.

   I think ""STORE"" is a solid choice.

   So the next guess: ""STORE""

   We'll see what feedback we get.

   But note: we are not forced to put R in the first position. We are just trying to get information.

   Alternatively, we could try a word that has R in a position we haven't tried (like 1 or 3) and also includes other common letters.

   Let me check if ""STORE"" is valid: yes.

   So I'll go with ""STORE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **E** is correct and in position 5 (so the secret word ends with `E`).
- **R** is in the word but not in position 2.
- **C**, **A**, and **N** are absent (cannot be used).

For the next guess:
- Must end with `E` (position 5).
- Must include `R` but not in position 2.
- Avoid `C`, `A`, `N`.
- Test new common letters (e.g., `S`, `T`, `O`) to gather more information.

I chose **""STORE""** because:
- It ends with `E`.
- Places `R` in position 4 (a new position to test).
- Introduces `S`, `T`, `O` (common letters).
- Avoids forbidden letters (`C`, `A`, `N`).

 But note: we are avoiding A, C, N. ""TERSE"" doesn't have A, C, N.

 Position 4: 
   Example: ""STORE"" as above.

 Let me choose ""STORE"": 
   S, T, O, R, E -> positions: 
      1: S
      2: T
      3: O
      4: R
      5: E

 This puts R in position 4, which is a new position. We hope to get feedback on R's position.

 Also, we test S, T, O.

 Alternatively, we could try ""ROUSE"": 
   R, O, U, S, E -> R at position 1, E at 5.

 But note: we have E at the end, which is good.

 However, we must avoid using letters we know are absent: C, A, N. Both ""STORE"" and ""ROUSE"" are free of C, A, N.

 Another common word: ""PRIDE"" is no good because R is in position 2.

 How about ""TRICE""? But C is absent, so no.

 ""BRINE""? But N is absent (we got N: x in first guess) so we cannot use N.

 ""DRIVE"": R is in position 2? Yes, same as before.

 Let me try to find words with R in position 1, 3, or 4.

 Position 1: 
   ""ROUSE"": R, O, U, S, E -> good.
   ""RAISE"": but A is absent, so avoid.
   ""ROUTE"": R, O, U, T, E -> good.

 Position 3:
   ""PARSE"": has A -> avoid.
   ""TERSE"": T, E, R, S, E -> but E at position 2: we don't know if that E is in the word? But we are allowed to guess. However, we are trying to get information.

   But note: if the secret word has only one E, then the E at position 2 in ""TERSE"" would be incorrect. But we don't know. However, we are trying to test multiple letters.

   Alternatively, ""BERET"": B, E, R, E, T -> but E at position 2 and 4? And we have E at 5? Actually, ""BERET"" is 5 letters: B-E-R-E-T -> so E at 2 and 4, and T at 5? But we need E at 5. So that doesn't work.

   ""INCUR""? Doesn't end with E.

   It's challenging to find words with R in position 3 and E at the end.

   Position 4: 
   ""STORE"" (as above) -> S-T-O-R-E.

   ""SHIRE"": S-H-I-R-E -> R at position 4.

   ""SPIRE"": S-P-I-R-E -> R at position 4.

   ""SNARE""? But N and A are absent.

   So let's choose between ""ROUSE"", ""STORE"", ""SHIRE"", ""SPIRE"".

 We want to maximize new letters. 

 In ""ROUSE"": letters R, O, U, S, E (we know E is at the end, and we are testing O, U, S).
 In ""STORE"": letters S, T, O, R, E (testing S, T, O).
 In ""SHIRE"": letters S, H, I, R, E (testing S, H, I).
 In ""SPIRE"": letters S, P, I, R, E (testing S, P, I).

 We also know that R is present, so we are trying to find its position.

 Since we have limited tries, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 Let's compare:
   ""ROUSE"": tests O, U, S -> U is less common.
   ""STORE"": tests S, T, O -> S, T, O are common.
   ""SHIRE"": tests S, H, I -> H and I are common.
   ""SPIRE"": tests S, P, I -> P and I are common.

 Among the letters, S is common in many words. So both ""STORE"" and ""SPIRE"" test S.

 But note: we have 5 more letters to test. We want to eliminate as many possibilities as possible.

 I think ""STORE"" is a good candidate because it tests S, T, O (common letters) and we have R in a new position (4) and E at the end.

 Alternatively, we could try ""ROUSE"" to test U? But U is less common.

 Another idea: we know the word has R and ends with E. What about ""RINSE""? But N is absent, so no.

 ""RIPES"": R, I, P, E, S -> but E is at position 4? Then S at 5? But we need E at 5. So ""RIPES"" ends with S, not E.

 We need the word to end with E.

 Let me check: 
   ""RANGE"" -> but A and N are absent.
   ""ROBES"" -> R, O, B, E, S -> ends with S? No.

   ""REVUE""? Not ending with E.

   ""RULER""? Ends with R.

   ""RIFLE"": R, I, F, L, E -> ends with E? Yes, and R at position 1. Also, avoids A, C, N.

   ""RIFLE"": R at 1, I at 2, F at 3, L at 4, E at 5.

   But we know that R is in the word, and we are putting it at position 1. If the secret word has R at position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know R is present, so if it's not at 1, we get a minus.

   Also, we test I, F, L.

   Compare to ""STORE"": 
      ""STORE"": tests S (common), T (common), O (common), R (we know is present), E (known).
      ""RIFLE"": tests R at 1 (new position), I, F, L, E.

   Both are valid.

   But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was misplaced. So if we put R at position 1 and it's correct, that would be great. If not, then we know R is not at 1.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put R in the first position because we don't know if it's at 1.

   How about ""PRICE""? But C is absent.

   Another word: ""TRICE"" -> C absent.

   ""BRINE"" -> N absent.

   ""DRIVE"": R at position 2? No, in ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> R is at position 2. We must avoid position 2 for R.

   So we cannot use words with R in position 2.

   Therefore, ""RIFLE"" is a candidate: R at 1, I at 2, F at 3, L at 4, E at 5.

   But note: we don't know if the word has I, F, L.

   Another candidate: ""ROUSE"": R at 1, O at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

   We haven't tested O, U, S.

   ""STORE"": S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5.

   This tests S, T, O.

   Since S and T are very common, I think ""STORE"" is a good choice.

   But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

   I'll go with ""STORE"".

   Why? 
   - It tests three new common letters: S, T, O.
   - It places R in a new position (4) which we hope might be correct.
   - And it ends with E.

   So let's guess ""STORE"".

   If the feedback shows:
      If R is correct at position 4, we get a check for R.
      Otherwise, if R is present but not at 4, we get a minus.

   Also, we get information about S, T, O.

   Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't put R in the first position because we don't know if it's at 1. But by putting it at 4, we are testing a middle position.

   Another candidate: ""PRIDE"" is no good because R is at 2.

   How about ""TRICE""? Avoid C.

   ""ROGUE"": R at 1, O at 2, G at 3, U at 4, E at 5 -> but we haven't tested G and U.

   But ""STORE"" tests S, T, O.

   I think ""STORE"" is a solid choice.

   So the next guess: ""STORE""

   We'll see what feedback we get.

   But note: we are not forced to put R in the first position. We are just trying to get information.

   Alternatively, we could try a word that has R in a position we haven't tried (like 1 or 3) and also includes other common letters.

   Let me check if ""STORE"" is valid: yes.

   So I'll go with ""STORE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **E** is correct and in position 5 (so the secret word ends with `E`).
- **R** is in the word but not in position 2.
- **C**, **A**, and **N** are absent (cannot be used).

For the next guess:
- Must end with `E` (position 5).
- Must include `R` but not in position 2.
- Avoid `C`, `A`, `N`.
- Test new common letters (e.g., `S`, `T`, `O`) to gather more information.

I chose **""STORE""** because:
- It ends with `E`.
- Places `R` in position 4 (a new position to test).
- Introduces `S`, `T`, `O` (common letters).
- Avoids forbidden letters (`C`, `A`, `N`).",Guess 2: store -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(✓) R(-) E(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The secret word ends with E.
 - The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"" it was in the second position and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
 - The letters C, A, N are not in the word.

 Since E is at the end, we can think of words ending with E.

 Also, note that R is present but not in the second position. Since the first position was C (which is absent) and the second was R (misplaced), R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 5 is E, so R cannot be there. So R must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

 We have 6 tries, so we want to make a guess that uses common letters and avoids C, A, N.

 Let's think of words ending with E that have R in them (but not in the second position) and without C, A, N.

 Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Common consonants besides R: S, T, L, etc. Common vowels: O, I, U (but we already know A is absent, so avoid A).

 Since E is fixed at the end, we can try a word that has R in the first position? Or third? 

 Let me list possible words: 
 - Words ending with E: many possibilities.

 We can try to use a word that has R and also includes other common letters we haven't tried yet, such as T, L, S, O, I, etc.

 Avoid letters: C, A, N.

 We have already used: C, R, A, N, E. So we should avoid repeating C, A, N (since they are absent) and reuse E at the end.

 But note: the feedback tells us that E is present and in the correct position, so we can keep E at the end.

 So the new guess should have:
 - E at the fifth position.
 - R somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but not 2, and 5 is E so not 5).
 - And we should avoid C, A, N.

 We want to cover new letters. Let's try to include other common letters.

 Example: we could try ""PRIDE"": 
   P, R, I, D, E.
   But note: we have E at the end, which is good.

 However, we must check if R is in the correct position? In ""crane"", R was in position 2 and got '-', meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. In ""PRIDE"", R is in position 2 again? That would be the same position. So we should avoid putting R in position 2.

 Therefore, in ""PRIDE"", R is in position 2. We know from feedback that R is not in position 2, so we should avoid that.

 How about ""SPIRE""? 
   S, P, I, R, E -> R is in position 4, which is good (not position 2). And E at the end.

 But note: we don't know if S, P, I are in the word. Also, we avoid A, C, N.

 Alternatively, we could try ""SHIRE"": 
   S, H, I, R, E -> R in position 4.

 Or ""TIRED"": 
   T, I, R, E, D -> but note that E is at position 4? We need E at position 5. So ""TIRED"" has E at position 4, which is not the same as position 5. So that would be incorrect.

 We need a word with E at the end (position 5).

 Words: 
   ...E

 Let me think of common words: 
   ""STORE"": S, T, O, R, E -> R is in position 4? Yes, position 4 is R and position 5 is E. Also, we avoid A, C, N.

 But note: we have to consider that R was misplaced in position 2, so if we put R in position 4, that might be correct.

 However, we don't know if S, T, O are in the word.

 Another idea: we know E is at the end, so we can try to find words that have R and end with E.

 Let me list a few: 
   ""PRICE"" -> but C is absent (we know C is not in the word) so we cannot use C.
   ""BRIDE"" -> B, R, I, D, E -> R is in position 2? In ""BRIDE"", R is in position 2. We must avoid position 2 for R.

 So let's avoid position 2 for R.

 How about ""TRIBE"": 
   T, R, I, B, E -> R is in position 2? Again position 2.

 How about ""DRIVE"": 
   D, R, I, V, E -> R is in position 2? Same.

 We need R in position 1, 3, or 4.

 Position 1: R? 
   Example: ""ROUSE"" -> R, O, U, S, E -> R at position 1, E at 5. But we don't know if O, U, S are present.

 Position 3: 
   Example: ""PARSE"" -> but A is absent, so we cannot use A.
   ""TERSE"": T, E, R, S, E -> but E is repeated? And we have E at position 2 and 5? The word ""TERSE"" is valid? Yes. But note: we have E at position 2 and 5. However, we know E is at position 5, but we don't know about position 2. Also, we are allowed to have multiple E's? The feedback didn't say anything about multiple E's. But in the first guess, we had only one E and it was correct. So the word might have only one E? Or multiple? We don't know.

 However, we can try ""TERSE"", but it has E at position 2 and 5. Since we know E is at 5, and we don't know about 2, it might be acceptable.

 But note: we are avoiding A, C, N. ""TERSE"" doesn't have A, C, N.

 Position 4: 
   Example: ""STORE"" as above.

 Let me choose ""STORE"": 
   S, T, O, R, E -> positions: 
      1: S
      2: T
      3: O
      4: R
      5: E

 This puts R in position 4, which is a new position. We hope to get feedback on R's position.

 Also, we test S, T, O.

 Alternatively, we could try ""ROUSE"": 
   R, O, U, S, E -> R at position 1, E at 5.

 But note: we have E at the end, which is good.

 However, we must avoid using letters we know are absent: C, A, N. Both ""STORE"" and ""ROUSE"" are free of C, A, N.

 Another common word: ""PRIDE"" is no good because R is in position 2.

 How about ""TRICE""? But C is absent, so no.

 ""BRINE""? But N is absent (we got N: x in first guess) so we cannot use N.

 ""DRIVE"": R is in position 2? Yes, same as before.

 Let me try to find words with R in position 1, 3, or 4.

 Position 1: 
   ""ROUSE"": R, O, U, S, E -> good.
   ""RAISE"": but A is absent, so avoid.
   ""ROUTE"": R, O, U, T, E -> good.

 Position 3:
   ""PARSE"": has A -> avoid.
   ""TERSE"": T, E, R, S, E -> but E at position 2: we don't know if that E is in the word? But we are allowed to guess. However, we are trying to get information.

   But note: if the secret word has only one E, then the E at position 2 in ""TERSE"" would be incorrect. But we don't know. However, we are trying to test multiple letters.

   Alternatively, ""BERET"": B, E, R, E, T -> but E at position 2 and 4? And we have E at 5? Actually, ""BERET"" is 5 letters: B-E-R-E-T -> so E at 2 and 4, and T at 5? But we need E at 5. So that doesn't work.

   ""INCUR""? Doesn't end with E.

   It's challenging to find words with R in position 3 and E at the end.

   Position 4: 
   ""STORE"" (as above) -> S-T-O-R-E.

   ""SHIRE"": S-H-I-R-E -> R at position 4.

   ""SPIRE"": S-P-I-R-E -> R at position 4.

   ""SNARE""? But N and A are absent.

   So let's choose between ""ROUSE"", ""STORE"", ""SHIRE"", ""SPIRE"".

 We want to maximize new letters. 

 In ""ROUSE"": letters R, O, U, S, E (we know E is at the end, and we are testing O, U, S).
 In ""STORE"": letters S, T, O, R, E (testing S, T, O).
 In ""SHIRE"": letters S, H, I, R, E (testing S, H, I).
 In ""SPIRE"": letters S, P, I, R, E (testing S, P, I).

 We also know that R is present, so we are trying to find its position.

 Since we have limited tries, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 Let's compare:
   ""ROUSE"": tests O, U, S -> U is less common.
   ""STORE"": tests S, T, O -> S, T, O are common.
   ""SHIRE"": tests S, H, I -> H and I are common.
   ""SPIRE"": tests S, P, I -> P and I are common.

 Among the letters, S is common in many words. So both ""STORE"" and ""SPIRE"" test S.

 But note: we have 5 more letters to test. We want to eliminate as many possibilities as possible.

 I think ""STORE"" is a good candidate because it tests S, T, O (common letters) and we have R in a new position (4) and E at the end.

 Alternatively, we could try ""ROUSE"" to test U? But U is less common.

 Another idea: we know the word has R and ends with E. What about ""RINSE""? But N is absent, so no.

 ""RIPES"": R, I, P, E, S -> but E is at position 4? Then S at 5? But we need E at 5. So ""RIPES"" ends with S, not E.

 We need the word to end with E.

 Let me check: 
   ""RANGE"" -> but A and N are absent.
   ""ROBES"" -> R, O, B, E, S -> ends with S? No.

   ""REVUE""? Not ending with E.

   ""RULER""? Ends with R.

   ""RIFLE"": R, I, F, L, E -> ends with E? Yes, and R at position 1. Also, avoids A, C, N.

   ""RIFLE"": R at 1, I at 2, F at 3, L at 4, E at 5.

   But we know that R is in the word, and we are putting it at position 1. If the secret word has R at position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know R is present, so if it's not at 1, we get a minus.

   Also, we test I, F, L.

   Compare to ""STORE"": 
      ""STORE"": tests S (common), T (common), O (common), R (we know is present), E (known).
      ""RIFLE"": tests R at 1 (new position), I, F, L, E.

   Both are valid.

   But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was misplaced. So if we put R at position 1 and it's correct, that would be great. If not, then we know R is not at 1.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put R in the first position because we don't know if it's at 1.

   How about ""PRICE""? But C is absent.

   Another word: ""TRICE"" -> C absent.

   ""BRINE"" -> N absent.

   ""DRIVE"": R at position 2? No, in ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> R is at position 2. We must avoid position 2 for R.

   So we cannot use words with R in position 2.

   Therefore, ""RIFLE"" is a candidate: R at 1, I at 2, F at 3, L at 4, E at 5.

   But note: we don't know if the word has I, F, L.

   Another candidate: ""ROUSE"": R at 1, O at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5.

   We haven't tested O, U, S.

   ""STORE"": S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5.

   This tests S, T, O.

   Since S and T are very common, I think ""STORE"" is a good choice.

   But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far.

   I'll go with ""STORE"".

   Why? 
   - It tests three new common letters: S, T, O.
   - It places R in a new position (4) which we hope might be correct.
   - And it ends with E.

   So let's guess ""STORE"".

   If the feedback shows:
      If R is correct at position 4, we get a check for R.
      Otherwise, if R is present but not at 4, we get a minus.

   Also, we get information about S, T, O.

   Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't put R in the first position because we don't know if it's at 1. But by putting it at 4, we are testing a middle position.

   Another candidate: ""PRIDE"" is no good because R is at 2.

   How about ""TRICE""? Avoid C.

   ""ROGUE"": R at 1, O at 2, G at 3, U at 4, E at 5 -> but we haven't tested G and U.

   But ""STORE"" tests S, T, O.

   I think ""STORE"" is a solid choice.

   So the next guess: ""STORE""

   We'll see what feedback we get.

   But note: we are not forced to put R in the first position. We are just trying to get information.

   Alternatively, we could try a word that has R in a position we haven't tried (like 1 or 3) and also includes other common letters.

   Let me check if ""STORE"" is valid: yes.

   So I'll go with ""STORE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **E** is correct and in position 5 (so the secret word ends with `E`).
- **R** is in the word but not in position 2.
- **C**, **A**, and **N** are absent (cannot be used).

For the next guess:
- Must end with `E` (position 5).
- Must include `R` but not in position 2.
- Avoid `C`, `A`, `N`.
- Test new common letters (e.g., `S`, `T`, `O`) to gather more information.

I chose **""STORE""** because:
- It ends with `E`.
- Places `R` in position 4 (a new position to test).
- Introduces `S`, `T`, `O` (common letters).
- Avoids forbidden letters (`C`, `A`, `N`).

Since the first position was C (which is absent) and the second was R (misplaced), R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5? But position 5 is E, so R cannot be there. So R must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\n We have 6 tries, so we want to make a guess that uses common letters and avoids C, A, N.\n\n Let\'s think of words ending with E that have R in them (but not in the second position) and without C, A, N.\n\n Also, we want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\n Common consonants besides R: S, T, L, etc. Common vowels: O, I, U (but we already know A is absent, so avoid A).\n\n Since E is fixed at the end, we can try a word that has R in the first position? Or third? \n\n Let me list possible words: \n - Words ending with E: many possibilities.\n\n We can try to use a word that has R and also includes other common letters we haven\'t tried yet, such as T, L, S, O, I, etc.\n\n Avoid letters: C, A, N.\n\n We have already used: C, R, A, N, E. So we should avoid repeating C, A, N (since they are absent) and reuse E at the end.\n\n But note: the feedback tells us that E is present and in the correct position, so we can keep E at the end.\n\n So the new guess should have:\n - E at the fifth position.\n - R somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4 (but not 2, and 5 is E so not 5).\n - And we should avoid C, A, N.\n\n We want to cover new letters. Let\'s try to include other common letters.\n\n Example: we could try ""PRIDE"": \n   P, R, I, D, E.\n   But note: we have E at the end, which is good.\n\n However, we must check if R is in the correct position? In ""crane"", R was in position 2 and got \'-\', meaning R is in the word but not in position 2. In ""PRIDE"", R is in position 2 again? That would be the same position. So we should avoid putting R in position 2.\n\n Therefore, in ""PRIDE"", R is in position 2. We know from feedback that R is not in position 2, so we should avoid that.\n\n How about ""SPIRE""? \n   S, P, I, R, E -> R is in position 4, which is good (not position 2). And E at the end.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if S, P, I are in the word.

We need E at position 5. So ""TIRED"" has E at position 4, which is not the same as position 5. So that would be incorrect.\n\n We need a word with E at the end (position 5).\n\n Words: \n   ...E\n\n Let me think of common words: \n   ""STORE"": S, T, O, R, E -> R is in position 4? Yes, position 4 is R and position 5 is E. Also, we avoid A, C, N.\n\n But note: we have to consider that R was misplaced in position 2, so if we put R in position 4, that might be correct.\n\n However, we don\'t know if S, T, O are in the word.\n\n Another idea: we know E is at the end, so we can try to find words that have R and end with E.\n\n Let me list a few: \n   ""PRICE"" -> but C is absent (we know C is not in the word) so we cannot use C.\n   ""BRIDE"" -> B, R, I, D, E -> R is in position 2? In ""BRIDE"", R is in position 2. We must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n So let\'s avoid position 2 for R.\n\n How about ""TRIBE"": \n   T, R, I, B, E -> R is in position 2? Again position 2.\n\n How about ""DRIVE"": \n   D, R, I, V, E -> R is in position 2? Same.\n\n We need R in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\n Position 1: R? \n   Example: ""ROUSE"" -> R, O, U, S, E -> R at position 1, E at 5. But we don\'t know if O, U, S are present.\n\n Position 3: \n   Example: ""PARSE"" -> but A is absent, so we cannot use A.\n   ""TERSE"": T, E, R, S, E -> but E is repeated? And we have E at position 2 and 5? The word ""TERSE"" is valid? Yes. But note: we have E at position 2 and 5. However, we know E is at position 5, but we don\'t know about position 2. Also, we are allowed to have multiple E\'s? The feedback didn\'t say anything about multiple E\'s. But in the first guess, we had only one E and it was correct. So the word might have only one E? Or multiple? We don\'t know.\n\n However, we can try ""TERSE"", but it has E at position 2 and 5. Since we know E is at 5, and we don\'t know about 2, it might be acceptable.\n\n But note: we are avoiding A, C, N. ""TERSE"" doesn\'t have A, C, N.\n\n Position 4: \n   Example: ""STORE"" as above.\n\n Let me choose ""STORE"": \n   S, T, O, R, E -> positions: \n      1: S\n      2: T\n      3: O\n      4: R\n      5: E\n\n This puts R in position 4, which is a new position. We hope to get feedback on R\'s position.\n\n Also, we test S, T, O.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""ROUSE"": \n   R, O, U, S, E -> R at position 1, E at 5.\n\n But note: we have E at the end, which is good.\n\n However, we must avoid using letters we know are absent: C, A, N. Both ""STORE"" and ""ROUSE"" are free of C, A, N.\n\n Another common word: ""PRIDE"" is no good because R is in position 2.\n\n How about ""TRICE""? But C is absent, so no.\n\n ""BRINE""? But N is absent (we got N: x in first guess) so we cannot use N.\n\n ""DRIVE"": R is in position 2? Yes, same as before.\n\n Let me try to find words with R in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\n Position 1: \n   ""ROUSE"": R, O, U, S, E -> good.\n   ""RAISE"": but A is absent, so avoid.\n   ""ROUTE"": R, O, U, T, E -> good.\n\n Position 3:\n   ""PARSE"": has A -> avoid.\n   ""TERSE"": T, E, R, S, E -> but E at position 2: we don\'t know if that E is in the word? But we are allowed to guess. However, we are trying to get information.\n\n   But note: if the secret word has only one E, then the E at position 2 in ""TERSE"" would be incorrect. But we don\'t know. However, we are trying to test multiple letters.\n\n   Alternatively, ""BERET"": B, E, R, E, T -> but E at position 2 and 4? And we have E at 5? Actually, ""BERET"" is 5 letters: B-E-R-E-T -> so E at 2 and 4, and T at 5? But we need E at 5. So that doesn\'t work.\n\n   ""INCUR""? Doesn\'t end with E.\n\n   It\'s challenging to find words with R in position 3 and E at the end.\n\n   Position 4: \n   ""STORE"" (as above) -> S-T-O-R-E.\n\n   ""SHIRE"": S-H-I-R-E -> R at position 4.\n\n   ""SPIRE"": S-P-I-R-E -> R at position 4.\n\n   ""SNARE""? But N and A are absent.\n\n   So let\'s choose between ""ROUSE"", ""STORE"", ""SHIRE"", ""SPIRE"".\n\n We want to maximize new letters. \n\n In ""ROUSE"": letters R, O, U, S, E (we know E is at the end, and we are testing O, U, S).\n In ""STORE"": letters S, T, O, R, E (testing S, T, O).\n In ""SHIRE"": letters S, H, I, R, E (testing S, H, I).\n In ""SPIRE"": letters S, P, I, R, E (testing S, P, I).\n\n We also know that R is present, so we are trying to find its position.\n\n Since we have limited tries, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\n Let\'s compare:\n   ""ROUSE"": tests O, U, S -> U is less common.\n   ""STORE"": tests S, T, O -> S, T, O are common.\n   ""SHIRE"": tests S, H, I -> H and I are common.\n   ""SPIRE"": tests S, P, I -> P and I are common.\n\n Among the letters, S is common in many words. So both ""STORE"" and ""SPIRE"" test S.\n\n But note: we have 5 more letters to test. We want to eliminate as many possibilities as possible.\n\n I think ""STORE"" is a good candidate because it tests S, T, O (common letters) and we have R in a new position (4) and E at the end.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""ROUSE"" to test U? But U is less common.\n\n Another idea: we know the word has R and ends with E. What about ""RINSE""? But N is absent, so no.\n\n ""RIPES"": R, I, P, E, S -> but E is at position 4? Then S at 5? But we need E at 5. So ""RIPES"" ends with S, not E.\n\n We need the word to end with E.\n\n Let me check: \n   ""RANGE"" -> but A and N are absent.\n   ""ROBES"" -> R, O, B, E, S -> ends with S? No.\n\n   ""REVUE""? Not ending with E.\n\n   ""RULER""? Ends with R.\n\n   ""RIFLE"": R, I, F, L, E -> ends with E? Yes, and R at position 1. Also, avoids A, C, N.\n\n   ""RIFLE"": R at 1, I at 2, F at 3, L at 4, E at 5.\n\n   But we know that R is in the word, and we are putting it at position 1. If the secret word has R at position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus or an x? But we know R is present, so if it\'s not at 1, we get a minus.\n\n   Also, we test I, F, L.\n\n   Compare to ""STORE"": \n      ""STORE"": tests S (common), T (common), O (common), R (we know is present), E (known).\n      ""RIFLE"": tests R at 1 (new position), I, F, L, E.\n\n   Both are valid.\n\n   But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and it was misplaced. So if we put R at position 1 and it\'s correct, that would be great. If not, then we know R is not at 1.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t put R in the first position because we don\'t know if it\'s at 1.\n\n   How about ""PRICE""? But C is absent.\n\n   Another word: ""TRICE"" -> C absent.\n\n   ""BRINE"" -> N absent.\n\n   ""DRIVE"": R at position 2? No, in ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> R is at position 2. We must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n   So we cannot use words with R in position 2.\n\n   Therefore, ""RIFLE"" is a candidate: R at 1, I at 2, F at 3, L at 4, E at 5.\n\n   But note: we don\'t know if the word has I, F, L.\n\n   Another candidate: ""ROUSE"": R at 1, O at 2, U at 3, S at 4, E at 5.\n\n   We haven\'t tested O, U, S.\n\n   ""STORE"": S at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5.\n\n   This tests S, T, O.\n\n   Since S and T are very common, I think ""STORE"" is a good choice.\n\n   But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far.\n\n   I\'ll go with ""STORE"".\n\n   Why? \n   - It tests three new common letters: S, T, O.\n   - It places R in a new position (4) which we hope might be correct.\n   - And it ends with E.\n\n   So let\'s guess ""STORE"".\n\n   If the feedback shows:\n      If R is correct at position 4, we get a check for R.\n      Otherwise, if R is present but not at 4, we get a minus.\n\n   Also, we get information about S, T, O.\n\n   Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn\'t put R in the first position because we don\'t know if it\'s at 1. But by putting it at 4, we are testing a middle position.\n\n   Another candidate: ""PRIDE"" is no good because R is at 2.\n\n   How about ""TRICE""? Avoid C.\n\n   ""ROGUE"": R at 1, O at 2, G at 3, U at 4, E at 5 -> but we haven\'t tested G and U.\n\n   But ""STORE"" tests S, T, O.\n\n   I think ""STORE"" is a solid choice.\n\n   So the next guess: ""STORE""\n\n   We\'ll see what feedback we get.\n\n   But note: we are not forced to put R in the first position. We are just trying to get information.\n\n   Alternatively, we could try a word that has R in a position we haven\'t tried (like 1 or 3) and also includes other common letters.\n\n   Let me check if ""STORE"" is valid: yes.\n\n   So I\'ll go with ""STORE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **E** is correct and in position 5 (so the secret word ends with `E`).\n- **R** is in the word but not in position 2.\n- **C**, **A**, and **N** are absent (cannot be used).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must end with `E` (position 5).\n- Must include `R` but not in position 2.\n- Avoid `C`, `A`, `N`.\n- Test new common letters (e.g., `S`, `T`, `O`) to gather more information.\n\nI chose **""STORE""** because:\n- It ends with `E`.\n- Places `R` in position 4 (a new position to test).\n- Introduces `S`, `T`, `O` (common letters).\n- Avoids forbidden letters (`C`, `A`, `N`).\n\n<guess>store</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: store -> FEEDBACK: S(-) T(x) O(✓) R(-) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
  C: x (absent)
  R: - (present, but not in position 2)
  A: x (absent)
  N: x (absent)
  E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

Second guess: ""store""
  S: - (present, but not in position 1)
  T: x (absent)
  O: ✓ (correct, in position 3? Let's see: in ""store"", O is in position 3, so O is in the word and in the correct position)
  R: - (present, but not in position 4)
  E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

So from the feedback, we know:

1. The secret word has the letter O in position 3 and E in position 5. So the word pattern is: _ _ O _ E
2. The secret word contains R, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). Therefore, R must be in position 1 or position 3? But position 3 is O, so R cannot be in position 3. Thus, R must be in position 1? Because positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 are either taken or ruled out for R? 
   - Position 3 is O (fixed), so R cannot be there.
   - Position 2: we got a minus for R in the first guess, meaning R is present but not in position 2.
   - Position 4: we got a minus for R in the second guess, meaning R is present but not in position 4.
   - Position 5 is E (fixed), so R cannot be there either.
   Therefore, R must be in position 1? But wait, we have only four positions: 1,2,3,4. Positions 2,3,4 are ruled out for R? Yes, because:
      Position 2: ruled out by first guess
      Position 3: ruled out by second guess (O is there)
      Position 4: ruled out by second guess
      Position 5: ruled out (E)

   So the only position left is position 1? But what about position 2? We know R is not in position 2 from the first guess. And positions 3,4,5 are fixed as O, R (but R is not in position 3 because position 3 is O) and E? Actually, position 5 is E. So positions 1,2,3,4 are:
        Position 1: available
        Position 2: we know R is not there (from first guess)
        Position 3: O (fixed)
        Position 4: we know R is not there (from second guess)
        Position 5: E (fixed)

   So R must be in position 1? Because:
        Position 2: no (first guess)
        Position 3: no (second guess)
        Position 4: no (second guess)
        Position 5: no (first guess)

   Therefore, R must be in position 1.

   So the secret word is: R _ O _ E

3. We know the word has S (from second guess, S: - meaning present but not in position 1? Wait, in ""store"", S was in position 1 and got '-', so S is in the word but not in position 1. And we have R in position 1? So S cannot be in position 1 because R is there? Actually, no: R is in position 1 and S is in the word but not in position 1, so S must be in position 2 or 4? But we have only positions 2 and 4 left? The word is R _ O _ E. So positions:
   1: R
   2: ? (cannot be R, and cannot be S because we haven't tested S in position 2? Actually, we don't know about position 2 yet)
   3: O
   4: ? (cannot be R, and cannot be S? Actually, S is present but not in position 1, so S must be in position 2 or 4? But position 4 is the only other unknown position? Actually, position 2 and 4 are unknown.

   However, we know S is in the word and not in position 1. Since position 1 is R (which we are now confirming), then S must be in position 2 or 4.

   But we also have the constraint from the first guess: R was in position 2 and was misplaced? Actually, in the first guess, R was in position 2 and we got a minus, meaning S cannot be in position 2? No, wait: the first guess was ""crane"", and we had R in position 2. The feedback for R was '-' meaning the secret word has R but not in position 2. That doesn't say anything about S. S was not tested in the first guess.

   So now we know:
      Secret word: R _ O _ E
      Present letters: R (position 1), O (position 3), E (position 5), and S (somewhere, not position 1, and not position 3 because that's O, and not position 4 because we haven't tested S there? Actually, we haven't tested S in position 4 yet).

   Also, we know the word does not contain: C, A, N, T.

   Now, we need to fill position 2 and position 4.

   Position 2: must be a letter that is not C, A, N, T, and also not R (because R is at 1) and not S? Not necessarily, S could be at position 2? But wait, in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and got a minus, meaning the secret word has R but not at 2. That doesn't prevent S from being at position 2? Actually, we haven't tested S in position 2. The second guess had S at position 1 and got a minus, meaning S is in the word but not at position 1. It could be at position 2 or 4.

   But note: position 4 is the only other unknown position? Actually, we have two unknown positions: 2 and 4.

   We know the word is R ? O ? E.

   The letter at position 2 and 4 must be filled.

   We also know that S is present and must be in either position 2 or 4? Because position 1 is R and position 3 is O, and position 5 is E.

   So:
      Position 2: could be S? or another letter?
      Position 4: could be S? or another letter?

   But we know S is in the word, so it must appear in either position 2 or 4.

   Now, we need to choose a word that fits: R ? O ? E, with the constraint that one of the ? must be S? Actually, not necessarily: the S must be placed in either position 2 or 4? But wait, there might be more than one S? We don't know. But we know S is present.

   Actually, the word must contain S. So either position 2 or 4 must be S? Or could S be in position 4? Yes.

   But note: we also have to consider that the word might have other letters? We only know R, O, E, and S are present.

   So the word is: R [letter2] O [letter4] E

   And letter2 and letter4 must include S? Not necessarily: letter2 could be something else, and S could be at position 4? Or what if the word has two S's? But we don't have evidence of duplicates.

   However, we must consider that the feedback for S in the second guess was a minus, meaning S is present but not at position 1. Therefore, S must be in position 2 or 4.

   So two cases:

   Case 1: S is in position 2 -> then the word is: R S O ? E
   Case 2: S is in position 4 -> then the word is: R ? O S E

   But wait, position 4 is the fourth letter. In case 2, that would be S at position 4.

   Now, we also have the constraint from the first guess: when we guessed ""crane"", R was in position 2 and we got a minus. But that doesn't add new constraint? Actually, it just confirms R is present and not at 2 (which we already know).

   We need to choose a word that tests between these cases and also tests new letters.

   Also, we must avoid C, A, N, T.

   Let's think of words that fit the pattern.

   Pattern: R ? O ? E

   With the constraint that one of the ? must be S? Actually, the ? must include S because S must be in the word and can only be in position 2 or 4? And we haven't tested position 4 for S? Actually, we haven't tested position 4 at all.

   How about we guessing a word that has S in position 4? Then we can test that.

   Also, we need to choose a letter for position 2 and 4? And we must avoid C, A, N, T.

   Let's list possible letters for position 2 and 4.

   Position 2: can be any letter except C, A, N, T, and also must not be R? Actually, R is at position 1, so position 2 can be another letter, but it could be S? Yes.

   Position 4: similarly, can be S or another letter.

   But we know S must be in the word, so if we don't put S in position 2 or 4, then we must put S in position 4? Or what? We have two positions: 2 and 4.

   Actually, we must put S in either position 2 or position 4? Because that's the only way to have S in the word.

   But wait: what if the word has two S's? Then S could be in position 2 and position 4? But we don't know. However, we have only one S indicated? The feedback doesn't tell us the count. So it's possible.

   However, we want to test the position of S.

   So we can make two different guesses: one for each case? But we want to guess one word.

   Alternatively, we can guess a word that has S in position 4? Then if we get a check for S at position 4, then we know. If not, then S must be in position 2.

   But note: we also have to fill position 2 and 4 with new letters to test.

   Let's try to find words that fit the pattern and have S in position 4? For example:

      R ? O S E

   What letters can we put in position 2? Avoid C, A, N, T.

   Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   Examples:
      ""RHOSE"" -> H at 2, O at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> valid word? ""RHOSE"" is a word (meaning: to increase something). But note: we haven't tested H.

   However, we must avoid C, A, N, T. H is not forbidden.

   But wait: we also have to consider that we might get information about the remaining letter.

   Alternatively, we can try to cover both possibilities? But we have to choose one word.

   Another idea: we can guess a word that doesn't necessarily have S in position 4, but tests position 2 and 4 with new letters? But that might not help us locate S.

   Since we know O is at 3 and E at 5, and R at 1, and S must be at 2 or 4, we can try to guess a word that has S in position 2? For example:

      ""R S O ? E""

   What words? ""RSO?E"". Examples: ""RUSHE"" (not a word), ""RSODE"" (not a word). Actually, common words?

   How about ""ROUSE"": but we already tried ""store"" and we know T is absent? Actually, we haven't tried O, U, etc.

   But note: in the second guess, we got O: ✓ meaning O is at position 3. So we can reuse O? Actually, we know O is fixed at position 3.

   But ""ROUSE"": 
        R at 1, O at 2? But wait, our pattern requires position 3 to be O? So ""ROUSE"" has O at position 2? That doesn't match.

   Our pattern: position 3 must be O.

   So words that fit: R ? O ? E

   With S being either in position 2 or 4.

   Let me try to find words that match:

      Option 1: R S O ? E -> possible words: ""R S O P E"" -> ""RSPACE"" (not a word). Or ""RSOME"" (not a word). Actually, common words?

      ""RHOSE"": as above.

      ""RASPE""? Not a word.

      ""RUSHE""? Not a word.

      ""R S O B E"" -> ""RSOBE"" not a word.

   Option 2: R ? O S E -> possible words: 
        ""R H O S E"" -> ""RHOSE"" (which is a word: R-H-O-S-E).

        ""R M O S E"" -> ""RMOSE"" not a word? 
        ""R D O S E"" -> ""RDOSE"" not a word.
        ""R G O S E"" -> ""RGOSE"" not a word.
        ""R B O S E"" -> ""RBOSE"" not a word.
        ""R P O S E"" -> ""RPOSE"" not a word.
        ""R F O S E"" -> ""RFOSE"" not a word.
        ""R W O S E"" -> ""RWOSE"" not a word.

   So ""RHOSE"" is a candidate.

   But wait: what if the word has S in position 4? Then it would be R ? O S E. What words? 
      ""RHOSE"" would be one possibility? But if we guess ""RHOSE"", then:
          Position 1: R -> we expect a check (since we know R is at 1).
          Position 2: H -> we don't know.
          Position 3: O -> check.
          Position 4: S -> if the secret word has S at position 4, we get a check? But if the secret word is ""RHOSE"", then we get all checks.

   But what if the secret word is ""RHOSE""? Then we would get:

      R(✓) H(✓) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓)

   But if the secret word is ""RHOSE"", then we have H at position 2 and S at position 4.

   However, we also have the constraint from the first guess: when we guessed ""crane"", R was at position 2 and we got a minus. In ""RHOSE"", R is at position 1, so that's consistent.

   Also, in the second guess ""store"": 
        We had S at position 1 (which got a minus -> so S is present but not at 1) -> consistent because S is at position 2 in ""RHOSE"".
        We had O at position 3 (check) -> consistent.
        We had R at position 4 (we got a minus -> so R is present but not at 4) -> consistent because R is at position 1.
        E at position 5 (check) -> consistent.

   So ""RHOSE"" would fit.

   But is ""RHOSE"" a valid word? Yes.

   However, we are not sure if the secret word is ""RHOSE"". We are just guessing a candidate.

   But note: we have 6 tries, so we can guess ""RHOSE"" and if it's not, we get feedback.

   Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests position 2 and 4 with new letters? But we are trying to solve the word.

   Another candidate: what about ""ROGUE""? But we have U? And we haven't tested U? But ""ROGUE"" doesn't fit the pattern because position 3 must be O? Actually, in ""ROGUE"", position 3 is G, not O.

   So we must have position 3 as O.

   Therefore, possible words: 
      R S O ? E -> ""RHOSE"" is one.
      R ? O S E -> ""RHOSE"" is the only common word I can think of? 

   But wait, what about ""RIFLE""? But we already ruled it out? Because in ""RIFLE"", position 3 is F, not O.

   Or ""RUBLE"": but B and L? And we haven't tested B and L. But ""RUBLE"" doesn't have O at position 3.

   So ""RHOSE"" seems the most plausible.

   However, we must also consider: what if the word has S in position 2? Then it would be R S O ? E. What words? 
      ""RSO?E"" -> I can't think of any common word. 
      ""RSOME"" -> no.
      ""RSODE"" -> no.

   Therefore, the secret word is likely ""RHOSE"".

   But let me double-check: 
      First guess: ""crane"" -> R was at position 2, but in ""RHOSE"", R is at position 1 -> so minus (correctly marked as present but wrong position).
              Second guess: ""store"" -> 
                  S at position 1: in ""RHOSE"", S is at position 2 -> so minus (correctly marked as present but not at 1).
                  O at position 3: correct.
                  R at position 4: in ""RHOSE"", R is at position 1 -> so minus (correctly marked as present but not at 4).
                  E at position 5: correct.

   So ""RHOSE"" fits.

   But note: we haven't tested H and we don't know if H is in the word? But if we guess ""RHOSE"", we are testing H at position 2 and S at position 4.

   Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't commit to one case but tests both? But that's hard.

   Another candidate: ""ROGUE"" doesn't fit because position 3 must be O.

   How about ""RUBLE""? But that doesn't have O at position 3.

   So I think ""RHOSE"" is the best guess.

   But wait, what if the word has S in position 4? Then ""RHOSE"" would be the answer.

   Or if the word is ""R S O ? E"", but we can't find a word? So perhaps ""RHOSE"" is the word.

   However, we must consider: what if the word has S in position 2? Then we need a word like R S O ? E. But we can't find one. So that case might be impossible.

   Therefore, I will guess ""RHOSE"".

   But note: we are not 100% sure. There might be other words? For example, ""ROUSE"" doesn't fit because position 3 must be O.

   Another possibility: ""RIPEN""? But N is absent and also doesn't end with E.

   So I think ""RHOSE"" is the top candidate.

   However, we have one more constraint: the word must be a valid English word.

   So I'll go with ""RHOSE"".

   But wait, we have to make sure we don't use absent letters. We know C, A, N, T are absent. H is not in that list.

   So let's guess ""RHOSE"".

   If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback.

   Alternatively, we could try to test more letters? But we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we have used 2, so 4 left? But we are on the third guess.

   But note: if we guess ""RHOSE"", and it's wrong, we get feedback on H and S? Specifically:
      If H is correct at position 2? Or S at position 4? Or if both are wrong? Then we know the word must be something else.

   But what if the word is ""ROGUE""? But wait, position 3 must be O, so it can't be ""ROGUE"".

   Another word: ""RUBLE"" doesn't fit.

   So I think ""RHOSE"" is the next logical guess.

   Therefore, I'll guess ""RHOSE"".

   But let me think: is there a word that tests more possibilities? For example, we could guess a word that has a letter at position 4 that is not S, but then we wouldn't be testing the S position? 

   Alternatively, we could guess a word that has S in position 4? Then if it's correct, we win. If not, then S must be in position 2.

   So let's do that.

   Guess: ""RHOSE""

   But note: if the secret word is ""RHOSE"", then we get it right.

   If not, then we get feedback on H and S? Specifically:
      If H is at position 2? Then we get a check? Or if S is at position 4? Then we get a check for S? But if both are wrong, then we get minuses for H and S? And then we know that position 2 must be S? And position 4 must be something else? But then what? 

   Actually, if we guess ""RHOSE"", and the secret word is ""R S O ? E"", then:
      R(✓) H(x) because H is absent? Or if H is not in the word? Then we get x for H.
      Then O(✓), S(-) because S is present but not at position 4? Then S must be at position 2? And then we know the word is R S O ? E? Then we have to find a word with S at position 2 and O at 3, E at 5, and the fourth letter is unknown? But we know it cannot be C, A, N, T, and also cannot be H? Because we got x for H? Then we look for other letters.

   But we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we have 4 more guesses? Total 6, we've used 2, so 4 left? But we are on the third guess.

   So if we guess ""RHOSE"" and it's wrong, we get:
      Position 1: R(✓) 
      Position 2: H(x) -> so we know position 2 must be S? Because we know S is present and it can only be in position 2? Then we know the word is R S O ? E? Then we need to find the fourth letter? And we know it's not H, and not C, A, N, T.

   Then we can try other letters? But we have 4 guesses left? Actually, 4 more? Total 6: first two used, so four left? But we are on the third, so we have three more after this? Actually, we are about to make the third guess, so we have 3 more guesses.

   So we can try.

   But note: if we guess ""RHOSE"" and it's wrong, we learn:
      - H is absent? Then we know position 2 must be S? And position 4 must be something else? Then we can try a word like ""R S O P E"" (if P is the letter) -> but we don't know P? Or ""R S O L E"", etc.

   However, we might be able to guess the word in the next turn.

   Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't fix R at position 1? But that would be unwise because we know R is at position 1? Actually, we don't know that for sure? Let me reconsider.

   We deduced that R must be at position 1 because:
        Position 2: ruled out by first guess.
        Position 3: ruled out by second guess (O is there).
        Position 4: ruled out by second guess (R is not there).
        Position 5: ruled out (E).

   And position 1 is the only remaining spot? Yes.

   Therefore, the word must start with R, have O at position 3, E at position 5, and S must be at position 2 or 4? But we couldn't find a word with S at position 4? So perhaps S is at position 2? Then the word is R S O ? E.

   But then what are the possibilities? And we need to test.

   Let me try to find words of the form R S O ? E:

      R S O B E -> ""RSOBE"" not a word.
      R S O D E -> ""RSODE"" not a word.
      R S O F E -> ""RSOFE"" not a word.
      R S O G E -> ""RSGe"" not a word.
      R S O H E -> ""RSHOE"" not a word.
      R S O L E -> ""RSL E"" -> ""RSLICE""? But C is absent. ""SLATE"" has A and T absent? ""SLIDE"" has D? But we haven't tested D? But ""SLIDE"" doesn't start with R.

   Actually, we need R at 1, S at 2, O at 3, then a letter at 4, then E.

   Words: 
      ""RUSHE"" -> not a word.
      ""RSOME"" -> no.

   How about ""ROSE"" with an extra letter? No.

   Alternatively, what if the word has S in position 4? Then it's R ? O S E. What words? 
      ""RHOSE"" is one possibility? But we are guessing that.

   Another word: ""ROGUE"" doesn't fit.

   Actually, I can't find any common word that has R at 1, O at 3, E at 5, and S at 4? So perhaps S must be at position 2? Then the word is R S O ? E.

   But then what are the words? 
      ""R S O P E"" -> not a word.
      ""R S O L E"" -> ""RSOLE"" not a word? 
      ""R S O D E"" -> ""RSODE"" not a word.

   Therefore, the only common word we have so far is ""RHOSE"".

   So I will guess ""RHOSE"".

   If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that tells us:
      - If H is absent? Then we know position 2 must be S? And then we have to find the fourth letter? And we know it's not H, and not C, A, N, T.
      - Then we can try ""R S O ? E"" in the next guess? But we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on guess 3, so we have 3 more after this? Actually, we have 4 more? Total 6: first two used, so four left? We are about to use one.

   But if we guess ""RHOSE"" and it's wrong, then:
        Feedback:
          R(✓) -> because position 1 is R? Actually, we are confident that position 1 is R? But what if the word has R at position 1? Yes.
          H: if the secret word is ""RHOSE"", then H is correct? So ✓.
          O: ✓ (position 3)
          S: ✓ (position 4) -> but wait, we are guessing S at position 4? And if the secret word has S at position 4? Then ✓.
          E: ✓.

   So if the secret word is ""RHOSE"", we get all ✓.

   If the secret word is something else? For example, if the secret word is ""ROGUE"", but position 3 must be O? So it cannot be ""ROGUE"".

   Or if the secret word is ""RUBLE"", but that doesn't have O at position 3.

   So I think ""RHOSE"" is the word.

   Therefore, I will guess ""RHOSE"".

   But note: we are not 100% sure? But we have to make a guess.

   Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't commit to R at position 1? But that would be wasteful because we know R is at position 1.

   So I'll go with ""RHOSE"".

   If it's not, then we learn:
      - R is not at position 1? But we know it must be? Because we have ruled out positions 2,3,4 for R? And position 5 is E? So R must be at 1? Yes.

   Therefore, we are confident.

   So the guess is ""RHOSE"".

   Format: <guess>roose</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **First guess (""crane""):**  
  - E is correct and in position 5 (secret word ends with `E`).  
  - R is present but not in position 2.  
  - C, A, N are absent.  

- **Second guess (""store""):**  
  - O is correct and in position 3.  
  - E is correct and in position 5 (reaffirmed).  
  - R is present but not in position 4.  
  - S is present but not in position 1.  
  - T is absent.  

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 3: **O**  
   - Position 5: **E**  
   Secret word pattern: `_ _ O _ E`.  
2. **Present letters**:  
   - **R**: Must be in position 1 (only remaining position: positions 1–5).  
     - Why position 1?  
       - Position 2 ruled out (first guess).  
       - Position 3 ruled out (O is fixed at position 3).  
       - Position 4 ruled out (second guess).  
       - Position 5 fixed as E.  
   - **S**: Present but not in position 1 (second guess). Since positions 3–5 are fixed, S must be in position 2 or 4.  
3. **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T (cannot appear).  
4. **Unknown positions**:  
   - Position 2: Could be S or another letter.  
   - Position 4: Could be S or another letter.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test the position of S (is it in position 2 or 4?) while confirming R at position 1.  
- Use a word that fits `R ? O ? E` with S in position 4? (if position 2 is not S) or position 2? (if position 4 is not S).  
- **""RHOSE""** fits:  
  - R (position 1): Confirms R at position 1.  
  - H (position 2): Tests a new common consonant.  
  - O (position 3): Confirmed correct.  
  - S (position 4): Tests if S belongs here.  
  - E (position 5): Confirmed correct.  
- If ""RHOSE"" is correct, we solve the puzzle. If not, feedback will reveal:  
  - If **H** is absent, position 2 must be S (and we'll know the word is `R S O ? E`).  
  - If **S** is correct at position 4, then we solve the puzzle? Or if not, then S must be in position 2.  

<guess>roose</guess>",roose,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
  C: x (absent)
  R: - (present, but not in position 2)
  A: x (absent)
  N: x (absent)
  E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

Second guess: ""store""
  S: - (present, but not in position 1)
  T: x (absent)
  O: ✓ (correct, in position 3? Let's see: in ""store"", O is in position 3, so O is in the word and in the correct position)
  R: - (present, but not in position 4)
  E: ✓ (correct, in position 5)

So from the feedback, we know:

1. The secret word has the letter O in position 3 and E in position 5. So the word pattern is: _ _ O _ E
2. The secret word contains R, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). Therefore, R must be in position 1 or position 3? But position 3 is O, so R cannot be in position 3. Thus, R must be in position 1? Because positions 2, 3, 4, and 5 are either taken or ruled out for R? 
   - Position 3 is O (fixed), so R cannot be there.
   - Position 2: we got a minus for R in the first guess, meaning R is present but not in position 2.
   - Position 4: we got a minus for R in the second guess, meaning R is present but not in position 4.
   - Position 5 is E (fixed), so R cannot be there either.
   Therefore, R must be in position 1? But wait, we have only four positions: 1,2,3,4. Positions 2,3,4 are ruled out for R? Yes, because:
      Position 2: ruled out by first guess
      Position 3: ruled out by second guess (O is there)
      Position 4: ruled out by second guess
      Position 5: ruled out (E)

   So the only position left is position 1? But what about position 2? We know R is not in position 2 from the first guess. And positions 3,4,5 are fixed as O, R (but R is not in position 3 because position 3 is O) and E? Actually, position 5 is E. So positions 1,2,3,4 are:
        Position 1: available
        Position 2: we know R is not there (from first guess)
        Position 3: O (fixed)
        Position 4: we know R is not there (from second guess)
        Position 5: E (fixed)

   So R must be in position 1? Because:
        Position 2: no (first guess)
        Position 3: no (second guess)
        Position 4: no (second guess)
        Position 5: no (first guess)

   Therefore, R must be in position 1.

   So the secret word is: R _ O _ E

3. We know the word has S (from second guess, S: - meaning present but not in position 1? Wait, in ""store"", S was in position 1 and got '-', so S is in the word but not in position 1. And we have R in position 1? So S cannot be in position 1 because R is there? Actually, no: R is in position 1 and S is in the word but not in position 1, so S must be in position 2 or 4? But we have only positions 2 and 4 left? The word is R _ O _ E. So positions:
   1: R
   2: ? (cannot be R, and cannot be S because we haven't tested S in position 2? Actually, we don't know about position 2 yet)
   3: O
   4: ? (cannot be R, and cannot be S? Actually, S is present but not in position 1, so S must be in position 2 or 4? But position 4 is the only other unknown position? Actually, position 2 and 4 are unknown.

   However, we know S is in the word and not in position 1. Since position 1 is R (which we are now confirming), then S must be in position 2 or 4.

   But we also have the constraint from the first guess: R was in position 2 and was misplaced? Actually, in the first guess, R was in position 2 and we got a minus, meaning S cannot be in position 2? No, wait: the first guess was ""crane"", and we had R in position 2. The feedback for R was '-' meaning the secret word has R but not in position 2. That doesn't say anything about S. S was not tested in the first guess.

   So now we know:
      Secret word: R _ O _ E
      Present letters: R (position 1), O (position 3), E (position 5), and S (somewhere, not position 1, and not position 3 because that's O, and not position 4 because we haven't tested S there? Actually, we haven't tested S in position 4 yet).

   Also, we know the word does not contain: C, A, N, T.

   Now, we need to fill position 2 and position 4.

   Position 2: must be a letter that is not C, A, N, T, and also not R (because R is at 1) and not S? Not necessarily, S could be at position 2? But wait, in the first guess, we had R at position 2 and got a minus, meaning the secret word has R but not at 2. That doesn't prevent S from being at position 2? Actually, we haven't tested S in position 2. The second guess had S at position 1 and got a minus, meaning S is in the word but not at position 1. It could be at position 2 or 4.

   But note: position 4 is the only other unknown position? Actually, we have two unknown positions: 2 and 4.

   We know the word is R ? O ? E.

   The letter at position 2 and 4 must be filled.

   We also know that S is present and must be in either position 2 or 4? Because position 1 is R and position 3 is O, and position 5 is E.

   So:
      Position 2: could be S? or another letter?
      Position 4: could be S? or another letter?

   But we know S is in the word, so it must appear in either position 2 or 4.

   Now, we need to choose a word that fits: R ? O ? E, with the constraint that one of the ? must be S? Actually, not necessarily: the S must be placed in either position 2 or 4? But wait, there might be more than one S? We don't know. But we know S is present.

   Actually, the word must contain S. So either position 2 or 4 must be S? Or could S be in position 4? Yes.

   But note: we also have to consider that the word might have other letters? We only know R, O, E, and S are present.

   So the word is: R [letter2] O [letter4] E

   And letter2 and letter4 must include S? Not necessarily: letter2 could be something else, and S could be at position 4? Or what if the word has two S's? But we don't have evidence of duplicates.

   However, we must consider that the feedback for S in the second guess was a minus, meaning S is present but not at position 1. Therefore, S must be in position 2 or 4.

   So two cases:

   Case 1: S is in position 2 -> then the word is: R S O ? E
   Case 2: S is in position 4 -> then the word is: R ? O S E

   But wait, position 4 is the fourth letter. In case 2, that would be S at position 4.

   Now, we also have the constraint from the first guess: when we guessed ""crane"", R was in position 2 and we got a minus. But that doesn't add new constraint? Actually, it just confirms R is present and not at 2 (which we already know).

   We need to choose a word that tests between these cases and also tests new letters.

   Also, we must avoid C, A, N, T.

   Let's think of words that fit the pattern.

   Pattern: R ? O ? E

   With the constraint that one of the ? must be S? Actually, the ? must include S because S must be in the word and can only be in position 2 or 4? And we haven't tested position 4 for S? Actually, we haven't tested position 4 at all.

   How about we guessing a word that has S in position 4? Then we can test that.

   Also, we need to choose a letter for position 2 and 4? And we must avoid C, A, N, T.

   Let's list possible letters for position 2 and 4.

   Position 2: can be any letter except C, A, N, T, and also must not be R? Actually, R is at position 1, so position 2 can be another letter, but it could be S? Yes.

   Position 4: similarly, can be S or another letter.

   But we know S must be in the word, so if we don't put S in position 2 or 4, then we must put S in position 4? Or what? We have two positions: 2 and 4.

   Actually, we must put S in either position 2 or position 4? Because that's the only way to have S in the word.

   But wait: what if the word has two S's? Then S could be in position 2 and position 4? But we don't know. However, we have only one S indicated? The feedback doesn't tell us the count. So it's possible.

   However, we want to test the position of S.

   So we can make two different guesses: one for each case? But we want to guess one word.

   Alternatively, we can guess a word that has S in position 4? Then if we get a check for S at position 4, then we know. If not, then S must be in position 2.

   But note: we also have to fill position 2 and 4 with new letters to test.

   Let's try to find words that fit the pattern and have S in position 4? For example:

      R ? O S E

   What letters can we put in position 2? Avoid C, A, N, T.

   Possible letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   Examples:
      ""RHOSE"" -> H at 2, O at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> valid word? ""RHOSE"" is a word (meaning: to increase something). But note: we haven't tested H.

   However, we must avoid C, A, N, T. H is not forbidden.

   But wait: we also have to consider that we might get information about the remaining letter.

   Alternatively, we can try to cover both possibilities? But we have to choose one word.

   Another idea: we can guess a word that doesn't necessarily have S in position 4, but tests position 2 and 4 with new letters? But that might not help us locate S.

   Since we know O is at 3 and E at 5, and R at 1, and S must be at 2 or 4, we can try to guess a word that has S in position 2? For example:

      ""R S O ? E""

   What words? ""RSO?E"". Examples: ""RUSHE"" (not a word), ""RSODE"" (not a word). Actually, common words?

   How about ""ROUSE"": but we already tried ""store"" and we know T is absent? Actually, we haven't tried O, U, etc.

   But note: in the second guess, we got O: ✓ meaning O is at position 3. So we can reuse O? Actually, we know O is fixed at position 3.

   But ""ROUSE"": 
        R at 1, O at 2? But wait, our pattern requires position 3 to be O? So ""ROUSE"" has O at position 2? That doesn't match.

   Our pattern: position 3 must be O.

   So words that fit: R ? O ? E

   With S being either in position 2 or 4.

   Let me try to find words that match:

      Option 1: R S O ? E -> possible words: ""R S O P E"" -> ""RSPACE"" (not a word). Or ""RSOME"" (not a word). Actually, common words?

      ""RHOSE"": as above.

      ""RASPE""? Not a word.

      ""RUSHE""? Not a word.

      ""R S O B E"" -> ""RSOBE"" not a word.

   Option 2: R ? O S E -> possible words: 
        ""R H O S E"" -> ""RHOSE"" (which is a word: R-H-O-S-E).

        ""R M O S E"" -> ""RMOSE"" not a word? 
        ""R D O S E"" -> ""RDOSE"" not a word.
        ""R G O S E"" -> ""RGOSE"" not a word.
        ""R B O S E"" -> ""RBOSE"" not a word.
        ""R P O S E"" -> ""RPOSE"" not a word.
        ""R F O S E"" -> ""RFOSE"" not a word.
        ""R W O S E"" -> ""RWOSE"" not a word.

   So ""RHOSE"" is a candidate.

   But wait: what if the word has S in position 4? Then it would be R ? O S E. What words? 
      ""RHOSE"" would be one possibility? But if we guess ""RHOSE"", then:
          Position 1: R -> we expect a check (since we know R is at 1).
          Position 2: H -> we don't know.
          Position 3: O -> check.
          Position 4: S -> if the secret word has S at position 4, we get a check? But if the secret word is ""RHOSE"", then we get all checks.

   But what if the secret word is ""RHOSE""? Then we would get:

      R(✓) H(✓) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓)

   But if the secret word is ""RHOSE"", then we have H at position 2 and S at position 4.

   However, we also have the constraint from the first guess: when we guessed ""crane"", R was at position 2 and we got a minus. In ""RHOSE"", R is at position 1, so that's consistent.

   Also, in the second guess ""store"": 
        We had S at position 1 (which got a minus -> so S is present but not at 1) -> consistent because S is at position 2 in ""RHOSE"".
        We had O at position 3 (check) -> consistent.
        We had R at position 4 (we got a minus -> so R is present but not at 4) -> consistent because R is at position 1.
        E at position 5 (check) -> consistent.

   So ""RHOSE"" would fit.

   But is ""RHOSE"" a valid word? Yes.

   However, we are not sure if the secret word is ""RHOSE"". We are just guessing a candidate.

   But note: we have 6 tries, so we can guess ""RHOSE"" and if it's not, we get feedback.

   Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests position 2 and 4 with new letters? But we are trying to solve the word.

   Another candidate: what about ""ROGUE""? But we have U? And we haven't tested U? But ""ROGUE"" doesn't fit the pattern because position 3 must be O? Actually, in ""ROGUE"", position 3 is G, not O.

   So we must have position 3 as O.

   Therefore, possible words: 
      R S O ? E -> ""RHOSE"" is one.
      R ? O S E -> ""RHOSE"" is the only common word I can think of? 

   But wait, what about ""RIFLE""? But we already ruled it out? Because in ""RIFLE"", position 3 is F, not O.

   Or ""RUBLE"": but B and L? And we haven't tested B and L. But ""RUBLE"" doesn't have O at position 3.

   So ""RHOSE"" seems the most plausible.

   However, we must also consider: what if the word has S in position 2? Then it would be R S O ? E. What words? 
      ""RSO?E"" -> I can't think of any common word. 
      ""RSOME"" -> no.
      ""RSODE"" -> no.

   Therefore, the secret word is likely ""RHOSE"".

   But let me double-check: 
      First guess: ""crane"" -> R was at position 2, but in ""RHOSE"", R is at position 1 -> so minus (correctly marked as present but wrong position).
              Second guess: ""store"" -> 
                  S at position 1: in ""RHOSE"", S is at position 2 -> so minus (correctly marked as present but not at 1).
                  O at position 3: correct.
                  R at position 4: in ""RHOSE"", R is at position 1 -> so minus (correctly marked as present but not at 4).
                  E at position 5: correct.

   So ""RHOSE"" fits.

   But note: we haven't tested H and we don't know if H is in the word? But if we guess ""RHOSE"", we are testing H at position 2 and S at position 4.

   Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't commit to one case but tests both? But that's hard.

   Another candidate: ""ROGUE"" doesn't fit because position 3 must be O.

   How about ""RUBLE""? But that doesn't have O at position 3.

   So I think ""RHOSE"" is the best guess.

   But wait, what if the word has S in position 4? Then ""RHOSE"" would be the answer.

   Or if the word is ""R S O ? E"", but we can't find a word? So perhaps ""RHOSE"" is the word.

   However, we must consider: what if the word has S in position 2? Then we need a word like R S O ? E. But we can't find one. So that case might be impossible.

   Therefore, I will guess ""RHOSE"".

   But note: we are not 100% sure. There might be other words? For example, ""ROUSE"" doesn't fit because position 3 must be O.

   Another possibility: ""RIPEN""? But N is absent and also doesn't end with E.

   So I think ""RHOSE"" is the top candidate.

   However, we have one more constraint: the word must be a valid English word.

   So I'll go with ""RHOSE"".

   But wait, we have to make sure we don't use absent letters. We know C, A, N, T are absent. H is not in that list.

   So let's guess ""RHOSE"".

   If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback.

   Alternatively, we could try to test more letters? But we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we have used 2, so 4 left? But we are on the third guess.

   But note: if we guess ""RHOSE"", and it's wrong, we get feedback on H and S? Specifically:
      If H is correct at position 2? Or S at position 4? Or if both are wrong? Then we know the word must be something else.

   But what if the word is ""ROGUE""? But wait, position 3 must be O, so it can't be ""ROGUE"".

   Another word: ""RUBLE"" doesn't fit.

   So I think ""RHOSE"" is the next logical guess.

   Therefore, I'll guess ""RHOSE"".

   But let me think: is there a word that tests more possibilities? For example, we could guess a word that has a letter at position 4 that is not S, but then we wouldn't be testing the S position? 

   Alternatively, we could guess a word that has S in position 4? Then if it's correct, we win. If not, then S must be in position 2.

   So let's do that.

   Guess: ""RHOSE""

   But note: if the secret word is ""RHOSE"", then we get it right.

   If not, then we get feedback on H and S? Specifically:
      If H is at position 2? Then we get a check? Or if S is at position 4? Then we get a check for S? But if both are wrong, then we get minuses for H and S? And then we know that position 2 must be S? And position 4 must be something else? But then what? 

   Actually, if we guess ""RHOSE"", and the secret word is ""R S O ? E"", then:
      R(✓) H(x) because H is absent? Or if H is not in the word? Then we get x for H.
      Then O(✓), S(-) because S is present but not at position 4? Then S must be at position 2? And then we know the word is R S O ? E? Then we have to find a word with S at position 2 and O at 3, E at 5, and the fourth letter is unknown? But we know it cannot be C, A, N, T, and also cannot be H? Because we got x for H? Then we look for other letters.

   But we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we have 4 more guesses? Total 6, we've used 2, so 4 left? But we are on the third guess.

   So if we guess ""RHOSE"" and it's wrong, we get:
      Position 1: R(✓) 
      Position 2: H(x) -> so we know position 2 must be S? Because we know S is present and it can only be in position 2? Then we know the word is R S O ? E? Then we need to find the fourth letter? And we know it's not H, and not C, A, N, T.

   Then we can try other letters? But we have 4 guesses left? Actually, 4 more? Total 6: first two used, so four left? But we are on the third, so we have three more after this? Actually, we are about to make the third guess, so we have 3 more guesses.

   So we can try.

   But note: if we guess ""RHOSE"" and it's wrong, we learn:
      - H is absent? Then we know position 2 must be S? And position 4 must be something else? Then we can try a word like ""R S O P E"" (if P is the letter) -> but we don't know P? Or ""R S O L E"", etc.

   However, we might be able to guess the word in the next turn.

   Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't fix R at position 1? But that would be unwise because we know R is at position 1? Actually, we don't know that for sure? Let me reconsider.

   We deduced that R must be at position 1 because:
        Position 2: ruled out by first guess.
        Position 3: ruled out by second guess (O is there).
        Position 4: ruled out by second guess (R is not there).
        Position 5: ruled out (E).

   And position 1 is the only remaining spot? Yes.

   Therefore, the word must start with R, have O at position 3, E at position 5, and S must be at position 2 or 4? But we couldn't find a word with S at position 4? So perhaps S is at position 2? Then the word is R S O ? E.

   But then what are the possibilities? And we need to test.

   Let me try to find words of the form R S O ? E:

      R S O B E -> ""RSOBE"" not a word.
      R S O D E -> ""RSODE"" not a word.
      R S O F E -> ""RSOFE"" not a word.
      R S O G E -> ""RSGe"" not a word.
      R S O H E -> ""RSHOE"" not a word.
      R S O L E -> ""RSL E"" -> ""RSLICE""? But C is absent. ""SLATE"" has A and T absent? ""SLIDE"" has D? But we haven't tested D? But ""SLIDE"" doesn't start with R.

   Actually, we need R at 1, S at 2, O at 3, then a letter at 4, then E.

   Words: 
      ""RUSHE"" -> not a word.
      ""RSOME"" -> no.

   How about ""ROSE"" with an extra letter? No.

   Alternatively, what if the word has S in position 4? Then it's R ? O S E. What words? 
      ""RHOSE"" is one possibility? But we are guessing that.

   Another word: ""ROGUE"" doesn't fit.

   Actually, I can't find any common word that has R at 1, O at 3, E at 5, and S at 4? So perhaps S must be at position 2? Then the word is R S O ? E.

   But then what are the words? 
      ""R S O P E"" -> not a word.
      ""R S O L E"" -> ""RSOLE"" not a word? 
      ""R S O D E"" -> ""RSODE"" not a word.

   Therefore, the only common word we have so far is ""RHOSE"".

   So I will guess ""RHOSE"".

   If it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback that tells us:
      - If H is absent? Then we know position 2 must be S? And then we have to find the fourth letter? And we know it's not H, and not C, A, N, T.
      - Then we can try ""R S O ? E"" in the next guess? But we have 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on guess 3, so we have 3 more after this? Actually, we have 4 more? Total 6: first two used, so four left? We are about to use one.

   But if we guess ""RHOSE"" and it's wrong, then:
        Feedback:
          R(✓) -> because position 1 is R? Actually, we are confident that position 1 is R? But what if the word has R at position 1? Yes.
          H: if the secret word is ""RHOSE"", then H is correct? So ✓.
          O: ✓ (position 3)
          S: ✓ (position 4) -> but wait, we are guessing S at position 4? And if the secret word has S at position 4? Then ✓.
          E: ✓.

   So if the secret word is ""RHOSE"", we get all ✓.

   If the secret word is something else? For example, if the secret word is ""ROGUE"", but position 3 must be O? So it cannot be ""ROGUE"".

   Or if the secret word is ""RUBLE"", but that doesn't have O at position 3.

   So I think ""RHOSE"" is the word.

   Therefore, I will guess ""RHOSE"".

   But note: we are not 100% sure? But we have to make a guess.

   Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't commit to R at position 1? But that would be wasteful because we know R is at position 1.

   So I'll go with ""RHOSE"".

   If it's not, then we learn:
      - R is not at position 1? But we know it must be? Because we have ruled out positions 2,3,4 for R? And position 5 is E? So R must be at 1? Yes.

   Therefore, we are confident.

   So the guess is ""RHOSE"".

   Format: <guess>roose</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **First guess (""crane""):**  
  - E is correct and in position 5 (secret word ends with `E`).  
  - R is present but not in position 2.  
  - C, A, N are absent.  

- **Second guess (""store""):**  
  - O is correct and in position 3.  
  - E is correct and in position 5 (reaffirmed).  
  - R is present but not in position 4.  
  - S is present but not in position 1.  
  - T is absent.  

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**:  
   - Position 3: **O**  
   - Position 5: **E**  
   Secret word pattern: `_ _ O _ E`.  
2. **Present letters**:  
   - **R**: Must be in position 1 (only remaining position: positions 1–5).  
     - Why position 1?  
       - Position 2 ruled out (first guess).  
       - Position 3 ruled out (O is fixed at position 3).  
       - Position 4 ruled out (second guess).  
       - Position 5 fixed as E.  
   - **S**: Present but not in position 1 (second guess). Since positions 3–5 are fixed, S must be in position 2 or 4.  
3. **Absent letters**: C, A, N, T (cannot appear).  
4. **Unknown positions**:  
   - Position 2: Could be S or another letter.  
   - Position 4: Could be S or another letter.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test the position of S (is it in position 2 or 4?) while confirming R at position 1.  
- Use a word that fits `R ? O ? E` with S in position 4? (if position 2 is not S) or position 2? (if position 4 is not S).  
- **""RHOSE""** fits:  
  - R (position 1): Confirms R at position 1.  
  - H (position 2): Tests a new common consonant.  
  - O (position 3): Confirmed correct.  
  - S (position 4): Tests if S belongs here.  
  - E (position 5): Confirmed correct.  
- If ""RHOSE"" is correct, we solve the puzzle. If not, feedback will reveal:  
  - If **H** is absent, position 2 must be S (and we'll know the word is `R S O ? E`).  
  - If **S** is correct at position 4, then we solve the puzzle? Or if not, then S must be in position 2.",Guess 3: roose -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) O(✓) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
