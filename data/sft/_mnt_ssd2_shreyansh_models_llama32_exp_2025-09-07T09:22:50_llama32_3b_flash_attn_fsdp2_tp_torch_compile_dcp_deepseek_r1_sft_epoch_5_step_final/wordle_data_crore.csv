We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: ✓ (correct position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

So, the secret word has the following pattern:
- The first letter is C.
- The second letter is R.
- The fifth letter is E.
- The letters A and N are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: C R _ _ E

We know that the word does not contain A or N. Also, since A and N are not in the word, we can eliminate any words that have A or N.

Now, we need to think of possible letters for the third and fourth positions. The third position is unknown, and the fourth position is unknown.

We should choose a word that fits the pattern C R _ _ E and uses letters that are not A or N, and also tries to cover new common letters to get more information.

Let's list some common letters that we haven't tried yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we have to form a valid English word.

We also know that the word must have exactly 5 letters and be a valid English word.

Possible words that fit C R _ _ E:

- CRIME: C R I M E -> but we have to check if I and M are allowed? We haven't eliminated them.
- CRUDE: C R U D E
- CRATE: but A is already eliminated, so no.
- CRANE: we already tried, and it had A and N which are eliminated.

Other possibilities: 
- CRIBE? (not a word)
- CRICE? (not a word)
- CRIME: yes.
- CRUDE: yes.
- CRWTH? (not common, and doesn't end with E)

We can also consider words that might have repeated letters? But the feedback didn't show any duplicates so far.

Another idea: since we know the first, second, and fifth letters, we can try to guess the third and fourth letters.

But note: we have two unknowns in the third and fourth positions.

We should choose a word that uses new letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.

Let me think of common words that fit C R _ _ E:

- CRIME: uses I and M.
- CRUDE: uses U and D.
- CRATE: uses A and T, but A is eliminated -> invalid.
- CRANE: uses A and N -> invalid.
- CRIBE: not a word.
- CRICE: not a word.
- CRIME and CRUDE are the main ones.

But there are others: 
- CRONE? -> but O is new, and N is eliminated -> invalid.
- CRUSE? -> uses S and U, but not a common word? And it ends with E? Actually, CRUSE is a word (a container).

But let's stick to common words.

We can also consider: 
- CRATE is out because of A and T? Actually, A is out, but T is new? But A is eliminated, so CRATE is invalid.

Another: CRIME seems good.

But note: we have to avoid A and N.

So, let's try CRIME.

But wait, what about the feedback? We are going to get feedback on the third and fourth letters.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't necessarily have the pattern? Actually, we do have to have the first, second, and fifth letters fixed. So we must use C, R, E in the first, second, and fifth positions.

So, our next guess must be a word that starts with C, has R as the second letter, and ends with E.

We can choose a word that uses new letters for the third and fourth positions.

Let me choose CRIME: 
- C, R, I, M, E -> but note the pattern: first letter C, second R, fifth E, so third and fourth are I and M.

But we are not sure if I and M are in the word. By guessing CRIME, we can test I and M.

Another option: CRUDE (U and D).

But CRIME is more common.

Alternatively, we could try to cover more vowels? The word so far has vowels: A (eliminated) and E (present). The vowels we haven't tested are I, O, U. So testing I (a vowel) might be good.

So, I'll go with CRIME.

But note: we are not forced to use the pattern? Actually, we are: because we know the first, second, and fifth letters are fixed. So we must use C, R, E in those positions.

So, our next guess: CRIME.

But let me check: is CRIME a valid word? Yes.

So, the guess is ""crime"".

But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that A and N are not in the word. So in CRIME, we are using I and M, which are new.

After this guess, we will get feedback on I and M.

Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't repeat the same letters? But we don't have many constraints.

Another possibility: we could try to include more common consonants? Like T, S, L, etc.

But note: the third and fourth positions are unknown.

So, let's go with CRIME.

But wait: what about the fourth letter? In CRIME, the fourth letter is M. We don't know if M is in the word.

Alternatively, we could try ""CRUSE"" (if we consider it common enough). But CRUSE is a bit obscure.

Another common word: ""CRIME"" is more common.

So, I'll guess ""CRIME"".

But note: we are not required to use the pattern? Actually, we are: because we know the first, second, and fifth letters are fixed. So we must use C, R, E in those positions.

So, the next guess must be a word that starts with C, has R as the second letter, and ends with E.

Therefore, we choose ""CRIME"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C(✓): The first letter is C.
- R(✓): The second letter is R.
- A(x): A is not in the word.
- N(x): N is not in the word.
- E(✓): The fifth letter is E.

The secret word follows the pattern: C R _ _ E, and does not contain A or N. For the next guess, I need to test new letters for the third and fourth positions. I chose ""crime"" because:
- It fits the pattern (C R _ _ E) with new letters (I and M) in the third and fourth positions.
- It tests I (a vowel) and M (a consonant) that haven't been tried yet.
- It avoids A and N, which are eliminated.

This guess will provide feedback on whether I or M are in the word and in the correct positions.

- It fits the pattern (C R _ _ E) with new letters (I and M) in the third and fourth positions.
- It tests I (a vowel) and M (a consonant) that haven't been tried yet.
- It avoids A and N, which are eliminated.

This guess will provide feedback on whether I or M are in the word and in the correct positions.

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: ✓ (correct position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

Guess 2: ""crime""
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: ✓ (correct position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- M: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

From this, we know:
- The word is of the form: C R _ _ E
- The word does not contain: A, N, I, M (from the x's)
- The letters C, R, E are in the word and in the correct positions (first, second, fifth).

We need to find a word that fits C R _ _ E, and the third and fourth letters are not A, N, I, M.

We have eliminated the letters: A, N, I, M.

Now, we need to think of common letters that can be in the third and fourth positions. The third position could be a vowel or consonant, and the fourth position is a consonant (since it's the fourth letter in a 5-letter word).

Possible vowels for the third position: O, U, Y (since A, E, I are already considered; E is present but already in the fifth position, and A and I are eliminated). But note: E is in the word but already at the end, so it could appear again? But the feedback doesn't indicate duplicate letters. However, we must be cautious.

In the first guess, we had E at the end and it was correct, but that doesn't prevent E from appearing elsewhere? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" had E as correct only at the end. But note: if there were another E, it might have been indicated? However, in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback can be tricky. But in this case, we don't have any indication of duplicate E. So we should consider that E might appear again? But typically, we assume no duplicates until feedback suggests otherwise.

But in our second guess ""crime"", we had E at the end and it was correct, and no other E. So for now, let's assume no duplicate E.

Similarly, for the third and fourth positions, we have to choose letters that are not A, N, I, M.

Let's list possible letters for the third and fourth positions. The word must be a valid English word.

Pattern: C R _ _ E

Third position: can be any letter except A, N, I, E (if we assume no duplicate E) and fourth position: any letter except A, N, I, M.

Common letters that we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to form a word. Let's think of words that fit C R _ _ E.

Some possibilities:
- CRUDE: C R U D E -> third letter U, fourth letter D. But we haven't tried U and D.
- CRONE: invalid because of N (eliminated).
- CRATE: invalid because of A (eliminated) and T? But A is out, so no.
- CRIME: we tried, and it had I and M which are eliminated.
- CRANE: we tried and had A and N eliminated.

Other words:
- CRIBE? Not a word.
- CRICE? Not a word.
- CRUDE is a word (meaning: a person who is excessively proper or modest).

Also, ""CRUSE"" (a container) but that might be too obscure.

Another: ""CRATE"" is invalid because of A.

What about ""CRONE""? No, because of N.

""CRIME"" is out.

""CRANE"" is out.

So, ""CRUDE"" is a candidate. But let's check: C R U D E.

We haven't tried U and D. And the pattern matches.

But is there another word? ""CRIBE"" doesn't exist. ""CRICE"" doesn't exist.

""CRUDE"" seems a good option.

But note: in the first guess, we had E at the end, and now we are putting E at the end again? Actually, the fifth letter is fixed as E, so it must be E at the end.

In ""CRUDE"", the fifth letter is E, so it fits.

But we must consider: what if the word has a double letter? We don't have any indication of that yet.

Another word: ""CRATE"" is invalid.

""CRIME"" is invalid.

""CRANE"" is invalid.

So, ""CRUDE"" is a possibility.

But let me see if there are other words.

What about ""CRONE""? No, because of N.

""CRATE"" is invalid.

""CRIBE"" doesn't exist.

""CRICE"" doesn't exist.

""CRUDE"" is the most common word that fits.

But we have to make sure that U and D are not eliminated. They are not in the eliminated list (A, N, I, M).

So, we can guess ""CRUDE"".

But note: we are only on the third guess, and we have two unknowns. We can try to solve it.

Alternatively, we could use a word that tests more new letters? But we have to fit the pattern.

We have to use the pattern: C R _ _ E.

So, we must choose a word that starts with C, has R second, and ends with E, with two new letters in the middle.

We have two positions to fill: third and fourth.

We can try ""CRUDE"" to test U and D.

But if we are wrong, we get feedback on U and D.

Another word: ""CRWTH"" doesn't end with E.

""CRIBE"" is not a word.

""CRICE"" is not a word.

""CRUDE"" is the only common word I can think of.

But what about ""CRATE""? No, because of A.

""CRIME"" is out.

""CRANE"" is out.

So, I think ""CRUDE"" is the best guess.

But let me confirm: is ""CRUDE"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

So, we'll guess ""CRUDE"".

But note: we are not forced to use the pattern? Actually, we are: because we know the first, second, and fifth letters are fixed. So we must use C, R, E in those positions.

So, the next guess is ""CRUDE"".

But wait, what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, if the word is ""CRATE"", but A is eliminated, so no.

Or ""CRIME"", no.

So, ""CRUDE"" is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, we guess ""CRUDE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(✓), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → Secret word pattern: C R _ _ E, and A/N are eliminated.
- **Guess 2 (""crime"")**: C(✓), R(✓), I(x), M(x), E(✓) → Confirms pattern C R _ _ E, and I/M are eliminated.

**Key insights**:
- The secret word is C R _ _ E.
- Eliminated letters: A, N, I, M.
- Remaining unknowns: 3rd and 4th letters (must be letters not eliminated, e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.).

**Strategy for next guess**:
- Must fit the pattern C R _ _ E.
- Test new high-frequency letters for the 3rd and 4th positions to maximize information.
- ""CRUDE"" (C R U D E) is a strong candidate:
  - Uses new letters U and D (both untested and common).
  - Fits the pattern perfectly.
  - Avoids eliminated letters (A, N, I, M).

If correct, this could solve the puzzle. If not, feedback on U/D will narrow down possibilities significantly.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: ✓ (correct position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

So, the secret word has the following pattern:
- The first letter is C.
- The second letter is R.
- The fifth letter is E.
- The letters A and N are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: C R _ _ E

We know that the word does not contain A or N. Also, since A and N are not in the word, we can eliminate any words that have A or N.

Now, we need to think of possible letters for the third and fourth positions. The third position is unknown, and the fourth position is unknown.

We should choose a word that fits the pattern C R _ _ E and uses letters that are not A or N, and also tries to cover new common letters to get more information.

Let's list some common letters that we haven't tried yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we have to form a valid English word.

We also know that the word must have exactly 5 letters and be a valid English word.

Possible words that fit C R _ _ E:

- CRIME: C R I M E -> but we have to check if I and M are allowed? We haven't eliminated them.
- CRUDE: C R U D E
- CRATE: but A is already eliminated, so no.
- CRANE: we already tried, and it had A and N which are eliminated.

Other possibilities: 
- CRIBE? (not a word)
- CRICE? (not a word)
- CRIME: yes.
- CRUDE: yes.
- CRWTH? (not common, and doesn't end with E)

We can also consider words that might have repeated letters? But the feedback didn't show any duplicates so far.

Another idea: since we know the first, second, and fifth letters, we can try to guess the third and fourth letters.

But note: we have two unknowns in the third and fourth positions.

We should choose a word that uses new letters to maximize the chance of getting more information.

Let me think of common words that fit C R _ _ E:

- CRIME: uses I and M.
- CRUDE: uses U and D.
- CRATE: uses A and T, but A is eliminated -> invalid.
- CRANE: uses A and N -> invalid.
- CRIBE: not a word.
- CRICE: not a word.
- CRIME and CRUDE are the main ones.

But there are others: 
- CRONE? -> but O is new, and N is eliminated -> invalid.
- CRUSE? -> uses S and U, but not a common word? And it ends with E? Actually, CRUSE is a word (a container).

But let's stick to common words.

We can also consider: 
- CRATE is out because of A and T? Actually, A is out, but T is new? But A is eliminated, so CRATE is invalid.

Another: CRIME seems good.

But note: we have to avoid A and N.

So, let's try CRIME.

But wait, what about the feedback? We are going to get feedback on the third and fourth letters.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't necessarily have the pattern? Actually, we do have to have the first, second, and fifth letters fixed. So we must use C, R, E in the first, second, and fifth positions.

So, our next guess must be a word that starts with C, has R as the second letter, and ends with E.

We can choose a word that uses new letters for the third and fourth positions.

Let me choose CRIME: 
- C, R, I, M, E -> but note the pattern: first letter C, second R, fifth E, so third and fourth are I and M.

But we are not sure if I and M are in the word. By guessing CRIME, we can test I and M.

Another option: CRUDE (U and D).

But CRIME is more common.

Alternatively, we could try to cover more vowels? The word so far has vowels: A (eliminated) and E (present). The vowels we haven't tested are I, O, U. So testing I (a vowel) might be good.

So, I'll go with CRIME.

But note: we are not forced to use the pattern? Actually, we are: because we know the first, second, and fifth letters are fixed. So we must use C, R, E in those positions.

So, our next guess: CRIME.

But let me check: is CRIME a valid word? Yes.

So, the guess is ""crime"".

But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that A and N are not in the word. So in CRIME, we are using I and M, which are new.

After this guess, we will get feedback on I and M.

Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't repeat the same letters? But we don't have many constraints.

Another possibility: we could try to include more common consonants? Like T, S, L, etc.

But note: the third and fourth positions are unknown.

So, let's go with CRIME.

But wait: what about the fourth letter? In CRIME, the fourth letter is M. We don't know if M is in the word.

Alternatively, we could try ""CRUSE"" (if we consider it common enough). But CRUSE is a bit obscure.

Another common word: ""CRIME"" is more common.

So, I'll guess ""CRIME"".

But note: we are not required to use the pattern? Actually, we are: because we know the first, second, and fifth letters are fixed. So we must use C, R, E in those positions.

So, the next guess must be a word that starts with C, has R as the second letter, and ends with E.

Therefore, we choose ""CRIME"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C(✓): The first letter is C.
- R(✓): The second letter is R.
- A(x): A is not in the word.
- N(x): N is not in the word.
- E(✓): The fifth letter is E.

The secret word follows the pattern: C R _ _ E, and does not contain A or N. For the next guess, I need to test new letters for the third and fourth positions. I chose ""crime"" because:
- It fits the pattern (C R _ _ E) with new letters (I and M) in the third and fourth positions.
- It tests I (a vowel) and M (a consonant) that haven't been tried yet.
- It avoids A and N, which are eliminated.

This guess will provide feedback on whether I or M are in the word and in the correct positions.

<guess>crime</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: crime -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) I(x) M(x) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: ✓ (correct position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

Guess 2: ""crime""
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: ✓ (correct position)
- I: x (not in the word)
- M: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

From this, we know:
- The word is of the form: C R _ _ E
- The word does not contain: A, N, I, M (from the x's)
- The letters C, R, E are in the word and in the correct positions (first, second, fifth).

We need to find a word that fits C R _ _ E, and the third and fourth letters are not A, N, I, M.

We have eliminated the letters: A, N, I, M.

Now, we need to think of common letters that can be in the third and fourth positions. The third position could be a vowel or consonant, and the fourth position is a consonant (since it's the fourth letter in a 5-letter word).

Possible vowels for the third position: O, U, Y (since A, E, I are already considered; E is present but already in the fifth position, and A and I are eliminated). But note: E is in the word but already at the end, so it could appear again? But the feedback doesn't indicate duplicate letters. However, we must be cautious.

In the first guess, we had E at the end and it was correct, but that doesn't prevent E from appearing elsewhere? Actually, the feedback for ""crane"" had E as correct only at the end. But note: if there were another E, it might have been indicated? However, in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback can be tricky. But in this case, we don't have any indication of duplicate E. So we should consider that E might appear again? But typically, we assume no duplicates until feedback suggests otherwise.

But in our second guess ""crime"", we had E at the end and it was correct, and no other E. So for now, let's assume no duplicate E.

Similarly, for the third and fourth positions, we have to choose letters that are not A, N, I, M.

Let's list possible letters for the third and fourth positions. The word must be a valid English word.

Pattern: C R _ _ E

Third position: can be any letter except A, N, I, E (if we assume no duplicate E) and fourth position: any letter except A, N, I, M.

Common letters that we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to form a word. Let's think of words that fit C R _ _ E.

Some possibilities:
- CRUDE: C R U D E -> third letter U, fourth letter D. But we haven't tried U and D.
- CRONE: invalid because of N (eliminated).
- CRATE: invalid because of A (eliminated) and T? But A is out, so no.
- CRIME: we tried, and it had I and M which are eliminated.
- CRANE: we tried and had A and N eliminated.

Other words:
- CRIBE? Not a word.
- CRICE? Not a word.
- CRUDE is a word (meaning: a person who is excessively proper or modest).

Also, ""CRUSE"" (a container) but that might be too obscure.

Another: ""CRATE"" is invalid because of A.

What about ""CRONE""? No, because of N.

""CRIME"" is out.

""CRANE"" is out.

So, ""CRUDE"" is a candidate. But let's check: C R U D E.

We haven't tried U and D. And the pattern matches.

But is there another word? ""CRIBE"" doesn't exist. ""CRICE"" doesn't exist.

""CRUDE"" seems a good option.

But note: in the first guess, we had E at the end, and now we are putting E at the end again? Actually, the fifth letter is fixed as E, so it must be E at the end.

In ""CRUDE"", the fifth letter is E, so it fits.

But we must consider: what if the word has a double letter? We don't have any indication of that yet.

Another word: ""CRATE"" is invalid.

""CRIME"" is invalid.

""CRANE"" is invalid.

So, ""CRUDE"" is a possibility.

But let me see if there are other words.

What about ""CRONE""? No, because of N.

""CRATE"" is invalid.

""CRIBE"" doesn't exist.

""CRICE"" doesn't exist.

""CRUDE"" is the most common word that fits.

But we have to make sure that U and D are not eliminated. They are not in the eliminated list (A, N, I, M).

So, we can guess ""CRUDE"".

But note: we are only on the third guess, and we have two unknowns. We can try to solve it.

Alternatively, we could use a word that tests more new letters? But we have to fit the pattern.

We have to use the pattern: C R _ _ E.

So, we must choose a word that starts with C, has R second, and ends with E, with two new letters in the middle.

We have two positions to fill: third and fourth.

We can try ""CRUDE"" to test U and D.

But if we are wrong, we get feedback on U and D.

Another word: ""CRWTH"" doesn't end with E.

""CRIBE"" is not a word.

""CRICE"" is not a word.

""CRUDE"" is the only common word I can think of.

But what about ""CRATE""? No, because of A.

""CRIME"" is out.

""CRANE"" is out.

So, I think ""CRUDE"" is the best guess.

But let me confirm: is ""CRUDE"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

So, we'll guess ""CRUDE"".

But note: we are not forced to use the pattern? Actually, we are: because we know the first, second, and fifth letters are fixed. So we must use C, R, E in those positions.

So, the next guess is ""CRUDE"".

But wait, what if the word has a duplicate letter? For example, if the word is ""CRATE"", but A is eliminated, so no.

Or ""CRIME"", no.

So, ""CRUDE"" is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, we guess ""CRUDE"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C(✓), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(✓) → Secret word pattern: C R _ _ E, and A/N are eliminated.
- **Guess 2 (""crime"")**: C(✓), R(✓), I(x), M(x), E(✓) → Confirms pattern C R _ _ E, and I/M are eliminated.

**Key insights**:
- The secret word is C R _ _ E.
- Eliminated letters: A, N, I, M.
- Remaining unknowns: 3rd and 4th letters (must be letters not eliminated, e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.).

**Strategy for next guess**:
- Must fit the pattern C R _ _ E.
- Test new high-frequency letters for the 3rd and 4th positions to maximize information.
- ""CRUDE"" (C R U D E) is a strong candidate:
  - Uses new letters U and D (both untested and common).
  - Fits the pattern perfectly.
  - Avoids eliminated letters (A, N, I, M).

If correct, this could solve the puzzle. If not, feedback on U/D will narrow down possibilities significantly.

We must form a word that fits C R _ _ E, using letters that are not eliminated.

What letters are available? We have eliminated: A, N, I, M, U, D.

The remaining letters: B, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to choose a word that uses two of these letters for the third and fourth positions.

Now, what are possible words?
- We need to find words that match C R ? ? E.

Some possibilities (using the available letters):
- CRD?E -> but D is eliminated, so no.
- CRF?E -> F is available, but what words? CRFE? Not a word.
- CRG?E -> CRGE? Not a word.
- CRH?E -> CRHE? Not a word.
- CRORE? But that's 5 letters? C R O R E -> but that has two R's? And the pattern is C R _ _ E, so the fourth letter must be the second R? But in ""CRORE"", the second letter is R, but the third letter is O, and the fourth is R? That would be C R O R E. But we don't know if R can be duplicated? The feedback hasn't indicated duplicate letters so far, but it's possible.

But note: in the first guess, we had R in the second position and it was correct, but that doesn't prevent R from being in the fourth position? Actually, if the word had two R's, then in the first guess we would have seen only one R (in the second position) and the fourth R would not have been indicated? Because in the first guess, we only had one R. Similarly, in the second and third guesses, we only had one R. So we don't know if there is a second R.

But in ""CRORE"", the third letter is O and the fourth is R. However, we have to check if O and R are available. R is already in the word (in the second position), so duplicating R is possible.

But let's see: the eliminated letters are A, N, I, M, U, D. So R is not eliminated, so it can appear again.

Similarly, E is already in the fifth position, but it could appear again? However, in the third guess, we had E at the end and it was correct, but that doesn't prevent E from being in other positions? Actually, the feedback for the third guess: we had E at the end and it was correct, but if there were another E, we wouldn't know. But we haven't tested any other E positions.

But in the pattern, the third and fourth positions are unknown, so E could be in those positions? But we have to form a word.

Now, what about the word ""CRORE""? It is a valid word (meaning: a large number or a profit from land, etc.). It fits the pattern: C R O R E.

But we have to check if O and R are available. R is already in the word (second position), so duplicating R is allowed. And O is a new letter.

But we have eliminated U and D, but not O.

So, ""CRORE"" is a candidate.

But let's see if there are other words.

Another word: ""CRWTH"" is not ending with E.

""CRIBE"" is not a word.

""CRICE"" is not a word.

""CRUDE"" we tried and D and U are out.

What about ""CRATE""? A is out, so no.

""CRIME"" is out.

""CRANE"" is out.

So, ""CRORE"" seems a good option.

But we have two R's? In ""CRORE"", the second letter is R and the fourth is R. So we are using R twice.

But the feedback hasn't indicated that R is duplicated. However, it's possible.

Another word: ""CRONE"" is out because of N.

""CRUSE"" is a word (a container) but ends with E? C R U S E -> but U is eliminated, so no.

""CRUSE"" has U, which is eliminated.

What about ""CRIBE""? Not a word.

""CRICE"" not a word.

""CRUDE"" we tried.

Another possibility: ""CRWTH"" is not ending with E.

""CRYME""? Not a word.

""CRATE"" is out.

So, ""CRORE"" is the only common word I can think of.

But what about ""CRONE""? No, because of N.

""CRIME"" is out.

""CRANE"" is out.

Therefore, I think ""CRORE"" is the best guess.

But let me double-check: the pattern is C R _ _ E, and we are using O for the third position and R for the fourth.

We haven't tried O or R in other positions? Actually, R is already in the word, but we don't know if it can be duplicated.

Alternatively, we could try a word with two new letters.

But with the available letters, ""CRORE"" is the only common word.

Another word: ""CRIBE"" is not valid. ""CRICE"" not valid.

""CRUDE"" we tried.

What about ""CRWTH""? Not ending with E.

""CRYME""? Not a word.

""CRATE"" is out.

So, I think we should guess ""CRORE"".

But note: we are on the fourth guess. We have two unknowns, and we are using R twice. But if the word is ""CRORE"", we might get it.

But let's see if there is a word with two different new letters.

For example, ""CRIBE"" is not valid. ""CRICE"" not valid.

""CRUDE"" we tried.

Another idea: ""CRONE"" is out.

""CRUSE"" has U, out.

""CRATE"" has A, out.

""CRIME"" has I, out.

""CRANE"" has A and N, out.

So, ""CRORE"" is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, we guess ""CRORE"".

But wait, what about ""CRIBE""? No, not a word. ""CRICE"" no.

""CRUDE"" we know is not.

So, let's go with ""CRORE"".

But note: in ""CRORE"", the third letter is O and the fourth is R. We haven't tried O or R in other positions, but R is already in the word (second position), so duplicating R is possible.

If the word is ""CRORE"", then the third letter O and the fourth letter R.

But we must confirm: is ""CRORE"" a valid word? Yes.

So, the next guess is ""CRORE"".

But we are not sure if the fourth letter is R. We are testing it.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses two different letters to maximize information, but we don't have many options.

Another word: ""CRWTH"" is not ending with E.

""CRYME"" not a word.

""CRATE"" not.

So, I think ""CRORE"" is the only common word.

Therefore, we guess ""CRORE"".

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Pattern confirmed**: The secret word is **C R _ _ E**.
- **Eliminated letters**: A, N, I, M, U, D (all marked ""x"" in feedback).
- **Remaining unknowns**: The third and fourth letters must be letters not in the eliminated list (e.g., B, F, G, H, K, L, O, P, S, T, V, W, Y, etc.).

**Analysis for next guess**:
- The word must be **C R ? ? E**.
- Possible words are limited due to eliminated letters (A, N, I, M, U, D).
- After eliminating possibilities like ""CRANE"" (A, N), ""CRIME"" (I, M), and ""CRUDE"" (U, D), the only common English word fitting the pattern and constraints is **""CRORE""** (meaning: a large number or profit from land).
  - **CRORE**: Uses O (third position) and R (fourth position), both new and available.
  - This guess tests for duplicate R (if R appears in the fourth position) and checks O as a potential vowel.

If ""CRORE"" is correct, it solves the puzzle. If not, feedback on O and the fourth letter R will significantly narrow down possibilities (e.g., if O is present but wrong position, or if R is invalid in the fourth position, etc.).

<guess>crore</guess>",crore,"We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(✓), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
  - This told us that the word is C R _ _ E, and A and N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""crime"" -> C(✓), R(✓), I(x), M(x), E(✓)
  - Confirmed the pattern C R _ _ E, and I and M are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""crude"" -> C(✓), R(✓), U(x), D(x), E(✓)

So now we know:
