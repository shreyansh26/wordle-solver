We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C and A are not in the secret word.
 - The letters R, N, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

 Since R, N, E are in the word, but not in the positions we had (which were positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively in ""crane""), we must place them in other positions.

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C or A.

 Our next guess should:
 1. Include R, N, E (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
 2. Avoid using C and A.
 3. We can try to use other common letters to get more information.

 In the first guess, we had:
   Position 1: C (x) -> so the first letter is not C, and also not R (because R is present but in the wrong position, and we know R is in the word and not in position 2? Actually, wait: the feedback for R was a dash (-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, N is in the word but not in position 4, and E not in position 5.

 But note: the word ""crane"" has positions:
   1: C
   2: R
   3: A
   4: N
   5: E

 So R cannot be at position 2, N cannot be at position 4, E cannot be at position 5.

 Now, we need to form a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C or A.
   - Contains R, N, E (and two other letters that we haven't tried yet? Actually, we don't know how many letters the word has, but we know it has at least R, N, E).

 We have three known letters: R, N, E. We need to place them in positions that are not forbidden and also avoid positions where they were misplaced.

 However, note: the feedback does not tell us that R, N, E must appear again? Actually, they might appear again? But we don't have any indication of duplicates. Since we only got one dash per letter, and the word has 5 letters, it's possible that each occurrence is accounted for. But we don't know for sure.

 But the feedback rules: if a letter is repeated, it might be marked accordingly. However, in this case, we don't have any repeated letters in ""crane"", so we don't know.

 We should assume that the word contains exactly one occurrence of R, one of N, and one of E? But that might not be true. However, without evidence of duplicates, we can try to avoid them for now.

 We have to choose a word that has R, N, E and two other letters (which must not be C or A).

 We also know the positions where R, N, E cannot be:
   R cannot be at position 2.
   N cannot be at position 4.
   E cannot be at position 5.

 We can try to put R, N, E in other positions.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: we haven't tried B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 One common strategy is to try a word that uses the known letters and also tests some new letters.

 We know R, N, E must be in the word. We can try to form a word that rearranges R, N, E and adds two new letters.

 But note: we have three letters to place and we know they cannot be in positions 2,4,5 respectively? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the first guess:
   R was in position 2 and that was wrong -> so R must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5? But wait, we now know that R is not in position 2? Actually, from the feedback: R was marked as present but not in position 2. So R can be in positions 1,3,4,5? However, we also know that position 1 was C (which is absent) and position 3 was A (absent). So R could be in position 1 or 3? But note: we don't know what is at position 1 and 3.

 Similarly, N was at position 4 and that was wrong, so N cannot be at position 4? Actually, the feedback says N is in the word but not at position 4. So N must be in one of positions 1,2,3,5? But we also know that position 1 might be R? Or we can try N at position 1? However, we don't know.

 We need to choose a word that:
   - Contains R, N, E (each at least once) and two new letters.
   - The new letters should be common.

 Let's try to form a word that has R, N, E and two other letters that are common and we haven't tried.

 Example: we could try ""RENEW"" but that has two E's and we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Also, we have E at position 2 and 4? But we know E is in the word but not at position 5? And we don't know about duplicates.

 Alternatively, we can try ""DRIVE"": 
   D, R, I, V, E.
   This includes R (at position 2? but wait, in ""crane"" R was at position 2 and we know that was wrong. Now in ""DRIVE"", R is at position 2 again? That would be the same position. So we must avoid putting R at position 2.

 How about ""RODEO""? But that has O and D and O again? And R at position 1. But we also have A? We know A is absent, so we cannot use A. So ""RODEO"" is invalid because it contains A? Actually, ""RODEO"" has O and D and O again? And no A? Wait, ""RODEO"" has O and D, but also O again? And it doesn't have A. But we also have to avoid C? This word doesn't have C or A. However, we know that the secret word has R, N, E. But ""RODEO"" does not have N. So that won't work.

 We need a word that has R, N, E and two other letters.

 Let me try ""RINSE"": 
   R at position 1 (which is not position 2, so okay for R? But wait, we don't know if R can be at position 1? The feedback only said R is not at position 2. So position 1 is allowed for R.
   I, N, S, E: N at position 3? (which is not position 4, so okay), E at position 5? But the feedback said E is not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5.

 How about ""RENTS"": 
   R at 1 (okay, not position 2)
   E at 2 (we don't know if E can be at position 2? The feedback only said E is not at position 5. So position 2 is allowed for E.)
   N at 3 (not position 4, so okay)
   T and S are new.

 But wait: the word ""RENTS"" has E at position 2. We don't know if that is correct? We are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SNORE"": 
   S, N, O, R, E.
   Positions: 
      S at 1
      N at 2 (allowed? since N was at position 4 in the first guess and that was wrong, but position 2 is new and okay)
      O at 3
      R at 4 (not position 2, so okay for R)
      E at 5 -> but feedback said E is not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5.

 So we avoid E at position 5.

 Another idea: ""INERT"": 
   I, N, E, R, T.
   Positions:
      I at 1
      N at 2 (allowed? yes, because previously N was at 4 and that was wrong, but position 2 is new)
      E at 3 (not position 5, so okay)
      R at 4 (not position 2, so okay)
      T at 5.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that R, N, E are in the word. So we have R, N, E in the word. Also, we are testing I and T.

 However, we must also consider: the word must be a valid English word.

 But wait: we have to avoid the letters C and A. ""INERT"" doesn't have C or A.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ENTER"": 
   E at 1 -> but we don't know if E can be at position 1? The feedback only said E is not at position 5. So position 1 is allowed for E.
   N at 2 (allowed? yes, because previously N was at 4 and that was wrong, but position 2 is new)
   T at 3
   E at 4? Wait, we have two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's. We only know that E is present (at least one). 
   R at 5? But we know R is present and we are putting it at position 5? The feedback didn't say anything about position 5 for R? Actually, the feedback for R was only that it is not at position 2. So position 5 is allowed for R.

 However, we are using E at position 1 and 4? And we don't know if the word has two E's. We might get confusing feedback.

 Let me avoid duplicate letters for now to get clearer feedback.

 How about ""NEVER"": 
   N at 1 -> allowed? (previously was at 4, so position 1 is new)
   E at 2 -> allowed? (we don't know about position 2 for E? The feedback only said E is not at position 5. So position 2 is okay)
   V at 3
   E at 4 -> but we are using E twice? We don't know if the word has two E's.
   R at 5 -> allowed? (since R was forbidden at position 2, and position 5 is new)

 But we are repeating E. We might get feedback that E is at position 2? But we don't know if that's correct.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RINSE"" again? But we already have a second guess.

 Another idea: ""SENOR"": 
   S, E, N, O, R.
   Positions:
      S at 1
      E at 2 -> allowed? (E was at position 5 in the first guess and that was wrong, but position 2 is new and okay)
      N at 3 -> allowed? (N was at position 4, so position 3 is new)
      O at 4
      R at 5 -> allowed? (R was at position 2, so position 5 is new)

 This word uses the known letters (R, N, E) and tests S and O. Also, we avoid C and A.

 But note: we have R at position 5? The feedback didn't forbid R at position 5? Actually, the feedback only said R is not at position 2. So position 5 is free.

 However, we must be cautious: we know that E cannot be at position 5? But we are putting E at position 2? That's okay.

 But wait: what about the positions for R, N, E? We are putting:
   R at 5 -> but we don't know if that's the correct position? We are testing.
   N at 3 -> we don't know if that's the correct position? We are testing.

 This seems like a good candidate.

 But let me check: we have to avoid the letters C and A. ""SENOR"" doesn't have them.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROBES"": 
   R at 1 -> allowed? (R was at 2, so 1 is new)
   O at 2
   B at 3
   E at 4 -> allowed? (E was at 5, so 4 is new)
   S at 5

 This also uses R, N, E (but we are using N? Actually, we are not including N? Wait, we have R, E, and we are missing N? So we must include N.

 We must include R, N, E? Actually, we don't have to, but we know they are in the word. So we should include them to get positional information.

 Therefore, we must include R, N, E.

 So ""ROBES"" doesn't have N. So that's invalid.

 How about ""RINSE"": 
   R at 1 -> okay
   I at 2
   N at 3 -> okay (not position 4)
   S at 4
   E at 5 -> but we know E is not at position 5? So we cannot put E at 5.

 How about ""RENTS"": 
   R at 1 -> okay
   E at 2 -> okay
   N at 3 -> okay (not position 4)
   T at 4
   S at 5

 This seems okay.

 But note: we are putting E at position 2. We don't know if that's correct? We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""NERDY"": 
   N at 1 -> allowed? (N was at 4, so 1 is new)
   E at 2 -> allowed? (E was at 5, so 2 is new)
   R at 3 -> allowed? (R was at 2, so 3 is new)
   D at 4
   Y at 5

 This also includes R, N, E.

 But we are using N at position 1, E at 2, R at 3. We haven't tested these positions.

 However, we must avoid the letters C and A. ""NERDY"" doesn't have them.

 But which one is better? ""SENOR"" and ""NERDY"" are both options.

 Let me consider the commonality of letters. We want to test common letters.

 Common consonants: T, S, R, N, D, L, etc.

 We already have R, N, E. We can try to test S and T? 

 ""SENOR"" has S and O. ""NERDY"" has D and Y.

 The letter T is very common. So maybe we should include T.

 How about ""TREND"": 
   T at 1
   R at 2 -> but wait, we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.

 How about ""TRIBE"": 
   T at 1
   R at 2 -> not allowed? Because we know R is not at position 2. So we must avoid R at position 2.

 How about ""STERN"": 
   S, T, E, R, N.
   Positions:
      S at 1
      T at 2
      E at 3 -> allowed? (E was at 5, so 3 is new)
      R at 4 -> allowed? (R was at 2, so 4 is new)
      N at 5 -> allowed? (N was at 4, so 5 is new)

 This seems good: 
   We are including R, N, E (each once? we hope)
   We are testing S and T.

 But note: we are putting N at position 5? The feedback didn't forbid N at position 5? Actually, the feedback only said N is not at position 4. So position 5 is allowed.

 Similarly, E at position 3? Allowed because we don't know about position 3 for E? Actually, we only know E is not at position 5. So position 3 is okay.

 R at position 4? Okay.

 So ""STERN"" is a good candidate.

 Another candidate: ""ROBED"": 
   R at 1 -> okay
   O at 2
   B at 3
   E at 4 -> okay (E was at 5, so 4 is new)
   D at 5

 But we are missing N? So we don't get information about N.

 We must include R, N, E. So ""STERN"" is better because it includes all three.

 Let me check if ""STERN"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

 So I choose ""STERN"".

 But note: we are using R, N, E, and we are testing S and T. Also, we are avoiding C and A.

 Therefore, our next guess: ""STERN""

 We'll get feedback on:
   S (at position 1): could be correct? or present? or absent?
   T (at position 2): same.
   E (at position 3): we know E is in the word, but is it at position 3?
   R (at position 4): is it at position 4?
   N (at position 5): is it at position 5?

 And we test S and T.

 This seems a good use of a guess.

 Alternatively, we could try ""RINSE"" (which we mentioned earlier) but we already have a second guess and we want to test more common letters.

 I think ""STERN"" is a good choice.

 So I'll go with ""STERN"".

<guess>stern</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **A** are absent (marked ""x""), so they can be excluded.
- **R**, **N**, and **E** are present (marked ""-"") but misplaced. Specifically:
  - R cannot be at position 2.
  - N cannot be at position 4.
  - E cannot be at position 5.

For the next guess:
- Must include **R**, **N**, and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
- Avoid **C** and **A**.
- Test new common letters (e.g., **S** and **T**) to gather more information.
- Prioritize placing R, N, E in new positions that fit the constraints (e.g., R not at position 2, N not at position 4, E not at position 5).

The word **""STERN""** fits perfectly:
- Includes R, N, E.
- Tests S and T (common letters).
- Avoids C and A.
- Positions: 
  - R is at position 4 (not 2).
  - N is at position 5 (not 4).
  - E is at position 3 (not 5).

This guess maximizes information by:
- Testing R, N, E in untried positions.
- Introducing two new common consonants (S and T).
- Avoiding forbidden letters (C and A).

<guess>stern</guess>",stern,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C and A are not in the secret word.
 - The letters R, N, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

 Since R, N, E are in the word, but not in the positions we had (which were positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively in ""crane""), we must place them in other positions.

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C or A.

 Our next guess should:
 1. Include R, N, E (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
 2. Avoid using C and A.
 3. We can try to use other common letters to get more information.

 In the first guess, we had:
   Position 1: C (x) -> so the first letter is not C, and also not R (because R is present but in the wrong position, and we know R is in the word and not in position 2? Actually, wait: the feedback for R was a dash (-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, N is in the word but not in position 4, and E not in position 5.

 But note: the word ""crane"" has positions:
   1: C
   2: R
   3: A
   4: N
   5: E

 So R cannot be at position 2, N cannot be at position 4, E cannot be at position 5.

 Now, we need to form a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C or A.
   - Contains R, N, E (and two other letters that we haven't tried yet? Actually, we don't know how many letters the word has, but we know it has at least R, N, E).

 We have three known letters: R, N, E. We need to place them in positions that are not forbidden and also avoid positions where they were misplaced.

   N cannot be at position 4.
   E cannot be at position 5.

 We can try to put R, N, E in other positions.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: we haven't tried B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 One common strategy is to try a word that uses the known letters and also tests some new letters.

 We know R, N, E must be in the word. We can try to form a word that rearranges R, N, E and adds two new letters.

 But note: we have three letters to place and we know they cannot be in positions 2,4,5 respectively? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the first guess:
   R was in position 2 and that was wrong -> so R must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5? But wait, we now know that R is not in position 2? Actually, from the feedback: R was marked as present but not in position 2. So R can be in positions 1,3,4,5? However, we also know that position 1 was C (which is absent) and position 3 was A (absent). So R could be in position 1 or 3? But note: we don't know what is at position 1 and 3.

 Similarly, N was at position 4 and that was wrong, so N cannot be at position 4? Actually, the feedback says N is in the word but not at position 4. So N must be in one of positions 1,2,3,5? But we also know that position 1 might be R? Or we can try N at position 1? However, we don't know.

 We need to choose a word that:
   - Contains R, N, E (each at least once) and two new letters.
   - The new letters should be common.

 Let's try to form a word that has R, N, E and two other letters that are common and we haven't tried.

 Example: we could try ""RENEW"" but that has two E's and we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Also, we have E at position 2 and 4? But we know E is in the word but not at position 5? And we don't know about duplicates.

 Alternatively, we can try ""DRIVE"": 
   D, R, I, V, E.
   This includes R (at position 2? but wait, in ""crane"" R was at position 2 and we know that was wrong. Now in ""DRIVE"", R is at position 2 again? That would be the same position. So we must avoid putting R at position 2.

 How about ""RODEO""? But that has O and D and O again? And R at position 1. But we also have A? We know A is absent, so we cannot use A. So ""RODEO"" is invalid because it contains A? Actually, ""RODEO"" has O and D and O again? And no A? Wait, ""RODEO"" has O and D, but also O again? And it doesn't have A. But we also have to avoid C? This word doesn't have C or A. However, we know that the secret word has R, N, E. But ""RODEO"" does not have N. So that won't work.

 We need a word that has R, N, E and two other letters.

 Let me try ""RINSE"": 
   R at position 1 (which is not position 2, so okay for R? But wait, we don't know if R can be at position 1? The feedback only said R is not at position 2. So position 1 is allowed for R.
   I, N, S, E: N at position 3? (which is not position 4, so okay), E at position 5? But the feedback said E is not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5.

 How about ""RENTS"": 
   R at 1 (okay, not position 2)
   E at 2 (we don't know if E can be at position 2? The feedback only said E is not at position 5. So position 2 is allowed for E.)
   N at 3 (not position 4, so okay)
   T and S are new.

 But wait: the word ""RENTS"" has E at position 2. We don't know if that is correct? We are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SNORE"": 
   S, N, O, R, E.
   Positions: 
      S at 1
      N at 2 (allowed? since N was at position 4 in the first guess and that was wrong, but position 2 is new and okay)
      O at 3
      R at 4 (not position 2, so okay for R)
      E at 5 -> but feedback said E is not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5.

 So we avoid E at position 5.

 Another idea: ""INERT"": 
   I, N, E, R, T.
   Positions:
      I at 1
      N at 2 (allowed? yes, because previously N was at 4 and that was wrong, but position 2 is new)
      E at 3 (not position 5, so okay)
      R at 4 (not position 2, so okay)
      T at 5.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that R, N, E are in the word. So we have R, N, E in the word. Also, we are testing I and T.

 However, we must also consider: the word must be a valid English word.

 But wait: we have to avoid the letters C and A. ""INERT"" doesn't have C or A.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ENTER"": 
   E at 1 -> but we don't know if E can be at position 1? The feedback only said E is not at position 5. So position 1 is allowed for E.
   N at 2 (allowed? yes, because previously N was at 4 and that was wrong, but position 2 is new)
   T at 3
   E at 4? Wait, we have two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's. We only know that E is present (at least one). 
   R at 5? But we know R is present and we are putting it at position 5? The feedback didn't say anything about position 5 for R? Actually, the feedback for R was only that it is not at position 2. So position 5 is allowed for R.

 However, we are using E at position 1 and 4? And we don't know if the word has two E's. We might get confusing feedback.

 Let me avoid duplicate letters for now to get clearer feedback.

 How about ""NEVER"": 
   N at 1 -> allowed? (previously was at 4, so position 1 is new)
   E at 2 -> allowed? (we don't know about position 2 for E? The feedback only said E is not at position 5. So position 2 is okay)
   V at 3
   E at 4 -> but we are using E twice? We don't know if the word has two E's.
   R at 5 -> allowed? (since R was forbidden at position 2, and position 5 is new)

 But we are repeating E. We might get feedback that E is at position 2? But we don't know if that's correct.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RINSE"" again? But we already have a second guess.

 Another idea: ""SENOR"": 
   S, E, N, O, R.
   Positions:
      S at 1
      E at 2 -> allowed? (E was at position 5 in the first guess and that was wrong, but position 2 is new and okay)
      N at 3 -> allowed? (N was at position 4, so position 3 is new)
      O at 4
      R at 5 -> allowed? (R was at position 2, so position 5 is new)

 This word uses the known letters (R, N, E) and tests S and O. Also, we avoid C and A.

 But note: we have R at position 5? The feedback didn't forbid R at position 5? Actually, the feedback only said R is not at position 2. So position 5 is free.

 However, we must be cautious: we know that E cannot be at position 5? But we are putting E at position 2? That's okay.

 But wait: what about the positions for R, N, E? We are putting:
   R at 5 -> but we don't know if that's the correct position? We are testing.
   N at 3 -> we don't know if that's the correct position? We are testing.

 This seems like a good candidate.

 But let me check: we have to avoid the letters C and A. ""SENOR"" doesn't have them.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROBES"": 
   R at 1 -> allowed? (R was at 2, so 1 is new)
   O at 2
   B at 3
   E at 4 -> allowed? (E was at 5, so 4 is new)
   S at 5

 This also uses R, N, E (but we are using N? Actually, we are not including N? Wait, we have R, E, and we are missing N? So we must include N.

 We must include R, N, E? Actually, we don't have to, but we know they are in the word. So we should include them to get positional information.

 Therefore, we must include R, N, E.

 So ""ROBES"" doesn't have N. So that's invalid.

 How about ""RINSE"": 
   R at 1 -> okay
   I at 2
   N at 3 -> okay (not position 4)
   S at 4
   E at 5 -> but we know E is not at position 5? So we cannot put E at 5.

 How about ""RENTS"": 
   R at 1 -> okay
   E at 2 -> okay
   N at 3 -> okay (not position 4)
   T at 4
   S at 5

 This seems okay.

 But note: we are putting E at position 2. We don't know if that's correct? We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""NERDY"": 
   N at 1 -> allowed? (N was at 4, so 1 is new)
   E at 2 -> allowed? (E was at 5, so 2 is new)
   R at 3 -> allowed? (R was at 2, so 3 is new)
   D at 4
   Y at 5

 This also includes R, N, E.

 But we are using N at position 1, E at 2, R at 3. We haven't tested these positions.

 However, we must avoid the letters C and A. ""NERDY"" doesn't have them.

 But which one is better? ""SENOR"" and ""NERDY"" are both options.

 Let me consider the commonality of letters. We want to test common letters.

 Common consonants: T, S, R, N, D, L, etc.

 We already have R, N, E. We can try to test S and T? 

 ""SENOR"" has S and O. ""NERDY"" has D and Y.

 The letter T is very common. So maybe we should include T.

 How about ""TREND"": 
   T at 1
   R at 2 -> but wait, we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.

 How about ""TRIBE"": 
   T at 1
   R at 2 -> not allowed? Because we know R is not at position 2. So we must avoid R at position 2.

 How about ""STERN"": 
   S, T, E, R, N.
   Positions:
      S at 1
      T at 2
      E at 3 -> allowed? (E was at 5, so 3 is new)
      R at 4 -> allowed? (R was at 2, so 4 is new)
      N at 5 -> allowed? (N was at 4, so 5 is new)

 This seems good: 
   We are including R, N, E (each once? we hope)
   We are testing S and T.

 But note: we are putting N at position 5? The feedback didn't forbid N at position 5? Actually, the feedback only said N is not at position 4. So position 5 is allowed.

 Similarly, E at position 3? Allowed because we don't know about position 3 for E? Actually, we only know E is not at position 5. So position 3 is okay.

 R at position 4? Okay.

 So ""STERN"" is a good candidate.

 Another candidate: ""ROBED"": 
   R at 1 -> okay
   O at 2
   B at 3
   E at 4 -> okay (E was at 5, so 4 is new)
   D at 5

 But we are missing N? So we don't get information about N.

 We must include R, N, E. So ""STERN"" is better because it includes all three.

 Let me check if ""STERN"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

 So I choose ""STERN"".

 But note: we are using R, N, E, and we are testing S and T. Also, we are avoiding C and A.

 Therefore, our next guess: ""STERN""

 We'll get feedback on:
   S (at position 1): could be correct? or present? or absent?
   T (at position 2): same.
   E (at position 3): we know E is in the word, but is it at position 3?
   R (at position 4): is it at position 4?
   N (at position 5): is it at position 5?

 And we test S and T.

 This seems a good use of a guess.

 Alternatively, we could try ""RINSE"" (which we mentioned earlier) but we already have a second guess and we want to test more common letters.

 I think ""STERN"" is a good choice.

 So I'll go with ""STERN"".

<guess>stern</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **A** are absent (marked ""x""), so they can be excluded.
- **R**, **N**, and **E** are present (marked ""-"") but misplaced. Specifically:
  - R cannot be at position 2.
  - N cannot be at position 4.
  - E cannot be at position 5.

For the next guess:
- Must include **R**, **N**, and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
- Avoid **C** and **A**.
- Test new common letters (e.g., **S** and **T**) to gather more information.
- Prioritize placing R, N, E in new positions that fit the constraints (e.g., R not at position 2, N not at position 4, E not at position 5).

The word **""STERN""** fits perfectly:
- Includes R, N, E.
- Tests S and T (common letters).
- Avoids C and A.
- Positions: 
  - R is at position 4 (not 2).
  - N is at position 5 (not 4).
  - E is at position 3 (not 5).

This guess maximizes information by:
- Testing R, N, E in untried positions.
- Introducing two new common consonants (S and T).
- Avoiding forbidden letters (C and A).",Guess 2: stern -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) E(-) R(-) N(-),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(-) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C and A are not in the secret word.
 - The letters R, N, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

 Since R, N, E are in the word, but not in the positions we had (which were positions 2, 4, and 5 respectively in ""crane""), we must place them in other positions.

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C or A.

 Our next guess should:
 1. Include R, N, E (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
 2. Avoid using C and A.
 3. We can try to use other common letters to get more information.

 In the first guess, we had:
   Position 1: C (x) -> so the first letter is not C, and also not R (because R is present but in the wrong position, and we know R is in the word and not in position 2? Actually, wait: the feedback for R was a dash (-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, N is in the word but not in position 4, and E not in position 5.

 But note: the word ""crane"" has positions:
   1: C
   2: R
   3: A
   4: N
   5: E

 So R cannot be at position 2, N cannot be at position 4, E cannot be at position 5.

 Now, we need to form a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C or A.
   - Contains R, N, E (and two other letters that we haven't tried yet? Actually, we don't know how many letters the word has, but we know it has at least R, N, E).

 We have three known letters: R, N, E. We need to place them in positions that are not forbidden and also avoid positions where they were misplaced.

 However, note: the feedback does not tell us that R, N, E must appear again? Actually, they might appear again? But we don't have any indication of duplicates. Since we only got one dash per letter, and the word has 5 letters, it's possible that each occurrence is accounted for. But we don't know for sure.

 But the feedback rules: if a letter is repeated, it might be marked accordingly. However, in this case, we don't have any repeated letters in ""crane"", so we don't know.

 We should assume that the word contains exactly one occurrence of R, one of N, and one of E? But that might not be true. However, without evidence of duplicates, we can try to avoid them for now.

 We have to choose a word that has R, N, E and two other letters (which must not be C or A).

 We also know the positions where R, N, E cannot be:
   R cannot be at position 2.
   N cannot be at position 4.
   E cannot be at position 5.

 We can try to put R, N, E in other positions.

 Let's think of common letters that we haven't tried: we haven't tried B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 One common strategy is to try a word that uses the known letters and also tests some new letters.

 We know R, N, E must be in the word. We can try to form a word that rearranges R, N, E and adds two new letters.

 But note: we have three letters to place and we know they cannot be in positions 2,4,5 respectively? Actually, the feedback only tells us that in the first guess:
   R was in position 2 and that was wrong -> so R must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5? But wait, we now know that R is not in position 2? Actually, from the feedback: R was marked as present but not in position 2. So R can be in positions 1,3,4,5? However, we also know that position 1 was C (which is absent) and position 3 was A (absent). So R could be in position 1 or 3? But note: we don't know what is at position 1 and 3.

 Similarly, N was at position 4 and that was wrong, so N cannot be at position 4? Actually, the feedback says N is in the word but not at position 4. So N must be in one of positions 1,2,3,5? But we also know that position 1 might be R? Or we can try N at position 1? However, we don't know.

 We need to choose a word that:
   - Contains R, N, E (each at least once) and two new letters.
   - The new letters should be common.

 Let's try to form a word that has R, N, E and two other letters that are common and we haven't tried.

 Example: we could try ""RENEW"" but that has two E's and we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Also, we have E at position 2 and 4? But we know E is in the word but not at position 5? And we don't know about duplicates.

 Alternatively, we can try ""DRIVE"": 
   D, R, I, V, E.
   This includes R (at position 2? but wait, in ""crane"" R was at position 2 and we know that was wrong. Now in ""DRIVE"", R is at position 2 again? That would be the same position. So we must avoid putting R at position 2.

 How about ""RODEO""? But that has O and D and O again? And R at position 1. But we also have A? We know A is absent, so we cannot use A. So ""RODEO"" is invalid because it contains A? Actually, ""RODEO"" has O and D and O again? And no A? Wait, ""RODEO"" has O and D, but also O again? And it doesn't have A. But we also have to avoid C? This word doesn't have C or A. However, we know that the secret word has R, N, E. But ""RODEO"" does not have N. So that won't work.

 We need a word that has R, N, E and two other letters.

 Let me try ""RINSE"": 
   R at position 1 (which is not position 2, so okay for R? But wait, we don't know if R can be at position 1? The feedback only said R is not at position 2. So position 1 is allowed for R.
   I, N, S, E: N at position 3? (which is not position 4, so okay), E at position 5? But the feedback said E is not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5.

 How about ""RENTS"": 
   R at 1 (okay, not position 2)
   E at 2 (we don't know if E can be at position 2? The feedback only said E is not at position 5. So position 2 is allowed for E.)
   N at 3 (not position 4, so okay)
   T and S are new.

 But wait: the word ""RENTS"" has E at position 2. We don't know if that is correct? We are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SNORE"": 
   S, N, O, R, E.
   Positions: 
      S at 1
      N at 2 (allowed? since N was at position 4 in the first guess and that was wrong, but position 2 is new and okay)
      O at 3
      R at 4 (not position 2, so okay for R)
      E at 5 -> but feedback said E is not at position 5? So we cannot put E at position 5.

 So we avoid E at position 5.

 Another idea: ""INERT"": 
   I, N, E, R, T.
   Positions:
      I at 1
      N at 2 (allowed? yes, because previously N was at 4 and that was wrong, but position 2 is new)
      E at 3 (not position 5, so okay)
      R at 4 (not position 2, so okay)
      T at 5.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that R, N, E are in the word. So we have R, N, E in the word. Also, we are testing I and T.

 However, we must also consider: the word must be a valid English word.

 But wait: we have to avoid the letters C and A. ""INERT"" doesn't have C or A.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ENTER"": 
   E at 1 -> but we don't know if E can be at position 1? The feedback only said E is not at position 5. So position 1 is allowed for E.
   N at 2 (allowed? yes, because previously N was at 4 and that was wrong, but position 2 is new)
   T at 3
   E at 4? Wait, we have two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's. We only know that E is present (at least one). 
   R at 5? But we know R is present and we are putting it at position 5? The feedback didn't say anything about position 5 for R? Actually, the feedback for R was only that it is not at position 2. So position 5 is allowed for R.

 However, we are using E at position 1 and 4? And we don't know if the word has two E's. We might get confusing feedback.

 Let me avoid duplicate letters for now to get clearer feedback.

 How about ""NEVER"": 
   N at 1 -> allowed? (previously was at 4, so position 1 is new)
   E at 2 -> allowed? (we don't know about position 2 for E? The feedback only said E is not at position 5. So position 2 is okay)
   V at 3
   E at 4 -> but we are using E twice? We don't know if the word has two E's.
   R at 5 -> allowed? (since R was forbidden at position 2, and position 5 is new)

 But we are repeating E. We might get feedback that E is at position 2? But we don't know if that's correct.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RINSE"" again? But we already have a second guess.

 Another idea: ""SENOR"": 
   S, E, N, O, R.
   Positions:
      S at 1
      E at 2 -> allowed? (E was at position 5 in the first guess and that was wrong, but position 2 is new and okay)
      N at 3 -> allowed? (N was at position 4, so position 3 is new)
      O at 4
      R at 5 -> allowed? (R was at position 2, so position 5 is new)

 This word uses the known letters (R, N, E) and tests S and O. Also, we avoid C and A.

 But note: we have R at position 5? The feedback didn't forbid R at position 5? Actually, the feedback only said R is not at position 2. So position 5 is free.

 However, we must be cautious: we know that E cannot be at position 5? But we are putting E at position 2? That's okay.

 But wait: what about the positions for R, N, E? We are putting:
   R at 5 -> but we don't know if that's the correct position? We are testing.
   N at 3 -> we don't know if that's the correct position? We are testing.

 This seems like a good candidate.

 But let me check: we have to avoid the letters C and A. ""SENOR"" doesn't have them.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROBES"": 
   R at 1 -> allowed? (R was at 2, so 1 is new)
   O at 2
   B at 3
   E at 4 -> allowed? (E was at 5, so 4 is new)
   S at 5

 This also uses R, N, E (but we are using N? Actually, we are not including N? Wait, we have R, E, and we are missing N? So we must include N.

 We must include R, N, E? Actually, we don't have to, but we know they are in the word. So we should include them to get positional information.

 Therefore, we must include R, N, E.

 So ""ROBES"" doesn't have N. So that's invalid.

 How about ""RINSE"": 
   R at 1 -> okay
   I at 2
   N at 3 -> okay (not position 4)
   S at 4
   E at 5 -> but we know E is not at position 5? So we cannot put E at 5.

 How about ""RENTS"": 
   R at 1 -> okay
   E at 2 -> okay
   N at 3 -> okay (not position 4)
   T at 4
   S at 5

 This seems okay.

 But note: we are putting E at position 2. We don't know if that's correct? We are testing.

 Alternatively, we can try ""NERDY"": 
   N at 1 -> allowed? (N was at 4, so 1 is new)
   E at 2 -> allowed? (E was at 5, so 2 is new)
   R at 3 -> allowed? (R was at 2, so 3 is new)
   D at 4
   Y at 5

 This also includes R, N, E.

 But we are using N at position 1, E at 2, R at 3. We haven't tested these positions.

 However, we must avoid the letters C and A. ""NERDY"" doesn't have them.

 But which one is better? ""SENOR"" and ""NERDY"" are both options.

 Let me consider the commonality of letters. We want to test common letters.

 Common consonants: T, S, R, N, D, L, etc.

 We already have R, N, E. We can try to test S and T? 

 ""SENOR"" has S and O. ""NERDY"" has D and Y.

 The letter T is very common. So maybe we should include T.

 How about ""TREND"": 
   T at 1
   R at 2 -> but wait, we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at position 2.

 How about ""TRIBE"": 
   T at 1
   R at 2 -> not allowed? Because we know R is not at position 2. So we must avoid R at position 2.

 How about ""STERN"": 
   S, T, E, R, N.
   Positions:
      S at 1
      T at 2
      E at 3 -> allowed? (E was at 5, so 3 is new)
      R at 4 -> allowed? (R was at 2, so 4 is new)
      N at 5 -> allowed? (N was at 4, so 5 is new)

 This seems good: 
   We are including R, N, E (each once? we hope)
   We are testing S and T.

 But note: we are putting N at position 5? The feedback didn't forbid N at position 5? Actually, the feedback only said N is not at position 4. So position 5 is allowed.

 Similarly, E at position 3? Allowed because we don't know about position 3 for E? Actually, we only know E is not at position 5. So position 3 is okay.

 R at position 4? Okay.

 So ""STERN"" is a good candidate.

 Another candidate: ""ROBED"": 
   R at 1 -> okay
   O at 2
   B at 3
   E at 4 -> okay (E was at 5, so 4 is new)
   D at 5

 But we are missing N? So we don't get information about N.

 We must include R, N, E. So ""STERN"" is better because it includes all three.

 Let me check if ""STERN"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

 So I choose ""STERN"".

 But note: we are using R, N, E, and we are testing S and T. Also, we are avoiding C and A.

 Therefore, our next guess: ""STERN""

 We'll get feedback on:
   S (at position 1): could be correct? or present? or absent?
   T (at position 2): same.
   E (at position 3): we know E is in the word, but is it at position 3?
   R (at position 4): is it at position 4?
   N (at position 5): is it at position 5?

 And we test S and T.

 This seems a good use of a guess.

 Alternatively, we could try ""RINSE"" (which we mentioned earlier) but we already have a second guess and we want to test more common letters.

 I think ""STERN"" is a good choice.

 So I'll go with ""STERN"".

<guess>stern</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **A** are absent (marked ""x""), so they can be excluded.
- **R**, **N**, and **E** are present (marked ""-"") but misplaced. Specifically:
  - R cannot be at position 2.
  - N cannot be at position 4.
  - E cannot be at position 5.

For the next guess:
- Must include **R**, **N**, and **E** (since they are confirmed present).
- Avoid **C** and **A**.
- Test new common letters (e.g., **S** and **T**) to gather more information.
- Prioritize placing R, N, E in new positions that fit the constraints (e.g., R not at position 2, N not at position 4, E not at position 5).

The word **""STERN""** fits perfectly:
- Includes R, N, E.
- Tests S and T (common letters).
- Avoids C and A.
- Positions: 
  - R is at position 4 (not 2).
  - N is at position 5 (not 4).
  - E is at position 3 (not 5).

This guess maximizes information by:
- Testing R, N, E in untried positions.
- Introducing two new common consonants (S and T).
- Avoiding forbidden letters (C and A).

So position 5 is allowed for R.\n\n However, we are using E at position 1 and 4? And we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. We might get confusing feedback.\n\n Let me avoid duplicate letters for now to get clearer feedback.\n\n How about ""NEVER"": \n   N at 1 -> allowed? (previously was at 4, so position 1 is new)\n   E at 2 -> allowed? (we don\'t know about position 2 for E? The feedback only said E is not at position 5. So position 2 is okay)\n   V at 3\n   E at 4 -> but we are using E twice? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s.\n   R at 5 -> allowed? (since R was forbidden at position 2, and position 5 is new)\n\n But we are repeating E. We might get feedback that E is at position 2?

Also, we avoid C and A.\n\n But note: we have R at position 5? The feedback didn\'t forbid R at position 5? Actually, the feedback only said R is not at position 2. So position 5 is free.\n\n However, we must be cautious: we know that E cannot be at position 5? But we are putting E at position 2? That\'s okay.\n\n But wait: what about the positions for R, N, E? We are putting:\n   R at 5 -> but we don\'t know if that\'s the correct position? We are testing.\n   N at 3 -> we don\'t know if that\'s the correct position? We are testing.\n\n This seems like a good candidate.\n\n But let me check: we have to avoid the letters C and A.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 2
  A: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, wrong position) -> so N is in the word, but not at position 4
  E: - (in word, wrong position) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 2: ""stern""
  S: ✓ (correct position) -> so the first letter is S
  T: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, wrong position) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 3 (and we already know not at position 5)
  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 4 (and we already know not at position 2)
  N: - (in word, wrong position) -> so N is in the word, but not at position 5 (and we already know not at position 4)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The first letter is S (from ""stern"" feedback: S is correct and in position 1).
2. The word contains R, N, E (from first guess) and we have tested E again in the second guess (but it's still present) and R and N are still present.
3. But note: the first guess had R at position 2 and that was wrong, and now in the second guess R was at position 4 and that was wrong. So R is not at position 2 or 4.
4. Similarly, N: in the first guess was at position 4 (wrong), in the second guess at position 5 (wrong). So N is not at position 4 or 5.
5. E: in the first guess at position 5 (wrong), in the second guess at position 3 (wrong). So E is not at position 3 or 5.

Also, we know the word does not contain:
- C (from first guess)
- A (from first guess)
- T (from second guess)

And we know the first letter is S.

So the word so far: S _ _ _ _

We need to place R, N, E in positions 2,3,4,5 but with constraints:
- R: cannot be at 2 or 4 -> so must be at 3 or 5? (since position 1 is taken by S, so only 2,3,4,5 available, but we have to avoid 2 and 4 for R? So R must be at 3 or 5? But wait, we also have to consider that in the first guess R was at 2 and that was wrong, and in the second guess R was at 4 and that was wrong. So R can be at 3 or 5? However, we don't know if the word has more than one R? But we don't have any indication of duplicates. So we assume one R for now.

Similarly for N: cannot be at 4 or 5 -> so must be at 2 or 3? (since position 1 is S and position 4 is not allowed for N? Actually, position 4 was tried for N in the first guess and was wrong, and in the second guess position 5 was tried and wrong. So N can be at 2 or 3? But we also have to avoid position 4? Actually, position 4 is still available? The feedback only said N is not at position 4 in the first guess, and not at position 5 in the second guess. So N can be at position 2 or 3.

For E: cannot be at position 3 or 5 -> so must be at 2 or 4? (positions 1,2,3,4,5). But position 1 is taken by S, so E can be at 2 or 4.

Now, we have to fill positions 2,3,4,5 with letters that include R, N, E and two new letters (which we haven't tested: so not C, A, T).

But note: we have three letters R, N, E to place, and two more letters to discover.

Also, we must avoid the letters that are absent: C, A, T.

Let's list the possible positions for R, N, E:

- R: can be at 3 or 5 (since 2 and 4 are forbidden by previous feedback)
- N: can be at 2 or 3 (since 4 and 5 are forbidden)
- E: can be at 2 or 4 (since 3 and 5 are forbidden)

But note: the positions must be distinct.

We also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we have no evidence so far.

Now, we need to choose a word that:
- Starts with S (since we know S is at position 1).
- Contains R, N, E (each at least once) and two new letters.
- The new letters must not be C, A, T.
- We must avoid putting R at position 2, N at position 4, E at position 3, or E at position 5.

We also want to test common letters.

Let's try to form a word that has S at position 1, and then the other letters.

We know R must be at 3 or 5, N at 2 or 3, E at 2 or 4.

But if we put N at 2, then E can be at 4? And R at 3 or 5.

Example: 
  Position 1: S
  Position 2: N (if we try that)
  Then position 3: could be R? But if R is at 3, that's allowed? But then we have to place E? And E can be at 4? 
  So: S N R E? But we need a fifth letter? Actually, we have four letters: S, N, R, E. But we need a fifth letter.

But we don't know the fifth letter. We have to test two more letters? Actually, we know the word has exactly R, N, E and two more? Or possibly more? But we don't know the total letter count.

We know the word has at least R, N, E. There might be duplicates? But we don't have any feedback indicating duplicates. So we assume no duplicates for now.

So the word is: S _ _ _ _ 
We have to fill the last four positions with R, N, E and two new letters? Actually, we have four positions (2,3,4,5) and we have three known letters (R, N, E) and two unknowns.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden positions for R, N, E.

So let's try:

Option 1: N at position 2? 
  Then we have: S N _ _ _
  Then R must be at 3 or 5? 
  And E must be at 4? (because if E is at 2, then we have to avoid position 5? But E can be at 4? Yes).

So possibility: S N E R ?  -> but we need a letter at position 5? And we have to avoid T? Also, we haven't tested many letters.

But we can try ""SNORE"": 
  S at 1 (correct? we don't know, but we have S at 1 already)
  N at 2 -> allowed? (we haven't tried N at 2? Yes, because we only tried N at 4 and 5)
  O at 3? 
  R at 4? -> but wait, we know R is not at position 4? From the second guess: R was at position 4 and we got a dash? Actually, in ""stern"", R was at position 4 and we got a dash meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. So R cannot be at position 4? So we cannot put R at 4.

How about ""SNORE"": 
  S at 1
  N at 2
  O at 3
  R at 4 -> not allowed! Because we know R is not at position 4.

So we cannot put R at 4.

Then what about putting R at 5? 
  So: S N _ _ R
  And E must be at 4? (because if we put E at 2, then we have to put E at 4? and then position 3 must be filled). 
  So: S N ? E R

Now, we have to fill position 3 and 4? And position 3 must be a new letter? And position 4 must be E? 

But we don't know if E can be at position 4? Yes, because we haven't tried E at 4? Actually, we tried E at position 3 (in ""stern"") and at position 5 (in ""crane"") and both were wrong. But position 4 is new.

So a candidate: ""SN?ER"" -> but we need a word: ""SNIDER""? But that's 6 letters. We need 5.

How about ""SNORE""? But we cannot put R at 4? We have R at 5? Then E at 4? But then we have: S N O R E -> but then R is at 4? That's forbidden.

We must avoid R at 4. So if we put R at 5, then we have: S N ? E R. And we cannot put E at 4? Because we are putting E at 4? Actually, we can put E at 4? But we haven't tried that.

But we also have to avoid N at 4? But in this structure, N is at 2, so that's okay.

So let's try ""SNORE"" but we cannot because R is at 4? Actually, in ""SNORE"": 
  Position 3: O, Position 4: R -> but R at 4 is forbidden.

How about ""SNEER"": 
  S at 1
  N at 2
  E at 3 -> but we know E cannot be at position 3? From the second guess: E was at position 3 and we got a dash? Actually, in ""stern"", E was at position 3 and we got a dash meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So E cannot be at position 3.

So we cannot put E at 3.

Then what? We can put E at 4? 

So: S N ? E R? But we have R at 5? Then we have: S N ? E R

We need a letter at position 3? And position 4? 

But we know R must be at 3 or 5? We are putting R at 5? So position 3 must be a new letter? And position 4 must be E? 

But then the word would be: S N (letter3) E R

What are some possibilities? 
  We need a word: S N ? E R -> examples: ""SNEER"" (but E at position 3? No, in ""SNEER"": 
      S at 1, N at 2, E at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but E at 3 is forbidden? So not allowed.

  ""SNIDER"": too long.

  ""SNAKE"": but A is absent? We cannot use A.

  ""SNORE"": but R at 4 is forbidden.

  ""SNIPE"": P is new? But we have E at 4? And R at 5? And N at 2? 
      S at 1, N at 2, I at 3, P at 4, E at 5? -> but E at 5 is forbidden? So not allowed.

  ""SNIDE"": 
      S at 1, N at 2, I at 3, D at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden.

  ""SNALE"": A absent? No.

  ""SNORE"": cannot because R at 4.

  ""SNITE"": T is absent? We cannot use T.

So it's hard to find a word with S at 1, N at 2, E at 4, and R at 5? And then a new letter at position 3? 

What about ""SNEER""? But that has E at position 3? Not allowed.

Alternatively, we can try putting N at position 3? 

Option 2: N at position 3? 
  Then we have: S _ N _ _
  Then R must be at 3 or 5? But position 3 is taken by N? So R must be at 5? Because R cannot be at 2 or 4? So only 3 and 5? But 3 is taken? So R at 5? 
  Then E must be at 2 or 4? But if we put E at 2? Then we have: S E N _ R? 
  And then position 4 must be a new letter? 

So: S E N ? R

We need a word: S E N ? R -> examples: ""SENOR"" (but we have O? and we haven't tested O? But we also have R at 5? And N at 3? 
But ""SENOR"": 
  S at 1, E at 2, N at 3, O at 4, R at 5 -> 
  Check positions: 
      R: at position 5 -> allowed? (since R forbidden at 2 and 4, so 5 is okay)
      N: at position 3 -> allowed? (N forbidden at 4 and 5, so 3 is okay)
      E: at position 2 -> allowed? (E forbidden at 3 and 5, so 2 is okay)

But we have to check if the letters are allowed: O is new? And we haven't tested O? So we can test it.

But note: we also have to avoid T? And we are not using T.

But wait: in the second guess we tested T and it was absent. So we cannot use T.

But ""SENOR"" doesn't have T? So it's okay.

But we have to consider: we are putting E at 2? We don't know if that's correct? We are testing.

But we also have to consider: what if R is at position 5? Then we have: S _ N _ R, and E must be at 2 or 4? 
  If E at 2: then we have: S E N ? R -> we need a letter at 4? And 4 must be E? But then we have two E's? 
  But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The feedback doesn't show duplicates? Actually, in Wordle, duplicates are allowed? But we don't have any indication. However, we can try.

But let's avoid duplicates for now? Because we don't know.

But ""SENOR"" uses O and N? And we haven't tested O? So we can test O.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden positions for R, N, E.

In ""SENOR"":
  Position 2: E -> allowed? (E forbidden at 3 and 5, so 2 is okay)
  Position 3: N -> allowed? (N forbidden at 4 and 5, so 3 is okay)
  Position 4: O -> new letter
  Position 5: R -> allowed? (R forbidden at 2 and 4, so 5 is okay)

So ""SENOR"" is a candidate.

But wait: we know from the first guess that R is in the word? And we are putting R at 5? That's okay.

But we also have to consider: what if the word has two R's? We don't know. But we are putting R at 5? And we haven't tested R at 5? So we can.

But let me see if there are other constraints.

We know that in the first guess, we had R at 2 (wrong) and in the second guess we had R at 4 (wrong). So R must be at 3 or 5? We are putting R at 5? That's one option.

Similarly, N: we tried at 4 (wrong) and 5 (wrong). So we are putting N at 3? That's allowed.

E: we tried at 5 (wrong) and 3 (wrong). So we are putting E at 2? That's allowed.

So ""SENOR"" is a valid candidate.

But we have to check if it meets the constraints.

Alternatively, we can try ""SERIF"": 
  S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, I at 4, F at 5.
  Check positions:
      R: at 3 -> allowed? (R forbidden at 2 and 4, so 3 is okay)
      E: at 2 -> allowed? (E forbidden at 3 and 5, so 2 is okay)
      N: but we are not including N? So we are missing N? We must include N because we know it's in the word.

We must include R, N, E. So ""SERIF"" doesn't have N? So invalid.

Another candidate: ""SINER"": 
  S at 1, I at 2, N at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
  Check positions:
      R: at 5 -> allowed? (R forbidden at 2 and 4, so 5 is okay)
      N: at 3 -> allowed? (N forbidden at 4 and 5, so 3 is okay)
      E: at 4 -> allowed? (E forbidden at 3 and 5, so 4 is okay)
  And we are testing I and ... (we have I and then E at 4? But we are testing I? And we are missing N? Wait, ""SINER"" has N? No: S-I-N-E-R? Wait, that's 5 letters: 
      S at 1, I at 2, N at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 
      But then we have N at 3? And E at 4? And R at 5? 
      But we are including N, E, R? 
      However, we have two vowels? And we are testing I? 

But we don't have any feedback about I? 

But we must avoid T? And I is not T? So it's okay.

But wait: we have to check if the positions for R, N, E are allowed? 
  R: at 5 -> allowed? (R forbidden at 2 and 4, so 5 is okay)
  N: at 3 -> allowed? (N forbidden at 4 and 5, so 3 is okay)
  E: at 4 -> allowed? (E forbidden at 3 and 5, so 4 is okay)

So ""SINER"" is a candidate? But we don't know if I and ... (the last letter) are in the word? We are testing.

But we also have to consider: what if the word has duplicate letters? We don't know.

But we can try.

But note: we have to avoid the letters C, A, T.

""SINER"" doesn't have C, A, T.

But we have two candidates: ""SENOR"" and ""SINER"". 

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters? 

Another candidate: ""SORE?"" -> but we need 5 letters: ""SORER""? Not a word.

""SOURS"": 
  S at 1, O at 2, U at 3, R at 4? -> but R at 4 is forbidden? So no.

""SNORE"": 
  S at 1, N at 2, O at 3, R at 4 -> but R at 4 is forbidden? So no.

""SNIDE"": 
  S at 1, N at 2, I at 3, D at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden? So no.

""SNIDE"" is invalid because of E at 5.

""SERIF"": missing N.

""SUPER"": 
  S at 1, U at 2, P at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> 
  R at 5: allowed? yes
  E at 4: allowed? yes (E forbidden at 3 and 5, so 4 is okay)
  N is missing? So we cannot use ""SUPER"" because we must have N.

We must include N.

So back to ""SENOR"" and ""SINER"". 

But we also have the constraint from the first guess: we had N at position 4 (wrong) and E at position 5 (wrong). But in ""SENOR"", we are putting N at 3? And E at 2? And R at 5? 

But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters? 

Another candidate: ""SNEER"" -> but E at position 3? Forbidden.

How about ""SNEAK"": A absent? No.

""SNITE"": T absent? No.

""SNOWY"": 
  S at 1, N at 2, O at 3, W at 4, Y at 5 -> but we are missing E? So we cannot.

We must have E.

So we have to include E.

So let's list words that start with S, have N, E, R and two other letters (not C, A, T), and satisfy the position constraints.

Possible words:

- ""SENOR"": S, E, N, O, R -> 
  Positions: 
      S at 1 (correct? we don't know, but we have S at 1)
      E at 2: allowed? (E forbidden at 3 and 5, so 2 is okay)
      N at 3: allowed? (N forbidden at 4 and 5, so 3 is okay)
      O at 4: new letter
      R at 5: allowed? (R forbidden at 2 and 4, so 5 is okay)

- ""SINER"": S, I, N, E, R -> 
  Positions:
      S at 1
      I at 2: new letter
      N at 3: allowed? (N forbidden at 4 and 5, so 3 is okay)
      E at 4: allowed? (E forbidden at 3 and 5, so 4 is okay)
      R at 5: allowed? (R forbidden at 2 and 4, so 5 is okay)

Both ""SENOR"" and ""SINER"" are valid? 

But we have to choose one. 

We also have to consider: in ""SENOR"", we are putting O at 4? And in ""SINER"", we are putting I at 2 and D at 4? 

We want to test common letters. O is more common than I? 

But we don't know. 

Another word: ""SERVE"": 
  S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, V at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden? So no.

""SERIF"": missing N.

""SUPER"": missing N.

""SNOUT"": missing E? No.

""SNORE"": R at 4? Forbidden.

So we are left with ""SENOR"" and ""SINER"".

But note: we have to avoid T? And we are not using T.

Which one to choose? 

We can also consider ""SINCE"": but C is absent? So no.

""MINCE"": but M at 1? We know M? But we haven't tested M? But we also have to start with S? So no.

We must start with S.

Another candidate: ""SHEER"": but H and E? And two E's? 
  S at 1, H at 2, E at 3 -> but E at 3 is forbidden? So no.

""SHIRE"": 
  S at 1, H at 2, I at 3, R at 4 -> but R at 4 is forbidden? So no.

""SNIDE"": E at 5? Forbidden.

So we have two strong candidates: ""SENOR"" and ""SINER"".

But let me check the dictionary? We must choose a valid word.

I think ""SENOR"" is more common? 

But we can also consider ""SERVE"" but E at 5? No.

How about ""SOURS"": but R at 4? Forbidden.

""SOBER"": 
  S at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> 
  R at 5: allowed? yes
  E at 4: allowed? yes (E forbidden at 3 and 5, so 4 is okay)
  N is missing? So we cannot use ""SOBER"" because we don't have N.

We must have N.

So we are stuck with ""SENOR"" and ""SINER"".

But note: we also have to consider the feedback from the first guess: we had R at position 2 (wrong) and N at position 4 (wrong). But in ""SENOR"", we are putting N at 3? That's a new position? And we are putting R at 5? 

But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters? 

Alternatively, we can try ""SNORE"" but R at 4? Forbidden.

Another idea: ""SNEER"" is invalid because of E at 3.

How about ""SNEAK"": A absent? No.

""SNITE"": T absent? No.

""SNOWY"": no E.

So I think ""SENOR"" and ""SINER"" are the main options.

But let me try to think of a word that has N at position 3? And E at position 2? And R at position 5? 

But we need a letter for position 4? 

Word: ""SENOR"" is one.

""SINER"" is the other.

But we also have ""SINCE"": C absent? No.

""MINER"": M at 1? We don't know M? But we can try? 
  But we must start with S? So ""MINER"" doesn't start with S? 

We must start with S.

Another word: ""SHIRE"": R at 4? Forbidden.

""SHINE"": 
  S at 1, H at 2, I at 3, N at 4? -> but N at 4 is forbidden? So no.

""SHONE"": 
  S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, N at 4? -> N at 4 is forbidden? So no.

""SHORE"": 
  S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, R at 4? -> R at 4 is forbidden? So no.

""SHIRE"": same issue.

So how about ""SNEER"": invalid because of E at 3.

Then we have ""SENOR"" and ""SINER"".

But we also have ""SIVER"": but V and R? And we have R at 5? But we are missing E? So no.

""SIXER"": not a word? 

I think we have to choose between ""SENOR"" and ""SINER"".

But note: in the first guess, we had E at position 5? And we know E is in the word? But we are putting E at position 2? That's okay.

But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters? 

We can also consider ""SERVE"": but E at 5? Forbidden.

""SERIF"": missing N.

So I think we have to pick one.

But let me check the feedback: we have to avoid putting R at 2, N at 4, E at 3, E at 5.

In ""SENOR"":
  Position 2: E -> allowed? yes
  Position 3: N -> allowed? yes (because N was at 4 and 5? We haven't tried N at 3? So okay)
  Position 4: O -> new
  Position 5: R -> allowed? yes (R forbidden at 2 and 4, so 5 is okay)

In ""SINER"":
  Position 2: I -> new
  Position 3: N -> allowed? (N forbidden at 4 and 5, so 3 is okay)
  Position 4: E -> allowed? (E forbidden at 3 and 5, so 4 is okay)
  Position 5: R -> allowed? (R forbidden at 2 and 4, so 5 is okay)

Both are valid.

But we have to choose one. 

We can also consider ""SINCE"": C absent? No.

""MINCE"": C absent? No.

""LINER"": but doesn't start with S? 

We must start with S.

Another word: ""SIVER"": doesn't have E? 

I think we have to choose ""SENOR"" because it uses O (a common vowel) and we haven't tested O? 

But we already know that the word has R, N, E? And we are including them? 

But we don't know if O is in the word? 

Alternatively, we can try to test more common consonants? 

But we have limited guesses. 

We can also consider: what if we put R at position 3? 

For example: S _ R _ _ 

But we have to put N and E? 

We can put N at 2? Then we have: S N R _ _ 

And E must be at 2 or 4? But position 2 is taken by N? So E must be at 4? 

Then we have: S N R E ? 

But we need a word: S N R E ? -> examples: ""SNORE"" (but R at 4? forbidden) -> no.

""SNIDE"": E at 5? forbidden.

""SNORE"": same issue.

""SONER"": not a word? 

""SONGY"": no E.

So it's hard.

Another possibility: put N at position 3? Then we have: S _ N _ _ 

And E must be at 2 or 4? 
  If E at 2: then we have: S E N _ _ 
  If E at 4: then we have: S _ N E _ 

But we then have to fill the blanks.

For example, S _ N E _ -> we need a letter at position 2 and 5? 

Word: ""SUNED"": but U and D? And we have E at 4? 
  S at 1, U at 2, N at 3? Wait, we are putting N at 3? Then E at 4? 
  But then we have: S U N E D -> but we have R? Where is R? We are not including R? So we must include R.

We must include R, N, E.

So in ""SUNED"", we have U, N, E, D? But no R? So no.

How about ""SUNER"": not a word? 

""SONER"": not a word.

""SUPER"": no N.

So it seems difficult to have N at 3 and E at 4? 

What about S _ N E R? That would be S? N? E? R? 

But we have to fill the middle? 

Word: ""SINER"" is actually S at 1, I at 2, N at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 
  So N at 3 and E at 4? 

But we don't know if that's correct? 

But we are testing.

Alternatively, we can try ""SOWER"": but no N? 

I think we have to choose between ""SENOR"" and ""SINER"".

But note: in the first guess, we had E at position 5? And we know E is in the word? But we are putting E at position 2? That's okay.

But we also have to consider: what if the word has E at position 2? We don't know.

We can also consider: we have to avoid the letters that are absent: C, A, T.

I think ""SENOR"" is a good choice.

But let me see: we have to test the positions for R, N, E.

In ""SENOR"":
  E is at 2 -> if it turns out to be correct? We'll know.
  N is at 3 -> if correct? We'll know.

But we are also testing O? 

Similarly, in ""SINER"", we are testing I and D.

But we don't know which is more common? 

We can also consider ""SERVE"": but E at 5? Forbidden.

""SERIF"": missing N.

Another word: ""SINCE"": C absent? No.

""MINCE"": C absent? No.

""LINER"": doesn't start with S? 

I think we have to go with ""SENOR"".

But wait: what if the word is ""SENOR""? Then we might get it? 

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can try to test more letters? 

But we have to include R, N, E.

So I think ""SENOR"" is a valid guess.

But let me double-check the constraints:

In ""SENOR"":
  Position 2: E -> allowed? yes (E forbidden at 3 and 5: 2 is okay)
  Position 3: N -> allowed? (N forbidden at 4 and 5: 3 is okay)
  Position 4: O -> new
  Position 5: R -> allowed? (R forbidden at 2 and 4: 5 is okay)

And we are testing O and the new position for R (5) and N (3).

But we are not testing any new letter? We are testing O and also confirming the positions of the known letters? 

But we already know the first letter is S? So we are testing the other positions.

But we have to make a guess.

Another candidate: ""SNEER"" is invalid.

""SNORE"": invalid.

""SNIDE"": E at 5? Forbidden.

So I think ""SENOR"" is a good choice.

But we have to consider: what if the word is ""SINER""? Then we might get more information? 

But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a different set of new letters? 

But we have to use two new letters? 

We have to choose two new letters? 

We can try ""SOWER"" but no N.

We must have R, N, E.

So I think ""SENOR"" is a valid word.

But let me check: is ""SENOR"" a valid English word? Yes.

So I'll go with ""SENOR"".

But wait: we have to avoid the letters that are absent: C, A, T. ""SENOR"" doesn't have them.

So guess: ""SENOR""

But note: we are putting E at position 2? We don't know if that's correct? We are testing.

But if we get feedback that E is at position 2? Then we know? Or if not, then we know it's not at 2.

Similarly for the others.

So let's go with ""SENOR"".

<guess>senor </guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  
  - **C** and **A** are absent (x) → exclude them.  
  - **R**, **N**, **E** are present (-) but misplaced:  
    - R ≠ position 2  
    - N ≠ position 4  
    - E ≠ position 5  

- **Guess 2 (""stern"")**:  
  - **S** is correct and in position 1 (✓) → first letter is **S**.  
  - **T** is absent (x) → exclude it.  
  - **E** is present but not at position 3 (dash) → E ≠ position 3.  
  - **R** is present but not at position 4 (dash) → R ≠ position 4.  
  - **N** is present but not at position 5 (dash) → N ≠ position 5.  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters**: **S** (position 1), **R**, **N**, **E** (present, but positions unknown).  
- **Excluded letters**: **C**, **A**, **T**.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - R: Cannot be at position 2 or 4 → must be at 3 or 5.  
  - N: Cannot be at position 4 or 5 → must be at 2 or 3.  
  - E: Cannot be at position 3 or 5 → must be at 2 or 4.  
- **Unknowns**: Two letters remain (besides S, R, N, E).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Must start with **S**.  
- Must include **R**, **N**, **E** (each at least once) in positions that satisfy the constraints.  
- Test new common letters (e.g., **O**, **I**, **D**, **L**) to maximize information.  
- Avoid excluded letters (C, A, T).  

### Why ""SENOR""?
- **S** at position 1 (known correct).  
- **E** at position 2: Tests if E is at the beginning.  
- **N** at position 3: Tests if N is at position 3.  
- **O** (new letter) at position 4: Tests a common vowel.  
- **R** at position 5: Tests R at the end (allowed, since R forbidden at positions 2/4).  

This guess efficiently tests the known letters in new positions while introducing **O** (a common untested letter). 

<guess>senor </guess>",senor,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 2
  A: x (not in word)
  N: - (in word, wrong position) -> so N is in the word, but not at position 4
  E: - (in word, wrong position) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 2: ""stern""
  S: ✓ (correct position) -> so the first letter is S
  T: x (not in word)
  E: - (in word, wrong position) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 3 (and we already know not at position 5)
  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word, but not at position 4 (and we already know not at position 2)
  N: - (in word, wrong position) -> so N is in the word, but not at position 5 (and we already know not at position 4)

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The first letter is S (from ""stern"" feedback: S is correct and in position 1).
2. The word contains R, N, E (from first guess) and we have tested E again in the second guess (but it's still present) and R and N are still present.
3. But note: the first guess had R at position 2 and that was wrong, and now in the second guess R was at position 4 and that was wrong. So R is not at position 2 or 4.
4. Similarly, N: in the first guess was at position 4 (wrong), in the second guess at position 5 (wrong). So N is not at position 4 or 5.
5. E: in the first guess at position 5 (wrong), in the second guess at position 3 (wrong). So E is not at position 3 or 5.

Also, we know the word does not contain:
- C (from first guess)
- A (from first guess)
- T (from second guess)

And we know the first letter is S.

So the word so far: S _ _ _ _

We need to place R, N, E in positions 2,3,4,5 but with constraints:
- R: cannot be at 2 or 4 -> so must be at 3 or 5? (since position 1 is taken by S, so only 2,3,4,5 available, but we have to avoid 2 and 4 for R? So R must be at 3 or 5? But wait, we also have to consider that in the first guess R was at 2 and that was wrong, and in the second guess R was at 4 and that was wrong. So R can be at 3 or 5? However, we don't know if the word has more than one R? But we don't have any indication of duplicates. So we assume one R for now.

Similarly for N: cannot be at 4 or 5 -> so must be at 2 or 3? (since position 1 is S and position 4 is not allowed for N? Actually, position 4 was tried for N in the first guess and was wrong, and in the second guess position 5 was tried and wrong. So N can be at 2 or 3? But we also have to avoid position 4? Actually, position 4 is still available? The feedback only said N is not at position 4 in the first guess, and not at position 5 in the second guess. So N can be at position 2 or 3.

For E: cannot be at position 3 or 5 -> so must be at 2 or 4? (positions 1,2,3,4,5). But position 1 is taken by S, so E can be at 2 or 4.

Now, we have to fill positions 2,3,4,5 with letters that include R, N, E and two new letters (which we haven't tested: so not C, A, T).

But note: we have three letters R, N, E to place, and two more letters to discover.

Also, we must avoid the letters that are absent: C, A, T.

Let's list the possible positions for R, N, E:

- R: can be at 3 or 5 (since 2 and 4 are forbidden by previous feedback)
- N: can be at 2 or 3 (since 4 and 5 are forbidden)
- E: can be at 2 or 4 (since 3 and 5 are forbidden)

But note: the positions must be distinct.

We also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we have no evidence so far.

Now, we need to choose a word that:
- Starts with S (since we know S is at position 1).
- Contains R, N, E (each at least once) and two new letters.
- The new letters must not be C, A, T.
- We must avoid putting R at position 2, N at position 4, E at position 3, or E at position 5.

We also want to test common letters.

Let's try to form a word that has S at position 1, and then the other letters.

We know R must be at 3 or 5, N at 2 or 3, E at 2 or 4.

But if we put N at 2, then E can be at 4? And R at 3 or 5.

Example: 
  Position 1: S
  Position 2: N (if we try that)
  Then position 3: could be R? But if R is at 3, that's allowed? But then we have to place E? And E can be at 4? 
  So: S N R E? But we need a fifth letter? Actually, we have four letters: S, N, R, E. But we need a fifth letter.

But we don't know the fifth letter. We have to test two more letters? Actually, we know the word has exactly R, N, E and two more? Or possibly more? But we don't know the total letter count.

We know the word has at least R, N, E. There might be duplicates? But we don't have any feedback indicating duplicates. So we assume no duplicates for now.

So the word is: S _ _ _ _ 
We have to fill the last four positions with R, N, E and two new letters? Actually, we have four positions (2,3,4,5) and we have three known letters (R, N, E) and two unknowns.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden positions for R, N, E.

So let's try:

Option 1: N at position 2? 
  Then we have: S N _ _ _
  Then R must be at 3 or 5? 
  And E must be at 4? (because if E is at 2, then we have to avoid position 5? But E can be at 4? Yes).

So possibility: S N E R ?  -> but we need a letter at position 5? And we have to avoid T? Also, we haven't tested many letters.

But we can try ""SNORE"": 
  S at 1 (correct? we don't know, but we have S at 1 already)
  N at 2 -> allowed? (we haven't tried N at 2? Yes, because we only tried N at 4 and 5)
  O at 3? 
  R at 4? -> but wait, we know R is not at position 4? From the second guess: R was at position 4 and we got a dash? Actually, in ""stern"", R was at position 4 and we got a dash meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. So R cannot be at position 4? So we cannot put R at 4.

How about ""SNORE"": 
  S at 1
  N at 2
  O at 3
  R at 4 -> not allowed! Because we know R is not at position 4.

So we cannot put R at 4.

Then what about putting R at 5? 
  So: S N _ _ R
  And E must be at 4? (because if we put E at 2, then we have to put E at 4? and then position 3 must be filled). 
  So: S N ? E R

Now, we have to fill position 3 and 4? And position 3 must be a new letter? And position 4 must be E? 

But we don't know if E can be at position 4? Yes, because we haven't tried E at 4? Actually, we tried E at position 3 (in ""stern"") and at position 5 (in ""crane"") and both were wrong. But position 4 is new.

So a candidate: ""SN?ER"" -> but we need a word: ""SNIDER""? But that's 6 letters. We need 5.

How about ""SNORE""? But we cannot put R at 4? We have R at 5? Then E at 4? But then we have: S N O R E -> but then R is at 4? That's forbidden.

We must avoid R at 4. So if we put R at 5, then we have: S N ? E R. And we cannot put E at 4? Because we are putting E at 4? Actually, we can put E at 4? But we haven't tried that.

But we also have to avoid N at 4? But in this structure, N is at 2, so that's okay.

So let's try ""SNORE"" but we cannot because R is at 4? Actually, in ""SNORE"": 
  Position 3: O, Position 4: R -> but R at 4 is forbidden.

How about ""SNEER"": 
  S at 1
  N at 2
  E at 3 -> but we know E cannot be at position 3? From the second guess: E was at position 3 and we got a dash? Actually, in ""stern"", E was at position 3 and we got a dash meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So E cannot be at position 3.

So we cannot put E at 3.

Then what? We can put E at 4? 

So: S N ? E R? But we have R at 5? Then we have: S N ? E R

We need a letter at position 3? And position 4? 

But we know R must be at 3 or 5? We are putting R at 5? So position 3 must be a new letter? And position 4 must be E? 

But then the word would be: S N (letter3) E R

What are some possibilities? 
  We need a word: S N ? E R -> examples: ""SNEER"" (but E at position 3? No, in ""SNEER"": 
      S at 1, N at 2, E at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> but E at 3 is forbidden? So not allowed.

  ""SNIDER"": too long.

  ""SNAKE"": but A is absent? We cannot use A.

  ""SNORE"": but R at 4 is forbidden.

  ""SNIPE"": P is new? But we have E at 4? And R at 5? And N at 2? 
      S at 1, N at 2, I at 3, P at 4, E at 5? -> but E at 5 is forbidden? So not allowed.

  ""SNIDE"": 
      S at 1, N at 2, I at 3, D at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden.

  ""SNALE"": A absent? No.

  ""SNORE"": cannot because R at 4.

  ""SNITE"": T is absent? We cannot use T.

So it's hard to find a word with S at 1, N at 2, E at 4, and R at 5? And then a new letter at position 3? 

What about ""SNEER""? But that has E at position 3? Not allowed.

Alternatively, we can try putting N at position 3? 

Option 2: N at position 3? 
  Then we have: S _ N _ _
  Then R must be at 3 or 5? But position 3 is taken by N? So R must be at 5? Because R cannot be at 2 or 4? So only 3 and 5? But 3 is taken? So R at 5? 
  Then E must be at 2 or 4? But if we put E at 2? Then we have: S E N _ R? 
  And then position 4 must be a new letter? 

So: S E N ? R

We need a word: S E N ? R -> examples: ""SENOR"" (but we have O? and we haven't tested O? But we also have R at 5? And N at 3? 
But ""SENOR"": 
  S at 1, E at 2, N at 3, O at 4, R at 5 -> 
  Check positions: 
      R: at position 5 -> allowed? (since R forbidden at 2 and 4, so 5 is okay)
      N: at position 3 -> allowed? (N forbidden at 4 and 5, so 3 is okay)
      E: at position 2 -> allowed? (E forbidden at 3 and 5, so 2 is okay)

But we have to check if the letters are allowed: O is new? And we haven't tested O? So we can test it.

But note: we also have to avoid T? And we are not using T.

But wait: in the second guess we tested T and it was absent. So we cannot use T.

But ""SENOR"" doesn't have T? So it's okay.

But we have to consider: we are putting E at 2? We don't know if that's correct? We are testing.

But we also have to consider: what if R is at position 5? Then we have: S _ N _ R, and E must be at 2 or 4? 
  If E at 2: then we have: S E N ? R -> we need a letter at 4? And 4 must be E? But then we have two E's? 
  But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The feedback doesn't show duplicates? Actually, in Wordle, duplicates are allowed? But we don't have any indication. However, we can try.

But let's avoid duplicates for now? Because we don't know.

But ""SENOR"" uses O and N? And we haven't tested O? So we can test O.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden positions for R, N, E.

In ""SENOR"":
  Position 2: E -> allowed? (E forbidden at 3 and 5, so 2 is okay)
  Position 3: N -> allowed? (N forbidden at 4 and 5, so 3 is okay)
  Position 4: O -> new letter
  Position 5: R -> allowed? (R forbidden at 2 and 4, so 5 is okay)

So ""SENOR"" is a candidate.

But wait: we know from the first guess that R is in the word? And we are putting R at 5? That's okay.

But we also have to consider: what if the word has two R's? We don't know. But we are putting R at 5? And we haven't tested R at 5? So we can.

But let me see if there are other constraints.

We know that in the first guess, we had R at 2 (wrong) and in the second guess we had R at 4 (wrong). So R must be at 3 or 5? We are putting R at 5? That's one option.

Similarly, N: we tried at 4 (wrong) and 5 (wrong). So we are putting N at 3? That's allowed.

E: we tried at 5 (wrong) and 3 (wrong). So we are putting E at 2? That's allowed.

So ""SENOR"" is a valid candidate.

But we have to check if it meets the constraints.

Alternatively, we can try ""SERIF"": 
  S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, I at 4, F at 5.
  Check positions:
      R: at 3 -> allowed? (R forbidden at 2 and 4, so 3 is okay)
      E: at 2 -> allowed? (E forbidden at 3 and 5, so 2 is okay)
      N: but we are not including N? So we are missing N? We must include N because we know it's in the word.

We must include R, N, E. So ""SERIF"" doesn't have N? So invalid.

Another candidate: ""SINER"": 
  S at 1, I at 2, N at 3, E at 4, R at 5.
  Check positions:
      R: at 5 -> allowed? (R forbidden at 2 and 4, so 5 is okay)
      N: at 3 -> allowed? (N forbidden at 4 and 5, so 3 is okay)
      E: at 4 -> allowed? (E forbidden at 3 and 5, so 4 is okay)
  And we are testing I and ... (we have I and then E at 4? But we are testing I? And we are missing N? Wait, ""SINER"" has N? No: S-I-N-E-R? Wait, that's 5 letters: 
      S at 1, I at 2, N at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 
      But then we have N at 3? And E at 4? And R at 5? 
      But we are including N, E, R? 
      However, we have two vowels? And we are testing I? 

But we don't have any feedback about I? 

But we must avoid T? And I is not T? So it's okay.

But wait: we have to check if the positions for R, N, E are allowed? 
  R: at 5 -> allowed? (R forbidden at 2 and 4, so 5 is okay)
  N: at 3 -> allowed? (N forbidden at 4 and 5, so 3 is okay)
  E: at 4 -> allowed? (E forbidden at 3 and 5, so 4 is okay)

So ""SINER"" is a candidate? But we don't know if I and ... (the last letter) are in the word? We are testing.

But we also have to consider: what if the word has duplicate letters? We don't know.

But we can try.

But note: we have to avoid the letters C, A, T.

""SINER"" doesn't have C, A, T.

But we have two candidates: ""SENOR"" and ""SINER"". 

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters? 

Another candidate: ""SORE?"" -> but we need 5 letters: ""SORER""? Not a word.

""SOURS"": 
  S at 1, O at 2, U at 3, R at 4? -> but R at 4 is forbidden? So no.

""SNORE"": 
  S at 1, N at 2, O at 3, R at 4 -> but R at 4 is forbidden? So no.

""SNIDE"": 
  S at 1, N at 2, I at 3, D at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden? So no.

""SNIDE"" is invalid because of E at 5.

""SERIF"": missing N.

""SUPER"": 
  S at 1, U at 2, P at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> 
  R at 5: allowed? yes
  E at 4: allowed? yes (E forbidden at 3 and 5, so 4 is okay)
  N is missing? So we cannot use ""SUPER"" because we must have N.

We must include N.

So back to ""SENOR"" and ""SINER"". 

But we also have the constraint from the first guess: we had N at position 4 (wrong) and E at position 5 (wrong). But in ""SENOR"", we are putting N at 3? And E at 2? And R at 5? 

But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters? 

Another candidate: ""SNEER"" -> but E at position 3? Forbidden.

How about ""SNEAK"": A absent? No.

""SNITE"": T absent? No.

""SNOWY"": 
  S at 1, N at 2, O at 3, W at 4, Y at 5 -> but we are missing E? So we cannot.

We must have E.

So we have to include E.

So let's list words that start with S, have N, E, R and two other letters (not C, A, T), and satisfy the position constraints.

Possible words:

- ""SENOR"": S, E, N, O, R -> 
  Positions: 
      S at 1 (correct? we don't know, but we have S at 1)
      E at 2: allowed? (E forbidden at 3 and 5, so 2 is okay)
      N at 3: allowed? (N forbidden at 4 and 5, so 3 is okay)
      O at 4: new letter
      R at 5: allowed? (R forbidden at 2 and 4, so 5 is okay)

- ""SINER"": S, I, N, E, R -> 
  Positions:
      S at 1
      I at 2: new letter
      N at 3: allowed? (N forbidden at 4 and 5, so 3 is okay)
      E at 4: allowed? (E forbidden at 3 and 5, so 4 is okay)
      R at 5: allowed? (R forbidden at 2 and 4, so 5 is okay)

Both ""SENOR"" and ""SINER"" are valid? 

But we have to choose one. 

We also have to consider: in ""SENOR"", we are putting O at 4? And in ""SINER"", we are putting I at 2 and D at 4? 

We want to test common letters. O is more common than I? 

But we don't know. 

Another word: ""SERVE"": 
  S at 1, E at 2, R at 3, V at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is forbidden? So no.

""SERIF"": missing N.

""SUPER"": missing N.

""SNOUT"": missing E? No.

""SNORE"": R at 4? Forbidden.

So we are left with ""SENOR"" and ""SINER"".

But note: we have to avoid T? And we are not using T.

Which one to choose? 

We can also consider ""SINCE"": but C is absent? So no.

""MINCE"": but M at 1? We know M? But we haven't tested M? But we also have to start with S? So no.

We must start with S.

Another candidate: ""SHEER"": but H and E? And two E's? 
  S at 1, H at 2, E at 3 -> but E at 3 is forbidden? So no.

""SHIRE"": 
  S at 1, H at 2, I at 3, R at 4 -> but R at 4 is forbidden? So no.

""SNIDE"": E at 5? Forbidden.

So we have two strong candidates: ""SENOR"" and ""SINER"".

But let me check the dictionary? We must choose a valid word.

I think ""SENOR"" is more common? 

But we can also consider ""SERVE"" but E at 5? No.

How about ""SOURS"": but R at 4? Forbidden.

""SOBER"": 
  S at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> 
  R at 5: allowed? yes
  E at 4: allowed? yes (E forbidden at 3 and 5, so 4 is okay)
  N is missing? So we cannot use ""SOBER"" because we don't have N.

We must have N.

So we are stuck with ""SENOR"" and ""SINER"".

But note: we also have to consider the feedback from the first guess: we had R at position 2 (wrong) and N at position 4 (wrong). But in ""SENOR"", we are putting N at 3? That's a new position? And we are putting R at 5? 

But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters? 

Alternatively, we can try ""SNORE"" but R at 4? Forbidden.

Another idea: ""SNEER"" is invalid because of E at 3.

How about ""SNEAK"": A absent? No.

""SNITE"": T absent? No.

""SNOWY"": no E.

So I think ""SENOR"" and ""SINER"" are the main options.

But let me try to think of a word that has N at position 3? And E at position 2? And R at position 5? 

But we need a letter for position 4? 

Word: ""SENOR"" is one.

""SINER"" is the other.

But we also have ""SINCE"": C absent? No.

""MINER"": M at 1? We don't know M? But we can try? 
  But we must start with S? So ""MINER"" doesn't start with S? 

We must start with S.

Another word: ""SHIRE"": R at 4? Forbidden.

""SHINE"": 
  S at 1, H at 2, I at 3, N at 4? -> but N at 4 is forbidden? So no.

""SHONE"": 
  S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, N at 4? -> N at 4 is forbidden? So no.

""SHORE"": 
  S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, R at 4? -> R at 4 is forbidden? So no.

""SHIRE"": same issue.

So how about ""SNEER"": invalid because of E at 3.

Then we have ""SENOR"" and ""SINER"".

But we also have ""SIVER"": but V and R? And we have R at 5? But we are missing E? So no.

""SIXER"": not a word? 

I think we have to choose between ""SENOR"" and ""SINER"".

But note: in the first guess, we had E at position 5? And we know E is in the word? But we are putting E at position 2? That's okay.

But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters? 

We can also consider ""SERVE"": but E at 5? Forbidden.

""SERIF"": missing N.

So I think we have to pick one.

But let me check the feedback: we have to avoid putting R at 2, N at 4, E at 3, E at 5.

In ""SENOR"":
  Position 2: E -> allowed? yes
  Position 3: N -> allowed? yes (because N was at 4 and 5? We haven't tried N at 3? So okay)
  Position 4: O -> new
  Position 5: R -> allowed? yes (R forbidden at 2 and 4, so 5 is okay)

In ""SINER"":
  Position 2: I -> new
  Position 3: N -> allowed? (N forbidden at 4 and 5, so 3 is okay)
  Position 4: E -> allowed? (E forbidden at 3 and 5, so 4 is okay)
  Position 5: R -> allowed? (R forbidden at 2 and 4, so 5 is okay)

Both are valid.

But we have to choose one. 

We can also consider ""SINCE"": C absent? No.

""MINCE"": C absent? No.

""LINER"": but doesn't start with S? 

We must start with S.

Another word: ""SIVER"": doesn't have E? 

I think we have to choose ""SENOR"" because it uses O (a common vowel) and we haven't tested O? 

But we already know that the word has R, N, E? And we are including them? 

But we don't know if O is in the word? 

Alternatively, we can try to test more common consonants? 

But we have limited guesses. 

We can also consider: what if we put R at position 3? 

For example: S _ R _ _ 

But we have to put N and E? 

We can put N at 2? Then we have: S N R _ _ 

And E must be at 2 or 4? But position 2 is taken by N? So E must be at 4? 

Then we have: S N R E ? 

But we need a word: S N R E ? -> examples: ""SNORE"" (but R at 4? forbidden) -> no.

""SNIDE"": E at 5? forbidden.

""SNORE"": same issue.

""SONER"": not a word? 

""SONGY"": no E.

So it's hard.

Another possibility: put N at position 3? Then we have: S _ N _ _ 

And E must be at 2 or 4? 
  If E at 2: then we have: S E N _ _ 
  If E at 4: then we have: S _ N E _ 

But we then have to fill the blanks.

For example, S _ N E _ -> we need a letter at position 2 and 5? 

Word: ""SUNED"": but U and D? And we have E at 4? 
  S at 1, U at 2, N at 3? Wait, we are putting N at 3? Then E at 4? 
  But then we have: S U N E D -> but we have R? Where is R? We are not including R? So we must include R.

We must include R, N, E.

So in ""SUNED"", we have U, N, E, D? But no R? So no.

How about ""SUNER"": not a word? 

""SONER"": not a word.

""SUPER"": no N.

So it seems difficult to have N at 3 and E at 4? 

What about S _ N E R? That would be S? N? E? R? 

But we have to fill the middle? 

Word: ""SINER"" is actually S at 1, I at 2, N at 3, E at 4, R at 5? 
  So N at 3 and E at 4? 

But we don't know if that's correct? 

But we are testing.

Alternatively, we can try ""SOWER"": but no N? 

I think we have to choose between ""SENOR"" and ""SINER"".

But note: in the first guess, we had E at position 5? And we know E is in the word? But we are putting E at position 2? That's okay.

But we also have to consider: what if the word has E at position 2? We don't know.

We can also consider: we have to avoid the letters that are absent: C, A, T.

I think ""SENOR"" is a good choice.

But let me see: we have to test the positions for R, N, E.

In ""SENOR"":
  E is at 2 -> if it turns out to be correct? We'll know.
  N is at 3 -> if correct? We'll know.

But we are also testing O? 

Similarly, in ""SINER"", we are testing I and D.

But we don't know which is more common? 

We can also consider ""SERVE"": but E at 5? Forbidden.

""SERIF"": missing N.

Another word: ""SINCE"": C absent? No.

""MINCE"": C absent? No.

""LINER"": doesn't start with S? 

I think we have to go with ""SENOR"".

But wait: what if the word is ""SENOR""? Then we might get it? 

But we have to make a guess.

Alternatively, we can try to test more letters? 

But we have to include R, N, E.

So I think ""SENOR"" is a valid guess.

But let me double-check the constraints:

In ""SENOR"":
  Position 2: E -> allowed? yes (E forbidden at 3 and 5: 2 is okay)
  Position 3: N -> allowed? (N forbidden at 4 and 5: 3 is okay)
  Position 4: O -> new
  Position 5: R -> allowed? (R forbidden at 2 and 4: 5 is okay)

And we are testing O and the new position for R (5) and N (3).

But we are not testing any new letter? We are testing O and also confirming the positions of the known letters? 

But we already know the first letter is S? So we are testing the other positions.

But we have to make a guess.

Another candidate: ""SNEER"" is invalid.

""SNORE"": invalid.

""SNIDE"": E at 5? Forbidden.

So I think ""SENOR"" is a good choice.

But we have to consider: what if the word is ""SINER""? Then we might get more information? 

But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a different set of new letters? 

But we have to use two new letters? 

We have to choose two new letters? 

We can try ""SOWER"" but no N.

We must have R, N, E.

So I think ""SENOR"" is a valid word.

But let me check: is ""SENOR"" a valid English word? Yes.

So I'll go with ""SENOR"".

But wait: we have to avoid the letters that are absent: C, A, T. ""SENOR"" doesn't have them.

So guess: ""SENOR""

But note: we are putting E at position 2? We don't know if that's correct? We are testing.

But if we get feedback that E is at position 2? Then we know? Or if not, then we know it's not at 2.

Similarly for the others.

So let's go with ""SENOR"".

<guess>senor </guess>After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**:  
  - **C** and **A** are absent (x) → exclude them.  
  - **R**, **N**, **E** are present (-) but misplaced:  
    - R ≠ position 2  
    - N ≠ position 4  
    - E ≠ position 5  

- **Guess 2 (""stern"")**:  
  - **S** is correct and in position 1 (✓) → first letter is **S**.  
  - **T** is absent (x) → exclude it.  
  - **E** is present but not at position 3 (dash) → E ≠ position 3.  
  - **R** is present but not at position 4 (dash) → R ≠ position 4.  
  - **N** is present but not at position 5 (dash) → N ≠ position 5.  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters**: **S** (position 1), **R**, **N**, **E** (present, but positions unknown).  
- **Excluded letters**: **C**, **A**, **T**.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - R: Cannot be at position 2 or 4 → must be at 3 or 5.  
  - N: Cannot be at position 4 or 5 → must be at 2 or 3.  
  - E: Cannot be at position 3 or 5 → must be at 2 or 4.  
- **Unknowns**: Two letters remain (besides S, R, N, E).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Must start with **S**.  
- Must include **R**, **N**, **E** (each at least once) in positions that satisfy the constraints.  
- Test new common letters (e.g., **O**, **I**, **D**, **L**) to maximize information.  
- Avoid excluded letters (C, A, T).  

### Why ""SENOR""?
- **S** at position 1 (known correct).  
- **E** at position 2: Tests if E is at the beginning.  
- **N** at position 3: Tests if N is at position 3.  
- **O** (new letter) at position 4: Tests a common vowel.  
- **R** at position 5: Tests R at the end (allowed, since R forbidden at positions 2/4).  

This guess efficiently tests the known letters in new positions while introducing **O** (a common untested letter).",Guess 3: senor -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) E(✓) N(✓) O(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
