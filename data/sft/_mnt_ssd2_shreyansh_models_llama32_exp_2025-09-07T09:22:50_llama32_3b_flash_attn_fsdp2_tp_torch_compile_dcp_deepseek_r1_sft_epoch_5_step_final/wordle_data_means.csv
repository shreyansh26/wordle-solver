We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 3rd letter)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the 4th letter)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The secret word has A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position. So the word pattern is: _ _ A N _
- The letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position (since it was in the 5th position in ""crane"" and got a '-', meaning it's present but misplaced). Also, note that E cannot be in the 3rd or 4th because those are fixed as A and N, and we know E is not in the 5th. So E must be in either the 1st or 2nd position.
- The letters C and R are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position.
- Includes the letter E, but not in the 5th position (and not in the 3rd or 4th, so only 1st or 2nd).
- Does not contain C or R.

Additionally, we should try to include other common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for E: 1st or 2nd.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ _ A N _ and contain E.

We can also consider that we have two unknown positions (1st and 2nd) and one unknown last position (5th). But note, we have to place E in one of the first two positions.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

We should avoid using C and R.

Let me try to list some words that fit the pattern:

- The word must have A in 3rd and N in 4th.

Examples:
- ""PLANE"": P L A N E -> but E is in the 5th, which we know is not allowed because the feedback for E was '-' meaning it's present but not in the 5th. Also, in ""crane"", E was in the 5th and we got '-', so E cannot be in 5th. Therefore, ""PLANE"" would put E in 5th again, which is invalid. So we avoid that.

We need a word with E in either 1st or 2nd.

Let me think of words with A in 3rd and N in 4th, and E in 1st or 2nd.

With E in 1st:
- ""E _ A N _"" -> e.g., ""ELAND"" (but L is unknown, and D is unknown). Also, we don't know if L or D are in the word.

But note: we have to avoid C and R.

""ELAND"": E L A N D -> pattern: E L A N D -> positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:D. This fits the pattern. And E is in 1st, which is allowed.

But we don't know if L and D are in the word. We can use this to test.

With E in 2nd:
- ""_ E A N _"" -> e.g., ""LEANT"" (but we know A is in 3rd, so this would be L E A N T -> 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T). This also fits. And E is in 2nd.

We also have to consider that the feedback for E was '-' meaning it's in the word but not in the 5th. Both ""ELAND"" and ""LEANT"" have E in 1st or 2nd, so that's okay.

But note: we have two unknown positions. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

We also know that the word does not contain C or R.

Let me check common words:

- ""LEANT"": meaning to lean or become lean. It's a valid word.
- ""ELAND"": a type of antelope. Valid.

But we might also consider other words.

Another possibility: ""DEIGN"" -> D E I G N -> but the pattern requires A in 3rd and N in 4th. In ""DEIGN"", the A is in 3rd and N in 5th? Wait, no: D(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). So it doesn't have A in 3rd. So invalid.

We must have A in 3rd and N in 4th.

Another word: ""MEANT"" -> M E A N T -> 1:M, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T. This fits. And E is in 2nd.

But we don't know if M and T are in the word.

Similarly, ""BEANT"" is not a word. ""YEANT"" is not common. ""HEANT"" not a word.

""MEANT"" is a word (meaning: to make mean or sullen).

But let's see: we have two candidates: ""ELAND"" and ""MEANT"".

We could also consider ""PAINT"": P A I N T -> but the pattern requires A in 3rd? In ""PAINT"": P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). So A is in 2nd, not 3rd. So invalid.

Another one: ""SAINT"" -> S A I N T -> A is in 2nd, not 3rd.

We need A in 3rd and N in 4th.

Another word: ""BLAND"" -> B L A N D -> 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:D. This fits. And E is not in this word? But we know E must be in the word because of the feedback. So we must include E.

We must include E because it is present.

So, ""BLAND"" does not have E, so it's invalid.

Similarly, ""PLANT"" has E in 5th, which is not allowed.

So, let's stick with words that have E and fit the pattern.

Words with E in 1st: ""ELAND"", ""EXAM"" (but ""EXAM"" has A in 3rd? E X A M -> 1:E, 2:X, 3:A, 4:M -> but we need N in 4th, not M. So ""EXAM"" doesn't have N in 4th.

We need the 4th to be N.

So, with E in 1st: 
- ""ELAND"": E L A N D -> 1:E, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:D
- ""EASTS"" is 5 letters? But ""EASTS"" has two S's and the pattern: E A S T S -> no, because A is in 2nd, not 3rd.

Another one: ""EATEN"" -> E A T E N -> A is in 2nd, not 3rd.

We need the third letter to be A.

So, ""ELAND"" and ""MEANT"" are candidates.

With E in 2nd:
- ""LEANT"": L E A N T -> 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T
- ""MEANT"": M E A N T -> same as above, but with M instead of L.
- ""WEANS"" is 4 letters. ""WEANT"" not a word.
- ""HEANS"" not a word.

Also, ""DEANS"" -> D E A N S -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:S. This fits. And E is in 2nd.

But we don't know if D and S are in the word.

Similarly, ""MEANS"" -> M E A N S -> same.

Now, we have:
- ""ELAND"": E in 1st, L and D unknown.
- ""MEANT"": E in 2nd, M and T unknown.
- ""DEANS"": E in 2nd, D and S unknown.

We want to maximize information. Since we know A and N are fixed, we are trying to figure out the other three letters.

We have two unknown positions: 1, 2, and 5.

But note: we have to include E in either 1st or 2nd.

We also know that the word has E, and we are trying to find its position.

We can choose a word that uses common letters and doesn't repeat the same letters to test more.

We haven't used: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

Let me try to think of a word that has:
- First letter: a new letter (not C, R, and not E because we are putting E in 1st or 2nd, but we can use other letters).
- Second letter: similarly, a new letter.

And we must have A in 3rd and N in 4th.

So, for the pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A N [letter5]

We know letter1 and letter2 and letter5 must be from the alphabet except C and R.

And we must include E in either position 1 or 2.

Let me list possible words:

With E in 1st:
- ""ELAND"" -> E, L, A, N, D -> but we don't know L and D.
- ""EXAMS"" -> but no N in 4th.
- ""EATEN"" -> A in 2nd.

Another one: ""ELBOW"" -> but no N in 4th.

We need the 4th to be N.

So, ""ELAND"" and ""MEANT"" and ""DEANS"" are candidates.

With E in 2nd:
- ""LEANT"" -> L, E, A, N, T
- ""MEANT"" -> M, E, A, N, T
- ""DEANS"" -> D, E, A, N, S
- ""HEANS"" not a word.
- ""WEANS"" 4 letters.
- ""YEANS"" not common.

Also, ""PEANS"" -> P E A N S -> 1:P, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:S.

This fits.

Now, we have several options. We want to test letters that are common and haven't been tried.

In the first guess, we tried: C, R, A, N, E. We know A and N are in the word and in the correct positions, and E is in the word but misplaced. C and R are out.

So, we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to include as many of these as possible, avoiding C and R.

In the candidate words:
- ""ELAND"": uses E, L, D (and A, N). So new letters: L, D.
- ""MEANT"": uses M, E, T (and A, N). New letters: M, T.
- ""DEANS"": uses D, E, S (and A, N). New letters: D, S.

""PEANS"": P, E, A, N, S -> new letters: P, S.

We also have to consider that E is present, so we are confirming its position.

But note: we are not required to get the word right, but to get more information.

I think ""MEANT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters M and T, and we can see if they are in the word.

Similarly, ""LEANT"" uses L and T.

But let's see the frequency of letters. We might want to test letters that are more common.

Alternatively, we can try to avoid repeating the same letters to test more.

But note: we have to have A in 3rd and N in 4th, so we are stuck with that.

Another candidate: ""SLANT"" -> S L A N T -> 1:S, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T. This fits. And E is not included? But we must include E because it's in the word. So we cannot use ""SLANT"" because it doesn't have E.

We must include E.

So, let's choose between ""ELAND"", ""MEANT"", ""PEANS"", ""DEANS"", etc.

We can also consider ""OCEAN"" but C is out and E is in 4th? O C E A N -> C is out, and also E is in 3rd? 1:O, 2:C, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N -> doesn't fit pattern.

Another word: ""URBAN"" -> U R B A N -> R is out, and also A is in 4th? No, we need A in 3rd and N in 4th. Here A is in 4th and N in 5th? U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4), N(5). So pattern is _ _ _ A N, but we need A in 3rd and N in 4th. So no.

We must have the 3rd as A and 4th as N.

So, let's go with ""MEANT"". It has M, E, A, N, T. We know A and N are fixed, so we are testing M in 1st, E in 2nd, and T in 5th.

But note: in ""MEANT"", the E is in 2nd, which is a possibility.

Alternatively, ""PEANS"" has E in 2nd and S in 5th.

But we don't know if S is in the word.

I think ""MEANT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.

But let me check: we have to avoid C and R, and ""MEANT"" doesn't have them.

Similarly, ""LEANT"" is also good.

But in ""LEANT"", we have L in 1st and T in 5th.

We might also consider ""SLATE"" but C is out and pattern doesn't match.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has E in 1st and then test two new letters, and also test if E is in 1st.

But we don't know if E is in 1st or 2nd.

We have two possibilities: E in 1st or E in 2nd.

We can design a guess that helps us distinguish.

But we have to make a valid word.

I think ""MEANT"" is a solid choice.

But let me see: we have to test the position of E. If we put E in 2nd, and if it turns out to be correct, then we know E is in 2nd. If not, then E must be in 1st.

So, we can learn E's position from this guess.

Moreover, we test M and T.

So, I'll go with ""MEANT"".

But note: we are not forced to have the pattern _ _ A N _ with E? Actually, we are: because we know A is in 3rd and N in 4th, so the word must be one of the many that fit.

But we are guessing to get information.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't necessarily have E in 1st or 2nd? But we know E is in the word, so we must include it. And we must have A in 3rd and N in 4th.

So, we have to include E in 1st or 2nd.

We can choose one that tests more common letters.

I think ""MEANT"" is good.

But let me see if there is a word that has E in 1st and also tests other common letters.

For example, ""ELAND"" tests L and D.

But ""MEANT"" tests M and T.

Both are reasonable.

I'll choose ""MEANT"" because M and T are very common.

So, our next guess: ""MEANT""

But note: we are not sure if E is in 2nd. If it is, then we get E correct and we test M and T. If not, then we know E must be in 1st and we test M and T.

So, let's go with ""MEANT"".

<guess>meant</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and R are not in the word.
- A is in the correct 3rd position.
- N is in the correct 4th position.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

The secret word must have the pattern: _ _ A N _, with E present but not in the 5th position (so E must be in position 1 or 2). 

For the next guess, I chose ""meant"" because:
- It fits the pattern (_ _ A N _) with A in 3rd and N in 4th.
- It includes E in the 2nd position to test if that is correct (if E is in 2nd, it will get a check; if not, it will get a minus and we know E must be in 1st).
- It introduces new common letters (M and T) to gather more information.
- It avoids C and R, as required.

<guess>meant</guess>",meant,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 3rd letter)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the 4th letter)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The secret word has A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position. So the word pattern is: _ _ A N _
- The letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position (since it was in the 5th position in ""crane"" and got a '-', meaning it's present but misplaced). Also, note that E cannot be in the 3rd or 4th because those are fixed as A and N, and we know E is not in the 5th. So E must be in either the 1st or 2nd position.
- The letters C and R are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position.
- Includes the letter E, but not in the 5th position (and not in the 3rd or 4th, so only 1st or 2nd).
- Does not contain C or R.

Additionally, we should try to include other common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for E: 1st or 2nd.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ _ A N _ and contain E.

We can also consider that we have two unknown positions (1st and 2nd) and one unknown last position (5th). But note, we have to place E in one of the first two positions.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

We should avoid using C and R.

Let me try to list some words that fit the pattern:

- The word must have A in 3rd and N in 4th.

Examples:
- ""PLANE"": P L A N E -> but E is in the 5th, which we know is not allowed because the feedback for E was '-' meaning it's present but not in the 5th. Also, in ""crane"", E was in the 5th and we got '-', so E cannot be in 5th. Therefore, ""PLANE"" would put E in 5th again, which is invalid. So we avoid that.

We need a word with E in either 1st or 2nd.

Let me think of words with A in 3rd and N in 4th, and E in 1st or 2nd.

With E in 1st:
- ""E _ A N _"" -> e.g., ""ELAND"" (but L is unknown, and D is unknown). Also, we don't know if L or D are in the word.

But note: we have to avoid C and R.

""ELAND"": E L A N D -> pattern: E L A N D -> positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:D. This fits the pattern. And E is in 1st, which is allowed.

But we don't know if L and D are in the word. We can use this to test.

With E in 2nd:
- ""_ E A N _"" -> e.g., ""LEANT"" (but we know A is in 3rd, so this would be L E A N T -> 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T). This also fits. And E is in 2nd.

We also have to consider that the feedback for E was '-' meaning it's in the word but not in the 5th. Both ""ELAND"" and ""LEANT"" have E in 1st or 2nd, so that's okay.

But note: we have two unknown positions. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

We also know that the word does not contain C or R.

- ""LEANT"": meaning to lean or become lean. It's a valid word.
- ""ELAND"": a type of antelope. Valid.

But we might also consider other words.

Another possibility: ""DEIGN"" -> D E I G N -> but the pattern requires A in 3rd and N in 4th. In ""DEIGN"", the A is in 3rd and N in 5th? Wait, no: D(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). So it doesn't have A in 3rd. So invalid.

We must have A in 3rd and N in 4th.

Another word: ""MEANT"" -> M E A N T -> 1:M, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T. This fits. And E is in 2nd.

But we don't know if M and T are in the word.

Similarly, ""BEANT"" is not a word. ""YEANT"" is not common. ""HEANT"" not a word.

""MEANT"" is a word (meaning: to make mean or sullen).

But let's see: we have two candidates: ""ELAND"" and ""MEANT"".

We could also consider ""PAINT"": P A I N T -> but the pattern requires A in 3rd? In ""PAINT"": P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). So A is in 2nd, not 3rd. So invalid.

Another one: ""SAINT"" -> S A I N T -> A is in 2nd, not 3rd.

We need A in 3rd and N in 4th.

Another word: ""BLAND"" -> B L A N D -> 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:D. This fits. And E is not in this word? But we know E must be in the word because of the feedback. So we must include E.

We must include E because it is present.

So, ""BLAND"" does not have E, so it's invalid.

Similarly, ""PLANT"" has E in 5th, which is not allowed.

So, let's stick with words that have E and fit the pattern.

Words with E in 1st: ""ELAND"", ""EXAM"" (but ""EXAM"" has A in 3rd? E X A M -> 1:E, 2:X, 3:A, 4:M -> but we need N in 4th, not M. So ""EXAM"" doesn't have N in 4th.

We need the 4th to be N.

So, with E in 1st: 
- ""ELAND"": E L A N D -> 1:E, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:D
- ""EASTS"" is 5 letters? But ""EASTS"" has two S's and the pattern: E A S T S -> no, because A is in 2nd, not 3rd.

Another one: ""EATEN"" -> E A T E N -> A is in 2nd, not 3rd.

We need the third letter to be A.

So, ""ELAND"" and ""MEANT"" are candidates.

With E in 2nd:
- ""LEANT"": L E A N T -> 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T
- ""MEANT"": M E A N T -> same as above, but with M instead of L.
- ""WEANS"" is 4 letters. ""WEANT"" not a word.
- ""HEANS"" not a word.

Also, ""DEANS"" -> D E A N S -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:S. This fits. And E is in 2nd.

But we don't know if D and S are in the word.

Similarly, ""MEANS"" -> M E A N S -> same.

Now, we have:
- ""ELAND"": E in 1st, L and D unknown.
- ""MEANT"": E in 2nd, M and T unknown.
- ""DEANS"": E in 2nd, D and S unknown.

We want to maximize information. Since we know A and N are fixed, we are trying to figure out the other three letters.

We have two unknown positions: 1, 2, and 5.

But note: we have to include E in either 1st or 2nd.

We also know that the word has E, and we are trying to find its position.

We can choose a word that uses common letters and doesn't repeat the same letters to test more.

We haven't used: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

Let me try to think of a word that has:
- First letter: a new letter (not C, R, and not E because we are putting E in 1st or 2nd, but we can use other letters).
- Second letter: similarly, a new letter.

And we must have A in 3rd and N in 4th.

So, for the pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A N [letter5]

We know letter1 and letter2 and letter5 must be from the alphabet except C and R.

And we must include E in either position 1 or 2.

Let me list possible words:

With E in 1st:
- ""ELAND"" -> E, L, A, N, D -> but we don't know L and D.
- ""EXAMS"" -> but no N in 4th.
- ""EATEN"" -> A in 2nd.

Another one: ""ELBOW"" -> but no N in 4th.

We need the 4th to be N.

So, ""ELAND"" and ""MEANT"" and ""DEANS"" are candidates.

With E in 2nd:
- ""LEANT"" -> L, E, A, N, T
- ""MEANT"" -> M, E, A, N, T
- ""DEANS"" -> D, E, A, N, S
- ""HEANS"" not a word.
- ""WEANS"" 4 letters.
- ""YEANS"" not common.

Also, ""PEANS"" -> P E A N S -> 1:P, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:S.

This fits.

Now, we have several options. We want to test letters that are common and haven't been tried.

In the first guess, we tried: C, R, A, N, E. We know A and N are in the word and in the correct positions, and E is in the word but misplaced. C and R are out.

So, we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to include as many of these as possible, avoiding C and R.

In the candidate words:
- ""ELAND"": uses E, L, D (and A, N). So new letters: L, D.
- ""MEANT"": uses M, E, T (and A, N). New letters: M, T.
- ""DEANS"": uses D, E, S (and A, N). New letters: D, S.

""PEANS"": P, E, A, N, S -> new letters: P, S.

We also have to consider that E is present, so we are confirming its position.

But note: we are not required to get the word right, but to get more information.

I think ""MEANT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters M and T, and we can see if they are in the word.

Similarly, ""LEANT"" uses L and T.

But let's see the frequency of letters. We might want to test letters that are more common.

Alternatively, we can try to avoid repeating the same letters to test more.

But note: we have to have A in 3rd and N in 4th, so we are stuck with that.

Another candidate: ""SLANT"" -> S L A N T -> 1:S, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T. This fits. And E is not included? But we must include E because it's in the word. So we cannot use ""SLANT"" because it doesn't have E.

We must include E.

So, let's choose between ""ELAND"", ""MEANT"", ""PEANS"", ""DEANS"", etc.

We can also consider ""OCEAN"" but C is out and E is in 4th? O C E A N -> C is out, and also E is in 3rd? 1:O, 2:C, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N -> doesn't fit pattern.

Another word: ""URBAN"" -> U R B A N -> R is out, and also A is in 4th? No, we need A in 3rd and N in 4th. Here A is in 4th and N in 5th? U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4), N(5). So pattern is _ _ _ A N, but we need A in 3rd and N in 4th. So no.

We must have the 3rd as A and 4th as N.

So, let's go with ""MEANT"". It has M, E, A, N, T. We know A and N are fixed, so we are testing M in 1st, E in 2nd, and T in 5th.

But note: in ""MEANT"", the E is in 2nd, which is a possibility.

Alternatively, ""PEANS"" has E in 2nd and S in 5th.

But we don't know if S is in the word.

I think ""MEANT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.

But let me check: we have to avoid C and R, and ""MEANT"" doesn't have them.

Similarly, ""LEANT"" is also good.

But in ""LEANT"", we have L in 1st and T in 5th.

We might also consider ""SLATE"" but C is out and pattern doesn't match.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has E in 1st and then test two new letters, and also test if E is in 1st.

But we don't know if E is in 1st or 2nd.

We have two possibilities: E in 1st or E in 2nd.

We can design a guess that helps us distinguish.

But we have to make a valid word.

I think ""MEANT"" is a solid choice.

But let me see: we have to test the position of E. If we put E in 2nd, and if it turns out to be correct, then we know E is in 2nd. If not, then E must be in 1st.

So, we can learn E's position from this guess.

Moreover, we test M and T.

So, I'll go with ""MEANT"".

But note: we are not forced to have the pattern _ _ A N _ with E? Actually, we are: because we know A is in 3rd and N in 4th, so the word must be one of the many that fit.

But we are guessing to get information.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't necessarily have E in 1st or 2nd? But we know E is in the word, so we must include it. And we must have A in 3rd and N in 4th.

So, we have to include E in 1st or 2nd.

We can choose one that tests more common letters.

I think ""MEANT"" is good.

But let me see if there is a word that has E in 1st and also tests other common letters.

For example, ""ELAND"" tests L and D.

But ""MEANT"" tests M and T.

Both are reasonable.

I'll choose ""MEANT"" because M and T are very common.

So, our next guess: ""MEANT""

But note: we are not sure if E is in 2nd. If it is, then we get E correct and we test M and T. If not, then we know E must be in 1st and we test M and T.

So, let's go with ""MEANT"".

<guess>meant</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and R are not in the word.
- A is in the correct 3rd position.
- N is in the correct 4th position.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

The secret word must have the pattern: _ _ A N _, with E present but not in the 5th position (so E must be in position 1 or 2). 

For the next guess, I chose ""meant"" because:
- It fits the pattern (_ _ A N _) with A in 3rd and N in 4th.
- It includes E in the 2nd position to test if that is correct (if E is in 2nd, it will get a check; if not, it will get a minus and we know E must be in 1st).
- It introduces new common letters (M and T) to gather more information.
- It avoids C and R, as required.",Guess 2: meant -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) E(✓) A(✓) N(✓) T(x),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 07 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(-)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 3rd letter)
- N: ✓ (correct position, so N is the 4th letter)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The secret word has A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position. So the word pattern is: _ _ A N _
- The letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position (since it was in the 5th position in ""crane"" and got a '-', meaning it's present but misplaced). Also, note that E cannot be in the 3rd or 4th because those are fixed as A and N, and we know E is not in the 5th. So E must be in either the 1st or 2nd position.
- The letters C and R are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Has A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position.
- Includes the letter E, but not in the 5th position (and not in the 3rd or 4th, so only 1st or 2nd).
- Does not contain C or R.

Additionally, we should try to include other common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for E: 1st or 2nd.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ _ A N _ and contain E.

We can also consider that we have two unknown positions (1st and 2nd) and one unknown last position (5th). But note, we have to place E in one of the first two positions.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

We should avoid using C and R.

Let me try to list some words that fit the pattern:

- The word must have A in 3rd and N in 4th.

Examples:
- ""PLANE"": P L A N E -> but E is in the 5th, which we know is not allowed because the feedback for E was '-' meaning it's present but not in the 5th. Also, in ""crane"", E was in the 5th and we got '-', so E cannot be in 5th. Therefore, ""PLANE"" would put E in 5th again, which is invalid. So we avoid that.

We need a word with E in either 1st or 2nd.

Let me think of words with A in 3rd and N in 4th, and E in 1st or 2nd.

With E in 1st:
- ""E _ A N _"" -> e.g., ""ELAND"" (but L is unknown, and D is unknown). Also, we don't know if L or D are in the word.

But note: we have to avoid C and R.

""ELAND"": E L A N D -> pattern: E L A N D -> positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:D. This fits the pattern. And E is in 1st, which is allowed.

But we don't know if L and D are in the word. We can use this to test.

With E in 2nd:
- ""_ E A N _"" -> e.g., ""LEANT"" (but we know A is in 3rd, so this would be L E A N T -> 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T). This also fits. And E is in 2nd.

We also have to consider that the feedback for E was '-' meaning it's in the word but not in the 5th. Both ""ELAND"" and ""LEANT"" have E in 1st or 2nd, so that's okay.

But note: we have two unknown positions. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

We also know that the word does not contain C or R.

Let me check common words:

- ""LEANT"": meaning to lean or become lean. It's a valid word.
- ""ELAND"": a type of antelope. Valid.

But we might also consider other words.

Another possibility: ""DEIGN"" -> D E I G N -> but the pattern requires A in 3rd and N in 4th. In ""DEIGN"", the A is in 3rd and N in 5th? Wait, no: D(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). So it doesn't have A in 3rd. So invalid.

We must have A in 3rd and N in 4th.

Another word: ""MEANT"" -> M E A N T -> 1:M, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T. This fits. And E is in 2nd.

But we don't know if M and T are in the word.

Similarly, ""BEANT"" is not a word. ""YEANT"" is not common. ""HEANT"" not a word.

""MEANT"" is a word (meaning: to make mean or sullen).

But let's see: we have two candidates: ""ELAND"" and ""MEANT"".

We could also consider ""PAINT"": P A I N T -> but the pattern requires A in 3rd? In ""PAINT"": P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). So A is in 2nd, not 3rd. So invalid.

Another one: ""SAINT"" -> S A I N T -> A is in 2nd, not 3rd.

We need A in 3rd and N in 4th.

Another word: ""BLAND"" -> B L A N D -> 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:D. This fits. And E is not in this word? But we know E must be in the word because of the feedback. So we must include E.

We must include E because it is present.

So, ""BLAND"" does not have E, so it's invalid.

Similarly, ""PLANT"" has E in 5th, which is not allowed.

So, let's stick with words that have E and fit the pattern.

Words with E in 1st: ""ELAND"", ""EXAM"" (but ""EXAM"" has A in 3rd? E X A M -> 1:E, 2:X, 3:A, 4:M -> but we need N in 4th, not M. So ""EXAM"" doesn't have N in 4th.

We need the 4th to be N.

So, with E in 1st: 
- ""ELAND"": E L A N D -> 1:E, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:D
- ""EASTS"" is 5 letters? But ""EASTS"" has two S's and the pattern: E A S T S -> no, because A is in 2nd, not 3rd.

Another one: ""EATEN"" -> E A T E N -> A is in 2nd, not 3rd.

We need the third letter to be A.

So, ""ELAND"" and ""MEANT"" are candidates.

With E in 2nd:
- ""LEANT"": L E A N T -> 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T
- ""MEANT"": M E A N T -> same as above, but with M instead of L.
- ""WEANS"" is 4 letters. ""WEANT"" not a word.
- ""HEANS"" not a word.

Also, ""DEANS"" -> D E A N S -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:S. This fits. And E is in 2nd.

But we don't know if D and S are in the word.

Similarly, ""MEANS"" -> M E A N S -> same.

Now, we have:
- ""ELAND"": E in 1st, L and D unknown.
- ""MEANT"": E in 2nd, M and T unknown.
- ""DEANS"": E in 2nd, D and S unknown.

We want to maximize information. Since we know A and N are fixed, we are trying to figure out the other three letters.

We have two unknown positions: 1, 2, and 5.

But note: we have to include E in either 1st or 2nd.

We also know that the word has E, and we are trying to find its position.

We can choose a word that uses common letters and doesn't repeat the same letters to test more.

We haven't used: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

Let me try to think of a word that has:
- First letter: a new letter (not C, R, and not E because we are putting E in 1st or 2nd, but we can use other letters).
- Second letter: similarly, a new letter.

And we must have A in 3rd and N in 4th.

So, for the pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A N [letter5]

We know letter1 and letter2 and letter5 must be from the alphabet except C and R.

And we must include E in either position 1 or 2.

Let me list possible words:

With E in 1st:
- ""ELAND"" -> E, L, A, N, D -> but we don't know L and D.
- ""EXAMS"" -> but no N in 4th.
- ""EATEN"" -> A in 2nd.

Another one: ""ELBOW"" -> but no N in 4th.

We need the 4th to be N.

So, ""ELAND"" and ""MEANT"" and ""DEANS"" are candidates.

With E in 2nd:
- ""LEANT"" -> L, E, A, N, T
- ""MEANT"" -> M, E, A, N, T
- ""DEANS"" -> D, E, A, N, S
- ""HEANS"" not a word.
- ""WEANS"" 4 letters.
- ""YEANS"" not common.

Also, ""PEANS"" -> P E A N S -> 1:P, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:S.

This fits.

Now, we have several options. We want to test letters that are common and haven't been tried.

In the first guess, we tried: C, R, A, N, E. We know A and N are in the word and in the correct positions, and E is in the word but misplaced. C and R are out.

So, we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should try to include as many of these as possible, avoiding C and R.

In the candidate words:
- ""ELAND"": uses E, L, D (and A, N). So new letters: L, D.
- ""MEANT"": uses M, E, T (and A, N). New letters: M, T.
- ""DEANS"": uses D, E, S (and A, N). New letters: D, S.

""PEANS"": P, E, A, N, S -> new letters: P, S.

We also have to consider that E is present, so we are confirming its position.

But note: we are not required to get the word right, but to get more information.

I think ""MEANT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters M and T, and we can see if they are in the word.

Similarly, ""LEANT"" uses L and T.

But let's see the frequency of letters. We might want to test letters that are more common.

Alternatively, we can try to avoid repeating the same letters to test more.

But note: we have to have A in 3rd and N in 4th, so we are stuck with that.

Another candidate: ""SLANT"" -> S L A N T -> 1:S, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T. This fits. And E is not included? But we must include E because it's in the word. So we cannot use ""SLANT"" because it doesn't have E.

We must include E.

So, let's choose between ""ELAND"", ""MEANT"", ""PEANS"", ""DEANS"", etc.

We can also consider ""OCEAN"" but C is out and E is in 4th? O C E A N -> C is out, and also E is in 3rd? 1:O, 2:C, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N -> doesn't fit pattern.

Another word: ""URBAN"" -> U R B A N -> R is out, and also A is in 4th? No, we need A in 3rd and N in 4th. Here A is in 4th and N in 5th? U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4), N(5). So pattern is _ _ _ A N, but we need A in 3rd and N in 4th. So no.

We must have the 3rd as A and 4th as N.

So, let's go with ""MEANT"". It has M, E, A, N, T. We know A and N are fixed, so we are testing M in 1st, E in 2nd, and T in 5th.

But note: in ""MEANT"", the E is in 2nd, which is a possibility.

Alternatively, ""PEANS"" has E in 2nd and S in 5th.

But we don't know if S is in the word.

I think ""MEANT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.

But let me check: we have to avoid C and R, and ""MEANT"" doesn't have them.

Similarly, ""LEANT"" is also good.

But in ""LEANT"", we have L in 1st and T in 5th.

We might also consider ""SLATE"" but C is out and pattern doesn't match.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has E in 1st and then test two new letters, and also test if E is in 1st.

But we don't know if E is in 1st or 2nd.

We have two possibilities: E in 1st or E in 2nd.

We can design a guess that helps us distinguish.

But we have to make a valid word.

I think ""MEANT"" is a solid choice.

But let me see: we have to test the position of E. If we put E in 2nd, and if it turns out to be correct, then we know E is in 2nd. If not, then E must be in 1st.

So, we can learn E's position from this guess.

Moreover, we test M and T.

So, I'll go with ""MEANT"".

But note: we are not forced to have the pattern _ _ A N _ with E? Actually, we are: because we know A is in 3rd and N in 4th, so the word must be one of the many that fit.

But we are guessing to get information.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't necessarily have E in 1st or 2nd? But we know E is in the word, so we must include it. And we must have A in 3rd and N in 4th.

So, we have to include E in 1st or 2nd.

We can choose one that tests more common letters.

I think ""MEANT"" is good.

But let me see if there is a word that has E in 1st and also tests other common letters.

For example, ""ELAND"" tests L and D.

But ""MEANT"" tests M and T.

Both are reasonable.

I'll choose ""MEANT"" because M and T are very common.

So, our next guess: ""MEANT""

But note: we are not sure if E is in 2nd. If it is, then we get E correct and we test M and T. If not, then we know E must be in 1st and we test M and T.

So, let's go with ""MEANT"".

<guess>meant</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and R are not in the word.
- A is in the correct 3rd position.
- N is in the correct 4th position.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.

The secret word must have the pattern: _ _ A N _, with E present but not in the 5th position (so E must be in position 1 or 2). 

For the next guess, I chose ""meant"" because:
- It fits the pattern (_ _ A N _) with A in 3rd and N in 4th.
- It includes E in the 2nd position to test if that is correct (if E is in 2nd, it will get a check; if not, it will get a minus and we know E must be in 1st).
- It introduces new common letters (M and T) to gather more information.
- It avoids C and R, as required.

So the word pattern is: _ _ A N _\n- The letter E is in the word but not in the 5th position (since it was in the 5th position in ""crane"" and got a \'-\', meaning it\'s present but misplaced). Also, note that E cannot be in the 3rd or 4th because those are fixed as A and N, and we know E is not in the 5th. So E must be in either the 1st or 2nd position.\n- The letters C and R are not in the word at all.\n\nWe must choose a new 5-letter word that:\n- Has A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position.\n- Includes the letter E, but not in the 5th position (and not in the 3rd or 4th, so only 1st or 2nd).\n- Does not contain C or R.\n\nAdditionally, we should try to include other common letters to get more information.\n\nPossible positions for E: 1st or 2nd.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit the pattern _ _ A N _ and contain E.\n\nWe can also consider that we have two unknown positions (1st and 2nd) and one unknown last position (5th). But note, we have to place E in one of the first two positions.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.\n\nWe should avoid using C and R.\n\nLet me try to list some words that fit the pattern:\n\n- The word must have A in 3rd and N in 4th.\n\nExamples:\n- ""PLANE"": P L A N E -> but E is in the 5th, which we know is not allowed because the feedback for E was \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not in the 5th. Also, in ""crane"", E was in the 5th and we got \'-\', so E cannot be in 5th. Therefore, ""PLANE"" would put E in 5th again, which is invalid. So we avoid that.\n\nWe need a word with E in either 1st or 2nd.\n\nLet me think of words with A in 3rd and N in 4th, and E in 1st or 2nd.\n\nWith E in 1st:\n- ""E _ A N _"" -> e.g., ""ELAND"" (but L is unknown, and D is unknown). Also, we don\'t know if L or D are in the word.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid C and R.\n\n""ELAND"": E L A N D -> pattern: E L A N D -> positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:D. This fits the pattern. And E is in 1st, which is allowed.\n\nBut we don\'t know if L and D are in the word. We can use this to test.\n\nWith E in 2nd:\n- ""_ E A N _"" -> e.g., ""LEANT"" (but we know A is in 3rd, so this would be L E A N T -> 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T). This also fits. And E is in 2nd.\n\nWe also have to consider that the feedback for E was \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not in the 5th. Both ""ELAND"" and ""LEANT"" have E in 1st or 2nd, so that\'s okay.\n\nBut note: we have two unknown positions. We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nWe also know that the word does not contain C or R.\n\nLet me check common words:\n\n- ""LEANT"": meaning to lean or become lean. It\'s a valid word.\n- ""ELAND"": a type of antelope. Valid.\n\nBut we might also consider other words.\n\nAnother possibility: ""DEIGN"" -> D E I G N -> but the pattern requires A in 3rd and N in 4th. In ""DEIGN"", the A is in 3rd and N in 5th? Wait, no: D(1), E(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). So it doesn\'t have A in 3rd. So invalid.\n\nWe must have A in 3rd and N in 4th.\n\nAnother word: ""MEANT"" -> M E A N T -> 1:M, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T. This fits. And E is in 2nd.\n\nBut we don\'t know if M and T are in the word.\n\nSimilarly, ""BEANT"" is not a word. ""YEANT"" is not common. ""HEANT"" not a word.\n\n""MEANT"" is a word (meaning: to make mean or sullen).\n\nBut let\'s see: we have two candidates: ""ELAND"" and ""MEANT"".\n\nWe could also consider ""PAINT"": P A I N T -> but the pattern requires A in 3rd? In ""PAINT"": P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). So A is in 2nd, not 3rd. So invalid.\n\nAnother one: ""SAINT"" -> S A I N T -> A is in 2nd, not 3rd.\n\nWe need A in 3rd and N in 4th.\n\nAnother word: ""BLAND"" -> B L A N D -> 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:D. This fits. And E is not in this word? But we know E must be in the word because of the feedback. So we must include E.\n\nWe must include E because it is present.\n\nSo, ""BLAND"" does not have E, so it\'s invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""PLANT"" has E in 5th, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, let\'s stick with words that have E and fit the pattern.\n\nWords with E in 1st: ""ELAND"", ""EXAM"" (but ""EXAM"" has A in 3rd? E X A M -> 1:E, 2:X, 3:A, 4:M -> but we need N in 4th, not M. So ""EXAM"" doesn\'t have N in 4th.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N.\n\nSo, with E in 1st: \n- ""ELAND"": E L A N D -> 1:E, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:D\n- ""EASTS"" is 5 letters? But ""EASTS"" has two S\'s and the pattern: E A S T S -> no, because A is in 2nd, not 3rd.\n\nAnother one: ""EATEN"" -> E A T E N -> A is in 2nd, not 3rd.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A.\n\nSo, ""ELAND"" and ""MEANT"" are candidates.\n\nWith E in 2nd:\n- ""LEANT"": L E A N T -> 1:L, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T\n- ""MEANT"": M E A N T -> same as above, but with M instead of L.\n- ""WEANS"" is 4 letters. ""WEANT"" not a word.\n- ""HEANS"" not a word.\n\nAlso, ""DEANS"" -> D E A N S -> 1:D, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:S. This fits. And E is in 2nd.\n\nBut we don\'t know if D and S are in the word.\n\nSimilarly, ""MEANS"" -> M E A N S -> same.\n\nNow, we have:\n- ""ELAND"": E in 1st, L and D unknown.\n- ""MEANT"": E in 2nd, M and T unknown.\n- ""DEANS"": E in 2nd, D and S unknown.\n\nWe want to maximize information. Since we know A and N are fixed, we are trying to figure out the other three letters.\n\nWe have two unknown positions: 1, 2, and 5.\n\nBut note: we have to include E in either 1st or 2nd.\n\nWe also know that the word has E, and we are trying to find its position.\n\nWe can choose a word that uses common letters and doesn\'t repeat the same letters to test more.\n\nWe haven\'t used: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.\n\nLet me try to think of a word that has:\n- First letter: a new letter (not C, R, and not E because we are putting E in 1st or 2nd, but we can use other letters).\n- Second letter: similarly, a new letter.\n\nAnd we must have A in 3rd and N in 4th.\n\nSo, for the pattern: [letter1] [letter2] A N [letter5]\n\nWe know letter1 and letter2 and letter5 must be from the alphabet except C and R.\n\nAnd we must include E in either position 1 or 2.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n\nWith E in 1st:\n- ""ELAND"" -> E, L, A, N, D -> but we don\'t know L and D.\n- ""EXAMS"" -> but no N in 4th.\n- ""EATEN"" -> A in 2nd.\n\nAnother one: ""ELBOW"" -> but no N in 4th.\n\nWe need the 4th to be N.\n\nSo, ""ELAND"" and ""MEANT"" and ""DEANS"" are candidates.\n\nWith E in 2nd:\n- ""LEANT"" -> L, E, A, N, T\n- ""MEANT"" -> M, E, A, N, T\n- ""DEANS"" -> D, E, A, N, S\n- ""HEANS"" not a word.\n- ""WEANS"" 4 letters.\n- ""YEANS"" not common.\n\nAlso, ""PEANS"" -> P E A N S -> 1:P, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N, 5:S.\n\nThis fits.\n\nNow, we have several options. We want to test letters that are common and haven\'t been tried.\n\nIn the first guess, we tried: C, R, A, N, E. We know A and N are in the word and in the correct positions, and E is in the word but misplaced. C and R are out.\n\nSo, we haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe should try to include as many of these as possible, avoiding C and R.\n\nIn the candidate words:\n- ""ELAND"": uses E, L, D (and A, N). So new letters: L, D.\n- ""MEANT"": uses M, E, T (and A, N). New letters: M, T.\n- ""DEANS"": uses D, E, S (and A, N). New letters: D, S.\n\n""PEANS"": P, E, A, N, S -> new letters: P, S.\n\nWe also have to consider that E is present, so we are confirming its position.\n\nBut note: we are not required to get the word right, but to get more information.\n\nI think ""MEANT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters M and T, and we can see if they are in the word.\n\nSimilarly, ""LEANT"" uses L and T.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency of letters. We might want to test letters that are more common.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to avoid repeating the same letters to test more.\n\nBut note: we have to have A in 3rd and N in 4th, so we are stuck with that.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SLANT"" -> S L A N T -> 1:S, 2:L, 3:A, 4:N, 5:T. This fits. And E is not included? But we must include E because it\'s in the word. So we cannot use ""SLANT"" because it doesn\'t have E.\n\nWe must include E.\n\nSo, let\'s choose between ""ELAND"", ""MEANT"", ""PEANS"", ""DEANS"", etc.\n\nWe can also consider ""OCEAN"" but C is out and E is in 4th? O C E A N -> C is out, and also E is in 3rd? 1:O, 2:C, 3:E, 4:A, 5:N -> doesn\'t fit pattern.\n\nAnother word: ""URBAN"" -> U R B A N -> R is out, and also A is in 4th? No, we need A in 3rd and N in 4th. Here A is in 4th and N in 5th? U(1), R(2), B(3), A(4), N(5). So pattern is _ _ _ A N, but we need A in 3rd and N in 4th. So no.\n\nWe must have the 3rd as A and 4th as N.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""MEANT"". It has M, E, A, N, T. We know A and N are fixed, so we are testing M in 1st, E in 2nd, and T in 5th.\n\nBut note: in ""MEANT"", the E is in 2nd, which is a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, ""PEANS"" has E in 2nd and S in 5th.\n\nBut we don\'t know if S is in the word.\n\nI think ""MEANT"" is a good choice because it uses common letters.\n\nBut let me check: we have to avoid C and R, and ""MEANT"" doesn\'t have them.\n\nSimilarly, ""LEANT"" is also good.\n\nBut in ""LEANT"", we have L in 1st and T in 5th.\n\nWe might also consider ""SLATE"" but C is out and pattern doesn\'t match.\n\nAnother idea: we can try to use a word that has E in 1st and then test two new letters, and also test if E is in 1st.\n\nBut we don\'t know if E is in 1st or 2nd.\n\nWe have two possibilities: E in 1st or E in 2nd.\n\nWe can design a guess that helps us distinguish.\n\nBut we have to make a valid word.\n\nI think ""MEANT"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let me see: we have to test the position of E. If we put E in 2nd, and if it turns out to be correct, then we know E is in 2nd. If not, then E must be in 1st.\n\nSo, we can learn E\'s position from this guess.\n\nMoreover, we test M and T.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""MEANT"".\n\nBut note: we are not forced to have the pattern _ _ A N _ with E? Actually, we are: because we know A is in 3rd and N in 4th, so the word must be one of the many that fit.\n\nBut we are guessing to get information.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t necessarily have E in 1st or 2nd? But we know E is in the word, so we must include it. And we must have A in 3rd and N in 4th.\n\nSo, we have to include E in 1st or 2nd.\n\nWe can choose one that tests more common letters.\n\nI think ""MEANT"" is good.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that has E in 1st and also tests other common letters.\n\nFor example, ""ELAND"" tests L and D.\n\nBut ""MEANT"" tests M and T.\n\nBoth are reasonable.\n\nI\'ll choose ""MEANT"" because M and T are very common.\n\nSo, our next guess: ""MEANT""\n\nBut note: we are not sure if E is in 2nd. If it is, then we get E correct and we test M and T. If not, then we know E must be in 1st and we test M and T.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""MEANT"".\n\n<guess>meant</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C and R are not in the word.\n- A is in the correct 3rd position.\n- N is in the correct 4th position.\n- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.\n\nThe secret word must have the pattern: _ _ A N _, with E present but not in the 5th position (so E must be in position 1 or 2). \n\nFor the next guess, I chose ""meant"" because:\n- It fits the pattern (_ _ A N _) with A in 3rd and N in 4th.\n- It includes E in the 2nd position to test if that is correct (if E is in 2nd, it will get a check; if not, it will get a minus and we know E must be in 1st).\n- It introduces new common letters (M and T) to gather more information.\n- It avoids C and R, as required.\n\n<guess>meant</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(-)\nGuess 2: meant -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) E(✓) A(✓) N(✓) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd letter)
- N: ✓ (correct position, 4th letter)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

Guess 2: ""meant""
- M: ✓ (correct position, 1st letter)
- E: ✓ (correct position, 2nd letter)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd letter)
- N: ✓ (correct position, 4th letter)
- T: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:
1. The word starts with M (from meant's feedback: M✓).
2. The second letter is E (from meant's feedback: E✓).
3. The third letter is A (from both guesses: A✓ in crane and meant).
4. The fourth letter is N (from both guesses: N✓).
5. The fifth letter is unknown, but T is not in the word (from meant's feedback: Tx).

Also, from the first guess, we know that E is in the word but not in the 5th position. However, now we know E is in the 2nd position, so that's consistent.

Now, the secret word has the pattern: M E A N ?

We know the 5th letter cannot be T (from the second guess) and also cannot be C or R (from the first guess). Additionally, we know that the letter in the 5th must be one that hasn't been ruled out.

We also know that E is in the word, but we now know its exact position (2nd). So the E in the first guess (who was misplaced) was because it was in the wrong position, but now we know it's in the 2nd.

So, the word is ""M E A N ?"".

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""MEAN"", ends with a letter that is not C, R, T (and also not M, E, A, N because we already know they are in the word, but the 5th could be a new letter).

But note: the word must be a valid English word.

Common words that fit ""MEAN_"":
- ""MEANS"": but S is not ruled out, and we haven't tested S. However, in the first guess we had E as misplaced, but now we know E is in 2nd, so ""MEANS"" would have E in 2nd and S in 5th. But we don't know about S yet.
- ""MEALY"": but L and Y. We haven't tested L and Y.
- ""MEANY"": but Y is unknown, and we haven't tested Y.
- ""MEANT"": we already guessed, and T is not in the word, so T is out.

But we know T is not in the word, so ""MEANT"" is incorrect.

Similarly, ""MEANS"" is a possibility.

But we also have to consider that the first guess had E as present but misplaced, and now we know E is in 2nd. So ""MEANS"" has E in 2nd, which is correct, and S in 5th.

But we don't know if S is in the word.

Other possibilities:
- ""MEALY"": M E A L Y -> 5th letter Y.
- ""MEANY"": M E A N Y -> but this has N in 4th and A in 3rd, which are fixed, and then Y in 5th. But we haven't tested Y.

But note: we have to avoid T, C, R.

""MEANS"": letters M, E, A, N, S -> no T, C, R. S is a new letter.

""MEALY"": M, E, A, L, Y -> no T, C, R, L and Y are new.

""MEANY"": M, E, A, N, Y -> same.

But we also have to consider that the first guess had E as present but misplaced. In ""MEANS"", E is in 2nd, which is a new position. Similarly, in ""MEALY"", E is in 2nd.

But we don't have any information about S, L, Y, etc.

We can guess ""MEANS"" to test S.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We can try to guess the word if we are confident.

Alternatively, we can use this guess to test multiple possibilities.

But we know the word is ""MEAN?"" and we have to find the last letter.

We can list possible words:

- ""MEANS"": S at the end.
- ""MEALY"": L and Y.
- ""MEANY"": Y.
- ""MEANT"": T is out, so not.
- ""MEANS"" is the most common.

But we also have ""MEATY"", but T is out and also the pattern: M E A T Y -> but T is out and the 4th letter is T, which we know is not in the word? From the second guess, T is not in the word, so ""MEATY"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""MEARY"" is not a word.

""MEANS"" is a valid word.

But we don't know if S is in the word.

We can also consider ""MEDIA"" but that has D and I, and the pattern: M E D I A -> but we need A in 3rd and N in 4th. This doesn't fit.

Another one: ""MELON"" -> M E L O N -> but the 3rd letter is L, not A. So no.

We must have A in 3rd and N in 4th.

So, the word must be one of: ""MEANS"", ""MEALY"", ""MEANY"", etc.

But ""MEANT"" is out because T is not in the word.

We can also check ""MEANS"" because it's a common word.

But we have to be cautious: the feedback from the first guess said E is present but not in 5th, and now we have E in 2nd. So ""MEANS"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""MEALY"" is a candidate.

But we don't have any information about the 5th letter.

We can guess ""MEANS"" and if it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on S.

But we are on the third guess, so we can try.

Alternatively, we can use a guess that tests multiple options, but since the first three letters are fixed, we are only testing the last letter.

But we have to make a valid word.

Another idea: we can guess a word that has the same first four letters but a different last letter to test, but we are constrained by the pattern.

We can only change the last letter.

So, we have to guess one of the possibilities.

But we have multiple options: ""MEANS"", ""MEALY"", ""MEANY"", etc.

We can choose ""MEANS"" because it's the most common.

But let me see: we have not tested S, L, Y, etc.

We can also consider that the first guess had E as present, but we now know it's in 2nd, so that doesn't help.

We might also note that the word ""MEANS"" uses S, which is a common letter.

Similarly, ""MEALY"" uses L and Y.

But we don't have any information about L or Y.

So, I think we should guess ""MEANS"".

But wait, what if the word is ""MEANY""? Then we guess ""MEANS"" and get feedback that S is not in the word, then we can try ""MEANY"" next.

But we have to make a guess.

We can also think: if we guess ""MEANS"" and it's wrong, we get feedback on S. Then we can adjust.

But we have only 6 tries, so we can try to guess the word.

Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't have E in 2nd? But we know E is in the word and must be in 1st or 2nd, but we are putting it in 2nd. If it's not there, then it must be in 1st.

But we are guessing to get the word.

I think ""MEANS"" is a good guess.

But let me check: in the first guess, we had E as present but misplaced. Now we know E is in 2nd. So the word is ""MEAN"" plus one more letter.

We can also consider ""MEATY"" but T is out.

Another word: ""MEADOW"" is 5 letters? M E A D O W -> but that's 5 letters? M, E, A, D, O, W -> but the pattern is M E A D O W, which doesn't have N in 4th. So no.

We must have N in 4th.

So, the only possibilities are words ending with S, L, Y, etc.

But we can also have ""MEANS"", ""MEALY"", ""MEANY"".

But ""MEANT"" is out.

We can also check ""MEGS"" but no N in 4th.

Another one: ""MELON"" doesn't fit.

So, I think the common ones are ""MEANS"", ""MEALY"", ""MEANY"".

We can try ""MEANS"" first.

But note: we have to avoid using letters that are already known to be absent. We know C, R, T are absent, so we avoid them.

In ""MEANS"", the last letter S is not ruled out.

Similarly, in ""MEALY"", L and Y are not ruled out.

But we have no information about L or Y.

We can also consider ""MEOID"" but no N in 4th.

I think we should guess ""MEANS"".

But let me see if there is a word that uses a letter we haven't tried to see if it's present.

But in this case, we are forced to have the first four letters fixed, so we can only change the last letter.

So, I'll go with ""MEANS"".

But wait, what if the word is ""MEANY""? Then we guess ""MEANS"" and get S wrong, then we try ""MEANY"" next.

But we have 4 more guesses, so it's okay.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has the same letters as ""MEANS"" but different last letter? But we can't because the last letter is the only unknown, and we are testing it.

We can guess ""MEALY"" to test L and Y.

But I think ""MEANS"" is a good guess.

So, our next guess: ""MEANS""

But let me confirm: the pattern is M E A N S.

If we guess ""MEANS"", and if it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on S.

But note: we know from the first guess that E is not in the 5th, and now we have E in 2nd, so that's fine.

Also, in ""MEANS"", the S is in 5th, which is a new position.

So, I think it's a good guess.

But we have to make sure that S is not ruled out. It isn't.

So, I'll go with ""MEANS"".

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(-)  
  - A is in the correct 3rd position.  
  - N is in the correct 4th position.  
  - E is in the word but not in the 5th position.  
  - C and R are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: meant** → Feedback: M(✓), E(✓), A(✓), N(✓), T(x)  
  - M is in the correct 1st position.  
  - E is in the correct 2nd position.  
  - A is confirmed in the 3rd position.  
  - N is confirmed in the 4th position.  
  - T is not in the word.  

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: **M E A N _** (positions 1–4 are confirmed as M, E, A, N).  
- The 5th position is unknown.  
- We know:  
  - E is in the word (from Guess 1) but is now confirmed in the 2nd position, so the previous feedback about E (being misplaced in Guess 1) is consistent.  
  - The 5th letter cannot be T (from Guess 2), C (from Guess 1), or R (from Guess 1).  
- The only plausible candidates are common 5-letter words starting with ""MEAN"" and ending with a letter that hasn't been ruled out, such as:  
  - **MEANS** (ends with S)  
  - **MEALY** (ends with L and Y)  
  - **MEANY** (ends with Y)  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **MEANS** is the most common word fitting the pattern and tests the letter S (which hasn't been evaluated).  
- If correct, we solve the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on S will confirm if it's in the word (and if so, its position) or absent, narrowing down to **MEALY** or **MEANY** for subsequent guesses.  
- This guess efficiently leverages the known pattern while testing a new high-frequency letter (S).  

<guess>means</guess>",means,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd letter)
- N: ✓ (correct position, 4th letter)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

Guess 2: ""meant""
- M: ✓ (correct position, 1st letter)
- E: ✓ (correct position, 2nd letter)
- A: ✓ (correct position, 3rd letter)
- N: ✓ (correct position, 4th letter)
- T: x (not in the word)

From this, we can deduce:
1. The word starts with M (from meant's feedback: M✓).
2. The second letter is E (from meant's feedback: E✓).
3. The third letter is A (from both guesses: A✓ in crane and meant).
4. The fourth letter is N (from both guesses: N✓).
5. The fifth letter is unknown, but T is not in the word (from meant's feedback: Tx).

Also, from the first guess, we know that E is in the word but not in the 5th position. However, now we know E is in the 2nd position, so that's consistent.

Now, the secret word has the pattern: M E A N ?

We know the 5th letter cannot be T (from the second guess) and also cannot be C or R (from the first guess). Additionally, we know that the letter in the 5th must be one that hasn't been ruled out.

We also know that E is in the word, but we now know its exact position (2nd). So the E in the first guess (who was misplaced) was because it was in the wrong position, but now we know it's in the 2nd.

So, the word is ""M E A N ?"".

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""MEAN"", ends with a letter that is not C, R, T (and also not M, E, A, N because we already know they are in the word, but the 5th could be a new letter).

But note: the word must be a valid English word.

Common words that fit ""MEAN_"":
- ""MEANS"": but S is not ruled out, and we haven't tested S. However, in the first guess we had E as misplaced, but now we know E is in 2nd, so ""MEANS"" would have E in 2nd and S in 5th. But we don't know about S yet.
- ""MEALY"": but L and Y. We haven't tested L and Y.
- ""MEANY"": but Y is unknown, and we haven't tested Y.
- ""MEANT"": we already guessed, and T is not in the word, so T is out.

But we know T is not in the word, so ""MEANT"" is incorrect.

Similarly, ""MEANS"" is a possibility.

But we also have to consider that the first guess had E as present but misplaced, and now we know E is in 2nd. So ""MEANS"" has E in 2nd, which is correct, and S in 5th.

But we don't know if S is in the word.

Other possibilities:
- ""MEALY"": M E A L Y -> 5th letter Y.
- ""MEANY"": M E A N Y -> but this has N in 4th and A in 3rd, which are fixed, and then Y in 5th. But we haven't tested Y.

But note: we have to avoid T, C, R.

""MEANS"": letters M, E, A, N, S -> no T, C, R. S is a new letter.

""MEALY"": M, E, A, L, Y -> no T, C, R, L and Y are new.

""MEANY"": M, E, A, N, Y -> same.

But we also have to consider that the first guess had E as present but misplaced. In ""MEANS"", E is in 2nd, which is a new position. Similarly, in ""MEALY"", E is in 2nd.

But we don't have any information about S, L, Y, etc.

We can guess ""MEANS"" to test S.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We can try to guess the word if we are confident.

Alternatively, we can use this guess to test multiple possibilities.

But we know the word is ""MEAN?"" and we have to find the last letter.

We can list possible words:

- ""MEANS"": S at the end.
- ""MEALY"": L and Y.
- ""MEANY"": Y.
- ""MEANT"": T is out, so not.
- ""MEANS"" is the most common.

But we also have ""MEATY"", but T is out and also the pattern: M E A T Y -> but T is out and the 4th letter is T, which we know is not in the word? From the second guess, T is not in the word, so ""MEATY"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""MEARY"" is not a word.

""MEANS"" is a valid word.

But we don't know if S is in the word.

We can also consider ""MEDIA"" but that has D and I, and the pattern: M E D I A -> but we need A in 3rd and N in 4th. This doesn't fit.

Another one: ""MELON"" -> M E L O N -> but the 3rd letter is L, not A. So no.

We must have A in 3rd and N in 4th.

So, the word must be one of: ""MEANS"", ""MEALY"", ""MEANY"", etc.

But ""MEANT"" is out because T is not in the word.

We can also check ""MEANS"" because it's a common word.

But we have to be cautious: the feedback from the first guess said E is present but not in 5th, and now we have E in 2nd. So ""MEANS"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""MEALY"" is a candidate.

But we don't have any information about the 5th letter.

We can guess ""MEANS"" and if it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on S.

But we are on the third guess, so we can try.

Alternatively, we can use a guess that tests multiple options, but since the first three letters are fixed, we are only testing the last letter.

But we have to make a valid word.

Another idea: we can guess a word that has the same first four letters but a different last letter to test, but we are constrained by the pattern.

We can only change the last letter.

So, we have to guess one of the possibilities.

But we have multiple options: ""MEANS"", ""MEALY"", ""MEANY"", etc.

We can choose ""MEANS"" because it's the most common.

But let me see: we have not tested S, L, Y, etc.

We can also consider that the first guess had E as present, but we now know it's in 2nd, so that doesn't help.

We might also note that the word ""MEANS"" uses S, which is a common letter.

Similarly, ""MEALY"" uses L and Y.

But we don't have any information about L or Y.

So, I think we should guess ""MEANS"".

But wait, what if the word is ""MEANY""? Then we guess ""MEANS"" and get feedback that S is not in the word, then we can try ""MEANY"" next.

But we have to make a guess.

We can also think: if we guess ""MEANS"" and it's wrong, we get feedback on S. Then we can adjust.

But we have only 6 tries, so we can try to guess the word.

Alternatively, we can use a word that doesn't have E in 2nd? But we know E is in the word and must be in 1st or 2nd, but we are putting it in 2nd. If it's not there, then it must be in 1st.

But we are guessing to get the word.

I think ""MEANS"" is a good guess.

But let me check: in the first guess, we had E as present but misplaced. Now we know E is in 2nd. So the word is ""MEAN"" plus one more letter.

We can also consider ""MEATY"" but T is out.

Another word: ""MEADOW"" is 5 letters? M E A D O W -> but that's 5 letters? M, E, A, D, O, W -> but the pattern is M E A D O W, which doesn't have N in 4th. So no.

We must have N in 4th.

So, the only possibilities are words ending with S, L, Y, etc.

But we can also have ""MEANS"", ""MEALY"", ""MEANY"".

But ""MEANT"" is out.

We can also check ""MEGS"" but no N in 4th.

Another one: ""MELON"" doesn't fit.

So, I think the common ones are ""MEANS"", ""MEALY"", ""MEANY"".

We can try ""MEANS"" first.

But note: we have to avoid using letters that are already known to be absent. We know C, R, T are absent, so we avoid them.

In ""MEANS"", the last letter S is not ruled out.

Similarly, in ""MEALY"", L and Y are not ruled out.

But we have no information about L or Y.

We can also consider ""MEOID"" but no N in 4th.

I think we should guess ""MEANS"".

But let me see if there is a word that uses a letter we haven't tried to see if it's present.

But in this case, we are forced to have the first four letters fixed, so we can only change the last letter.

So, I'll go with ""MEANS"".

But wait, what if the word is ""MEANY""? Then we guess ""MEANS"" and get S wrong, then we try ""MEANY"" next.

But we have 4 more guesses, so it's okay.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has the same letters as ""MEANS"" but different last letter? But we can't because the last letter is the only unknown, and we are testing it.

We can guess ""MEALY"" to test L and Y.

But I think ""MEANS"" is a good guess.

So, our next guess: ""MEANS""

But let me confirm: the pattern is M E A N S.

If we guess ""MEANS"", and if it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on S.

But note: we know from the first guess that E is not in the 5th, and now we have E in 2nd, so that's fine.

Also, in ""MEANS"", the S is in 5th, which is a new position.

So, I think it's a good guess.

But we have to make sure that S is not ruled out. It isn't.

So, I'll go with ""MEANS"".

<guess>means</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(-)  
  - A is in the correct 3rd position.  
  - N is in the correct 4th position.  
  - E is in the word but not in the 5th position.  
  - C and R are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: meant** → Feedback: M(✓), E(✓), A(✓), N(✓), T(x)  
  - M is in the correct 1st position.  
  - E is in the correct 2nd position.  
  - A is confirmed in the 3rd position.  
  - N is confirmed in the 4th position.  
  - T is not in the word.  

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: **M E A N _** (positions 1–4 are confirmed as M, E, A, N).  
- The 5th position is unknown.  
- We know:  
  - E is in the word (from Guess 1) but is now confirmed in the 2nd position, so the previous feedback about E (being misplaced in Guess 1) is consistent.

  - **MEANS** (ends with S)

- If correct, we solve the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on S will confirm if it's in the word (and if so, its position) or absent, narrowing down to **MEALY** or **MEANY** for subsequent guesses.
