We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: ✓ (correct position)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The first letter is C. (because C is in the correct position)
 - The word contains R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". Specifically, R is not the second letter, and E is not the fifth letter.
 - The word does not contain A or N.

 Since the first letter is C, the word starts with C.

 We also know that R and E are in the word, but not in the positions we tried.

 Let's think about the positions:
 In ""crane"", the positions are:
  1: C (correct)
  2: R (wrong position, but present)
  3: A (absent)
  4: N (absent)
  5: E (wrong position, but present)

 Therefore, in the secret word:
 - Position 1: C
 - Position 2: cannot be R (because R is present but not in position 2), and must be one of the letters that are in the word or a new one, but note we know R is somewhere else.
 - Position 3: is not A, and not N (since N is absent). Also, we know A and N are not in the word at all.
 - Position 4: we don't know, but it's not N (absent) and not A (absent).
 - Position 5: cannot be E (because E is present but not in position 5), and not A or N.

 We must avoid using A and N in any position.

 Also, the word has R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.

 Since position 1 is C, let's denote the word as: C _ _ _ _

 We know R is in the word, but not in position 2. So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5? But wait, position 5 is currently occupied by E in our guess, but E is also misplaced. However, note that in the feedback, E is marked as present but not in position 5. So E cannot be in position 5? Actually, the feedback for E is that it is in the word but not in position 5. So E must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4? But we have to consider that the word has 5 letters.

 However, we also know that position 3 was A in our guess, but A is absent. So position 3 in the secret word is not A, and we don't know what it is.

 Similarly, position 4 was N, which is absent, so position 4 in the secret word is not N.

 Now, let's list the constraints:
 - Position 1: C
 - Position 2: cannot be R, and must be a letter that is not A, N, and also not C (since C is already in position 1) (but note C might appear again? However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but we don't have evidence of that yet). We'll assume no repetition for now until we have evidence.

 But note: the feedback for R is that it is present, so R appears at least once. Similarly for E.

 However, we must avoid A and N.

 So, for position 2, we can try to use a letter that is not R, and not A, N, and also not C? But wait, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. We should avoid using the same letter twice unless necessary? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

 Let's try to form a new word that:
 - Starts with C
 - Does not contain A or N
 - Contains R and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively? Actually, R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5. But they can be in other positions.)

 Also, we have to consider that R and E must be placed in positions 3, 4, or 5? But note: position 5 is the last letter, and we know E is not in position 5, so E must be in 2, 3, or 4? However, we have position 3 open? But we don't know what goes there.

 We can try to use a word that has R in position 3 or 4, and E in position 2 or 4? But we have to avoid A and N.

 Let me think of words that start with C and contain R and E, without A or N.

 Some possibilities: 
 - ""CREPT"": but we have E in position 3? And we know E cannot be in position 5? But in this word, E is in position 3? But wait, we don't know if E can be in position 3. However, we must avoid using A and N.

 But note: we also have to consider that R is in the word and not in position 2. In ""CREPT"", R is in position 3? And E is in position 3? That's okay because E can be in position 3.

 However, we have to check the positions: 
 In ""CREPT"": 
   C (position 1) -> we know it's correct, so we can use it to test other letters.
   R (position 2) -> but wait, in our feedback, R was in position 2 in the guess and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So if we put R in position 2 again, we know it will be wrong? But we can try to avoid that.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in a different position, say position 4 or 5.

 But note: we also have E to place. E cannot be in position 5, so in ""CREPT"", E is in position 3? That's acceptable.

 However, we must avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it's wrong? But we don't have any other constraints.

 But let me check: we know R is not in position 2, so if we put R in position 2 again, we will get a '-' again? Actually, we can, but it doesn't give us new information. So we should try R in a new position.

 Similarly, E cannot be in position 5, so we can put E in position 2, 3, or 4.

 Let me try to form a word that has R in position 3 or 4, and E in position 2 or 4? But we have to avoid A and N.

 Example: 
 - ""CRESS"": but it has two S's? And E is in position 3? But we don't know if E can be in position 3. Also, we have S and S again? We don't know about S.

 But note: we don't have any information about S. It might be present or absent.

 However, we must avoid A and N. So ""CRESS"" is acceptable? But let's break it down:

 But wait, we have to use a word that is 5 letters and valid. However, we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRUEL"". But that has U and L? And E in position 4? 

 But note: we don't know about U and L.

 However, we have to avoid A and N. So ""CRUEL"" is acceptable.

 But let me see: 
 In ""CRUEL"": 
   C (position 1) -> correct
   R (position 2) -> but we know R is not in position 2? Actually, we know that in the secret word, R is not in position 2. But in our new guess, we are putting R in position 2 again. We know it will be marked as '-' again? So that doesn't give us new information about R. We should try to put R in a new position to see if it fits.

 We want to test R in a position that might be correct. So we can try R in position 3 or 4.

 Similarly, we want to test E in a position that might be correct. Since E cannot be in position 5, we can try it in position 2, 3, or 4.

 Let me try to form a word that has R in position 3 and E in position 4? For example: ""C_R_E_"" but we need a word that starts with C, then a letter that is not R (for position 2), then E, then two more letters.

 Example: ""CURE?"" but we need 5 letters. ""CURE"" is 4. So we need 5: ""CURED""? But that ends with D. Or ""CURED"" is 5 letters? Actually, ""CURED"" is 5 letters: C-U-R-E-D.

 But let's check: 
   C (1) -> correct
   U (2) -> new letter, we don't know about it.
   R (3) -> we are testing R in position 3 (which is a new position for R, so if it's correct we get a check, if not we get a '-' or 'x')
   E (4) -> we are testing E in position 4 (which is a new position for E, since in the first guess E was at position 5)
   D (5) -> new letter.

 Also, we avoid A and N.

 But note: we are using U and D, which are new.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRUEL"" as I thought earlier: C-R-U-E-L.

 But that puts R in position 2 again, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

 Another idea: ""CREPT"" -> C-R-E-P-T. But again, R is in position 2 and we know that's wrong? So we avoid.

 How about ""CROWD""? But we don't have E. We must include E because we know it's in the word.

 So we need a word that has E.

 Let me try ""CREST"": but it has two E's? And E is in position 3 and 5? But we know E cannot be in position 5? So if we put E in position 5, we know it will be marked as absent? But wait, the feedback for E in the first guess was that it is present but not in position 5. So if we put E in position 5 again, we know it will be '-' again? Actually, we can, but it doesn't help us find the correct position.

 We want to test E in a new position. So we can put E in position 2, 3, or 4.

 Similarly, R must be in position 3, 4, or 5? But note: we have position 5 available? But we know E cannot be in position 5, so R can be in position 5? Yes, because the feedback for E was that it is present but not in position 5, so position 5 could be R? Yes.

 So let me try to form a word with R in position 5? And E in position 2 or 3 or 4.

 Example: ""CRESS"" is 5 letters: C-R-E-S-S. But we have two S's? And we don't know about S. Also, E is in position 3? And we know E cannot be in position 5, but position 3 is allowed? Yes.

 But we have two S's? That might not be efficient.

 Another word: ""CREPT"" is not good because R is in position 2.

 How about ""CRUEL"": C-R-U-E-L -> R in position 2 again.

 How about ""CABLE""? But we know A is absent, so we cannot use A.

 How about ""CEDED""? But that has two E's? And we don't know about D. Also, E is in position 2 and 4? But we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? The feedback only told us one E is present? Actually, the feedback for the first guess only showed one E as present. But it could be that there are two E's? The feedback doesn't tell us the frequency. So it's possible.

 However, we have to avoid A and N. ""CEDED"" has E and D. But we don't know about D.

 But note: we are trying to get information about the remaining letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRUEL"" but that puts R in position 2 again.

 How about ""CURED"": C-U-R-E-D -> 
   Positions: 
     1: C (correct)
     2: U (new)
     3: R (we are testing R in position 3)
     4: E (we are testing E in position 4)
     5: D (new)

 This avoids A and N, and we test R in position 3 and E in position 4.

 Also, we test U and D.

 But note: we are using U and D, which are not the most common. But we have to try.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRESS"": 
   C (1) -> correct
   R (2) -> we know it's wrong, so we avoid? Actually, we know R is not in position 2, so if we put R in position 2 again, we get a '-' again. So we don't learn anything new about R? Actually, we already know R is not in position 2, so if we put R in position 2 again, we can only learn about the position if we get a '-' again? But we already know it's not there. So it's a waste of a position? We should avoid.

 So we want to test R in a new position. In ""CURED"", R is in position 3 (which is new) and E in position 4 (which is new for E? Actually, in the first guess E was at position 5, now we put it at 4. That's good.

 But wait, we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any evidence, so we avoid duplicates for now.

 Another word: ""CREME""? But that has two E's? And we don't know about M.

 How about ""CREST"": 
   C (1) -> correct
   R (2) -> we know it's not position 2, so we avoid? Actually, we know R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we get a '-' again. So we don't learn the position of R.

 We want to test R in a position that might be correct. So we can try position 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, we want to test E in a position that is not 5.

 Let me try to find a word that has R in position 3 and E in position 2? For example: ""CREPT"" -> but that has R in position 2? Actually, ""CREPT"" is C-R-E-P-T -> R in position 2.

 How about ""CREPT"": same as above.

 How about ""CREME"": C-R-E-M-E -> but that has two E's? And R in position 2.

 We are having trouble avoiding R in position 2.

 Let me think of words that start with C, have R in position 3 or 4, and E in position 2 or 3 or 4.

 Example: ""C_R_E_"" -> but we need a word that doesn't put R in position 2.

 How about ""CUBER""? But that doesn't have R? We must include R.

 How about ""CRUEL"": C-R-U-E-L -> R in position 2 again.

 How about ""CREDO"": C-R-E-D-O -> R in position 2 again.

 How about ""CREPE"": C-R-E-P-E -> R in position 2 again, and two E's.

 We are stuck with R in position 2.

 Alternatively, we can try R in position 4. For example: ""CURED"" (which we thought of) or ""CRIED"": but that has I and D? And E in position 4? But ""CRIED"" has R in position 1? But position 1 is C, so that doesn't work.

 We need a word that starts with C, and then has R in position 3, 4, or 5, and E in position 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

 Let me try: ""CURED"" (C-U-R-E-D) -> R in position 3, E in position 4.

 But we don't know about U and D.

 Another word: ""CRESS"" is not good because R is in position 2.

 How about ""CREWS"": C-R-E-W-S -> R in position 2 again.

 How about ""CERES"": C-E-R-E-S -> 
   Position 1: C
   Position 2: E (we are testing E in position 2)
   Position 3: R (testing R in position 3)
   Position 4: E (testing E in position 4)
   Position 5: S

 This word: 
   - Starts with C
   - Has E in position 2 and 4? But we don't know if the word has two E's? The feedback from the first guess only told us one E is present. But it could have two? The feedback doesn't tell us the frequency. So it's possible.

 But we are using two E's. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. If it doesn't, then one of the E's might be marked as absent? Actually, the feedback will mark the first E (if in position 2) and the second E (in position 4) if the word has two E's? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CURED"": C-U-R-E-D -> 
   Position 1: C (correct)
   Position 2: U (new)
   Position 3: R (new position for R, we test R in position 3)
   Position 4: E (we test E in position 4)
   Position 5: D (new)

 This tests R in position 3 and E in position 4, and we avoid A and N.

 Also, we test U and D.

 Another common word: ""CREPT"" is not good because R is in position 2.

 How about ""CREPT"" is not good.

 How about ""CRUEL"": same as above.

 Or ""CREEK"": but that has two E's and K? And R in position 2.

 We are having trouble avoiding R in position 2.

 Let me try to put R in position 5: for example, ""CURED"" (which we thought of) or ""CIVIC"" -> but that doesn't have E? We need E.

 How about ""CRIED"": but that starts with C-R-I-E-D -> R in position 2 again.

 How about ""CRORE"": but that has two R's? And we don't know about O and L. Also, R is in position 2? Again.

 We need to avoid R in position 2.

 How about ""CABLE"": but we know A is absent, so no.

 How about ""CEDAR"": but we know A is absent, so no.

 How about ""CURED"": I think ""CURED"" is a valid word and it works.

 But let me confirm: 
   CURED: C-U-R-E-D

 We know:
   Position 1: C -> correct.
   Position 2: U -> new letter, we don't know about it.
   Position 3: R -> we are testing R in position 3.
   Position 4: E -> testing E in position 4.
   Position 5: D -> new letter.

 We avoid A and N.

 So this is a good candidate.

 But note: we are using two vowels? And we already know E is in the word, but we are testing U and D.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRIED"": but that has R in position 2? No, ""CRIED"" is C-R-I-E-D -> R in position 2, which we want to avoid.

 Another word: ""CROME""? But that has O and M? And E in position 4? But ""CROME"" is not a common word? Actually, it might be. But let's see: we need a valid English word.

 Actually, ""CROME"" is not a valid word? I think ""choke"" is more common.

 How about ""CHORE"": but that starts with C-H-O-R-E -> but we know the first letter is C, so that doesn't work.

 We must start with C.

 How about ""CARET"": but we know A is absent, so no.

 How about ""CURED"" is a valid word.

 Another option: ""CUBER"" -> but that doesn't have R? We must have R.

 How about ""CURED"" is the best so far.

 But wait, we have to consider that the word might have R in position 3 and E in position 4? That's what ""CURED"" does.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRESS"" but that has R in position 2.

 How about ""CREPT"": we already considered and it has R in position 2.

 I think ""CURED"" is a good choice.

 But let me check if there is a word that tests more common letters. We want to test letters that are more likely to be in the word.

 We know the word has R and E, and we have C fixed. The other letters are unknown.

 We haven't tested many consonants. We can try to include other common consonants like T, L, S, etc.

 How about ""CURED"" uses U and D. U is a vowel, D is a consonant.

 Another word: ""CRIED"" is not good because R is in position 2.

 How about ""CROME""? I'm not sure if it's valid. Let me think: ""chrome"" is not a standard word.

 How about ""CHOKE"": but that doesn't have E? We need E.

 How about ""CUTIE"": but that has U, T, I, E? And R? No, no R.

 We must include R.

 How about ""CURED"" is acceptable.

 But note: we are testing R in position 3 and E in position 4. Also, we test U and D.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CURED"" as the next guess.

 But wait, what about ""CREPT""? It's not because R is in position 2.

 Another word: ""CRORE"" -> R in position 2? No.

 How about ""CROME""? I think it's not valid.

 Let me search for words: 
   ""CURED"" is one.
   ""CRIED"" is not because R is in position 2.
   ""CREPT"" is not because R is in position 2.
   ""CROWD"" is not because we don't have E.

 How about ""CREME"": C-R-E-M-E -> 
   Position 1: C
   Position 2: R -> we know R is not in position 2, so we avoid? Actually, we know R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we get a '-' again. So we don't learn about R's position.

 We want to test R in a new position. So we can try position 3 or 4.

 How about ""CREST"": same as above.

 How about ""CRESS"": same.

 I think ""CURED"" is a valid option.

 But let me see if there is a word that tests T, L, S, which are common.

 How about ""CURED"" doesn't test T or L.

 How about ""CREPT"" doesn't test T or L.

 How about ""CROME""? Not valid.

 How about ""CUTIE"" -> no R.

 We must have R.

 Another word: ""CURED"" is the best we have.

 But note: we are using two vowels (U and E) and we already know E is present. We need to test more consonants.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CURED"" and then if we get feedback, we might learn more.

 But let me see: 
   If the secret word has R in position 3 and E in position 4, then ""CURED"" would get:
      C: ✓
      U: ? 
      R: ✓ (if position 3 is correct) or - (if R is in position 4 or 5, but we are testing position 3)
      E: ✓ (if position 4 is correct) or - (if E is in position 2 or 3)
      D: ?

   But we are testing R in position 3 and E in position 4. If we get a ✓ for R and a ✓ for E, then we have the word? But we don't know the other letters.

   However, we are only getting closer to the solution.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put R in position 2 and doesn't put E in position 5, and tests more letters.

 Another idea: ""CUTIE"" doesn't have R.

 How about ""CRUEL"": C-R-U-E-L -> same as before.

 How about ""CURED"": C-U-R-E-D

 This is a valid word.

 But note: we are testing R in position 3 and E in position 4. Also, we test U and D.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CROME"": not valid.

 Or ""CRORE"": not because R is in position 2.

 How about ""CREEK"": C-R-E-E-K -> 
   Position 1: C
   Position 2: R -> we know that's wrong, so we avoid? Actually, we know R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we get a '-' again. So we don't learn about R's position.

 We want to test R in a new position. So we can try position 4.

 How about ""CURED"" is the only one I can think of.

 Another word: ""CURED"" is the only one I can think of.

 But wait, there is ""CRIED"": but that has R in position 2.

 How about ""CREPT"": C-R-E-P-T -> R in position 2.

 I think we are stuck with R in position 2? But we know it's not. So we must avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, we can only test R in position 3 or 4 or 5.

 Position 5: we haven't tested R there.

 How about ""CURED"" (C-U-R-E-D) -> R in position 3, E in position 4.

 That's good.

 But note: we are testing E in position 4. If the secret word has E in position 4, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-'.

 Similarly, R in position 3: if it's correct, we get a ✓, if not, we get a '-'.

 We also test U and D.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CUTIE"" -> no R.

 Another word: ""CREPE"" -> R in position 2.

 I think ""CURED"" is acceptable.

 But let me check: is there a word ""CURED"" is the 5th letter? No, it's the 5th letter? Actually, ""CURED"" is 5 letters: C-U-R-E-D.

 So we can use that.

 But note: we are using two vowels (U and E) and we already know E is present. We are testing U and D.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CROME"" but it's not valid.

 How about ""CURED"" is the only common word I can think of.

 So I'll go with ""CURED"".

 But wait, what about ""CRIED""? It has R in position 2, which we know is wrong. So we avoid.

 Another word: ""CROME"" is not valid.

 How about ""CREDO"": C-R-E-D-O -> 
   Position 1: C
   Position 2: R -> we know R is not in position 2, so we avoid? Actually, we know R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we get a '-' again. So we don't learn about R's position.

 We want to test R in a new position. So we can try position 3 or 4.

 How about ""CREPT"": same.

 How about ""CURED"" is the only one.

 So I'll go with ""CURED"".

 But note: we are testing R in position 3 and E in position 4. If we get a ✓ for R and a ✓ for E, then we have the word? But we don't know the last letter.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that ends with a letter that we haven't tried, so that we can test more letters.

 We have only tested: C, R, A, N, E (and A and N are absent). So we have 21 letters left to test? Actually, we have 26 letters minus 5 we tested? But we haven't tested many.

 We can try to test more common letters. For example, we haven't tested T, L, S, D, U, etc.

 ""CURED"" tests U and D.

 Another word: ""CUTIE"" doesn't have R.

 How about ""CURED"" is the only one.

 So I'll guess ""CURED"".

 But wait, what about ""CROME""? I'm not sure. Let me think: ""chrome"" is not a valid English word.

 How about ""CRIED"": but that has R in position 2.

 I think we have to go with ""CURED"".

 So the next guess is ""CURED"".

 But note: we are not forced to use R in this guess? Actually, we are: because we know R is in the word, and we haven't found its position. So we should include R.

 Therefore, I choose ""CURED"".

<guess>cured</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- **R** is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- **A** is absent (x).
- **N** is absent (x).
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Key deductions:
1. The secret word starts with **C**.
2. **R** must be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is invalid).
3. **E** must be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is invalid).
4. **A** and **N** are eliminated.

For the next guess, I prioritize:
- Testing **R** in a new position (not position 2).
- Testing **E** in a new position (not position 5).
- Avoiding **A** and **N**.
- Introducing new common letters (e.g., **U**, **D**).

**CURED** fits these criteria:
- Starts with **C** (position 1 correct).
- **U** (position 2): new letter, tests a common vowel.
- **R** (position 3): tests R in a new position (position 3).
- **E** (position 4): tests E in a new position (position 4).
- **D** (position 5): new consonant.

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while leveraging the known constraints.

<guess>cured</guess>",cured,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: ✓ (correct position)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The first letter is C. (because C is in the correct position)
 - The word contains R and E, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". Specifically, R is not the second letter, and E is not the fifth letter.
 - The word does not contain A or N.

 Since the first letter is C, the word starts with C.

 We also know that R and E are in the word, but not in the positions we tried.

 Let's think about the positions:
 In ""crane"", the positions are:
  1: C (correct)
  2: R (wrong position, but present)
  3: A (absent)
  4: N (absent)
  5: E (wrong position, but present)

 Therefore, in the secret word:
 - Position 1: C
 - Position 2: cannot be R (because R is present but not in position 2), and must be one of the letters that are in the word or a new one, but note we know R is somewhere else.
 - Position 3: is not A, and not N (since N is absent). Also, we know A and N are not in the word at all.
 - Position 4: we don't know, but it's not N (absent) and not A (absent).
 - Position 5: cannot be E (because E is present but not in position 5), and not A or N.

 We must avoid using A and N in any position.

 Also, the word has R and E, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.

 Since position 1 is C, let's denote the word as: C _ _ _ _

 We know R is in the word, but not in position 2. So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5? But wait, position 5 is currently occupied by E in our guess, but E is also misplaced. However, note that in the feedback, E is marked as present but not in position 5. So E cannot be in position 5? Actually, the feedback for E is that it is in the word but not in position 5. So E must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4? But we have to consider that the word has 5 letters.

 However, we also know that position 3 was A in our guess, but A is absent. So position 3 in the secret word is not A, and we don't know what it is.

 Similarly, position 4 was N, which is absent, so position 4 in the secret word is not N.

 Now, let's list the constraints:
 - Position 1: C
 - Position 2: cannot be R, and must be a letter that is not A, N, and also not C (since C is already in position 1) (but note C might appear again? However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but we don't have evidence of that yet). We'll assume no repetition for now until we have evidence.

 But note: the feedback for R is that it is present, so R appears at least once. Similarly for E.

 However, we must avoid A and N.

 So, for position 2, we can try to use a letter that is not R, and not A, N, and also not C? But wait, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. We should avoid using the same letter twice unless necessary? But we don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

 Let's try to form a new word that:
 - Starts with C
 - Does not contain A or N
 - Contains R and E (but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively? Actually, R cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5. But they can be in other positions.)

 Also, we have to consider that R and E must be placed in positions 3, 4, or 5? But note: position 5 is the last letter, and we know E is not in position 5, so E must be in 2, 3, or 4? However, we have position 3 open? But we don't know what goes there.

 We can try to use a word that has R in position 3 or 4, and E in position 2 or 4? But we have to avoid A and N.

 Let me think of words that start with C and contain R and E, without A or N.

 Some possibilities: 
 - ""CREPT"": but we have E in position 3? And we know E cannot be in position 5? But in this word, E is in position 3? But wait, we don't know if E can be in position 3. However, we must avoid using A and N.

 But note: we also have to consider that R is in the word and not in position 2. In ""CREPT"", R is in position 3? And E is in position 3? That's okay because E can be in position 3.

 However, we have to check the positions: 
 In ""CREPT"": 
   C (position 1) -> we know it's correct, so we can use it to test other letters.
   R (position 2) -> but wait, in our feedback, R was in position 2 in the guess and we got a '-' meaning it is in the word but not in that position. So if we put R in position 2 again, we know it will be wrong? But we can try to avoid that.

 Alternatively, we can try to put R in a different position, say position 4 or 5.

 But note: we also have E to place. E cannot be in position 5, so in ""CREPT"", E is in position 3? That's acceptable.

 However, we must avoid using the same letter in the same position if we know it's wrong? But we don't have any other constraints.

 But let me check: we know R is not in position 2, so if we put R in position 2 again, we will get a '-' again? Actually, we can, but it doesn't give us new information. So we should try R in a new position.

 Similarly, E cannot be in position 5, so we can put E in position 2, 3, or 4.

 Let me try to form a word that has R in position 3 or 4, and E in position 2 or 4? But we have to avoid A and N.

 Example: 
 - ""CRESS"": but it has two S's? And E is in position 3? But we don't know if E can be in position 3. Also, we have S and S again? We don't know about S.

 But note: we don't have any information about S. It might be present or absent.

 However, we must avoid A and N. So ""CRESS"" is acceptable? But let's break it down:

 But wait, we have to use a word that is 5 letters and valid. However, we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRUEL"". But that has U and L? And E in position 4? 

 But note: we don't know about U and L.

 However, we have to avoid A and N. So ""CRUEL"" is acceptable.

 But let me see: 
 In ""CRUEL"": 
   C (position 1) -> correct
   R (position 2) -> but we know R is not in position 2? Actually, we know that in the secret word, R is not in position 2. But in our new guess, we are putting R in position 2 again. We know it will be marked as '-' again? So that doesn't give us new information about R. We should try to put R in a new position to see if it fits.

 We want to test R in a position that might be correct. So we can try R in position 3 or 4.

 Similarly, we want to test E in a position that might be correct. Since E cannot be in position 5, we can try it in position 2, 3, or 4.

 Let me try to form a word that has R in position 3 and E in position 4? For example: ""C_R_E_"" but we need a word that starts with C, then a letter that is not R (for position 2), then E, then two more letters.

 Example: ""CURE?"" but we need 5 letters. ""CURE"" is 4. So we need 5: ""CURED""? But that ends with D. Or ""CURED"" is 5 letters? Actually, ""CURED"" is 5 letters: C-U-R-E-D.

 But let's check: 
   C (1) -> correct
   U (2) -> new letter, we don't know about it.
   R (3) -> we are testing R in position 3 (which is a new position for R, so if it's correct we get a check, if not we get a '-' or 'x')
   E (4) -> we are testing E in position 4 (which is a new position for E, since in the first guess E was at position 5)
   D (5) -> new letter.

 Also, we avoid A and N.

 But note: we are using U and D, which are new.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRUEL"" as I thought earlier: C-R-U-E-L.

 But that puts R in position 2 again, which we know is wrong. So we avoid that.

 Another idea: ""CREPT"" -> C-R-E-P-T. But again, R is in position 2 and we know that's wrong? So we avoid.

 How about ""CROWD""? But we don't have E. We must include E because we know it's in the word.

 So we need a word that has E.

 Let me try ""CREST"": but it has two E's? And E is in position 3 and 5? But we know E cannot be in position 5? So if we put E in position 5, we know it will be marked as absent? But wait, the feedback for E in the first guess was that it is present but not in position 5. So if we put E in position 5 again, we know it will be '-' again? Actually, we can, but it doesn't help us find the correct position.

 We want to test E in a new position. So we can put E in position 2, 3, or 4.

 Similarly, R must be in position 3, 4, or 5? But note: we have position 5 available? But we know E cannot be in position 5, so R can be in position 5? Yes, because the feedback for E was that it is present but not in position 5, so position 5 could be R? Yes.

 So let me try to form a word with R in position 5? And E in position 2 or 3 or 4.

 Example: ""CRESS"" is 5 letters: C-R-E-S-S. But we have two S's? And we don't know about S. Also, E is in position 3? And we know E cannot be in position 5, but position 3 is allowed? Yes.

 But we have two S's? That might not be efficient.

 Another word: ""CREPT"" is not good because R is in position 2.

 How about ""CRUEL"": C-R-U-E-L -> R in position 2 again.

 How about ""CABLE""? But we know A is absent, so we cannot use A.

 How about ""CEDED""? But that has two E's? And we don't know about D. Also, E is in position 2 and 4? But we know E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? The feedback only told us one E is present? Actually, the feedback for the first guess only showed one E as present. But it could be that there are two E's? The feedback doesn't tell us the frequency. So it's possible.

 However, we have to avoid A and N. ""CEDED"" has E and D. But we don't know about D.

 But note: we are trying to get information about the remaining letters.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRUEL"" but that puts R in position 2 again.

 How about ""CURED"": C-U-R-E-D -> 
   Positions: 
     1: C (correct)
     2: U (new)
     3: R (we are testing R in position 3)
     4: E (we are testing E in position 4)
     5: D (new)

 This avoids A and N, and we test R in position 3 and E in position 4.

 Also, we test U and D.

 But note: we are using U and D, which are not the most common. But we have to try.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRESS"": 
   C (1) -> correct
   R (2) -> we know it's wrong, so we avoid? Actually, we know R is not in position 2, so if we put R in position 2 again, we get a '-' again. So we don't learn anything new about R? Actually, we already know R is not in position 2, so if we put R in position 2 again, we can only learn about the position if we get a '-' again? But we already know it's not there. So it's a waste of a position? We should avoid.

 So we want to test R in a new position. In ""CURED"", R is in position 3 (which is new) and E in position 4 (which is new for E? Actually, in the first guess E was at position 5, now we put it at 4. That's good.

 But wait, we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any evidence, so we avoid duplicates for now.

 Another word: ""CREME""? But that has two E's? And we don't know about M.

 How about ""CREST"": 
   C (1) -> correct
   R (2) -> we know it's not position 2, so we avoid? Actually, we know R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we get a '-' again. So we don't learn the position of R.

 We want to test R in a position that might be correct. So we can try position 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, we want to test E in a position that is not 5.

 Let me try to find a word that has R in position 3 and E in position 2? For example: ""CREPT"" -> but that has R in position 2? Actually, ""CREPT"" is C-R-E-P-T -> R in position 2.

 How about ""CREPT"": same as above.

 How about ""CREME"": C-R-E-M-E -> but that has two E's? And R in position 2.

 We are having trouble avoiding R in position 2.

 Let me think of words that start with C, have R in position 3 or 4, and E in position 2 or 3 or 4.

 Example: ""C_R_E_"" -> but we need a word that doesn't put R in position 2.

 How about ""CUBER""? But that doesn't have R? We must include R.

 How about ""CRUEL"": C-R-U-E-L -> R in position 2 again.

 How about ""CREDO"": C-R-E-D-O -> R in position 2 again.

 How about ""CREPE"": C-R-E-P-E -> R in position 2 again, and two E's.

 We are stuck with R in position 2.

 Alternatively, we can try R in position 4. For example: ""CURED"" (which we thought of) or ""CRIED"": but that has I and D? And E in position 4? But ""CRIED"" has R in position 1? But position 1 is C, so that doesn't work.

 We need a word that starts with C, and then has R in position 3, 4, or 5, and E in position 2, 3, or 4 (but not 5).

 Let me try: ""CURED"" (C-U-R-E-D) -> R in position 3, E in position 4.

 But we don't know about U and D.

 Another word: ""CRESS"" is not good because R is in position 2.

 How about ""CREWS"": C-R-E-W-S -> R in position 2 again.

 How about ""CERES"": C-E-R-E-S -> 
   Position 1: C
   Position 2: E (we are testing E in position 2)
   Position 3: R (testing R in position 3)
   Position 4: E (testing E in position 4)
   Position 5: S

 This word: 
   - Starts with C
   - Has E in position 2 and 4? But we don't know if the word has two E's? The feedback from the first guess only told us one E is present. But it could have two? The feedback doesn't tell us the frequency. So it's possible.

 But we are using two E's. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. If it doesn't, then one of the E's might be marked as absent? Actually, the feedback will mark the first E (if in position 2) and the second E (in position 4) if the word has two E's? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CURED"": C-U-R-E-D -> 
   Position 1: C (correct)
   Position 2: U (new)
   Position 3: R (new position for R, we test R in position 3)
   Position 4: E (we test E in position 4)
   Position 5: D (new)

 This tests R in position 3 and E in position 4, and we avoid A and N.

 Also, we test U and D.

 Another common word: ""CREPT"" is not good because R is in position 2.

 How about ""CREPT"" is not good.

 How about ""CRUEL"": same as above.

 Or ""CREEK"": but that has two E's and K? And R in position 2.

 We are having trouble avoiding R in position 2.

 Let me try to put R in position 5: for example, ""CURED"" (which we thought of) or ""CIVIC"" -> but that doesn't have E? We need E.

 How about ""CRIED"": but that starts with C-R-I-E-D -> R in position 2 again.

 How about ""CRORE"": but that has two R's? And we don't know about O and L. Also, R is in position 2? Again.

 We need to avoid R in position 2.

 How about ""CABLE"": but we know A is absent, so no.

 How about ""CEDAR"": but we know A is absent, so no.

 How about ""CURED"": I think ""CURED"" is a valid word and it works.

 But let me confirm: 
   CURED: C-U-R-E-D

 We know:
   Position 1: C -> correct.
   Position 2: U -> new letter, we don't know about it.
   Position 3: R -> we are testing R in position 3.
   Position 4: E -> testing E in position 4.
   Position 5: D -> new letter.

 We avoid A and N.

 So this is a good candidate.

 But note: we are using two vowels? And we already know E is in the word, but we are testing U and D.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRIED"": but that has R in position 2? No, ""CRIED"" is C-R-I-E-D -> R in position 2, which we want to avoid.

 Another word: ""CROME""? But that has O and M? And E in position 4? But ""CROME"" is not a common word? Actually, it might be. But let's see: we need a valid English word.

 Actually, ""CROME"" is not a valid word? I think ""choke"" is more common.

 How about ""CHORE"": but that starts with C-H-O-R-E -> but we know the first letter is C, so that doesn't work.

 We must start with C.

 How about ""CARET"": but we know A is absent, so no.

 How about ""CURED"" is a valid word.

 Another option: ""CUBER"" -> but that doesn't have R? We must have R.

 How about ""CURED"" is the best so far.

 But wait, we have to consider that the word might have R in position 3 and E in position 4? That's what ""CURED"" does.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRESS"" but that has R in position 2.

 How about ""CREPT"": we already considered and it has R in position 2.

 I think ""CURED"" is a good choice.

 But let me check if there is a word that tests more common letters. We want to test letters that are more likely to be in the word.

 We know the word has R and E, and we have C fixed. The other letters are unknown.

 We haven't tested many consonants. We can try to include other common consonants like T, L, S, etc.

 How about ""CURED"" uses U and D. U is a vowel, D is a consonant.

 Another word: ""CRIED"" is not good because R is in position 2.

 How about ""CROME""? I'm not sure if it's valid. Let me think: ""chrome"" is not a standard word.

 How about ""CHOKE"": but that doesn't have E? We need E.

 How about ""CUTIE"": but that has U, T, I, E? And R? No, no R.

 We must include R.

 How about ""CURED"" is acceptable.

 But note: we are testing R in position 3 and E in position 4. Also, we test U and D.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CURED"" as the next guess.

 But wait, what about ""CREPT""? It's not because R is in position 2.

 Another word: ""CRORE"" -> R in position 2? No.

 How about ""CROME""? I think it's not valid.

 Let me search for words: 
   ""CURED"" is one.
   ""CRIED"" is not because R is in position 2.
   ""CREPT"" is not because R is in position 2.
   ""CROWD"" is not because we don't have E.

 How about ""CREME"": C-R-E-M-E -> 
   Position 1: C
   Position 2: R -> we know R is not in position 2, so we avoid? Actually, we know R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we get a '-' again. So we don't learn about R's position.

 We want to test R in a new position. So we can try position 3 or 4.

 How about ""CREST"": same as above.

 How about ""CRESS"": same.

 I think ""CURED"" is a valid option.

 But let me see if there is a word that tests T, L, S, which are common.

 How about ""CURED"" doesn't test T or L.

 How about ""CREPT"" doesn't test T or L.

 How about ""CROME""? Not valid.

 How about ""CUTIE"" -> no R.

 We must have R.

 Another word: ""CURED"" is the best we have.

 But note: we are using two vowels (U and E) and we already know E is present. We need to test more consonants.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CURED"" and then if we get feedback, we might learn more.

 But let me see: 
   If the secret word has R in position 3 and E in position 4, then ""CURED"" would get:
      C: ✓
      U: ? 
      R: ✓ (if position 3 is correct) or - (if R is in position 4 or 5, but we are testing position 3)
      E: ✓ (if position 4 is correct) or - (if E is in position 2 or 3)
      D: ?

   But we are testing R in position 3 and E in position 4. If we get a ✓ for R and a ✓ for E, then we have the word? But we don't know the other letters.

   However, we are only getting closer to the solution.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put R in position 2 and doesn't put E in position 5, and tests more letters.

 Another idea: ""CUTIE"" doesn't have R.

 How about ""CRUEL"": C-R-U-E-L -> same as before.

 How about ""CURED"": C-U-R-E-D

 This is a valid word.

 But note: we are testing R in position 3 and E in position 4. Also, we test U and D.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CROME"": not valid.

 Or ""CRORE"": not because R is in position 2.

 How about ""CREEK"": C-R-E-E-K -> 
   Position 1: C
   Position 2: R -> we know that's wrong, so we avoid? Actually, we know R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we get a '-' again. So we don't learn about R's position.

 We want to test R in a new position. So we can try position 4.

 How about ""CURED"" is the only one I can think of.

 Another word: ""CURED"" is the only one I can think of.

 But wait, there is ""CRIED"": but that has R in position 2.

 How about ""CREPT"": C-R-E-P-T -> R in position 2.

 I think we are stuck with R in position 2? But we know it's not. So we must avoid position 2 for R.

 Therefore, we can only test R in position 3 or 4 or 5.

 Position 5: we haven't tested R there.

 How about ""CURED"" (C-U-R-E-D) -> R in position 3, E in position 4.

 That's good.

 But note: we are testing E in position 4. If the secret word has E in position 4, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-'.

 Similarly, R in position 3: if it's correct, we get a ✓, if not, we get a '-'.

 We also test U and D.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CUTIE"" -> no R.

 Another word: ""CREPE"" -> R in position 2.

 I think ""CURED"" is acceptable.

 But let me check: is there a word ""CURED"" is the 5th letter? No, it's the 5th letter? Actually, ""CURED"" is 5 letters: C-U-R-E-D.

 So we can use that.

 But note: we are using two vowels (U and E) and we already know E is present. We are testing U and D.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CROME"" but it's not valid.

 How about ""CURED"" is the only common word I can think of.

 So I'll go with ""CURED"".

 But wait, what about ""CRIED""? It has R in position 2, which we know is wrong. So we avoid.

 Another word: ""CROME"" is not valid.

 How about ""CREDO"": C-R-E-D-O -> 
   Position 1: C
   Position 2: R -> we know R is not in position 2, so we avoid? Actually, we know R is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put R in position 2 again, we get a '-' again. So we don't learn about R's position.

 We want to test R in a new position. So we can try position 3 or 4.

 How about ""CREPT"": same.

 How about ""CURED"" is the only one.

 So I'll go with ""CURED"".

 But note: we are testing R in position 3 and E in position 4. If we get a ✓ for R and a ✓ for E, then we have the word? But we don't know the last letter.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that ends with a letter that we haven't tried, so that we can test more letters.

 We have only tested: C, R, A, N, E (and A and N are absent). So we have 21 letters left to test? Actually, we have 26 letters minus 5 we tested? But we haven't tested many.

 We can try to test more common letters. For example, we haven't tested T, L, S, D, U, etc.

 ""CURED"" tests U and D.

 Another word: ""CUTIE"" doesn't have R.

 How about ""CURED"" is the only one.

 So I'll guess ""CURED"".

 But wait, what about ""CROME""? I'm not sure. Let me think: ""chrome"" is not a valid English word.

 How about ""CRIED"": but that has R in position 2.

 I think we have to go with ""CURED"".

 So the next guess is ""CURED"".

 But note: we are not forced to use R in this guess? Actually, we are: because we know R is in the word, and we haven't found its position. So we should include R.

 Therefore, I choose ""CURED"".

<guess>cured</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- **R** is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- **A** is absent (x).
- **N** is absent (x).
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Key deductions:
1. The secret word starts with **C**.
2. **R** must be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (since position 2 is invalid).
3. **E** must be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since position 5 is invalid).
4. **A** and **N** are eliminated.

For the next guess, I prioritize:
- Testing **R** in a new position (not position 2).
- Testing **E** in a new position (not position 5).
- Avoiding **A** and **N**.
- Introducing new common letters (e.g., **U**, **D**).

**CURED** fits these criteria:
- Starts with **C** (position 1 correct).
- **U** (position 2): new letter, tests a common vowel.
- **R** (position 3): tests R in a new position (position 3).
- **E** (position 4): tests E in a new position (position 4).
- **D** (position 5): new consonant.

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while leveraging the known constraints.",Guess 2: cured -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(✓) R(✓) E(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
