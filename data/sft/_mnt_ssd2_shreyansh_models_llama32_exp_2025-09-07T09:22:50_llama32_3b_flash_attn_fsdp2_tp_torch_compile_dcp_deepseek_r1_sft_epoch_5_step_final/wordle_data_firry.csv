 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", R is at position 2, and it's marked as wrong position).
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and does not contain C, A, N, E.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter R (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the second (because in the first guess it was in position 2 and was wrong).
 2. Avoids the letters C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Since R is in the word, we can try to put R in a different position. Also, we know that the word does not have A, E, and also C and N.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible. We have eliminated A, E, and also C, N. So the remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but we avoid for now).

 We also know that the word has R, and we have 4 other letters to choose (from the alphabet without C, A, N, E).

 We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 A good second guess might be ""ROTLS"" but that's not a word. We need a valid 5-letter word.

 Let me think of words that have R and avoid C, A, N, E.

 Possible words: 
   ""ROILS"" (meaning: to agitate) -> but we don't know if O, I, L, S are in the word.
   ""ROUST"" (meaning: to drive out or disturb) -> R at position 1, but we know R is not at position 2? Actually, we don't know about position 1. In the first guess, R was at position 2 and was wrong, but it could be at position 1? However, we don't have information about position 1 yet.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess only tells us that R is in the word but not at position 2. It could be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 However, we also have to avoid the letters C, A, N, E.

 Let me try to come up with a word that has R and uses other common letters.

 Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should try to include as many of these as possible.

 A good candidate might be ""SPRIT"" but that's not a common word. Another idea: ""TRIES"" - but note that we have 5 letters and we want to avoid the known absent letters.

 However, we must avoid A, E, C, N.

 Let me think of words that have R and use common letters.

 Option 1: ""ROTLS"" is not a word. How about ""ROUST""? That's valid.

 But note: we have the letter U? We don't know about U. And we haven't tried S, T, L.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PRIOR"" but that has two R's? And we don't know if there are two R's. But the feedback for the first guess only showed one R? Actually, the feedback only marks the letters that are present. If there are two R's, then both would be marked? But in the first guess, we only had one R and it was marked as present (but wrong position). So the word has at least one R. It might have two.

 However, we don't have information about duplicates. So we can try a word with duplicate R? But we don't know.

 But to keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another candidate: ""ROOMy"" - but that has two O's and we don't know about O. Also, Y is at the end.

 However, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let me try ""ROUST"": 
   R at position 1 (which is a new position for R, so we can check if R is at position 1)
   O, U, S, T are new letters.

 But note: we know R is in the word, so if we put R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If it's not, then we know R must be in one of the other positions (3,4,5) and also we get information about O, U, S, T.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a position we haven't tried (like position 3,4,5) and also includes other common letters.

 Another idea: ""TRIOS"" - but that has T, R, I, O, S. But note: we have to avoid A, E, C, N. This word doesn't have those.

 However, we already know R is in the word, so we don't need to test R again? Actually, we do need to test R because we want to find its position. And we can test it in a new position.

 But note: in the first guess, R was at position 2. So we can try position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Let me try to choose a word that has R in a position that is not 2, and also includes other common letters.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 I think ""ROUST"" is a good candidate: 
   R at 1 (new position), O, U, S, T are all new.

 But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""ROUST"" is a valid English word.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RUSTS"" but that has duplicate S? And we don't know about S.

 Another option: ""ROILS"" (meaning: to agitate) -> R at 1, and then O, I, L, S.

 But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So we are safe.

 However, we might also consider that the word might have the letter R and we can test it in position 1.

 But let me check: if we put R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If it's not, then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5. And we also test O, U, S, T.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in position 3,4, or 5 and also includes other common letters.

 For example: 
   ""PARTY"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, E, C, N.

 So let me try ""DIRTY"": 
   D, I, R, T, Y. 
   R is at position 3. 
   This word avoids the forbidden letters.

 But note: we don't know if D, I, T, Y are in the word. And we are testing R at position 3.

 However, we also want to test more common letters. Let's compare:

 Option 1: ""ROUST"" -> tests R at 1, and letters O, U, S, T.
 Option 2: ""DIRTY"" -> tests R at 3, and letters D, I, T, Y.

 Both are valid. But ""ROUST"" uses more common letters? S and T are very common.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have S or T? We don't know.

 But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So the remaining common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

 I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice because it tests R in a new position (1) and also tests S, T, O, U.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 1, we might get:
   If R is at position 1: then we get a check for R.
   If not, then we get a dash for R (meaning it's in the word but not at position 1) and then we know R must be at 3,4, or 5.

 Also, we test O, U, S, T.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROTLS"" but that's not a word. How about ""ROILS""? 
   ""ROILS"" is a word (meaning: to agitate). It has R at 1, and then O, I, L, S.

 But note: we are testing the same letters as ""ROUST"" but in different order? Actually, ""ROILS"" has R at 1, O at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.

 However, we know that the secret word does not have A, E, C, N. So we can use ""ROILS"".

 But let me check: we have not tried O, I, L, S. And we are testing R at position 1.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a position that we haven't tried and also tests more common letters.

 Another candidate: ""SPORT"" -> S, P, O, R, T. But note: R is at position 4. This tests S, P, O, R, T. And we avoid the forbidden letters.

 However, we already know R is in the word, so we are testing S, P, O, T.

 But we are testing R at position 4. Also, we are testing S at position 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 5.

 This seems good.

 However, we must note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ""ROUST"" -> tests R at 1, and letters O, U, S, T.
 Option 2: ""SPORT"" -> tests R at 4, and letters S, P, O, T.

 Both are good. But ""SPORT"" tests more common letters? S, T, O are common.

 But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So the remaining common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

 I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it tests S, P, O, T and R at a new position (4). Also, it uses R at position 4 (which is one of the possibilities) and we get feedback on the other positions.

 However, we must be cautious: if the word has R at position 1, then in ""SPORT"" the R at position 4 would be marked as absent? Actually, no: the feedback marks each letter independently. But note: if the word has two R's, then if we put R in a position that is not present, it would be marked as dash if there is another R? Actually, the feedback is per letter occurrence. But we don't know if there are two R's.

 To avoid confusion, we might prefer a word without duplicate letters.

 So let me avoid duplicates.

 Therefore, I choose ""SPORT"" because it tests four new common letters (S, P, O, T) and R at position 4.

 But wait: we have to consider that the word might have R at position 1. So if we put R at position 4 and it is not correct, then we still don't know about position 1? Actually, we will know: if R is not at position 4, then we get a dash for R and we know R must be at 1,3, or 5. But we have tested position 4 and it was wrong, so then we can try position 1 in the next guess.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and also tests other common letters.

 How about ""RUSTS""? That has duplicate S. We don't want that.

 How about ""ROAST""? But A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So we cannot use A.

 How about ""ROBOT""? But B and T are new, but we have two O's? And we don't know about O. Also, we have to avoid A, E, C, N. This word doesn't have those, but it has two O's and two O's? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, O at 4, T at 5. But we are testing O twice? And we don't know if O is in the word.

 But we are testing R at position 1 and O at position 2? Also, we are testing B and T.

 However, we already know that the secret word does not have A, E, C, N. So we can use ""ROBOT"". But we are testing O twice? That might not be efficient.

 Alternatively, ""ROWDY"": R at 1, O at 2, W at 3, D at 4, Y at 5. This tests R at 1 and O at 2. But we don't test S or T.

 Since S and T are very common, I think including them is better.

 How about ""ROUST"" again? It tests R at 1, and also O, U, S, T.

 I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter R and we are testing it at position 1. If it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5.

 Also, we test O, U, S, T.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPORT"" to test R at position 4 and also test S, P, O, T.

 I think both are reasonable. Let me pick ""SPORT"" because it tests S, P, O, T and R at a new position.

 But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, N, E. ""SPORT"" does not contain any of these.

 So I will go with ""SPORT"".

 However, note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter R and we are testing it at position 4. If the R is at position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know R is at 1,3, or 5.

 Also, we get feedback on S, P, O, T.

 Let me write the guess: ""SPORT""

 But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 4, we might get:

   If R is at position 4: then we get a check for R.
   If R is not at position 4, then we get a dash for R (meaning it's in the word but not at position 4) and then we know R must be at 1,3, or 5.

 Also, we test S at position 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 5.

 We might get more information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and also tests other common letters. For example, ""ROBOT"" is not ideal because of duplicate O.

 Another candidate: ""RUSTY"" -> R at 1, U at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. This tests R at 1 and U, S, T, Y.

 But Y is less common.

 How about ""RISKY""? But that has S and K, but also I and Y. And R at 1.

 But we don't know if I is in the word.

 After considering, I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice.

 Let me check if ""SPORT"" is a valid word: yes.

 So I will guess ""SPORT"".

 But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any of the absent letters. We are not.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""SPORT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2.
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Include R (since it's confirmed in the word) but avoid position 2.
2. Exclude C, A, N, E.
3. Test new common letters to gather more information.

I chose ""SPORT"" because:
- R is placed in position 4 (a new position to test).
- It introduces four new common letters: S, P, O, T.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, A, N, E) and duplicates.
- If R is in position 4, it will be marked correct; if not, the feedback will confirm R must be in position 1, 3, or 5, while providing info on S, P, O, T.

<guess>sport</guess>",sport,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)

 - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", R is at position 2, and it's marked as wrong position).

 However, we might also consider that the word might have the letter R and we can test it in position 1.

 But let me check: if we put R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If it's not, then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5. And we also test O, U, S, T.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in position 3,4, or 5 and also includes other common letters.

 For example: 
   ""PARTY"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, E, C, N.

 So let me try ""DIRTY"": 
   D, I, R, T, Y. 
   R is at position 3. 
   This word avoids the forbidden letters.

 But note: we don't know if D, I, T, Y are in the word. And we are testing R at position 3.

 However, we also want to test more common letters. Let's compare:

 Option 1: ""ROUST"" -> tests R at 1, and letters O, U, S, T.
 Option 2: ""DIRTY"" -> tests R at 3, and letters D, I, T, Y.

 Both are valid. But ""ROUST"" uses more common letters? S and T are very common.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have S or T? We don't know.

 But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So the remaining common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

 I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice because it tests R in a new position (1) and also tests S, T, O, U.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 1, we might get:
   If R is at position 1: then we get a check for R.
   If not, then we get a dash for R (meaning it's in the word but not at position 1) and then we know R must be at 3,4, or 5.

 Also, we test O, U, S, T.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROTLS"" but that's not a word. How about ""ROILS""? 
   ""ROILS"" is a word (meaning: to agitate). It has R at 1, and then O, I, L, S.

 But note: we are testing the same letters as ""ROUST"" but in different order? Actually, ""ROILS"" has R at 1, O at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.

 However, we know that the secret word does not have A, E, C, N. So we can use ""ROILS"".

 But let me check: we have not tried O, I, L, S. And we are testing R at position 1.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a position that we haven't tried and also tests more common letters.

 Another candidate: ""SPORT"" -> S, P, O, R, T. But note: R is at position 4. This tests S, P, O, R, T. And we avoid the forbidden letters.

 However, we already know R is in the word, so we are testing S, P, O, T.

 But we are testing R at position 4. Also, we are testing S at position 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 5.

 This seems good.

 However, we must note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ""ROUST"" -> tests R at 1, and letters O, U, S, T.
 Option 2: ""SPORT"" -> tests R at 4, and letters S, P, O, T.

 Both are good. But ""SPORT"" tests more common letters? S, T, O are common.

 But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So the remaining common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

 I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it tests S, P, O, T and R at a new position (4). Also, it uses R at position 4 (which is one of the possibilities) and we get feedback on the other positions.

 However, we must be cautious: if the word has R at position 1, then in ""SPORT"" the R at position 4 would be marked as absent? Actually, no: the feedback marks each letter independently. But note: if the word has two R's, then if we put R in a position that is not present, it would be marked as dash if there is another R? Actually, the feedback is per letter occurrence. But we don't know if there are two R's.

 To avoid confusion, we might prefer a word without duplicate letters.

 So let me avoid duplicates.

 Therefore, I choose ""SPORT"" because it tests four new common letters (S, P, O, T) and R at position 4.

 But wait: we have to consider that the word might have R at position 1. So if we put R at position 4 and it is not correct, then we still don't know about position 1? Actually, we will know: if R is not at position 4, then we get a dash for R and we know R must be at 1,3, or 5. But we have tested position 4 and it was wrong, so then we can try position 1 in the next guess.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and also tests other common letters.

 How about ""RUSTS""? That has duplicate S. We don't want that.

 How about ""ROAST""? But A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So we cannot use A.

 How about ""ROBOT""? But B and T are new, but we have two O's? And we don't know about O. Also, we have to avoid A, E, C, N. This word doesn't have those, but it has two O's and two O's? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, O at 4, T at 5. But we are testing O twice? And we don't know if O is in the word.

 But we are testing R at position 1 and O at position 2? Also, we are testing B and T.

 However, we already know that the secret word does not have A, E, C, N. So we can use ""ROBOT"". But we are testing O twice? That might not be efficient.

 Alternatively, ""ROWDY"": R at 1, O at 2, W at 3, D at 4, Y at 5. This tests R at 1 and O at 2. But we don't test S or T.

 Since S and T are very common, I think including them is better.

 How about ""ROUST"" again? It tests R at 1, and also O, U, S, T.

 I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter R and we are testing it at position 1. If it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5.

 Also, we test O, U, S, T.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPORT"" to test R at position 4 and also test S, P, O, T.

 I think both are reasonable. Let me pick ""SPORT"" because it tests S, P, O, T and R at a new position.

 But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, N, E. ""SPORT"" does not contain any of these.

 So I will go with ""SPORT"".

 However, note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter R and we are testing it at position 4. If the R is at position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know R is at 1,3, or 5.

 Also, we get feedback on S, P, O, T.

 Let me write the guess: ""SPORT""

 But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 4, we might get:

   If R is at position 4: then we get a check for R.
   If R is not at position 4, then we get a dash for R (meaning it's in the word but not at position 4) and then we know R must be at 1,3, or 5.

 Also, we test S at position 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 5.

 We might get more information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and also tests other common letters. For example, ""ROBOT"" is not ideal because of duplicate O.

 Another candidate: ""RUSTY"" -> R at 1, U at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. This tests R at 1 and U, S, T, Y.

 But Y is less common.

 How about ""RISKY""? But that has S and K, but also I and Y. And R at 1.

 But we don't know if I is in the word.

 After considering, I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice.

 Let me check if ""SPORT"" is a valid word: yes.

 So I will guess ""SPORT"".

 But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any of the absent letters. We are not.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2.
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Include R (since it's confirmed in the word) but avoid position 2.
2. Exclude C, A, N, E.
3. Test new common letters to gather more information.

I chose ""SPORT"" because:
- R is placed in position 4 (a new position to test).
- It introduces four new common letters: S, P, O, T.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, A, N, E) and duplicates.
- If R is in position 4, it will be marked correct; if not, the feedback will confirm R must be in position 1, 3, or 5, while providing info on S, P, O, T.",Guess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) R(✓) T(x),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 06 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", R is at position 2, and it's marked as wrong position).
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and does not contain C, A, N, E.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter R (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the second (because in the first guess it was in position 2 and was wrong).
 2. Avoids the letters C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Since R is in the word, we can try to put R in a different position. Also, we know that the word does not have A, E, and also C and N.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible. We have eliminated A, E, and also C, N. So the remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but we avoid for now).

 We also know that the word has R, and we have 4 other letters to choose (from the alphabet without C, A, N, E).

 We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 A good second guess might be ""ROTLS"" but that's not a word. We need a valid 5-letter word.

 Let me think of words that have R and avoid C, A, N, E.

 Possible words: 
   ""ROILS"" (meaning: to agitate) -> but we don't know if O, I, L, S are in the word.
   ""ROUST"" (meaning: to drive out or disturb) -> R at position 1, but we know R is not at position 2? Actually, we don't know about position 1. In the first guess, R was at position 2 and was wrong, but it could be at position 1? However, we don't have information about position 1 yet.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess only tells us that R is in the word but not at position 2. It could be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 However, we also have to avoid the letters C, A, N, E.

 Let me try to come up with a word that has R and uses other common letters.

 Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should try to include as many of these as possible.

 A good candidate might be ""SPRIT"" but that's not a common word. Another idea: ""TRIES"" - but note that we have 5 letters and we want to avoid the known absent letters.

 However, we must avoid A, E, C, N.

 Let me think of words that have R and use common letters.

 Option 1: ""ROTLS"" is not a word. How about ""ROUST""? That's valid.

 But note: we have the letter U? We don't know about U. And we haven't tried S, T, L.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PRIOR"" but that has two R's? And we don't know if there are two R's. But the feedback for the first guess only showed one R? Actually, the feedback only marks the letters that are present. If there are two R's, then both would be marked? But in the first guess, we only had one R and it was marked as present (but wrong position). So the word has at least one R. It might have two.

 However, we don't have information about duplicates. So we can try a word with duplicate R? But we don't know.

 But to keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another candidate: ""ROOMy"" - but that has two O's and we don't know about O. Also, Y is at the end.

 However, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let me try ""ROUST"": 
   R at position 1 (which is a new position for R, so we can check if R is at position 1)
   O, U, S, T are new letters.

 But note: we know R is in the word, so if we put R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If it's not, then we know R must be in one of the other positions (3,4,5) and also we get information about O, U, S, T.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a position we haven't tried (like position 3,4,5) and also includes other common letters.

 Another idea: ""TRIOS"" - but that has T, R, I, O, S. But note: we have to avoid A, E, C, N. This word doesn't have those.

 However, we already know R is in the word, so we don't need to test R again? Actually, we do need to test R because we want to find its position. And we can test it in a new position.

 But note: in the first guess, R was at position 2. So we can try position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Let me try to choose a word that has R in a position that is not 2, and also includes other common letters.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 I think ""ROUST"" is a good candidate: 
   R at 1 (new position), O, U, S, T are all new.

 But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""ROUST"" is a valid English word.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RUSTS"" but that has duplicate S? And we don't know about S.

 Another option: ""ROILS"" (meaning: to agitate) -> R at 1, and then O, I, L, S.

 But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So we are safe.

 However, we might also consider that the word might have the letter R and we can test it in position 1.

 But let me check: if we put R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If it's not, then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5. And we also test O, U, S, T.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in position 3,4, or 5 and also includes other common letters.

 For example: 
   ""PARTY"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, E, C, N.

 So let me try ""DIRTY"": 
   D, I, R, T, Y. 
   R is at position 3. 
   This word avoids the forbidden letters.

 But note: we don't know if D, I, T, Y are in the word. And we are testing R at position 3.

 However, we also want to test more common letters. Let's compare:

 Option 1: ""ROUST"" -> tests R at 1, and letters O, U, S, T.
 Option 2: ""DIRTY"" -> tests R at 3, and letters D, I, T, Y.

 Both are valid. But ""ROUST"" uses more common letters? S and T are very common.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have S or T? We don't know.

 But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So the remaining common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

 I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice because it tests R in a new position (1) and also tests S, T, O, U.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 1, we might get:
   If R is at position 1: then we get a check for R.
   If not, then we get a dash for R (meaning it's in the word but not at position 1) and then we know R must be at 3,4, or 5.

 Also, we test O, U, S, T.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROTLS"" but that's not a word. How about ""ROILS""? 
   ""ROILS"" is a word (meaning: to agitate). It has R at 1, and then O, I, L, S.

 But note: we are testing the same letters as ""ROUST"" but in different order? Actually, ""ROILS"" has R at 1, O at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.

 However, we know that the secret word does not have A, E, C, N. So we can use ""ROILS"".

 But let me check: we have not tried O, I, L, S. And we are testing R at position 1.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a position that we haven't tried and also tests more common letters.

 Another candidate: ""SPORT"" -> S, P, O, R, T. But note: R is at position 4. This tests S, P, O, R, T. And we avoid the forbidden letters.

 However, we already know R is in the word, so we are testing S, P, O, T.

 But we are testing R at position 4. Also, we are testing S at position 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 5.

 This seems good.

 However, we must note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ""ROUST"" -> tests R at 1, and letters O, U, S, T.
 Option 2: ""SPORT"" -> tests R at 4, and letters S, P, O, T.

 Both are good. But ""SPORT"" tests more common letters? S, T, O are common.

 But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So the remaining common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

 I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it tests S, P, O, T and R at a new position (4). Also, it uses R at position 4 (which is one of the possibilities) and we get feedback on the other positions.

 However, we must be cautious: if the word has R at position 1, then in ""SPORT"" the R at position 4 would be marked as absent? Actually, no: the feedback marks each letter independently. But note: if the word has two R's, then if we put R in a position that is not present, it would be marked as dash if there is another R? Actually, the feedback is per letter occurrence. But we don't know if there are two R's.

 To avoid confusion, we might prefer a word without duplicate letters.

 So let me avoid duplicates.

 Therefore, I choose ""SPORT"" because it tests four new common letters (S, P, O, T) and R at position 4.

 But wait: we have to consider that the word might have R at position 1. So if we put R at position 4 and it is not correct, then we still don't know about position 1? Actually, we will know: if R is not at position 4, then we get a dash for R and we know R must be at 1,3, or 5. But we have tested position 4 and it was wrong, so then we can try position 1 in the next guess.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and also tests other common letters.

 How about ""RUSTS""? That has duplicate S. We don't want that.

 How about ""ROAST""? But A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So we cannot use A.

 How about ""ROBOT""? But B and T are new, but we have two O's? And we don't know about O. Also, we have to avoid A, E, C, N. This word doesn't have those, but it has two O's and two O's? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, O at 4, T at 5. But we are testing O twice? And we don't know if O is in the word.

 But we are testing R at position 1 and O at position 2? Also, we are testing B and T.

 However, we already know that the secret word does not have A, E, C, N. So we can use ""ROBOT"". But we are testing O twice? That might not be efficient.

 Alternatively, ""ROWDY"": R at 1, O at 2, W at 3, D at 4, Y at 5. This tests R at 1 and O at 2. But we don't test S or T.

 Since S and T are very common, I think including them is better.

 How about ""ROUST"" again? It tests R at 1, and also O, U, S, T.

 I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter R and we are testing it at position 1. If it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5.

 Also, we test O, U, S, T.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPORT"" to test R at position 4 and also test S, P, O, T.

 I think both are reasonable. Let me pick ""SPORT"" because it tests S, P, O, T and R at a new position.

 But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, N, E. ""SPORT"" does not contain any of these.

 So I will go with ""SPORT"".

 However, note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter R and we are testing it at position 4. If the R is at position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know R is at 1,3, or 5.

 Also, we get feedback on S, P, O, T.

 Let me write the guess: ""SPORT""

 But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 4, we might get:

   If R is at position 4: then we get a check for R.
   If R is not at position 4, then we get a dash for R (meaning it's in the word but not at position 4) and then we know R must be at 1,3, or 5.

 Also, we test S at position 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 5.

 We might get more information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and also tests other common letters. For example, ""ROBOT"" is not ideal because of duplicate O.

 Another candidate: ""RUSTY"" -> R at 1, U at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. This tests R at 1 and U, S, T, Y.

 But Y is less common.

 How about ""RISKY""? But that has S and K, but also I and Y. And R at 1.

 But we don't know if I is in the word.

 After considering, I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice.

 Let me check if ""SPORT"" is a valid word: yes.

 So I will guess ""SPORT"".

 But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any of the absent letters. We are not.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2.
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Include R (since it's confirmed in the word) but avoid position 2.
2. Exclude C, A, N, E.
3. Test new common letters to gather more information.

I chose ""SPORT"" because:
- R is placed in position 4 (a new position to test).
- It introduces four new common letters: S, P, O, T.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, A, N, E) and duplicates.
- If R is in position 4, it will be marked correct; if not, the feedback will confirm R must be in position 1, 3, or 5, while providing info on S, P, O, T.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.\n I\'ll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.\n\n So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":\n C: x (not in the word)\n R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n A: x (not in the word)\n N: x (not in the word)\n E: x (not in the word)\n\n So, from this feedback, we know:\n - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", R is at position 2, and it\'s marked as wrong position).\n - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.\n\n Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and does not contain C, A, N, E.\n\n We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).\n\n For the next guess, we should choose a word that:\n 1. Includes the letter R (since we know it\'s in the word) and places it in a different position than the second (because in the first guess it was in position 2 and was wrong).\n 2. Avoids the letters C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).\n 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.\n\n Since R is in the word, we can try to put R in a different position. Also, we know that the word does not have A, E, and also C and N.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that are still possible. We have eliminated A, E, and also C, N. So the remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but we avoid for now).\n\n We also know that the word has R, and we have 4 other letters to choose (from the alphabet without C, A, N, E).\n\n We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\n A good second guess might be ""ROTLS"" but that\'s not a word. We need a valid 5-letter word.\n\n Let me think of words that have R and avoid C, A, N, E.\n\n Possible words: \n   ""ROILS"" (meaning: to agitate) -> but we don\'t know if O, I, L, S are in the word.\n   ""ROUST"" (meaning: to drive out or disturb) -> R at position 1, but we know R is not at position 2? Actually, we don\'t know about position 1. In the first guess, R was at position 2 and was wrong, but it could be at position 1? However, we don\'t have information about position 1 yet.\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess only tells us that R is in the word but not at position 2. It could be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n However, we also have to avoid the letters C, A, N, E.\n\n Let me try to come up with a word that has R and uses other common letters.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We should try to include as many of these as possible.\n\n A good candidate might be ""SPRIT"" but that\'s not a common word. Another idea: ""TRIES"" - but note that we have 5 letters and we want to avoid the known absent letters.\n\n However, we must avoid A, E, C, N.\n\n Let me think of words that have R and use common letters.\n\n Option 1: ""ROTLS"" is not a word. How about ""ROUST""? That\'s valid.\n\n But note: we have the letter U? We don\'t know about U. And we haven\'t tried S, T, L.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PRIOR"" but that has two R\'s? And we don\'t know if there are two R\'s. But the feedback for the first guess only showed one R? Actually, the feedback only marks the letters that are present. If there are two R\'s, then both would be marked? But in the first guess, we only had one R and it was marked as present (but wrong position). So the word has at least one R. It might have two.\n\n However, we don\'t have information about duplicates. So we can try a word with duplicate R? But we don\'t know.\n\n But to keep it simple, let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Another candidate: ""ROOMy"" - but that has two O\'s and we don\'t know about O. Also, Y is at the end.\n\n However, we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let me try ""ROUST"": \n   R at position 1 (which is a new position for R, so we can check if R is at position 1)\n   O, U, S, T are new letters.\n\n But note: we know R is in the word, so if we put R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If it\'s not, then we know R must be in one of the other positions (3,4,5) and also we get information about O, U, S, T.\n\n However, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a position we haven\'t tried (like position 3,4,5) and also includes other common letters.\n\n Another idea: ""TRIOS"" - but that has T, R, I, O, S. But note: we have to avoid A, E, C, N. This word doesn\'t have those.\n\n However, we already know R is in the word, so we don\'t need to test R again? Actually, we do need to test R because we want to find its position. And we can test it in a new position.\n\n But note: in the first guess, R was at position 2. So we can try position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Let me try to choose a word that has R in a position that is not 2, and also includes other common letters.\n\n Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\n I think ""ROUST"" is a good candidate: \n   R at 1 (new position), O, U, S, T are all new.\n\n But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""ROUST"" is a valid English word.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RUSTS"" but that has duplicate S? And we don\'t know about S.\n\n Another option: ""ROILS"" (meaning: to agitate) -> R at 1, and then O, I, L, S.\n\n But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So we are safe.\n\n However, we might also consider that the word might have the letter R and we can test it in position 1.\n\n But let me check: if we put R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If it\'s not, then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5. And we also test O, U, S, T.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in position 3,4, or 5 and also includes other common letters.\n\n For example: \n   ""PARTY"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So we cannot use A.\n\n We must avoid A, E, C, N.\n\n So let me try ""DIRTY"": \n   D, I, R, T, Y. \n   R is at position 3. \n   This word avoids the forbidden letters.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if D, I, T, Y are in the word. And we are testing R at position 3.\n\n However, we also want to test more common letters. Let\'s compare:\n\n Option 1: ""ROUST"" -> tests R at 1, and letters O, U, S, T.\n Option 2: ""DIRTY"" -> tests R at 3, and letters D, I, T, Y.\n\n Both are valid. But ""ROUST"" uses more common letters? S and T are very common.\n\n However, we have to consider that the word might have S or T? We don\'t know.\n\n But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So the remaining common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.\n\n I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice because it tests R in a new position (1) and also tests S, T, O, U.\n\n But wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 1, we might get:\n   If R is at position 1: then we get a check for R.\n   If not, then we get a dash for R (meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 1) and then we know R must be at 3,4, or 5.\n\n Also, we test O, U, S, T.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROTLS"" but that\'s not a word. How about ""ROILS""? \n   ""ROILS"" is a word (meaning: to agitate). It has R at 1, and then O, I, L, S.\n\n But note: we are testing the same letters as ""ROUST"" but in different order? Actually, ""ROILS"" has R at 1, O at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.\n\n However, we know that the secret word does not have A, E, C, N. So we can use ""ROILS"".\n\n But let me check: we have not tried O, I, L, S. And we are testing R at position 1.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a position that we haven\'t tried and also tests more common letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""SPORT"" -> S, P, O, R, T. But note: R is at position 4. This tests S, P, O, R, T. And we avoid the forbidden letters.\n\n However, we already know R is in the word, so we are testing S, P, O, T.\n\n But we are testing R at position 4. Also, we are testing S at position 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 5.\n\n This seems good.\n\n However, we must note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n Option 1: ""ROUST"" -> tests R at 1, and letters O, U, S, T.\n Option 2: ""SPORT"" -> tests R at 4, and letters S, P, O, T.\n\n Both are good. But ""SPORT"" tests more common letters? S, T, O are common.\n\n But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So the remaining common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.\n\n I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it tests S, P, O, T and R at a new position (4). Also, it uses R at position 4 (which is one of the possibilities) and we get feedback on the other positions.\n\n However, we must be cautious: if the word has R at position 1, then in ""SPORT"" the R at position 4 would be marked as absent? Actually, no: the feedback marks each letter independently. But note: if the word has two R\'s, then if we put R in a position that is not present, it would be marked as dash if there is another R? Actually, the feedback is per letter occurrence. But we don\'t know if there are two R\'s.\n\n To avoid confusion, we might prefer a word without duplicate letters.\n\n So let me avoid duplicates.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""SPORT"" because it tests four new common letters (S, P, O, T) and R at position 4.\n\n But wait: we have to consider that the word might have R at position 1. So if we put R at position 4 and it is not correct, then we still don\'t know about position 1? Actually, we will know: if R is not at position 4, then we get a dash for R and we know R must be at 1,3, or 5. But we have tested position 4 and it was wrong, so then we can try position 1 in the next guess.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and also tests other common letters.\n\n How about ""RUSTS""? That has duplicate S. We don\'t want that.\n\n How about ""ROAST""? But A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So we cannot use A.\n\n How about ""ROBOT""? But B and T are new, but we have two O\'s? And we don\'t know about O. Also, we have to avoid A, E, C, N. This word doesn\'t have those, but it has two O\'s and two O\'s? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, O at 4, T at 5. But we are testing O twice? And we don\'t know if O is in the word.\n\n But we are testing R at position 1 and O at position 2? Also, we are testing B and T.\n\n However, we already know that the secret word does not have A, E, C, N. So we can use ""ROBOT"". But we are testing O twice? That might not be efficient.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROWDY"": R at 1, O at 2, W at 3, D at 4, Y at 5. This tests R at 1 and O at 2. But we don\'t test S or T.\n\n Since S and T are very common, I think including them is better.\n\n How about ""ROUST"" again? It tests R at 1, and also O, U, S, T.\n\n I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice.\n\n But note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter R and we are testing it at position 1. If it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5.\n\n Also, we test O, U, S, T.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""SPORT"" to test R at position 4 and also test S, P, O, T.\n\n I think both are reasonable. Let me pick ""SPORT"" because it tests S, P, O, T and R at a new position.\n\n But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, N, E. ""SPORT"" does not contain any of these.\n\n So I will go with ""SPORT"".\n\n However, note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter R and we are testing it at position 4. If the R is at position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know R is at 1,3, or 5.\n\n Also, we get feedback on S, P, O, T.\n\n Let me write the guess: ""SPORT""\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 4, we might get:\n\n   If R is at position 4: then we get a check for R.\n   If R is not at position 4, then we get a dash for R (meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 4) and then we know R must be at 1,3, or 5.\n\n Also, we test S at position 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 5.\n\n We might get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and also tests other common letters. For example, ""ROBOT"" is not ideal because of duplicate O.\n\n Another candidate: ""RUSTY"" -> R at 1, U at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. This tests R at 1 and U, S, T, Y.\n\n But Y is less common.\n\n How about ""RISKY""? But that has S and K, but also I and Y. And R at 1.\n\n But we don\'t know if I is in the word.\n\n After considering, I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice.\n\n Let me check if ""SPORT"" is a valid word: yes.\n\n So I will guess ""SPORT"".\n\n But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any of the absent letters. We are not.\n\n Therefore, the next guess is ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- R is in the secret word but not in position 2.\n- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.\n\nFor the next guess, I need to:\n1. Include R (since it\'s confirmed in the word) but avoid position 2.\n2. Exclude C, A, N, E.\n3. Test new common letters to gather more information.\n\nI chose ""SPORT"" because:\n- R is placed in position 4 (a new position to test).\n- It introduces four new common letters: S, P, O, T.\n- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, A, N, E) and duplicates.\n- If R is in position 4, it will be marked correct; if not, the feedback will confirm R must be in position 1, 3, or 5, while providing info on S, P, O, T.\n\n<guess>sport</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) R(✓) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word but wrong position; specifically, not at position 2)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""sport""
  S: x (not in the word)
  P: x (not in the word)
  O: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct, meaning R is in the word and in position 4)
  T: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word has the letter R in the 4th position (since R was marked correct in ""sport"").
2. The secret word contains the letter R, and we now know it is at position 4.
3. The letters C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T are not in the secret word.

So the secret word has the form: _ _ _ R _

We have eliminated the letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T.

The remaining letters to consider are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word must have 5 letters, with R at position 4.

We need to choose a word that:
- Has R at position 4.
- Uses only letters from the remaining set (avoiding C,A,N,E,S,P,O,T).
- Tests new common letters to maximize information.

Common letters from the remaining set: L, I, D, U, M, H, G, B, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Possible words that fit the pattern _ _ _ R _ and use only the remaining letters:

Let's think of words:

- ""DIRTY"": but D, I, R, T, Y -> but T is eliminated (from guess2: T is not in the word). So invalid.

- ""BIRTH"": B, I, R, T, H -> T is eliminated. Invalid.

- ""MIRTH"": same issue.

- ""GIRTH"": same issue.

- ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> but A is eliminated. Invalid.

- ""HAIRY"": H, A, I, R, Y -> A eliminated.

- ""FAIRY"": F, A, I, R, Y -> A eliminated.

- ""BUILT"": B, U, I, L, T -> T eliminated.

- ""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> but we have R at position 4? The word is G-U-I-L-D, so R is missing. We need R at position 4.

We must have R at position 4.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ R _

Let me try to find words that fit this pattern and use only the remaining letters.

Possible words:

- ""QUICK"": but Q and K are still available? But note: we have eliminated C and K? Actually, we haven't eliminated K. But wait, ""QUICK"" has C which is eliminated. So invalid.

- ""QUIRK"": but that's not a word.

- ""BRICK"": B, R, I, C, K -> but C is eliminated.

- ""PRICK"": P is eliminated.

- ""WRING"": W, R, I, N, G -> but N is eliminated.

- ""GRIMY"": G, R, I, M, Y -> but we have R at position 2? The pattern is _ _ _ R _, so position 2 must be a letter. In ""GRIMY"", R is at position 2, not 4. So that doesn't fit.

We need R at position 4.

Another idea: ""FERRY"" -> but E is eliminated and also R is at position 2 and 3? Not at 4.

""BERRY"": B, E, R, R, Y -> E eliminated and R at position 3? Not 4.

""DIRGE"": D, I, R, G, E -> E eliminated.

""VIRUS"": V, I, R, U, S -> S eliminated.

""LYRIC"": L, Y, R, I, C -> C eliminated.

""MYRRH"": M, Y, R, R, H -> R at position 3 and 4? Actually, position 4 is R. But we have two R's? And we don't know if there are two R's. But the word is M-Y-R-R-H. So positions: M(1), Y(2), R(3), R(4), H(5). But we have R at position 4, which is good. But we are testing M, Y, H and also the second R? But we don't know if there is a second R.

However, we are limited by the available letters. We must avoid the eliminated letters.

But note: we have not eliminated M, Y, H. So ""MYRRH"" is a valid word? Yes, but it has two R's. We don't know if the secret word has two R's. But that's acceptable.

But we are testing R at position 4 which we know is correct, and also we are testing M at position 1, Y at position 2, and H at position 5.

But we are also testing the second R at position 3. If the secret word has only one R, then the second R might be marked as absent? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicate R.

How about ""MURKY"": M, U, R, K, Y -> R is at position 3? Not 4.

""BURLY"": B, U, R, L, Y -> R at position 3? Not 4.

We need R at position 4.

Another try: ""HURRY"": H, U, R, R, Y -> R at position 3 and 4? Actually, position 3 is R, position 4 is R? The word is H-U-R-R-Y, so position 4 is R. But we have two R's. And we are testing H, U, Y.

But we have to avoid E, which we are.

But is ""HURRY"" a valid word? Yes.

However, we are testing the same letter twice. We might get less information.

Another word: ""FUROR"": F, U, R, O, R -> but O is eliminated (from guess2: O is not in the word). So invalid.

""LIRIP"": not a word.

""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> no R at position 4.

We need R at position 4.

Let me think: words ending with R? But that would be position 4? Actually, position 4 is the fourth letter. So we need a word with the fourth letter R.

Pattern: _ _ _ R _

So the word has the form: letter1, letter2, letter3, R, letter5.

Now, letter1, letter2, letter3, and letter5 must be from the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And the word must be valid.

Some possibilities:

- ""MIRTH"": but H is at position 5? And we have I at position 3. But the word is M-I-R-T-H? No, that's M-I-R-T-H? But we need R at position 4. Actually, ""MIRTH"" is M-I-R-T-H -> positions: M(1), I(2), R(3), T(4), H(5). So R is at position 3, not 4. So that doesn't work.

We need R at position 4.

How about:

- ""BIRTH"": B, I, R, T, H -> again, R at position 3.

- ""DIRGE"": D, I, R, G, E -> E eliminated.

- ""FIRIE"": not a word.

- ""GIRLY"": G, I, R, L, Y -> R at position 3.

- ""HORNY"": H, O, R, N, Y -> O and N eliminated.

- ""LIRIP"": not a word.

- ""MIRZA"": M, I, R, Z, A -> A eliminated.

- ""MIRTH"" is not correct because R is at 3.

Another idea: ""QUICK"" is invalid because of C.

""QUIRK"" is not a word.

""BRINK"": B, R, I, N, K -> N eliminated.

""BRISK"": B, R, I, S, K -> S eliminated.

""CRIMP"": C eliminated.

""DRUID"": D, R, U, I, D -> R at position 2? Not 4.

We need to focus on words with R at position 4.

How about ""CURRY"": C eliminated.

""BURGH"": B, U, R, G, H -> R at position 3? Not 4.

""WORDY"": W, O, R, D, Y -> O eliminated.

""FORUM"": F, O, R, U, M -> O eliminated.

""LYRUM"": L, Y, R, U, M -> R at position 3? Not 4.

Position 4 is the fourth letter. So we need words where the fourth letter is R.

Examples:

- ""BURQA"": not a common word, and A eliminated.

- ""DIRRA"": not a word.

- ""FURCA"": not a word.

- ""HURRA"": not a word.

- ""MURA"": not 5 letters.

- ""PUREA"": not a word.

- ""TURMA"": not a word.

- ""WORRY"": W, O, R, R, Y -> O eliminated.

- ""CURRY"": C eliminated.

- ""SURFY"": not a word.

- ""HURRY"": H, U, R, R, Y -> this is a word. And it uses H, U, Y and has R at position 4? Let's see: 
  Position 1: H
  Position 2: U
  Position 3: R
  Position 4: R? No, position 4 is the fourth letter. In ""HURRY"", the letters are:
  H (1), U (2), R (3), R (4), Y (5)

So yes, R is at position 4. And the letters are H, U, R, R, Y. We have R at position 3 and 4. But we know R is at position 4, so the R at position 3 might be redundant? But we are testing R at position 4, and also we are testing H, U, Y.

But we are testing the same letter twice. If the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 3 might be marked as absent? But we know R is at position 4, so the R at position 3 might be considered as not present? Actually, the feedback marks each letter independently. But if the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 3 would be marked as absent (x) and the R at position 4 is correct.

But we are testing U and H as well.

However, we are testing the same letter twice, which might not be efficient.

But we have to use the available letters.

Another word: ""MURKY"" -> M, U, R, K, Y -> R is at position 3? Not 4.

""URBAN"": U, R, B, A, N -> A and N eliminated.

""URBEX"": not a word.

""UMBRA"": U, M, B, R, A -> A eliminated.

""UMBRA"" is invalid.

""DUVET"": D, U, V, E, T -> E and T eliminated.

""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> P and S eliminated.

""QUADS"": Q, U, A, D, S -> A and S eliminated.

This is difficult.

Another possibility: ""LURID"": L, U, R, I, D -> R at position 3? Not 4.

""RUDDY"": R, U, D, D, Y -> R at position 1? Not 4.

We need to focus on words that have R at position 4.

How about ""AURUM"" -> A eliminated.

""CURUM"" -> C eliminated.

""DUVET"" -> eliminated letters.

Perhaps ""MURKY"" is not working.

Another idea: ""HURRY"" is one valid word. And it uses H, U, Y. But we are testing two R's.

But we have to consider that the secret word might have two R's? We don't know.

Alternatively, we can try ""GIRTH"": G, I, R, T, H -> T eliminated.

""birth"" is B-I-R-T-H -> R at position 3.

""RHYME"": R at position 1, but E and H? E is eliminated.

""WHIRL"": W, H, I, R, L -> R at position 4? 
  Position 1: W
  Position 2: H
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: R
  Position 5: L

Yes! So ""WHIRL"" is a word (meaning: to make whirled or moved in a spiral). And it uses W, H, I, L.

And the letters are W, H, I, L, and R at position 4.

We haven't tried W, H, I, L. And we avoid the eliminated letters.

So this is a good candidate.

Another word: ""SHIRK"": S eliminated.

""THIRL"": not a word.

""WHIRL"" is valid.

Another one: ""CHIRP"": C eliminated.

""MYRRH"": as before, but R at position 4? M(1), Y(2), R(3), R(4), H(5) -> yes, R at 4.

But ""MYRRH"" is not a common word. ""HURRY"" is more common.

But ""HURRY"" has two R's. We can try ""WHIRL"" which has only one R and four new letters.

""WHIRL"": 
  W at 1, H at 2, I at 3, L at 5.

If the secret word has R at position 4, then we get a check for R at position 4. And we test W, H, I, L.

If the secret word does not have R at position 4, then we get a dash for R at position 4? But we know R is in the word, and we have R at position 4. If the secret word has R at position 4, then we get a check. If not, then we get a dash and we know R must be at position 1,3, or 5? But we have position 3 as I and position 5 as L. So if R is not at 4, then we get a dash for R at position 4, and then we know R must be at 1,3, or 5. And we test W, H, I, L.

So ""WHIRL"" seems good.

Another candidate: ""MIRTH"" is not because R is at 3.

""GRIMY"": G, R, I, M, Y -> R at position 2? Not 4.

""DRUID"": R at 2.

""CRIMP"": C eliminated.

""WRING"": N eliminated.

""BRING"": N eliminated.

""FRISK"": F, R, I, S, K -> S eliminated.

""CRISP"": C and S eliminated.

""TRIPY"": T eliminated.

""VIPER"": V, I, P, E, R -> P and E eliminated.

""UDDER"": U, D, D, E, R -> E eliminated.

""DAILY"": A eliminated.

""GUILT"": G, U, I, L, T -> T eliminated.

""QUILT"": same.

""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> no R at position 4.

We need R at position 4.

Another word: ""CURVY"": C eliminated.

""LURCH"": L, U, R, C, H -> C eliminated.

""LYRCH"": not a word.

""MYRRH"": as before.

""YARNS"": Y, A, R, N, S -> A, N, S eliminated.

""YARKS"": same.

""YAWED"": Y, A, W, E, D -> A and E eliminated.

""YUCKS"": Y, U, C, K, S -> C and S eliminated.

""ZEBRA"": Z, E, B, R, A -> E and A eliminated.

""JUMPS"": P and S eliminated.

""QUADS"": A and S eliminated.

""QUAQU"": not 5 letters.

""QUICK"": C eliminated.

""QUIRK"": not a word.

""QUART"": A eliminated.

""QUART"" is 5 letters? Q-U-A-R-T, but A and T eliminated.

""QUASH"": S and A eliminated.

""QUASI"": not a word.

""QUAY"": not 5 letters.

""QUICK"" is out.

""QUILT"": Q, U, I, L, T -> T eliminated.

""QUINT"": Q, U, I, N, T -> N and T eliminated.

""QUIST"": not a word.

""QUIRL"": not a word.

""QUIRP"": not a word.

""QUICK"" is not.

Another idea: ""WHIRL"" is valid. Or ""WHIRL"" is valid.

""WHIRL"": W, H, I, R, L -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:I, 4:R, 5:L.

We can use this.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have R at position 4, and we are testing W, H, I, L.

If we get feedback that R is correct at position 4, then we know. If not, then R must be at 1,3, or 5.

Also, we test W, H, I, L.

Alternatively, we can try ""MURKY"": M, U, R, K, Y -> R at position 3? Not 4.

""MYRRH"": M, Y, R, R, H -> R at position 3 and 4. So if we put R at position 4, we might get a check for that one and a dash for the other? But we are testing two R's.

But ""MYRRH"" is not a common word. ""HURRY"" is more common.

But ""HURRY"" has two R's. We can try ""WHIRL"" which has only one R and four new letters.

Another word: ""DUVET"" -> eliminated.

""BEIGY"": not a word.

""DEARY"": D, E, A, R, Y -> E and A eliminated.

""HEART"": H, E, A, R, T -> E, A, T eliminated.

""HERON"": H, E, R, O, N -> E, O, N eliminated.

""HEROY"": not a word.

""MERIT"": M, E, R, I, T -> E and T eliminated.

""MERIT"" is out.

""MYTHS"": M, Y, T, H, S -> T and S eliminated.

""MYRRH"": M, Y, R, R, H -> this is a word. But we are testing M, Y, H and the two R's.

But we are testing R at position 3 and 4. We know position 4 is R, so if position 3 is R and it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know position 3 is not R, and we have information about M, Y, H.

But we are testing two R's, which might not be efficient.

Alternatively, ""WHIRL"" tests four new letters and one R (at position 4).

I think ""WHIRL"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: 
  Position 1: W
  Position 2: H
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: R (which we know is correct, so we expect a check for R at 4)
  Position 5: L

We are testing W, H, I, L and also confirming R at 4.

If the secret word has R at position 4, then we get a check for R. If not, we get a dash and then we know R must be at 1,3, or 5. And we get feedback on W, H, I, L.

Moreover, ""WHIRL"" is a valid English word.

So I will go with ""WHIRL"".

But note: we have to make sure that the word is in the dictionary. I believe ""whirl"" is a valid word.

Therefore, the next guess is ""WHIRL"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R is in the word but not in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""sport"")**: R is correct at position 4. S, P, O, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has **R in position 4** (pattern: `_ _ _ R _`).
- Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T** (cannot appear in the word).
- Remaining letters to test: **B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.
- Goal: Test new common letters while respecting the known R at position 4.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Choose a word that fits `_ _ _ R _` and uses only the remaining letters.
- Prioritize high-frequency letters from the remaining set (e.g., L, I, D, U, M, H) to maximize information.
- Avoid eliminated letters and duplicate letters (since we have no evidence of duplicates yet).

After evaluating possible words, **""WHIRL""** is selected because:
- It fits the pattern: `W H I R L` → R is at position 4.
- It tests four new common letters: **W, H, I, L** (all high-frequency and not yet tested).
- It avoids eliminated letters and has no duplicates.
- ""WHIRL"" is a valid English word (meaning: to move in a spiral or whirling).

This guess will:
- Confirm R at position 4 (we already know it's correct, so feedback will show ✓ for R).
- Provide new information about W, H, I, L: 
  - If any are correct (✓), misplaced (-), or absent (x), we narrow down possibilities significantly.

<guess>whirl</guess>",whirl,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word but wrong position; specifically, not at position 2)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""sport""
  S: x (not in the word)
  P: x (not in the word)
  O: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct, meaning R is in the word and in position 4)
  T: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word has the letter R in the 4th position (since R was marked correct in ""sport"").
2. The secret word contains the letter R, and we now know it is at position 4.
3. The letters C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T are not in the secret word.

So the secret word has the form: _ _ _ R _

We have eliminated the letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T.

The remaining letters to consider are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word must have 5 letters, with R at position 4.

We need to choose a word that:
- Has R at position 4.
- Uses only letters from the remaining set (avoiding C,A,N,E,S,P,O,T).
- Tests new common letters to maximize information.

Common letters from the remaining set: L, I, D, U, M, H, G, B, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Possible words that fit the pattern _ _ _ R _ and use only the remaining letters:

Let's think of words:

- ""DIRTY"": but D, I, R, T, Y -> but T is eliminated (from guess2: T is not in the word). So invalid.

- ""BIRTH"": B, I, R, T, H -> T is eliminated. Invalid.

- ""MIRTH"": same issue.

- ""GIRTH"": same issue.

- ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> but A is eliminated. Invalid.

- ""HAIRY"": H, A, I, R, Y -> A eliminated.

- ""FAIRY"": F, A, I, R, Y -> A eliminated.

- ""BUILT"": B, U, I, L, T -> T eliminated.

- ""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> but we have R at position 4? The word is G-U-I-L-D, so R is missing. We need R at position 4.

We must have R at position 4.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ R _

Let me try to find words that fit this pattern and use only the remaining letters.

Possible words:

- ""QUICK"": but Q and K are still available? But note: we have eliminated C and K? Actually, we haven't eliminated K. But wait, ""QUICK"" has C which is eliminated. So invalid.

- ""QUIRK"": but that's not a word.

- ""BRICK"": B, R, I, C, K -> but C is eliminated.

- ""PRICK"": P is eliminated.

- ""WRING"": W, R, I, N, G -> but N is eliminated.

- ""GRIMY"": G, R, I, M, Y -> but we have R at position 2? The pattern is _ _ _ R _, so position 2 must be a letter. In ""GRIMY"", R is at position 2, not 4. So that doesn't fit.

We need R at position 4.

Another idea: ""FERRY"" -> but E is eliminated and also R is at position 2 and 3? Not at 4.

""BERRY"": B, E, R, R, Y -> E eliminated and R at position 3? Not 4.

""DIRGE"": D, I, R, G, E -> E eliminated.

""VIRUS"": V, I, R, U, S -> S eliminated.

""LYRIC"": L, Y, R, I, C -> C eliminated.

""MYRRH"": M, Y, R, R, H -> R at position 3 and 4? Actually, position 4 is R. But we have two R's? And we don't know if there are two R's. But the word is M-Y-R-R-H. So positions: M(1), Y(2), R(3), R(4), H(5). But we have R at position 4, which is good. But we are testing M, Y, H and also the second R? But we don't know if there is a second R.

However, we are limited by the available letters. We must avoid the eliminated letters.

But note: we have not eliminated M, Y, H. So ""MYRRH"" is a valid word? Yes, but it has two R's. We don't know if the secret word has two R's. But that's acceptable.

But we are testing R at position 4 which we know is correct, and also we are testing M at position 1, Y at position 2, and H at position 5.

But we are also testing the second R at position 3. If the secret word has only one R, then the second R might be marked as absent? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicate R.

How about ""MURKY"": M, U, R, K, Y -> R is at position 3? Not 4.

""BURLY"": B, U, R, L, Y -> R at position 3? Not 4.

We need R at position 4.

Another try: ""HURRY"": H, U, R, R, Y -> R at position 3 and 4? Actually, position 3 is R, position 4 is R? The word is H-U-R-R-Y, so position 4 is R. But we have two R's. And we are testing H, U, Y.

But we have to avoid E, which we are.

But is ""HURRY"" a valid word? Yes.

However, we are testing the same letter twice. We might get less information.

Another word: ""FUROR"": F, U, R, O, R -> but O is eliminated (from guess2: O is not in the word). So invalid.

""LIRIP"": not a word.

""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> no R at position 4.

We need R at position 4.

Let me think: words ending with R? But that would be position 4? Actually, position 4 is the fourth letter. So we need a word with the fourth letter R.

Pattern: _ _ _ R _

So the word has the form: letter1, letter2, letter3, R, letter5.

Now, letter1, letter2, letter3, and letter5 must be from the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And the word must be valid.

Some possibilities:

- ""MIRTH"": but H is at position 5? And we have I at position 3. But the word is M-I-R-T-H? No, that's M-I-R-T-H? But we need R at position 4. Actually, ""MIRTH"" is M-I-R-T-H -> positions: M(1), I(2), R(3), T(4), H(5). So R is at position 3, not 4. So that doesn't work.

We need R at position 4.

How about:

- ""BIRTH"": B, I, R, T, H -> again, R at position 3.

- ""DIRGE"": D, I, R, G, E -> E eliminated.

- ""FIRIE"": not a word.

- ""GIRLY"": G, I, R, L, Y -> R at position 3.

- ""HORNY"": H, O, R, N, Y -> O and N eliminated.

- ""LIRIP"": not a word.

- ""MIRZA"": M, I, R, Z, A -> A eliminated.

- ""MIRTH"" is not correct because R is at 3.

Another idea: ""QUICK"" is invalid because of C.

""QUIRK"" is not a word.

""BRINK"": B, R, I, N, K -> N eliminated.

""BRISK"": B, R, I, S, K -> S eliminated.

""CRIMP"": C eliminated.

""DRUID"": D, R, U, I, D -> R at position 2? Not 4.

We need to focus on words with R at position 4.

How about ""CURRY"": C eliminated.

""BURGH"": B, U, R, G, H -> R at position 3? Not 4.

""WORDY"": W, O, R, D, Y -> O eliminated.

""FORUM"": F, O, R, U, M -> O eliminated.

""LYRUM"": L, Y, R, U, M -> R at position 3? Not 4.

Position 4 is the fourth letter. So we need words where the fourth letter is R.

Examples:

- ""BURQA"": not a common word, and A eliminated.

- ""DIRRA"": not a word.

- ""FURCA"": not a word.

- ""HURRA"": not a word.

- ""MURA"": not 5 letters.

- ""PUREA"": not a word.

- ""TURMA"": not a word.

- ""WORRY"": W, O, R, R, Y -> O eliminated.

- ""CURRY"": C eliminated.

- ""SURFY"": not a word.

- ""HURRY"": H, U, R, R, Y -> this is a word. And it uses H, U, Y and has R at position 4? Let's see: 
  Position 1: H
  Position 2: U
  Position 3: R
  Position 4: R? No, position 4 is the fourth letter. In ""HURRY"", the letters are:
  H (1), U (2), R (3), R (4), Y (5)

So yes, R is at position 4. And the letters are H, U, R, R, Y. We have R at position 3 and 4. But we know R is at position 4, so the R at position 3 might be redundant? But we are testing R at position 4, and also we are testing H, U, Y.

But we are testing the same letter twice. If the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 3 might be marked as absent? But we know R is at position 4, so the R at position 3 might be considered as not present? Actually, the feedback marks each letter independently. But if the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 3 would be marked as absent (x) and the R at position 4 is correct.

But we are testing U and H as well.

However, we are testing the same letter twice, which might not be efficient.

But we have to use the available letters.

Another word: ""MURKY"" -> M, U, R, K, Y -> R is at position 3? Not 4.

""URBAN"": U, R, B, A, N -> A and N eliminated.

""URBEX"": not a word.

""UMBRA"": U, M, B, R, A -> A eliminated.

""UMBRA"" is invalid.

""DUVET"": D, U, V, E, T -> E and T eliminated.

""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> P and S eliminated.

""QUADS"": Q, U, A, D, S -> A and S eliminated.

This is difficult.

Another possibility: ""LURID"": L, U, R, I, D -> R at position 3? Not 4.

""RUDDY"": R, U, D, D, Y -> R at position 1? Not 4.

We need to focus on words that have R at position 4.

How about ""AURUM"" -> A eliminated.

""CURUM"" -> C eliminated.

""DUVET"" -> eliminated letters.

Perhaps ""MURKY"" is not working.

Another idea: ""HURRY"" is one valid word. And it uses H, U, Y. But we are testing two R's.

But we have to consider that the secret word might have two R's? We don't know.

Alternatively, we can try ""GIRTH"": G, I, R, T, H -> T eliminated.

""birth"" is B-I-R-T-H -> R at position 3.

""RHYME"": R at position 1, but E and H? E is eliminated.

""WHIRL"": W, H, I, R, L -> R at position 4? 
  Position 1: W
  Position 2: H
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: R
  Position 5: L

Yes! So ""WHIRL"" is a word (meaning: to make whirled or moved in a spiral). And it uses W, H, I, L.

And the letters are W, H, I, L, and R at position 4.

We haven't tried W, H, I, L. And we avoid the eliminated letters.

So this is a good candidate.

Another word: ""SHIRK"": S eliminated.

""THIRL"": not a word.

""WHIRL"" is valid.

Another one: ""CHIRP"": C eliminated.

""MYRRH"": as before, but R at position 4? M(1), Y(2), R(3), R(4), H(5) -> yes, R at 4.

But ""MYRRH"" is not a common word. ""HURRY"" is more common.

But ""HURRY"" has two R's. We can try ""WHIRL"" which has only one R and four new letters.

""WHIRL"": 
  W at 1, H at 2, I at 3, L at 5.

If the secret word has R at position 4, then we get a check for R at position 4. And we test W, H, I, L.

If the secret word does not have R at position 4, then we get a dash for R at position 4? But we know R is in the word, and we have R at position 4. If the secret word has R at position 4, then we get a check. If not, then we get a dash and we know R must be at position 1,3, or 5? But we have position 3 as I and position 5 as L. So if R is not at 4, then we get a dash for R at position 4, and then we know R must be at 1,3, or 5. And we test W, H, I, L.

So ""WHIRL"" seems good.

Another candidate: ""MIRTH"" is not because R is at 3.

""GRIMY"": G, R, I, M, Y -> R at position 2? Not 4.

""DRUID"": R at 2.

""CRIMP"": C eliminated.

""WRING"": N eliminated.

""BRING"": N eliminated.

""FRISK"": F, R, I, S, K -> S eliminated.

""CRISP"": C and S eliminated.

""TRIPY"": T eliminated.

""VIPER"": V, I, P, E, R -> P and E eliminated.

""UDDER"": U, D, D, E, R -> E eliminated.

""DAILY"": A eliminated.

""GUILT"": G, U, I, L, T -> T eliminated.

""QUILT"": same.

""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> no R at position 4.

We need R at position 4.

Another word: ""CURVY"": C eliminated.

""LURCH"": L, U, R, C, H -> C eliminated.

""LYRCH"": not a word.

""MYRRH"": as before.

""YARNS"": Y, A, R, N, S -> A, N, S eliminated.

""YARKS"": same.

""YAWED"": Y, A, W, E, D -> A and E eliminated.

""YUCKS"": Y, U, C, K, S -> C and S eliminated.

""ZEBRA"": Z, E, B, R, A -> E and A eliminated.

""JUMPS"": P and S eliminated.

""QUADS"": A and S eliminated.

""QUAQU"": not 5 letters.

""QUICK"": C eliminated.

""QUIRK"": not a word.

""QUART"": A eliminated.

""QUART"" is 5 letters? Q-U-A-R-T, but A and T eliminated.

""QUASH"": S and A eliminated.

""QUASI"": not a word.

""QUAY"": not 5 letters.

""QUICK"" is out.

""QUILT"": Q, U, I, L, T -> T eliminated.

""QUINT"": Q, U, I, N, T -> N and T eliminated.

""QUIST"": not a word.

""QUIRL"": not a word.

""QUIRP"": not a word.

""QUICK"" is not.

Another idea: ""WHIRL"" is valid. Or ""WHIRL"" is valid.

""WHIRL"": W, H, I, R, L -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:I, 4:R, 5:L.

We can use this.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have R at position 4, and we are testing W, H, I, L.

If we get feedback that R is correct at position 4, then we know. If not, then R must be at 1,3, or 5.

Also, we test W, H, I, L.

Alternatively, we can try ""MURKY"": M, U, R, K, Y -> R at position 3? Not 4.

""MYRRH"": M, Y, R, R, H -> R at position 3 and 4. So if we put R at position 4, we might get a check for that one and a dash for the other? But we are testing two R's.

But ""MYRRH"" is not a common word. ""HURRY"" is more common.

But ""HURRY"" has two R's. We can try ""WHIRL"" which has only one R and four new letters.

Another word: ""DUVET"" -> eliminated.

""BEIGY"": not a word.

""DEARY"": D, E, A, R, Y -> E and A eliminated.

""HEART"": H, E, A, R, T -> E, A, T eliminated.

""HERON"": H, E, R, O, N -> E, O, N eliminated.

""HEROY"": not a word.

""MERIT"": M, E, R, I, T -> E and T eliminated.

""MERIT"" is out.

""MYTHS"": M, Y, T, H, S -> T and S eliminated.

""MYRRH"": M, Y, R, R, H -> this is a word. But we are testing M, Y, H and the two R's.

But we are testing R at position 3 and 4. We know position 4 is R, so if position 3 is R and it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know position 3 is not R, and we have information about M, Y, H.

But we are testing two R's, which might not be efficient.

Alternatively, ""WHIRL"" tests four new letters and one R (at position 4).

I think ""WHIRL"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: 
  Position 1: W
  Position 2: H
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: R (which we know is correct, so we expect a check for R at 4)
  Position 5: L

We are testing W, H, I, L and also confirming R at 4.

If the secret word has R at position 4, then we get a check for R. If not, we get a dash and then we know R must be at 1,3, or 5. And we get feedback on W, H, I, L.

Moreover, ""WHIRL"" is a valid English word.

So I will go with ""WHIRL"".

But note: we have to make sure that the word is in the dictionary. I believe ""whirl"" is a valid word.

Therefore, the next guess is ""WHIRL"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R is in the word but not in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""sport"")**: R is correct at position 4. S, P, O, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has **R in position 4** (pattern: `_ _ _ R _`).
- Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T** (cannot appear in the word).
- Remaining letters to test: **B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.
- Goal: Test new common letters while respecting the known R at position 4.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Choose a word that fits `_ _ _ R _` and uses only the remaining letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", R is at position 2, and it's marked as wrong position).
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and does not contain C, A, N, E.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter R (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the second (because in the first guess it was in position 2 and was wrong).
 2. Avoids the letters C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Since R is in the word, we can try to put R in a different position. Also, we know that the word does not have A, E, and also C and N.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible. We have eliminated A, E, and also C, N. So the remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but we avoid for now).

 We also know that the word has R, and we have 4 other letters to choose (from the alphabet without C, A, N, E).

 We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 A good second guess might be ""ROTLS"" but that's not a word. We need a valid 5-letter word.

 Let me think of words that have R and avoid C, A, N, E.

 Possible words: 
   ""ROILS"" (meaning: to agitate) -> but we don't know if O, I, L, S are in the word.
   ""ROUST"" (meaning: to drive out or disturb) -> R at position 1, but we know R is not at position 2? Actually, we don't know about position 1. In the first guess, R was at position 2 and was wrong, but it could be at position 1? However, we don't have information about position 1 yet.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess only tells us that R is in the word but not at position 2. It could be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 However, we also have to avoid the letters C, A, N, E.

 Let me try to come up with a word that has R and uses other common letters.

 Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should try to include as many of these as possible.

 A good candidate might be ""SPRIT"" but that's not a common word. Another idea: ""TRIES"" - but note that we have 5 letters and we want to avoid the known absent letters.

 However, we must avoid A, E, C, N.

 Let me think of words that have R and use common letters.

 Option 1: ""ROTLS"" is not a word. How about ""ROUST""? That's valid.

 But note: we have the letter U? We don't know about U. And we haven't tried S, T, L.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PRIOR"" but that has two R's? And we don't know if there are two R's. But the feedback for the first guess only showed one R? Actually, the feedback only marks the letters that are present. If there are two R's, then both would be marked? But in the first guess, we only had one R and it was marked as present (but wrong position). So the word has at least one R. It might have two.

 However, we don't have information about duplicates. So we can try a word with duplicate R? But we don't know.

 But to keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another candidate: ""ROOMy"" - but that has two O's and we don't know about O. Also, Y is at the end.

 However, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let me try ""ROUST"": 
   R at position 1 (which is a new position for R, so we can check if R is at position 1)
   O, U, S, T are new letters.

 But note: we know R is in the word, so if we put R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If it's not, then we know R must be in one of the other positions (3,4,5) and also we get information about O, U, S, T.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a position we haven't tried (like position 3,4,5) and also includes other common letters.

 Another idea: ""TRIOS"" - but that has T, R, I, O, S. But note: we have to avoid A, E, C, N. This word doesn't have those.

 However, we already know R is in the word, so we don't need to test R again? Actually, we do need to test R because we want to find its position. And we can test it in a new position.

 But note: in the first guess, R was at position 2. So we can try position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Let me try to choose a word that has R in a position that is not 2, and also includes other common letters.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 I think ""ROUST"" is a good candidate: 
   R at 1 (new position), O, U, S, T are all new.

 But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""ROUST"" is a valid English word.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RUSTS"" but that has duplicate S? And we don't know about S.

 Another option: ""ROILS"" (meaning: to agitate) -> R at 1, and then O, I, L, S.

 But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So we are safe.

 However, we might also consider that the word might have the letter R and we can test it in position 1.

 But let me check: if we put R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If it's not, then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5. And we also test O, U, S, T.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in position 3,4, or 5 and also includes other common letters.

 For example: 
   ""PARTY"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, E, C, N.

 So let me try ""DIRTY"": 
   D, I, R, T, Y. 
   R is at position 3. 
   This word avoids the forbidden letters.

 But note: we don't know if D, I, T, Y are in the word. And we are testing R at position 3.

 However, we also want to test more common letters. Let's compare:

 Option 1: ""ROUST"" -> tests R at 1, and letters O, U, S, T.
 Option 2: ""DIRTY"" -> tests R at 3, and letters D, I, T, Y.

 Both are valid. But ""ROUST"" uses more common letters? S and T are very common.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have S or T? We don't know.

 But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So the remaining common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

 I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice because it tests R in a new position (1) and also tests S, T, O, U.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 1, we might get:
   If R is at position 1: then we get a check for R.
   If not, then we get a dash for R (meaning it's in the word but not at position 1) and then we know R must be at 3,4, or 5.

 Also, we test O, U, S, T.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROTLS"" but that's not a word. How about ""ROILS""? 
   ""ROILS"" is a word (meaning: to agitate). It has R at 1, and then O, I, L, S.

 But note: we are testing the same letters as ""ROUST"" but in different order? Actually, ""ROILS"" has R at 1, O at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.

 However, we know that the secret word does not have A, E, C, N. So we can use ""ROILS"".

 But let me check: we have not tried O, I, L, S. And we are testing R at position 1.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a position that we haven't tried and also tests more common letters.

 Another candidate: ""SPORT"" -> S, P, O, R, T. But note: R is at position 4. This tests S, P, O, R, T. And we avoid the forbidden letters.

 However, we already know R is in the word, so we are testing S, P, O, T.

 But we are testing R at position 4. Also, we are testing S at position 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 5.

 This seems good.

 However, we must note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ""ROUST"" -> tests R at 1, and letters O, U, S, T.
 Option 2: ""SPORT"" -> tests R at 4, and letters S, P, O, T.

 Both are good. But ""SPORT"" tests more common letters? S, T, O are common.

 But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So the remaining common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

 I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it tests S, P, O, T and R at a new position (4). Also, it uses R at position 4 (which is one of the possibilities) and we get feedback on the other positions.

 However, we must be cautious: if the word has R at position 1, then in ""SPORT"" the R at position 4 would be marked as absent? Actually, no: the feedback marks each letter independently. But note: if the word has two R's, then if we put R in a position that is not present, it would be marked as dash if there is another R? Actually, the feedback is per letter occurrence. But we don't know if there are two R's.

 To avoid confusion, we might prefer a word without duplicate letters.

 So let me avoid duplicates.

 Therefore, I choose ""SPORT"" because it tests four new common letters (S, P, O, T) and R at position 4.

 But wait: we have to consider that the word might have R at position 1. So if we put R at position 4 and it is not correct, then we still don't know about position 1? Actually, we will know: if R is not at position 4, then we get a dash for R and we know R must be at 1,3, or 5. But we have tested position 4 and it was wrong, so then we can try position 1 in the next guess.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and also tests other common letters.

 How about ""RUSTS""? That has duplicate S. We don't want that.

 How about ""ROAST""? But A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So we cannot use A.

 How about ""ROBOT""? But B and T are new, but we have two O's? And we don't know about O. Also, we have to avoid A, E, C, N. This word doesn't have those, but it has two O's and two O's? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, O at 4, T at 5. But we are testing O twice? And we don't know if O is in the word.

 But we are testing R at position 1 and O at position 2? Also, we are testing B and T.

 However, we already know that the secret word does not have A, E, C, N. So we can use ""ROBOT"". But we are testing O twice? That might not be efficient.

 Alternatively, ""ROWDY"": R at 1, O at 2, W at 3, D at 4, Y at 5. This tests R at 1 and O at 2. But we don't test S or T.

 Since S and T are very common, I think including them is better.

 How about ""ROUST"" again? It tests R at 1, and also O, U, S, T.

 I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter R and we are testing it at position 1. If it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5.

 Also, we test O, U, S, T.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPORT"" to test R at position 4 and also test S, P, O, T.

 I think both are reasonable. Let me pick ""SPORT"" because it tests S, P, O, T and R at a new position.

 But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, N, E. ""SPORT"" does not contain any of these.

 So I will go with ""SPORT"".

 However, note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter R and we are testing it at position 4. If the R is at position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know R is at 1,3, or 5.

 Also, we get feedback on S, P, O, T.

 Let me write the guess: ""SPORT""

 But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 4, we might get:

   If R is at position 4: then we get a check for R.
   If R is not at position 4, then we get a dash for R (meaning it's in the word but not at position 4) and then we know R must be at 1,3, or 5.

 Also, we test S at position 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 5.

 We might get more information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and also tests other common letters. For example, ""ROBOT"" is not ideal because of duplicate O.

 Another candidate: ""RUSTY"" -> R at 1, U at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. This tests R at 1 and U, S, T, Y.

 But Y is less common.

 How about ""RISKY""? But that has S and K, but also I and Y. And R at 1.

 But we don't know if I is in the word.

 After considering, I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice.

 Let me check if ""SPORT"" is a valid word: yes.

 So I will guess ""SPORT"".

 But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any of the absent letters. We are not.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2.
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Include R (since it's confirmed in the word) but avoid position 2.
2. Exclude C, A, N, E.
3. Test new common letters to gather more information.

I chose ""SPORT"" because:
- R is placed in position 4 (a new position to test).
- It introduces four new common letters: S, P, O, T.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, A, N, E) and duplicates.
- If R is in position 4, it will be marked correct; if not, the feedback will confirm R must be in position 1, 3, or 5, while providing info on S, P, O, T.

<guess>sport</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) R(✓) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word but wrong position; specifically, not at position 2)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""sport""
  S: x (not in the word)
  P: x (not in the word)
  O: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct, meaning R is in the word and in position 4)
  T: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word has the letter R in the 4th position (since R was marked correct in ""sport"").
2. The secret word contains the letter R, and we now know it is at position 4.
3. The letters C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T are not in the secret word.

So the secret word has the form: _ _ _ R _

We have eliminated the letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T.

The remaining letters to consider are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word must have 5 letters, with R at position 4.

We need to choose a word that:
- Has R at position 4.
- Uses only letters from the remaining set (avoiding C,A,N,E,S,P,O,T).
- Tests new common letters to maximize information.

Common letters from the remaining set: L, I, D, U, M, H, G, B, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Possible words that fit the pattern _ _ _ R _ and use only the remaining letters:

Let's think of words:

- ""DIRTY"": but D, I, R, T, Y -> but T is eliminated (from guess2: T is not in the word). So invalid.

- ""BIRTH"": B, I, R, T, H -> T is eliminated. Invalid.

- ""MIRTH"": same issue.

- ""GIRTH"": same issue.

- ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> but A is eliminated. Invalid.

- ""HAIRY"": H, A, I, R, Y -> A eliminated.

- ""FAIRY"": F, A, I, R, Y -> A eliminated.

- ""BUILT"": B, U, I, L, T -> T eliminated.

- ""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> but we have R at position 4? The word is G-U-I-L-D, so R is missing. We need R at position 4.

We must have R at position 4.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ R _

Let me try to find words that fit this pattern and use only the remaining letters.

Possible words:

- ""QUICK"": but Q and K are still available? But note: we have eliminated C and K? Actually, we haven't eliminated K. But wait, ""QUICK"" has C which is eliminated. So invalid.

- ""QUIRK"": but that's not a word.

- ""BRICK"": B, R, I, C, K -> but C is eliminated.

- ""PRICK"": P is eliminated.

- ""WRING"": W, R, I, N, G -> but N is eliminated.

- ""GRIMY"": G, R, I, M, Y -> but we have R at position 2? The pattern is _ _ _ R _, so position 2 must be a letter. In ""GRIMY"", R is at position 2, not 4. So that doesn't fit.

We need R at position 4.

Another idea: ""FERRY"" -> but E is eliminated and also R is at position 2 and 3? Not at 4.

""BERRY"": B, E, R, R, Y -> E eliminated and R at position 3? Not 4.

""DIRGE"": D, I, R, G, E -> E eliminated.

""VIRUS"": V, I, R, U, S -> S eliminated.

""LYRIC"": L, Y, R, I, C -> C eliminated.

""MYRRH"": M, Y, R, R, H -> R at position 3 and 4? Actually, position 4 is R. But we have two R's? And we don't know if there are two R's. But the word is M-Y-R-R-H. So positions: M(1), Y(2), R(3), R(4), H(5). But we have R at position 4, which is good. But we are testing M, Y, H and also the second R? But we don't know if there is a second R.

However, we are limited by the available letters. We must avoid the eliminated letters.

But note: we have not eliminated M, Y, H. So ""MYRRH"" is a valid word? Yes, but it has two R's. We don't know if the secret word has two R's. But that's acceptable.

But we are testing R at position 4 which we know is correct, and also we are testing M at position 1, Y at position 2, and H at position 5.

But we are also testing the second R at position 3. If the secret word has only one R, then the second R might be marked as absent? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicate R.

How about ""MURKY"": M, U, R, K, Y -> R is at position 3? Not 4.

""BURLY"": B, U, R, L, Y -> R at position 3? Not 4.

We need R at position 4.

Another try: ""HURRY"": H, U, R, R, Y -> R at position 3 and 4? Actually, position 3 is R, position 4 is R? The word is H-U-R-R-Y, so position 4 is R. But we have two R's. And we are testing H, U, Y.

But we have to avoid E, which we are.

But is ""HURRY"" a valid word? Yes.

However, we are testing the same letter twice. We might get less information.

Another word: ""FUROR"": F, U, R, O, R -> but O is eliminated (from guess2: O is not in the word). So invalid.

""LIRIP"": not a word.

""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> no R at position 4.

We need R at position 4.

Let me think: words ending with R? But that would be position 4? Actually, position 4 is the fourth letter. So we need a word with the fourth letter R.

Pattern: _ _ _ R _

So the word has the form: letter1, letter2, letter3, R, letter5.

Now, letter1, letter2, letter3, and letter5 must be from the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And the word must be valid.

Some possibilities:

- ""MIRTH"": but H is at position 5? And we have I at position 3. But the word is M-I-R-T-H? No, that's M-I-R-T-H? But we need R at position 4. Actually, ""MIRTH"" is M-I-R-T-H -> positions: M(1), I(2), R(3), T(4), H(5). So R is at position 3, not 4. So that doesn't work.

We need R at position 4.

How about:

- ""BIRTH"": B, I, R, T, H -> again, R at position 3.

- ""DIRGE"": D, I, R, G, E -> E eliminated.

- ""FIRIE"": not a word.

- ""GIRLY"": G, I, R, L, Y -> R at position 3.

- ""HORNY"": H, O, R, N, Y -> O and N eliminated.

- ""LIRIP"": not a word.

- ""MIRZA"": M, I, R, Z, A -> A eliminated.

- ""MIRTH"" is not correct because R is at 3.

Another idea: ""QUICK"" is invalid because of C.

""QUIRK"" is not a word.

""BRINK"": B, R, I, N, K -> N eliminated.

""BRISK"": B, R, I, S, K -> S eliminated.

""CRIMP"": C eliminated.

""DRUID"": D, R, U, I, D -> R at position 2? Not 4.

We need to focus on words with R at position 4.

How about ""CURRY"": C eliminated.

""BURGH"": B, U, R, G, H -> R at position 3? Not 4.

""WORDY"": W, O, R, D, Y -> O eliminated.

""FORUM"": F, O, R, U, M -> O eliminated.

""LYRUM"": L, Y, R, U, M -> R at position 3? Not 4.

Position 4 is the fourth letter. So we need words where the fourth letter is R.

Examples:

- ""BURQA"": not a common word, and A eliminated.

- ""DIRRA"": not a word.

- ""FURCA"": not a word.

- ""HURRA"": not a word.

- ""MURA"": not 5 letters.

- ""PUREA"": not a word.

- ""TURMA"": not a word.

- ""WORRY"": W, O, R, R, Y -> O eliminated.

- ""CURRY"": C eliminated.

- ""SURFY"": not a word.

- ""HURRY"": H, U, R, R, Y -> this is a word. And it uses H, U, Y and has R at position 4? Let's see: 
  Position 1: H
  Position 2: U
  Position 3: R
  Position 4: R? No, position 4 is the fourth letter. In ""HURRY"", the letters are:
  H (1), U (2), R (3), R (4), Y (5)

So yes, R is at position 4. And the letters are H, U, R, R, Y. We have R at position 3 and 4. But we know R is at position 4, so the R at position 3 might be redundant? But we are testing R at position 4, and also we are testing H, U, Y.

But we are testing the same letter twice. If the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 3 might be marked as absent? But we know R is at position 4, so the R at position 3 might be considered as not present? Actually, the feedback marks each letter independently. But if the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 3 would be marked as absent (x) and the R at position 4 is correct.

But we are testing U and H as well.

However, we are testing the same letter twice, which might not be efficient.

But we have to use the available letters.

Another word: ""MURKY"" -> M, U, R, K, Y -> R is at position 3? Not 4.

""URBAN"": U, R, B, A, N -> A and N eliminated.

""URBEX"": not a word.

""UMBRA"": U, M, B, R, A -> A eliminated.

""UMBRA"" is invalid.

""DUVET"": D, U, V, E, T -> E and T eliminated.

""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> P and S eliminated.

""QUADS"": Q, U, A, D, S -> A and S eliminated.

This is difficult.

Another possibility: ""LURID"": L, U, R, I, D -> R at position 3? Not 4.

""RUDDY"": R, U, D, D, Y -> R at position 1? Not 4.

We need to focus on words that have R at position 4.

How about ""AURUM"" -> A eliminated.

""CURUM"" -> C eliminated.

""DUVET"" -> eliminated letters.

Perhaps ""MURKY"" is not working.

Another idea: ""HURRY"" is one valid word. And it uses H, U, Y. But we are testing two R's.

But we have to consider that the secret word might have two R's? We don't know.

Alternatively, we can try ""GIRTH"": G, I, R, T, H -> T eliminated.

""birth"" is B-I-R-T-H -> R at position 3.

""RHYME"": R at position 1, but E and H? E is eliminated.

""WHIRL"": W, H, I, R, L -> R at position 4? 
  Position 1: W
  Position 2: H
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: R
  Position 5: L

Yes! So ""WHIRL"" is a word (meaning: to make whirled or moved in a spiral). And it uses W, H, I, L.

And the letters are W, H, I, L, and R at position 4.

We haven't tried W, H, I, L. And we avoid the eliminated letters.

So this is a good candidate.

Another word: ""SHIRK"": S eliminated.

""THIRL"": not a word.

""WHIRL"" is valid.

Another one: ""CHIRP"": C eliminated.

""MYRRH"": as before, but R at position 4? M(1), Y(2), R(3), R(4), H(5) -> yes, R at 4.

But ""MYRRH"" is not a common word. ""HURRY"" is more common.

But ""HURRY"" has two R's. We can try ""WHIRL"" which has only one R and four new letters.

""WHIRL"": 
  W at 1, H at 2, I at 3, L at 5.

If the secret word has R at position 4, then we get a check for R at position 4. And we test W, H, I, L.

If the secret word does not have R at position 4, then we get a dash for R at position 4? But we know R is in the word, and we have R at position 4. If the secret word has R at position 4, then we get a check. If not, then we get a dash and we know R must be at position 1,3, or 5? But we have position 3 as I and position 5 as L. So if R is not at 4, then we get a dash for R at position 4, and then we know R must be at 1,3, or 5. And we test W, H, I, L.

So ""WHIRL"" seems good.

Another candidate: ""MIRTH"" is not because R is at 3.

""GRIMY"": G, R, I, M, Y -> R at position 2? Not 4.

""DRUID"": R at 2.

""CRIMP"": C eliminated.

""WRING"": N eliminated.

""BRING"": N eliminated.

""FRISK"": F, R, I, S, K -> S eliminated.

""CRISP"": C and S eliminated.

""TRIPY"": T eliminated.

""VIPER"": V, I, P, E, R -> P and E eliminated.

""UDDER"": U, D, D, E, R -> E eliminated.

""DAILY"": A eliminated.

""GUILT"": G, U, I, L, T -> T eliminated.

""QUILT"": same.

""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> no R at position 4.

We need R at position 4.

Another word: ""CURVY"": C eliminated.

""LURCH"": L, U, R, C, H -> C eliminated.

""LYRCH"": not a word.

""MYRRH"": as before.

""YARNS"": Y, A, R, N, S -> A, N, S eliminated.

""YARKS"": same.

""YAWED"": Y, A, W, E, D -> A and E eliminated.

""YUCKS"": Y, U, C, K, S -> C and S eliminated.

""ZEBRA"": Z, E, B, R, A -> E and A eliminated.

""JUMPS"": P and S eliminated.

""QUADS"": A and S eliminated.

""QUAQU"": not 5 letters.

""QUICK"": C eliminated.

""QUIRK"": not a word.

""QUART"": A eliminated.

""QUART"" is 5 letters? Q-U-A-R-T, but A and T eliminated.

""QUASH"": S and A eliminated.

""QUASI"": not a word.

""QUAY"": not 5 letters.

""QUICK"" is out.

""QUILT"": Q, U, I, L, T -> T eliminated.

""QUINT"": Q, U, I, N, T -> N and T eliminated.

""QUIST"": not a word.

""QUIRL"": not a word.

""QUIRP"": not a word.

""QUICK"" is not.

Another idea: ""WHIRL"" is valid. Or ""WHIRL"" is valid.

""WHIRL"": W, H, I, R, L -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:I, 4:R, 5:L.

We can use this.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have R at position 4, and we are testing W, H, I, L.

If we get feedback that R is correct at position 4, then we know. If not, then R must be at 1,3, or 5.

Also, we test W, H, I, L.

Alternatively, we can try ""MURKY"": M, U, R, K, Y -> R at position 3? Not 4.

""MYRRH"": M, Y, R, R, H -> R at position 3 and 4. So if we put R at position 4, we might get a check for that one and a dash for the other? But we are testing two R's.

But ""MYRRH"" is not a common word. ""HURRY"" is more common.

But ""HURRY"" has two R's. We can try ""WHIRL"" which has only one R and four new letters.

Another word: ""DUVET"" -> eliminated.

""BEIGY"": not a word.

""DEARY"": D, E, A, R, Y -> E and A eliminated.

""HEART"": H, E, A, R, T -> E, A, T eliminated.

""HERON"": H, E, R, O, N -> E, O, N eliminated.

""HEROY"": not a word.

""MERIT"": M, E, R, I, T -> E and T eliminated.

""MERIT"" is out.

""MYTHS"": M, Y, T, H, S -> T and S eliminated.

""MYRRH"": M, Y, R, R, H -> this is a word. But we are testing M, Y, H and the two R's.

But we are testing R at position 3 and 4. We know position 4 is R, so if position 3 is R and it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know position 3 is not R, and we have information about M, Y, H.

But we are testing two R's, which might not be efficient.

Alternatively, ""WHIRL"" tests four new letters and one R (at position 4).

I think ""WHIRL"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: 
  Position 1: W
  Position 2: H
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: R (which we know is correct, so we expect a check for R at 4)
  Position 5: L

We are testing W, H, I, L and also confirming R at 4.

If the secret word has R at position 4, then we get a check for R. If not, we get a dash and then we know R must be at 1,3, or 5. And we get feedback on W, H, I, L.

Moreover, ""WHIRL"" is a valid English word.

So I will go with ""WHIRL"".

But note: we have to make sure that the word is in the dictionary. I believe ""whirl"" is a valid word.

Therefore, the next guess is ""WHIRL"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R is in the word but not in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""sport"")**: R is correct at position 4. S, P, O, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has **R in position 4** (pattern: `_ _ _ R _`).
- Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T** (cannot appear in the word).
- Remaining letters to test: **B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.
- Goal: Test new common letters while respecting the known R at position 4.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Choose a word that fits `_ _ _ R _` and uses only the remaining letters.
- Prioritize high-frequency letters from the remaining set (e.g., L, I, D, U, M, H) to maximize information.
- Avoid eliminated letters and duplicate letters (since we have no evidence of duplicates yet).

After evaluating possible words, **""WHIRL""** is selected because:
- It fits the pattern: `W H I R L` → R is at position 4.
- It tests four new common letters: **W, H, I, L** (all high-frequency and not yet tested).
- It avoids eliminated letters and has no duplicates.
- ""WHIRL"" is a valid English word (meaning: to move in a spiral or whirling).

This guess will:
- Confirm R at position 4 (we already know it's correct, so feedback will show ✓ for R).
- Provide new information about W, H, I, L: 
  - If any are correct (✓), misplaced (-), or absent (x), we narrow down possibilities significantly.

How about ""ROUST""? That\'s valid.\n\n But note: we have the letter U? We don\'t know about U. And we haven\'t tried S, T, L.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PRIOR"" but that has two R\'s? And we don\'t know if there are two R\'s. But the feedback for the first guess only showed one R? Actually, the feedback only marks the letters that are present.

It might have two.\n\n However, we don\'t have information about duplicates. So we can try a word with duplicate R? But we don\'t know.\n\n But to keep it simple, let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Another candidate: ""ROOMy"" - but that has two O\'s and we don\'t know about O. Also, Y is at the end.\n\n However, we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let me try ""ROUST"": \n   R at position 1 (which is a new position for R, so we can check if R is at position 1)\n   O, U, S, T are new letters.\n\n But note: we know R is in the word, so if we put R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check.

But note: we have to avoid A, E, C, N. This word doesn\'t have those.\n\n However, we already know R is in the word, so we don\'t need to test R again? Actually, we do need to test R because we want to find its position. And we can test it in a new position.\n\n But note: in the first guess, R was at position 2. So we can try position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Let me try to choose a word that has R in a position that is not 2, and also includes other common letters.\n\n Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\n I think ""ROUST"" is a good candidate: \n   R at 1 (new position), O, U, S, T are all new.\n\n But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""ROUST"" is a valid English word.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RUSTS"" but that has duplicate S? And we don\'t know about S.\n\n Another option: ""ROILS"" (meaning: to agitate) -> R at 1, and then O, I, L, S.\n\n But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So we are safe.\n\n However, we might also consider that the word might have the letter R and we can test it in position 1.\n\n But let me check: if we put R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If it\'s not, then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5.

So we cannot use A.\n\n We must avoid A, E, C, N.\n\n So let me try ""DIRTY"": \n   D, I, R, T, Y. \n   R is at position 3. \n   This word avoids the forbidden letters.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if D, I, T, Y are in the word. And we are testing R at position 3.\n\n However, we also want to test more common letters. Let\'s compare:\n\n Option 1: ""ROUST"" -> tests R at 1, and letters O, U, S, T.\n Option 2: ""DIRTY"" -> tests R at 3, and letters D, I, T, Y.\n\n Both are valid. But ""ROUST"" uses more common letters? S and T are very common.\n\n However, we have to consider that the word might have S or T? We don\'t know.\n\n But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So the remaining common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.\n\n I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice because it tests R in a new position (1) and also tests S, T, O, U.\n\n But wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 1, we might get:\n   If R is at position 1: then we get a check for R.\n   If not, then we get a dash for R (meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 1) and then we know R must be at 3,4, or 5.\n\n Also, we test O, U, S, T.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROTLS"" but that\'s not a word. How about ""ROILS""? \n   ""ROILS"" is a word (meaning: to agitate). It has R at 1, and then O, I, L, S.\n\n But note: we are testing the same letters as ""ROUST"" but in different order? Actually, ""ROILS"" has R at 1, O at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.\n\n However, we know that the secret word does not have A, E, C, N. So we can use ""ROILS"".\n\n But let me check: we have not tried O, I, L, S. And we are testing R at position 1.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a position that we haven\'t tried and also tests more common letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""SPORT"" -> S, P, O, R, T. But note: R is at position 4. This tests S, P, O, R, T. And we avoid the forbidden letters.\n\n However, we already know R is in the word, so we are testing S, P, O, T.\n\n But we are testing R at position 4. Also, we are testing S at position 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 5.\n\n This seems good.\n\n However, we must note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n Option 1: ""ROUST"" -> tests R at 1, and letters O, U, S, T.\n Option 2: ""SPORT"" -> tests R at 4, and letters S, P, O, T.\n\n Both are good. But ""SPORT"" tests more common letters? S, T, O are common.\n\n But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So the remaining common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.\n\n I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it tests S, P, O, T and R at a new position (4). Also, it uses R at position 4 (which is one of the possibilities) and we get feedback on the other positions.\n\n However, we must be cautious: if the word has R at position 1, then in ""SPORT"" the R at position 4 would be marked as absent? Actually, no: the feedback marks each letter independently. But note: if the word has two R\'s, then if we put R in a position that is not present, it would be marked as dash if there is another R? Actually, the feedback is per letter occurrence. But we don\'t know if there are two R\'s.\n\n To avoid confusion, we might prefer a word without duplicate letters.\n\n So let me avoid duplicates.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""SPORT"" because it tests four new common letters (S, P, O, T) and R at position 4.\n\n But wait: we have to consider that the word might have R at position 1. So if we put R at position 4 and it is not correct, then we still don\'t know about position 1? Actually, we will know: if R is not at position 4, then we get a dash for R and we know R must be at 1,3, or 5. But we have tested position 4 and it was wrong, so then we can try position 1 in the next guess.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and also tests other common letters.\n\n How about ""RUSTS""? That has duplicate S. We don\'t want that.\n\n How about ""ROAST""? But A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So we cannot use A.\n\n How about ""ROBOT""? But B and T are new, but we have two O\'s? And we don\'t know about O. Also, we have to avoid A, E, C, N. This word doesn\'t have those, but it has two O\'s and two O\'s? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, O at 4, T at 5. But we are testing O twice? And we don\'t know if O is in the word.\n\n But we are testing R at position 1 and O at position 2? Also, we are testing B and T.\n\n However, we already know that the secret word does not have A, E, C, N. So we can use ""ROBOT"". But we are testing O twice? That might not be efficient.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROWDY"": R at 1, O at 2, W at 3, D at 4, Y at 5. This tests R at 1 and O at 2. But we don\'t test S or T.\n\n Since S and T are very common, I think including them is better.\n\n How about ""ROUST"" again? It tests R at 1, and also O, U, S, T.\n\n I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice.\n\n But note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter R and we are testing it at position 1. If it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5.\n\n Also, we test O, U, S, T.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""SPORT"" to test R at position 4 and also test S, P, O, T.\n\n I think both are reasonable. Let me pick ""SPORT"" because it tests S, P, O, T and R at a new position.\n\n But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, N, E. ""SPORT"" does not contain any of these.\n\n So I will go with ""SPORT"".\n\n However, note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter R and we are testing it at position 4. If the R is at position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know R is at 1,3, or 5.\n\n Also, we get feedback on S, P, O, T.\n\n Let me write the guess: ""SPORT""\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 4, we might get:\n\n   If R is at position 4: then we get a check for R.\n   If R is not at position 4, then we get a dash for R (meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 4) and then we know R must be at 1,3, or 5.\n\n Also, we test S at position 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 5.\n\n We might get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and also tests other common letters. For example, ""ROBOT"" is not ideal because of duplicate O.\n\n Another candidate: ""RUSTY"" -> R at 1, U at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. This tests R at 1 and U, S, T, Y.\n\n But Y is less common.\n\n How about ""RISKY""? But that has S and K, but also I and Y. And R at 1.\n\n But we don\'t know if I is in the word.\n\n After considering, I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice.\n\n Let me check if ""SPORT"" is a valid word: yes.\n\n So I will guess ""SPORT"".\n\n But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any of the absent letters. We are not.\n\n Therefore, the next guess is ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- R is in the secret word but not in position 2.\n- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.\n\nFor the next guess, I need to:\n1. Include R (since it\'s confirmed in the word) but avoid position 2.\n2. Exclude C, A, N, E.\n3. Test new common letters to gather more information.\n\nI chose ""SPORT"" because:\n- R is placed in position 4 (a new position to test).\n- It introduces four new common letters: S, P, O, T.\n- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, A, N, E) and duplicates.\n- If R is in position 4, it will be marked correct; if not, the feedback will confirm R must be in position 1, 3, or 5, while providing info on S, P, O, T.\n\n<guess>sport</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) R(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in the word)\n  R: - (in the word but wrong position; specifically, not at position 2)\n  A: x (not in the word)\n  N: x (not in the word)\n  E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""sport""\n  S: x (not in the word)\n  P: x (not in the word)\n  O: x (not in the word)\n  R: ✓ (correct, meaning R is in the word and in position 4)\n  T: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n\n1.

The pattern is _ _ _ R _, so position 2 must be a letter. In ""GRIMY"", R is at position 2, not 4. So that doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe need R at position 4.\n\nAnother idea: ""FERRY"" -> but E is eliminated and also R is at position 2 and 3? Not at 4.\n\n""BERRY"": B, E, R, R, Y -> E eliminated and R at position 3? Not 4.\n\n""DIRGE"": D, I, R, G, E -> E eliminated.\n\n""VIRUS"": V, I, R, U, S -> S eliminated.\n\n""LYRIC"": L, Y, R, I, C -> C eliminated.\n\n""MYRRH"": M, Y, R, R, H -> R at position 3 and 4? Actually, position 4 is R. But we have two R\'s? And we don\'t know if there are two R\'s. But the word is M-Y-R-R-H. So positions: M(1), Y(2), R(3), R(4), H(5). But we have R at position 4, which is good. But we are testing M, Y, H and also the second R? But we don\'t know if there is a second R.\n\nHowever, we are limited by the available letters. We must avoid the eliminated letters.\n\nBut note: we have not eliminated M, Y, H. So ""MYRRH"" is a valid word? Yes, but it has two R\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has two R\'s. But that\'s acceptable.\n\nBut we are testing R at position 4 which we know is correct, and also we are testing M at position 1, Y at position 2, and H at position 5.\n\nBut we are also testing the second R at position 3. If the secret word has only one R, then the second R might be marked as absent? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word without duplicate R.\n\nHow about ""MURKY"": M, U, R, K, Y -> R is at position 3? Not 4.\n\n""BURLY"": B, U, R, L, Y -> R at position 3? Not 4.\n\nWe need R at position 4.\n\nAnother try: ""HURRY"": H, U, R, R, Y -> R at position 3 and 4? Actually, position 3 is R, position 4 is R? The word is H-U-R-R-Y, so position 4 is R. But we have two R\'s. And we are testing H, U, Y.\n\nBut we have to avoid E, which we are.\n\nBut is ""HURRY"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nHowever, we are testing the same letter twice. We might get less information.\n\nAnother word: ""FUROR"": F, U, R, O, R -> but O is eliminated (from guess2: O is not in the word). So invalid.\n\n""LIRIP"": not a word.\n\n""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> no R at position 4.\n\nWe need R at position 4.\n\nLet me think: words ending with R? But that would be position 4? Actually, position 4 is the fourth letter. So we need a word with the fourth letter R.\n\nPattern: _ _ _ R _\n\nSo the word has the form: letter1, letter2, letter3, R, letter5.\n\nNow, letter1, letter2, letter3, and letter5 must be from the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nAnd the word must be valid.\n\nSome possibilities:\n\n- ""MIRTH"": but H is at position 5? And we have I at position 3. But the word is M-I-R-T-H? No, that\'s M-I-R-T-H? But we need R at position 4. Actually, ""MIRTH"" is M-I-R-T-H -> positions: M(1), I(2), R(3), T(4), H(5). So R is at position 3, not 4. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe need R at position 4.\n\nHow about:\n\n- ""BIRTH"": B, I, R, T, H -> again, R at position 3.\n\n- ""DIRGE"": D, I, R, G, E -> E eliminated.\n\n- ""FIRIE"": not a word.\n\n- ""GIRLY"": G, I, R, L, Y -> R at position 3.\n\n- ""HORNY"": H, O, R, N, Y -> O and N eliminated.\n\n- ""LIRIP"": not a word.\n\n- ""MIRZA"": M, I, R, Z, A -> A eliminated.\n\n- ""MIRTH"" is not correct because R is at 3.\n\nAnother idea: ""QUICK"" is invalid because of C.\n\n""QUIRK"" is not a word.\n\n""BRINK"": B, R, I, N, K -> N eliminated.\n\n""BRISK"": B, R, I, S, K -> S eliminated.\n\n""CRIMP"": C eliminated.\n\n""DRUID"": D, R, U, I, D -> R at position 2?

And it uses H, U, Y and has R at position 4? Let\'s see: \n  Position 1: H\n  Position 2: U\n  Position 3: R\n  Position 4: R? No, position 4 is the fourth letter. In ""HURRY"", the letters are:\n  H (1), U (2), R (3), R (4), Y (5)\n\nSo yes, R is at position 4. And the letters are H, U, R, R, Y. We have R at position 3 and 4. But we know R is at position 4, so the R at position 3 might be redundant? But we are testing R at position 4, and also we are testing H, U, Y.\n\nBut we are testing the same letter twice. If the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 3 might be marked as absent? But we know R is at position 4, so the R at position 3 might be considered as not present? Actually, the feedback marks each letter independently. But if the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 3 would be marked as absent (x) and the R at position 4 is correct.\n\nBut we are testing U and H as well.\n\nHowever, we are testing the same letter twice, which might not be efficient.\n\nBut we have to use the available letters.\n\nAnother word: ""MURKY"" -> M, U, R, K, Y -> R is at position 3? Not 4.\n\n""URBAN"": U, R, B, A, N -> A and N eliminated.\n\n""URBEX"": not a word.\n\n""UMBRA"": U, M, B, R, A -> A eliminated.\n\n""UMBRA"" is invalid.\n\n""DUVET"": D, U, V, E, T -> E and T eliminated.\n\n""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> P and S eliminated.\n\n""QUADS"": Q, U, A, D, S -> A and S eliminated.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nAnother possibility: ""LURID"": L, U, R, I, D -> R at position 3?

And it uses H, U, Y. But we are testing two R\'s.\n\nBut we have to consider that the secret word might have two R\'s? We don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""GIRTH"": G, I, R, T, H -> T eliminated.\n\n""birth"" is B-I-R-T-H -> R at position 3.\n\n""RHYME"": R at position 1, but E and H? E is eliminated.\n\n""WHIRL"": W, H, I, R, L -> R at position 4? \n  Position 1: W\n  Position 2: H\n  Position 3: I\n  Position 4: R\n  Position 5: L\n\nYes! So ""WHIRL"" is a word (meaning: to make whirled or moved in a spiral). And it uses W, H, I, L.\n\nAnd the letters are W, H, I, L, and R at position 4.\n\nWe haven\'t tried W, H, I, L. And we avoid the eliminated letters.\n\nSo this is a good candidate.\n\nAnother word: ""SHIRK"": S eliminated.\n\n""THIRL"": not a word.\n\n""WHIRL"" is valid.\n\nAnother one: ""CHIRP"": C eliminated.\n\n""MYRRH"": as before, but R at position 4? M(1), Y(2), R(3), R(4), H(5) -> yes, R at 4.\n\nBut ""MYRRH"" is not a common word. ""HURRY"" is more common.\n\nBut ""HURRY"" has two R\'s. We can try ""WHIRL"" which has only one R and four new letters.\n\n""WHIRL"": \n  W at 1, H at 2, I at 3, L at 5.\n\nIf the secret word has R at position 4, then we get a check for R at position 4. And we test W, H, I, L.\n\nIf the secret word does not have R at position 4, then we get a dash for R at position 4? But we know R is in the word, and we have R at position 4. If the secret word has R at position 4, then we get a check. If not, then we get a dash and we know R must be at position 1,3, or 5? But we have position 3 as I and position 5 as L. So if R is not at 4, then we get a dash for R at position 4, and then we know R must be at 1,3, or 5.

Or ""WHIRL"" is valid.\n\n""WHIRL"": W, H, I, R, L -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:I, 4:R, 5:L.\n\nWe can use this.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the secret word might have R at position 4, and we are testing W, H, I, L.\n\nIf we get feedback that R is correct at position 4, then we know. If not, then R must be at 1,3, or 5.\n\nAlso, we test W, H, I, L.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""MURKY"": M, U, R, K, Y -> R at position 3? Not 4.\n\n""MYRRH"": M, Y, R, R, H -> R at position 3 and 4. So if we put R at position 4, we might get a check for that one and a dash for the other? But we are testing two R\'s.\n\nBut ""MYRRH"" is not a common word. ""HURRY"" is more common.\n\nBut ""HURRY"" has two R\'s. We can try ""WHIRL"" which has only one R and four new letters.\n\nAnother word: ""DUVET"" -> eliminated.\n\n""BEIGY"": not a word.\n\n""DEARY"": D, E, A, R, Y -> E and A eliminated.\n\n""HEART"": H, E, A, R, T -> E, A, T eliminated.\n\n""HERON"": H, E, R, O, N -> E, O, N eliminated.\n\n""HEROY"": not a word.\n\n""MERIT"": M, E, R, I, T -> E and T eliminated.\n\n""MERIT"" is out.\n\n""MYTHS"": M, Y, T, H, S -> T and S eliminated.\n\n""MYRRH"": M, Y, R, R, H -> this is a word.

If not, we get a dash and then we know position 3 is not R, and we have information about M, Y, H.\n\nBut we are testing two R\'s, which might not be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, ""WHIRL"" tests four new letters and one R (at position 4).\n\nI think ""WHIRL"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm: \n  Position 1: W\n  Position 2: H\n  Position 3: I\n  Position 4: R (which we know is correct, so we expect a check for R at 4)\n  Position 5: L\n\nWe are testing W, H, I, L and also confirming R at 4.\n\nIf the secret word has R at position 4, then we get a check for R. If not, we get a dash and then we know R must be at 1,3, or 5. And we get feedback on W, H, I, L.\n\nMoreover, ""WHIRL"" is a valid English word.\n\nSo I will go with ""WHIRL"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that the word is in the dictionary. I believe ""whirl"" is a valid word.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""WHIRL"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R is in the word but not in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (""sport"")**: R is correct at position 4. S, P, O, T are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word has **R in position 4** (pattern: `_ _ _ R _`).\n- Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T** (cannot appear in the word).\n- Remaining letters to test: **B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.\n- Goal: Test new common letters while respecting the known R at position 4.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Choose a word that fits `_ _ _ R _` and uses only the remaining letters.\n- Prioritize high-frequency letters from the remaining set (e.g., L, I, D, U, M, H) to maximize information.\n- Avoid eliminated letters and duplicate letters (since we have no evidence of duplicates yet).\n\nAfter evaluating possible words, **""WHIRL""** is selected because:\n- It fits the pattern: `W H I R L` → R is at position 4.\n- It tests four new common letters: **W, H, I, L** (all high-frequency and not yet tested).\n- It avoids eliminated letters and has no duplicates.\n- ""WHIRL"" is a valid English word (meaning: to move in a spiral or whirling).\n\nThis guess will:\n- Confirm R at position 4 (we already know it\'s correct, so feedback will show ✓ for R).\n- Provide new information about W, H, I, L: \n  - If any are correct (✓), misplaced (-), or absent (x), we narrow down possibilities significantly.\n\n<guess>whirl</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) R(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: whirl -> FEEDBACK: W(x) H(x) I(-) R(✓) L(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word but wrong position; specifically, not at position 2)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""sport""
  S: x (not in the word)
  P: x (not in the word)
  O: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct, so R is at position 4)
  T: x (not in the word)

Guess 3: ""whirl""
  W: x (not in the word)
  H: x (not in the word)
  I: - (in the word but not at position 3)
  R: ✓ (correct, position 4)
  L: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word has R at position 4: so the pattern is _ _ _ R _
2. The secret word contains the letter I, but not at position 3 (because in ""whirl"", I was at position 3 and marked as wrong position). So I must be at position 1, 2, or 5.
3. The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T, W, H, L. (We have eliminated 10 letters: C,A,N,E,S,P,O,T,W,H,L)

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

But note: we know I is in the word, so we must include I in the next guess, but not at position 3.

Also, we have to avoid the eliminated letters.

Now, the word must have I at position 1, 2, or 5.

We also have R at position 4.

We need to form a 5-letter word that has R at position 4 and I at either 1, 2, or 5.

Let's consider the possibilities:

Option 1: I at position 1 -> pattern: I _ _ R _
Option 2: I at position 2 -> pattern: _ I _ R _
Option 3: I at position 5 -> pattern: _ _ _ R I

We must choose a word that fits one of these and uses only the remaining letters.

We have to pick from the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z. But note I is already used in the word, but it can be repeated? We don't know, but we haven't seen any duplicate so far.

But we can try to avoid duplicates to get more information.

Let's try to find words for each option:

Option 1: I at 1 -> ""I _ _ R _""
  Possible words: 
    ""ICKER"" -> but C and K? C is eliminated. 
    ""IDLER"": I, D, L, E, R -> L and E eliminated. 
    ""IGLOO"": O and L eliminated. 
    ""IMBUE"": I, M, B, U, E -> E eliminated. 
    ""IMPED"": I, M, P, E, D -> P and E eliminated.

  It's hard to find a word with I at 1 and the remaining letters.

Option 2: I at 2 -> pattern: _ I _ R _
  Possible words:
    ""BIKER"": B, I, K, E, R -> E eliminated.
    ""DIVER"": D, I, V, E, R -> E eliminated.
    ""FILER"": F, I, L, E, R -> L and E eliminated.
    ""GIVER"": G, I, V, E, R -> E eliminated.
    ""MIXER"": M, I, X, E, R -> E eliminated.
    ""NITER"": N eliminated.

  We need to avoid E. So how about ""VIXEN""? But X and E? E eliminated.

  ""DIXY"": D, I, X, Y, Y -> but we need R at position 4? This word doesn't have R. We must have R at position 4.

  So the word must end with R? No, position 4 is R, so the last letter is position 5.

  Pattern: _ I _ R _

  How about ""BIRCH"": B, I, R, C, H -> C and H eliminated? C from guess1, H from guess3.

  ""DIREX"": not a word.

  ""FILMY"": F, I, L, M, Y -> L eliminated.

  ""GIPSY"": G, I, P, S, Y -> P and S eliminated.

  ""JIVED"": J, I, V, E, D -> E eliminated.

  ""KITED"": K, I, T, E, D -> T and E eliminated.

  ""MILKY"": M, I, L, K, Y -> L eliminated.

  ""NIKER"": N eliminated.

  ""RIVET"": R, I, V, E, T -> R at position 1? Not 2. And E and T eliminated.

  It's hard.

Option 3: I at 5 -> pattern: _ _ _ R I
  Possible words:
    ""AVRI"": not a word.
    ""BARMI"": not a word.
    ""BERXI"": not a word.
    ""BURXI"": not a word.
    ""CURXI"": C eliminated.
    ""DERXI"": E eliminated.
    ""FERMI"": F, E, R, M, I -> E eliminated.
    ""GORMI"": O eliminated.
    ""JERKI"": E eliminated.
    ""KARMI"": A eliminated.
    ""LarVI"": L eliminated.
    ""MARVI"": A eliminated.
    ""Narco"": N and C eliminated.
    ""Parch"": P and A and C eliminated.
    ""TABI"": T and A eliminated.
    ""Urdor"": O and R? But R is at position 4, and we have another R? We don't know if there is a second R. But in ""Urdor"", we have U, R, D, O, R -> O eliminated and duplicate R.

  How about ""MURKY"" but that has U and Y, but no I? We must have I at position 5.

  Pattern: _ _ _ R I

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 06 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", R is at position 2, and it's marked as wrong position).
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and does not contain C, A, N, E.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter R (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the second (because in the first guess it was in position 2 and was wrong).
 2. Avoids the letters C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Since R is in the word, we can try to put R in a different position. Also, we know that the word does not have A, E, and also C and N.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible. We have eliminated A, E, and also C, N. So the remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but we avoid for now).

 We also know that the word has R, and we have 4 other letters to choose (from the alphabet without C, A, N, E).

 We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 A good second guess might be ""ROTLS"" but that's not a word. We need a valid 5-letter word.

 Let me think of words that have R and avoid C, A, N, E.

 Possible words: 
   ""ROILS"" (meaning: to agitate) -> but we don't know if O, I, L, S are in the word.
   ""ROUST"" (meaning: to drive out or disturb) -> R at position 1, but we know R is not at position 2? Actually, we don't know about position 1. In the first guess, R was at position 2 and was wrong, but it could be at position 1? However, we don't have information about position 1 yet.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess only tells us that R is in the word but not at position 2. It could be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 However, we also have to avoid the letters C, A, N, E.

 Let me try to come up with a word that has R and uses other common letters.

 Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should try to include as many of these as possible.

 A good candidate might be ""SPRIT"" but that's not a common word. Another idea: ""TRIES"" - but note that we have 5 letters and we want to avoid the known absent letters.

 However, we must avoid A, E, C, N.

 Let me think of words that have R and use common letters.

 Option 1: ""ROTLS"" is not a word. How about ""ROUST""? That's valid.

 But note: we have the letter U? We don't know about U. And we haven't tried S, T, L.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PRIOR"" but that has two R's? And we don't know if there are two R's. But the feedback for the first guess only showed one R? Actually, the feedback only marks the letters that are present. If there are two R's, then both would be marked? But in the first guess, we only had one R and it was marked as present (but wrong position). So the word has at least one R. It might have two.

 However, we don't have information about duplicates. So we can try a word with duplicate R? But we don't know.

 But to keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another candidate: ""ROOMy"" - but that has two O's and we don't know about O. Also, Y is at the end.

 However, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let me try ""ROUST"": 
   R at position 1 (which is a new position for R, so we can check if R is at position 1)
   O, U, S, T are new letters.

 But note: we know R is in the word, so if we put R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If it's not, then we know R must be in one of the other positions (3,4,5) and also we get information about O, U, S, T.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a position we haven't tried (like position 3,4,5) and also includes other common letters.

 Another idea: ""TRIOS"" - but that has T, R, I, O, S. But note: we have to avoid A, E, C, N. This word doesn't have those.

 However, we already know R is in the word, so we don't need to test R again? Actually, we do need to test R because we want to find its position. And we can test it in a new position.

 But note: in the first guess, R was at position 2. So we can try position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Let me try to choose a word that has R in a position that is not 2, and also includes other common letters.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 I think ""ROUST"" is a good candidate: 
   R at 1 (new position), O, U, S, T are all new.

 But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""ROUST"" is a valid English word.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RUSTS"" but that has duplicate S? And we don't know about S.

 Another option: ""ROILS"" (meaning: to agitate) -> R at 1, and then O, I, L, S.

 But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So we are safe.

 However, we might also consider that the word might have the letter R and we can test it in position 1.

 But let me check: if we put R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If it's not, then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5. And we also test O, U, S, T.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in position 3,4, or 5 and also includes other common letters.

 For example: 
   ""PARTY"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, E, C, N.

 So let me try ""DIRTY"": 
   D, I, R, T, Y. 
   R is at position 3. 
   This word avoids the forbidden letters.

 But note: we don't know if D, I, T, Y are in the word. And we are testing R at position 3.

 However, we also want to test more common letters. Let's compare:

 Option 1: ""ROUST"" -> tests R at 1, and letters O, U, S, T.
 Option 2: ""DIRTY"" -> tests R at 3, and letters D, I, T, Y.

 Both are valid. But ""ROUST"" uses more common letters? S and T are very common.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have S or T? We don't know.

 But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So the remaining common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

 I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice because it tests R in a new position (1) and also tests S, T, O, U.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 1, we might get:
   If R is at position 1: then we get a check for R.
   If not, then we get a dash for R (meaning it's in the word but not at position 1) and then we know R must be at 3,4, or 5.

 Also, we test O, U, S, T.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROTLS"" but that's not a word. How about ""ROILS""? 
   ""ROILS"" is a word (meaning: to agitate). It has R at 1, and then O, I, L, S.

 But note: we are testing the same letters as ""ROUST"" but in different order? Actually, ""ROILS"" has R at 1, O at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.

 However, we know that the secret word does not have A, E, C, N. So we can use ""ROILS"".

 But let me check: we have not tried O, I, L, S. And we are testing R at position 1.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a position that we haven't tried and also tests more common letters.

 Another candidate: ""SPORT"" -> S, P, O, R, T. But note: R is at position 4. This tests S, P, O, R, T. And we avoid the forbidden letters.

 However, we already know R is in the word, so we are testing S, P, O, T.

 But we are testing R at position 4. Also, we are testing S at position 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 5.

 This seems good.

 However, we must note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ""ROUST"" -> tests R at 1, and letters O, U, S, T.
 Option 2: ""SPORT"" -> tests R at 4, and letters S, P, O, T.

 Both are good. But ""SPORT"" tests more common letters? S, T, O are common.

 But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So the remaining common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

 I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it tests S, P, O, T and R at a new position (4). Also, it uses R at position 4 (which is one of the possibilities) and we get feedback on the other positions.

 However, we must be cautious: if the word has R at position 1, then in ""SPORT"" the R at position 4 would be marked as absent? Actually, no: the feedback marks each letter independently. But note: if the word has two R's, then if we put R in a position that is not present, it would be marked as dash if there is another R? Actually, the feedback is per letter occurrence. But we don't know if there are two R's.

 To avoid confusion, we might prefer a word without duplicate letters.

 So let me avoid duplicates.

 Therefore, I choose ""SPORT"" because it tests four new common letters (S, P, O, T) and R at position 4.

 But wait: we have to consider that the word might have R at position 1. So if we put R at position 4 and it is not correct, then we still don't know about position 1? Actually, we will know: if R is not at position 4, then we get a dash for R and we know R must be at 1,3, or 5. But we have tested position 4 and it was wrong, so then we can try position 1 in the next guess.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and also tests other common letters.

 How about ""RUSTS""? That has duplicate S. We don't want that.

 How about ""ROAST""? But A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So we cannot use A.

 How about ""ROBOT""? But B and T are new, but we have two O's? And we don't know about O. Also, we have to avoid A, E, C, N. This word doesn't have those, but it has two O's and two O's? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, O at 4, T at 5. But we are testing O twice? And we don't know if O is in the word.

 But we are testing R at position 1 and O at position 2? Also, we are testing B and T.

 However, we already know that the secret word does not have A, E, C, N. So we can use ""ROBOT"". But we are testing O twice? That might not be efficient.

 Alternatively, ""ROWDY"": R at 1, O at 2, W at 3, D at 4, Y at 5. This tests R at 1 and O at 2. But we don't test S or T.

 Since S and T are very common, I think including them is better.

 How about ""ROUST"" again? It tests R at 1, and also O, U, S, T.

 I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter R and we are testing it at position 1. If it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5.

 Also, we test O, U, S, T.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPORT"" to test R at position 4 and also test S, P, O, T.

 I think both are reasonable. Let me pick ""SPORT"" because it tests S, P, O, T and R at a new position.

 But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, N, E. ""SPORT"" does not contain any of these.

 So I will go with ""SPORT"".

 However, note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter R and we are testing it at position 4. If the R is at position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know R is at 1,3, or 5.

 Also, we get feedback on S, P, O, T.

 Let me write the guess: ""SPORT""

 But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 4, we might get:

   If R is at position 4: then we get a check for R.
   If R is not at position 4, then we get a dash for R (meaning it's in the word but not at position 4) and then we know R must be at 1,3, or 5.

 Also, we test S at position 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 5.

 We might get more information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and also tests other common letters. For example, ""ROBOT"" is not ideal because of duplicate O.

 Another candidate: ""RUSTY"" -> R at 1, U at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. This tests R at 1 and U, S, T, Y.

 But Y is less common.

 How about ""RISKY""? But that has S and K, but also I and Y. And R at 1.

 But we don't know if I is in the word.

 After considering, I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice.

 Let me check if ""SPORT"" is a valid word: yes.

 So I will guess ""SPORT"".

 But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any of the absent letters. We are not.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2.
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Include R (since it's confirmed in the word) but avoid position 2.
2. Exclude C, A, N, E.
3. Test new common letters to gather more information.

I chose ""SPORT"" because:
- R is placed in position 4 (a new position to test).
- It introduces four new common letters: S, P, O, T.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, A, N, E) and duplicates.
- If R is in position 4, it will be marked correct; if not, the feedback will confirm R must be in position 1, 3, or 5, while providing info on S, P, O, T.

<guess>sport</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) R(✓) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word but wrong position; specifically, not at position 2)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""sport""
  S: x (not in the word)
  P: x (not in the word)
  O: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct, meaning R is in the word and in position 4)
  T: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word has the letter R in the 4th position (since R was marked correct in ""sport"").
2. The secret word contains the letter R, and we now know it is at position 4.
3. The letters C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T are not in the secret word.

So the secret word has the form: _ _ _ R _

We have eliminated the letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T.

The remaining letters to consider are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word must have 5 letters, with R at position 4.

We need to choose a word that:
- Has R at position 4.
- Uses only letters from the remaining set (avoiding C,A,N,E,S,P,O,T).
- Tests new common letters to maximize information.

Common letters from the remaining set: L, I, D, U, M, H, G, B, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Possible words that fit the pattern _ _ _ R _ and use only the remaining letters:

Let's think of words:

- ""DIRTY"": but D, I, R, T, Y -> but T is eliminated (from guess2: T is not in the word). So invalid.

- ""BIRTH"": B, I, R, T, H -> T is eliminated. Invalid.

- ""MIRTH"": same issue.

- ""GIRTH"": same issue.

- ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> but A is eliminated. Invalid.

- ""HAIRY"": H, A, I, R, Y -> A eliminated.

- ""FAIRY"": F, A, I, R, Y -> A eliminated.

- ""BUILT"": B, U, I, L, T -> T eliminated.

- ""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> but we have R at position 4? The word is G-U-I-L-D, so R is missing. We need R at position 4.

We must have R at position 4.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ R _

Let me try to find words that fit this pattern and use only the remaining letters.

Possible words:

- ""QUICK"": but Q and K are still available? But note: we have eliminated C and K? Actually, we haven't eliminated K. But wait, ""QUICK"" has C which is eliminated. So invalid.

- ""QUIRK"": but that's not a word.

- ""BRICK"": B, R, I, C, K -> but C is eliminated.

- ""PRICK"": P is eliminated.

- ""WRING"": W, R, I, N, G -> but N is eliminated.

- ""GRIMY"": G, R, I, M, Y -> but we have R at position 2? The pattern is _ _ _ R _, so position 2 must be a letter. In ""GRIMY"", R is at position 2, not 4. So that doesn't fit.

We need R at position 4.

Another idea: ""FERRY"" -> but E is eliminated and also R is at position 2 and 3? Not at 4.

""BERRY"": B, E, R, R, Y -> E eliminated and R at position 3? Not 4.

""DIRGE"": D, I, R, G, E -> E eliminated.

""VIRUS"": V, I, R, U, S -> S eliminated.

""LYRIC"": L, Y, R, I, C -> C eliminated.

""MYRRH"": M, Y, R, R, H -> R at position 3 and 4? Actually, position 4 is R. But we have two R's? And we don't know if there are two R's. But the word is M-Y-R-R-H. So positions: M(1), Y(2), R(3), R(4), H(5). But we have R at position 4, which is good. But we are testing M, Y, H and also the second R? But we don't know if there is a second R.

However, we are limited by the available letters. We must avoid the eliminated letters.

But note: we have not eliminated M, Y, H. So ""MYRRH"" is a valid word? Yes, but it has two R's. We don't know if the secret word has two R's. But that's acceptable.

But we are testing R at position 4 which we know is correct, and also we are testing M at position 1, Y at position 2, and H at position 5.

But we are also testing the second R at position 3. If the secret word has only one R, then the second R might be marked as absent? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicate R.

How about ""MURKY"": M, U, R, K, Y -> R is at position 3? Not 4.

""BURLY"": B, U, R, L, Y -> R at position 3? Not 4.

We need R at position 4.

Another try: ""HURRY"": H, U, R, R, Y -> R at position 3 and 4? Actually, position 3 is R, position 4 is R? The word is H-U-R-R-Y, so position 4 is R. But we have two R's. And we are testing H, U, Y.

But we have to avoid E, which we are.

But is ""HURRY"" a valid word? Yes.

However, we are testing the same letter twice. We might get less information.

Another word: ""FUROR"": F, U, R, O, R -> but O is eliminated (from guess2: O is not in the word). So invalid.

""LIRIP"": not a word.

""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> no R at position 4.

We need R at position 4.

Let me think: words ending with R? But that would be position 4? Actually, position 4 is the fourth letter. So we need a word with the fourth letter R.

Pattern: _ _ _ R _

So the word has the form: letter1, letter2, letter3, R, letter5.

Now, letter1, letter2, letter3, and letter5 must be from the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And the word must be valid.

Some possibilities:

- ""MIRTH"": but H is at position 5? And we have I at position 3. But the word is M-I-R-T-H? No, that's M-I-R-T-H? But we need R at position 4. Actually, ""MIRTH"" is M-I-R-T-H -> positions: M(1), I(2), R(3), T(4), H(5). So R is at position 3, not 4. So that doesn't work.

We need R at position 4.

How about:

- ""BIRTH"": B, I, R, T, H -> again, R at position 3.

- ""DIRGE"": D, I, R, G, E -> E eliminated.

- ""FIRIE"": not a word.

- ""GIRLY"": G, I, R, L, Y -> R at position 3.

- ""HORNY"": H, O, R, N, Y -> O and N eliminated.

- ""LIRIP"": not a word.

- ""MIRZA"": M, I, R, Z, A -> A eliminated.

- ""MIRTH"" is not correct because R is at 3.

Another idea: ""QUICK"" is invalid because of C.

""QUIRK"" is not a word.

""BRINK"": B, R, I, N, K -> N eliminated.

""BRISK"": B, R, I, S, K -> S eliminated.

""CRIMP"": C eliminated.

""DRUID"": D, R, U, I, D -> R at position 2? Not 4.

We need to focus on words with R at position 4.

How about ""CURRY"": C eliminated.

""BURGH"": B, U, R, G, H -> R at position 3? Not 4.

""WORDY"": W, O, R, D, Y -> O eliminated.

""FORUM"": F, O, R, U, M -> O eliminated.

""LYRUM"": L, Y, R, U, M -> R at position 3? Not 4.

Position 4 is the fourth letter. So we need words where the fourth letter is R.

Examples:

- ""BURQA"": not a common word, and A eliminated.

- ""DIRRA"": not a word.

- ""FURCA"": not a word.

- ""HURRA"": not a word.

- ""MURA"": not 5 letters.

- ""PUREA"": not a word.

- ""TURMA"": not a word.

- ""WORRY"": W, O, R, R, Y -> O eliminated.

- ""CURRY"": C eliminated.

- ""SURFY"": not a word.

- ""HURRY"": H, U, R, R, Y -> this is a word. And it uses H, U, Y and has R at position 4? Let's see: 
  Position 1: H
  Position 2: U
  Position 3: R
  Position 4: R? No, position 4 is the fourth letter. In ""HURRY"", the letters are:
  H (1), U (2), R (3), R (4), Y (5)

So yes, R is at position 4. And the letters are H, U, R, R, Y. We have R at position 3 and 4. But we know R is at position 4, so the R at position 3 might be redundant? But we are testing R at position 4, and also we are testing H, U, Y.

But we are testing the same letter twice. If the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 3 might be marked as absent? But we know R is at position 4, so the R at position 3 might be considered as not present? Actually, the feedback marks each letter independently. But if the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 3 would be marked as absent (x) and the R at position 4 is correct.

But we are testing U and H as well.

However, we are testing the same letter twice, which might not be efficient.

But we have to use the available letters.

Another word: ""MURKY"" -> M, U, R, K, Y -> R is at position 3? Not 4.

""URBAN"": U, R, B, A, N -> A and N eliminated.

""URBEX"": not a word.

""UMBRA"": U, M, B, R, A -> A eliminated.

""UMBRA"" is invalid.

""DUVET"": D, U, V, E, T -> E and T eliminated.

""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> P and S eliminated.

""QUADS"": Q, U, A, D, S -> A and S eliminated.

This is difficult.

Another possibility: ""LURID"": L, U, R, I, D -> R at position 3? Not 4.

""RUDDY"": R, U, D, D, Y -> R at position 1? Not 4.

We need to focus on words that have R at position 4.

How about ""AURUM"" -> A eliminated.

""CURUM"" -> C eliminated.

""DUVET"" -> eliminated letters.

Perhaps ""MURKY"" is not working.

Another idea: ""HURRY"" is one valid word. And it uses H, U, Y. But we are testing two R's.

But we have to consider that the secret word might have two R's? We don't know.

Alternatively, we can try ""GIRTH"": G, I, R, T, H -> T eliminated.

""birth"" is B-I-R-T-H -> R at position 3.

""RHYME"": R at position 1, but E and H? E is eliminated.

""WHIRL"": W, H, I, R, L -> R at position 4? 
  Position 1: W
  Position 2: H
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: R
  Position 5: L

Yes! So ""WHIRL"" is a word (meaning: to make whirled or moved in a spiral). And it uses W, H, I, L.

And the letters are W, H, I, L, and R at position 4.

We haven't tried W, H, I, L. And we avoid the eliminated letters.

So this is a good candidate.

Another word: ""SHIRK"": S eliminated.

""THIRL"": not a word.

""WHIRL"" is valid.

Another one: ""CHIRP"": C eliminated.

""MYRRH"": as before, but R at position 4? M(1), Y(2), R(3), R(4), H(5) -> yes, R at 4.

But ""MYRRH"" is not a common word. ""HURRY"" is more common.

But ""HURRY"" has two R's. We can try ""WHIRL"" which has only one R and four new letters.

""WHIRL"": 
  W at 1, H at 2, I at 3, L at 5.

If the secret word has R at position 4, then we get a check for R at position 4. And we test W, H, I, L.

If the secret word does not have R at position 4, then we get a dash for R at position 4? But we know R is in the word, and we have R at position 4. If the secret word has R at position 4, then we get a check. If not, then we get a dash and we know R must be at position 1,3, or 5? But we have position 3 as I and position 5 as L. So if R is not at 4, then we get a dash for R at position 4, and then we know R must be at 1,3, or 5. And we test W, H, I, L.

So ""WHIRL"" seems good.

Another candidate: ""MIRTH"" is not because R is at 3.

""GRIMY"": G, R, I, M, Y -> R at position 2? Not 4.

""DRUID"": R at 2.

""CRIMP"": C eliminated.

""WRING"": N eliminated.

""BRING"": N eliminated.

""FRISK"": F, R, I, S, K -> S eliminated.

""CRISP"": C and S eliminated.

""TRIPY"": T eliminated.

""VIPER"": V, I, P, E, R -> P and E eliminated.

""UDDER"": U, D, D, E, R -> E eliminated.

""DAILY"": A eliminated.

""GUILT"": G, U, I, L, T -> T eliminated.

""QUILT"": same.

""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> no R at position 4.

We need R at position 4.

Another word: ""CURVY"": C eliminated.

""LURCH"": L, U, R, C, H -> C eliminated.

""LYRCH"": not a word.

""MYRRH"": as before.

""YARNS"": Y, A, R, N, S -> A, N, S eliminated.

""YARKS"": same.

""YAWED"": Y, A, W, E, D -> A and E eliminated.

""YUCKS"": Y, U, C, K, S -> C and S eliminated.

""ZEBRA"": Z, E, B, R, A -> E and A eliminated.

""JUMPS"": P and S eliminated.

""QUADS"": A and S eliminated.

""QUAQU"": not 5 letters.

""QUICK"": C eliminated.

""QUIRK"": not a word.

""QUART"": A eliminated.

""QUART"" is 5 letters? Q-U-A-R-T, but A and T eliminated.

""QUASH"": S and A eliminated.

""QUASI"": not a word.

""QUAY"": not 5 letters.

""QUICK"" is out.

""QUILT"": Q, U, I, L, T -> T eliminated.

""QUINT"": Q, U, I, N, T -> N and T eliminated.

""QUIST"": not a word.

""QUIRL"": not a word.

""QUIRP"": not a word.

""QUICK"" is not.

Another idea: ""WHIRL"" is valid. Or ""WHIRL"" is valid.

""WHIRL"": W, H, I, R, L -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:I, 4:R, 5:L.

We can use this.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have R at position 4, and we are testing W, H, I, L.

If we get feedback that R is correct at position 4, then we know. If not, then R must be at 1,3, or 5.

Also, we test W, H, I, L.

Alternatively, we can try ""MURKY"": M, U, R, K, Y -> R at position 3? Not 4.

""MYRRH"": M, Y, R, R, H -> R at position 3 and 4. So if we put R at position 4, we might get a check for that one and a dash for the other? But we are testing two R's.

But ""MYRRH"" is not a common word. ""HURRY"" is more common.

But ""HURRY"" has two R's. We can try ""WHIRL"" which has only one R and four new letters.

Another word: ""DUVET"" -> eliminated.

""BEIGY"": not a word.

""DEARY"": D, E, A, R, Y -> E and A eliminated.

""HEART"": H, E, A, R, T -> E, A, T eliminated.

""HERON"": H, E, R, O, N -> E, O, N eliminated.

""HEROY"": not a word.

""MERIT"": M, E, R, I, T -> E and T eliminated.

""MERIT"" is out.

""MYTHS"": M, Y, T, H, S -> T and S eliminated.

""MYRRH"": M, Y, R, R, H -> this is a word. But we are testing M, Y, H and the two R's.

But we are testing R at position 3 and 4. We know position 4 is R, so if position 3 is R and it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know position 3 is not R, and we have information about M, Y, H.

But we are testing two R's, which might not be efficient.

Alternatively, ""WHIRL"" tests four new letters and one R (at position 4).

I think ""WHIRL"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: 
  Position 1: W
  Position 2: H
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: R (which we know is correct, so we expect a check for R at 4)
  Position 5: L

We are testing W, H, I, L and also confirming R at 4.

If the secret word has R at position 4, then we get a check for R. If not, we get a dash and then we know R must be at 1,3, or 5. And we get feedback on W, H, I, L.

Moreover, ""WHIRL"" is a valid English word.

So I will go with ""WHIRL"".

But note: we have to make sure that the word is in the dictionary. I believe ""whirl"" is a valid word.

Therefore, the next guess is ""WHIRL"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R is in the word but not in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""sport"")**: R is correct at position 4. S, P, O, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has **R in position 4** (pattern: `_ _ _ R _`).
- Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T** (cannot appear in the word).
- Remaining letters to test: **B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.
- Goal: Test new common letters while respecting the known R at position 4.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Choose a word that fits `_ _ _ R _` and uses only the remaining letters.
- Prioritize high-frequency letters from the remaining set (e.g., L, I, D, U, M, H) to maximize information.
- Avoid eliminated letters and duplicate letters (since we have no evidence of duplicates yet).

After evaluating possible words, **""WHIRL""** is selected because:
- It fits the pattern: `W H I R L` → R is at position 4.
- It tests four new common letters: **W, H, I, L** (all high-frequency and not yet tested).
- It avoids eliminated letters and has no duplicates.
- ""WHIRL"" is a valid English word (meaning: to move in a spiral or whirling).

This guess will:
- Confirm R at position 4 (we already know it's correct, so feedback will show ✓ for R).
- Provide new information about W, H, I, L: 
  - If any are correct (✓), misplaced (-), or absent (x), we narrow down possibilities significantly.

Also, Y is at the end.\n\n However, we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let me try ""ROUST"": \n   R at position 1 (which is a new position for R, so we can check if R is at position 1)\n   O, U, S, T are new letters.\n\n But note: we know R is in the word, so if we put R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If it\'s not, then we know R must be in one of the other positions (3,4,5) and also we get information about O, U, S, T.\n\n However, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a position we haven\'t tried (like position 3,4,5) and also includes other common letters.\n\n Another idea: ""TRIOS"" - but that has T, R, I, O, S. But note: we have to avoid A, E, C, N. This word doesn\'t have those.\n\n However, we already know R is in the word, so we don\'t need to test R again? Actually, we do need to test R because we want to find its position. And we can test it in a new position.\n\n But note: in the first guess, R was at position 2. So we can try position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Let me try to choose a word that has R in a position that is not 2, and also includes other common letters.\n\n Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\n I think ""ROUST"" is a good candidate: \n   R at 1 (new position), O, U, S, T are all new.\n\n But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""ROUST"" is a valid English word.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RUSTS"" but that has duplicate S? And we don\'t know about S.\n\n Another option: ""ROILS"" (meaning: to agitate) -> R at 1, and then O, I, L, S.\n\n But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So we are safe.\n\n However, we might also consider that the word might have the letter R and we can test it in position 1.\n\n But let me check: if we put R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If it\'s not, then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5. And we also test O, U, S, T.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in position 3,4, or 5 and also includes other common letters.\n\n For example: \n   ""PARTY"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So we cannot use A.\n\n We must avoid A, E, C, N.\n\n So let me try ""DIRTY"": \n   D, I, R, T, Y. \n   R is at position 3. \n   This word avoids the forbidden letters.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if D, I, T, Y are in the word. And we are testing R at position 3.\n\n However, we also want to test more common letters. Let\'s compare:\n\n Option 1: ""ROUST"" -> tests R at 1, and letters O, U, S, T.\n Option 2: ""DIRTY"" -> tests R at 3, and letters D, I, T, Y.\n\n Both are valid. But ""ROUST"" uses more common letters? S and T are very common.\n\n However, we have to consider that the word might have S or T? We don\'t know.\n\n But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So the remaining common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.\n\n I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice because it tests R in a new position (1) and also tests S, T, O, U.\n\n But wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 1, we might get:\n   If R is at position 1: then we get a check for R.\n   If not, then we get a dash for R (meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 1) and then we know R must be at 3,4, or 5.\n\n Also, we test O, U, S, T.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROTLS"" but that\'s not a word. How about ""ROILS""? \n   ""ROILS"" is a word (meaning: to agitate). It has R at 1, and then O, I, L, S.\n\n But note: we are testing the same letters as ""ROUST"" but in different order? Actually, ""ROILS"" has R at 1, O at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.\n\n However, we know that the secret word does not have A, E, C, N. So we can use ""ROILS"".\n\n But let me check: we have not tried O, I, L, S. And we are testing R at position 1.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a position that we haven\'t tried and also tests more common letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""SPORT"" -> S, P, O, R, T. But note: R is at position 4. This tests S, P, O, R, T. And we avoid the forbidden letters.\n\n However, we already know R is in the word, so we are testing S, P, O, T.\n\n But we are testing R at position 4. Also, we are testing S at position 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 5.\n\n This seems good.\n\n However, we must note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n Option 1: ""ROUST"" -> tests R at 1, and letters O, U, S, T.\n Option 2: ""SPORT"" -> tests R at 4, and letters S, P, O, T.\n\n Both are good. But ""SPORT"" tests more common letters? S, T, O are common.\n\n But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So the remaining common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.\n\n I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it tests S, P, O, T and R at a new position (4). Also, it uses R at position 4 (which is one of the possibilities) and we get feedback on the other positions.\n\n However, we must be cautious: if the word has R at position 1, then in ""SPORT"" the R at position 4 would be marked as absent? Actually, no: the feedback marks each letter independently. But note: if the word has two R\'s, then if we put R in a position that is not present, it would be marked as dash if there is another R? Actually, the feedback is per letter occurrence. But we don\'t know if there are two R\'s.\n\n To avoid confusion, we might prefer a word without duplicate letters.\n\n So let me avoid duplicates.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""SPORT"" because it tests four new common letters (S, P, O, T) and R at position 4.\n\n But wait: we have to consider that the word might have R at position 1. So if we put R at position 4 and it is not correct, then we still don\'t know about position 1? Actually, we will know: if R is not at position 4, then we get a dash for R and we know R must be at 1,3, or 5. But we have tested position 4 and it was wrong, so then we can try position 1 in the next guess.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and also tests other common letters.\n\n How about ""RUSTS""? That has duplicate S. We don\'t want that.\n\n How about ""ROAST""? But A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So we cannot use A.\n\n How about ""ROBOT""? But B and T are new, but we have two O\'s? And we don\'t know about O. Also, we have to avoid A, E, C, N. This word doesn\'t have those, but it has two O\'s and two O\'s? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, O at 4, T at 5. But we are testing O twice? And we don\'t know if O is in the word.\n\n But we are testing R at position 1 and O at position 2? Also, we are testing B and T.\n\n However, we already know that the secret word does not have A, E, C, N. So we can use ""ROBOT"". But we are testing O twice? That might not be efficient.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROWDY"": R at 1, O at 2, W at 3, D at 4, Y at 5. This tests R at 1 and O at 2. But we don\'t test S or T.\n\n Since S and T are very common, I think including them is better.\n\n How about ""ROUST"" again? It tests R at 1, and also O, U, S, T.\n\n I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice.\n\n But note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter R and we are testing it at position 1. If it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5.\n\n Also, we test O, U, S, T.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""SPORT"" to test R at position 4 and also test S, P, O, T.\n\n I think both are reasonable. Let me pick ""SPORT"" because it tests S, P, O, T and R at a new position.\n\n But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, N, E. ""SPORT"" does not contain any of these.\n\n So I will go with ""SPORT"".\n\n However, note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter R and we are testing it at position 4. If the R is at position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know R is at 1,3, or 5.\n\n Also, we get feedback on S, P, O, T.\n\n Let me write the guess: ""SPORT""\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 4, we might get:\n\n   If R is at position 4: then we get a check for R.\n   If R is not at position 4, then we get a dash for R (meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 4) and then we know R must be at 1,3, or 5.\n\n Also, we test S at position 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 5.\n\n We might get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and also tests other common letters. For example, ""ROBOT"" is not ideal because of duplicate O.\n\n Another candidate: ""RUSTY"" -> R at 1, U at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. This tests R at 1 and U, S, T, Y.\n\n But Y is less common.\n\n How about ""RISKY""? But that has S and K, but also I and Y. And R at 1.\n\n But we don\'t know if I is in the word.\n\n After considering, I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice.\n\n Let me check if ""SPORT"" is a valid word: yes.\n\n So I will guess ""SPORT"".\n\n But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any of the absent letters. We are not.\n\n Therefore, the next guess is ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- R is in the secret word but not in position 2.\n- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.\n\nFor the next guess, I need to:\n1. Include R (since it\'s confirmed in the word) but avoid position 2.\n2. Exclude C, A, N, E.\n3. Test new common letters to gather more information.\n\nI chose ""SPORT"" because:\n- R is placed in position 4 (a new position to test).\n- It introduces four new common letters: S, P, O, T.\n- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, A, N, E) and duplicates.\n- If R is in position 4, it will be marked correct; if not, the feedback will confirm R must be in position 1, 3, or 5, while providing info on S, P, O, T.\n\n<guess>sport</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) R(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in the word)\n  R: - (in the word but wrong position; specifically, not at position 2)\n  A: x (not in the word)\n  N: x (not in the word)\n  E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""sport""\n  S: x (not in the word)\n  P: x (not in the word)\n  O: x (not in the word)\n  R: ✓ (correct, meaning R is in the word and in position 4)\n  T: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n\n1. The secret word has the letter R in the 4th position (since R was marked correct in ""sport"").\n2. The secret word contains the letter R, and we now know it is at position 4.\n3. The letters C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T are not in the secret word.\n\nSo the secret word has the form: _ _ _ R _\n\nWe have eliminated the letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T.\n\nThe remaining letters to consider are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe also know that the word must have 5 letters, with R at position 4.\n\nWe need to choose a word that:\n- Has R at position 4.\n- Uses only letters from the remaining set (avoiding C,A,N,E,S,P,O,T).\n- Tests new common letters to maximize information.\n\nCommon letters from the remaining set: L, I, D, U, M, H, G, B, etc.\n\nWe should try to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\nPossible words that fit the pattern _ _ _ R _ and use only the remaining letters:\n\nLet\'s think of words:\n\n- ""DIRTY"": but D, I, R, T, Y -> but T is eliminated (from guess2: T is not in the word). So invalid.\n\n- ""BIRTH"": B, I, R, T, H -> T is eliminated. Invalid.\n\n- ""MIRTH"": same issue.\n\n- ""GIRTH"": same issue.\n\n- ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> but A is eliminated. Invalid.\n\n- ""HAIRY"": H, A, I, R, Y -> A eliminated.\n\n- ""FAIRY"": F, A, I, R, Y -> A eliminated.\n\n- ""BUILT"": B, U, I, L, T -> T eliminated.\n\n- ""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> but we have R at position 4? The word is G-U-I-L-D, so R is missing. We need R at position 4.\n\nWe must have R at position 4.\n\nSo the pattern is: _ _ _ R _\n\nLet me try to find words that fit this pattern and use only the remaining letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""QUICK"": but Q and K are still available? But note: we have eliminated C and K? Actually, we haven\'t eliminated K. But wait, ""QUICK"" has C which is eliminated. So invalid.\n\n- ""QUIRK"": but that\'s not a word.\n\n- ""BRICK"": B, R, I, C, K -> but C is eliminated.\n\n- ""PRICK"": P is eliminated.\n\n- ""WRING"": W, R, I, N, G -> but N is eliminated.\n\n- ""GRIMY"": G, R, I, M, Y -> but we have R at position 2? The pattern is _ _ _ R _, so position 2 must be a letter. In ""GRIMY"", R is at position 2, not 4. So that doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe need R at position 4.\n\nAnother idea: ""FERRY"" -> but E is eliminated and also R is at position 2 and 3? Not at 4.\n\n""BERRY"": B, E, R, R, Y -> E eliminated and R at position 3? Not 4.\n\n""DIRGE"": D, I, R, G, E -> E eliminated.\n\n""VIRUS"": V, I, R, U, S -> S eliminated.\n\n""LYRIC"": L, Y, R, I, C -> C eliminated.\n\n""MYRRH"": M, Y, R, R, H -> R at position 3 and 4? Actually, position 4 is R. But we have two R\'s? And we don\'t know if there are two R\'s. But the word is M-Y-R-R-H. So positions: M(1), Y(2), R(3), R(4), H(5). But we have R at position 4, which is good. But we are testing M, Y, H and also the second R? But we don\'t know if there is a second R.\n\nHowever, we are limited by the available letters. We must avoid the eliminated letters.\n\nBut note: we have not eliminated M, Y, H. So ""MYRRH"" is a valid word? Yes, but it has two R\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has two R\'s. But that\'s acceptable.\n\nBut we are testing R at position 4 which we know is correct, and also we are testing M at position 1, Y at position 2, and H at position 5.\n\nBut we are also testing the second R at position 3. If the secret word has only one R, then the second R might be marked as absent? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word without duplicate R.\n\nHow about ""MURKY"": M, U, R, K, Y -> R is at position 3? Not 4.\n\n""BURLY"": B, U, R, L, Y -> R at position 3? Not 4.\n\nWe need R at position 4.\n\nAnother try: ""HURRY"": H, U, R, R, Y -> R at position 3 and 4? Actually, position 3 is R, position 4 is R? The word is H-U-R-R-Y, so position 4 is R. But we have two R\'s. And we are testing H, U, Y.\n\nBut we have to avoid E, which we are.\n\nBut is ""HURRY"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nHowever, we are testing the same letter twice. We might get less information.\n\nAnother word: ""FUROR"": F, U, R, O, R -> but O is eliminated (from guess2: O is not in the word). So invalid.\n\n""LIRIP"": not a word.\n\n""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> no R at position 4.\n\nWe need R at position 4.\n\nLet me think: words ending with R? But that would be position 4? Actually, position 4 is the fourth letter. So we need a word with the fourth letter R.\n\nPattern: _ _ _ R _\n\nSo the word has the form: letter1, letter2, letter3, R, letter5.\n\nNow, letter1, letter2, letter3, and letter5 must be from the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nAnd the word must be valid.\n\nSome possibilities:\n\n- ""MIRTH"": but H is at position 5? And we have I at position 3. But the word is M-I-R-T-H? No, that\'s M-I-R-T-H? But we need R at position 4. Actually, ""MIRTH"" is M-I-R-T-H -> positions: M(1), I(2), R(3), T(4), H(5). So R is at position 3, not 4. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe need R at position 4.\n\nHow about:\n\n- ""BIRTH"": B, I, R, T, H -> again, R at position 3.\n\n- ""DIRGE"": D, I, R, G, E -> E eliminated.\n\n- ""FIRIE"": not a word.\n\n- ""GIRLY"": G, I, R, L, Y -> R at position 3.\n\n- ""HORNY"": H, O, R, N, Y -> O and N eliminated.\n\n- ""LIRIP"": not a word.\n\n- ""MIRZA"": M, I, R, Z, A -> A eliminated.\n\n- ""MIRTH"" is not correct because R is at 3.\n\nAnother idea: ""QUICK"" is invalid because of C.\n\n""QUIRK"" is not a word.\n\n""BRINK"": B, R, I, N, K -> N eliminated.\n\n""BRISK"": B, R, I, S, K -> S eliminated.\n\n""CRIMP"": C eliminated.\n\n""DRUID"": D, R, U, I, D -> R at position 2?

Not 4.\n\n""WORDY"": W, O, R, D, Y -> O eliminated.\n\n""FORUM"": F, O, R, U, M -> O eliminated.\n\n""LYRUM"": L, Y, R, U, M -> R at position 3? Not 4.\n\nPosition 4 is the fourth letter. So we need words where the fourth letter is R.\n\nExamples:\n\n- ""BURQA"": not a common word, and A eliminated.\n\n- ""DIRRA"": not a word.\n\n- ""FURCA"": not a word.\n\n- ""HURRA"": not a word.\n\n- ""MURA"": not 5 letters.\n\n- ""PUREA"": not a word.\n\n- ""TURMA"": not a word.\n\n- ""WORRY"": W, O, R, R, Y -> O eliminated.\n\n- ""CURRY"": C eliminated.\n\n- ""SURFY"": not a word.\n\n- ""HURRY"": H, U, R, R, Y -> this is a word. And it uses H, U, Y and has R at position 4? Let\'s see: \n  Position 1: H\n  Position 2: U\n  Position 3: R\n  Position 4: R? No, position 4 is the fourth letter. In ""HURRY"", the letters are:\n  H (1), U (2), R (3), R (4), Y (5)\n\nSo yes, R is at position 4. And the letters are H, U, R, R, Y. We have R at position 3 and 4. But we know R is at position 4, so the R at position 3 might be redundant? But we are testing R at position 4, and also we are testing H, U, Y.\n\nBut we are testing the same letter twice. If the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 3 might be marked as absent? But we know R is at position 4, so the R at position 3 might be considered as not present? Actually, the feedback marks each letter independently. But if the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 3 would be marked as absent (x) and the R at position 4 is correct.\n\nBut we are testing U and H as well.\n\nHowever, we are testing the same letter twice, which might not be efficient.\n\nBut we have to use the available letters.\n\nAnother word: ""MURKY"" -> M, U, R, K, Y -> R is at position 3? Not 4.\n\n""URBAN"": U, R, B, A, N -> A and N eliminated.\n\n""URBEX"": not a word.\n\n""UMBRA"": U, M, B, R, A -> A eliminated.\n\n""UMBRA"" is invalid.\n\n""DUVET"": D, U, V, E, T -> E and T eliminated.\n\n""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> P and S eliminated.\n\n""QUADS"": Q, U, A, D, S -> A and S eliminated.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nAnother possibility: ""LURID"": L, U, R, I, D -> R at position 3? Not 4.\n\n""RUDDY"": R, U, D, D, Y -> R at position 1? Not 4.\n\nWe need to focus on words that have R at position 4.\n\nHow about ""AURUM"" -> A eliminated.\n\n""CURUM"" -> C eliminated.\n\n""DUVET"" -> eliminated letters.\n\nPerhaps ""MURKY"" is not working.\n\nAnother idea: ""HURRY"" is one valid word. And it uses H, U, Y. But we are testing two R\'s.\n\nBut we have to consider that the secret word might have two R\'s? We don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""GIRTH"": G, I, R, T, H -> T eliminated.\n\n""birth"" is B-I-R-T-H -> R at position 3.\n\n""RHYME"": R at position 1, but E and H? E is eliminated.\n\n""WHIRL"": W, H, I, R, L -> R at position 4? \n  Position 1: W\n  Position 2: H\n  Position 3: I\n  Position 4: R\n  Position 5: L\n\nYes! So ""WHIRL"" is a word (meaning: to make whirled or moved in a spiral). And it uses W, H, I, L.\n\nAnd the letters are W, H, I, L, and R at position 4.\n\nWe haven\'t tried W, H, I, L. And we avoid the eliminated letters.\n\nSo this is a good candidate.\n\nAnother word: ""SHIRK"": S eliminated.\n\n""THIRL"": not a word.\n\n""WHIRL"" is valid.\n\nAnother one: ""CHIRP"": C eliminated.\n\n""MYRRH"": as before, but R at position 4? M(1), Y(2), R(3), R(4), H(5) -> yes, R at 4.\n\nBut ""MYRRH"" is not a common word. ""HURRY"" is more common.\n\nBut ""HURRY"" has two R\'s. We can try ""WHIRL"" which has only one R and four new letters.\n\n""WHIRL"": \n  W at 1, H at 2, I at 3, L at 5.\n\nIf the secret word has R at position 4, then we get a check for R at position 4. And we test W, H, I, L.\n\nIf the secret word does not have R at position 4, then we get a dash for R at position 4? But we know R is in the word, and we have R at position 4. If the secret word has R at position 4, then we get a check. If not, then we get a dash and we know R must be at position 1,3, or 5? But we have position 3 as I and position 5 as L. So if R is not at 4, then we get a dash for R at position 4, and then we know R must be at 1,3, or 5. And we test W, H, I, L.\n\nSo ""WHIRL"" seems good.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MIRTH"" is not because R is at 3.\n\n""GRIMY"": G, R, I, M, Y -> R at position 2?

And we get feedback on W, H, I, L.\n\nMoreover, ""WHIRL"" is a valid English word.\n\nSo I will go with ""WHIRL"".\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that the word is in the dictionary. I believe ""whirl"" is a valid word.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""WHIRL"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R is in the word but not in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (""sport"")**: R is correct at position 4. S, P, O, T are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word has **R in position 4** (pattern: `_ _ _ R _`).\n- Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T** (cannot appear in the word).\n- Remaining letters to test: **B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.\n- Goal: Test new common letters while respecting the known R at position 4.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Choose a word that fits `_ _ _ R _` and uses only the remaining letters.\n- Prioritize high-frequency letters from the remaining set (e.g., L, I, D, U, M, H) to maximize information.\n- Avoid eliminated letters and duplicate letters (since we have no evidence of duplicates yet).\n\nAfter evaluating possible words, **""WHIRL""** is selected because:\n- It fits the pattern: `W H I R L` → R is at position 4.\n- It tests four new common letters: **W, H, I, L** (all high-frequency and not yet tested).\n- It avoids eliminated letters and has no duplicates.\n- ""WHIRL"" is a valid English word (meaning: to move in a spiral or whirling).\n\nThis guess will:\n- Confirm R at position 4 (we already know it\'s correct, so feedback will show ✓ for R).\n- Provide new information about W, H, I, L: \n  - If any are correct (✓), misplaced (-), or absent (x), we narrow down possibilities significantly.\n\n<guess>whirl</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) R(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: whirl -> FEEDBACK: W(x) H(x) I(-) R(✓) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Incorrect format think\n\n<guess>Incorrect format answer</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) R(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: whirl -> FEEDBACK: W(x) H(x) I(-) R(✓) L(x)\nModel answer is not in the correct format\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for Guess 3: ""whirl"" -> W(x) H(x) I(-) R(✓) L(x)
 This means:
  - W is not in the word (x)
  - H is not in the word (x)
  - I is in the word but not in position 3 (since in ""whirl"", I is at position 3, and it's marked as - meaning wrong position) 
  - R is correct at position 4 (✓)
  - L is not in the word (x)

So, from all feedback so far:

Correct positions:
  - Position 4: R

Wrong position but present:
  - I (but not at position 3)

Absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T, W, H, L

Therefore, the secret word has:
  - The letter I is present, but not at position 3.
  - The letter R at position 4.
  - And we know the word does not contain: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T, W, H, L.

We have eliminated: A, C, E, H, L, N, O, P, S, T, W.

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

But note: we know I is in the word, but not at position 3. And we have R at position 4.

So the word pattern is: _ _ _ R _

And the word contains I (but not at position 3) and does not contain the eliminated letters.

We need to choose a word that:
  - Has R at position 4.
  - Contains the letter I (but not at position 3).
  - Uses only letters from the remaining set: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But note: I is already known to be in the word, so we must include I. But we cannot put I at position 3 because the feedback said I is not at position 3 (in ""whirl"", I was at position 3 and was wrong position, so I cannot be at position 3 in the secret word).

In fact, the feedback says I is in the word but not at position 3. So in our next guess, we can put I in a different position (1,2,4,5) but note:
  - Position 4 is R, so I cannot be at position 4? Actually, position 4 is R, so I cannot be at position 4. And position 3 is not allowed for I.

So I must be at position 1, 2, or 5.

Now, we have to form a word with the pattern _ _ _ R _ and include I at one of the positions: 1,2, or 5.

Also, we are testing new letters to find the other letters.

We have to avoid the eliminated letters: A,C,E,H,L,N,O,P,S,T,W.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z

But note: I is already in the word, so we are only missing two more letters? Actually, the word has 5 letters: we have R at 4 and I somewhere else, and two more letters.

We need to choose two more letters from the available set.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, M, U, Y (vowels) and K, V, X (consonants).

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Possible positions for I:
  - Position 1: then the word starts with I, then we have _ _ R _ . 
  - Position 2: then _ I _ R _ 
  - Position 5: then _ _ _ R I

Now, we need to fill the blanks with letters from the available set.

Let's try to find words that fit.

Option 1: I at position 1 -> ""I _ _ R _""

Words: 
  ""IMPUR"" not a word.
  ""INFER"" -> but N and E eliminated.
  ""IDLER"" -> E eliminated.
  ""IGLOO"" -> O and L eliminated.

Not many options. 

Option 2: I at position 2 -> ""_ I _ R _""

Words:
  ""BIKER"" -> E? Eliminated? E is eliminated, but ""BIKER"" has E? B-I-K-E-R -> E is at position 4? But we have R at position 4. So the word is B-I-K-E-R -> but E is eliminated, so invalid.

  ""DIVER"" -> E eliminated.

  ""FILMR"" not a word.

  ""GIVER"" -> E eliminated.

  ""MIXER"" -> E eliminated.

  ""SIVER"" -> S eliminated.

  ""TIGER"" -> T and E eliminated.

  ""VIGIL"" -> V, I, G, I, L -> but L is eliminated, and also duplicate I? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But L is eliminated.

  ""VIRUS"" -> S and U? S eliminated.

  ""DIVOT"" -> O and T eliminated.

  ""KIOSK"" -> O and S eliminated.

  ""QUIRK"" -> not a word.

  ""QUICK"" -> C eliminated.

  ""QUILT"" -> T eliminated.

  ""QUINT"" -> N and T eliminated.

  ""QUIST"" -> not a word.

  ""QUART"" -> A eliminated.

  ""QUASH"" -> S and A eliminated.

  ""QUASI"" -> not a word.

  ""QUAY"" -> not 5 letters? Q-U-A-Y -> A eliminated.

  ""QUICK"" is out.

  ""QUIET"" -> E and T eliminated.

  ""QUILL"" -> L eliminated.

  ""QUINT"" is out.

  ""QUIRK"" not a word.

  ""QUART"" is out.

  ""QUASH"" is out.

  ""QUASI"" not word.

  ""QUAY"" not 5.

So it seems difficult to find a word with I at position 2 that fits the pattern and avoids the eliminated letters.

Option 3: I at position 5 -> ""_ _ _ R I""

Words:
  ""BARRI"" -> A eliminated.
  ""CARRI"" -> C eliminated.
  ""FERRI"" -> E eliminated.
  ""GERRI"" -> E eliminated.
  ""MERRI"" -> E eliminated.
  ""VIRRI"" -> not a word.

  ""BARNI"" -> A and N eliminated.

  ""BURRI"" -> not a word? Or ""burri"" is not standard.

  ""CURRI"" -> C eliminated.

  ""DERRI"" -> E eliminated.

  ""JERRI"" -> E eliminated.

  ""PERRI"" -> E and P eliminated.

  ""TERRI"" -> E and T eliminated.

  ""ZERRI"" -> E eliminated.

  ""BERRI"" -> E eliminated.

  ""DIRRI"" -> not a word.

  ""FERRI"" -> E eliminated.

  ""GERRI"" -> E eliminated.

  ""MERRI"" -> E eliminated.

  ""VERRI"" -> E and V? ""VERRI"" is not a common word. And E is eliminated.

  ""ZERRI"" -> E eliminated.

So it seems that words with I at position 5 are rare because they often end with I and use vowels that are eliminated.

Therefore, the only feasible position for I is position 1 or 2.

But position 2 seems hard to fill.

Perhaps we should consider that I might be at position 1? But we couldn't find a word.

Another idea: what about ""BURKA""? But A is eliminated.

""DIRGE"" -> E eliminated.

""FIRIE"" -> not a word.

""GIRLY"": G, I, R, L, Y -> but L is eliminated.

""MYRRH"": M, Y, R, R, H -> H eliminated and duplicate R.

""MYTHI"" -> not a word.

""QUIRK"" not a word.

""QUIET"" -> E and T out.

""QUILL"" -> L out.

""QUINT"" -> N and T out.

""QUIST"" -> not a word.

""QUART"" -> A out.

""QUASH"" -> S and A out.

""QUASI"" -> not a word.

""QUAY"" -> not 5 letters? Q-U-A-Y -> A out.

""QUICK"" -> C out.

""QUIET"" -> E and T out.

""QUILL"" -> L out.

""QUINT"" -> N and T out.

""QUIRK"" -> not a word.

""QUIET"" is out.

Perhaps ""URBAN"" -> A and N out.

""URBEX"" -> not a word.

""URBUR"" -> not 5 letters.

""URVY"" -> not a word.

""USURP"" -> S and P out.

""USURY"" -> not 5.

""USQUE"" -> not a word.

""USURE"" -> E out.

""USURP"" -> S and P out.

""USURY"" -> not 5.

""USQUE"" -> not a word.

""USURP"" -> S and P out.

""USURP"" is not.

""USQUE"" -> not.

So it seems that the only possibility is to put I at position 1.

So let's try I at position 1.

Pattern: I _ _ R _

We need to fill positions 2,3,5 with letters from: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (and I is already used at position 1, but it can be used again? We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but the feedback hasn't shown duplicates so far. However, we cannot rule out duplicates. But to be safe, we should avoid duplicates unless necessary.

But we don't have evidence of duplicates, so we might avoid them.

But we have to use the available letters.

Possible words:

- ""IMMIX"" -> not a word.

- ""IMBUE"" -> E eliminated.

- ""IMD  "" -> not 5.

- ""IMAGE"" -> A and E eliminated.

- ""IDLER"" -> E eliminated.

- ""IGLOO"" -> O and L eliminated.

- ""INKER"" -> N and E eliminated.

- ""ISLET"" -> S and L and E? S and L and E are eliminated.

- ""INPUT"" -> N and P and T eliminated.

- ""INURE"" -> N and E eliminated.

- ""IVORY"" -> O and Y? O is eliminated.

- ""INURE"" is out.

- ""IDIOM"" -> O and M? O is eliminated.

- ""IDIOT"" -> O and T eliminated.

- ""IDIOM"" -> O eliminated.

- ""IDIOT"" -> O and T eliminated.

- ""IMPEL"" -> E and L eliminated.

- ""IMBUE"" -> E eliminated.

- ""IMD  "" -> not 5.

- ""IMAGE"" -> A and E out.

- ""ICILY"" -> I at position 1, then C and L? C and L are eliminated.

- ""IVIED"" -> E and D? E out.

Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", R is at position 2, and it's marked as wrong position).
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and does not contain C, A, N, E.

 We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

 For the next guess, we should choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter R (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position than the second (because in the first guess it was in position 2 and was wrong).
 2. Avoids the letters C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word).
 3. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Since R is in the word, we can try to put R in a different position. Also, we know that the word does not have A, E, and also C and N.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible. We have eliminated A, E, and also C, N. So the remaining vowels are I, O, U (and sometimes Y, but we avoid for now).

 We also know that the word has R, and we have 4 other letters to choose (from the alphabet without C, A, N, E).

 We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

 A good second guess might be ""ROTLS"" but that's not a word. We need a valid 5-letter word.

 Let me think of words that have R and avoid C, A, N, E.

 Possible words: 
   ""ROILS"" (meaning: to agitate) -> but we don't know if O, I, L, S are in the word.
   ""ROUST"" (meaning: to drive out or disturb) -> R at position 1, but we know R is not at position 2? Actually, we don't know about position 1. In the first guess, R was at position 2 and was wrong, but it could be at position 1? However, we don't have information about position 1 yet.

 But note: the feedback for the first guess only tells us that R is in the word but not at position 2. It could be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 However, we also have to avoid the letters C, A, N, E.

 Let me try to come up with a word that has R and uses other common letters.

 Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We should try to include as many of these as possible.

 A good candidate might be ""SPRIT"" but that's not a common word. Another idea: ""TRIES"" - but note that we have 5 letters and we want to avoid the known absent letters.

 However, we must avoid A, E, C, N.

 Let me think of words that have R and use common letters.

 Option 1: ""ROTLS"" is not a word. How about ""ROUST""? That's valid.

 But note: we have the letter U? We don't know about U. And we haven't tried S, T, L.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PRIOR"" but that has two R's? And we don't know if there are two R's. But the feedback for the first guess only showed one R? Actually, the feedback only marks the letters that are present. If there are two R's, then both would be marked? But in the first guess, we only had one R and it was marked as present (but wrong position). So the word has at least one R. It might have two.

 However, we don't have information about duplicates. So we can try a word with duplicate R? But we don't know.

 But to keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Another candidate: ""ROOMy"" - but that has two O's and we don't know about O. Also, Y is at the end.

 However, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let me try ""ROUST"": 
   R at position 1 (which is a new position for R, so we can check if R is at position 1)
   O, U, S, T are new letters.

 But note: we know R is in the word, so if we put R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If it's not, then we know R must be in one of the other positions (3,4,5) and also we get information about O, U, S, T.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a position we haven't tried (like position 3,4,5) and also includes other common letters.

 Another idea: ""TRIOS"" - but that has T, R, I, O, S. But note: we have to avoid A, E, C, N. This word doesn't have those.

 However, we already know R is in the word, so we don't need to test R again? Actually, we do need to test R because we want to find its position. And we can test it in a new position.

 But note: in the first guess, R was at position 2. So we can try position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Let me try to choose a word that has R in a position that is not 2, and also includes other common letters.

 Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

 I think ""ROUST"" is a good candidate: 
   R at 1 (new position), O, U, S, T are all new.

 But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""ROUST"" is a valid English word.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RUSTS"" but that has duplicate S? And we don't know about S.

 Another option: ""ROILS"" (meaning: to agitate) -> R at 1, and then O, I, L, S.

 But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So we are safe.

 However, we might also consider that the word might have the letter R and we can test it in position 1.

 But let me check: if we put R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a check. If it's not, then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5. And we also test O, U, S, T.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in position 3,4, or 5 and also includes other common letters.

 For example: 
   ""PARTY"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A, E, C, N.

 So let me try ""DIRTY"": 
   D, I, R, T, Y. 
   R is at position 3. 
   This word avoids the forbidden letters.

 But note: we don't know if D, I, T, Y are in the word. And we are testing R at position 3.

 However, we also want to test more common letters. Let's compare:

 Option 1: ""ROUST"" -> tests R at 1, and letters O, U, S, T.
 Option 2: ""DIRTY"" -> tests R at 3, and letters D, I, T, Y.

 Both are valid. But ""ROUST"" uses more common letters? S and T are very common.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have S or T? We don't know.

 But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So the remaining common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

 I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice because it tests R in a new position (1) and also tests S, T, O, U.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 1, we might get:
   If R is at position 1: then we get a check for R.
   If not, then we get a dash for R (meaning it's in the word but not at position 1) and then we know R must be at 3,4, or 5.

 Also, we test O, U, S, T.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROTLS"" but that's not a word. How about ""ROILS""? 
   ""ROILS"" is a word (meaning: to agitate). It has R at 1, and then O, I, L, S.

 But note: we are testing the same letters as ""ROUST"" but in different order? Actually, ""ROILS"" has R at 1, O at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.

 However, we know that the secret word does not have A, E, C, N. So we can use ""ROILS"".

 But let me check: we have not tried O, I, L, S. And we are testing R at position 1.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a position that we haven't tried and also tests more common letters.

 Another candidate: ""SPORT"" -> S, P, O, R, T. But note: R is at position 4. This tests S, P, O, R, T. And we avoid the forbidden letters.

 However, we already know R is in the word, so we are testing S, P, O, T.

 But we are testing R at position 4. Also, we are testing S at position 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 5.

 This seems good.

 However, we must note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: ""ROUST"" -> tests R at 1, and letters O, U, S, T.
 Option 2: ""SPORT"" -> tests R at 4, and letters S, P, O, T.

 Both are good. But ""SPORT"" tests more common letters? S, T, O are common.

 But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So the remaining common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

 I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it tests S, P, O, T and R at a new position (4). Also, it uses R at position 4 (which is one of the possibilities) and we get feedback on the other positions.

 However, we must be cautious: if the word has R at position 1, then in ""SPORT"" the R at position 4 would be marked as absent? Actually, no: the feedback marks each letter independently. But note: if the word has two R's, then if we put R in a position that is not present, it would be marked as dash if there is another R? Actually, the feedback is per letter occurrence. But we don't know if there are two R's.

 To avoid confusion, we might prefer a word without duplicate letters.

 So let me avoid duplicates.

 Therefore, I choose ""SPORT"" because it tests four new common letters (S, P, O, T) and R at position 4.

 But wait: we have to consider that the word might have R at position 1. So if we put R at position 4 and it is not correct, then we still don't know about position 1? Actually, we will know: if R is not at position 4, then we get a dash for R and we know R must be at 1,3, or 5. But we have tested position 4 and it was wrong, so then we can try position 1 in the next guess.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and also tests other common letters.

 How about ""RUSTS""? That has duplicate S. We don't want that.

 How about ""ROAST""? But A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So we cannot use A.

 How about ""ROBOT""? But B and T are new, but we have two O's? And we don't know about O. Also, we have to avoid A, E, C, N. This word doesn't have those, but it has two O's and two O's? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, O at 4, T at 5. But we are testing O twice? And we don't know if O is in the word.

 But we are testing R at position 1 and O at position 2? Also, we are testing B and T.

 However, we already know that the secret word does not have A, E, C, N. So we can use ""ROBOT"". But we are testing O twice? That might not be efficient.

 Alternatively, ""ROWDY"": R at 1, O at 2, W at 3, D at 4, Y at 5. This tests R at 1 and O at 2. But we don't test S or T.

 Since S and T are very common, I think including them is better.

 How about ""ROUST"" again? It tests R at 1, and also O, U, S, T.

 I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter R and we are testing it at position 1. If it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5.

 Also, we test O, U, S, T.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPORT"" to test R at position 4 and also test S, P, O, T.

 I think both are reasonable. Let me pick ""SPORT"" because it tests S, P, O, T and R at a new position.

 But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, N, E. ""SPORT"" does not contain any of these.

 So I will go with ""SPORT"".

 However, note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter R and we are testing it at position 4. If the R is at position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know R is at 1,3, or 5.

 Also, we get feedback on S, P, O, T.

 Let me write the guess: ""SPORT""

 But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 4, we might get:

   If R is at position 4: then we get a check for R.
   If R is not at position 4, then we get a dash for R (meaning it's in the word but not at position 4) and then we know R must be at 1,3, or 5.

 Also, we test S at position 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 5.

 We might get more information.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and also tests other common letters. For example, ""ROBOT"" is not ideal because of duplicate O.

 Another candidate: ""RUSTY"" -> R at 1, U at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. This tests R at 1 and U, S, T, Y.

 But Y is less common.

 How about ""RISKY""? But that has S and K, but also I and Y. And R at 1.

 But we don't know if I is in the word.

 After considering, I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice.

 Let me check if ""SPORT"" is a valid word: yes.

 So I will guess ""SPORT"".

 But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any of the absent letters. We are not.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2.
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Include R (since it's confirmed in the word) but avoid position 2.
2. Exclude C, A, N, E.
3. Test new common letters to gather more information.

I chose ""SPORT"" because:
- R is placed in position 4 (a new position to test).
- It introduces four new common letters: S, P, O, T.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, A, N, E) and duplicates.
- If R is in position 4, it will be marked correct; if not, the feedback will confirm R must be in position 1, 3, or 5, while providing info on S, P, O, T.

<guess>sport</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) R(✓) T(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word but wrong position; specifically, not at position 2)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""sport""
  S: x (not in the word)
  P: x (not in the word)
  O: x (not in the word)
  R: ✓ (correct, meaning R is in the word and in position 4)
  T: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:

1. The secret word has the letter R in the 4th position (since R was marked correct in ""sport"").
2. The secret word contains the letter R, and we now know it is at position 4.
3. The letters C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T are not in the secret word.

So the secret word has the form: _ _ _ R _

We have eliminated the letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T.

The remaining letters to consider are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word must have 5 letters, with R at position 4.

We need to choose a word that:
- Has R at position 4.
- Uses only letters from the remaining set (avoiding C,A,N,E,S,P,O,T).
- Tests new common letters to maximize information.

Common letters from the remaining set: L, I, D, U, M, H, G, B, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Possible words that fit the pattern _ _ _ R _ and use only the remaining letters:

Let's think of words:

- ""DIRTY"": but D, I, R, T, Y -> but T is eliminated (from guess2: T is not in the word). So invalid.

- ""BIRTH"": B, I, R, T, H -> T is eliminated. Invalid.

- ""MIRTH"": same issue.

- ""GIRTH"": same issue.

- ""DAILY"": D, A, I, L, Y -> but A is eliminated. Invalid.

- ""HAIRY"": H, A, I, R, Y -> A eliminated.

- ""FAIRY"": F, A, I, R, Y -> A eliminated.

- ""BUILT"": B, U, I, L, T -> T eliminated.

- ""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> but we have R at position 4? The word is G-U-I-L-D, so R is missing. We need R at position 4.

We must have R at position 4.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ R _

Let me try to find words that fit this pattern and use only the remaining letters.

Possible words:

- ""QUICK"": but Q and K are still available? But note: we have eliminated C and K? Actually, we haven't eliminated K. But wait, ""QUICK"" has C which is eliminated. So invalid.

- ""QUIRK"": but that's not a word.

- ""BRICK"": B, R, I, C, K -> but C is eliminated.

- ""PRICK"": P is eliminated.

- ""WRING"": W, R, I, N, G -> but N is eliminated.

- ""GRIMY"": G, R, I, M, Y -> but we have R at position 2? The pattern is _ _ _ R _, so position 2 must be a letter. In ""GRIMY"", R is at position 2, not 4. So that doesn't fit.

We need R at position 4.

Another idea: ""FERRY"" -> but E is eliminated and also R is at position 2 and 3? Not at 4.

""BERRY"": B, E, R, R, Y -> E eliminated and R at position 3? Not 4.

""DIRGE"": D, I, R, G, E -> E eliminated.

""VIRUS"": V, I, R, U, S -> S eliminated.

""LYRIC"": L, Y, R, I, C -> C eliminated.

""MYRRH"": M, Y, R, R, H -> R at position 3 and 4? Actually, position 4 is R. But we have two R's? And we don't know if there are two R's. But the word is M-Y-R-R-H. So positions: M(1), Y(2), R(3), R(4), H(5). But we have R at position 4, which is good. But we are testing M, Y, H and also the second R? But we don't know if there is a second R.

However, we are limited by the available letters. We must avoid the eliminated letters.

But note: we have not eliminated M, Y, H. So ""MYRRH"" is a valid word? Yes, but it has two R's. We don't know if the secret word has two R's. But that's acceptable.

But we are testing R at position 4 which we know is correct, and also we are testing M at position 1, Y at position 2, and H at position 5.

But we are also testing the second R at position 3. If the secret word has only one R, then the second R might be marked as absent? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word without duplicate R.

How about ""MURKY"": M, U, R, K, Y -> R is at position 3? Not 4.

""BURLY"": B, U, R, L, Y -> R at position 3? Not 4.

We need R at position 4.

Another try: ""HURRY"": H, U, R, R, Y -> R at position 3 and 4? Actually, position 3 is R, position 4 is R? The word is H-U-R-R-Y, so position 4 is R. But we have two R's. And we are testing H, U, Y.

But we have to avoid E, which we are.

But is ""HURRY"" a valid word? Yes.

However, we are testing the same letter twice. We might get less information.

Another word: ""FUROR"": F, U, R, O, R -> but O is eliminated (from guess2: O is not in the word). So invalid.

""LIRIP"": not a word.

""GUILD"": G, U, I, L, D -> no R at position 4.

We need R at position 4.

Let me think: words ending with R? But that would be position 4? Actually, position 4 is the fourth letter. So we need a word with the fourth letter R.

Pattern: _ _ _ R _

So the word has the form: letter1, letter2, letter3, R, letter5.

Now, letter1, letter2, letter3, and letter5 must be from the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

And the word must be valid.

Some possibilities:

- ""MIRTH"": but H is at position 5? And we have I at position 3. But the word is M-I-R-T-H? No, that's M-I-R-T-H? But we need R at position 4. Actually, ""MIRTH"" is M-I-R-T-H -> positions: M(1), I(2), R(3), T(4), H(5). So R is at position 3, not 4. So that doesn't work.

We need R at position 4.

How about:

- ""BIRTH"": B, I, R, T, H -> again, R at position 3.

- ""DIRGE"": D, I, R, G, E -> E eliminated.

- ""FIRIE"": not a word.

- ""GIRLY"": G, I, R, L, Y -> R at position 3.

- ""HORNY"": H, O, R, N, Y -> O and N eliminated.

- ""LIRIP"": not a word.

- ""MIRZA"": M, I, R, Z, A -> A eliminated.

- ""MIRTH"" is not correct because R is at 3.

Another idea: ""QUICK"" is invalid because of C.

""QUIRK"" is not a word.

""BRINK"": B, R, I, N, K -> N eliminated.

""BRISK"": B, R, I, S, K -> S eliminated.

""CRIMP"": C eliminated.

""DRUID"": D, R, U, I, D -> R at position 2? Not 4.

We need to focus on words with R at position 4.

How about ""CURRY"": C eliminated.

""BURGH"": B, U, R, G, H -> R at position 3? Not 4.

""WORDY"": W, O, R, D, Y -> O eliminated.

""FORUM"": F, O, R, U, M -> O eliminated.

""LYRUM"": L, Y, R, U, M -> R at position 3? Not 4.

Position 4 is the fourth letter. So we need words where the fourth letter is R.

Examples:

- ""BURQA"": not a common word, and A eliminated.

- ""DIRRA"": not a word.

- ""FURCA"": not a word.

- ""HURRA"": not a word.

- ""MURA"": not 5 letters.

- ""PUREA"": not a word.

- ""TURMA"": not a word.

- ""WORRY"": W, O, R, R, Y -> O eliminated.

- ""CURRY"": C eliminated.

- ""SURFY"": not a word.

- ""HURRY"": H, U, R, R, Y -> this is a word. And it uses H, U, Y and has R at position 4? Let's see: 
  Position 1: H
  Position 2: U
  Position 3: R
  Position 4: R? No, position 4 is the fourth letter. In ""HURRY"", the letters are:
  H (1), U (2), R (3), R (4), Y (5)

So yes, R is at position 4. And the letters are H, U, R, R, Y. We have R at position 3 and 4. But we know R is at position 4, so the R at position 3 might be redundant? But we are testing R at position 4, and also we are testing H, U, Y.

But we are testing the same letter twice. If the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 3 might be marked as absent? But we know R is at position 4, so the R at position 3 might be considered as not present? Actually, the feedback marks each letter independently. But if the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 3 would be marked as absent (x) and the R at position 4 is correct.

But we are testing U and H as well.

However, we are testing the same letter twice, which might not be efficient.

But we have to use the available letters.

Another word: ""MURKY"" -> M, U, R, K, Y -> R is at position 3? Not 4.

""URBAN"": U, R, B, A, N -> A and N eliminated.

""URBEX"": not a word.

""UMBRA"": U, M, B, R, A -> A eliminated.

""UMBRA"" is invalid.

""DUVET"": D, U, V, E, T -> E and T eliminated.

""JUMPS"": J, U, M, P, S -> P and S eliminated.

""QUADS"": Q, U, A, D, S -> A and S eliminated.

This is difficult.

Another possibility: ""LURID"": L, U, R, I, D -> R at position 3? Not 4.

""RUDDY"": R, U, D, D, Y -> R at position 1? Not 4.

We need to focus on words that have R at position 4.

How about ""AURUM"" -> A eliminated.

""CURUM"" -> C eliminated.

""DUVET"" -> eliminated letters.

Perhaps ""MURKY"" is not working.

Another idea: ""HURRY"" is one valid word. And it uses H, U, Y. But we are testing two R's.

But we have to consider that the secret word might have two R's? We don't know.

Alternatively, we can try ""GIRTH"": G, I, R, T, H -> T eliminated.

""birth"" is B-I-R-T-H -> R at position 3.

""RHYME"": R at position 1, but E and H? E is eliminated.

""WHIRL"": W, H, I, R, L -> R at position 4? 
  Position 1: W
  Position 2: H
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: R
  Position 5: L

Yes! So ""WHIRL"" is a word (meaning: to make whirled or moved in a spiral). And it uses W, H, I, L.

And the letters are W, H, I, L, and R at position 4.

We haven't tried W, H, I, L. And we avoid the eliminated letters.

So this is a good candidate.

Another word: ""SHIRK"": S eliminated.

""THIRL"": not a word.

""WHIRL"" is valid.

Another one: ""CHIRP"": C eliminated.

""MYRRH"": as before, but R at position 4? M(1), Y(2), R(3), R(4), H(5) -> yes, R at 4.

But ""MYRRH"" is not a common word. ""HURRY"" is more common.

But ""HURRY"" has two R's. We can try ""WHIRL"" which has only one R and four new letters.

""WHIRL"": 
  W at 1, H at 2, I at 3, L at 5.

If the secret word has R at position 4, then we get a check for R at position 4. And we test W, H, I, L.

If the secret word does not have R at position 4, then we get a dash for R at position 4? But we know R is in the word, and we have R at position 4. If the secret word has R at position 4, then we get a check. If not, then we get a dash and we know R must be at position 1,3, or 5? But we have position 3 as I and position 5 as L. So if R is not at 4, then we get a dash for R at position 4, and then we know R must be at 1,3, or 5. And we test W, H, I, L.

So ""WHIRL"" seems good.

Another candidate: ""MIRTH"" is not because R is at 3.

""GRIMY"": G, R, I, M, Y -> R at position 2? Not 4.

""DRUID"": R at 2.

""CRIMP"": C eliminated.

""WRING"": N eliminated.

""BRING"": N eliminated.

""FRISK"": F, R, I, S, K -> S eliminated.

""CRISP"": C and S eliminated.

""TRIPY"": T eliminated.

""VIPER"": V, I, P, E, R -> P and E eliminated.

""UDDER"": U, D, D, E, R -> E eliminated.

""DAILY"": A eliminated.

""GUILT"": G, U, I, L, T -> T eliminated.

""QUILT"": same.

""BUILD"": B, U, I, L, D -> no R at position 4.

We need R at position 4.

Another word: ""CURVY"": C eliminated.

""LURCH"": L, U, R, C, H -> C eliminated.

""LYRCH"": not a word.

""MYRRH"": as before.

""YARNS"": Y, A, R, N, S -> A, N, S eliminated.

""YARKS"": same.

""YAWED"": Y, A, W, E, D -> A and E eliminated.

""YUCKS"": Y, U, C, K, S -> C and S eliminated.

""ZEBRA"": Z, E, B, R, A -> E and A eliminated.

""JUMPS"": P and S eliminated.

""QUADS"": A and S eliminated.

""QUAQU"": not 5 letters.

""QUICK"": C eliminated.

""QUIRK"": not a word.

""QUART"": A eliminated.

""QUART"" is 5 letters? Q-U-A-R-T, but A and T eliminated.

""QUASH"": S and A eliminated.

""QUASI"": not a word.

""QUAY"": not 5 letters.

""QUICK"" is out.

""QUILT"": Q, U, I, L, T -> T eliminated.

""QUINT"": Q, U, I, N, T -> N and T eliminated.

""QUIST"": not a word.

""QUIRL"": not a word.

""QUIRP"": not a word.

""QUICK"" is not.

Another idea: ""WHIRL"" is valid. Or ""WHIRL"" is valid.

""WHIRL"": W, H, I, R, L -> positions: 1:W, 2:H, 3:I, 4:R, 5:L.

We can use this.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have R at position 4, and we are testing W, H, I, L.

If we get feedback that R is correct at position 4, then we know. If not, then R must be at 1,3, or 5.

Also, we test W, H, I, L.

Alternatively, we can try ""MURKY"": M, U, R, K, Y -> R at position 3? Not 4.

""MYRRH"": M, Y, R, R, H -> R at position 3 and 4. So if we put R at position 4, we might get a check for that one and a dash for the other? But we are testing two R's.

But ""MYRRH"" is not a common word. ""HURRY"" is more common.

But ""HURRY"" has two R's. We can try ""WHIRL"" which has only one R and four new letters.

Another word: ""DUVET"" -> eliminated.

""BEIGY"": not a word.

""DEARY"": D, E, A, R, Y -> E and A eliminated.

""HEART"": H, E, A, R, T -> E, A, T eliminated.

""HERON"": H, E, R, O, N -> E, O, N eliminated.

""HEROY"": not a word.

""MERIT"": M, E, R, I, T -> E and T eliminated.

""MERIT"" is out.

""MYTHS"": M, Y, T, H, S -> T and S eliminated.

""MYRRH"": M, Y, R, R, H -> this is a word. But we are testing M, Y, H and the two R's.

But we are testing R at position 3 and 4. We know position 4 is R, so if position 3 is R and it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know position 3 is not R, and we have information about M, Y, H.

But we are testing two R's, which might not be efficient.

Alternatively, ""WHIRL"" tests four new letters and one R (at position 4).

I think ""WHIRL"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: 
  Position 1: W
  Position 2: H
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: R (which we know is correct, so we expect a check for R at 4)
  Position 5: L

We are testing W, H, I, L and also confirming R at 4.

If the secret word has R at position 4, then we get a check for R. If not, we get a dash and then we know R must be at 1,3, or 5. And we get feedback on W, H, I, L.

Moreover, ""WHIRL"" is a valid English word.

So I will go with ""WHIRL"".

But note: we have to make sure that the word is in the dictionary. I believe ""whirl"" is a valid word.

Therefore, the next guess is ""WHIRL"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R is in the word but not in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""sport"")**: R is correct at position 4. S, P, O, T are absent.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has **R in position 4** (pattern: `_ _ _ R _`).
- Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T** (cannot appear in the word).
- Remaining letters to test: **B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.
- Goal: Test new common letters while respecting the known R at position 4.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Choose a word that fits `_ _ _ R _` and uses only the remaining letters.
- Prioritize high-frequency letters from the remaining set (e.g., L, I, D, U, M, H) to maximize information.
- Avoid eliminated letters and duplicate letters (since we have no evidence of duplicates yet).

After evaluating possible words, **""WHIRL""** is selected because:
- It fits the pattern: `W H I R L` → R is at position 4.
- It tests four new common letters: **W, H, I, L** (all high-frequency and not yet tested).
- It avoids eliminated letters and has no duplicates.
- ""WHIRL"" is a valid English word (meaning: to move in a spiral or whirling).

This guess will:
- Confirm R at position 4 (we already know it's correct, so feedback will show ✓ for R).
- Provide new information about W, H, I, L: 
  - If any are correct (✓), misplaced (-), or absent (x), we narrow down possibilities significantly.

How about ""ROUST""? That\'s valid.\n\n But note: we have the letter U? We don\'t know about U. And we haven\'t tried S, T, L.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PRIOR"" but that has two R\'s? And we don\'t know if there are two R\'s. But the feedback for the first guess only showed one R? Actually, the feedback only marks the letters that are present.

It might have two.\n\n However, we don\'t have information about duplicates. So we can try a word with duplicate R? But we don\'t know.\n\n But to keep it simple, let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Another candidate: ""ROOMy"" - but that has two O\'s and we don\'t know about O.

But note: we have to avoid A, E, C, N. This word doesn\'t have those.\n\n However, we already know R is in the word, so we don\'t need to test R again? Actually, we do need to test R because we want to find its position. And we can test it in a new position.\n\n But note: in the first guess, R was at position 2. So we can try position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Let me try to choose a word that has R in a position that is not 2, and also includes other common letters.\n\n Common letters: S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\n I think ""ROUST"" is a good candidate: \n   R at 1 (new position), O, U, S, T are all new.\n\n But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid.

So we cannot use A.\n\n We must avoid A, E, C, N.\n\n So let me try ""DIRTY"": \n   D, I, R, T, Y. \n   R is at position 3. \n   This word avoids the forbidden letters.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if D, I, T, Y are in the word. And we are testing R at position 3.\n\n However, we also want to test more common letters. Let\'s compare:\n\n Option 1: ""ROUST"" -> tests R at 1, and letters O, U, S, T.\n Option 2: ""DIRTY"" -> tests R at 3, and letters D, I, T, Y.\n\n Both are valid. But ""ROUST"" uses more common letters? S and T are very common.\n\n However, we have to consider that the word might have S or T? We don\'t know.\n\n But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So the remaining common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.\n\n I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice because it tests R in a new position (1) and also tests S, T, O, U.\n\n But wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 1, we might get:\n   If R is at position 1: then we get a check for R.\n   If not, then we get a dash for R (meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 1) and then we know R must be at 3,4, or 5.\n\n Also, we test O, U, S, T.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROTLS"" but that\'s not a word. How about ""ROILS""? \n   ""ROILS"" is a word (meaning: to agitate). It has R at 1, and then O, I, L, S.\n\n But note: we are testing the same letters as ""ROUST"" but in different order? Actually, ""ROILS"" has R at 1, O at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.\n\n However, we know that the secret word does not have A, E, C, N. So we can use ""ROILS"".\n\n But let me check: we have not tried O, I, L, S. And we are testing R at position 1.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has R in a position that we haven\'t tried and also tests more common letters.\n\n Another candidate: ""SPORT"" -> S, P, O, R, T. But note: R is at position 4. This tests S, P, O, R, T. And we avoid the forbidden letters.\n\n However, we already know R is in the word, so we are testing S, P, O, T.\n\n But we are testing R at position 4. Also, we are testing S at position 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 5.\n\n This seems good.\n\n However, we must note that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n Option 1: ""ROUST"" -> tests R at 1, and letters O, U, S, T.\n Option 2: ""SPORT"" -> tests R at 4, and letters S, P, O, T.\n\n Both are good. But ""SPORT"" tests more common letters? S, T, O are common.\n\n But note: we have already eliminated A, E, C, N. So the remaining common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.\n\n I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice because it tests S, P, O, T and R at a new position (4). Also, it uses R at position 4 (which is one of the possibilities) and we get feedback on the other positions.\n\n However, we must be cautious: if the word has R at position 1, then in ""SPORT"" the R at position 4 would be marked as absent? Actually, no: the feedback marks each letter independently. But note: if the word has two R\'s, then if we put R in a position that is not present, it would be marked as dash if there is another R? Actually, the feedback is per letter occurrence. But we don\'t know if there are two R\'s.\n\n To avoid confusion, we might prefer a word without duplicate letters.\n\n So let me avoid duplicates.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""SPORT"" because it tests four new common letters (S, P, O, T) and R at position 4.\n\n But wait: we have to consider that the word might have R at position 1. So if we put R at position 4 and it is not correct, then we still don\'t know about position 1? Actually, we will know: if R is not at position 4, then we get a dash for R and we know R must be at 1,3, or 5. But we have tested position 4 and it was wrong, so then we can try position 1 in the next guess.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and also tests other common letters.\n\n How about ""RUSTS""? That has duplicate S. We don\'t want that.\n\n How about ""ROAST""? But A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word). So we cannot use A.\n\n How about ""ROBOT""? But B and T are new, but we have two O\'s? And we don\'t know about O. Also, we have to avoid A, E, C, N. This word doesn\'t have those, but it has two O\'s and two O\'s? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, O at 4, T at 5. But we are testing O twice? And we don\'t know if O is in the word.\n\n But we are testing R at position 1 and O at position 2? Also, we are testing B and T.\n\n However, we already know that the secret word does not have A, E, C, N. So we can use ""ROBOT"". But we are testing O twice? That might not be efficient.\n\n Alternatively, ""ROWDY"": R at 1, O at 2, W at 3, D at 4, Y at 5. This tests R at 1 and O at 2. But we don\'t test S or T.\n\n Since S and T are very common, I think including them is better.\n\n How about ""ROUST"" again? It tests R at 1, and also O, U, S, T.\n\n I think ""ROUST"" is a good choice.\n\n But note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter R and we are testing it at position 1. If it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know R must be in 3,4, or 5.\n\n Also, we test O, U, S, T.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""SPORT"" to test R at position 4 and also test S, P, O, T.\n\n I think both are reasonable. Let me pick ""SPORT"" because it tests S, P, O, T and R at a new position.\n\n But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are absent: C, A, N, E. ""SPORT"" does not contain any of these.\n\n So I will go with ""SPORT"".\n\n However, note: we have to consider that the word might have the letter R and we are testing it at position 4. If the R is at position 4, we get a check. If not, we get a dash and then we know R is at 1,3, or 5.\n\n Also, we get feedback on S, P, O, T.\n\n Let me write the guess: ""SPORT""\n\n But note: the feedback for the first guess told us that R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 4, we might get:\n\n   If R is at position 4: then we get a check for R.\n   If R is not at position 4, then we get a dash for R (meaning it\'s in the word but not at position 4) and then we know R must be at 1,3, or 5.\n\n Also, we test S at position 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 5.\n\n We might get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and also tests other common letters. For example, ""ROBOT"" is not ideal because of duplicate O.\n\n Another candidate: ""RUSTY"" -> R at 1, U at 2, S at 3, T at 4, Y at 5. This tests R at 1 and U, S, T, Y.\n\n But Y is less common.\n\n How about ""RISKY""? But that has S and K, but also I and Y. And R at 1.\n\n But we don\'t know if I is in the word.\n\n After considering, I think ""SPORT"" is a good choice.\n\n Let me check if ""SPORT"" is a valid word: yes.\n\n So I will guess ""SPORT"".\n\n But note: we have to make sure that we are not using any of the absent letters. We are not.\n\n Therefore, the next guess is ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- R is in the secret word but not in position 2.\n- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.\n\nFor the next guess, I need to:\n1. Include R (since it\'s confirmed in the word) but avoid position 2.\n2. Exclude C, A, N, E.\n3. Test new common letters to gather more information.\n\nI chose ""SPORT"" because:\n- R is placed in position 4 (a new position to test).\n- It introduces four new common letters: S, P, O, T.\n- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, A, N, E) and duplicates.\n- If R is in position 4, it will be marked correct; if not, the feedback will confirm R must be in position 1, 3, or 5, while providing info on S, P, O, T.\n\n<guess>sport</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) R(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n  C: x (not in the word)\n  R: - (in the word but wrong position; specifically, not at position 2)\n  A: x (not in the word)\n  N: x (not in the word)\n  E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: ""sport""\n  S: x (not in the word)\n  P: x (not in the word)\n  O: x (not in the word)\n  R: ✓ (correct, meaning R is in the word and in position 4)\n  T: x (not in the word)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n\n1.

But note: we have eliminated C and K? Actually, we haven\'t eliminated K. But wait, ""QUICK"" has C which is eliminated.

But we have R at position 4, which is good. But we are testing M, Y, H and also the second R? But we don\'t know if there is a second R.\n\nHowever, we are limited by the available letters. We must avoid the eliminated letters.\n\nBut note: we have not eliminated M, Y, H. So ""MYRRH"" is a valid word? Yes, but it has two R\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has two R\'s.

So we need a word with the fourth letter R.\n\nPattern: _ _ _ R _\n\nSo the word has the form: letter1, letter2, letter3, R, letter5.\n\nNow, letter1, letter2, letter3, and letter5 must be from the remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nAnd the word must be valid.\n\nSome possibilities:\n\n- ""MIRTH"": but H is at position 5?

So R is at position 3, not 4. So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe need R at position 4.\n\nHow about:\n\n- ""BIRTH"": B, I, R, T, H -> again, R at position 3.\n\n- ""DIRGE"": D, I, R, G, E -> E eliminated.\n\n- ""FIRIE"": not a word.\n\n- ""GIRLY"": G, I, R, L, Y -> R at position 3.\n\n- ""HORNY"": H, O, R, N, Y -> O and N eliminated.\n\n- ""LIRIP"": not a word.\n\n- ""MIRZA"": M, I, R, Z, A -> A eliminated.\n\n- ""MIRTH"" is not correct because R is at 3.\n\nAnother idea: ""QUICK"" is invalid because of C.\n\n""QUIRK"" is not a word.\n\n""BRINK"": B, R, I, N, K -> N eliminated.\n\n""BRISK"": B, R, I, S, K -> S eliminated.\n\n""CRIMP"": C eliminated.\n\n""DRUID"": D, R, U, I, D -> R at position 2?

In ""HURRY"", the letters are:\n  H (1), U (2), R (3), R (4), Y (5)\n\nSo yes, R is at position 4. And the letters are H, U, R, R, Y. We have R at position 3 and 4. But we know R is at position 4, so the R at position 3 might be redundant? But we are testing R at position 4, and also we are testing H, U, Y.\n\nBut we are testing the same letter twice. If the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 3 might be marked as absent? But we know R is at position 4, so the R at position 3 might be considered as not present? Actually, the feedback marks each letter independently. But if the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 3 would be marked as absent (x) and the R at position 4 is correct.\n\nBut we are testing U and H as well.\n\nHowever, we are testing the same letter twice, which might not be efficient.\n\nBut we have to use the available letters.\n\nAnother word: ""MURKY"" -> M, U, R, K, Y -> R is at position 3?

And it uses H, U, Y. But we are testing two R\'s.\n\nBut we have to consider that the secret word might have two R\'s? We don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""GIRTH"": G, I, R, T, H -> T eliminated.\n\n""birth"" is B-I-R-T-H -> R at position 3.\n\n""RHYME"": R at position 1, but E and H? E is eliminated.\n\n""WHIRL"": W, H, I, R, L -> R at position 4? \n  Position 1: W\n  Position 2: H\n  Position 3: I\n  Position 4: R\n  Position 5: L\n\nYes! So ""WHIRL"" is a word (meaning: to make whirled or moved in a spiral). And it uses W, H, I, L.\n\nAnd the letters are W, H, I, L, and R at position 4.\n\nWe haven\'t tried W, H, I, L. And we avoid the eliminated letters.\n\nSo this is a good candidate.\n\nAnother word: ""SHIRK"": S eliminated.\n\n""THIRL"": not a word.\n\n""WHIRL"" is valid.\n\nAnother one: ""CHIRP"": C eliminated.\n\n""MYRRH"": as before, but R at position 4? M(1), Y(2), R(3), R(4), H(5) -> yes, R at 4.\n\nBut ""MYRRH"" is not a common word. ""HURRY"" is more common.\n\nBut ""HURRY"" has two R\'s. We can try ""WHIRL"" which has only one R and four new letters.\n\n""WHIRL"": \n  W at 1, H at 2, I at 3, L at 5.\n\nIf the secret word has R at position 4, then we get a check for R at position 4. And we test W, H, I, L.\n\nIf the secret word does not have R at position 4, then we get a dash for R at position 4? But we know R is in the word, and we have R at position 4. If the secret word has R at position 4, then we get a check. If not, then we get a dash and we know R must be at position 1,3, or 5? But we have position 3 as I and position 5 as L. So if R is not at 4, then we get a dash for R at position 4, and then we know R must be at 1,3, or 5.

But we are testing two R\'s.\n\nBut ""MYRRH"" is not a common word. ""HURRY"" is more common.\n\nBut ""HURRY"" has two R\'s.

I believe ""whirl"" is a valid word.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""WHIRL"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R is in the word but not in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (""sport"")**: R is correct at position 4. S, P, O, T are absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word has **R in position 4** (pattern: `_ _ _ R _`).\n- Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T** (cannot appear in the word).\n- Remaining letters to test: **B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.\n- Goal: Test new common letters while respecting the known R at position 4.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- Choose a word that fits `_ _ _ R _` and uses only the remaining letters.\n- Prioritize high-frequency letters from the remaining set (e.g., L, I, D, U, M, H) to maximize information.\n- Avoid eliminated letters and duplicate letters (since we have no evidence of duplicates yet).\n\nAfter evaluating possible words, **""WHIRL""** is selected because:\n- It fits the pattern: `W H I R L` → R is at position 4.\n- It tests four new common letters: **W, H, I, L** (all high-frequency and not yet tested).\n- It avoids eliminated letters and has no duplicates.\n- ""WHIRL"" is a valid English word (meaning: to move in a spiral or whirling).\n\nThis guess will:\n- Confirm R at position 4 (we already know it\'s correct, so feedback will show ✓ for R).\n- Provide new information about W, H, I, L: \n  - If any are correct (✓), misplaced (-), or absent (x), we narrow down possibilities significantly.\n\n<guess>whirl</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) R(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: whirl -> FEEDBACK: W(x) H(x) I(-) R(✓) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Incorrect format think\n\n<guess>Incorrect format answer</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) R(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: whirl -> FEEDBACK: W(x) H(x) I(-) R(✓) L(x)\nModel answer is not in the correct format\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Incorrect format think\n\n<guess>Incorrect format answer</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) R(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: whirl -> FEEDBACK: W(x) H(x) I(-) R(✓) L(x)\nModel answer is not in the correct format\nModel answer is not in the correct format\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for Guess 3: ""whirl"" -> W(x) H(x) I(-) R(✓) L(x)
 This means:
   W is not in the word (x)
   H is not in the word (x)
   I is in the word but not in position 3 (since it's marked as misplaced) (-)
   R is correct at position 4 (✓)
   L is not in the word (x)

So, from all feedback so far:

Correct positions:
   Position 4: R

Misplaced letters:
   I is in the word, but not at position 3.

Absent letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T, W, H, L (from all x's in all guesses)

Therefore, the secret word has:
   - R at position 4.
   - The letter I is present, but not at position 3.
   - And the word does not contain: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T, W, H, L.

Now, the remaining letters to consider are: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z. But note that I is already confirmed to be in the word (though not at position 3).

We know the word has I, and it must be at position 1, 2, or 5 (since position 3 is wrong and position 4 is R).

We also know the word has no other letters from the absent list.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
   - Has R at position 4.
   - Contains the letter I (but not at position 3).
   - Uses only letters from the remaining set: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z. (Note: I is already included, so we can use it once.)

But note: we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, we have no evidence of duplicates, so we assume no duplicates for now.

We must avoid the absent letters.

Now, let's think of words that fit:

Pattern: _ _ _ R _

And the word must contain I (somewhere except position 3).

Possible positions for I: 1, 2, or 5.

Let's try to think of words:

Option 1: I at position 1.
   Pattern: I _ _ R _

   ""NURDS"": N, U, R, D, S -> N, S eliminated.

   ""NURSE"" is out.

   ""MURKY"": M, U, R, K, Y -> but we have R at position 3? Not 4.

   ""MURKY"" is M-U-R-K-Y, so R at position 3.

We need R at position 4.

How about ""MURKY"" with R at 3 is not useful.

""BURLY"": B, U, R, L, Y -> L eliminated.

""CURVY"": C eliminated.

""DUVET"": D, U, V, E, T -> E and T eliminated.

""FERRY"": F, E, R, R, Y -> E eliminated.

""HEROY"": not a word.

""MERIT"": M, E, R, I, T -> E and T eliminated.

""MERIT"" is out.

""MYRRH"": M, Y, R, R, H -> H eliminated? And R at position 3 and 4? But we need R at position 4, and position 3 is also R? So if we put ""MYRRH"", then position 4 is R, but position 3 is also R? That might be confusing.

But we know R is at position 4, so if we put R at position 4, we get a check. If we put R at position 3 and 4, then position 4 R is correct, but position 3 R might be marked as absent if the word has only one R? But we don't know.

But we are trying to find the word, so we can consider ""MYRRH"" as a candidate? But it has H and two R's.

But H is eliminated (from guess3: H is not in the word).

So ""MYRRH"" is invalid because H is out.

Similarly, ""MYRRH"" has H which is out.

Another word: ""GIRLY"": G, I, R, L, Y -> L eliminated.

""RIGID"": R at position 1? But we have R at position 4, so if we put R at position 1, that's a different position. But we know R is at position 4, so if we put R at position 1, it would be marked as misplaced (if the word has only one R) or correct (if two R's) but we don't know.

But we are trying to find the word, so we can consider words that have R at position 4 and contain I.

How about ""QUIRK"": not a word.

""BRICK"": B, R, I, C, K -> C eliminated.

""PRICK"": P eliminated.
