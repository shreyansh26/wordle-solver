We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

 This tells us:
 - The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5). So the secret word ends with E.
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

 Since we know the word ends with E, and we have 4 letters that are not in the word, we can try to think of a new word that:
 - Ends with E (so the fifth letter is E)
 - Does not contain C, R, A, N.

 We also want to use common letters to get more information.

 Let's consider common consonants that are not C, R, A, N. Some common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, M, P, etc.

 We can try a word that has a mix of these common letters and ends with E.

 Example words: 
   ""SLATE"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word) and T is common.
   ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> but we don't know about these.

 However, note that we must avoid A, C, R, N.

 Let's think of words ending with E that do not contain A, C, R, N.

 Some possibilities:
   ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E
   ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E
   ""STYLE"" -> S, T, Y, L, E
   ""SMITE"" -> S, M, I, T, E

 We also want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Since we have only one letter fixed (E at the end), we can try to test multiple common letters.

 Let's choose ""STOLE"" because it has S, T, O, L which are common and we avoid the forbidden letters.

 But note: we are not sure if any of these are in the word. We are trying to get more information.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has a double E? But we don't know if there is another E.

 However, the feedback for the first word didn't show any other E (but we only had one E at the end). So it's possible there is another E? 
 But note: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we only had one E, we don't know about other positions.

 But we must avoid using the same letter twice unless we suspect it? Since we don't have any indication of a double E, we can use distinct letters.

 Let's go with ""STOLE"".

 However, note that the word must be a valid 5-letter word.

 But wait: we know that the word has an E at the end, and we are avoiding A, C, R, N. So ""STOLE"" is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, we could use ""SPITE"", but that has only 4 distinct letters? Actually, ""SPITE"" has S, P, I, T, E -> all distinct.

 But let me check: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels? We know that A is not in the word, so the vowels in the word might be E (at the end) and possibly O, I, U? 

 We haven't tested O, I, U. So including a word that has O, I, U would be good.

 However, we also want to test common consonants. Let's compare:

 Option 1: ""STOLE"" -> tests S, T, O, L (and we already know E is at the end)
 Option 2: ""SPITE"" -> tests S, P, I, T (and E at the end)

 Both are good. But note that we have already eliminated A, so we are safe.

 I think ""SPITE"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (O and I) and three consonants (S, P, T) that we haven't tested.

 But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are not present: C, R, A, N. Both words avoid these.

 Let me choose ""SPITE"". However, note that the feedback for the first word didn't have any yellow (wrong position) for the other letters? But we don't have any other information.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has the E at the end and uses new letters.

 I'll go with ""SPITE"".

 But note: the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""SPITE"" is a valid word.

 So the next guess: ""SPITE""

 However, let me double-check: we know the word has an E at the end, and we are avoiding A, C, R, N. So ""SPITE"" is acceptable.

 Alternatively, we could use ""SLIME"", but that has M and I, and L. But note: we don't know about L, M, I, S.

 But we are trying to cover more common letters. The letters in ""SPITE"" are S, P, I, T, E. 

 Another option: ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E. But Q is less common and we might not want to use it.

 Since we are in the second guess, we can try to get as much information as possible.

 But note: we have only one letter fixed (E at the end). So we are trying to figure out the first four letters.

 We can also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any evidence of that.

 Let me choose ""SPITE"".

 However, note that the word ""SPITE"" might not be the only possibility. But we are trying to get feedback.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has more vowels? We know that A is out, so the vowels are likely E (at the end) and possibly O, I, U. So including O and I might be good.

 But ""SPITE"" only has I. 

 Another word: ""SOOTE"" -> but that's not a common word? Actually, ""SOOTE"" is not valid.

 How about ""SLICE""? But we know C is not in the word (from the first feedback: C was x) so we cannot use C.

 We must avoid C, R, A, N.

 So let me think of words ending in E that do not contain C, R, A, N and use common letters.

 I'll go with ""SPITE"" because it uses S, P, I, T which are common.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has S, P, I, T. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we could use ""STOLE"" (S, T, O, L) but we are avoiding O? Actually, we haven't tested O and we know the word must have vowels. Since A is out, the vowels are likely E, O, I, U. So testing O and I might be good.

 But ""STOLE"" tests O and L, while ""SPITE"" tests I and T.

 Since T is more common than L, maybe ""SPITE"" is better.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have two E's? But we don't have any indication of that.

 After thinking, I'll go with ""SPITE"".

 But wait: what if the word is ""QUITE""? We wouldn't know. But we are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has O and I? But we have to avoid the forbidden letters.

 I think ""SPITE"" is a reasonable guess.

 However, note that the word ""SPITE"" might be the actual word? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can use ""SLIME"" to test S, L, I, M. But M is less common than T? 

 Let me check the frequency of letters. In English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know A and N are out. So T, O, I, S, L are good.

 We can try to cover T, O, I, S, L? But we have only 4 positions (since the last is E). So we can test 4 new letters.

 But note: we are constrained by the word having 5 letters and ending with E.

 I think ""SPITE"" is a good choice because it tests S, P, I, T.

 So I'll go with ""SPITE"".

 But wait: what if the word has a double letter? We don't know. But we are not using double letters in this guess.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""SPITE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **E** is correct and in position 5 (so the secret word ends with **E**).
- **C, R, A, N** are absent from the word entirely.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with **E**.
- It should avoid **C, R, A, N**.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **S, T, O, I, P**) to maximize information.

I chose **SPITE** because:
- It ends with **E**.
- It avoids forbidden letters.
- It tests 4 new high-frequency consonants/vowels (**S, P, I, T**).
- It is a valid 5-letter word.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 We also want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Since we have only one letter fixed (E at the end), we can try to test multiple common letters.

 Let's choose ""STOLE"" because it has S, T, O, L which are common and we avoid the forbidden letters.

 But note: we are not sure if any of these are in the word. We are trying to get more information.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has a double E? But we don't know if there is another E.

 However, the feedback for the first word didn't show any other E (but we only had one E at the end). So it's possible there is another E? 
 But note: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we only had one E, we don't know about other positions.

 But we must avoid using the same letter twice unless we suspect it? Since we don't have any indication of a double E, we can use distinct letters.

 Let's go with ""STOLE"".

 However, note that the word must be a valid 5-letter word.

 But wait: we know that the word has an E at the end, and we are avoiding A, C, R, N. So ""STOLE"" is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, we could use ""SPITE"", but that has only 4 distinct letters? Actually, ""SPITE"" has S, P, I, T, E -> all distinct.

 But let me check: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels? We know that A is not in the word, so the vowels in the word might be E (at the end) and possibly O, I, U? 

 We haven't tested O, I, U. So including a word that has O, I, U would be good.

 However, we also want to test common consonants. Let's compare:

 Option 1: ""STOLE"" -> tests S, T, O, L (and we already know E is at the end)
 Option 2: ""SPITE"" -> tests S, P, I, T (and E at the end)

 Both are good. But note that we have already eliminated A, so we are safe.

 I think ""SPITE"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (O and I) and three consonants (S, P, T) that we haven't tested.

 But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are not present: C, R, A, N. Both words avoid these.

 Let me choose ""SPITE"". However, note that the feedback for the first word didn't have any yellow (wrong position) for the other letters? But we don't have any other information.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has the E at the end and uses new letters.

 I'll go with ""SPITE"".

 But note: the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""SPITE"" is a valid word.

 So the next guess: ""SPITE""

 However, let me double-check: we know the word has an E at the end, and we are avoiding A, C, R, N. So ""SPITE"" is acceptable.

 Alternatively, we could use ""SLIME"", but that has M and I, and L. But note: we don't know about L, M, I, S.

 But we are trying to cover more common letters. The letters in ""SPITE"" are S, P, I, T, E. 

 Another option: ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E. But Q is less common and we might not want to use it.

 Since we are in the second guess, we can try to get as much information as possible.

 But note: we have only one letter fixed (E at the end). So we are trying to figure out the first four letters.

 We can also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any evidence of that.

 Let me choose ""SPITE"".

 However, note that the word ""SPITE"" might not be the only possibility. But we are trying to get feedback.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has more vowels? We know that A is out, so the vowels are likely E (at the end) and possibly O, I, U. So including O and I might be good.

 But ""SPITE"" only has I. 

 Another word: ""SOOTE"" -> but that's not a common word? Actually, ""SOOTE"" is not valid.

 How about ""SLICE""? But we know C is not in the word (from the first feedback: C was x) so we cannot use C.

 We must avoid C, R, A, N.

 So let me think of words ending in E that do not contain C, R, A, N and use common letters.

 I'll go with ""SPITE"" because it uses S, P, I, T which are common.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has S, P, I, T. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we could use ""STOLE"" (S, T, O, L) but we are avoiding O? Actually, we haven't tested O and we know the word must have vowels. Since A is out, the vowels are likely E, O, I, U. So testing O and I might be good.

 But ""STOLE"" tests O and L, while ""SPITE"" tests I and T.

 Since T is more common than L, maybe ""SPITE"" is better.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have two E's? But we don't have any indication of that.

 After thinking, I'll go with ""SPITE"".

 But wait: what if the word is ""QUITE""? We wouldn't know. But we are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has O and I? But we have to avoid the forbidden letters.

 I think ""SPITE"" is a reasonable guess.

 However, note that the word ""SPITE"" might be the actual word? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can use ""SLIME"" to test S, L, I, M. But M is less common than T? 

 Let me check the frequency of letters. In English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know A and N are out. So T, O, I, S, L are good.

 We can try to cover T, O, I, S, L? But we have only 4 positions (since the last is E). So we can test 4 new letters.

 But note: we are constrained by the word having 5 letters and ending with E.

 I think ""SPITE"" is a good choice because it tests S, P, I, T.

 So I'll go with ""SPITE"".

 But wait: what if the word has a double letter? We don't know. But we are not using double letters in this guess.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""SPITE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **E** is correct and in position 5 (so the secret word ends with **E**).
- **C, R, A, N** are absent from the word entirely.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with **E**.
- It should avoid **C, R, A, N**.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **S, T, O, I, P**) to maximize information.

I chose **SPITE** because:
- It ends with **E**.
- It avoids forbidden letters.
- It tests 4 new high-frequency consonants/vowels (**S, P, I, T**).
- It is a valid 5-letter word.

We are given feedback for two guesses:

1. ""crane"": 
   C: x (not in the word)
   R: x (not in the word)
   A: x (not in the word)
   N: x (not in the word)
   E: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so the word ends with E)

2. ""spite"":
   S: x (not in the word)
   P: x (not in the word)
   I: - (in the word but wrong position)
   T: x (not in the word)
   E: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so the word ends with E)

From this, we know:
- The word ends with E (position 5 is E).
- The letter I is in the word, but not in position 3 (since in ""spite"", I was in position 3 and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, S, P, T.

We also know that the word contains I (somewhere except position 3) and E (at position 5).

Now, we need to make a third guess. The word structure is: _ _ _ _ E

We know the word has an I, but not in position 3. So I could be in position 1, 2, or 4.

We must avoid the letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, T.

We have 6 tries, so we can try to test more common letters.

We need to choose a word that:
- Ends with E (so position 5 is E)
- Contains I (but not in position 3)
- Avoids C, R, A, N, S, P, T
- Uses new letters to get more information

Common letters we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many of these as possible, especially vowels (O, U, etc.) and common consonants (L, D, M, etc.).

Since we know I is in the word, we can try to place I in a different position (like 1, 2, or 4) and test other common letters.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern: _ _ _ _ E, and include I (but not in position 3), and avoid the forbidden letters.

Possible positions for I:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ E
- Position 2: _ I _ _ E
- Position 4: _ _ _ I E

We also need to test other letters.

Let's try to test O, L, D, M, etc.

Example words:

Option 1: Place I in position 1 and test other letters.
For example: ""IMAGE"" -> but A is forbidden (we know A is not in the word) so invalid.
""INANE"" -> but N and A are forbidden -> invalid.
""IDLER"" -> but R is forbidden -> invalid.

We must avoid A, C, R, N, S, P, T.

So let's try:

- Position 1: I _ _ _ E
  - We need three letters for positions 2,3,4 that are not forbidden and form a valid word.
  - Example: ""ISLE"" -> but S and L? S is forbidden (from ""spite"" feedback: S was x) so we cannot use S.
  - ""IDLER"" is invalid because of R.
  - ""IGLOO"" -> no E at the end? It ends with O, not E. So not.

We need words ending with E. So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E.

With I in position 1: 
  ""INLET"" -> but N and T are forbidden -> invalid.
  ""IMPEL"" -> but P and L? P is forbidden -> invalid.
  ""IDYLL"" -> not ending with E and contains Y, but also not 5 distinct? Actually, ""IDYLL"" ends with L, not E.

It's hard to find a word with I at the start and ending with E without using forbidden letters.

Try I in position 2: 
  _ I _ _ E
  Example: ""TITLE"" -> but T is forbidden -> invalid.
  ""BIBLE"" -> B, I, B, L, E -> but B is repeated? And we don't know if B is in the word. Also, we have two B's? But we can test B and L.
  However, we must avoid forbidden letters: T is forbidden, but B and L are allowed? Yes, because we haven't tested them.

But note: ""BIBLE"" has two B's. We don't know if the secret word has B or not. But it's a valid word.

But we are trying to get information. However, repeating B might not be efficient.

Another: ""DICEY"" -> but C is forbidden and doesn't end with E? It ends with Y.

We need words ending with E.

Another idea: ""QUITE"" -> but Q, U, I, T, E. But T is forbidden (from ""spite"" feedback: T was x) so we cannot use T.

T is forbidden? Yes, from the feedback of ""spite"": T was marked x.

So we cannot use T.

Similarly, S, P are forbidden.

So let's list forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, T.

We can use: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, for I: we know it's in the word, so we must include it.

Let me try to form a word with I and other common letters.

Option: ""OILED"" -> O, I, L, E, D? But wait, the pattern: position 1: O, 2: I, 3: L, 4: E, 5: D? But we need the fifth letter to be E, so that doesn't work.

We need the word to end with E. So the fifth letter is fixed as E.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E

With I in position 2: 
  _ I _ _ E
  Possible words: 
    ""BIBLE"" -> B I B L E -> but two B's and we test B and L.
    ""TITLE"" -> T is forbidden -> invalid.
    ""DICEY"" -> doesn't end with E and has C -> invalid.
    ""LINED"" -> but N is forbidden -> invalid.
    ""MIXED"" -> M I X E D -> but ends with D? No, we need E at the end. ""MIXED"" has E at position 4? Actually, it's M-I-X-E-D, so E is at position 4, D at 5. We need E at 5? So no.

We need the fifth letter to be E. So the word must be: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E.

With I in position 2: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] E.

We can try:
  ""BIKE"" -> too short? 5 letters? No, ""BIKE"" is 4 letters.
  ""BIKER"" -> 5 letters? But ends with R, not E.

Actually, we need 5 letters and ending with E.

Let me think: 
  ""WIPED"" -> W I P E D -> but P is forbidden (from ""spite"") and also ends with D? No, we need E at the end. ""WIPED"" has E at position 4? Actually, W-I-P-E-D: positions: 1:W, 2:I, 3:P, 4:E, 5:D -> so E is at 4, D at 5. Not E at 5.

We need the fifth letter to be E. So the word must be: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E.

So for I in position 2: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] E.

Examples:
  ""QUITE"" -> but T is forbidden -> invalid.
  ""JUICE"" -> J U I C E -> but C is forbidden -> invalid.
  ""GUISE"" -> G U I S E -> but S is forbidden -> invalid.
  ""GUIDE"" -> G U I D E -> but we have E at the end? Yes: G-U-I-D-E -> positions: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E. But wait, we have I in position 3? But in the feedback for ""spite"", I was in position 3 and got a '-' meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong? But we are allowed to guess the same word? We are not forced to avoid repeating a known letter? Actually, we know I is in the word but not in position 3, so if we put I in position 3 again, we know it will be marked as '-' again? But we are trying to get new information. It's better to try I in a new position.

But note: we are allowed to guess the same word? But we know I is in the word, but we don't know its position. So we should try I in a position we haven't tried (i.e., not position 3) to see if it fits.

In ""spite"", I was in position 3. So we can try position 1, 2, or 4.

But in the pattern _ _ _ _ E, if we put I in position 2, then we have: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] E.

We need a valid word that fits: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] E.

Possible words:
  ""BIBLE"" -> B I B L E -> but has two B's. And we don't know about B and L. But we are testing B and L. Also, note that the second letter is I and the last is E.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters: B, L are not forbidden? Yes, because we haven't eliminated them.

But the word ""BIBLE"" has two B's. If the secret word has only one B, then the feedback for the B's might be tricky? But it's allowed.

Alternatively, we can try a word without repeated letters.

What about ""WIDEN""? But ends with N, not E? And N is forbidden.

""GUIDE"": G U I D E -> but in this case, I is in position 3? Actually, position 3 is I? Then we have: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E. But we know I is not in position 3? From the feedback of ""spite"", we know that I is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3 again, we know it will be marked as '-' again? But we are trying to get new information. It's better to try I in a new position.

So we should avoid position 3 for I.

Therefore, for the next guess, we can try I in position 1, 2, or 4.

Let me try to find words with I in position 1, 2, or 4.

With I in position 1: 
  I _ _ _ E
  Examples: 
    ""IMAGE"" -> A forbidden -> no.
    ""INLET"" -> N and T forbidden -> no.
    ""ISLE"" -> S forbidden -> no.
    ""IDLER"" -> R forbidden -> no.
    ""IGLOE"" -> not a word? 
    ""INNED"" -> N forbidden -> no.

It's hard. Let me think of common words.

How about ""IMBUE""? But ends with U, not E.

We need to end with E.

Another: ""INVITE"" -> 6 letters? No.

""ILLUS"" -> not ending with E.

Perhaps ""IMPEL"" -> but P and L? P is forbidden.

I'm struggling. Let me try I in position 4: 
  _ _ _ I E
  Examples:
    ""MOVIE"" -> M O V I E -> but we have E at the end? Yes: M-O-V-I-E -> positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:V, 4:I, 5:E. 
    This word: ""MOVIE"" -> M, O, V, I, E. 
    Avoids forbidden letters? Yes: M, O, V, I, E. 
    But we have I in position 4? That's a new position.

Also, we test M, O, V, and we already know I and E.

But note: we are testing O and V? And M.

This seems good.

Another possibility: ""DIVIE"" -> not a word? 
""QUITE"" is invalid because of T.

""MOVIE"" is a valid word.

We can also consider ""OZONE"" -> but doesn't have I and ends with E? O-Z-O-N-E -> no I, and N is forbidden.

We must include I because we know it's in the word.

So ""MOVIE"" is a candidate.

With I in position 2: 
  _ I _ _ E
  ""GUIDE"" -> G U I D E -> but I is in position 3? Actually, position 3 is I? Then we have: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E -> so I is in position 3. But we know I is not in position 3? So we shouldn't put I in position 3 again? Actually, we can, but we know it will be marked as '-' again? So it's a waste of a position? We want to test new positions.

But we are forced to have the fifth letter E. So we can try I in position 2.

Word: ""DICEY"" -> doesn't end with E.

""LIGHT"" -> no E.

""BIKIE"" -> not standard.

""MIKVE"" -> not a word.

Perhaps ""LIVED"" -> L I V E D -> but ends with D? Not E.

It's difficult to find a word with I in position 2 and ending with E.

What about ""WIPED"" -> W I P E D -> ends with D? No.

""MINCE"" -> M I N C E -> but N and C are forbidden -> invalid.

""WINCE"" -> W I N C E -> forbidden letters.

So maybe position 2 is hard.

Position 1: 
  I _ _ _ E
  ""ITCHY"" -> ends with Y? Not E.
  ""IMPLY"" -> ends with Y? Not E.
  ""INBOX"" -> no E.

How about ""INURE"" -> but R and N forbidden -> invalid.

I think position 1 is not easy.

Position 4:
  _ _ _ I E
  ""MOVIE"" -> M O V I E -> as above.

Another: ""HAPPY"" -> no E and forbidden A.

""JUMBO"" -> no E.

""LUCRE"" -> R forbidden -> no.

""MOVIE"" seems good.

But note: we are testing O, V, M. 

We could also try ""DIVIE"" -> not a word.

""QUINE"" -> Q U I N E -> but N is forbidden -> invalid.

""QUITE"" -> T forbidden -> invalid.

So ""MOVIE"" is a valid option.

But let me check: ""MOVIE"" -> M O V I E. 
- Position 1: M
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: V
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: E (fixed)

We know I is in the word, and we are putting it in position 4. If the secret word has I in position 4, we get a ✓ for I? Or if not, we get a '-' or 'x'. But we know I is in the word, so it won't be 'x'. It could be '-' if it's in the word but not in position 4, or ✓ if it is in position 4.

Also, we test M, O, V.

Another candidate: ""OILED"" -> O I L E D -> but ends with D? Not E.

""TIMED"" -> T forbidden -> no.

""VIMEN"" -> not a word.

""MOVIE"" seems a good choice.

But note: we are not sure if O, V, M are in the word. We are testing them.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 1 or 2 and uses more common letters.

What about ""LIVE?"" -> 4 letters.

""IVEY"" -> 4 letters.

""OBIED"" -> not a word.

I think ""MOVIE"" is acceptable.

But let me see if there is a word with I in position 1 and ending with E without forbidden letters.

For example: ""INLET"" is invalid.

""ICED"" -> 4 letters.

""IDLER"" is invalid.

""IMPEL"" invalid.

""IMBUE"" -> ends with U.

""IMPLY"" -> ends with Y.

""INURE"" invalid.

""IVIED"" -> not a word? ""IVIED"" is not standard.

""OILER"" -> but ends with R? Not E, and R is forbidden.

""OILIE"" -> not a word.

So ""MOVIE"" might be one of the few options.

Another word: ""DIVIE"" -> not a word.

""JIVED"" -> J I V E D -> ends with D? Not E.

""JIGED"" -> not a word.

""KITED"" -> not a word.

""LIVED"" -> not a word.

""WIVED"" -> not a word.

So ""MOVIE"" is a valid word.

But note: we are testing V and O? And M.

Alternatively, we can try ""MOIRE"" -> M O I R E -> but R is forbidden -> invalid.

""NOISE"" -> N and S forbidden -> no.

""VOICE"" -> V O I C E -> C is forbidden -> invalid.

So I think ""MOVIE"" is a reasonable guess.

But wait, we have to consider that the word might have I in position 4? Or position 2? We are testing position 4.

If we get feedback that I is in the word but not in position 4, then we know it must be in position 1 or 2? But we are testing position 4.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 1 or 2.

But we couldn't find a common word with I in position 1 and ending with E without forbidden letters.

What about ""DWINE"" -> not a word.

""EXILE"" -> E X I L E -> but we have E at the beginning? And then I in position 3? But we are avoiding position 3 for I? Actually, we are forced to have I somewhere. But in ""EXILE"", I is in position 3? Then we know that position 3 is not I? But we are trying to test a new position? Actually, we are repeating position 3? We know I is not in position 3, so if we put I in position 3 again, we know it will be marked as '-' again? So it's inefficient.

But we are allowed to do that? But we are not learning new information about I's position.

We want to know where I is. So we should try it in a new position.

Therefore, ""MOVIE"" has I in position 4, which is new.

Another word: ""GIVEN"" -> G I V E N -> but N is forbidden -> invalid.

""LIKEN"" -> L I K E N -> N forbidden -> invalid.

""MIXED"" -> M I X E D -> ends with D? No.

""WIFED"" -> not a word.

So ""MOVIE"" is one of the few.

But note: there is ""BICEP"" -> but C and P forbidden -> no.

""FIELD"" -> ends with D.

""VIELD"" -> ends with D.

""HELIX"" -> ends with X.

""HELLO"" -> ends with O.

I think ""MOVIE"" is acceptable.

But let me check if there is a word with I in position 2.

For example: ""TITLE"" -> T forbidden.

""BIOME"" -> B I O M E -> ends with E? Yes: B-I-O-M-E -> positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:O, 4:M, 5:E. 
This word: ""BIOME"" -> B, I, O, M, E.
- Avoids forbidden letters? Yes: B, I, O, M, E. 
- I is in position 2, which is new.

And we test B, O, M.

This is also a valid word.

So we have two candidates: ""MOVIE"" (I in position 4) and ""BIOME"" (I in position 2).

Which one is better? Both test 4 new letters.

But we have to consider letter frequency.

Common letters: L, O, D, M, B, etc.

""BIOME"" tests B, O, M, and I (which we know) and E (known). 
""MOVIE"" tests M, O, V, and I, E.

V is less common than B? So ""BIOME"" might be better because B and O are more common.

But we don't know.

Another word: ""OZONE"" -> no I.

""URINE"" -> U R I N E -> R and N forbidden -> invalid.

""HELIX"" -> ends with X.

""HELLO"" -> ends with O.

""JUMBO"" -> no E.

I think both ""BIOME"" and ""MOVIE"" are acceptable.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both avoid them.

Let me choose ""BIOME"" because it tests B and O, which are common.

But we have to consider that the word might have O? We don't know.

Alternatively, we can try ""OILED"" but it doesn't end with E? It ends with D.

""OILED"" is O-I-L-E-D -> ends with D.

So not.

Another word: ""OXIDE"" -> O X I D E -> but we have I in position 3? Then we know position 3 is not I? And we are testing O and X? But X is rare.

But ""OXIDE"" is a word: O-X-I-D-E -> positions: 1:O, 2:X, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E. But we know I is not in position 3, so we know that will be '-' again. So we are testing O, X, D.

But X is rare, so maybe not.

""MOVIE"" is more common.

But let me see: we have to include I and E (at the end). So we are including I and E, and testing three new letters.

We can also consider ""DIVIE"" -> not a word.

""VIXEN"" -> V I X E N -> but N is forbidden -> invalid.

""VIMEN"" -> not a word.

So between ""BIOME"" and ""MOVIE"", I think ""MOVIE"" is more common and uses more common letters? M, O, V, I, E.

But V is less common. B is more common than V? In English, B is more common than V.

Letter frequency: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... then C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, ...

So M is more common than V, and B is more common than M? Actually, B is more common than M and V? Let me recall: 
Common letters: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... 
We have eliminated A, T, R, N, S, P. So the next common are: O, I, D, L, U, then M, F, Y, W, G, B, V, K.

So B is more common than V and M? Actually, B is about 1.7%, M is 2.4%, V is 2.1%. So B is more common than M and V.

But we are testing 4 letters: two of which are I and E, and two more.

In ""BIOME"": tests B, I, O, M, E -> B:1.7%, O:7.5%, M:2.4%, I:7.5%, E:12.7% (but we already know E is in, so we are testing the position of E? But we know E is at the end, so we are confirming that? Actually, we already know E is at the end, so we don't need to test E again? But we are using it to complete the word.

But we are allowed to reuse a known letter? Yes, but we know E is in the word and at the end, so we should keep it? Actually, we can change the position of E? But we know E is at the end, so we should keep it at the end? Not necessarily. We can test if there is another E? But we don't have any indication of another E. But we can use a word that has E in a different position? But we know the word has at least one E (at the end). If we put E in position 4, for example, we might get feedback if there is another E.

But in ""MOVIE"", we have E only at the end? So we are testing the E at the end, which we know is correct. We are not testing for another E.

In ""BIOME"", we have E at the end and also at position 4? No, ""BIOME"" has E at the end and no other E? Actually, ""BIOME"" has only one E? But we don't know if there is another E. The word ""BIOME"" has E at the end, and the middle has O, M, B. No other E.

""MOVIE"" has E only at the end? Actually, ""MOVIE"" is M-O-V-I-E, so only one E (at the end). But we are testing position 4 for I.

But we are not testing for another E.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has E in position 4? But we don't know if there is an E in position 4.

For example, ""OPINE"" -> O P I N E -> but P and N are forbidden -> invalid.

""URINE"" -> forbidden letters.

""EXILE"" -> forbidden letters.

""AXIOM"" -> no E and A forbidden.

I think ""MOVIE"" is fine.

But let me see if there is a word with I in position 1 and ending with E without forbidden letters.

For example: ""INLET"" invalid.

""ICED"" invalid.

""IDLER"" invalid.

""IMBUE"" -> ends with U.

""IMPLY"" -> ends with Y.

""INURE"" invalid.

""IVIED"" -> not a word.

""OBIED"" -> not a word.

""OGEED"" -> not a word.

""OILED"" -> ends with D.

""OMINE"" -> not a word.

""OLIVE"" -> O L I V E -> but I is in position 3? Then we know position 3 is not I? And we are testing O and L and V. But I is in position 3 again? So we get feedback on I: it will be '-' again? And we know that. So we are not learning the position of I.

But we are testing O, L, V.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters: O, L, V are not forbidden? Yes.

So ""OLIVE"" is a valid word: O-L-I-V-E -> positions: 1:O, 2:L, 3:I, 4:V, 5:E. 
But I is in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we will get '-' for I again? And we know that. So we are not testing a new position for I.

But we are testing O, L, V.

Alternatively, we can try ""OZONE"" -> no I.

""URINE"" invalid.

""EXILE"" invalid.

So ""OLIVE"" is an option, but with I in position 3 (which we know is wrong).

But we are testing O, L, V.

Another word: ""OXIDE"" -> O X I D E -> I in position 3? Same issue.

""OXIDE"" has I in position 3.

""MOVIE"" has I in position 4? Actually, ""MOVIE"" is M-O-V-I-E, so I is in position 4? Yes, position 4: I.

So ""MOVIE"" has I in position 4, which is new.

Similarly, ""BIOME"" has I in position 2? ""BIOME"" is B-I-O-M-E, so I in position 2.

So both are valid.

But ""MOVIE"" uses M, O, V, and I, E. 
""BIOME"" uses B, I, O, M, E.

We already know I and E are in the word, so we are testing the positions of I and E? But we know E is at position 5, so we are confirming that? Actually, we are using E at the end, which we know is correct.

But we are not testing for a second E.

In terms of information, both are similar.

But ""BIOME"" tests B and O, which are more common than M and V? Actually, B is more common than M? B:1.7%, M:2.4%, V:2.1%. So B is more common than V and M? M is more common than V? M:2.4%, V:2.1%, B:1.7%. So M is more common than V and B? Actually, M is more common than V and B? Let me order: 
E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... 
We have eliminated A, T, R, N, S, P. So the next common: O, I (we know), D, L, U, then M, V, B, F, Y, W, G, etc.

So O is very common (7.5%), D is common (4.3%), L is common (4.0%), U (2.8%), etc.

""BIOME"" tests B (1.7%), O (7.5%), M (2.4%), I (7.5%), E (12.7%) -> but we are testing I and E (which we know). So we are testing B, O, M.

""MOVIE"" tests M (2.4%), O (7.5%), V (2.1%), I (7.5%), E (12.7%). So we are testing M, O, V.

Comparing:
- ""BIOME"": tests B, O, M
- ""MOVIE"": tests M, O, V

B is more common than V and M? Actually, M is more common than B? M: 2.4%, B: 1.7%, V: 2.1%. So M is more common than B and V? Yes.

But we are testing three new letters in both.

We can also consider ""MOVIE"" because it tests V which is less common? But we might get information about V.

But I think ""BIOME"" is better because B and O are more common.

But let me check: we know the word has I and E, and we are testing I in position 2 (which might be correct? Or not). If we get feedback that I is in position 2, then we know. If not, then we know I must be in position 1 or 4? But we are testing position 2.

Similarly, in ""MOVIE"", we are testing I in position 4.

But we have to consider that the word might have I in position 1.

Is there a word with I in position 1 and ending with E without forbidden letters?

For example: 
  ""INLET"" -> invalid.
  ""ICED"" -> 4 letters.
  ""IDLER"" -> invalid.
  ""IMPEL"" -> invalid.
  ""IMBUE"" -> invalid.
  ""IMPLY"" -> invalid.
  ""INURE"" -> invalid.
  ""IVIED"" -> invalid.
  ""IXORA"" -> no E.

I think it's hard to find a common word with I at the start and ending with E.

Another: ""INATE"" -> N and A forbidden.

So I think we should go with ""BIOME"" or ""MOVIE"".

But let me see: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both are valid.

I'll choose ""BIOME"" because it tests B and O, which are more common than M and V? Actually, M is more common than B? M: 2.4%, B: 1.7%, V: 2.1%. So M is more common than B and V? Yes.

But ""BIOME"" has I in position 2, which is a position we haven't tested for I.

In ""spite"", we tested I in position 3. Now we are testing I in position 2.

If we get feedback that I is in position 2, then we know. If not, then we know I must be in position 1 or 4? But we are testing position 2.

Also, we are testing O in position 3 and M in position 4.

But we have to be cautious: if the word has I in position 1, then in ""BIOME"", the I in position 2 would be marked as '-'? And we know that? So we are not learning the position.

But we are testing B, O, M.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 1.

For example, ""IMBUE"" doesn't work.

""IMPLY"" doesn't work.

""INFER"" -> N and R forbidden.

""INCLE"" -> N and C forbidden.

""INDEED"" -> 6 letters.

I think it's difficult.

Another word: ""IMPEL"" is invalid.

""IMBUed"" -> not 5 letters.

I think we should go with ""MOVIE"" because it tests V which is less common? But we might get information about V.

But let me see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can use ""DOZEN"" -> but N is forbidden and ends with N? Not E.

""DOZEN"" is D-O-Z-E-N -> ends with N, not E.

So not.

""HOIYE"" -> not a word.

I think ""MOVIE"" is a valid choice.

But let me check if there is a word with I in position 4 and ending with E without forbidden letters.

For example: ""MOVIE"" is one.

""BIOME"" is the other.

But ""BIOME"" has I in position 2, which is more common? Actually, position 2 is more common for I than position 4? Not necessarily.

We can also consider ""OZONE"" -> no I.

""URINE"" invalid.

""EXILE"" invalid.

""AXIOM"" invalid.

""ELIDE"" -> E L I D E -> but we have E at the beginning? And then I in position 3? So I in position 3 again? And we know it's not position 3? So we are testing E at position 1? But we know E is at position 5, so if we put E at position 1, we might get feedback if there is another E? But we don't know.

""ELIDE"" -> E L I D E -> positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E. 
But we know I is not in position 3, so we know that will be '-' again. And we are testing E at position 1. If the secret word has E at position 1, we get a ✓, else if E is only at the end, we get a '-' for position 1 E? But we know there is at least one E (at the end). So if we put E at position 1, and if it's not in the word, we get 'x'. If it is, we get ✓.

But we are not testing the position of I.

And we are using two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's.

But we are testing position 1 for E? And we know position 5 is E, so if we get a '-' for position 1 E, then we know there is only one E (at the end) and it's not at the beginning? But we don't know if there is another E.

It's messy.

So I think it's better to avoid testing E in position 1 until we have more information.

But we are forced to have the word end with E.

Another word: ""BIDET"" -> not a common word? And T is forbidden.

""BIKIE"" -> not standard.

I think we should go with ""BIOME"" or ""MOVIE"".

Let me choose ""MOVIE"" because it tests V, which we haven't tested, and M is also new.

But M is more common than V? Yes.

So I'll go with ""MOVIE"".

But note: we are testing I in position 4. If it turns out that I is in position 2, we won't know until we test position 2.

But we have to start somewhere.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 1 and uses common letters? But we can't find one.

Another idea: ""IMDED"" -> not a word.

I think we have to choose between ""BIOME"" and ""MOVIE"".

I'll choose ""MOVIE"" because it uses V, which is less common, and if it turns out to be present, we get information. And if it's not, we eliminate V.

But let me see the frequency: M is more common than V? Yes.

But we are testing M, O, V.

In ""BIOME"", we test B, O, M.

Both are similar.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have O? We don't know.

I think ""MOVIE"" is a good choice.

But let me check: we know the word has I and E, and we are testing I in position 4. If we get feedback that I is in position 4, then we know. If not, then we know I must be in position 1 or 2? But we are testing position 4.

We can also consider ""OILED"" but it doesn't end with E.

Another word: ""MOLIE"" -> not a word? ""MOLIE"" is not standard.

""MOVIE"" is a standard word.

So I'll go with ""MOVIE"".

But wait, we have to avoid T? Yes, T is forbidden.

So ""MOVIE"" is valid.

Therefore, the third guess: ""MOVIE""

But let me write it: M-O-V-I-E.

So <guess>movie</guess>

But note: we are not sure if the word has M, O, V.

We are testing them.

If we get feedback:
- If M is in the word and in position 1, we get ✓. If not, we get x or -.
- Similarly for O and V.

And for I, we know it's in the word, so we expect at least a '-' for I (unless position 4 is correct, which we don't know).

But we are testing position 4 for I.

So I think it's a good guess.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 1 and uses common letters? But we can't find one.

Another word: ""INLET"" is invalid.

""ICED"" invalid.

I think ""MOVIE"" is acceptable.

But let me see if there is a word with I in position 2 and ending with E without forbidden letters.

For example: ""GUIDE"" -> G U I D E -> I in position 3? No, position 3 is I? Then we know it's not position 3? And we are testing G and U? But we don't know about G and U.

But ""GUIDE"" has I in position 3? Actually, position 2 is U, position 3 is I? Then we have: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E -> I in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we are testing I in position 3 again? We know it's not there, so we will get '-' again? So we are not learning the position.

But we are testing G, U, D.

D is common (4.3%), G is less common (2.2%), U is common (2.8%), D is common (4.3%), G is less common.

So ""GUIDE"" tests G, U, D, but I in position 3 (which we know is wrong).

So we are testing three new letters: G, U, D.

But we are repeating the same position for I.

So I think ""MOVIE"" is better because it tests I in a new position (position 4) and tests M, O, V.

So I'll go with ""MOVIE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **E** is confirmed in position 5 (✓ in both guesses).
- **I** is in the word but not in position 3 (from ""spite"" feedback).
- Forbidden letters (absent from the word): **C, R, A, N, S, P, T** (marked ""x"" in previous feedback).

For the next guess:
- The word must end with **E** (position 5).
- It must include **I** (but not in position 3).
- It should avoid forbidden letters and test new common letters (e.g., **M, O, V**).

I chose **MOVIE** because:
- It ends with **E**.
- It places **I** in position 4 (a new position to test).
- It introduces new common letters: **M, O, V**.
- It avoids all forbidden letters.

<guess>movie</guess>",movie,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

1. ""crane"": 
   C: x (not in the word)
   R: x (not in the word)
   A: x (not in the word)
   N: x (not in the word)
   E: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so the word ends with E)

2. ""spite"":
   S: x (not in the word)
   P: x (not in the word)
   I: - (in the word but wrong position)
   T: x (not in the word)
   E: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so the word ends with E)

From this, we know:
- The word ends with E (position 5 is E).
- The letter I is in the word, but not in position 3 (since in ""spite"", I was in position 3 and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, S, P, T.

We also know that the word contains I (somewhere except position 3) and E (at position 5).

Now, we need to make a third guess. The word structure is: _ _ _ _ E

We know the word has an I, but not in position 3. So I could be in position 1, 2, or 4.

We must avoid the letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, T.

We have 6 tries, so we can try to test more common letters.

We need to choose a word that:
- Ends with E (so position 5 is E)
- Contains I (but not in position 3)
- Avoids C, R, A, N, S, P, T
- Uses new letters to get more information

Common letters we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many of these as possible, especially vowels (O, U, etc.) and common consonants (L, D, M, etc.).

Since we know I is in the word, we can try to place I in a different position (like 1, 2, or 4) and test other common letters.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern: _ _ _ _ E, and include I (but not in position 3), and avoid the forbidden letters.

Possible positions for I:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ E
- Position 2: _ I _ _ E
- Position 4: _ _ _ I E

We also need to test other letters.

Let's try to test O, L, D, M, etc.

Example words:

Option 1: Place I in position 1 and test other letters.
For example: ""IMAGE"" -> but A is forbidden (we know A is not in the word) so invalid.
""INANE"" -> but N and A are forbidden -> invalid.
""IDLER"" -> but R is forbidden -> invalid.

We must avoid A, C, R, N, S, P, T.

So let's try:

- Position 1: I _ _ _ E
  - We need three letters for positions 2,3,4 that are not forbidden and form a valid word.
  - Example: ""ISLE"" -> but S and L? S is forbidden (from ""spite"" feedback: S was x) so we cannot use S.
  - ""IDLER"" is invalid because of R.
  - ""IGLOO"" -> no E at the end? It ends with O, not E. So not.

We need words ending with E. So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E.

With I in position 1: 
  ""INLET"" -> but N and T are forbidden -> invalid.
  ""IMPEL"" -> but P and L? P is forbidden -> invalid.
  ""IDYLL"" -> not ending with E and contains Y, but also not 5 distinct? Actually, ""IDYLL"" ends with L, not E.

It's hard to find a word with I at the start and ending with E without using forbidden letters.

Try I in position 2: 
  _ I _ _ E
  Example: ""TITLE"" -> but T is forbidden -> invalid.
  ""BIBLE"" -> B, I, B, L, E -> but B is repeated? And we don't know if B is in the word. Also, we have two B's? But we can test B and L.
  However, we must avoid forbidden letters: T is forbidden, but B and L are allowed? Yes, because we haven't tested them.

But note: ""BIBLE"" has two B's. We don't know if the secret word has B or not. But it's a valid word.

But we are trying to get information. However, repeating B might not be efficient.

Another: ""DICEY"" -> but C is forbidden and doesn't end with E? It ends with Y.

We need words ending with E.

Another idea: ""QUITE"" -> but Q, U, I, T, E. But T is forbidden (from ""spite"" feedback: T was x) so we cannot use T.

T is forbidden? Yes, from the feedback of ""spite"": T was marked x.

So we cannot use T.

Similarly, S, P are forbidden.

So let's list forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, T.

We can use: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, for I: we know it's in the word, so we must include it.

Let me try to form a word with I and other common letters.

Option: ""OILED"" -> O, I, L, E, D? But wait, the pattern: position 1: O, 2: I, 3: L, 4: E, 5: D? But we need the fifth letter to be E, so that doesn't work.

We need the word to end with E. So the fifth letter is fixed as E.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E

With I in position 2: 
  _ I _ _ E
  Possible words: 
    ""BIBLE"" -> B I B L E -> but two B's and we test B and L.
    ""TITLE"" -> T is forbidden -> invalid.
    ""DICEY"" -> doesn't end with E and has C -> invalid.
    ""LINED"" -> but N is forbidden -> invalid.
    ""MIXED"" -> M I X E D -> but ends with D? No, we need E at the end. ""MIXED"" has E at position 4? Actually, it's M-I-X-E-D, so E is at position 4, D at 5. We need E at 5? So no.

We need the fifth letter to be E. So the word must be: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E.

With I in position 2: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] E.

We can try:
  ""BIKE"" -> too short? 5 letters? No, ""BIKE"" is 4 letters.
  ""BIKER"" -> 5 letters? But ends with R, not E.

Actually, we need 5 letters and ending with E.

Let me think: 
  ""WIPED"" -> W I P E D -> but P is forbidden (from ""spite"") and also ends with D? No, we need E at the end. ""WIPED"" has E at position 4? Actually, W-I-P-E-D: positions: 1:W, 2:I, 3:P, 4:E, 5:D -> so E is at 4, D at 5. Not E at 5.

We need the fifth letter to be E. So the word must be: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E.

So for I in position 2: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] E.

Examples:
  ""QUITE"" -> but T is forbidden -> invalid.
  ""JUICE"" -> J U I C E -> but C is forbidden -> invalid.
  ""GUISE"" -> G U I S E -> but S is forbidden -> invalid.
  ""GUIDE"" -> G U I D E -> but we have E at the end? Yes: G-U-I-D-E -> positions: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E. But wait, we have I in position 3? But in the feedback for ""spite"", I was in position 3 and got a '-' meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong? But we are allowed to guess the same word? We are not forced to avoid repeating a known letter? Actually, we know I is in the word but not in position 3, so if we put I in position 3 again, we know it will be marked as '-' again? But we are trying to get new information. It's better to try I in a new position.

But note: we are allowed to guess the same word? But we know I is in the word, but we don't know its position. So we should try I in a position we haven't tried (i.e., not position 3) to see if it fits.

In ""spite"", I was in position 3. So we can try position 1, 2, or 4.

But in the pattern _ _ _ _ E, if we put I in position 2, then we have: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] E.

We need a valid word that fits: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] E.

Possible words:
  ""BIBLE"" -> B I B L E -> but has two B's. And we don't know about B and L. But we are testing B and L. Also, note that the second letter is I and the last is E.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters: B, L are not forbidden? Yes, because we haven't eliminated them.

But the word ""BIBLE"" has two B's. If the secret word has only one B, then the feedback for the B's might be tricky? But it's allowed.

Alternatively, we can try a word without repeated letters.

What about ""WIDEN""? But ends with N, not E? And N is forbidden.

""GUIDE"": G U I D E -> but in this case, I is in position 3? Actually, position 3 is I? Then we have: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E. But we know I is not in position 3? From the feedback of ""spite"", we know that I is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3 again, we know it will be marked as '-' again? But we are trying to get new information. It's better to try I in a new position.

So we should avoid position 3 for I.

Therefore, for the next guess, we can try I in position 1, 2, or 4.

Let me try to find words with I in position 1, 2, or 4.

With I in position 1: 
  I _ _ _ E
  Examples: 
    ""IMAGE"" -> A forbidden -> no.
    ""INLET"" -> N and T forbidden -> no.
    ""ISLE"" -> S forbidden -> no.
    ""IDLER"" -> R forbidden -> no.
    ""IGLOE"" -> not a word? 
    ""INNED"" -> N forbidden -> no.

It's hard. Let me think of common words.

How about ""IMBUE""? But ends with U, not E.

We need to end with E.

Another: ""INVITE"" -> 6 letters? No.

""ILLUS"" -> not ending with E.

Perhaps ""IMPEL"" -> but P and L? P is forbidden.

I'm struggling. Let me try I in position 4: 
  _ _ _ I E
  Examples:
    ""MOVIE"" -> M O V I E -> but we have E at the end? Yes: M-O-V-I-E -> positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:V, 4:I, 5:E. 
    This word: ""MOVIE"" -> M, O, V, I, E. 
    Avoids forbidden letters? Yes: M, O, V, I, E. 
    But we have I in position 4? That's a new position.

Also, we test M, O, V, and we already know I and E.

But note: we are testing O and V? And M.

This seems good.

Another possibility: ""DIVIE"" -> not a word? 
""QUITE"" is invalid because of T.

""MOVIE"" is a valid word.

We can also consider ""OZONE"" -> but doesn't have I and ends with E? O-Z-O-N-E -> no I, and N is forbidden.

We must include I because we know it's in the word.

So ""MOVIE"" is a candidate.

With I in position 2: 
  _ I _ _ E
  ""GUIDE"" -> G U I D E -> but I is in position 3? Actually, position 3 is I? Then we have: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E -> so I is in position 3. But we know I is not in position 3? So we shouldn't put I in position 3 again? Actually, we can, but we know it will be marked as '-' again? So it's a waste of a position? We want to test new positions.

But we are forced to have the fifth letter E. So we can try I in position 2.

Word: ""DICEY"" -> doesn't end with E.

""LIGHT"" -> no E.

""BIKIE"" -> not standard.

""MIKVE"" -> not a word.

Perhaps ""LIVED"" -> L I V E D -> but ends with D? Not E.

It's difficult to find a word with I in position 2 and ending with E.

What about ""WIPED"" -> W I P E D -> ends with D? No.

""MINCE"" -> M I N C E -> but N and C are forbidden -> invalid.

""WINCE"" -> W I N C E -> forbidden letters.

So maybe position 2 is hard.

Position 1: 
  I _ _ _ E
  ""ITCHY"" -> ends with Y? Not E.
  ""IMPLY"" -> ends with Y? Not E.
  ""INBOX"" -> no E.

How about ""INURE"" -> but R and N forbidden -> invalid.

I think position 1 is not easy.

Position 4:
  _ _ _ I E
  ""MOVIE"" -> M O V I E -> as above.

Another: ""HAPPY"" -> no E and forbidden A.

""JUMBO"" -> no E.

""LUCRE"" -> R forbidden -> no.

""MOVIE"" seems good.

But note: we are testing O, V, M. 

We could also try ""DIVIE"" -> not a word.

""QUINE"" -> Q U I N E -> but N is forbidden -> invalid.

""QUITE"" -> T forbidden -> invalid.

So ""MOVIE"" is a valid option.

But let me check: ""MOVIE"" -> M O V I E. 
- Position 1: M
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: V
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: E (fixed)

We know I is in the word, and we are putting it in position 4. If the secret word has I in position 4, we get a ✓ for I? Or if not, we get a '-' or 'x'. But we know I is in the word, so it won't be 'x'. It could be '-' if it's in the word but not in position 4, or ✓ if it is in position 4.

Also, we test M, O, V.

Another candidate: ""OILED"" -> O I L E D -> but ends with D? Not E.

""TIMED"" -> T forbidden -> no.

""VIMEN"" -> not a word.

""MOVIE"" seems a good choice.

But note: we are not sure if O, V, M are in the word. We are testing them.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 1 or 2 and uses more common letters.

What about ""LIVE?"" -> 4 letters.

""IVEY"" -> 4 letters.

""OBIED"" -> not a word.

I think ""MOVIE"" is acceptable.

But let me see if there is a word with I in position 1 and ending with E without forbidden letters.

For example: ""INLET"" is invalid.

""ICED"" -> 4 letters.

""IDLER"" is invalid.

""IMPEL"" invalid.

""IMBUE"" -> ends with U.

""IMPLY"" -> ends with Y.

""INURE"" invalid.

""IVIED"" -> not a word? ""IVIED"" is not standard.

""OILER"" -> but ends with R? Not E, and R is forbidden.

""OILIE"" -> not a word.

So ""MOVIE"" might be one of the few options.

Another word: ""DIVIE"" -> not a word.

""JIVED"" -> J I V E D -> ends with D? Not E.

""JIGED"" -> not a word.

""KITED"" -> not a word.

""LIVED"" -> not a word.

""WIVED"" -> not a word.

So ""MOVIE"" is a valid word.

But note: we are testing V and O? And M.

Alternatively, we can try ""MOIRE"" -> M O I R E -> but R is forbidden -> invalid.

""NOISE"" -> N and S forbidden -> no.

""VOICE"" -> V O I C E -> C is forbidden -> invalid.

So I think ""MOVIE"" is a reasonable guess.

But wait, we have to consider that the word might have I in position 4? Or position 2? We are testing position 4.

If we get feedback that I is in the word but not in position 4, then we know it must be in position 1 or 2? But we are testing position 4.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 1 or 2.

But we couldn't find a common word with I in position 1 and ending with E without forbidden letters.

What about ""DWINE"" -> not a word.

""EXILE"" -> E X I L E -> but we have E at the beginning? And then I in position 3? But we are avoiding position 3 for I? Actually, we are forced to have I somewhere. But in ""EXILE"", I is in position 3? Then we know that position 3 is not I? But we are trying to test a new position? Actually, we are repeating position 3? We know I is not in position 3, so if we put I in position 3 again, we know it will be marked as '-' again? So it's inefficient.

But we are allowed to do that? But we are not learning new information about I's position.

We want to know where I is. So we should try it in a new position.

Therefore, ""MOVIE"" has I in position 4, which is new.

Another word: ""GIVEN"" -> G I V E N -> but N is forbidden -> invalid.

""LIKEN"" -> L I K E N -> N forbidden -> invalid.

""MIXED"" -> M I X E D -> ends with D? No.

""WIFED"" -> not a word.

So ""MOVIE"" is one of the few.

But note: there is ""BICEP"" -> but C and P forbidden -> no.

""FIELD"" -> ends with D.

""VIELD"" -> ends with D.

""HELIX"" -> ends with X.

""HELLO"" -> ends with O.

I think ""MOVIE"" is acceptable.

But let me check if there is a word with I in position 2.

For example: ""TITLE"" -> T forbidden.

""BIOME"" -> B I O M E -> ends with E? Yes: B-I-O-M-E -> positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:O, 4:M, 5:E. 
This word: ""BIOME"" -> B, I, O, M, E.
- Avoids forbidden letters? Yes: B, I, O, M, E. 
- I is in position 2, which is new.

And we test B, O, M.

This is also a valid word.

So we have two candidates: ""MOVIE"" (I in position 4) and ""BIOME"" (I in position 2).

Which one is better? Both test 4 new letters.

But we have to consider letter frequency.

Common letters: L, O, D, M, B, etc.

""BIOME"" tests B, O, M, and I (which we know) and E (known). 
""MOVIE"" tests M, O, V, and I, E.

V is less common than B? So ""BIOME"" might be better because B and O are more common.

But we don't know.

Another word: ""OZONE"" -> no I.

""URINE"" -> U R I N E -> R and N forbidden -> invalid.

""HELIX"" -> ends with X.

""HELLO"" -> ends with O.

""JUMBO"" -> no E.

I think both ""BIOME"" and ""MOVIE"" are acceptable.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both avoid them.

Let me choose ""BIOME"" because it tests B and O, which are common.

But we have to consider that the word might have O? We don't know.

Alternatively, we can try ""OILED"" but it doesn't end with E? It ends with D.

""OILED"" is O-I-L-E-D -> ends with D.

So not.

Another word: ""OXIDE"" -> O X I D E -> but we have I in position 3? Then we know position 3 is not I? And we are testing O and X? But X is rare.

But ""OXIDE"" is a word: O-X-I-D-E -> positions: 1:O, 2:X, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E. But we know I is not in position 3, so we know that will be '-' again. So we are testing O, X, D.

But X is rare, so maybe not.

""MOVIE"" is more common.

But let me see: we have to include I and E (at the end). So we are including I and E, and testing three new letters.

We can also consider ""DIVIE"" -> not a word.

""VIXEN"" -> V I X E N -> but N is forbidden -> invalid.

""VIMEN"" -> not a word.

So between ""BIOME"" and ""MOVIE"", I think ""MOVIE"" is more common and uses more common letters? M, O, V, I, E.

But V is less common. B is more common than V? In English, B is more common than V.

Letter frequency: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... then C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, ...

So M is more common than V, and B is more common than M? Actually, B is more common than M and V? Let me recall: 
Common letters: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... 
We have eliminated A, T, R, N, S, P. So the next common are: O, I, D, L, U, then M, F, Y, W, G, B, V, K.

So B is more common than V and M? Actually, B is about 1.7%, M is 2.4%, V is 2.1%. So B is more common than M and V.

But we are testing 4 letters: two of which are I and E, and two more.

In ""BIOME"": tests B, I, O, M, E -> B:1.7%, O:7.5%, M:2.4%, I:7.5%, E:12.7% (but we already know E is in, so we are testing the position of E? But we know E is at the end, so we are confirming that? Actually, we already know E is at the end, so we don't need to test E again? But we are using it to complete the word.

But we are allowed to reuse a known letter? Yes, but we know E is in the word and at the end, so we should keep it? Actually, we can change the position of E? But we know E is at the end, so we should keep it at the end? Not necessarily. We can test if there is another E? But we don't have any indication of another E. But we can use a word that has E in a different position? But we know the word has at least one E (at the end). If we put E in position 4, for example, we might get feedback if there is another E.

But in ""MOVIE"", we have E only at the end? So we are testing the E at the end, which we know is correct. We are not testing for another E.

In ""BIOME"", we have E at the end and also at position 4? No, ""BIOME"" has E at the end and no other E? Actually, ""BIOME"" has only one E? But we don't know if there is another E. The word ""BIOME"" has E at the end, and the middle has O, M, B. No other E.

""MOVIE"" has E only at the end? Actually, ""MOVIE"" is M-O-V-I-E, so only one E (at the end). But we are testing position 4 for I.

But we are not testing for another E.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has E in position 4? But we don't know if there is an E in position 4.

For example, ""OPINE"" -> O P I N E -> but P and N are forbidden -> invalid.

""URINE"" -> forbidden letters.

""EXILE"" -> forbidden letters.

""AXIOM"" -> no E and A forbidden.

I think ""MOVIE"" is fine.

But let me see if there is a word with I in position 1 and ending with E without forbidden letters.

For example: ""INLET"" invalid.

""ICED"" invalid.

""IDLER"" invalid.

""IMBUE"" -> ends with U.

""IMPLY"" -> ends with Y.

""INURE"" invalid.

""IVIED"" -> not a word.

""OBIED"" -> not a word.

""OGEED"" -> not a word.

""OILED"" -> ends with D.

""OMINE"" -> not a word.

""OLIVE"" -> O L I V E -> but I is in position 3? Then we know position 3 is not I? And we are testing O and L and V. But I is in position 3 again? So we get feedback on I: it will be '-' again? And we know that. So we are not learning the position of I.

But we are testing O, L, V.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters: O, L, V are not forbidden? Yes.

So ""OLIVE"" is a valid word: O-L-I-V-E -> positions: 1:O, 2:L, 3:I, 4:V, 5:E. 
But I is in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we will get '-' for I again? And we know that. So we are not testing a new position for I.

But we are testing O, L, V.

Alternatively, we can try ""OZONE"" -> no I.

""URINE"" invalid.

""EXILE"" invalid.

So ""OLIVE"" is an option, but with I in position 3 (which we know is wrong).

But we are testing O, L, V.

Another word: ""OXIDE"" -> O X I D E -> I in position 3? Same issue.

""OXIDE"" has I in position 3.

""MOVIE"" has I in position 4? Actually, ""MOVIE"" is M-O-V-I-E, so I is in position 4? Yes, position 4: I.

So ""MOVIE"" has I in position 4, which is new.

Similarly, ""BIOME"" has I in position 2? ""BIOME"" is B-I-O-M-E, so I in position 2.

So both are valid.

But ""MOVIE"" uses M, O, V, and I, E. 
""BIOME"" uses B, I, O, M, E.

We already know I and E are in the word, so we are testing the positions of I and E? But we know E is at position 5, so we are confirming that? Actually, we are using E at the end, which we know is correct.

But we are not testing for a second E.

In terms of information, both are similar.

But ""BIOME"" tests B and O, which are more common than M and V? Actually, B is more common than M? B:1.7%, M:2.4%, V:2.1%. So B is more common than V and M? M is more common than V? M:2.4%, V:2.1%, B:1.7%. So M is more common than V and B? Actually, M is more common than V and B? Let me order: 
E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... 
We have eliminated A, T, R, N, S, P. So the next common: O, I (we know), D, L, U, then M, V, B, F, Y, W, G, etc.

So O is very common (7.5%), D is common (4.3%), L is common (4.0%), U (2.8%), etc.

""BIOME"" tests B (1.7%), O (7.5%), M (2.4%), I (7.5%), E (12.7%) -> but we are testing I and E (which we know). So we are testing B, O, M.

""MOVIE"" tests M (2.4%), O (7.5%), V (2.1%), I (7.5%), E (12.7%). So we are testing M, O, V.

Comparing:
- ""BIOME"": tests B, O, M
- ""MOVIE"": tests M, O, V

B is more common than V and M? Actually, M is more common than B? M: 2.4%, B: 1.7%, V: 2.1%. So M is more common than B and V? Yes.

But we are testing three new letters in both.

We can also consider ""MOVIE"" because it tests V which is less common? But we might get information about V.

But I think ""BIOME"" is better because B and O are more common.

But let me check: we know the word has I and E, and we are testing I in position 2 (which might be correct? Or not). If we get feedback that I is in position 2, then we know. If not, then we know I must be in position 1 or 4? But we are testing position 2.

Similarly, in ""MOVIE"", we are testing I in position 4.

But we have to consider that the word might have I in position 1.

Is there a word with I in position 1 and ending with E without forbidden letters?

For example: 
  ""INLET"" -> invalid.
  ""ICED"" -> 4 letters.
  ""IDLER"" -> invalid.
  ""IMPEL"" -> invalid.
  ""IMBUE"" -> invalid.
  ""IMPLY"" -> invalid.
  ""INURE"" -> invalid.
  ""IVIED"" -> invalid.
  ""IXORA"" -> no E.

I think it's hard to find a common word with I at the start and ending with E.

Another: ""INATE"" -> N and A forbidden.

So I think we should go with ""BIOME"" or ""MOVIE"".

But let me see: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both are valid.

I'll choose ""BIOME"" because it tests B and O, which are more common than M and V? Actually, M is more common than B? M: 2.4%, B: 1.7%, V: 2.1%. So M is more common than B and V? Yes.

But ""BIOME"" has I in position 2, which is a position we haven't tested for I.

In ""spite"", we tested I in position 3. Now we are testing I in position 2.

If we get feedback that I is in position 2, then we know. If not, then we know I must be in position 1 or 4? But we are testing position 2.

Also, we are testing O in position 3 and M in position 4.

But we have to be cautious: if the word has I in position 1, then in ""BIOME"", the I in position 2 would be marked as '-'? And we know that? So we are not learning the position.

But we are testing B, O, M.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 1.

For example, ""IMBUE"" doesn't work.

""IMPLY"" doesn't work.

""INFER"" -> N and R forbidden.

""INCLE"" -> N and C forbidden.

""INDEED"" -> 6 letters.

I think it's difficult.

Another word: ""IMPEL"" is invalid.

""IMBUed"" -> not 5 letters.

I think we should go with ""MOVIE"" because it tests V which is less common? But we might get information about V.

But let me see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can use ""DOZEN"" -> but N is forbidden and ends with N? Not E.

""DOZEN"" is D-O-Z-E-N -> ends with N, not E.

So not.

""HOIYE"" -> not a word.

I think ""MOVIE"" is a valid choice.

But let me check if there is a word with I in position 4 and ending with E without forbidden letters.

For example: ""MOVIE"" is one.

""BIOME"" is the other.

But ""BIOME"" has I in position 2, which is more common? Actually, position 2 is more common for I than position 4? Not necessarily.

We can also consider ""OZONE"" -> no I.

""URINE"" invalid.

""EXILE"" invalid.

""AXIOM"" invalid.

""ELIDE"" -> E L I D E -> but we have E at the beginning? And then I in position 3? So I in position 3 again? And we know it's not position 3? So we are testing E at position 1? But we know E is at position 5, so if we put E at position 1, we might get feedback if there is another E? But we don't know.

""ELIDE"" -> E L I D E -> positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E. 
But we know I is not in position 3, so we know that will be '-' again. And we are testing E at position 1. If the secret word has E at position 1, we get a ✓, else if E is only at the end, we get a '-' for position 1 E? But we know there is at least one E (at the end). So if we put E at position 1, and if it's not in the word, we get 'x'. If it is, we get ✓.

But we are not testing the position of I.

And we are using two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's.

But we are testing position 1 for E? And we know position 5 is E, so if we get a '-' for position 1 E, then we know there is only one E (at the end) and it's not at the beginning? But we don't know if there is another E.

It's messy.

So I think it's better to avoid testing E in position 1 until we have more information.

But we are forced to have the word end with E.

Another word: ""BIDET"" -> not a common word? And T is forbidden.

""BIKIE"" -> not standard.

I think we should go with ""BIOME"" or ""MOVIE"".

Let me choose ""MOVIE"" because it tests V, which we haven't tested, and M is also new.

But M is more common than V? Yes.

So I'll go with ""MOVIE"".

But note: we are testing I in position 4. If it turns out that I is in position 2, we won't know until we test position 2.

But we have to start somewhere.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 1 and uses common letters? But we can't find one.

Another idea: ""IMDED"" -> not a word.

I think we have to choose between ""BIOME"" and ""MOVIE"".

I'll choose ""MOVIE"" because it uses V, which is less common, and if it turns out to be present, we get information. And if it's not, we eliminate V.

But let me see the frequency: M is more common than V? Yes.

But we are testing M, O, V.

In ""BIOME"", we test B, O, M.

Both are similar.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have O? We don't know.

I think ""MOVIE"" is a good choice.

But let me check: we know the word has I and E, and we are testing I in position 4. If we get feedback that I is in position 4, then we know. If not, then we know I must be in position 1 or 2? But we are testing position 4.

We can also consider ""OILED"" but it doesn't end with E.

Another word: ""MOLIE"" -> not a word? ""MOLIE"" is not standard.

""MOVIE"" is a standard word.

So I'll go with ""MOVIE"".

But wait, we have to avoid T? Yes, T is forbidden.

So ""MOVIE"" is valid.

Therefore, the third guess: ""MOVIE""

But let me write it: M-O-V-I-E.

So <guess>movie</guess>

But note: we are not sure if the word has M, O, V.

We are testing them.

If we get feedback:
- If M is in the word and in position 1, we get ✓. If not, we get x or -.
- Similarly for O and V.

And for I, we know it's in the word, so we expect at least a '-' for I (unless position 4 is correct, which we don't know).

But we are testing position 4 for I.

So I think it's a good guess.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 1 and uses common letters? But we can't find one.

Another word: ""INLET"" is invalid.

""ICED"" invalid.

I think ""MOVIE"" is acceptable.

But let me see if there is a word with I in position 2 and ending with E without forbidden letters.

For example: ""GUIDE"" -> G U I D E -> I in position 3? No, position 3 is I? Then we know it's not position 3? And we are testing G and U? But we don't know about G and U.

But ""GUIDE"" has I in position 3? Actually, position 2 is U, position 3 is I? Then we have: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E -> I in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we are testing I in position 3 again? We know it's not there, so we will get '-' again? So we are not learning the position.

But we are testing G, U, D.

D is common (4.3%), G is less common (2.2%), U is common (2.8%), D is common (4.3%), G is less common.

So ""GUIDE"" tests G, U, D, but I in position 3 (which we know is wrong).

So we are testing three new letters: G, U, D.

But we are repeating the same position for I.

So I think ""MOVIE"" is better because it tests I in a new position (position 4) and tests M, O, V.

So I'll go with ""MOVIE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **E** is confirmed in position 5 (✓ in both guesses).
- **I** is in the word but not in position 3 (from ""spite"" feedback).
- Forbidden letters (absent from the word): **C, R, A, N, S, P, T** (marked ""x"" in previous feedback).

For the next guess:
- The word must end with **E** (position 5).
- It must include **I** (but not in position 3).
- It should avoid forbidden letters and test new common letters (e.g., **M, O, V**).

I chose **MOVIE** because:
- It ends with **E**.
- It places **I** in position 4 (a new position to test).
- It introduces new common letters: **M, O, V**.
- It avoids all forbidden letters.",Guess 3: movie -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) V(x) I(✓) E(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

 This tells us:
 - The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5). So the secret word ends with E.
 - The letters C, R, A, N are not in the word at all.

 Since we know the word ends with E, and we have 4 letters that are not in the word, we can try to think of a new word that:
 - Ends with E (so the fifth letter is E)
 - Does not contain C, R, A, N.

 We also want to use common letters to get more information.

 Let's consider common consonants that are not C, R, A, N. Some common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, M, P, etc.

 We can try a word that has a mix of these common letters and ends with E.

 Example words: 
   ""SLATE"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word) and T is common.
   ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> but we don't know about these.

 However, note that we must avoid A, C, R, N.

 Let's think of words ending with E that do not contain A, C, R, N.

 Some possibilities:
   ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E
   ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E
   ""STYLE"" -> S, T, Y, L, E
   ""SMITE"" -> S, M, I, T, E

 We also want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Since we have only one letter fixed (E at the end), we can try to test multiple common letters.

 Let's choose ""STOLE"" because it has S, T, O, L which are common and we avoid the forbidden letters.

 But note: we are not sure if any of these are in the word. We are trying to get more information.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has a double E? But we don't know if there is another E.

 However, the feedback for the first word didn't show any other E (but we only had one E at the end). So it's possible there is another E? 
 But note: the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. Since we only had one E, we don't know about other positions.

 But we must avoid using the same letter twice unless we suspect it? Since we don't have any indication of a double E, we can use distinct letters.

 Let's go with ""STOLE"".

 However, note that the word must be a valid 5-letter word.

 But wait: we know that the word has an E at the end, and we are avoiding A, C, R, N. So ""STOLE"" is a valid guess.

 Alternatively, we could use ""SPITE"", but that has only 4 distinct letters? Actually, ""SPITE"" has S, P, I, T, E -> all distinct.

 But let me check: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels? We know that A is not in the word, so the vowels in the word might be E (at the end) and possibly O, I, U? 

 We haven't tested O, I, U. So including a word that has O, I, U would be good.

 However, we also want to test common consonants. Let's compare:

 Option 1: ""STOLE"" -> tests S, T, O, L (and we already know E is at the end)
 Option 2: ""SPITE"" -> tests S, P, I, T (and E at the end)

 Both are good. But note that we have already eliminated A, so we are safe.

 I think ""SPITE"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (O and I) and three consonants (S, P, T) that we haven't tested.

 But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are not present: C, R, A, N. Both words avoid these.

 Let me choose ""SPITE"". However, note that the feedback for the first word didn't have any yellow (wrong position) for the other letters? But we don't have any other information.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has the E at the end and uses new letters.

 I'll go with ""SPITE"".

 But note: the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""SPITE"" is a valid word.

 So the next guess: ""SPITE""

 However, let me double-check: we know the word has an E at the end, and we are avoiding A, C, R, N. So ""SPITE"" is acceptable.

 Alternatively, we could use ""SLIME"", but that has M and I, and L. But note: we don't know about L, M, I, S.

 But we are trying to cover more common letters. The letters in ""SPITE"" are S, P, I, T, E. 

 Another option: ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E. But Q is less common and we might not want to use it.

 Since we are in the second guess, we can try to get as much information as possible.

 But note: we have only one letter fixed (E at the end). So we are trying to figure out the first four letters.

 We can also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any evidence of that.

 Let me choose ""SPITE"".

 However, note that the word ""SPITE"" might not be the only possibility. But we are trying to get feedback.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has more vowels? We know that A is out, so the vowels are likely E (at the end) and possibly O, I, U. So including O and I might be good.

 But ""SPITE"" only has I. 

 Another word: ""SOOTE"" -> but that's not a common word? Actually, ""SOOTE"" is not valid.

 How about ""SLICE""? But we know C is not in the word (from the first feedback: C was x) so we cannot use C.

 We must avoid C, R, A, N.

 So let me think of words ending in E that do not contain C, R, A, N and use common letters.

 I'll go with ""SPITE"" because it uses S, P, I, T which are common.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has S, P, I, T. We are testing them.

 Alternatively, we could use ""STOLE"" (S, T, O, L) but we are avoiding O? Actually, we haven't tested O and we know the word must have vowels. Since A is out, the vowels are likely E, O, I, U. So testing O and I might be good.

 But ""STOLE"" tests O and L, while ""SPITE"" tests I and T.

 Since T is more common than L, maybe ""SPITE"" is better.

 However, we have to consider that the word might have two E's? But we don't have any indication of that.

 After thinking, I'll go with ""SPITE"".

 But wait: what if the word is ""QUITE""? We wouldn't know. But we are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has O and I? But we have to avoid the forbidden letters.

 I think ""SPITE"" is a reasonable guess.

 However, note that the word ""SPITE"" might be the actual word? But we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can use ""SLIME"" to test S, L, I, M. But M is less common than T? 

 Let me check the frequency of letters. In English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know A and N are out. So T, O, I, S, L are good.

 We can try to cover T, O, I, S, L? But we have only 4 positions (since the last is E). So we can test 4 new letters.

 But note: we are constrained by the word having 5 letters and ending with E.

 I think ""SPITE"" is a good choice because it tests S, P, I, T.

 So I'll go with ""SPITE"".

 But wait: what if the word has a double letter? We don't know. But we are not using double letters in this guess.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""SPITE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **E** is correct and in position 5 (so the secret word ends with **E**).
- **C, R, A, N** are absent from the word entirely.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with **E**.
- It should avoid **C, R, A, N**.
- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **S, T, O, I, P**) to maximize information.

I chose **SPITE** because:
- It ends with **E**.
- It avoids forbidden letters.
- It tests 4 new high-frequency consonants/vowels (**S, P, I, T**).
- It is a valid 5-letter word.

<guess>spite</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: spite -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(-) T(x) E(✓)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for two guesses:

1. ""crane"": 
   C: x (not in the word)
   R: x (not in the word)
   A: x (not in the word)
   N: x (not in the word)
   E: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so the word ends with E)

2. ""spite"":
   S: x (not in the word)
   P: x (not in the word)
   I: - (in the word but wrong position)
   T: x (not in the word)
   E: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so the word ends with E)

From this, we know:
- The word ends with E (position 5 is E).
- The letter I is in the word, but not in position 3 (since in ""spite"", I was in position 3 and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, S, P, T.

We also know that the word contains I (somewhere except position 3) and E (at position 5).

Now, we need to make a third guess. The word structure is: _ _ _ _ E

We know the word has an I, but not in position 3. So I could be in position 1, 2, or 4.

We must avoid the letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, T.

We have 6 tries, so we can try to test more common letters.

We need to choose a word that:
- Ends with E (so position 5 is E)
- Contains I (but not in position 3)
- Avoids C, R, A, N, S, P, T
- Uses new letters to get more information

Common letters we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test as many of these as possible, especially vowels (O, U, etc.) and common consonants (L, D, M, etc.).

Since we know I is in the word, we can try to place I in a different position (like 1, 2, or 4) and test other common letters.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern: _ _ _ _ E, and include I (but not in position 3), and avoid the forbidden letters.

Possible positions for I:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ E
- Position 2: _ I _ _ E
- Position 4: _ _ _ I E

We also need to test other letters.

Let's try to test O, L, D, M, etc.

Example words:

Option 1: Place I in position 1 and test other letters.
For example: ""IMAGE"" -> but A is forbidden (we know A is not in the word) so invalid.
""INANE"" -> but N and A are forbidden -> invalid.
""IDLER"" -> but R is forbidden -> invalid.

We must avoid A, C, R, N, S, P, T.

So let's try:

- Position 1: I _ _ _ E
  - We need three letters for positions 2,3,4 that are not forbidden and form a valid word.
  - Example: ""ISLE"" -> but S and L? S is forbidden (from ""spite"" feedback: S was x) so we cannot use S.
  - ""IDLER"" is invalid because of R.
  - ""IGLOO"" -> no E at the end? It ends with O, not E. So not.

We need words ending with E. So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E.

With I in position 1: 
  ""INLET"" -> but N and T are forbidden -> invalid.
  ""IMPEL"" -> but P and L? P is forbidden -> invalid.
  ""IDYLL"" -> not ending with E and contains Y, but also not 5 distinct? Actually, ""IDYLL"" ends with L, not E.

It's hard to find a word with I at the start and ending with E without using forbidden letters.

Try I in position 2: 
  _ I _ _ E
  Example: ""TITLE"" -> but T is forbidden -> invalid.
  ""BIBLE"" -> B, I, B, L, E -> but B is repeated? And we don't know if B is in the word. Also, we have two B's? But we can test B and L.
  However, we must avoid forbidden letters: T is forbidden, but B and L are allowed? Yes, because we haven't tested them.

But note: ""BIBLE"" has two B's. We don't know if the secret word has B or not. But it's a valid word.

But we are trying to get information. However, repeating B might not be efficient.

Another: ""DICEY"" -> but C is forbidden and doesn't end with E? It ends with Y.

We need words ending with E.

Another idea: ""QUITE"" -> but Q, U, I, T, E. But T is forbidden (from ""spite"" feedback: T was x) so we cannot use T.

T is forbidden? Yes, from the feedback of ""spite"": T was marked x.

So we cannot use T.

Similarly, S, P are forbidden.

So let's list forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, T.

We can use: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, for I: we know it's in the word, so we must include it.

Let me try to form a word with I and other common letters.

Option: ""OILED"" -> O, I, L, E, D? But wait, the pattern: position 1: O, 2: I, 3: L, 4: E, 5: D? But we need the fifth letter to be E, so that doesn't work.

We need the word to end with E. So the fifth letter is fixed as E.

So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E

With I in position 2: 
  _ I _ _ E
  Possible words: 
    ""BIBLE"" -> B I B L E -> but two B's and we test B and L.
    ""TITLE"" -> T is forbidden -> invalid.
    ""DICEY"" -> doesn't end with E and has C -> invalid.
    ""LINED"" -> but N is forbidden -> invalid.
    ""MIXED"" -> M I X E D -> but ends with D? No, we need E at the end. ""MIXED"" has E at position 4? Actually, it's M-I-X-E-D, so E is at position 4, D at 5. We need E at 5? So no.

We need the fifth letter to be E. So the word must be: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E.

With I in position 2: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] E.

We can try:
  ""BIKE"" -> too short? 5 letters? No, ""BIKE"" is 4 letters.
  ""BIKER"" -> 5 letters? But ends with R, not E.

Actually, we need 5 letters and ending with E.

Let me think: 
  ""WIPED"" -> W I P E D -> but P is forbidden (from ""spite"") and also ends with D? No, we need E at the end. ""WIPED"" has E at position 4? Actually, W-I-P-E-D: positions: 1:W, 2:I, 3:P, 4:E, 5:D -> so E is at 4, D at 5. Not E at 5.

We need the fifth letter to be E. So the word must be: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E.

So for I in position 2: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] E.

Examples:
  ""QUITE"" -> but T is forbidden -> invalid.
  ""JUICE"" -> J U I C E -> but C is forbidden -> invalid.
  ""GUISE"" -> G U I S E -> but S is forbidden -> invalid.
  ""GUIDE"" -> G U I D E -> but we have E at the end? Yes: G-U-I-D-E -> positions: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E. But wait, we have I in position 3? But in the feedback for ""spite"", I was in position 3 and got a '-' meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong? But we are allowed to guess the same word? We are not forced to avoid repeating a known letter? Actually, we know I is in the word but not in position 3, so if we put I in position 3 again, we know it will be marked as '-' again? But we are trying to get new information. It's better to try I in a new position.

But note: we are allowed to guess the same word? But we know I is in the word, but we don't know its position. So we should try I in a position we haven't tried (i.e., not position 3) to see if it fits.

In ""spite"", I was in position 3. So we can try position 1, 2, or 4.

But in the pattern _ _ _ _ E, if we put I in position 2, then we have: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] E.

We need a valid word that fits: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] E.

Possible words:
  ""BIBLE"" -> B I B L E -> but has two B's. And we don't know about B and L. But we are testing B and L. Also, note that the second letter is I and the last is E.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters: B, L are not forbidden? Yes, because we haven't eliminated them.

But the word ""BIBLE"" has two B's. If the secret word has only one B, then the feedback for the B's might be tricky? But it's allowed.

Alternatively, we can try a word without repeated letters.

What about ""WIDEN""? But ends with N, not E? And N is forbidden.

""GUIDE"": G U I D E -> but in this case, I is in position 3? Actually, position 3 is I? Then we have: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E. But we know I is not in position 3? From the feedback of ""spite"", we know that I is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3 again, we know it will be marked as '-' again? But we are trying to get new information. It's better to try I in a new position.

So we should avoid position 3 for I.

Therefore, for the next guess, we can try I in position 1, 2, or 4.

Let me try to find words with I in position 1, 2, or 4.

With I in position 1: 
  I _ _ _ E
  Examples: 
    ""IMAGE"" -> A forbidden -> no.
    ""INLET"" -> N and T forbidden -> no.
    ""ISLE"" -> S forbidden -> no.
    ""IDLER"" -> R forbidden -> no.
    ""IGLOE"" -> not a word? 
    ""INNED"" -> N forbidden -> no.

It's hard. Let me think of common words.

How about ""IMBUE""? But ends with U, not E.

We need to end with E.

Another: ""INVITE"" -> 6 letters? No.

""ILLUS"" -> not ending with E.

Perhaps ""IMPEL"" -> but P and L? P is forbidden.

I'm struggling. Let me try I in position 4: 
  _ _ _ I E
  Examples:
    ""MOVIE"" -> M O V I E -> but we have E at the end? Yes: M-O-V-I-E -> positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:V, 4:I, 5:E. 
    This word: ""MOVIE"" -> M, O, V, I, E. 
    Avoids forbidden letters? Yes: M, O, V, I, E. 
    But we have I in position 4? That's a new position.

Also, we test M, O, V, and we already know I and E.

But note: we are testing O and V? And M.

This seems good.

Another possibility: ""DIVIE"" -> not a word? 
""QUITE"" is invalid because of T.

""MOVIE"" is a valid word.

We can also consider ""OZONE"" -> but doesn't have I and ends with E? O-Z-O-N-E -> no I, and N is forbidden.

We must include I because we know it's in the word.

So ""MOVIE"" is a candidate.

With I in position 2: 
  _ I _ _ E
  ""GUIDE"" -> G U I D E -> but I is in position 3? Actually, position 3 is I? Then we have: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E -> so I is in position 3. But we know I is not in position 3? So we shouldn't put I in position 3 again? Actually, we can, but we know it will be marked as '-' again? So it's a waste of a position? We want to test new positions.

But we are forced to have the fifth letter E. So we can try I in position 2.

Word: ""DICEY"" -> doesn't end with E.

""LIGHT"" -> no E.

""BIKIE"" -> not standard.

""MIKVE"" -> not a word.

Perhaps ""LIVED"" -> L I V E D -> but ends with D? Not E.

It's difficult to find a word with I in position 2 and ending with E.

What about ""WIPED"" -> W I P E D -> ends with D? No.

""MINCE"" -> M I N C E -> but N and C are forbidden -> invalid.

""WINCE"" -> W I N C E -> forbidden letters.

So maybe position 2 is hard.

Position 1: 
  I _ _ _ E
  ""ITCHY"" -> ends with Y? Not E.
  ""IMPLY"" -> ends with Y? Not E.
  ""INBOX"" -> no E.

How about ""INURE"" -> but R and N forbidden -> invalid.

I think position 1 is not easy.

Position 4:
  _ _ _ I E
  ""MOVIE"" -> M O V I E -> as above.

Another: ""HAPPY"" -> no E and forbidden A.

""JUMBO"" -> no E.

""LUCRE"" -> R forbidden -> no.

""MOVIE"" seems good.

But note: we are testing O, V, M. 

We could also try ""DIVIE"" -> not a word.

""QUINE"" -> Q U I N E -> but N is forbidden -> invalid.

""QUITE"" -> T forbidden -> invalid.

So ""MOVIE"" is a valid option.

But let me check: ""MOVIE"" -> M O V I E. 
- Position 1: M
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: V
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: E (fixed)

We know I is in the word, and we are putting it in position 4. If the secret word has I in position 4, we get a ✓ for I? Or if not, we get a '-' or 'x'. But we know I is in the word, so it won't be 'x'. It could be '-' if it's in the word but not in position 4, or ✓ if it is in position 4.

Also, we test M, O, V.

Another candidate: ""OILED"" -> O I L E D -> but ends with D? Not E.

""TIMED"" -> T forbidden -> no.

""VIMEN"" -> not a word.

""MOVIE"" seems a good choice.

But note: we are not sure if O, V, M are in the word. We are testing them.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 1 or 2 and uses more common letters.

What about ""LIVE?"" -> 4 letters.

""IVEY"" -> 4 letters.

""OBIED"" -> not a word.

I think ""MOVIE"" is acceptable.

But let me see if there is a word with I in position 1 and ending with E without forbidden letters.

For example: ""INLET"" is invalid.

""ICED"" -> 4 letters.

""IDLER"" is invalid.

""IMPEL"" invalid.

""IMBUE"" -> ends with U.

""IMPLY"" -> ends with Y.

""INURE"" invalid.

""IVIED"" -> not a word? ""IVIED"" is not standard.

""OILER"" -> but ends with R? Not E, and R is forbidden.

""OILIE"" -> not a word.

So ""MOVIE"" might be one of the few options.

Another word: ""DIVIE"" -> not a word.

""JIVED"" -> J I V E D -> ends with D? Not E.

""JIGED"" -> not a word.

""KITED"" -> not a word.

""LIVED"" -> not a word.

""WIVED"" -> not a word.

So ""MOVIE"" is a valid word.

But note: we are testing V and O? And M.

Alternatively, we can try ""MOIRE"" -> M O I R E -> but R is forbidden -> invalid.

""NOISE"" -> N and S forbidden -> no.

""VOICE"" -> V O I C E -> C is forbidden -> invalid.

So I think ""MOVIE"" is a reasonable guess.

But wait, we have to consider that the word might have I in position 4? Or position 2? We are testing position 4.

If we get feedback that I is in the word but not in position 4, then we know it must be in position 1 or 2? But we are testing position 4.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 1 or 2.

But we couldn't find a common word with I in position 1 and ending with E without forbidden letters.

What about ""DWINE"" -> not a word.

""EXILE"" -> E X I L E -> but we have E at the beginning? And then I in position 3? But we are avoiding position 3 for I? Actually, we are forced to have I somewhere. But in ""EXILE"", I is in position 3? Then we know that position 3 is not I? But we are trying to test a new position? Actually, we are repeating position 3? We know I is not in position 3, so if we put I in position 3 again, we know it will be marked as '-' again? So it's inefficient.

But we are allowed to do that? But we are not learning new information about I's position.

We want to know where I is. So we should try it in a new position.

Therefore, ""MOVIE"" has I in position 4, which is new.

Another word: ""GIVEN"" -> G I V E N -> but N is forbidden -> invalid.

""LIKEN"" -> L I K E N -> N forbidden -> invalid.

""MIXED"" -> M I X E D -> ends with D? No.

""WIFED"" -> not a word.

So ""MOVIE"" is one of the few.

But note: there is ""BICEP"" -> but C and P forbidden -> no.

""FIELD"" -> ends with D.

""VIELD"" -> ends with D.

""HELIX"" -> ends with X.

""HELLO"" -> ends with O.

I think ""MOVIE"" is acceptable.

But let me check if there is a word with I in position 2.

For example: ""TITLE"" -> T forbidden.

""BIOME"" -> B I O M E -> ends with E? Yes: B-I-O-M-E -> positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:O, 4:M, 5:E. 
This word: ""BIOME"" -> B, I, O, M, E.
- Avoids forbidden letters? Yes: B, I, O, M, E. 
- I is in position 2, which is new.

And we test B, O, M.

This is also a valid word.

So we have two candidates: ""MOVIE"" (I in position 4) and ""BIOME"" (I in position 2).

Which one is better? Both test 4 new letters.

But we have to consider letter frequency.

Common letters: L, O, D, M, B, etc.

""BIOME"" tests B, O, M, and I (which we know) and E (known). 
""MOVIE"" tests M, O, V, and I, E.

V is less common than B? So ""BIOME"" might be better because B and O are more common.

But we don't know.

Another word: ""OZONE"" -> no I.

""URINE"" -> U R I N E -> R and N forbidden -> invalid.

""HELIX"" -> ends with X.

""HELLO"" -> ends with O.

""JUMBO"" -> no E.

I think both ""BIOME"" and ""MOVIE"" are acceptable.

But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both avoid them.

Let me choose ""BIOME"" because it tests B and O, which are common.

But we have to consider that the word might have O? We don't know.

Alternatively, we can try ""OILED"" but it doesn't end with E? It ends with D.

""OILED"" is O-I-L-E-D -> ends with D.

So not.

Another word: ""OXIDE"" -> O X I D E -> but we have I in position 3? Then we know position 3 is not I? And we are testing O and X? But X is rare.

But ""OXIDE"" is a word: O-X-I-D-E -> positions: 1:O, 2:X, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E. But we know I is not in position 3, so we know that will be '-' again. So we are testing O, X, D.

But X is rare, so maybe not.

""MOVIE"" is more common.

But let me see: we have to include I and E (at the end). So we are including I and E, and testing three new letters.

We can also consider ""DIVIE"" -> not a word.

""VIXEN"" -> V I X E N -> but N is forbidden -> invalid.

""VIMEN"" -> not a word.

So between ""BIOME"" and ""MOVIE"", I think ""MOVIE"" is more common and uses more common letters? M, O, V, I, E.

But V is less common. B is more common than V? In English, B is more common than V.

Letter frequency: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... then C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, ...

So M is more common than V, and B is more common than M? Actually, B is more common than M and V? Let me recall: 
Common letters: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... 
We have eliminated A, T, R, N, S, P. So the next common are: O, I, D, L, U, then M, F, Y, W, G, B, V, K.

So B is more common than V and M? Actually, B is about 1.7%, M is 2.4%, V is 2.1%. So B is more common than M and V.

But we are testing 4 letters: two of which are I and E, and two more.

In ""BIOME"": tests B, I, O, M, E -> B:1.7%, O:7.5%, M:2.4%, I:7.5%, E:12.7% (but we already know E is in, so we are testing the position of E? But we know E is at the end, so we are confirming that? Actually, we already know E is at the end, so we don't need to test E again? But we are using it to complete the word.

But we are allowed to reuse a known letter? Yes, but we know E is in the word and at the end, so we should keep it? Actually, we can change the position of E? But we know E is at the end, so we should keep it at the end? Not necessarily. We can test if there is another E? But we don't have any indication of another E. But we can use a word that has E in a different position? But we know the word has at least one E (at the end). If we put E in position 4, for example, we might get feedback if there is another E.

But in ""MOVIE"", we have E only at the end? So we are testing the E at the end, which we know is correct. We are not testing for another E.

In ""BIOME"", we have E at the end and also at position 4? No, ""BIOME"" has E at the end and no other E? Actually, ""BIOME"" has only one E? But we don't know if there is another E. The word ""BIOME"" has E at the end, and the middle has O, M, B. No other E.

""MOVIE"" has E only at the end? Actually, ""MOVIE"" is M-O-V-I-E, so only one E (at the end). But we are testing position 4 for I.

But we are not testing for another E.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has E in position 4? But we don't know if there is an E in position 4.

For example, ""OPINE"" -> O P I N E -> but P and N are forbidden -> invalid.

""URINE"" -> forbidden letters.

""EXILE"" -> forbidden letters.

""AXIOM"" -> no E and A forbidden.

I think ""MOVIE"" is fine.

But let me see if there is a word with I in position 1 and ending with E without forbidden letters.

For example: ""INLET"" invalid.

""ICED"" invalid.

""IDLER"" invalid.

""IMBUE"" -> ends with U.

""IMPLY"" -> ends with Y.

""INURE"" invalid.

""IVIED"" -> not a word.

""OBIED"" -> not a word.

""OGEED"" -> not a word.

""OILED"" -> ends with D.

""OMINE"" -> not a word.

""OLIVE"" -> O L I V E -> but I is in position 3? Then we know position 3 is not I? And we are testing O and L and V. But I is in position 3 again? So we get feedback on I: it will be '-' again? And we know that. So we are not learning the position of I.

But we are testing O, L, V.

But we have to avoid forbidden letters: O, L, V are not forbidden? Yes.

So ""OLIVE"" is a valid word: O-L-I-V-E -> positions: 1:O, 2:L, 3:I, 4:V, 5:E. 
But I is in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we will get '-' for I again? And we know that. So we are not testing a new position for I.

But we are testing O, L, V.

Alternatively, we can try ""OZONE"" -> no I.

""URINE"" invalid.

""EXILE"" invalid.

So ""OLIVE"" is an option, but with I in position 3 (which we know is wrong).

But we are testing O, L, V.

Another word: ""OXIDE"" -> O X I D E -> I in position 3? Same issue.

""OXIDE"" has I in position 3.

""MOVIE"" has I in position 4? Actually, ""MOVIE"" is M-O-V-I-E, so I is in position 4? Yes, position 4: I.

So ""MOVIE"" has I in position 4, which is new.

Similarly, ""BIOME"" has I in position 2? ""BIOME"" is B-I-O-M-E, so I in position 2.

So both are valid.

But ""MOVIE"" uses M, O, V, and I, E. 
""BIOME"" uses B, I, O, M, E.

We already know I and E are in the word, so we are testing the positions of I and E? But we know E is at position 5, so we are confirming that? Actually, we are using E at the end, which we know is correct.

But we are not testing for a second E.

In terms of information, both are similar.

But ""BIOME"" tests B and O, which are more common than M and V? Actually, B is more common than M? B:1.7%, M:2.4%, V:2.1%. So B is more common than V and M? M is more common than V? M:2.4%, V:2.1%, B:1.7%. So M is more common than V and B? Actually, M is more common than V and B? Let me order: 
E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... 
We have eliminated A, T, R, N, S, P. So the next common: O, I (we know), D, L, U, then M, V, B, F, Y, W, G, etc.

So O is very common (7.5%), D is common (4.3%), L is common (4.0%), U (2.8%), etc.

""BIOME"" tests B (1.7%), O (7.5%), M (2.4%), I (7.5%), E (12.7%) -> but we are testing I and E (which we know). So we are testing B, O, M.

""MOVIE"" tests M (2.4%), O (7.5%), V (2.1%), I (7.5%), E (12.7%). So we are testing M, O, V.

Comparing:
- ""BIOME"": tests B, O, M
- ""MOVIE"": tests M, O, V

B is more common than V and M? Actually, M is more common than B? M: 2.4%, B: 1.7%, V: 2.1%. So M is more common than B and V? Yes.

But we are testing three new letters in both.

We can also consider ""MOVIE"" because it tests V which is less common? But we might get information about V.

But I think ""BIOME"" is better because B and O are more common.

But let me check: we know the word has I and E, and we are testing I in position 2 (which might be correct? Or not). If we get feedback that I is in position 2, then we know. If not, then we know I must be in position 1 or 4? But we are testing position 2.

Similarly, in ""MOVIE"", we are testing I in position 4.

But we have to consider that the word might have I in position 1.

Is there a word with I in position 1 and ending with E without forbidden letters?

For example: 
  ""INLET"" -> invalid.
  ""ICED"" -> 4 letters.
  ""IDLER"" -> invalid.
  ""IMPEL"" -> invalid.
  ""IMBUE"" -> invalid.
  ""IMPLY"" -> invalid.
  ""INURE"" -> invalid.
  ""IVIED"" -> invalid.
  ""IXORA"" -> no E.

I think it's hard to find a common word with I at the start and ending with E.

Another: ""INATE"" -> N and A forbidden.

So I think we should go with ""BIOME"" or ""MOVIE"".

But let me see: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both are valid.

I'll choose ""BIOME"" because it tests B and O, which are more common than M and V? Actually, M is more common than B? M: 2.4%, B: 1.7%, V: 2.1%. So M is more common than B and V? Yes.

But ""BIOME"" has I in position 2, which is a position we haven't tested for I.

In ""spite"", we tested I in position 3. Now we are testing I in position 2.

If we get feedback that I is in position 2, then we know. If not, then we know I must be in position 1 or 4? But we are testing position 2.

Also, we are testing O in position 3 and M in position 4.

But we have to be cautious: if the word has I in position 1, then in ""BIOME"", the I in position 2 would be marked as '-'? And we know that? So we are not learning the position.

But we are testing B, O, M.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 1.

For example, ""IMBUE"" doesn't work.

""IMPLY"" doesn't work.

""INFER"" -> N and R forbidden.

""INCLE"" -> N and C forbidden.

""INDEED"" -> 6 letters.

I think it's difficult.

Another word: ""IMPEL"" is invalid.

""IMBUed"" -> not 5 letters.

I think we should go with ""MOVIE"" because it tests V which is less common? But we might get information about V.

But let me see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can use ""DOZEN"" -> but N is forbidden and ends with N? Not E.

""DOZEN"" is D-O-Z-E-N -> ends with N, not E.

So not.

""HOIYE"" -> not a word.

I think ""MOVIE"" is a valid choice.

But let me check if there is a word with I in position 4 and ending with E without forbidden letters.

For example: ""MOVIE"" is one.

""BIOME"" is the other.

But ""BIOME"" has I in position 2, which is more common? Actually, position 2 is more common for I than position 4? Not necessarily.

We can also consider ""OZONE"" -> no I.

""URINE"" invalid.

""EXILE"" invalid.

""AXIOM"" invalid.

""ELIDE"" -> E L I D E -> but we have E at the beginning? And then I in position 3? So I in position 3 again? And we know it's not position 3? So we are testing E at position 1? But we know E is at position 5, so if we put E at position 1, we might get feedback if there is another E? But we don't know.

""ELIDE"" -> E L I D E -> positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E. 
But we know I is not in position 3, so we know that will be '-' again. And we are testing E at position 1. If the secret word has E at position 1, we get a ✓, else if E is only at the end, we get a '-' for position 1 E? But we know there is at least one E (at the end). So if we put E at position 1, and if it's not in the word, we get 'x'. If it is, we get ✓.

But we are not testing the position of I.

And we are using two E's? We don't know if the word has two E's.

But we are testing position 1 for E? And we know position 5 is E, so if we get a '-' for position 1 E, then we know there is only one E (at the end) and it's not at the beginning? But we don't know if there is another E.

It's messy.

So I think it's better to avoid testing E in position 1 until we have more information.

But we are forced to have the word end with E.

Another word: ""BIDET"" -> not a common word? And T is forbidden.

""BIKIE"" -> not standard.

I think we should go with ""BIOME"" or ""MOVIE"".

Let me choose ""MOVIE"" because it tests V, which we haven't tested, and M is also new.

But M is more common than V? Yes.

So I'll go with ""MOVIE"".

But note: we are testing I in position 4. If it turns out that I is in position 2, we won't know until we test position 2.

But we have to start somewhere.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 1 and uses common letters? But we can't find one.

Another idea: ""IMDED"" -> not a word.

I think we have to choose between ""BIOME"" and ""MOVIE"".

I'll choose ""MOVIE"" because it uses V, which is less common, and if it turns out to be present, we get information. And if it's not, we eliminate V.

But let me see the frequency: M is more common than V? Yes.

But we are testing M, O, V.

In ""BIOME"", we test B, O, M.

Both are similar.

But note: we have to consider that the word might have O? We don't know.

I think ""MOVIE"" is a good choice.

But let me check: we know the word has I and E, and we are testing I in position 4. If we get feedback that I is in position 4, then we know. If not, then we know I must be in position 1 or 2? But we are testing position 4.

We can also consider ""OILED"" but it doesn't end with E.

Another word: ""MOLIE"" -> not a word? ""MOLIE"" is not standard.

""MOVIE"" is a standard word.

So I'll go with ""MOVIE"".

But wait, we have to avoid T? Yes, T is forbidden.

So ""MOVIE"" is valid.

Therefore, the third guess: ""MOVIE""

But let me write it: M-O-V-I-E.

So <guess>movie</guess>

But note: we are not sure if the word has M, O, V.

We are testing them.

If we get feedback:
- If M is in the word and in position 1, we get ✓. If not, we get x or -.
- Similarly for O and V.

And for I, we know it's in the word, so we expect at least a '-' for I (unless position 4 is correct, which we don't know).

But we are testing position 4 for I.

So I think it's a good guess.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 1 and uses common letters? But we can't find one.

Another word: ""INLET"" is invalid.

""ICED"" invalid.

I think ""MOVIE"" is acceptable.

But let me see if there is a word with I in position 2 and ending with E without forbidden letters.

For example: ""GUIDE"" -> G U I D E -> I in position 3? No, position 3 is I? Then we know it's not position 3? And we are testing G and U? But we don't know about G and U.

But ""GUIDE"" has I in position 3? Actually, position 2 is U, position 3 is I? Then we have: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E -> I in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we are testing I in position 3 again? We know it's not there, so we will get '-' again? So we are not learning the position.

But we are testing G, U, D.

D is common (4.3%), G is less common (2.2%), U is common (2.8%), D is common (4.3%), G is less common.

So ""GUIDE"" tests G, U, D, but I in position 3 (which we know is wrong).

So we are testing three new letters: G, U, D.

But we are repeating the same position for I.

So I think ""MOVIE"" is better because it tests I in a new position (position 4) and tests M, O, V.

So I'll go with ""MOVIE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **E** is confirmed in position 5 (✓ in both guesses).
- **I** is in the word but not in position 3 (from ""spite"" feedback).
- Forbidden letters (absent from the word): **C, R, A, N, S, P, T** (marked ""x"" in previous feedback).

For the next guess:
- The word must end with **E** (position 5).
- It must include **I** (but not in position 3).
- It should avoid forbidden letters and test new common letters (e.g., **M, O, V**).

I chose **MOVIE** because:
- It ends with **E**.
- It places **I** in position 4 (a new position to test).
- It introduces new common letters: **M, O, V**.
- It avoids all forbidden letters.

Some common letters are: S, T, L, O, I, D, M, P, etc.\n\n We can try a word that has a mix of these common letters and ends with E.\n\n Example words: \n   ""SLATE"" -> but A is not allowed (we know A is not in the word) and T is common.\n   ""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> but we don\'t know about these.\n\n However, note that we must avoid A, C, R, N.\n\n Let\'s think of words ending with E that do not contain A, C, R, N.\n\n Some possibilities:\n   ""STOLE"" -> S, T, O, L, E\n   ""SPIKE"" -> S, P, I, K, E\n   ""STYLE"" -> S, T, Y, L, E\n   ""SMITE"" -> S, M, I, T, E\n\n We also want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n Since we have only one letter fixed (E at the end), we can try to test multiple common letters.\n\n Let\'s choose ""STOLE"" because it has S, T, O, L which are common and we avoid the forbidden letters.\n\n But note: we are not sure if any of these are in the word. We are trying to get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we could choose a word that has a double E?

Since we don\'t have any indication of a double E, we can use distinct letters.\n\n Let\'s go with ""STOLE"".\n\n However, note that the word must be a valid 5-letter word.\n\n But wait: we know that the word has an E at the end, and we are avoiding A, C, R, N. So ""STOLE"" is a valid guess.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""SPITE"", but that has only 4 distinct letters? Actually, ""SPITE"" has S, P, I, T, E -> all distinct.\n\n But let me check: we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more vowels? We know that A is not in the word, so the vowels in the word might be E (at the end) and possibly O, I, U? \n\n We haven\'t tested O, I, U. So including a word that has O, I, U would be good.\n\n However, we also want to test common consonants. Let\'s compare:\n\n Option 1: ""STOLE"" -> tests S, T, O, L (and we already know E is at the end)\n Option 2: ""SPITE"" -> tests S, P, I, T (and E at the end)\n\n Both are good. But note that we have already eliminated A, so we are safe.\n\n I think ""SPITE"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (O and I) and three consonants (S, P, T) that we haven\'t tested.\n\n But wait: we have to avoid the letters we know are not present: C, R, A, N. Both words avoid these.\n\n Let me choose ""SPITE"". However, note that the feedback for the first word didn\'t have any yellow (wrong position) for the other letters? But we don\'t have any other information.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has the E at the end and uses new letters.\n\n I\'ll go with ""SPITE"".\n\n But note: the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""SPITE"" is a valid word.\n\n So the next guess: ""SPITE""\n\n However, let me double-check: we know the word has an E at the end, and we are avoiding A, C, R, N. So ""SPITE"" is acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""SLIME"", but that has M and I, and L. But note: we don\'t know about L, M, I, S.\n\n But we are trying to cover more common letters. The letters in ""SPITE"" are S, P, I, T, E. \n\n Another option: ""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E. But Q is less common and we might not want to use it.\n\n Since we are in the second guess, we can try to get as much information as possible.\n\n But note: we have only one letter fixed (E at the end). So we are trying to figure out the first four letters.\n\n We can also consider that the word might have repeated letters? But we don\'t have any evidence of that.\n\n Let me choose ""SPITE"".\n\n However, note that the word ""SPITE"" might not be the only possibility. But we are trying to get feedback.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that has more vowels? We know that A is out, so the vowels are likely E (at the end) and possibly O, I, U. So including O and I might be good.\n\n But ""SPITE"" only has I. \n\n Another word: ""SOOTE"" -> but that\'s not a common word? Actually, ""SOOTE"" is not valid.\n\n How about ""SLICE""? But we know C is not in the word (from the first feedback: C was x) so we cannot use C.\n\n We must avoid C, R, A, N.\n\n So let me think of words ending in E that do not contain C, R, A, N and use common letters.\n\n I\'ll go with ""SPITE"" because it uses S, P, I, T which are common.\n\n But note: we are not sure if the word has S, P, I, T. We are testing them.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""STOLE"" (S, T, O, L) but we are avoiding O? Actually, we haven\'t tested O and we know the word must have vowels. Since A is out, the vowels are likely E, O, I, U. So testing O and I might be good.\n\n But ""STOLE"" tests O and L, while ""SPITE"" tests I and T.\n\n Since T is more common than L, maybe ""SPITE"" is better.\n\n However, we have to consider that the word might have two E\'s? But we don\'t have any indication of that.\n\n After thinking, I\'ll go with ""SPITE"".\n\n But wait: what if the word is ""QUITE""? We wouldn\'t know. But we are trying to get information.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a word that has O and I? But we have to avoid the forbidden letters.\n\n I think ""SPITE"" is a reasonable guess.\n\n However, note that the word ""SPITE"" might be the actual word? But we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""SLIME"" to test S, L, I, M. But M is less common than T? \n\n Let me check the frequency of letters. In English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know A and N are out. So T, O, I, S, L are good.\n\n We can try to cover T, O, I, S, L? But we have only 4 positions (since the last is E). So we can test 4 new letters.\n\n But note: we are constrained by the word having 5 letters and ending with E.\n\n I think ""SPITE"" is a good choice because it tests S, P, I, T.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""SPITE"".\n\n But wait: what if the word has a double letter? We don\'t know. But we are not using double letters in this guess.\n\n Therefore, the next guess is ""SPITE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **E** is correct and in position 5 (so the secret word ends with **E**).\n- **C, R, A, N** are absent from the word entirely.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must end with **E**.\n- It should avoid **C, R, A, N**.\n- Prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **S, T, O, I, P**) to maximize information.\n\nI chose **SPITE** because:\n- It ends with **E**.\n- It avoids forbidden letters.\n- It tests 4 new high-frequency consonants/vowels (**S, P, I, T**).\n- It is a valid 5-letter word.\n\n<guess>spite</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: spite -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(-) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\n1. ""crane"": \n   C: x (not in the word)\n   R: x (not in the word)\n   A: x (not in the word)\n   N: x (not in the word)\n   E: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so the word ends with E)\n\n2. ""spite"":\n   S: x (not in the word)\n   P: x (not in the word)\n   I: - (in the word but wrong position)\n   T: x (not in the word)\n   E: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so the word ends with E)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The word ends with E (position 5 is E).\n- The letter I is in the word, but not in position 3 (since in ""spite"", I was in position 3 and got a \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not there).\n- The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, N, S, P, T.\n\nWe also know that the word contains I (somewhere except position 3) and E (at position 5).\n\nNow, we need to make a third guess. The word structure is: _ _ _ _ E\n\nWe know the word has an I, but not in position 3. So I could be in position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nWe must avoid the letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, T.\n\nWe have 6 tries, so we can try to test more common letters.\n\nWe need to choose a word that:\n- Ends with E (so position 5 is E)\n- Contains I (but not in position 3)\n- Avoids C, R, A, N, S, P, T\n- Uses new letters to get more information\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to test as many of these as possible, especially vowels (O, U, etc.) and common consonants (L, D, M, etc.).\n\nSince we know I is in the word, we can try to place I in a different position (like 1, 2, or 4) and test other common letters.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit the pattern: _ _ _ _ E, and include I (but not in position 3), and avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nPossible positions for I:\n- Position 1: I _ _ _ E\n- Position 2: _ I _ _ E\n- Position 4: _ _ _ I E\n\nWe also need to test other letters.\n\nLet\'s try to test O, L, D, M, etc.\n\nExample words:\n\nOption 1: Place I in position 1 and test other letters.\nFor example: ""IMAGE"" -> but A is forbidden (we know A is not in the word) so invalid.\n""INANE"" -> but N and A are forbidden -> invalid.\n""IDLER"" -> but R is forbidden -> invalid.\n\nWe must avoid A, C, R, N, S, P, T.\n\nSo let\'s try:\n\n- Position 1: I _ _ _ E\n  - We need three letters for positions 2,3,4 that are not forbidden and form a valid word.\n  - Example: ""ISLE"" -> but S and L? S is forbidden (from ""spite"" feedback: S was x) so we cannot use S.\n  - ""IDLER"" is invalid because of R.\n  - ""IGLOO"" -> no E at the end? It ends with O, not E. So not.\n\nWe need words ending with E. So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E.\n\nWith I in position 1: \n  ""INLET"" -> but N and T are forbidden -> invalid.\n  ""IMPEL"" -> but P and L? P is forbidden -> invalid.\n  ""IDYLL"" -> not ending with E and contains Y, but also not 5 distinct? Actually, ""IDYLL"" ends with L, not E.\n\nIt\'s hard to find a word with I at the start and ending with E without using forbidden letters.\n\nTry I in position 2: \n  _ I _ _ E\n  Example: ""TITLE"" -> but T is forbidden -> invalid.\n  ""BIBLE"" -> B, I, B, L, E -> but B is repeated? And we don\'t know if B is in the word. Also, we have two B\'s? But we can test B and L.\n  However, we must avoid forbidden letters: T is forbidden, but B and L are allowed? Yes, because we haven\'t tested them.\n\nBut note: ""BIBLE"" has two B\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has B or not. But it\'s a valid word.\n\nBut we are trying to get information. However, repeating B might not be efficient.\n\nAnother: ""DICEY"" -> but C is forbidden and doesn\'t end with E? It ends with Y.\n\nWe need words ending with E.\n\nAnother idea: ""QUITE"" -> but Q, U, I, T, E. But T is forbidden (from ""spite"" feedback: T was x) so we cannot use T.\n\nT is forbidden? Yes, from the feedback of ""spite"": T was marked x.\n\nSo we cannot use T.\n\nSimilarly, S, P are forbidden.\n\nSo let\'s list forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, T.\n\nWe can use: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nNow, for I: we know it\'s in the word, so we must include it.\n\nLet me try to form a word with I and other common letters.\n\nOption: ""OILED"" -> O, I, L, E, D? But wait, the pattern: position 1: O, 2: I, 3: L, 4: E, 5: D? But we need the fifth letter to be E, so that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe need the word to end with E. So the fifth letter is fixed as E.\n\nSo the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E\n\nWith I in position 2: \n  _ I _ _ E\n  Possible words: \n    ""BIBLE"" -> B I B L E -> but two B\'s and we test B and L.\n    ""TITLE"" -> T is forbidden -> invalid.\n    ""DICEY"" -> doesn\'t end with E and has C -> invalid.\n    ""LINED"" -> but N is forbidden -> invalid.\n    ""MIXED"" -> M I X E D -> but ends with D? No, we need E at the end. ""MIXED"" has E at position 4? Actually, it\'s M-I-X-E-D, so E is at position 4, D at 5. We need E at 5? So no.\n\nWe need the fifth letter to be E. So the word must be: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E.\n\nWith I in position 2: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] E.\n\nWe can try:\n  ""BIKE"" -> too short? 5 letters? No, ""BIKE"" is 4 letters.\n  ""BIKER"" -> 5 letters? But ends with R, not E.\n\nActually, we need 5 letters and ending with E.\n\nLet me think: \n  ""WIPED"" -> W I P E D -> but P is forbidden (from ""spite"") and also ends with D? No, we need E at the end. ""WIPED"" has E at position 4? Actually, W-I-P-E-D: positions: 1:W, 2:I, 3:P, 4:E, 5:D -> so E is at 4, D at 5. Not E at 5.\n\nWe need the fifth letter to be E. So the word must be: [letter1][letter2][letter3][letter4]E.\n\nSo for I in position 2: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] E.\n\nExamples:\n  ""QUITE"" -> but T is forbidden -> invalid.\n  ""JUICE"" -> J U I C E -> but C is forbidden -> invalid.\n  ""GUISE"" -> G U I S E -> but S is forbidden -> invalid.\n  ""GUIDE"" -> G U I D E -> but we have E at the end? Yes: G-U-I-D-E -> positions: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E. But wait, we have I in position 3? But in the feedback for ""spite"", I was in position 3 and got a \'-\' meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3 again, we know it will be wrong? But we are allowed to guess the same word? We are not forced to avoid repeating a known letter? Actually, we know I is in the word but not in position 3, so if we put I in position 3 again, we know it will be marked as \'-\' again? But we are trying to get new information. It\'s better to try I in a new position.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to guess the same word? But we know I is in the word, but we don\'t know its position. So we should try I in a position we haven\'t tried (i.e., not position 3) to see if it fits.\n\nIn ""spite"", I was in position 3. So we can try position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nBut in the pattern _ _ _ _ E, if we put I in position 2, then we have: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] E.\n\nWe need a valid word that fits: [letter1] I [letter3] [letter4] E.\n\nPossible words:\n  ""BIBLE"" -> B I B L E -> but has two B\'s. And we don\'t know about B and L. But we are testing B and L. Also, note that the second letter is I and the last is E.\n\nBut we have to avoid forbidden letters: B, L are not forbidden? Yes, because we haven\'t eliminated them.\n\nBut the word ""BIBLE"" has two B\'s. If the secret word has only one B, then the feedback for the B\'s might be tricky? But it\'s allowed.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word without repeated letters.\n\nWhat about ""WIDEN""? But ends with N, not E? And N is forbidden.\n\n""GUIDE"": G U I D E -> but in this case, I is in position 3? Actually, position 3 is I? Then we have: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E. But we know I is not in position 3? From the feedback of ""spite"", we know that I is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3 again, we know it will be marked as \'-\' again? But we are trying to get new information. It\'s better to try I in a new position.\n\nSo we should avoid position 3 for I.\n\nTherefore, for the next guess, we can try I in position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nLet me try to find words with I in position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nWith I in position 1: \n  I _ _ _ E\n  Examples: \n    ""IMAGE"" -> A forbidden -> no.\n    ""INLET"" -> N and T forbidden -> no.\n    ""ISLE"" -> S forbidden -> no.\n    ""IDLER"" -> R forbidden -> no.\n    ""IGLOE"" -> not a word? \n    ""INNED"" -> N forbidden -> no.\n\nIt\'s hard. Let me think of common words.\n\nHow about ""IMBUE""? But ends with U, not E.\n\nWe need to end with E.\n\nAnother: ""INVITE"" -> 6 letters? No.\n\n""ILLUS"" -> not ending with E.\n\nPerhaps ""IMPEL"" -> but P and L? P is forbidden.\n\nI\'m struggling. Let me try I in position 4: \n  _ _ _ I E\n  Examples:\n    ""MOVIE"" -> M O V I E -> but we have E at the end? Yes: M-O-V-I-E -> positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:V, 4:I, 5:E. \n    This word: ""MOVIE"" -> M, O, V, I, E. \n    Avoids forbidden letters? Yes: M, O, V, I, E. \n    But we have I in position 4? That\'s a new position.\n\nAlso, we test M, O, V, and we already know I and E.\n\nBut note: we are testing O and V? And M.\n\nThis seems good.\n\nAnother possibility: ""DIVIE"" -> not a word? \n""QUITE"" is invalid because of T.\n\n""MOVIE"" is a valid word.\n\nWe can also consider ""OZONE"" -> but doesn\'t have I and ends with E? O-Z-O-N-E -> no I, and N is forbidden.\n\nWe must include I because we know it\'s in the word.\n\nSo ""MOVIE"" is a candidate.\n\nWith I in position 2: \n  _ I _ _ E\n  ""GUIDE"" -> G U I D E -> but I is in position 3? Actually, position 3 is I? Then we have: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E -> so I is in position 3. But we know I is not in position 3? So we shouldn\'t put I in position 3 again? Actually, we can, but we know it will be marked as \'-\' again? So it\'s a waste of a position? We want to test new positions.\n\nBut we are forced to have the fifth letter E. So we can try I in position 2.\n\nWord: ""DICEY"" -> doesn\'t end with E.\n\n""LIGHT"" -> no E.\n\n""BIKIE"" -> not standard.\n\n""MIKVE"" -> not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""LIVED"" -> L I V E D -> but ends with D? Not E.\n\nIt\'s difficult to find a word with I in position 2 and ending with E.\n\nWhat about ""WIPED"" -> W I P E D -> ends with D? No.\n\n""MINCE"" -> M I N C E -> but N and C are forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""WINCE"" -> W I N C E -> forbidden letters.\n\nSo maybe position 2 is hard.\n\nPosition 1: \n  I _ _ _ E\n  ""ITCHY"" -> ends with Y? Not E.\n  ""IMPLY"" -> ends with Y? Not E.\n  ""INBOX"" -> no E.\n\nHow about ""INURE"" -> but R and N forbidden -> invalid.\n\nI think position 1 is not easy.\n\nPosition 4:\n  _ _ _ I E\n  ""MOVIE"" -> M O V I E -> as above.\n\nAnother: ""HAPPY"" -> no E and forbidden A.\n\n""JUMBO"" -> no E.\n\n""LUCRE"" -> R forbidden -> no.\n\n""MOVIE"" seems good.\n\nBut note: we are testing O, V, M. \n\nWe could also try ""DIVIE"" -> not a word.\n\n""QUINE"" -> Q U I N E -> but N is forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""QUITE"" -> T forbidden -> invalid.\n\nSo ""MOVIE"" is a valid option.\n\nBut let me check: ""MOVIE"" -> M O V I E. \n- Position 1: M\n- Position 2: O\n- Position 3: V\n- Position 4: I\n- Position 5: E (fixed)\n\nWe know I is in the word, and we are putting it in position 4. If the secret word has I in position 4, we get a ✓ for I? Or if not, we get a \'-\' or \'x\'. But we know I is in the word, so it won\'t be \'x\'. It could be \'-\' if it\'s in the word but not in position 4, or ✓ if it is in position 4.\n\nAlso, we test M, O, V.\n\nAnother candidate: ""OILED"" -> O I L E D -> but ends with D? Not E.\n\n""TIMED"" -> T forbidden -> no.\n\n""VIMEN"" -> not a word.\n\n""MOVIE"" seems a good choice.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if O, V, M are in the word. We are testing them.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 1 or 2 and uses more common letters.\n\nWhat about ""LIVE?"" -> 4 letters.\n\n""IVEY"" -> 4 letters.\n\n""OBIED"" -> not a word.\n\nI think ""MOVIE"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word with I in position 1 and ending with E without forbidden letters.\n\nFor example: ""INLET"" is invalid.\n\n""ICED"" -> 4 letters.\n\n""IDLER"" is invalid.\n\n""IMPEL"" invalid.\n\n""IMBUE"" -> ends with U.\n\n""IMPLY"" -> ends with Y.\n\n""INURE"" invalid.\n\n""IVIED"" -> not a word? ""IVIED"" is not standard.\n\n""OILER"" -> but ends with R? Not E, and R is forbidden.\n\n""OILIE"" -> not a word.\n\nSo ""MOVIE"" might be one of the few options.\n\nAnother word: ""DIVIE"" -> not a word.\n\n""JIVED"" -> J I V E D -> ends with D? Not E.\n\n""JIGED"" -> not a word.\n\n""KITED"" -> not a word.\n\n""LIVED"" -> not a word.\n\n""WIVED"" -> not a word.\n\nSo ""MOVIE"" is a valid word.\n\nBut note: we are testing V and O? And M.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""MOIRE"" -> M O I R E -> but R is forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""NOISE"" -> N and S forbidden -> no.\n\n""VOICE"" -> V O I C E -> C is forbidden -> invalid.\n\nSo I think ""MOVIE"" is a reasonable guess.\n\nBut wait, we have to consider that the word might have I in position 4? Or position 2? We are testing position 4.\n\nIf we get feedback that I is in the word but not in position 4, then we know it must be in position 1 or 2? But we are testing position 4.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 1 or 2.\n\nBut we couldn\'t find a common word with I in position 1 and ending with E without forbidden letters.\n\nWhat about ""DWINE"" -> not a word.\n\n""EXILE"" -> E X I L E -> but we have E at the beginning? And then I in position 3? But we are avoiding position 3 for I? Actually, we are forced to have I somewhere. But in ""EXILE"", I is in position 3? Then we know that position 3 is not I? But we are trying to test a new position? Actually, we are repeating position 3? We know I is not in position 3, so if we put I in position 3 again, we know it will be marked as \'-\' again? So it\'s inefficient.\n\nBut we are allowed to do that? But we are not learning new information about I\'s position.\n\nWe want to know where I is. So we should try it in a new position.\n\nTherefore, ""MOVIE"" has I in position 4, which is new.\n\nAnother word: ""GIVEN"" -> G I V E N -> but N is forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""LIKEN"" -> L I K E N -> N forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""MIXED"" -> M I X E D -> ends with D? No.\n\n""WIFED"" -> not a word.\n\nSo ""MOVIE"" is one of the few.\n\nBut note: there is ""BICEP"" -> but C and P forbidden -> no.\n\n""FIELD"" -> ends with D.\n\n""VIELD"" -> ends with D.\n\n""HELIX"" -> ends with X.\n\n""HELLO"" -> ends with O.\n\nI think ""MOVIE"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let me check if there is a word with I in position 2.\n\nFor example: ""TITLE"" -> T forbidden.\n\n""BIOME"" -> B I O M E -> ends with E? Yes: B-I-O-M-E -> positions: 1:B, 2:I, 3:O, 4:M, 5:E. \nThis word: ""BIOME"" -> B, I, O, M, E.\n- Avoids forbidden letters? Yes: B, I, O, M, E. \n- I is in position 2, which is new.\n\nAnd we test B, O, M.\n\nThis is also a valid word.\n\nSo we have two candidates: ""MOVIE"" (I in position 4) and ""BIOME"" (I in position 2).\n\nWhich one is better? Both test 4 new letters.\n\nBut we have to consider letter frequency.\n\nCommon letters: L, O, D, M, B, etc.\n\n""BIOME"" tests B, O, M, and I (which we know) and E (known). \n""MOVIE"" tests M, O, V, and I, E.\n\nV is less common than B? So ""BIOME"" might be better because B and O are more common.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nAnother word: ""OZONE"" -> no I.\n\n""URINE"" -> U R I N E -> R and N forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""HELIX"" -> ends with X.\n\n""HELLO"" -> ends with O.\n\n""JUMBO"" -> no E.\n\nI think both ""BIOME"" and ""MOVIE"" are acceptable.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both avoid them.\n\nLet me choose ""BIOME"" because it tests B and O, which are common.\n\nBut we have to consider that the word might have O? We don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""OILED"" but it doesn\'t end with E? It ends with D.\n\n""OILED"" is O-I-L-E-D -> ends with D.\n\nSo not.\n\nAnother word: ""OXIDE"" -> O X I D E -> but we have I in position 3? Then we know position 3 is not I? And we are testing O and X? But X is rare.\n\nBut ""OXIDE"" is a word: O-X-I-D-E -> positions: 1:O, 2:X, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E. But we know I is not in position 3, so we know that will be \'-\' again. So we are testing O, X, D.\n\nBut X is rare, so maybe not.\n\n""MOVIE"" is more common.\n\nBut let me see: we have to include I and E (at the end). So we are including I and E, and testing three new letters.\n\nWe can also consider ""DIVIE"" -> not a word.\n\n""VIXEN"" -> V I X E N -> but N is forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""VIMEN"" -> not a word.\n\nSo between ""BIOME"" and ""MOVIE"", I think ""MOVIE"" is more common and uses more common letters? M, O, V, I, E.\n\nBut V is less common. B is more common than V? In English, B is more common than V.\n\nLetter frequency: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... then C, M, F, Y, W, G, P, B, V, K, ...\n\nSo M is more common than V, and B is more common than M? Actually, B is more common than M and V? Let me recall: \nCommon letters: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... \nWe have eliminated A, T, R, N, S, P. So the next common are: O, I, D, L, U, then M, F, Y, W, G, B, V, K.\n\nSo B is more common than V and M? Actually, B is about 1.7%, M is 2.4%, V is 2.1%. So B is more common than M and V.\n\nBut we are testing 4 letters: two of which are I and E, and two more.\n\nIn ""BIOME"": tests B, I, O, M, E -> B:1.7%, O:7.5%, M:2.4%, I:7.5%, E:12.7% (but we already know E is in, so we are testing the position of E? But we know E is at the end, so we are confirming that? Actually, we already know E is at the end, so we don\'t need to test E again? But we are using it to complete the word.\n\nBut we are allowed to reuse a known letter? Yes, but we know E is in the word and at the end, so we should keep it? Actually, we can change the position of E? But we know E is at the end, so we should keep it at the end? Not necessarily. We can test if there is another E? But we don\'t have any indication of another E. But we can use a word that has E in a different position? But we know the word has at least one E (at the end). If we put E in position 4, for example, we might get feedback if there is another E.\n\nBut in ""MOVIE"", we have E only at the end? So we are testing the E at the end, which we know is correct. We are not testing for another E.\n\nIn ""BIOME"", we have E at the end and also at position 4? No, ""BIOME"" has E at the end and no other E? Actually, ""BIOME"" has only one E? But we don\'t know if there is another E. The word ""BIOME"" has E at the end, and the middle has O, M, B. No other E.\n\n""MOVIE"" has E only at the end? Actually, ""MOVIE"" is M-O-V-I-E, so only one E (at the end). But we are testing position 4 for I.\n\nBut we are not testing for another E.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has E in position 4? But we don\'t know if there is an E in position 4.\n\nFor example, ""OPINE"" -> O P I N E -> but P and N are forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""URINE"" -> forbidden letters.\n\n""EXILE"" -> forbidden letters.\n\n""AXIOM"" -> no E and A forbidden.\n\nI think ""MOVIE"" is fine.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word with I in position 1 and ending with E without forbidden letters.\n\nFor example: ""INLET"" invalid.\n\n""ICED"" invalid.\n\n""IDLER"" invalid.\n\n""IMBUE"" -> ends with U.\n\n""IMPLY"" -> ends with Y.\n\n""INURE"" invalid.\n\n""IVIED"" -> not a word.\n\n""OBIED"" -> not a word.\n\n""OGEED"" -> not a word.\n\n""OILED"" -> ends with D.\n\n""OMINE"" -> not a word.\n\n""OLIVE"" -> O L I V E -> but I is in position 3? Then we know position 3 is not I? And we are testing O and L and V. But I is in position 3 again? So we get feedback on I: it will be \'-\' again? And we know that. So we are not learning the position of I.\n\nBut we are testing O, L, V.\n\nBut we have to avoid forbidden letters: O, L, V are not forbidden? Yes.\n\nSo ""OLIVE"" is a valid word: O-L-I-V-E -> positions: 1:O, 2:L, 3:I, 4:V, 5:E. \nBut I is in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we will get \'-\' for I again? And we know that. So we are not testing a new position for I.\n\nBut we are testing O, L, V.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""OZONE"" -> no I.\n\n""URINE"" invalid.\n\n""EXILE"" invalid.\n\nSo ""OLIVE"" is an option, but with I in position 3 (which we know is wrong).\n\nBut we are testing O, L, V.\n\nAnother word: ""OXIDE"" -> O X I D E -> I in position 3? Same issue.\n\n""OXIDE"" has I in position 3.\n\n""MOVIE"" has I in position 4? Actually, ""MOVIE"" is M-O-V-I-E, so I is in position 4? Yes, position 4: I.\n\nSo ""MOVIE"" has I in position 4, which is new.\n\nSimilarly, ""BIOME"" has I in position 2? ""BIOME"" is B-I-O-M-E, so I in position 2.\n\nSo both are valid.\n\nBut ""MOVIE"" uses M, O, V, and I, E. \n""BIOME"" uses B, I, O, M, E.\n\nWe already know I and E are in the word, so we are testing the positions of I and E? But we know E is at position 5, so we are confirming that? Actually, we are using E at the end, which we know is correct.\n\nBut we are not testing for a second E.\n\nIn terms of information, both are similar.\n\nBut ""BIOME"" tests B and O, which are more common than M and V? Actually, B is more common than M? B:1.7%, M:2.4%, V:2.1%. So B is more common than V and M? M is more common than V? M:2.4%, V:2.1%, B:1.7%. So M is more common than V and B? Actually, M is more common than V and B? Let me order: \nE, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, ... \nWe have eliminated A, T, R, N, S, P. So the next common: O, I (we know), D, L, U, then M, V, B, F, Y, W, G, etc.\n\nSo O is very common (7.5%), D is common (4.3%), L is common (4.0%), U (2.8%), etc.\n\n""BIOME"" tests B (1.7%), O (7.5%), M (2.4%), I (7.5%), E (12.7%) -> but we are testing I and E (which we know). So we are testing B, O, M.\n\n""MOVIE"" tests M (2.4%), O (7.5%), V (2.1%), I (7.5%), E (12.7%). So we are testing M, O, V.\n\nComparing:\n- ""BIOME"": tests B, O, M\n- ""MOVIE"": tests M, O, V\n\nB is more common than V and M? Actually, M is more common than B? M: 2.4%, B: 1.7%, V: 2.1%. So M is more common than B and V? Yes.\n\nBut we are testing three new letters in both.\n\nWe can also consider ""MOVIE"" because it tests V which is less common? But we might get information about V.\n\nBut I think ""BIOME"" is better because B and O are more common.\n\nBut let me check: we know the word has I and E, and we are testing I in position 2 (which might be correct? Or not). If we get feedback that I is in position 2, then we know. If not, then we know I must be in position 1 or 4? But we are testing position 2.\n\nSimilarly, in ""MOVIE"", we are testing I in position 4.\n\nBut we have to consider that the word might have I in position 1.\n\nIs there a word with I in position 1 and ending with E without forbidden letters?\n\nFor example: \n  ""INLET"" -> invalid.\n  ""ICED"" -> 4 letters.\n  ""IDLER"" -> invalid.\n  ""IMPEL"" -> invalid.\n  ""IMBUE"" -> invalid.\n  ""IMPLY"" -> invalid.\n  ""INURE"" -> invalid.\n  ""IVIED"" -> invalid.\n  ""IXORA"" -> no E.\n\nI think it\'s hard to find a common word with I at the start and ending with E.\n\nAnother: ""INATE"" -> N and A forbidden.\n\nSo I think we should go with ""BIOME"" or ""MOVIE"".\n\nBut let me see: we have to avoid the forbidden letters. Both are valid.\n\nI\'ll choose ""BIOME"" because it tests B and O, which are more common than M and V? Actually, M is more common than B? M: 2.4%, B: 1.7%, V: 2.1%. So M is more common than B and V? Yes.\n\nBut ""BIOME"" has I in position 2, which is a position we haven\'t tested for I.\n\nIn ""spite"", we tested I in position 3. Now we are testing I in position 2.\n\nIf we get feedback that I is in position 2, then we know. If not, then we know I must be in position 1 or 4? But we are testing position 2.\n\nAlso, we are testing O in position 3 and M in position 4.\n\nBut we have to be cautious: if the word has I in position 1, then in ""BIOME"", the I in position 2 would be marked as \'-\'? And we know that? So we are not learning the position.\n\nBut we are testing B, O, M.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 1.\n\nFor example, ""IMBUE"" doesn\'t work.\n\n""IMPLY"" doesn\'t work.\n\n""INFER"" -> N and R forbidden.\n\n""INCLE"" -> N and C forbidden.\n\n""INDEED"" -> 6 letters.\n\nI think it\'s difficult.\n\nAnother word: ""IMPEL"" is invalid.\n\n""IMBUed"" -> not 5 letters.\n\nI think we should go with ""MOVIE"" because it tests V which is less common? But we might get information about V.\n\nBut let me see the feedback we might get.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""DOZEN"" -> but N is forbidden and ends with N? Not E.\n\n""DOZEN"" is D-O-Z-E-N -> ends with N, not E.\n\nSo not.\n\n""HOIYE"" -> not a word.\n\nI think ""MOVIE"" is a valid choice.\n\nBut let me check if there is a word with I in position 4 and ending with E without forbidden letters.\n\nFor example: ""MOVIE"" is one.\n\n""BIOME"" is the other.\n\nBut ""BIOME"" has I in position 2, which is more common? Actually, position 2 is more common for I than position 4? Not necessarily.\n\nWe can also consider ""OZONE"" -> no I.\n\n""URINE"" invalid.\n\n""EXILE"" invalid.\n\n""AXIOM"" invalid.\n\n""ELIDE"" -> E L I D E -> but we have E at the beginning? And then I in position 3? So I in position 3 again? And we know it\'s not position 3? So we are testing E at position 1? But we know E is at position 5, so if we put E at position 1, we might get feedback if there is another E? But we don\'t know.\n\n""ELIDE"" -> E L I D E -> positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E. \nBut we know I is not in position 3, so we know that will be \'-\' again. And we are testing E at position 1. If the secret word has E at position 1, we get a ✓, else if E is only at the end, we get a \'-\' for position 1 E? But we know there is at least one E (at the end). So if we put E at position 1, and if it\'s not in the word, we get \'x\'. If it is, we get ✓.\n\nBut we are not testing the position of I.\n\nAnd we are using two E\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two E\'s.\n\nBut we are testing position 1 for E? And we know position 5 is E, so if we get a \'-\' for position 1 E, then we know there is only one E (at the end) and it\'s not at the beginning? But we don\'t know if there is another E.\n\nIt\'s messy.\n\nSo I think it\'s better to avoid testing E in position 1 until we have more information.\n\nBut we are forced to have the word end with E.\n\nAnother word: ""BIDET"" -> not a common word? And T is forbidden.\n\n""BIKIE"" -> not standard.\n\nI think we should go with ""BIOME"" or ""MOVIE"".\n\nLet me choose ""MOVIE"" because it tests V, which we haven\'t tested, and M is also new.\n\nBut M is more common than V? Yes.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""MOVIE"".\n\nBut note: we are testing I in position 4. If it turns out that I is in position 2, we won\'t know until we test position 2.\n\nBut we have to start somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 1 and uses common letters? But we can\'t find one.\n\nAnother idea: ""IMDED"" -> not a word.\n\nI think we have to choose between ""BIOME"" and ""MOVIE"".\n\nI\'ll choose ""MOVIE"" because it uses V, which is less common, and if it turns out to be present, we get information. And if it\'s not, we eliminate V.\n\nBut let me see the frequency: M is more common than V? Yes.\n\nBut we are testing M, O, V.\n\nIn ""BIOME"", we test B, O, M.\n\nBoth are similar.\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the word might have O? We don\'t know.\n\nI think ""MOVIE"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me check: we know the word has I and E, and we are testing I in position 4. If we get feedback that I is in position 4, then we know. If not, then we know I must be in position 1 or 2? But we are testing position 4.\n\nWe can also consider ""OILED"" but it doesn\'t end with E.\n\nAnother word: ""MOLIE"" -> not a word? ""MOLIE"" is not standard.\n\n""MOVIE"" is a standard word.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""MOVIE"".\n\nBut wait, we have to avoid T? Yes, T is forbidden.\n\nSo ""MOVIE"" is valid.\n\nTherefore, the third guess: ""MOVIE""\n\nBut let me write it: M-O-V-I-E.\n\nSo <guess>movie</guess>\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has M, O, V.\n\nWe are testing them.\n\nIf we get feedback:\n- If M is in the word and in position 1, we get ✓. If not, we get x or -.\n- Similarly for O and V.\n\nAnd for I, we know it\'s in the word, so we expect at least a \'-\' for I (unless position 4 is correct, which we don\'t know).\n\nBut we are testing position 4 for I.\n\nSo I think it\'s a good guess.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has I in position 1 and uses common letters? But we can\'t find one.\n\nAnother word: ""INLET"" is invalid.\n\n""ICED"" invalid.\n\nI think ""MOVIE"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word with I in position 2 and ending with E without forbidden letters.\n\nFor example: ""GUIDE"" -> G U I D E -> I in position 3? No, position 3 is I? Then we know it\'s not position 3? And we are testing G and U? But we don\'t know about G and U.\n\nBut ""GUIDE"" has I in position 3? Actually, position 2 is U, position 3 is I? Then we have: 1:G, 2:U, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E -> I in position 3, which we know is wrong. So we are testing I in position 3 again? We know it\'s not there, so we will get \'-\' again? So we are not learning the position.\n\nBut we are testing G, U, D.\n\nD is common (4.3%), G is less common (2.2%), U is common (2.8%), D is common (4.3%), G is less common.\n\nSo ""GUIDE"" tests G, U, D, but I in position 3 (which we know is wrong).\n\nSo we are testing three new letters: G, U, D.\n\nBut we are repeating the same position for I.\n\nSo I think ""MOVIE"" is better because it tests I in a new position (position 4) and tests M, O, V.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""MOVIE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **E** is confirmed in position 5 (✓ in both guesses).\n- **I** is in the word but not in position 3 (from ""spite"" feedback).\n- Forbidden letters (absent from the word): **C, R, A, N, S, P, T** (marked ""x"" in previous feedback).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must end with **E** (position 5).\n- It must include **I** (but not in position 3).\n- It should avoid forbidden letters and test new common letters (e.g., **M, O, V**).\n\nI chose **MOVIE** because:\n- It ends with **E**.\n- It places **I** in position 4 (a new position to test).\n- It introduces new common letters: **M, O, V**.\n- It avoids all forbidden letters.\n\n<guess>movie</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: spite -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(-) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: movie -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) V(x) I(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for three guesses:

1. ""crane"": 
   C: x (not in the word)
   R: x (not in the word)
   A: x (not in the word)
   N: x (not in the word)
   E: ✓ (correct and in position 5)

2. ""spite"":
   S: x (not in the word)
   P: x (not in the word)
   I: - (in the word but wrong position)
   T: x (not in the word)
   E: ✓ (correct and in position 5)

3. ""movie"":
   M: x (not in the word)
   O: ✓ (correct and in position 2)
   V: x (not in the word)
   I: ✓ (correct and in position 4)
   E: ✓ (correct and in position 5)

From this, we know:
- The word has the following correct letters in these positions:
  Position 2: O
  Position 4: I
  Position 5: E
- The word also contains the letter I, which we now know is in position 4.
- Additionally, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, P, T, M, V.

So the current known structure is: _ O _ I E

We are missing the first and third letters.

We also know that the word contains I (now confirmed at position 4) and E (at position 5), and we know O is at position 2.

The third letter is unknown, but we know it is not one of the forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, T, M, V.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with two letters from this set, forming a valid English word.

The word pattern: [letter1] O [letter3] I E

We have to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses only allowed letters.

We also know that the first letter cannot be any of the forbidden letters, and the same for the third letter.

Let's think of possible words:

- Position 1: Can be B, D, F, G, H, K, L, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z? But we need the word to be valid.

Common words that fit the pattern _ O _ I E:

- ""GOUGE"" -> G O U G E? But we have two G's? And the third letter is U. But is U allowed? Yes. But we have G at position 1 and 4? The pattern requires position 1 to be filled, then O, then position 3 to be filled, then I, then E. So ""GOUGE"" would be: G O U G E -> positions: 1:G, 2:O, 3:U, 4:G, 5:E. But we have G at position 1 and 4? But the pattern only asks for positions 1 and 3. So it's valid? But we don't know if G is in the word. And we are testing U.

But ""GOUGE"" has two G's. If the secret word has only one G, we might get feedback that the first G is correct (if in position 1) and the third U is correct? But if the word has only one G, then the fourth G might be marked as absent? But we are testing two G's? Actually, the word ""GOUGE"" has two G's, so if the secret word has only one G, then one of the G's might be marked as '-' if it's in the word but wrong position? But we don't know if there is a G in the word.

But we are trying to get information.

Other possibilities:

- ""DOZIE"" -> not a word.
- ""BOWIE"" -> B O W I E -> is that a word? ""BOWIE"" is a word (a type of knife). But we have W in position 3. And B in position 1.

But we haven't tested B, W, and we know O, I, E are correct.

But in the pattern, position 1 is B, position 3 is W? So ""BOWIE"".

But we must check if B and W are allowed? Yes, they are not in the forbidden list.

Forbidden: C,R,A,N,S,P,T,M,V. So B and W are allowed.

Similarly, ""BOWIE"" is a valid word.

Another word: ""HOWIE"" -> not common.

""BOXIE"" -> not a word.

""COZIE"" -> C is forbidden.

""FOCUS"" -> doesn't end with E.

""GUILD"" -> no E.

""GLOVE"" -> G L O V E -> but V is forbidden? From ""movie"" feedback: V was x. So V is not in the word. So we cannot use V.

In ""BOWIE"", we have B, O, W, I, E. 
- B: not forbidden? Yes.
- O: correct at position 2.
- W: not forbidden? Yes.
- I: correct at position 4.
- E: correct at position 5.

So ""BOWIE"" is a candidate.

Another word: ""DOWIE"" -> not a word? ""DOWIE"" is not standard.

""ROWIE"" -> not a word.

""POWER"" -> ends with R, not E.

""BOXED"" -> ends with D.

""JOKED"" -> ends with D.

""SOBER"" -> S forbidden, ends with R.

""COVER"" -> C and R forbidden.

""HOVER"" -> ends with R.

""LOVER"" -> ends with R.

""POKER"" -> P and R forbidden.

""COVER"" -> C and R forbidden.

""MOVER"" -> M and R forbidden.

""ROVER"" -> R and O? R forbidden.

""BOXER"" -> R forbidden.

""FOYER"" -> R forbidden.

""GOFER"" -> R forbidden.

""GONER"" -> R forbidden.

""CONER"" -> C and R forbidden.

""TONER"" -> T and R forbidden.

""LINER"" -> R forbidden.

""MINER"" -> M and R forbidden.

"" DINER"" -> R forbidden.

""WINER"" -> R forbidden.

""BIKER"" -> R forbidden.

So no R.

What about ""BOWIE""? That seems valid.

Another word: ""BOWIE"" is acceptable.

But we also have ""BOWIE"" as a candidate.

Another possibility: ""DOXIE"" -> not a word.

""DOGIE"" -> not a word.

""DOZIE"" -> not a word.

""FOCUS"" -> no.

""GUILD"" -> no E.

""GLOVE"" -> G L O V E -> but V is forbidden? From ""movie"" feedback: V was x. So V is not in the word. So we cannot use V.

In ""BOWIE"", we don't use V.

Similarly, ""BOWIE"" only uses B, O, W, I, E.

So it's valid.

But we have to check if there are other words.

Another word: ""HOWIE"" -> not common, but ""HOWIE"" is not standard.

""JOKE"" -> 4 letters.

""JOKED"" -> ends with D.

""JUICY"" -> no E.

""KODAK"" -> no E.

""LOVED"" -> ends with D.

""MOVED"" -> ends with D.

""ROVED"" -> R forbidden.

""SOBER"" -> S forbidden.

""TOWER"" -> T forbidden.

""VOWED"" -> V forbidden.

""WIPED"" -> ends with D.

""WIVED"" -> not a word.

""YOWED"" -> Y O W E D -> ends with D? Not E.

So ""BOWIE"" seems a good candidate.

But we have to make sure that we are not repeating a position? We are putting I in position 4, which we already know is correct? But we are testing the first and third letters.

In ""BOWIE"", the first letter is B and third is W.

We haven't tested B and W before.

Another word: ""COVET"" -> C forbidden.

""DEVIL"" -> ends with L.

""DEVIL"" is D-E-V-I-L -> ends with L, not E.

""DEMON"" -> ends with N, forbidden.

""DEVON"" -> not E.

""DEPOT"" -> no E.

I think ""BOWIE"" is a valid and common word.

But let me confirm: ""BOWIE"" is a 5-letter word meaning a type of knife or Bowie.

So we can use that.

But we have to avoid the forbidden letters: BOWIE has B, O, W, I, E. 
- B: not forbidden? Yes.
- O: correct at position 2.
- W: not forbidden? Yes.
- I: correct at position 4.
- E: correct at position 5.

So it fits.

But we are not sure if the third letter is W? We are testing it.

Alternatively, we can try ""DOZIE"" -> not a word.

""GOFIE"" -> not a word.

""GONIE"" -> not a word.

""GOOE"" -> not 5 letters.

""GOUGE"" -> G O U G E -> but we have G at position 1 and 4? So two G's. But the pattern requires position 1 and 3 to be filled. In ""GOUGE"", position 1 is G, position 3 is U, position 4 is G? So we have G at 1 and 4? But we are testing G at position 1 and U at position 3.

But we don't know if G is in the word. And we are testing U.

But ""GOUGE"" has two G's, which might be inefficient if G is not in the word.

But we are trying to get information.

Another word: ""HOMED"" -> ends with D.

""HOWIE"" -> not standard.

""JOKED"" -> ends with D.

""JOKER"" -> R forbidden.

""KITED"" -> ends with D.

""LOVED"" -> ends with D.

""MOVED"" -> ends with D.

""ROVED"" -> R forbidden.

""SOBER"" -> S forbidden.

""TOWER"" -> T forbidden.

""VOWED"" -> V forbidden.

""WIPED"" -> ends with D.

""WIVED"" -> not a word.

""YOWED"" -> ends with D.

So ""BOWIE"" seems a good option.

But we have another candidate: ""BOXIE"" -> not a word.

""DOXIE"" -> not a word.

""DOGIE"" -> not a word.

""DOZIE"" -> not a word.

""FOCUS"" -> no.

""GUILD"" -> no E.

""GLOVE"" -> G L O V E -> but V is forbidden, so invalid.

""GROVE"" -> R forbidden.

""GROWN"" -> no E.

So I think ""BOWIE"" is a valid and common word.

Therefore, I will guess ""BOWIE"".

But note: we are testing B and W. If they are not in the word, we get 'x'. If they are, we get feedback.

But we are also testing the third position with W.

So let's go with ""BOWIE"".

But wait, what about ""BOXED""? Ends with D, not E.

""BOXER"" -> R forbidden.

So I think ""BOWIE"" is the best.

But let me see if there is a word with I in position 1? But we couldn't find one.

Another word: ""IOKIA"" -> not ending with E.

I think we should go with ""BOWIE"".

So the guess is ""BOWIE"".

But note: we are not sure if the third letter is W? But we are testing it.

Alternatively, we can try ""DOZIE"" -> not a word.

""HOIST"" -> no E.

I think ""BOWIE"" is acceptable.

But let me confirm the pattern: 
Position 1: B
Position 2: O (correct)
Position 3: W
Position 4: I (correct)
Position 5: E (correct)

So we are testing B and W.

If the word is ""BOWIE"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on B and W.

But we have only 3 guesses left? We are on guess 4.

We can also consider ""HOWIE"" but it's not common.

Or ""JOKE"" is 4 letters.

I think ""BOWIE"" is a good choice.

But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""BOWIE"" is a valid word.

Another word: ""DOXIE"" -> not a word.

""DOGIE"" -> not a word.

""DOZIE"" -> not a word.

""FOCUS"" -> no.

So I think we should guess ""BOWIE"".

But wait, what about ""BOOZE""? Ends with E? B-O-O-Z-E -> ends with E? Actually, ""BOOZE"" is B-O-O-Z-E -> positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:O, 4:Z, 5:E. But we have O at position 2 and 3? But we know O is at position 2, so if we put O at position 3, we might get feedback? But we don't know if there is a second O.

But the pattern requires position 2 to be O, position 4 to be I, position 5 to be E. So position 3 must be filled.

""BOOZE"" has O at position 2 and 3? So it would be: 1:B, 2:O, 3:O, 4:Z, 5:E. But we need position 4 to be I? No, position 4 must be I? The pattern is _ O _ I E, so position 4 is I. In ""BOOZE"", position 4 is Z, not I. So it doesn't fit.

So we must have I at position 4.

Therefore, the only common word I can think of is ""BOWIE"".

Another word: ""HOWIE"" -> not standard.

""JOKE"" -> 4 letters.

""JOKED"" -> ends with D.

""KITED"" -> ends with D.

""LOVED"" -> ends with D.

""TOXIC"" -> no E and C forbidden.

So I think ""BOWIE"" is the best.

Therefore, we guess ""BOWIE"".

But note: we are testing W. We haven't tested W.

In ""BOWIE"", we test B and W.

If we get feedback that B is not in the word, we know position 1 is not B. If B is in the word, we get a ✓ or '-'.

Similarly for W.

But we are testing position 1 and 3.

So let's go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Position 2**: O is correct (✓).
- **Position 4**: I is correct (✓).
- **Position 5**: E is correct (✓).
- **Forbidden letters**: C, R, A, N, S, P, T, M, V (all marked ""x"").
- **Known letters in the word**: O (pos 2), I (pos 4), E (pos 5), and one more letter (pos 1 and 3) that must be from the remaining allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

The word pattern is: [letter1] O [letter3] I E

After evaluating possible words, **""BOWIE""** is the most common valid word that fits this pattern and avoids forbidden letters. It tests:
- **B** at position 1 (new letter).
- **O** at position 2 (already confirmed, but required).
- **W** at position 3 (new letter).
- **I** at position 4 (already confirmed, but required).
- **E** at position 5 (already confirmed, but required).

This guess will provide feedback on B and W, helping to solve the remaining positions.

<guess>bowie</guess>",bowie,"We are given feedback for three guesses:

1. ""crane"": 
   C: x (not in the word)
   R: x (not in the word)
   A: x (not in the word)
   N: x (not in the word)
   E: ✓ (correct and in position 5)

2. ""spite"":
   S: x (not in the word)
   P: x (not in the word)
   I: - (in the word but wrong position)
   T: x (not in the word)
   E: ✓ (correct and in position 5)

3. ""movie"":
   M: x (not in the word)
   O: ✓ (correct and in position 2)
   V: x (not in the word)
   I: ✓ (correct and in position 4)
   E: ✓ (correct and in position 5)

From this, we know:
- The word has the following correct letters in these positions:
  Position 2: O
  Position 4: I
  Position 5: E
- The word also contains the letter I, which we now know is in position 4.
- Additionally, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, S, P, T, M, V.

So the current known structure is: _ O _ I E

We are missing the first and third letters.

We also know that the word contains I (now confirmed at position 4) and E (at position 5), and we know O is at position 2.

The third letter is unknown, but we know it is not one of the forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters: C, R, A, N, S, P, T, M, V.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to fill positions 1 and 3 with two letters from this set, forming a valid English word.

The word pattern: [letter1] O [letter3] I E

We have to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses only allowed letters.

We also know that the first letter cannot be any of the forbidden letters, and the same for the third letter.

Let's think of possible words:

- Position 1: Can be B, D, F, G, H, K, L, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z? But we need the word to be valid.

Common words that fit the pattern _ O _ I E:

- ""GOUGE"" -> G O U G E? But we have two G's? And the third letter is U. But is U allowed? Yes. But we have G at position 1 and 4? The pattern requires position 1 to be filled, then O, then position 3 to be filled, then I, then E. So ""GOUGE"" would be: G O U G E -> positions: 1:G, 2:O, 3:U, 4:G, 5:E. But we have G at position 1 and 4? But the pattern only asks for positions 1 and 3. So it's valid? But we don't know if G is in the word. And we are testing U.

But ""GOUGE"" has two G's. If the secret word has only one G, we might get feedback that the first G is correct (if in position 1) and the third U is correct? But if the word has only one G, then the fourth G might be marked as absent? But we are testing two G's? Actually, the word ""GOUGE"" has two G's, so if the secret word has only one G, then one of the G's might be marked as '-' if it's in the word but wrong position? But we don't know if there is a G in the word.

But we are trying to get information.

Other possibilities:

- ""DOZIE"" -> not a word.
- ""BOWIE"" -> B O W I E -> is that a word? ""BOWIE"" is a word (a type of knife). But we have W in position 3. And B in position 1.

But we haven't tested B, W, and we know O, I, E are correct.

But in the pattern, position 1 is B, position 3 is W? So ""BOWIE"".

But we must check if B and W are allowed? Yes, they are not in the forbidden list.

Forbidden: C,R,A,N,S,P,T,M,V. So B and W are allowed.

Similarly, ""BOWIE"" is a valid word.

Another word: ""HOWIE"" -> not common.

""BOXIE"" -> not a word.

""COZIE"" -> C is forbidden.

""FOCUS"" -> doesn't end with E.

""GUILD"" -> no E.

""GLOVE"" -> G L O V E -> but V is forbidden? From ""movie"" feedback: V was x. So V is not in the word. So we cannot use V.

In ""BOWIE"", we have B, O, W, I, E. 
- B: not forbidden? Yes.
- O: correct at position 2.
- W: not forbidden? Yes.
- I: correct at position 4.
- E: correct at position 5.

So ""BOWIE"" is a candidate.

Another word: ""DOWIE"" -> not a word? ""DOWIE"" is not standard.

""ROWIE"" -> not a word.

""POWER"" -> ends with R, not E.

""BOXED"" -> ends with D.

""JOKED"" -> ends with D.

""SOBER"" -> S forbidden, ends with R.

""COVER"" -> C and R forbidden.

""HOVER"" -> ends with R.

""LOVER"" -> ends with R.

""POKER"" -> P and R forbidden.

""COVER"" -> C and R forbidden.

""MOVER"" -> M and R forbidden.

""ROVER"" -> R and O? R forbidden.

""BOXER"" -> R forbidden.

""FOYER"" -> R forbidden.

""GOFER"" -> R forbidden.

""GONER"" -> R forbidden.

""CONER"" -> C and R forbidden.

""TONER"" -> T and R forbidden.

""LINER"" -> R forbidden.

""MINER"" -> M and R forbidden.

"" DINER"" -> R forbidden.

""WINER"" -> R forbidden.

""BIKER"" -> R forbidden.

So no R.

What about ""BOWIE""? That seems valid.

Another word: ""BOWIE"" is acceptable.

But we also have ""BOWIE"" as a candidate.

Another possibility: ""DOXIE"" -> not a word.

""DOGIE"" -> not a word.

""DOZIE"" -> not a word.

""FOCUS"" -> no.

""GUILD"" -> no E.

""GLOVE"" -> G L O V E -> but V is forbidden? From ""movie"" feedback: V was x. So V is not in the word. So we cannot use V.

In ""BOWIE"", we don't use V.

Similarly, ""BOWIE"" only uses B, O, W, I, E.

So it's valid.

But we have to check if there are other words.

Another word: ""HOWIE"" -> not common, but ""HOWIE"" is not standard.

""JOKE"" -> 4 letters.

""JOKED"" -> ends with D.

""JUICY"" -> no E.

""KODAK"" -> no E.

""LOVED"" -> ends with D.

""MOVED"" -> ends with D.

""ROVED"" -> R forbidden.

""SOBER"" -> S forbidden.

""TOWER"" -> T forbidden.

""VOWED"" -> V forbidden.

""WIPED"" -> ends with D.

""WIVED"" -> not a word.

""YOWED"" -> Y O W E D -> ends with D? Not E.

So ""BOWIE"" seems a good candidate.

But we have to make sure that we are not repeating a position? We are putting I in position 4, which we already know is correct? But we are testing the first and third letters.

In ""BOWIE"", the first letter is B and third is W.

We haven't tested B and W before.

Another word: ""COVET"" -> C forbidden.

""DEVIL"" -> ends with L.

""DEVIL"" is D-E-V-I-L -> ends with L, not E.

""DEMON"" -> ends with N, forbidden.

""DEVON"" -> not E.

""DEPOT"" -> no E.

I think ""BOWIE"" is a valid and common word.

But let me confirm: ""BOWIE"" is a 5-letter word meaning a type of knife or Bowie.

So we can use that.

But we have to avoid the forbidden letters: BOWIE has B, O, W, I, E. 
- B: not forbidden? Yes.
- O: correct at position 2.
- W: not forbidden? Yes.
- I: correct at position 4.
- E: correct at position 5.

So it fits.

But we are not sure if the third letter is W? We are testing it.

Alternatively, we can try ""DOZIE"" -> not a word.

""GOFIE"" -> not a word.

""GONIE"" -> not a word.

""GOOE"" -> not 5 letters.

""GOUGE"" -> G O U G E -> but we have G at position 1 and 4? So two G's. But the pattern requires position 1 and 3 to be filled. In ""GOUGE"", position 1 is G, position 3 is U, position 4 is G? So we have G at 1 and 4? But we are testing G at position 1 and U at position 3.

But we don't know if G is in the word. And we are testing U.

But ""GOUGE"" has two G's, which might be inefficient if G is not in the word.

But we are trying to get information.

Another word: ""HOMED"" -> ends with D.

""HOWIE"" -> not standard.

""JOKED"" -> ends with D.

""JOKER"" -> R forbidden.

""KITED"" -> ends with D.

""LOVED"" -> ends with D.

""MOVED"" -> ends with D.

""ROVED"" -> R forbidden.

""SOBER"" -> S forbidden.

""TOWER"" -> T forbidden.

""VOWED"" -> V forbidden.

""WIPED"" -> ends with D.

""WIVED"" -> not a word.

""YOWED"" -> ends with D.

So ""BOWIE"" seems a good option.

But we have another candidate: ""BOXIE"" -> not a word.

""DOXIE"" -> not a word.

""DOGIE"" -> not a word.

""DOZIE"" -> not a word.

""FOCUS"" -> no.

""GUILD"" -> no E.

""GLOVE"" -> G L O V E -> but V is forbidden, so invalid.

""GROVE"" -> R forbidden.

""GROWN"" -> no E.

So I think ""BOWIE"" is a valid and common word.

Therefore, I will guess ""BOWIE"".

But note: we are testing B and W. If they are not in the word, we get 'x'. If they are, we get feedback.

But we are also testing the third position with W.

So let's go with ""BOWIE"".

But wait, what about ""BOXED""? Ends with D, not E.

""BOXER"" -> R forbidden.

So I think ""BOWIE"" is the best.

But let me see if there is a word with I in position 1? But we couldn't find one.

Another word: ""IOKIA"" -> not ending with E.

I think we should go with ""BOWIE"".

So the guess is ""BOWIE"".

But note: we are not sure if the third letter is W? But we are testing it.

Alternatively, we can try ""DOZIE"" -> not a word.

""HOIST"" -> no E.

I think ""BOWIE"" is acceptable.

But let me confirm the pattern: 
Position 1: B
Position 2: O (correct)
Position 3: W
Position 4: I (correct)
Position 5: E (correct)

So we are testing B and W.

If the word is ""BOWIE"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on B and W.

But we have only 3 guesses left? We are on guess 4.

We can also consider ""HOWIE"" but it's not common.

Or ""JOKE"" is 4 letters.

I think ""BOWIE"" is a good choice.

But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""BOWIE"" is a valid word.

Another word: ""DOXIE"" -> not a word.

""DOGIE"" -> not a word.

""DOZIE"" -> not a word.

""FOCUS"" -> no.

So I think we should guess ""BOWIE"".

But wait, what about ""BOOZE""? Ends with E? B-O-O-Z-E -> ends with E? Actually, ""BOOZE"" is B-O-O-Z-E -> positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:O, 4:Z, 5:E. But we have O at position 2 and 3? But we know O is at position 2, so if we put O at position 3, we might get feedback? But we don't know if there is a second O.

But the pattern requires position 2 to be O, position 4 to be I, position 5 to be E. So position 3 must be filled.

""BOOZE"" has O at position 2 and 3? So it would be: 1:B, 2:O, 3:O, 4:Z, 5:E. But we need position 4 to be I? No, position 4 must be I? The pattern is _ O _ I E, so position 4 is I. In ""BOOZE"", position 4 is Z, not I. So it doesn't fit.

So we must have I at position 4.

Therefore, the only common word I can think of is ""BOWIE"".

Another word: ""HOWIE"" -> not standard.

""JOKE"" -> 4 letters.

""JOKED"" -> ends with D.

""KITED"" -> ends with D.

""LOVED"" -> ends with D.

""TOXIC"" -> no E and C forbidden.

So I think ""BOWIE"" is the best.

Therefore, we guess ""BOWIE"".

But note: we are testing W. We haven't tested W.

In ""BOWIE"", we test B and W.

If we get feedback that B is not in the word, we know position 1 is not B. If B is in the word, we get a ✓ or '-'.

Similarly for W.

But we are testing position 1 and 3.

So let's go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Position 2**: O is correct (✓).
- **Position 4**: I is correct (✓).
- **Position 5**: E is correct (✓).
- **Forbidden letters**: C, R, A, N, S, P, T, M, V (all marked ""x"").
- **Known letters in the word**: O (pos 2), I (pos 4), E (pos 5), and one more letter (pos 1 and 3) that must be from the remaining allowed letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.

The word pattern is: [letter1] O [letter3] I E

After evaluating possible words, **""BOWIE""** is the most common valid word that fits this pattern and avoids forbidden letters. It tests:
- **B** at position 1 (new letter).
- **O** at position 2 (already confirmed, but required).
- **W** at position 3 (new letter).
- **I** at position 4 (already confirmed, but required).
- **E** at position 5 (already confirmed, but required).

This guess will provide feedback on B and W, helping to solve the remaining positions.",Guess 4: bowie -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) O(✓) W(✓) I(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
