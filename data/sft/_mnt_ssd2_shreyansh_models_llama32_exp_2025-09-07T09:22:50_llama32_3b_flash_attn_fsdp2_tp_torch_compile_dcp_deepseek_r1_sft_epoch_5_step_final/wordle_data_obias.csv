We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, from this we know:
 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, E.

 Since we have 6 tries, we need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word.

 We must choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter A (because we know it's in the word) but not in the third position.
 2. Does not contain C, R, N, E.
 3. Should try to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible. We have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E). The remaining consonants and vowels are important.

 We know the word has an A. Since A is not in position 3, it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We should try to use a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters that we haven't tested yet.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C, R, N, E) might include: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 We also note that the word must have 5 distinct letters? Actually, not necessarily. But for maximum information, we might prefer distinct letters.

 Let's try to form a word that has A and other common letters, and avoid the eliminated ones.

 Possible words: 
   We can try words with A in the first position? But note: we don't know if A is in position 1 or not. We only know it's not in position 3.

 Example: ""AUDIO"" - but that has A in position 1 and 4? And we haven't tested U, D, I, O. But note: we have eliminated E, so AUDIO is acceptable? Let's check: A, U, D, I, O. None of these are in the eliminated set (C, R, N, E). So that's a candidate.

 However, we might also consider words that have A in other positions.

 Another common word: ""PLAIT"" - but that has A in position 3? But wait, we know A is not in position 3? Actually, no: the feedback for A was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot put A in position 3 again.

 Therefore, in ""PLAIT"", if we put A in position 3, that would be the same position that we already know is wrong. So we should avoid that.

 Let's try to put A in a new position. Since it was in position 3 and was wrong, we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Another idea: ""SALAD"" - but that has two A's? And we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we have eliminated R, N, E, so S, A, L, D are acceptable? But SALAD has A in position 2 and 4. However, we don't know if the word has two A's. It might.

 But note: we have only one A confirmed so far? Actually, the feedback for A was one '-' meaning at least one A is present. It could have more.

 However, we want to maximize new information. So using two A's might not be efficient? But it could be.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with A in position 1: ""ABOUT""
 But ABOUT has B, O, U, T. And A in position 1.

 However, we don't know if B, O, U, T are in the word. So ABOUT is a valid guess? But note: we have eliminated R, N, E, but B, O, U, T are new.

 But wait: we have to avoid the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E. So ABOUT is acceptable.

 Another candidate: ""PLAIT"" is not good because A is in position 3 (which we know is wrong). So avoid position 3 for A.

 How about ""PAINT""? But PAINT has N? We have eliminated N. So no.

 How about ""MAILS""? 
 M, A, I, L, S. 
 A is in position 2? 
 And we avoid the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E.

 SoMAILS is a candidate.

 Another: ""TAILS""? T, A, I, L, S. A in position 2? 

 But note: we don't know if T, I, L, S are in the word.

 However, we have two candidates: ABOUT andMAILS andTAILS.

 But we want to cover more common letters? 

 Let me think: we have already tested A, and we know it's in the word. We have tested C, R, N, E and they are out.

 Now, we can try to test other vowels? We have not tested I, O, U. 

 Also, we have not tested S, T, L, D, etc.

 ABOUT: A, B, O, U, T -> tests B, O, U, T (and A in a new position)
 MAILS: M, A, I, L, S -> tests M, I, L, S (and A in position 2)

 TAILS: T, A, I, L, S -> tests T, I, L, S (and A in position 2)

 Which one is better? 

 We might prefer about because it tests U and O? 

 But note: we have only 5 positions. We can test more vowels? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4 or 5? 

 Example: ""SPAIL"" - but that's not a common word? And we don't know if S, P, A, I, L are in the word. But SPAIL is not standard.

 How about ""STAMP""? But that has A in position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A.

 So we cannot use STAMP.

 How about ""PASTA""? 
 P, A, S, T, A -> but two A's? And A is in position 2 and 5? 
 But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are repeating A in position 2 and 5? 

 However, PASTA is a valid word.

 But let's avoid repeating A for now? Because if the word has only one A, then we might get confusing feedback? 

 Actually, if the word has one A, then in PASTA the A in position 2 would be correct? But wait, we don't know the position of A.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a new position and uses distinct letters.

 Let me list some words that have A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 and avoid C, R, N, E:

 Position 1: 
   ABOUT: A, B, O, U, T -> distinct letters, avoids C,R,N,E.
   ABOVE: A, B, O, V, E -> but E is eliminated? So we cannot use E.

   So ABOUT is acceptable.

 Position 2:
  MAILS: M, A, I, L, S -> distinct, avoids C,R,N,E.
   TAILS: T, A, I, L, S -> distinct.

 Position 4:
   We don't have many words? How about ""FOCAL""? But FOCAL has C and L? C is eliminated. So no.
   ""LOCAL""? L, O, C, A, L -> C is eliminated? Yes, C is out. So no.

   ""VOCAL""? V, O, C, A, L -> C is eliminated? Yes.

   ""DATAL""? Not a word.

   How about ""STALE""? But E is eliminated.

   So it's hard to find words with A in position 4? 

   How about ""DIARY""? D, I, A, R, Y -> but R is eliminated? R is in the eliminated list.

   So avoid R.

 Position 5:
   Words ending with A? Like ""PIZZA""? But Z is not common. 
   ""AROMA""? But A is repeated? And we have R and M? R is eliminated.

   How about ""MANGA""? M, A, N, G, A -> N is eliminated? So no.

   ""TABLA""? T, A, B, L, A -> distinct? And avoids C,R,N,E? Yes.

 But TABLA has A in position 2 and 5? 

 Alternatively, we can try ""TABLA"" or ""MAILS"" or ""TAILS"".

 However, we have not tested S, T, L, etc. 

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

 How about ""SAULT""? Not a common word.

 Let me stick with ABOUT: A in position 1, and letters B, O, U, T.

 But note: we have already tested A? Actually, we haven't tested it in the context of the secret word, but we know A is present. So using A again in position 1 might be good? Because if it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it's in another position.

 However, we are trying to maximize new letters. ABOUT uses A, B, O, U, T. We know A is in the word, so we are testing B, O, U, T.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't repeat A? But we don't have to repeat A? We can leave it out? But we know A is in the word, so we should use it? Actually, we can choose not to use A? But then we wouldn't get information about other positions of A? 

 However, the rules: we must include A? No, we don't have to. But if we don't include A, we won't get information about the position of A. 

 But we have 5 tries left? Actually, we have used 1, so 5 left? But we are making the second guess.

 Since we know A is in the word, we should use it to try to find its correct position.

 So I think ABOUT is a good candidate.

 But let me check: ABOUT: A in position 1, B in position 2, O in 3, U in 4, T in 5.

 We know A is not in position 3? But we are putting it in position 1. So if the secret word has A in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it's in 2,4, or 5.

 Also, we are testing B, O, U, T.

 Alternatively, we can try ""AUDIO"" which is a common second guess? But AUDIO has A in position 1 and 4? And we are testing U, D, I, O. But we have two A's? 

 We don't know if the word has two A's? So AUDIO might be acceptable? But it repeats A.

 However, AUDIO: A in position 1 and 4. If the secret word has only one A, then the A in position 1 might be a minus and the A in position 4 might be an x? 

 But we are trying to get maximum information. ABOUT seems better because it uses distinct letters.

 Another word: ""ADIEU"" - but that has E and we know E is eliminated? So no.

 So between ABOUT and AUDIO, ABOUT seems better because it uses distinct letters and tests more consonants.

 But note: we have not tested S, T, L, etc. 

 Another candidate: ""SALET"" (a word in word lists) -> S, A, L, E, T -> but E is eliminated? So no.

 How about ""HASTY""? H, A, S, T, Y -> distinct, avoids C,R,N,E? Yes. And A is in position 2.

 HASTY: positions: H(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5)

 This tests H, A, S, T, Y. We know A is in the word, so we are testing H, S, T, Y.

 But note: we are testing A again? Actually, we are putting A in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it's in 1,4, or 5.

 Also, we are testing H, S, T, Y.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> distinct? Yes, but repeated A.

 PASTA: A in position 2 and 5.

 We are testing P, S, T, and A (twice). It might be less efficient? 

 I think ABOUT is a good choice.

 But let me see: we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E). The remaining letters are more or less common? 

 Common letters left: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, B, G, Y, etc.

 We can also consider ""BAILS"": B, A, I, L, S -> distinct, avoids C,R,N,E? Yes. A in position 2.

 BAILS: tests B, A, I, L, S.

 Now, comparing:
   ABOUT: tests A (position 1), B, O, U, T.
   BAILS: tests A (position 2), B, I, L, S.

 Which one? 

 We have not tested S, T, L, O, etc. 

 Both are valid. But ABOUT tests T and O? And BAILS tests L and S? 

 Since S and T are very common, ABOUT might be better? 

 However, we have to consider that the word might have S? 

 But we don't know. 

 Another word: ""TALON"" -> T, A, L, O, N -> but N is eliminated? So no.

 How about ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> tests P, S, T, and A (twice). It tests S and T? 

 But we have two A's? So we are testing two positions for A? 

 However, we are only testing 4 new letters? (since A is repeated). 

 I think ABOUT is better because it tests 5 new distinct letters? 

 But note: we are testing A again? Actually, we are testing it in a new position? 

 ABOUT: A in position 1, B in 2, O in 3, U in 4, T in 5.

 We know that A is not in position 3? So we are testing position 1 for A.

 If we get a check for A, then we know it's in position 1. If we get a minus, then A is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in 2,4, or 5.

 Also, we are testing B, O, U, T.

 So I'll go with ABOUT.

 But wait: what if the word has A in position 2? Then ABOUT will show A as not in position 1? And we'll know it's in 2? 

 However, we are testing A in position 1. If it's not there, then we know A is in 2,4, or 5.

 So let's decide on ABOUT.

 But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters. ABOUT is free of C, R, N, E.

 So I'll guess ""ABOUT"".

 However, let me double-check: 
   A: we know is in the word, but we are testing position 1.
   B, O, U, T: new letters.

 This seems good.

 So the second guess: ""ABOUT""

 But note: we are using O and U? We don't know if they are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4? 

 How about ""DELTA""? D, E, L, T, A -> but E is eliminated? So no.

 How about "" ALPHA""? A, L, P, H, A -> repeated A? And A in position 1 and 5? 

 But we are testing A again? And we are testing L, P, H.

 But we have two A's? 

 I think ABOUT is better.

 Another word: ""AMPLY""? A, M, P, L, Y -> distinct letters? Yes. And avoids C,R,N,E? Yes.

 AMPLY: A in position 1, M, P, L, Y.

 This tests M, P, L, Y and A (in position 1).

 This is also a candidate.

 Now, we have:
   ABOUT: tests A (pos1), B, O, U, T
   AMPLY: tests A (pos1), M, P, L, Y
   BAILS: tests A (pos2), B, I, L, S

 Which one? 

 We have not tested S, T, L, O, etc. 

 AMPLY tests M, P, L, Y? 

 But S and T are more common than M and Y? 

 However, we are testing A in the same position as before? In the first guess A was in position 3? Now we are putting it in position 1. 

 If we get a check for A, then we know it's in position 1. If not, we know it's in 2,4, or 5.

 I think ABOUT is a good choice.

 But let me see: we have eliminated R, N, E, C. 

 The most common letters left are S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, B, G, Y, F, etc.

 We can also consider ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T -> but no A? We must include A? Actually, we don't have to include A? But we know A is in the word, so if we don't include A, we won't get information about its position? 

 However, we are allowed to guess without A? But that might not be efficient. 

 Actually, we can use a word that doesn't have A? But then we are wasting a guess? Because we know A is in the word and we haven't tested it in other positions? 

 So we should include A.

 I think ABOUT is a solid choice.

 Let me write it: 

 Guess: A B O U T

 But note: we are testing A in position 1. If the secret word has A in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know A is in 2,4, or 5.

 Also, we are testing B, O, U, T.

 So I'll go with ""ABOUT"".

 However, we must ensure that ""ABOUT"" is a valid word? Yes, it is.

 Therefore, second guess: ""ABOUT""

 But wait: what if the word has A in position 2? Then ABOUT will show A as not in position 1? And we'll get a minus for A? Then we know A is in 2? 

 But we are not testing position 2? We are testing position 1. 

 Alternatively, we can test position 2? 

 How about ""SALAD""? S, A, L, A, D -> repeated A? And A in position 2 and 4? 

 But we are testing S, A, L, D. And we are testing A in two positions? 

 But we have only 5 distinct letters? 

 I think ABOUT is better.

 Final decision: ""ABOUT""

<guess>about</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **avoid position 3**.
- Must **exclude C, R, N, E**.
- Should prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **S, T, L, O, B**) to gather more information.

The word **ABOUT** fits these criteria:
- Places **A in position 1** (a new position to test).
- Tests new common letters: **B, O, U, T**.
- Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, E) and repeated letters.
- Is a valid English word.

This guess will help identify the position of **A** and test four new letters.

<guess>about</guess>",about,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, from this we know:
 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, E.

 Since we have 6 tries, we need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word.

 We must choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter A (because we know it's in the word) but not in the third position.
 2. Does not contain C, R, N, E.
 3. Should try to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible. We have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E). The remaining consonants and vowels are important.

 We know the word has an A. Since A is not in position 3, it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We should try to use a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters that we haven't tested yet.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C, R, N, E) might include: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 We also note that the word must have 5 distinct letters? Actually, not necessarily. But for maximum information, we might prefer distinct letters.

 Let's try to form a word that has A and other common letters, and avoid the eliminated ones.

 Possible words: 
   We can try words with A in the first position? But note: we don't know if A is in position 1 or not. We only know it's not in position 3.

 Example: ""AUDIO"" - but that has A in position 1 and 4? And we haven't tested U, D, I, O. But note: we have eliminated E, so AUDIO is acceptable? Let's check: A, U, D, I, O. None of these are in the eliminated set (C, R, N, E). So that's a candidate.

 However, we might also consider words that have A in other positions.

 Another common word: ""PLAIT"" - but that has A in position 3? But wait, we know A is not in position 3? Actually, no: the feedback for A was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot put A in position 3 again.

 Therefore, in ""PLAIT"", if we put A in position 3, that would be the same position that we already know is wrong. So we should avoid that.

 Let's try to put A in a new position. Since it was in position 3 and was wrong, we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Another idea: ""SALAD"" - but that has two A's? And we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we have eliminated R, N, E, so S, A, L, D are acceptable? But SALAD has A in position 2 and 4. However, we don't know if the word has two A's. It might.

 But note: we have only one A confirmed so far? Actually, the feedback for A was one '-' meaning at least one A is present. It could have more.

 However, we want to maximize new information. So using two A's might not be efficient? But it could be.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with A in position 1: ""ABOUT""
 But ABOUT has B, O, U, T. And A in position 1.

 However, we don't know if B, O, U, T are in the word. So ABOUT is a valid guess? But note: we have eliminated R, N, E, but B, O, U, T are new.

 But wait: we have to avoid the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E. So ABOUT is acceptable.

 Another candidate: ""PLAIT"" is not good because A is in position 3 (which we know is wrong). So avoid position 3 for A.

 How about ""PAINT""? But PAINT has N? We have eliminated N. So no.

 How about ""MAILS""? 
 M, A, I, L, S. 
 A is in position 2? 
 And we avoid the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E.

 SoMAILS is a candidate.

 Another: ""TAILS""? T, A, I, L, S. A in position 2? 

 But note: we don't know if T, I, L, S are in the word.

 However, we have two candidates: ABOUT andMAILS andTAILS.

 But we want to cover more common letters? 

 Let me think: we have already tested A, and we know it's in the word. We have tested C, R, N, E and they are out.

 Now, we can try to test other vowels? We have not tested I, O, U. 

 Also, we have not tested S, T, L, D, etc.

 ABOUT: A, B, O, U, T -> tests B, O, U, T (and A in a new position)
 MAILS: M, A, I, L, S -> tests M, I, L, S (and A in position 2)

 TAILS: T, A, I, L, S -> tests T, I, L, S (and A in position 2)

 Which one is better? 

 We might prefer about because it tests U and O? 

 But note: we have only 5 positions. We can test more vowels? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4 or 5? 

 Example: ""SPAIL"" - but that's not a common word? And we don't know if S, P, A, I, L are in the word. But SPAIL is not standard.

 How about ""STAMP""? But that has A in position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A.

 So we cannot use STAMP.

 How about ""PASTA""? 
 P, A, S, T, A -> but two A's? And A is in position 2 and 5? 
 But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are repeating A in position 2 and 5? 

 However, PASTA is a valid word.

 But let's avoid repeating A for now? Because if the word has only one A, then we might get confusing feedback? 

 Actually, if the word has one A, then in PASTA the A in position 2 would be correct? But wait, we don't know the position of A.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a new position and uses distinct letters.

 Let me list some words that have A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 and avoid C, R, N, E:

 Position 1: 
   ABOUT: A, B, O, U, T -> distinct letters, avoids C,R,N,E.
   ABOVE: A, B, O, V, E -> but E is eliminated? So we cannot use E.

   So ABOUT is acceptable.

 Position 2:
  MAILS: M, A, I, L, S -> distinct, avoids C,R,N,E.
   TAILS: T, A, I, L, S -> distinct.

 Position 4:
   We don't have many words? How about ""FOCAL""? But FOCAL has C and L? C is eliminated. So no.
   ""LOCAL""? L, O, C, A, L -> C is eliminated? Yes, C is out. So no.

   ""VOCAL""? V, O, C, A, L -> C is eliminated? Yes.

   ""DATAL""? Not a word.

   How about ""STALE""? But E is eliminated.

   So it's hard to find words with A in position 4? 

   How about ""DIARY""? D, I, A, R, Y -> but R is eliminated? R is in the eliminated list.

   So avoid R.

 Position 5:
   Words ending with A? Like ""PIZZA""? But Z is not common. 
   ""AROMA""? But A is repeated? And we have R and M? R is eliminated.

   How about ""MANGA""? M, A, N, G, A -> N is eliminated? So no.

   ""TABLA""? T, A, B, L, A -> distinct? And avoids C,R,N,E? Yes.

 But TABLA has A in position 2 and 5? 

 Alternatively, we can try ""TABLA"" or ""MAILS"" or ""TAILS"".

 However, we have not tested S, T, L, etc. 

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

 How about ""SAULT""? Not a common word.

 Let me stick with ABOUT: A in position 1, and letters B, O, U, T.

 But note: we have already tested A? Actually, we haven't tested it in the context of the secret word, but we know A is present. So using A again in position 1 might be good? Because if it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it's in another position.

 However, we are trying to maximize new letters. ABOUT uses A, B, O, U, T. We know A is in the word, so we are testing B, O, U, T.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't repeat A? But we don't have to repeat A? We can leave it out? But we know A is in the word, so we should use it? Actually, we can choose not to use A? But then we wouldn't get information about other positions of A? 

 However, the rules: we must include A? No, we don't have to. But if we don't include A, we won't get information about the position of A. 

 But we have 5 tries left? Actually, we have used 1, so 5 left? But we are making the second guess.

 Since we know A is in the word, we should use it to try to find its correct position.

 So I think ABOUT is a good candidate.

 But let me check: ABOUT: A in position 1, B in position 2, O in 3, U in 4, T in 5.

 We know A is not in position 3? But we are putting it in position 1. So if the secret word has A in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it's in 2,4, or 5.

 Also, we are testing B, O, U, T.

 Alternatively, we can try ""AUDIO"" which is a common second guess? But AUDIO has A in position 1 and 4? And we are testing U, D, I, O. But we have two A's? 

 We don't know if the word has two A's? So AUDIO might be acceptable? But it repeats A.

 However, AUDIO: A in position 1 and 4. If the secret word has only one A, then the A in position 1 might be a minus and the A in position 4 might be an x? 

 But we are trying to get maximum information. ABOUT seems better because it uses distinct letters.

 Another word: ""ADIEU"" - but that has E and we know E is eliminated? So no.

 So between ABOUT and AUDIO, ABOUT seems better because it uses distinct letters and tests more consonants.

 But note: we have not tested S, T, L, etc. 

 Another candidate: ""SALET"" (a word in word lists) -> S, A, L, E, T -> but E is eliminated? So no.

 How about ""HASTY""? H, A, S, T, Y -> distinct, avoids C,R,N,E? Yes. And A is in position 2.

 HASTY: positions: H(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5)

 This tests H, A, S, T, Y. We know A is in the word, so we are testing H, S, T, Y.

 But note: we are testing A again? Actually, we are putting A in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it's in 1,4, or 5.

 Also, we are testing H, S, T, Y.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> distinct? Yes, but repeated A.

 PASTA: A in position 2 and 5.

 We are testing P, S, T, and A (twice). It might be less efficient? 

 I think ABOUT is a good choice.

 But let me see: we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E). The remaining letters are more or less common? 

 Common letters left: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, B, G, Y, etc.

 We can also consider ""BAILS"": B, A, I, L, S -> distinct, avoids C,R,N,E? Yes. A in position 2.

 BAILS: tests B, A, I, L, S.

 Now, comparing:
   ABOUT: tests A (position 1), B, O, U, T.
   BAILS: tests A (position 2), B, I, L, S.

 Which one? 

 We have not tested S, T, L, O, etc. 

 Both are valid. But ABOUT tests T and O? And BAILS tests L and S? 

 Since S and T are very common, ABOUT might be better? 

 However, we have to consider that the word might have S? 

 But we don't know. 

 Another word: ""TALON"" -> T, A, L, O, N -> but N is eliminated? So no.

 How about ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> tests P, S, T, and A (twice). It tests S and T? 

 But we have two A's? So we are testing two positions for A? 

 However, we are only testing 4 new letters? (since A is repeated). 

 I think ABOUT is better because it tests 5 new distinct letters? 

 But note: we are testing A again? Actually, we are testing it in a new position? 

 ABOUT: A in position 1, B in 2, O in 3, U in 4, T in 5.

 We know that A is not in position 3? So we are testing position 1 for A.

 If we get a check for A, then we know it's in position 1. If we get a minus, then A is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in 2,4, or 5.

 Also, we are testing B, O, U, T.

 So I'll go with ABOUT.

 But wait: what if the word has A in position 2? Then ABOUT will show A as not in position 1? And we'll know it's in 2? 

 However, we are testing A in position 1. If it's not there, then we know A is in 2,4, or 5.

 So let's decide on ABOUT.

 But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters. ABOUT is free of C, R, N, E.

 So I'll guess ""ABOUT"".

 However, let me double-check: 
   A: we know is in the word, but we are testing position 1.
   B, O, U, T: new letters.

 This seems good.

 So the second guess: ""ABOUT""

 But note: we are using O and U? We don't know if they are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4? 

 How about ""DELTA""? D, E, L, T, A -> but E is eliminated? So no.

 How about "" ALPHA""? A, L, P, H, A -> repeated A? And A in position 1 and 5? 

 But we are testing A again? And we are testing L, P, H.

 But we have two A's? 

 I think ABOUT is better.

 Another word: ""AMPLY""? A, M, P, L, Y -> distinct letters? Yes. And avoids C,R,N,E? Yes.

 AMPLY: A in position 1, M, P, L, Y.

 This tests M, P, L, Y and A (in position 1).

 This is also a candidate.

 Now, we have:
   ABOUT: tests A (pos1), B, O, U, T
   AMPLY: tests A (pos1), M, P, L, Y
   BAILS: tests A (pos2), B, I, L, S

 Which one? 

 We have not tested S, T, L, O, etc. 

 AMPLY tests M, P, L, Y? 

 But S and T are more common than M and Y? 

 However, we are testing A in the same position as before? In the first guess A was in position 3? Now we are putting it in position 1. 

 If we get a check for A, then we know it's in position 1. If not, we know it's in 2,4, or 5.

 I think ABOUT is a good choice.

 But let me see: we have eliminated R, N, E, C. 

 The most common letters left are S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, B, G, Y, F, etc.

 We can also consider ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T -> but no A? We must include A? Actually, we don't have to include A? But we know A is in the word, so if we don't include A, we won't get information about its position? 

 However, we are allowed to guess without A? But that might not be efficient. 

 Actually, we can use a word that doesn't have A? But then we are wasting a guess? Because we know A is in the word and we haven't tested it in other positions? 

 So we should include A.

 I think ABOUT is a solid choice.

 Let me write it: 

 Guess: A B O U T

 But note: we are testing A in position 1. If the secret word has A in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know A is in 2,4, or 5.

 Also, we are testing B, O, U, T.

 So I'll go with ""ABOUT"".

 However, we must ensure that ""ABOUT"" is a valid word? Yes, it is.

 Therefore, second guess: ""ABOUT""

 But wait: what if the word has A in position 2? Then ABOUT will show A as not in position 1? And we'll get a minus for A? Then we know A is in 2? 

 But we are not testing position 2? We are testing position 1. 

 Alternatively, we can test position 2? 

 How about ""SALAD""? S, A, L, A, D -> repeated A? And A in position 2 and 4? 

 But we are testing S, A, L, D. And we are testing A in two positions? 

 But we have only 5 distinct letters? 

 I think ABOUT is better.

 Final decision: ""ABOUT""

<guess>about</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **avoid position 3**.
- Must **exclude C, R, N, E**.
- Should prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **S, T, L, O, B**) to gather more information.

The word **ABOUT** fits these criteria:
- Places **A in position 1** (a new position to test).
- Tests new common letters: **B, O, U, T**.
- Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, E) and repeated letters.
- Is a valid English word.

This guess will help identify the position of **A** and test four new letters.",Guess 2: about -> FEEDBACK: A(-) B(✓) O(-) U(x) T(x),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 07 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, from this we know:
 - The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the third position of ""crane"" and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
 - The letters C, R, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the third position. Also, it does not contain C, R, N, E.

 Since we have 6 tries, we need to make a second guess that is a 5-letter word.

 We must choose a word that:
 1. Includes the letter A (because we know it's in the word) but not in the third position.
 2. Does not contain C, R, N, E.
 3. Should try to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that are still possible. We have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E). The remaining consonants and vowels are important.

 We know the word has an A. Since A is not in position 3, it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 We should try to use a word that has A in a different position and includes other common letters that we haven't tested yet.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C, R, N, E) might include: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 We also note that the word must have 5 distinct letters? Actually, not necessarily. But for maximum information, we might prefer distinct letters.

 Let's try to form a word that has A and other common letters, and avoid the eliminated ones.

 Possible words: 
   We can try words with A in the first position? But note: we don't know if A is in position 1 or not. We only know it's not in position 3.

 Example: ""AUDIO"" - but that has A in position 1 and 4? And we haven't tested U, D, I, O. But note: we have eliminated E, so AUDIO is acceptable? Let's check: A, U, D, I, O. None of these are in the eliminated set (C, R, N, E). So that's a candidate.

 However, we might also consider words that have A in other positions.

 Another common word: ""PLAIT"" - but that has A in position 3? But wait, we know A is not in position 3? Actually, no: the feedback for A was '-' meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot put A in position 3 again.

 Therefore, in ""PLAIT"", if we put A in position 3, that would be the same position that we already know is wrong. So we should avoid that.

 Let's try to put A in a new position. Since it was in position 3 and was wrong, we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 Another idea: ""SALAD"" - but that has two A's? And we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we have eliminated R, N, E, so S, A, L, D are acceptable? But SALAD has A in position 2 and 4. However, we don't know if the word has two A's. It might.

 But note: we have only one A confirmed so far? Actually, the feedback for A was one '-' meaning at least one A is present. It could have more.

 However, we want to maximize new information. So using two A's might not be efficient? But it could be.

 Alternatively, we can try a word with A in position 1: ""ABOUT""
 But ABOUT has B, O, U, T. And A in position 1.

 However, we don't know if B, O, U, T are in the word. So ABOUT is a valid guess? But note: we have eliminated R, N, E, but B, O, U, T are new.

 But wait: we have to avoid the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E. So ABOUT is acceptable.

 Another candidate: ""PLAIT"" is not good because A is in position 3 (which we know is wrong). So avoid position 3 for A.

 How about ""PAINT""? But PAINT has N? We have eliminated N. So no.

 How about ""MAILS""? 
 M, A, I, L, S. 
 A is in position 2? 
 And we avoid the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E.

 SoMAILS is a candidate.

 Another: ""TAILS""? T, A, I, L, S. A in position 2? 

 But note: we don't know if T, I, L, S are in the word.

 However, we have two candidates: ABOUT andMAILS andTAILS.

 But we want to cover more common letters? 

 Let me think: we have already tested A, and we know it's in the word. We have tested C, R, N, E and they are out.

 Now, we can try to test other vowels? We have not tested I, O, U. 

 Also, we have not tested S, T, L, D, etc.

 ABOUT: A, B, O, U, T -> tests B, O, U, T (and A in a new position)
 MAILS: M, A, I, L, S -> tests M, I, L, S (and A in position 2)

 TAILS: T, A, I, L, S -> tests T, I, L, S (and A in position 2)

 Which one is better? 

 We might prefer about because it tests U and O? 

 But note: we have only 5 positions. We can test more vowels? 

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4 or 5? 

 Example: ""SPAIL"" - but that's not a common word? And we don't know if S, P, A, I, L are in the word. But SPAIL is not standard.

 How about ""STAMP""? But that has A in position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A.

 So we cannot use STAMP.

 How about ""PASTA""? 
 P, A, S, T, A -> but two A's? And A is in position 2 and 5? 
 But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we are repeating A in position 2 and 5? 

 However, PASTA is a valid word.

 But let's avoid repeating A for now? Because if the word has only one A, then we might get confusing feedback? 

 Actually, if the word has one A, then in PASTA the A in position 2 would be correct? But wait, we don't know the position of A.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a new position and uses distinct letters.

 Let me list some words that have A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 and avoid C, R, N, E:

 Position 1: 
   ABOUT: A, B, O, U, T -> distinct letters, avoids C,R,N,E.
   ABOVE: A, B, O, V, E -> but E is eliminated? So we cannot use E.

   So ABOUT is acceptable.

 Position 2:
  MAILS: M, A, I, L, S -> distinct, avoids C,R,N,E.
   TAILS: T, A, I, L, S -> distinct.

 Position 4:
   We don't have many words? How about ""FOCAL""? But FOCAL has C and L? C is eliminated. So no.
   ""LOCAL""? L, O, C, A, L -> C is eliminated? Yes, C is out. So no.

   ""VOCAL""? V, O, C, A, L -> C is eliminated? Yes.

   ""DATAL""? Not a word.

   How about ""STALE""? But E is eliminated.

   So it's hard to find words with A in position 4? 

   How about ""DIARY""? D, I, A, R, Y -> but R is eliminated? R is in the eliminated list.

   So avoid R.

 Position 5:
   Words ending with A? Like ""PIZZA""? But Z is not common. 
   ""AROMA""? But A is repeated? And we have R and M? R is eliminated.

   How about ""MANGA""? M, A, N, G, A -> N is eliminated? So no.

   ""TABLA""? T, A, B, L, A -> distinct? And avoids C,R,N,E? Yes.

 But TABLA has A in position 2 and 5? 

 Alternatively, we can try ""TABLA"" or ""MAILS"" or ""TAILS"".

 However, we have not tested S, T, L, etc. 

 Another word: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

 How about ""SAULT""? Not a common word.

 Let me stick with ABOUT: A in position 1, and letters B, O, U, T.

 But note: we have already tested A? Actually, we haven't tested it in the context of the secret word, but we know A is present. So using A again in position 1 might be good? Because if it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it's in another position.

 However, we are trying to maximize new letters. ABOUT uses A, B, O, U, T. We know A is in the word, so we are testing B, O, U, T.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't repeat A? But we don't have to repeat A? We can leave it out? But we know A is in the word, so we should use it? Actually, we can choose not to use A? But then we wouldn't get information about other positions of A? 

 However, the rules: we must include A? No, we don't have to. But if we don't include A, we won't get information about the position of A. 

 But we have 5 tries left? Actually, we have used 1, so 5 left? But we are making the second guess.

 Since we know A is in the word, we should use it to try to find its correct position.

 So I think ABOUT is a good candidate.

 But let me check: ABOUT: A in position 1, B in position 2, O in 3, U in 4, T in 5.

 We know A is not in position 3? But we are putting it in position 1. So if the secret word has A in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it's in 2,4, or 5.

 Also, we are testing B, O, U, T.

 Alternatively, we can try ""AUDIO"" which is a common second guess? But AUDIO has A in position 1 and 4? And we are testing U, D, I, O. But we have two A's? 

 We don't know if the word has two A's? So AUDIO might be acceptable? But it repeats A.

 However, AUDIO: A in position 1 and 4. If the secret word has only one A, then the A in position 1 might be a minus and the A in position 4 might be an x? 

 But we are trying to get maximum information. ABOUT seems better because it uses distinct letters.

 Another word: ""ADIEU"" - but that has E and we know E is eliminated? So no.

 So between ABOUT and AUDIO, ABOUT seems better because it uses distinct letters and tests more consonants.

 But note: we have not tested S, T, L, etc. 

 Another candidate: ""SALET"" (a word in word lists) -> S, A, L, E, T -> but E is eliminated? So no.

 How about ""HASTY""? H, A, S, T, Y -> distinct, avoids C,R,N,E? Yes. And A is in position 2.

 HASTY: positions: H(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5)

 This tests H, A, S, T, Y. We know A is in the word, so we are testing H, S, T, Y.

 But note: we are testing A again? Actually, we are putting A in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it's in 1,4, or 5.

 Also, we are testing H, S, T, Y.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> distinct? Yes, but repeated A.

 PASTA: A in position 2 and 5.

 We are testing P, S, T, and A (twice). It might be less efficient? 

 I think ABOUT is a good choice.

 But let me see: we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E). The remaining letters are more or less common? 

 Common letters left: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, B, G, Y, etc.

 We can also consider ""BAILS"": B, A, I, L, S -> distinct, avoids C,R,N,E? Yes. A in position 2.

 BAILS: tests B, A, I, L, S.

 Now, comparing:
   ABOUT: tests A (position 1), B, O, U, T.
   BAILS: tests A (position 2), B, I, L, S.

 Which one? 

 We have not tested S, T, L, O, etc. 

 Both are valid. But ABOUT tests T and O? And BAILS tests L and S? 

 Since S and T are very common, ABOUT might be better? 

 However, we have to consider that the word might have S? 

 But we don't know. 

 Another word: ""TALON"" -> T, A, L, O, N -> but N is eliminated? So no.

 How about ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> tests P, S, T, and A (twice). It tests S and T? 

 But we have two A's? So we are testing two positions for A? 

 However, we are only testing 4 new letters? (since A is repeated). 

 I think ABOUT is better because it tests 5 new distinct letters? 

 But note: we are testing A again? Actually, we are testing it in a new position? 

 ABOUT: A in position 1, B in 2, O in 3, U in 4, T in 5.

 We know that A is not in position 3? So we are testing position 1 for A.

 If we get a check for A, then we know it's in position 1. If we get a minus, then A is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in 2,4, or 5.

 Also, we are testing B, O, U, T.

 So I'll go with ABOUT.

 But wait: what if the word has A in position 2? Then ABOUT will show A as not in position 1? And we'll know it's in 2? 

 However, we are testing A in position 1. If it's not there, then we know A is in 2,4, or 5.

 So let's decide on ABOUT.

 But note: we have to avoid the eliminated letters. ABOUT is free of C, R, N, E.

 So I'll guess ""ABOUT"".

 However, let me double-check: 
   A: we know is in the word, but we are testing position 1.
   B, O, U, T: new letters.

 This seems good.

 So the second guess: ""ABOUT""

 But note: we are using O and U? We don't know if they are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4? 

 How about ""DELTA""? D, E, L, T, A -> but E is eliminated? So no.

 How about "" ALPHA""? A, L, P, H, A -> repeated A? And A in position 1 and 5? 

 But we are testing A again? And we are testing L, P, H.

 But we have two A's? 

 I think ABOUT is better.

 Another word: ""AMPLY""? A, M, P, L, Y -> distinct letters? Yes. And avoids C,R,N,E? Yes.

 AMPLY: A in position 1, M, P, L, Y.

 This tests M, P, L, Y and A (in position 1).

 This is also a candidate.

 Now, we have:
   ABOUT: tests A (pos1), B, O, U, T
   AMPLY: tests A (pos1), M, P, L, Y
   BAILS: tests A (pos2), B, I, L, S

 Which one? 

 We have not tested S, T, L, O, etc. 

 AMPLY tests M, P, L, Y? 

 But S and T are more common than M and Y? 

 However, we are testing A in the same position as before? In the first guess A was in position 3? Now we are putting it in position 1. 

 If we get a check for A, then we know it's in position 1. If not, we know it's in 2,4, or 5.

 I think ABOUT is a good choice.

 But let me see: we have eliminated R, N, E, C. 

 The most common letters left are S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, B, G, Y, F, etc.

 We can also consider ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T -> but no A? We must include A? Actually, we don't have to include A? But we know A is in the word, so if we don't include A, we won't get information about its position? 

 However, we are allowed to guess without A? But that might not be efficient. 

 Actually, we can use a word that doesn't have A? But then we are wasting a guess? Because we know A is in the word and we haven't tested it in other positions? 

 So we should include A.

 I think ABOUT is a solid choice.

 Let me write it: 

 Guess: A B O U T

 But note: we are testing A in position 1. If the secret word has A in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know A is in 2,4, or 5.

 Also, we are testing B, O, U, T.

 So I'll go with ""ABOUT"".

 However, we must ensure that ""ABOUT"" is a valid word? Yes, it is.

 Therefore, second guess: ""ABOUT""

 But wait: what if the word has A in position 2? Then ABOUT will show A as not in position 1? And we'll get a minus for A? Then we know A is in 2? 

 But we are not testing position 2? We are testing position 1. 

 Alternatively, we can test position 2? 

 How about ""SALAD""? S, A, L, A, D -> repeated A? And A in position 2 and 4? 

 But we are testing S, A, L, D. And we are testing A in two positions? 

 But we have only 5 distinct letters? 

 I think ABOUT is better.

 Final decision: ""ABOUT""

<guess>about</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, R, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** (since it's confirmed in the word) but **avoid position 3**.
- Must **exclude C, R, N, E**.
- Should prioritize testing new common letters (e.g., **S, T, L, O, B**) to gather more information.

The word **ABOUT** fits these criteria:
- Places **A in position 1** (a new position to test).
- Tests new common letters: **B, O, U, T**.
- Avoids eliminated letters (C, R, N, E) and repeated letters.
- Is a valid English word.

This guess will help identify the position of **A** and test four new letters.

But for maximum information, we might prefer distinct letters.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that has A and other common letters, and avoid the eliminated ones.\n\n Possible words: \n   We can try words with A in the first position? But note: we don\'t know if A is in position 1 or not. We only know it\'s not in position 3.\n\n Example: ""AUDIO"" - but that has A in position 1 and 4? And we haven\'t tested U, D, I, O. But note: we have eliminated E, so AUDIO is acceptable? Let\'s check: A, U, D, I, O. None of these are in the eliminated set (C, R, N, E). So that\'s a candidate.\n\n However, we might also consider words that have A in other positions.\n\n Another common word: ""PLAIT"" - but that has A in position 3? But wait, we know A is not in position 3? Actually, no: the feedback for A was \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot put A in position 3 again.\n\n Therefore, in ""PLAIT"", if we put A in position 3, that would be the same position that we already know is wrong. So we should avoid that.\n\n Let\'s try to put A in a new position. Since it was in position 3 and was wrong, we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n Another idea: ""SALAD"" - but that has two A\'s? And we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, we have eliminated R, N, E, so S, A, L, D are acceptable? But SALAD has A in position 2 and 4. However, we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. It might.\n\n But note: we have only one A confirmed so far? Actually, the feedback for A was one \'-\' meaning at least one A is present. It could have more.\n\n However, we want to maximize new information. So using two A\'s might not be efficient? But it could be.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word with A in position 1: ""ABOUT""\n But ABOUT has B, O, U, T. And A in position 1.\n\n However, we don\'t know if B, O, U, T are in the word. So ABOUT is a valid guess? But note: we have eliminated R, N, E, but B, O, U, T are new.\n\n But wait: we have to avoid the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E. So ABOUT is acceptable.\n\n Another candidate: ""PLAIT"" is not good because A is in position 3 (which we know is wrong). So avoid position 3 for A.\n\n How about ""PAINT""? But PAINT has N? We have eliminated N. So no.\n\n How about ""MAILS""? \n M, A, I, L, S. \n A is in position 2? \n And we avoid the eliminated letters: C, R, N, E.\n\n SoMAILS is a candidate.\n\n Another: ""TAILS""? T, A, I, L, S. A in position 2? \n\n But note: we don\'t know if T, I, L, S are in the word.\n\n However, we have two candidates: ABOUT andMAILS andTAILS.\n\n But we want to cover more common letters? \n\n Let me think: we have already tested A, and we know it\'s in the word. We have tested C, R, N, E and they are out.\n\n Now, we can try to test other vowels? We have not tested I, O, U. \n\n Also, we have not tested S, T, L, D, etc.\n\n ABOUT: A, B, O, U, T -> tests B, O, U, T (and A in a new position)\n MAILS: M, A, I, L, S -> tests M, I, L, S (and A in position 2)\n\n TAILS: T, A, I, L, S -> tests T, I, L, S (and A in position 2)\n\n Which one is better? \n\n We might prefer about because it tests U and O? \n\n But note: we have only 5 positions. We can test more vowels? \n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 4 or 5? \n\n Example: ""SPAIL"" - but that\'s not a common word? And we don\'t know if S, P, A, I, L are in the word. But SPAIL is not standard.\n\n How about ""STAMP""? But that has A in position 3? We must avoid position 3 for A.\n\n So we cannot use STAMP.\n\n How about ""PASTA""? \n P, A, S, T, A -> but two A\'s? And A is in position 2 and 5? \n But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, we are repeating A in position 2 and 5? \n\n However, PASTA is a valid word.\n\n But let\'s avoid repeating A for now? Because if the word has only one A, then we might get confusing feedback? \n\n Actually, if the word has one A, then in PASTA the A in position 2 would be correct? But wait, we don\'t know the position of A.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in a new position and uses distinct letters.\n\n Let me list some words that have A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 and avoid C, R, N, E:\n\n Position 1: \n   ABOUT: A, B, O, U, T -> distinct letters, avoids C,R,N,E.\n   ABOVE: A, B, O, V, E -> but E is eliminated? So we cannot use E.\n\n   So ABOUT is acceptable.\n\n Position 2:\n  MAILS: M, A, I, L, S -> distinct, avoids C,R,N,E.\n   TAILS: T, A, I, L, S -> distinct.\n\n Position 4:\n   We don\'t have many words? How about ""FOCAL""? But FOCAL has C and L? C is eliminated. So no.\n   ""LOCAL""? L, O, C, A, L -> C is eliminated? Yes, C is out. So no.\n\n   ""VOCAL""? V, O, C, A, L -> C is eliminated? Yes.\n\n   ""DATAL""? Not a word.\n\n   How about ""STALE""? But E is eliminated.\n\n   So it\'s hard to find words with A in position 4? \n\n   How about ""DIARY""? D, I, A, R, Y -> but R is eliminated? R is in the eliminated list.\n\n   So avoid R.\n\n Position 5:\n   Words ending with A? Like ""PIZZA""? But Z is not common. \n   ""AROMA""? But A is repeated? And we have R and M? R is eliminated.\n\n   How about ""MANGA""? M, A, N, G, A -> N is eliminated? So no.\n\n   ""TABLA""? T, A, B, L, A -> distinct? And avoids C,R,N,E? Yes.\n\n But TABLA has A in position 2 and 5? \n\n Alternatively, we can try ""TABLA"" or ""MAILS"" or ""TAILS"".\n\n However, we have not tested S, T, L, etc. \n\n Another word: ""PLAIT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.\n\n How about ""SAULT""? Not a common word.\n\n Let me stick with ABOUT: A in position 1, and letters B, O, U, T.\n\n But note: we have already tested A? Actually, we haven\'t tested it in the context of the secret word, but we know A is present. So using A again in position 1 might be good? Because if it\'s correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it\'s in another position.\n\n However, we are trying to maximize new letters. ABOUT uses A, B, O, U, T. We know A is in the word, so we are testing B, O, U, T.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t repeat A? But we don\'t have to repeat A? We can leave it out? But we know A is in the word, so we should use it? Actually, we can choose not to use A? But then we wouldn\'t get information about other positions of A? \n\n However, the rules: we must include A? No, we don\'t have to. But if we don\'t include A, we won\'t get information about the position of A. \n\n But we have 5 tries left? Actually, we have used 1, so 5 left? But we are making the second guess.\n\n Since we know A is in the word, we should use it to try to find its correct position.\n\n So I think ABOUT is a good candidate.\n\n But let me check: ABOUT: A in position 1, B in position 2, O in 3, U in 4, T in 5.\n\n We know A is not in position 3? But we are putting it in position 1. So if the secret word has A in position 1, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it\'s in 2,4, or 5.\n\n Also, we are testing B, O, U, T.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""AUDIO"" which is a common second guess? But AUDIO has A in position 1 and 4? And we are testing U, D, I, O. But we have two A\'s? \n\n We don\'t know if the word has two A\'s? So AUDIO might be acceptable? But it repeats A.\n\n However, AUDIO: A in position 1 and 4. If the secret word has only one A, then the A in position 1 might be a minus and the A in position 4 might be an x? \n\n But we are trying to get maximum information. ABOUT seems better because it uses distinct letters.\n\n Another word: ""ADIEU"" - but that has E and we know E is eliminated? So no.\n\n So between ABOUT and AUDIO, ABOUT seems better because it uses distinct letters and tests more consonants.\n\n But note: we have not tested S, T, L, etc. \n\n Another candidate: ""SALET"" (a word in word lists) -> S, A, L, E, T -> but E is eliminated? So no.\n\n How about ""HASTY""? H, A, S, T, Y -> distinct, avoids C,R,N,E? Yes. And A is in position 2.\n\n HASTY: positions: H(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5)\n\n This tests H, A, S, T, Y. We know A is in the word, so we are testing H, S, T, Y.\n\n But note: we are testing A again? Actually, we are putting A in position 2. If the secret word has A in position 2, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it\'s in 1,4, or 5.\n\n Also, we are testing H, S, T, Y.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> distinct? Yes, but repeated A.\n\n PASTA: A in position 2 and 5.\n\n We are testing P, S, T, and A (twice). It might be less efficient? \n\n I think ABOUT is a good choice.\n\n But let me see: we have eliminated 4 letters (C, R, N, E). The remaining letters are more or less common? \n\n Common letters left: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, M, P, B, G, Y, etc.\n\n We can also consider ""BAILS"": B, A, I, L, S -> distinct, avoids C,R,N,E? Yes. A in position 2.\n\n BAILS: tests B, A, I, L, S.\n\n Now, comparing:\n   ABOUT: tests A (position 1), B, O, U, T.\n   BAILS: tests A (position 2), B, I, L, S.\n\n Which one? \n\n We have not tested S, T, L, O, etc. \n\n Both are valid. But ABOUT tests T and O?

So no.\n\n How about ""PASTA"": P, A, S, T, A -> tests P, S, T, and A (twice). It tests S and T? \n\n But we have two A\'s? So we are testing two positions for A? \n\n However, we are only testing 4 new letters? (since A is repeated). \n\n I think ABOUT is better because it tests 5 new distinct letters? \n\n But note: we are testing A again? Actually, we are testing it in a new position? \n\n ABOUT: A in position 1, B in 2, O in 3, U in 4, T in 5.\n\n We know that A is not in position 3? So we are testing position 1 for A.\n\n If we get a check for A, then we know it\'s in position 1. If we get a minus, then A is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in 2,4, or 5.\n\n Also, we are testing B, O, U, T.\n\n So I\'ll go with ABOUT.\n\n But wait: what if the word has A in position 2?

Yes.\n\n AMPLY: A in position 1, M, P, L, Y.\n\n This tests M, P, L, Y and A (in position 1).\n\n This is also a candidate.\n\n Now, we have:\n   ABOUT: tests A (pos1), B, O, U, T\n   AMPLY: tests A (pos1), M, P, L, Y\n   BAILS: tests A (pos2), B, I, L, S\n\n Which one? \n\n We have not tested S, T, L, O, etc. \n\n AMPLY tests M, P, L, Y? \n\n But S and T are more common than M and Y? \n\n However, we are testing A in the same position as before?

If the secret word has A in position 1, we get a check.

Yes, it is.\n\n Therefore, second guess: ""ABOUT""\n\n But wait: what if the word has A in position 2? Then ABOUT will show A as not in position 1? And we\'ll get a minus for A?

We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Second guess: ""about""
- A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word but not in position 1 (from about) and not in position 3 (from crane)
- B: ✓ (correct position, so B is the second letter of the secret word)
- O: - (in word, wrong position) -> O is in the word but not in position 3 (from about) and not in position 4? Actually, from ""about"", O was in position 3? Let me check: 
  In ""about"": 
    Position 1: A -> -
    Position 2: B -> ✓
    Position 3: O -> - (so O is in the word but not in position 3)
    Position 4: U -> x
    Position 5: T -> x

So O is in the word, but not in position 3. And we already knew from the first guess that A was not in position 3.

Now, we know:
- The secret word has the letter B in position 2.
- The secret word has the letter A, but not in position 1 (from about) and not in position 3 (from crane). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5? But wait, we have position 2 taken by B? So A cannot be in position 2? Because B is fixed at position 2? 

Actually, from the second guess: B is in position 2 and correct. So the secret word has B as the second letter. Therefore, the position 2 is fixed as B.

Now, A is in the word but not in position 1 (from about) and not in position 3 (from crane). Since position 2 is B, A must be in position 4 or 5? 

Also, we have:
- From crane: A was in position 3 and got '-', so not position 3.
- From about: A was in position 1 and got '-', so not position 1.
- Position 2 is B, so A must be in 4 or 5.

Additionally, we know:
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, N, E, U, T (from the x's in both guesses).
- The secret word contains A and B (and whatever else we haven't tested).

We also know from the first guess that A was present, and from the second guess that A is still present (but in a different position).

Now, let's list the knowns:
- Position 2: B (fixed)
- A is in the word, in position 4 or 5.

We need to find a word that:
- Has B as the second letter.
- Has A in either position 4 or 5.
- Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, U, T (and any others we haven't seen? We haven't tested many, but these are eliminated).
- Uses new letters to test.

We have eliminated: C, R, N, E, U, T.

Remaining letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we know the word must have A (in position 4 or 5) and B (in position 2).

We need to test:
- Position 4: is A there? If we put A in position 4, we might get a check or a minus.
- Position 5: similarly.

But we can also test other letters.

We have 4 guesses left? Actually, we have used 2, so 4 left? But we are making the third guess.

We can try to test both possibilities? But we can only test one at a time.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 4 and then test it? Or in position 5?

But we don't know which one. So we can choose a word that has A in position 4 and see the feedback? 

But note: if we put A in position 4 and it's actually in position 5, we'll get a minus? And if we put it in position 5 and it's actually in 4, we'll get a minus? 

But we can also test a word that has A in one of the positions and also tests other common letters.

We must include A? Actually, we don't have to, but we know A is in the word so we should use it to avoid wasting a guess? 

But if we don't include A, we might get information about other letters? But we know A is in the word, so we should use it to try to locate it.

So let's try to form a word that has:
- Position 2: B (fixed)
- A in position 4? Or position 5?

We can try position 4 for A.

But we also want to test other common letters.

Example: ""B"" is fixed at position 2, so we need a word of the form: _ B _ _ _

With A in position 4: ? B ? A ?

Or A in position 5: ? B ? ? A

We also need to avoid the eliminated letters.

Let's try A in position 4.

Possible words:
- ""ABYSS"" -> but has S repeated? And Y, S. But also, we have eliminated S? No, we haven't eliminated S. But ABYSS has two S's? And A in position 1? But we are putting A in position 4? 

Wait, in ""ABYSS"": 
  Position 1: A -> but we know A is not in position 1? From the second guess, about put A in position 1 and got a minus? So A is not in position 1. So we cannot put A in position 1.

So we must have a letter in position 1 that is not A and not eliminated.

How about ""LABOR""? But R is eliminated? So no.

""LIBRA""? L, I, B, R, A -> R is eliminated? So no.

""OBIT""? Not a word.

""OBIAS""? O, B, I, A, S -> but O is in position 1? And we are putting A in position 4? 
  Positions: 
    1: O
    2: B (fixed)
    3: I
    4: A
    5: S

But we don't know if O, I, S are in the word? And we are testing A in position 4.

But the word ""OBIAS"" is valid? Yes.

But note: we have eliminated R, N, E, U, T, but O, I, S are new.

But wait: we have to avoid using too many vowels? We have only tested A and O? 

But we don't know about O? 

However, we have a problem: we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 4 or 5. So by putting A in position 4, we can test if it's in 4.

But we can also test other letters.

Another candidate: ""ABYSM"" - not a common word.

""KBAAS""? Not a word.

""LABDA""? Not a word.

How about ""LABIA""? L, A, B, I, A -> repeated A? And A in position 2 and 5? But position 2 is B? So we cannot have A in position 2. So LABia has A in position 2 and 5? But position 2 must be B? So no.

We must have B in position 2.

So let's think of words with B in position 2 and A in position 4.

Examples:
- ""ABYSS"" -> but A is in position 1? Not allowed. 
- ""OBIAS"" -> O, B, I, A, S -> positions: 1:O, 2:B, 3:I, 4:A, 5:S -> valid.

But OBIAS has A in position 4.

Another: ""ABACU"" -> but C is eliminated? And U is eliminated? So no.

""LIBEL""? L, I, B, E, L -> E is eliminated? So no.

""OBIES""? O, B, I, E, S -> E is eliminated? So no.

""ABIDE""? A, B, I, D, E -> E is eliminated? So no.

""ABIDE"" has E? Eliminated.

How about ""ABHOR""? A, B, H, O, R -> R is eliminated? So no.

""ABYSS"" is invalid because A is in position 1.

""OBAS""? Not 5 letters.

""OBBY""? Not a word.

""ABBOT""? A, B, B, O, T -> T is eliminated? And repeated B? So no.

""ABBOT"" has T? Eliminated.

So ""OBIAS"" seems a candidate: O, B, I, A, S -> with B in 2, A in 4.

But we have to check if it's valid: yes, it's a word (biasis).

But note: we are testing A in position 4. If the secret word has A in position 5, then we'll get a minus for A? And we'll know A is in 5.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 5.

For example: ""ABYSM"" -> not common.

""KBAAS"" -> not a word.

""LABRA""? R eliminated.

""LABDA"" -> not a word.

""ABOVE""? V and E? E is eliminated.

""ABUSE""? U and E eliminated.

It's hard to find words with A in position 5 and B in position 2.

How about ""OBAS""? Not 5 letters.

""OBBY"" -> not a word.

""ABBY"" -> not 5 letters? And has B repeated? 

Actually, ""ABBY"" is 5 letters? A-B-B-Y. But repeated B? And Y.

But we don't know if the word has repeated letters? 

But let's avoid repeats for now? 

Another word: ""ABACU"" -> C and U eliminated.

So perhaps ""OBIAS"" is a good choice.

But we have to consider: we are testing A in position 4. If we get a check for A, then we know A is in position 4. If we get a minus, then A must be in position 5 (since it's the only other option).

But we are also testing O, I, S.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 5? 

For example: ""OBIT""? Not a word.

""ABOIL""? Not a word.

""ABOMA""? But O in position 3? And A in position 5? 
  Positions: 
    1: A -> but we know A is not in position 1? From the second guess: about put A in position 1 and got a minus? So A is not in 1. So we cannot put A in 1.

""ABOMA"" has A in 1? Not allowed.

How about ""ABYSS"" -> A in 1? Not allowed.

So it's difficult to find a word with A in position 5 and B in position 2.

Another idea: ""KBAAS""? Not a word.

""LABIA"" -> L, A, B, I, A -> A in position 2 and 5? But position 2 must be B? So no.

We must have B in position 2.

So let's list words with B in position 2 and A in position 4 or 5.

Position 4: 
  The pattern is: _ B _ A _

We need a word: 
  First letter: not eliminated (so not C,R,N,E,U,T)
  Last two letters: not eliminated and not A? (unless repeated A? but we don't know) and not the eliminated ones.

Examples:
- ""ABBAY""? Not a word? 
- ""ABBAK""? Not a word.
- ""ABBAZ""? No.

Common words: 
- ""LABIA"" -> but pattern: L, A, B, I, A -> so position 2 is A? But we need B in position 2? So no.

Wait, no: the pattern is fixed: position 2 is B.

So for position 4: 
  Words: 
    ""ABBEY""? A, B, B, E, Y -> E eliminated? And repeated B? 
    ""ABBOT""? A, B, B, O, T -> T eliminated? 
    ""ABBY""? Not 5 letters? 
    ""ABBS""? Not a word? 
    ""ABUDS""? Not a word.

It's hard to find.

Perhaps A in position 5 is more promising?

Pattern: _ B _ _ A

Words:
- ""ABBS""? Not a word.
- ""ABOIL""? Not a word.
- ""ABOMA""? A in 1? Not allowed.
- ""ABOVE""? E eliminated.
- ""ABUSE""? U and E eliminated.
- ""ABYSS""? A in 1? Not allowed.

How about ""OBBA""? Not 5 letters.

""OBBE""? Not a word.

""ABBEY""? A in 1? Not allowed.

So maybe A in position 4 is more feasible? 

But we have ""OBIAS"": O, B, I, A, S -> 
  Position 1: O
  Position 2: B (fixed)
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: A
  Position 5: S

This avoids the eliminated letters? 
Eliminated: C, R, N, E, U, T -> none of these are in ""OBIAS"".

So ""OBIAS"" is a valid guess.

But what if the secret word has A in position 5? Then in ""OBIAS"", the A is in position 4? So we'll get a minus for A? And then we know A must be in 5? 

But we are also testing O, I, S.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 5? 

For example: ""OBIT""? Not a word.

""ABOON""? A in 1? Not allowed.

""ABOO""? A in 1? Not allowed.

""ABUZZ""? A in 1? Not allowed.

It's very hard to find a word with A in position 5 and B in position 2.

Another word: ""ABYSA""? Not a word.

""ABYSM""? Not common.

So perhaps A in position 4 is the best we can do? 

But we have another candidate: ""ABHOR""? But R eliminated.

How about ""ABHIL""? Not a word.

""ABIDE""? E eliminated.

So ""OBIAS"" seems a good choice.

But note: we are testing A in position 4. If we get a check, then we know A is in 4. If we get a minus, then A must be in 5.

Also, we are testing O, I, S.

We have not tested O, I, S before? Yes.

So let's go with ""OBIAS"".

But wait: what if the word has A in position 5? Then in ""OBIAS"", the A in position 4 will be a minus? And we'll know A is in 5? 

But we are also testing S at the end? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 5? But we can't find one easily.

Another word: ""ABYSM"" is not common, but let's check: A-B-Y-S-M -> A in position 1? Not allowed.

How about ""BBAS""? Not 5 letters.

I think ""OBIAS"" is a reasonable choice.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any indication so far.

So I'll guess ""OBIAS"".

But let me confirm: 
  O: new
  B: we know is in position 2 (so we expect a check? But we are putting it in position 2? It is fixed, so we should get a check? Actually, we know B is in position 2, so we must put B in position 2? 

In ""OBIAS"", we are putting:
  Position 1: O
  Position 2: B (fixed, so we know it will be a check)
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: A
  Position 5: S

We are testing:
  O in position 1: if it's in the word? and if so, is it in position 1?
  I in position 3: testing I? 
  S in position 5: testing S.

And A in position 4: if it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and then we know A must be in position 5.

So we are effectively testing two possibilities: 
  - If A is in position 4, we get a check for A? Then we know the pattern: ? B ? A ?
  - If we get a minus for A, then A must be in position 5.

So we can get information regardless.

But we are also testing O, I, S.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 5? But we can't find one easily.

Another word: ""ABYSM"" is not valid? 

How about ""ABYSS""? A in 1? Not allowed.

So I think ""OBIAS"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word with A in position 5: 

  ""ABOON"" -> A in 1? Not allowed.

  ""ABUZZ"" -> A in 1? Not allowed.

  ""ABYSS"" -> A in 1? Not allowed.

  ""ABBBY"" -> A in 1? Not allowed.

  ""ABBY"" -> not 5 letters.

So I think ""OBIAS"" is the best we can do.

But note: we have not tested D, G, H, L, M, P, etc.

We can try ""OBIAS"" or we can try ""LABIA""? But LABia has A in position 2? Not allowed.

Another word: ""ABYSM"" -> A in 1? Not allowed.

How about ""BBAL""? Not 5 letters.

I think we have to go with ""OBIAS"".

But wait: what about ""ABYSM""? It's not common, but let's consider: A-B-Y-S-M -> A in position 1? Not allowed.

So no.

Perhaps ""ABHOR"" -> R eliminated.

I found: ""ABOON"" is a word? It means something? But A in 1? Not allowed.

So let's go with ""OBIAS"".

But note: we are testing A in position 4. If it's not there, then A must be in 5.

And we are testing O, I, S.

So I'll guess ""OBIAS"".

But let me write it: O B I A S

So:

Guess: O B I A S

But wait: we are putting A in position 4. If the secret word has A in position 5, then we'll get a minus for A? And we'll know A is in 5.

Similarly, if we get a check for A in position 4, then we know it's in 4.

But we are also testing O, I, S.

So this is good.

But what if the secret word has A in position 4? Then we get a check for A.

If not, then A must be in 5.

Also, we are testing O in position 1, I in position 3, S in position 5.

Now, we have to avoid the eliminated letters: we are using O, B, I, A, S. B is fixed, so we are testing O, I, S, and A (position).

So let's do that.

But note: we are using S at the end? 

Another candidate: ""ABYSS"" is invalid.

So I think ""OBIAS"" is a valid choice.

Therefore, third guess: ""OBIAS""

But let me double-check: 
  Pattern: _ B _ _ _
  We are testing: O in 1, B in 2 (fixed, so we know it will be ✓), I in 3, A in 4, S in 5.

  If A is in position 4, we get ✓ for A? 
  If A is in position 5, we get - for A? (because it's in the word but not in 4) and then we know A is in 5.

  And we test O, I, S.

  So we get information about O, I, S and the position of A.

  Also, we avoid the eliminated letters.

  So I'll go with ""OBIAS"".

But note: we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""obias"" is a valid English word.

So:

<guess>obias</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **C, R, N, E, U, T** are **not** in the secret word.
- **B** is in the word and **correctly placed in position 2**.
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 1 or 3**, so it must be in position 4 or 5.

For the next guess:
- Must have **B in position 2**.
- Must include **A** in position 4 or 5 (since positions 1, 3, and 2 are eliminated for A).
- Should test new common letters (e.g., **S, L, O, I, D, H**) to gather more information.

The word **OBIAS** fits:
- **O** in position 1 (tests a new vowel).
- **B** in position 2 (fixed, so ✓ expected).
- **I** in position 3 (tests a new letter).
- **A** in position 4 (tests if A is in position 4; if not, A must be in position 5).
- **S** in position 5 (tests a common consonant).

This guess efficiently tests the position of A while probing new letters.

<guess>obias</guess>",obias,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Second guess: ""about""
- A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word but not in position 1 (from about) and not in position 3 (from crane)
- B: ✓ (correct position, so B is the second letter of the secret word)
- O: - (in word, wrong position) -> O is in the word but not in position 3 (from about) and not in position 4? Actually, from ""about"", O was in position 3? Let me check: 
  In ""about"": 
    Position 1: A -> -
    Position 2: B -> ✓
    Position 3: O -> - (so O is in the word but not in position 3)
    Position 4: U -> x
    Position 5: T -> x

So O is in the word, but not in position 3. And we already knew from the first guess that A was not in position 3.

Now, we know:
- The secret word has the letter B in position 2.
- The secret word has the letter A, but not in position 1 (from about) and not in position 3 (from crane). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5? But wait, we have position 2 taken by B? So A cannot be in position 2? Because B is fixed at position 2? 

Actually, from the second guess: B is in position 2 and correct. So the secret word has B as the second letter. Therefore, the position 2 is fixed as B.

Now, A is in the word but not in position 1 (from about) and not in position 3 (from crane). Since position 2 is B, A must be in position 4 or 5? 

Also, we have:
- From crane: A was in position 3 and got '-', so not position 3.
- From about: A was in position 1 and got '-', so not position 1.
- Position 2 is B, so A must be in 4 or 5.

Additionally, we know:
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, N, E, U, T (from the x's in both guesses).
- The secret word contains A and B (and whatever else we haven't tested).

We also know from the first guess that A was present, and from the second guess that A is still present (but in a different position).

Now, let's list the knowns:
- Position 2: B (fixed)
- A is in the word, in position 4 or 5.

We need to find a word that:
- Has B as the second letter.
- Has A in either position 4 or 5.
- Avoids the letters: C, R, N, E, U, T (and any others we haven't seen? We haven't tested many, but these are eliminated).
- Uses new letters to test.

We have eliminated: C, R, N, E, U, T.

Remaining letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we know the word must have A (in position 4 or 5) and B (in position 2).

We need to test:
- Position 4: is A there? If we put A in position 4, we might get a check or a minus.
- Position 5: similarly.

But we can also test other letters.

We have 4 guesses left? Actually, we have used 2, so 4 left? But we are making the third guess.

We can try to test both possibilities? But we can only test one at a time.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has A in position 4 and then test it? Or in position 5?

But we don't know which one. So we can choose a word that has A in position 4 and see the feedback? 

But note: if we put A in position 4 and it's actually in position 5, we'll get a minus? And if we put it in position 5 and it's actually in 4, we'll get a minus? 

But we can also test a word that has A in one of the positions and also tests other common letters.

We must include A? Actually, we don't have to, but we know A is in the word so we should use it to avoid wasting a guess? 

But if we don't include A, we might get information about other letters? But we know A is in the word, so we should use it to try to locate it.

So let's try to form a word that has:
- Position 2: B (fixed)
- A in position 4? Or position 5?

We can try position 4 for A.

But we also want to test other common letters.

Example: ""B"" is fixed at position 2, so we need a word of the form: _ B _ _ _

With A in position 4: ? B ? A ?

Or A in position 5: ? B ? ? A

We also need to avoid the eliminated letters.

Let's try A in position 4.

Possible words:
- ""ABYSS"" -> but has S repeated? And Y, S. But also, we have eliminated S? No, we haven't eliminated S. But ABYSS has two S's? And A in position 1? But we are putting A in position 4? 

Wait, in ""ABYSS"": 
  Position 1: A -> but we know A is not in position 1? From the second guess, about put A in position 1 and got a minus? So A is not in position 1. So we cannot put A in position 1.

So we must have a letter in position 1 that is not A and not eliminated.

How about ""LABOR""? But R is eliminated? So no.

""LIBRA""? L, I, B, R, A -> R is eliminated? So no.

""OBIT""? Not a word.

""OBIAS""? O, B, I, A, S -> but O is in position 1? And we are putting A in position 4? 
  Positions: 
    1: O
    2: B (fixed)
    3: I
    4: A
    5: S

But we don't know if O, I, S are in the word? And we are testing A in position 4.

But the word ""OBIAS"" is valid? Yes.

But note: we have eliminated R, N, E, U, T, but O, I, S are new.

But wait: we have to avoid using too many vowels? We have only tested A and O? 

But we don't know about O? 

However, we have a problem: we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it's in position 4 or 5. So by putting A in position 4, we can test if it's in 4.

But we can also test other letters.

Another candidate: ""ABYSM"" - not a common word.

""KBAAS""? Not a word.

""LABDA""? Not a word.

How about ""LABIA""? L, A, B, I, A -> repeated A? And A in position 2 and 5? But position 2 is B? So we cannot have A in position 2. So LABia has A in position 2 and 5? But position 2 must be B? So no.

We must have B in position 2.

So let's think of words with B in position 2 and A in position 4.

Examples:
- ""ABYSS"" -> but A is in position 1? Not allowed. 
- ""OBIAS"" -> O, B, I, A, S -> positions: 1:O, 2:B, 3:I, 4:A, 5:S -> valid.

But OBIAS has A in position 4.

Another: ""ABACU"" -> but C is eliminated? And U is eliminated? So no.

""LIBEL""? L, I, B, E, L -> E is eliminated? So no.

""OBIES""? O, B, I, E, S -> E is eliminated? So no.

""ABIDE""? A, B, I, D, E -> E is eliminated? So no.

""ABIDE"" has E? Eliminated.

How about ""ABHOR""? A, B, H, O, R -> R is eliminated? So no.

""ABYSS"" is invalid because A is in position 1.

""OBAS""? Not 5 letters.

""OBBY""? Not a word.

""ABBOT""? A, B, B, O, T -> T is eliminated? And repeated B? So no.

""ABBOT"" has T? Eliminated.

So ""OBIAS"" seems a candidate: O, B, I, A, S -> with B in 2, A in 4.

But we have to check if it's valid: yes, it's a word (biasis).

But note: we are testing A in position 4. If the secret word has A in position 5, then we'll get a minus for A? And we'll know A is in 5.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 5.

For example: ""ABYSM"" -> not common.

""KBAAS"" -> not a word.

""LABRA""? R eliminated.

""LABDA"" -> not a word.

""ABOVE""? V and E? E is eliminated.

""ABUSE""? U and E eliminated.

It's hard to find words with A in position 5 and B in position 2.

How about ""OBAS""? Not 5 letters.

""OBBY"" -> not a word.

""ABBY"" -> not 5 letters? And has B repeated? 

Actually, ""ABBY"" is 5 letters? A-B-B-Y. But repeated B? And Y.

But we don't know if the word has repeated letters? 

But let's avoid repeats for now? 

Another word: ""ABACU"" -> C and U eliminated.

So perhaps ""OBIAS"" is a good choice.

But we have to consider: we are testing A in position 4. If we get a check for A, then we know A is in position 4. If we get a minus, then A must be in position 5 (since it's the only other option).

But we are also testing O, I, S.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 5? 

For example: ""OBIT""? Not a word.

""ABOIL""? Not a word.

""ABOMA""? But O in position 3? And A in position 5? 
  Positions: 
    1: A -> but we know A is not in position 1? From the second guess: about put A in position 1 and got a minus? So A is not in 1. So we cannot put A in 1.

""ABOMA"" has A in 1? Not allowed.

How about ""ABYSS"" -> A in 1? Not allowed.

So it's difficult to find a word with A in position 5 and B in position 2.

Another idea: ""KBAAS""? Not a word.

""LABIA"" -> L, A, B, I, A -> A in position 2 and 5? But position 2 must be B? So no.

We must have B in position 2.

So let's list words with B in position 2 and A in position 4 or 5.

Position 4: 
  The pattern is: _ B _ A _

We need a word: 
  First letter: not eliminated (so not C,R,N,E,U,T)
  Last two letters: not eliminated and not A? (unless repeated A? but we don't know) and not the eliminated ones.

Examples:
- ""ABBAY""? Not a word? 
- ""ABBAK""? Not a word.
- ""ABBAZ""? No.

Common words: 
- ""LABIA"" -> but pattern: L, A, B, I, A -> so position 2 is A? But we need B in position 2? So no.

Wait, no: the pattern is fixed: position 2 is B.

So for position 4: 
  Words: 
    ""ABBEY""? A, B, B, E, Y -> E eliminated? And repeated B? 
    ""ABBOT""? A, B, B, O, T -> T eliminated? 
    ""ABBY""? Not 5 letters? 
    ""ABBS""? Not a word? 
    ""ABUDS""? Not a word.

It's hard to find.

Perhaps A in position 5 is more promising?

Pattern: _ B _ _ A

Words:
- ""ABBS""? Not a word.
- ""ABOIL""? Not a word.
- ""ABOMA""? A in 1? Not allowed.
- ""ABOVE""? E eliminated.
- ""ABUSE""? U and E eliminated.
- ""ABYSS""? A in 1? Not allowed.

How about ""OBBA""? Not 5 letters.

""OBBE""? Not a word.

""ABBEY""? A in 1? Not allowed.

So maybe A in position 4 is more feasible? 

But we have ""OBIAS"": O, B, I, A, S -> 
  Position 1: O
  Position 2: B (fixed)
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: A
  Position 5: S

This avoids the eliminated letters? 
Eliminated: C, R, N, E, U, T -> none of these are in ""OBIAS"".

So ""OBIAS"" is a valid guess.

But what if the secret word has A in position 5? Then in ""OBIAS"", the A is in position 4? So we'll get a minus for A? And then we know A must be in 5? 

But we are also testing O, I, S.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 5? 

For example: ""OBIT""? Not a word.

""ABOON""? A in 1? Not allowed.

""ABOO""? A in 1? Not allowed.

""ABUZZ""? A in 1? Not allowed.

It's very hard to find a word with A in position 5 and B in position 2.

Another word: ""ABYSA""? Not a word.

""ABYSM""? Not common.

So perhaps A in position 4 is the best we can do? 

But we have another candidate: ""ABHOR""? But R eliminated.

How about ""ABHIL""? Not a word.

""ABIDE""? E eliminated.

So ""OBIAS"" seems a good choice.

But note: we are testing A in position 4. If we get a check, then we know A is in 4. If we get a minus, then A must be in 5.

Also, we are testing O, I, S.

We have not tested O, I, S before? Yes.

So let's go with ""OBIAS"".

But wait: what if the word has A in position 5? Then in ""OBIAS"", the A in position 4 will be a minus? And we'll know A is in 5? 

But we are also testing S at the end? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 5? But we can't find one easily.

Another word: ""ABYSM"" is not common, but let's check: A-B-Y-S-M -> A in position 1? Not allowed.

How about ""BBAS""? Not 5 letters.

I think ""OBIAS"" is a reasonable choice.

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any indication so far.

So I'll guess ""OBIAS"".

But let me confirm: 
  O: new
  B: we know is in position 2 (so we expect a check? But we are putting it in position 2? It is fixed, so we should get a check? Actually, we know B is in position 2, so we must put B in position 2? 

In ""OBIAS"", we are putting:
  Position 1: O
  Position 2: B (fixed, so we know it will be a check)
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: A
  Position 5: S

We are testing:
  O in position 1: if it's in the word? and if so, is it in position 1?
  I in position 3: testing I? 
  S in position 5: testing S.

And A in position 4: if it's correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and then we know A must be in position 5.

So we are effectively testing two possibilities: 
  - If A is in position 4, we get a check for A? Then we know the pattern: ? B ? A ?
  - If we get a minus for A, then A must be in position 5.

So we can get information regardless.

But we are also testing O, I, S.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in position 5? But we can't find one easily.

Another word: ""ABYSM"" is not valid? 

How about ""ABYSS""? A in 1? Not allowed.

So I think ""OBIAS"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word with A in position 5: 

  ""ABOON"" -> A in 1? Not allowed.

  ""ABUZZ"" -> A in 1? Not allowed.

  ""ABYSS"" -> A in 1? Not allowed.

  ""ABBBY"" -> A in 1? Not allowed.

  ""ABBY"" -> not 5 letters.

So I think ""OBIAS"" is the best we can do.

But note: we have not tested D, G, H, L, M, P, etc.

We can try ""OBIAS"" or we can try ""LABIA""? But LABia has A in position 2? Not allowed.

Another word: ""ABYSM"" -> A in 1? Not allowed.

How about ""BBAL""? Not 5 letters.

I think we have to go with ""OBIAS"".

But wait: what about ""ABYSM""? It's not common, but let's consider: A-B-Y-S-M -> A in position 1? Not allowed.

So no.

Perhaps ""ABHOR"" -> R eliminated.

I found: ""ABOON"" is a word? It means something? But A in 1? Not allowed.

So let's go with ""OBIAS"".

But note: we are testing A in position 4. If it's not there, then A must be in 5.

And we are testing O, I, S.

So I'll guess ""OBIAS"".

But let me write it: O B I A S

So:

Guess: O B I A S

But wait: we are putting A in position 4. If the secret word has A in position 5, then we'll get a minus for A? And we'll know A is in 5.

Similarly, if we get a check for A in position 4, then we know it's in 4.

But we are also testing O, I, S.

So this is good.

But what if the secret word has A in position 4? Then we get a check for A.

If not, then A must be in 5.

Also, we are testing O in position 1, I in position 3, S in position 5.

Now, we have to avoid the eliminated letters: we are using O, B, I, A, S. B is fixed, so we are testing O, I, S, and A (position).

So let's do that.

But note: we are using S at the end? 

Another candidate: ""ABYSS"" is invalid.

So I think ""OBIAS"" is a valid choice.

Therefore, third guess: ""OBIAS""

But let me double-check: 
  Pattern: _ B _ _ _
  We are testing: O in 1, B in 2 (fixed, so we know it will be ✓), I in 3, A in 4, S in 5.

  If A is in position 4, we get ✓ for A? 
  If A is in position 5, we get - for A? (because it's in the word but not in 4) and then we know A is in 5.

  And we test O, I, S.

  So we get information about O, I, S and the position of A.

  Also, we avoid the eliminated letters.

  So I'll go with ""OBIAS"".

But note: we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""obias"" is a valid English word.

So:

<guess>obias</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **C, R, N, E, U, T** are **not** in the secret word.
- **B** is in the word and **correctly placed in position 2**.
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 1 or 3**, so it must be in position 4 or 5.

For the next guess:
- Must have **B in position 2**.
- Must include **A** in position 4 or 5 (since positions 1, 3, and 2 are eliminated for A).
- Should test new common letters (e.g., **S, L, O, I, D, H**) to gather more information.

The word **OBIAS** fits:
- **O** in position 1 (tests a new vowel).
- **B** in position 2 (fixed, so ✓ expected).
- **I** in position 3 (tests a new letter).
- **A** in position 4 (tests if A is in position 4; if not, A must be in position 5).
- **S** in position 5 (tests a common consonant).

This guess efficiently tests the position of A while probing new letters.",Guess 3: obias -> FEEDBACK: O(✓) B(✓) I(✓) A(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
