We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C(✓) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)

 This means:
 - C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
 - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
 - A is not in the word.
 - N is not in the word.
 - E is not in the word.

 So, the secret word has the form: C R _ _ _

 We know that the letters A, N, and E are not in the word.

 Since the word is 5 letters and we have the first two letters as C and R, we need to guess the last three letters.

 We must avoid using the letters A, N, E.

 We also know that the word is a valid English word.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words that start with ""CR"" and do not contain A, N, or E.

 Some possibilities:
 - CROWD? But we don't know if D or W or other letters are present.
 - CROWN? Similarly, but we have to avoid E? Actually, CROWN has O and W, but no A, N, E? Let's check: C R O W N -> but N is not allowed (from feedback).

 Since N is not in the word, we cannot use N. Similarly, A and E are also out.

 So, we need a word that starts with ""CR"" and the remaining three letters are not A, N, E.

 Let's consider:
 - CROPS: C R O P S -> but we don't know if O, P, S are in the word? However, we haven't ruled them out.
 - CROWD: C R O W D -> again, no A, N, E.
 - CROWN: C R O W N -> has N, so not allowed.

 Another idea: What about ""CRUST""? But we have to check if U and S and T are allowed? We don't have any feedback against them.

 However, note that we have two correct letters already. We want to test as many new letters as possible to get more information.

 But we must remember that the word must start with ""CR"" and the last three letters must not be A, N, E.

 Let's list some words:
 - CRUST: C R U S T -> no A, N, E -> valid.
 - CRIMP: C R I M P -> valid.
 - CRUMB: C R U M B -> valid? But M and B are not excluded.
 - CRWTH: not common, and has W and H which are less common.

 We also know that the word does not contain A, N, E.

 We can choose a word that uses common letters and tests multiple possibilities.

 Since we have two fixed letters, we can try to cover more common consonants and vowels (but note that vowels are limited: we have already ruled out A and E, so the vowels left are I, O, U, and sometimes Y).

 Let's try to include a vowel in the third position? Or consonants.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRUST"" to test U, S, T.

 But note: we have three positions to test. We want to maximize information.

 Another common word: ""CRISP"" -> C R I S P -> tests I, S, P. However, we don't know if the word has I or not.

 However, we have to avoid A, N, E.

 Let's choose ""CRISP"" because it uses common letters and we haven't tested I, S, P.

 But wait: we already know that the word has C and R in the first two positions. So if we guess ""CRISP"", the feedback for the third, fourth, and fifth letters will tell us if they are correct or not.

 However, note that the word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any indication of that yet.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't repeat the letters we already know? But we are forced to use C and R in the first two positions.

 So, let's guess ""CRISP"".

 But note: the feedback for the first two letters was correct, so they are fixed. We are only testing the last three.

 However, we must consider that the word might have the letter we already know again? But we don't have any duplicates so far.

 But let's check: if we guess ""CRISP"", the feedback for C and R in the first two positions will be correct again, and then for I, S, P: they might be correct or not.

 But we don't have any reason to avoid using I, S, P.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that has a different set of letters to cover more ground? But we have only three positions to fill.

 Another idea: what about ""CRITH""? But that's not a common word.

 We should stick to common words.

 Let me think of more common words: 
 - CRUST (meaning: a crust over)
 - CRIMP (meaning: to compress)
 - CRISP (meaning: to make crisp)
 - CRUMB (meaning: to crumb)
 - CRAMP (meaning: to cramp)
 - CRIMP is already considered.

 But note: we have ruled out A, E, N. So the vowels that are left are I, O, U.

 We can try to use a word that has one of these vowels in the third position.

 I think ""CRISP"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and we haven't tested I, S, P.

 However, we must be cautious: the word might have the letter 'S' or 'P' or 'I'? We don't know.

 Alternatively, we could choose ""CRUST"" to test U, S, T.

 But let's see: we have 6 tries. We are on the second guess. We can try to cover more letters.

 Another common word: ""CROWD"" -> C R O W D -> tests O, W, D.

 But we don't know if O is in the word? We haven't tested O.

 We can also consider ""CROOK"" -> but that has two O's and we don't know if O is present.

 However, we are limited by the fact that we cannot use A, N, E.

 Let me list the available letters: we can use any letter except A, N, E.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 The word ""CRISP"": tests I, S, P (and we already know C and R are present and fixed).
 The word ""CRUST"": tests U, S, T.

 Which one gives more information? Both test three new letters.

 But note: we have already fixed two letters. So we are only testing three letters.

 I think both are reasonable.

 However, we might consider that the word might have a double letter? But we don't have any indication.

 Let's choose ""CRISP"" because it uses more common consonants.

 So, my second guess: ""CRISP""

 But note: we must make sure that the word is valid. ""CRISP"" is a valid English word.

 Therefore, we guess ""CRISP"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓)
- **R** is correct and in position 2 (✓)
- **A**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word (x)

The secret word starts with ""CR"" and does not contain A, N, or E. We need to test new letters in positions 3, 4, and 5.

I chose **CRISP** as the next guess because:
- It maintains the fixed ""CR"" in positions 1 and 2.
- It tests three new common letters (I, S, P) in the remaining positions.
- It avoids the excluded letters (A, N, E).
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help identify if I, S, or P are in the word and their positions.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

 - CRAMP (meaning: to cramp)
 - CRIMP is already considered.

 But note: we have ruled out A, E, N. So the vowels that are left are I, O, U.

 We can try to use a word that has one of these vowels in the third position.

 I think ""CRISP"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and we haven't tested I, S, P.

 However, we must be cautious: the word might have the letter 'S' or 'P' or 'I'? We don't know.

 Alternatively, we could choose ""CRUST"" to test U, S, T.

 But let's see: we have 6 tries. We are on the second guess. We can try to cover more letters.

 Another common word: ""CROWD"" -> C R O W D -> tests O, W, D.

 But we don't know if O is in the word? We haven't tested O.

 We can also consider ""CROOK"" -> but that has two O's and we don't know if O is present.

 However, we are limited by the fact that we cannot use A, N, E.

 Let me list the available letters: we can use any letter except A, N, E.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 The word ""CRISP"": tests I, S, P (and we already know C and R are present and fixed).
 The word ""CRUST"": tests U, S, T.

 Which one gives more information? Both test three new letters.

 But note: we have already fixed two letters. So we are only testing three letters.

 I think both are reasonable.

 However, we might consider that the word might have a double letter? But we don't have any indication.

 Let's choose ""CRISP"" because it uses more common consonants.

 So, my second guess: ""CRISP""

 But note: we must make sure that the word is valid. ""CRISP"" is a valid English word.

 Therefore, we guess ""CRISP"".

<guess>crisp</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓)
- **R** is correct and in position 2 (✓)
- **A**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word (x)

The secret word starts with ""CR"" and does not contain A, N, or E. We need to test new letters in positions 3, 4, and 5.

I chose **CRISP** as the next guess because:
- It maintains the fixed ""CR"" in positions 1 and 2.
- It tests three new common letters (I, S, P) in the remaining positions.
- It avoids the excluded letters (A, N, E).
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help identify if I, S, or P are in the word and their positions.

We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(✓) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - This tells us that the word starts with ""CR"", and the letters A, N, E are not in the word.

2. ""crisp"": C(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) P(x)
   - This confirms that the first two letters are still correct (C and R). The third, fourth, and fifth letters are now marked as 'x', meaning that I, S, P are not in the word at all.

So, combining the information:
- The secret word is of the form: C R _ _ _
- Excluded letters: A, N, E, I, S, P
- We know that the word does not contain any of these: A, N, E, I, S, P.

Now, we need to think of a word that:
- Starts with ""CR""
- Does not contain A, N, E, I, S, P
- Uses only letters that are possible.

What letters are left? We have the entire alphabet minus the excluded ones.

Excluded: A, E, I, N, P, S. That's 6 letters.

Remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we already have C and R in the word. Since C and R are fixed in positions 1 and 2, the remaining letters must be from the set above, and they can be repeated? But we don't have any indication of repetition so far.

We need to form a 5-letter word that starts with ""CR"" and uses only the remaining letters.

Let's brainstorm some words:
- ""CROWD"": But we have to check if W and D are allowed? Yes, because they are not excluded. However, we already excluded I, S, P. But note: ""CROWD"" has O and W, D. But we don't know if O is allowed? We haven't tested O. And W and D are new.

But wait: we must avoid the excluded letters: A, N, E, I, S, P. So ""CROWD"" uses W, D, O -> none of these are excluded? 
- W: not excluded -> okay
- D: not excluded -> okay
- O: not excluded -> okay

However, we already have two correct letters (C and R) and we are using them again? But that's okay because they are in the same positions.

But note: the feedback for the second guess told us that I, S, P are not in the word. So we can use W, D, O, etc.

But let's see other possibilities:

- ""CROFT"": C R O F T -> uses O, F, T. But F and T are not excluded? Yes.
- ""CROWL"": not common, and has L? But we don't know if L is allowed? L is not excluded.
- ""CROUP"": but that has P? P is excluded. So no.
- ""CROWD"": as above.

But we must also consider that the word must be valid.

Another idea: ""CRUMB"" -> but we have to check if U and M and B are allowed? Yes. But note: ""CRUMB"" has U and M, but we haven't tested U, M, B.

However, we already have two correct letters. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

But we have three positions to test (3,4,5). We should try to cover common letters.

Common letters left: T, O, L, U, D, W, M, etc.

We can try ""CROWD"" to test W, D, O.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""CROWD"" is valid because it uses W, D, O, which are not excluded.

Alternatively, we can try ""CRUMB"" to test U, M, B.

But which one gives more information? Both test three new letters.

We might also consider ""CROOK"": C R O O K -> but has two O's? And K is new. But we don't know if O is repeated? It might be.

But let's look for words that use more common letters.

Another word: ""CROFT"" (meaning: a craft) -> C R O F T -> tests O, F, T.

Or ""CROWD"" (meaning: a crowd) -> C R O W D.

We can also consider ""CRUMB"" (meaning: to crumb) -> C R U M B -> tests U, M, B.

But note: we have already excluded I, S, P. So we are safe.

We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter that is in the word.

Since we have no information about the last three letters, we should choose a word that uses common letters.

Let's list the frequency of letters in English words (5-letter, starting with CR):

- T: very common
- O: common
- L: common
- U: common
- D: common
- M: common
- W: less common but we need to test it?

We can try to include T, O, L, U, D, M, etc.

But we have three positions to test. We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Possible words:
- ""CROFT"": tests O, F, T -> F is less common? But T and O are common.
- ""CROWD"": tests W, D, O -> W and D are medium frequency.
- ""CRUMB"": tests U, M, B -> U and M are common, B is less common.

Another word: ""CROUP"" is invalid because P is excluded.

What about ""CROWL""? Meaning: a crowl? Not common. But we can check: C R O W L -> tests O, W, L.

But ""CROWL"" is a valid word? Actually, it's not very common, but it is accepted in some dictionaries.

We can also consider ""CROOK"": C R O O K -> tests O (repeated) and K.

But we don't know if O is in the word. So testing O might be good.

Alternatively, we can try ""DROUGHT"" but that's 6 letters? No, we need 5.

Another idea: ""CROFT"" is a good candidate.

But let's think: we have to avoid A, N, E, I, S, P. So the word must be composed of letters from the set: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try ""CROWD"", but let's see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

What about ""CROFT""? It uses F, which is less common. But T and O are common.

Alternatively, ""CROOK"" has two O's and K.

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.

We can also consider ""CROWL"", but it's not very common.

Another common word: ""CROWD"" is acceptable.

But let me check: is ""CROWD"" a valid word? Yes.

We can also do ""CROUP"" but P is excluded.

How about ""CROWL""? It is a word (meaning: to crowl, or to fill with crowding? But it's rare). Alternatively, ""CROFT"" is more common.

But ""CROFT"" uses F, which we haven't tested. Similarly, ""CROWD"" uses W and D.

We might choose ""CROFT"" to test T and O? But F is less common.

Alternatively, we can try ""CROWD"" to test W and D.

But note: we have the letter O. It might be present.

Another word: ""CROOK"" -> C R O O K -> tests O (repeated) and K.

But we don't know if O is present.

We can also consider ""CROFT"" and ""CROWD"". I think ""CROWD"" is more common.

But let's look for a word that uses T, O, L, U, etc.

What about ""CULT""? But that's 4 letters. We need 5.

""CRUST"" is a common word: C R U S T -> but S is excluded (from the second feedback: S(x)). So we cannot use S.

Similarly, ""CRIMP"" has P? P is excluded.

So we must avoid S, P, etc.

Another word: ""CROWD"" is acceptable.

But let me confirm: ""CROWD"" uses W, D, O. None of these are excluded.

So I'll go with ""CROWD"".

But wait: what about ""CROUP""? No, P is excluded.

Or ""CROOK"": O is repeated, and K is new.

But ""CROWD"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, ""CROFT"" is also acceptable.

But let's choose ""CROWD"" because it tests W and D, which are medium frequency.

We can also consider ""CULTI"" but I is excluded and it's 5 letters? ""CULTI"" has I? I is excluded. So no.

Another word: ""CROWN"" -> but N is excluded? N is excluded from the first feedback. So we cannot use N.

Therefore, ""CROWN"" is invalid.

So, we are left with words like ""CROWD"", ""CROFT"", ""CRUMB"", ""CROOK"", etc.

I think ""CROWD"" is a good choice.

But let me see: we have to test the last three positions. We are testing W, D, O.

If we get feedback that W is not in the word, or D is not, or O is not, then we can eliminate them.

But we are on the third guess, so we can try.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has a vowel? The only vowel left is O? And U? But we don't have many vowels. The word must have at least one vowel? Not necessarily, but most words do. The vowels we have left are O, U, and sometimes Y.

We have O and U available.

So, let's choose ""CROWD"".

But note: we are not forced to use the fixed C and R? Actually, we are: because we know the first two letters are C and R, so we must use them.

So, I'll guess ""CROWD"".

But wait: what if the word has a repeated letter? We don't know. But we haven't seen any repetition so far.

So, the guess is ""CROWD"".

But let me double-check: the word must be 5 letters, starting with CR, and not containing A, N, E, I, S, P.

""CROWD"": C, R, O, W, D -> no excluded letters? 
- C: we know is in the word (but we are using it again in position 1, which is fixed) -> okay
- R: fixed in position 2 -> okay
- O: new letter -> okay
- W: new letter -> okay
- D: new letter -> okay

So it's valid.

Therefore, we guess ""CROWD"".

But note: we are testing O, W, D. If any of these are in the word, we'll get feedback.

Alternatively, we can try ""CROFT"" to test F and T.

But I think ""CROWD"" is fine.

We'll go with ""CROWD"".

So, the third guess is ""CROWD"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **C** and **R** are confirmed in positions 1 and 2 (✓).
- **A**, **N**, **E**, **I**, **S**, and **P** are excluded (x).

The secret word is of the form: **C R _ _ _**, and the last three letters must be from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). No repeated letters have been indicated yet.

### Strategy for the next guess:
- Test new common letters in positions 3–5 to gather more information.
- Prioritize high-frequency consonants (e.g., T, L, D, M) and vowels (O, U, Y).
- Avoid excluded letters and reuse of C/R only in positions 1–2.

I chose **CROWD** because:
- It maintains ""CR"" in positions 1–2.
- It tests three new letters: **O** (vowel), **W**, and **D**.
- It uses only allowed letters (none excluded).
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help identify if O, W, or D are in the word and their positions.

<guess>crowd</guess>",crowd,"We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(✓) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)

2. ""crisp"": C(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) P(x)

Alternatively, we can try ""DROUGHT"" but that's 6 letters? No, we need 5.

Another idea: ""CROFT"" is a good candidate.

But let's think: we have to avoid A, N, E, I, S, P. So the word must be composed of letters from the set: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try ""CROWD"", but let's see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

What about ""CROFT""? It uses F, which is less common. But T and O are common.

Alternatively, ""CROOK"" has two O's and K.

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.

We can also consider ""CROWL"", but it's not very common.

Another common word: ""CROWD"" is acceptable.

But let me check: is ""CROWD"" a valid word? Yes.

We can also do ""CROUP"" but P is excluded.

How about ""CROWL""? It is a word (meaning: to crowl, or to fill with crowding? But it's rare). Alternatively, ""CROFT"" is more common.

But ""CROFT"" uses F, which we haven't tested. Similarly, ""CROWD"" uses W and D.

We might choose ""CROFT"" to test T and O? But F is less common.

Alternatively, we can try ""CROWD"" to test W and D.

But note: we have the letter O. It might be present.

Another word: ""CROOK"" -> C R O O K -> tests O (repeated) and K.

But we don't know if O is present.

We can also consider ""CROFT"" and ""CROWD"". I think ""CROWD"" is more common.

But let's look for a word that uses T, O, L, U, etc.

What about ""CULT""? But that's 4 letters. We need 5.

""CRUST"" is a common word: C R U S T -> but S is excluded (from the second feedback: S(x)). So we cannot use S.

Similarly, ""CRIMP"" has P? P is excluded.

So we must avoid S, P, etc.

Another word: ""CROWD"" is acceptable.

But let me confirm: ""CROWD"" uses W, D, O. None of these are excluded.

So I'll go with ""CROWD"".

But wait: what about ""CROUP""? No, P is excluded.

Or ""CROOK"": O is repeated, and K is new.

But ""CROWD"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, ""CROFT"" is also acceptable.

But let's choose ""CROWD"" because it tests W and D, which are medium frequency.

We can also consider ""CULTI"" but I is excluded and it's 5 letters? ""CULTI"" has I? I is excluded. So no.

Another word: ""CROWN"" -> but N is excluded? N is excluded from the first feedback. So we cannot use N.

Therefore, ""CROWN"" is invalid.

So, we are left with words like ""CROWD"", ""CROFT"", ""CRUMB"", ""CROOK"", etc.

I think ""CROWD"" is a good choice.

But let me see: we have to test the last three positions. We are testing W, D, O.

If we get feedback that W is not in the word, or D is not, or O is not, then we can eliminate them.

But we are on the third guess, so we can try.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has a vowel? The only vowel left is O? And U? But we don't have many vowels. The word must have at least one vowel? Not necessarily, but most words do. The vowels we have left are O, U, and sometimes Y.

We have O and U available.

So, let's choose ""CROWD"".

But note: we are not forced to use the fixed C and R? Actually, we are: because we know the first two letters are C and R, so we must use them.

So, I'll guess ""CROWD"".

But wait: what if the word has a repeated letter? We don't know. But we haven't seen any repetition so far.

So, the guess is ""CROWD"".

But let me double-check: the word must be 5 letters, starting with CR, and not containing A, N, E, I, S, P.

""CROWD"": C, R, O, W, D -> no excluded letters? 
- C: we know is in the word (but we are using it again in position 1, which is fixed) -> okay
- R: fixed in position 2 -> okay
- O: new letter -> okay
- W: new letter -> okay
- D: new letter -> okay

So it's valid.

Therefore, we guess ""CROWD"".

But note: we are testing O, W, D. If any of these are in the word, we'll get feedback.

Alternatively, we can try ""CROFT"" to test F and T.

But I think ""CROWD"" is fine.

We'll go with ""CROWD"".

So, the third guess is ""CROWD"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **C** and **R** are confirmed in positions 1 and 2 (✓).
- **A**, **N**, **E**, **I**, **S**, and **P** are excluded (x).

The secret word is of the form: **C R _ _ _**, and the last three letters must be from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). No repeated letters have been indicated yet.

### Strategy for the next guess:
- Test new common letters in positions 3–5 to gather more information.
- Prioritize high-frequency consonants (e.g., T, L, D, M) and vowels (O, U, Y).
- Avoid excluded letters and reuse of C/R only in positions 1–2.

I chose **CROWD** because:
- It maintains ""CR"" in positions 1–2.
- It tests three new letters: **O** (vowel), **W**, and **D**.
- It uses only allowed letters (none excluded).
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help identify if O, W, or D are in the word and their positions.",Guess 3: crowd -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) D(x),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C(✓) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)

 This means:
 - C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
 - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
 - A is not in the word.
 - N is not in the word.
 - E is not in the word.

 So, the secret word has the form: C R _ _ _

 We know that the letters A, N, and E are not in the word.

 Since the word is 5 letters and we have the first two letters as C and R, we need to guess the last three letters.

 We must avoid using the letters A, N, E.

 We also know that the word is a valid English word.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words that start with ""CR"" and do not contain A, N, or E.

 Some possibilities:
 - CROWD? But we don't know if D or W or other letters are present.
 - CROWN? Similarly, but we have to avoid E? Actually, CROWN has O and W, but no A, N, E? Let's check: C R O W N -> but N is not allowed (from feedback).

 Since N is not in the word, we cannot use N. Similarly, A and E are also out.

 So, we need a word that starts with ""CR"" and the remaining three letters are not A, N, E.

 Let's consider:
 - CROPS: C R O P S -> but we don't know if O, P, S are in the word? However, we haven't ruled them out.
 - CROWD: C R O W D -> again, no A, N, E.
 - CROWN: C R O W N -> has N, so not allowed.

 Another idea: What about ""CRUST""? But we have to check if U and S and T are allowed? We don't have any feedback against them.

 However, note that we have two correct letters already. We want to test as many new letters as possible to get more information.

 But we must remember that the word must start with ""CR"" and the last three letters must not be A, N, E.

 Let's list some words:
 - CRUST: C R U S T -> no A, N, E -> valid.
 - CRIMP: C R I M P -> valid.
 - CRUMB: C R U M B -> valid? But M and B are not excluded.
 - CRWTH: not common, and has W and H which are less common.

 We also know that the word does not contain A, N, E.

 We can choose a word that uses common letters and tests multiple possibilities.

 Since we have two fixed letters, we can try to cover more common consonants and vowels (but note that vowels are limited: we have already ruled out A and E, so the vowels left are I, O, U, and sometimes Y).

 Let's try to include a vowel in the third position? Or consonants.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRUST"" to test U, S, T.

 But note: we have three positions to test. We want to maximize information.

 Another common word: ""CRISP"" -> C R I S P -> tests I, S, P. However, we don't know if the word has I or not.

 However, we have to avoid A, N, E.

 Let's choose ""CRISP"" because it uses common letters and we haven't tested I, S, P.

 But wait: we already know that the word has C and R in the first two positions. So if we guess ""CRISP"", the feedback for the third, fourth, and fifth letters will tell us if they are correct or not.

 However, note that the word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any indication of that yet.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't repeat the letters we already know? But we are forced to use C and R in the first two positions.

 So, let's guess ""CRISP"".

 But note: the feedback for the first two letters was correct, so they are fixed. We are only testing the last three.

 However, we must consider that the word might have the letter we already know again? But we don't have any duplicates so far.

 But let's check: if we guess ""CRISP"", the feedback for C and R in the first two positions will be correct again, and then for I, S, P: they might be correct or not.

 But we don't have any reason to avoid using I, S, P.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that has a different set of letters to cover more ground? But we have only three positions to fill.

 Another idea: what about ""CRITH""? But that's not a common word.

 We should stick to common words.

 Let me think of more common words: 
 - CRUST (meaning: a crust over)
 - CRIMP (meaning: to compress)
 - CRISP (meaning: to make crisp)
 - CRUMB (meaning: to crumb)
 - CRAMP (meaning: to cramp)
 - CRIMP is already considered.

 But note: we have ruled out A, E, N. So the vowels that are left are I, O, U.

 We can try to use a word that has one of these vowels in the third position.

 I think ""CRISP"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and we haven't tested I, S, P.

 However, we must be cautious: the word might have the letter 'S' or 'P' or 'I'? We don't know.

 Alternatively, we could choose ""CRUST"" to test U, S, T.

 But let's see: we have 6 tries. We are on the second guess. We can try to cover more letters.

 Another common word: ""CROWD"" -> C R O W D -> tests O, W, D.

 But we don't know if O is in the word? We haven't tested O.

 We can also consider ""CROOK"" -> but that has two O's and we don't know if O is present.

 However, we are limited by the fact that we cannot use A, N, E.

 Let me list the available letters: we can use any letter except A, N, E.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 The word ""CRISP"": tests I, S, P (and we already know C and R are present and fixed).
 The word ""CRUST"": tests U, S, T.

 Which one gives more information? Both test three new letters.

 But note: we have already fixed two letters. So we are only testing three letters.

 I think both are reasonable.

 However, we might consider that the word might have a double letter? But we don't have any indication.

 Let's choose ""CRISP"" because it uses more common consonants.

 So, my second guess: ""CRISP""

 But note: we must make sure that the word is valid. ""CRISP"" is a valid English word.

 Therefore, we guess ""CRISP"".

<guess>crisp</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓)
- **R** is correct and in position 2 (✓)
- **A**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word (x)

The secret word starts with ""CR"" and does not contain A, N, or E. We need to test new letters in positions 3, 4, and 5.

I chose **CRISP** as the next guess because:
- It maintains the fixed ""CR"" in positions 1 and 2.
- It tests three new common letters (I, S, P) in the remaining positions.
- It avoids the excluded letters (A, N, E).
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help identify if I, S, or P are in the word and their positions.

<guess>crisp</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: crisp -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) P(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(✓) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - This tells us that the word starts with ""CR"", and the letters A, N, E are not in the word.

2. ""crisp"": C(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) P(x)
   - This confirms that the first two letters are still correct (C and R). The third, fourth, and fifth letters are now marked as 'x', meaning that I, S, P are not in the word at all.

So, combining the information:
- The secret word is of the form: C R _ _ _
- Excluded letters: A, N, E, I, S, P
- We know that the word does not contain any of these: A, N, E, I, S, P.

Now, we need to think of a word that:
- Starts with ""CR""
- Does not contain A, N, E, I, S, P
- Uses only letters that are possible.

What letters are left? We have the entire alphabet minus the excluded ones.

Excluded: A, E, I, N, P, S. That's 6 letters.

Remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we already have C and R in the word. Since C and R are fixed in positions 1 and 2, the remaining letters must be from the set above, and they can be repeated? But we don't have any indication of repetition so far.

We need to form a 5-letter word that starts with ""CR"" and uses only the remaining letters.

Let's brainstorm some words:
- ""CROWD"": But we have to check if W and D are allowed? Yes, because they are not excluded. However, we already excluded I, S, P. But note: ""CROWD"" has O and W, D. But we don't know if O is allowed? We haven't tested O. And W and D are new.

But wait: we must avoid the excluded letters: A, N, E, I, S, P. So ""CROWD"" uses W, D, O -> none of these are excluded? 
- W: not excluded -> okay
- D: not excluded -> okay
- O: not excluded -> okay

However, we already have two correct letters (C and R) and we are using them again? But that's okay because they are in the same positions.

But note: the feedback for the second guess told us that I, S, P are not in the word. So we can use W, D, O, etc.

But let's see other possibilities:

- ""CROFT"": C R O F T -> uses O, F, T. But F and T are not excluded? Yes.
- ""CROWL"": not common, and has L? But we don't know if L is allowed? L is not excluded.
- ""CROUP"": but that has P? P is excluded. So no.
- ""CROWD"": as above.

But we must also consider that the word must be valid.

Another idea: ""CRUMB"" -> but we have to check if U and M and B are allowed? Yes. But note: ""CRUMB"" has U and M, but we haven't tested U, M, B.

However, we already have two correct letters. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

But we have three positions to test (3,4,5). We should try to cover common letters.

Common letters left: T, O, L, U, D, W, M, etc.

We can try ""CROWD"" to test W, D, O.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""CROWD"" is valid because it uses W, D, O, which are not excluded.

Alternatively, we can try ""CRUMB"" to test U, M, B.

But which one gives more information? Both test three new letters.

We might also consider ""CROOK"": C R O O K -> but has two O's? And K is new. But we don't know if O is repeated? It might be.

But let's look for words that use more common letters.

Another word: ""CROFT"" (meaning: a craft) -> C R O F T -> tests O, F, T.

Or ""CROWD"" (meaning: a crowd) -> C R O W D.

We can also consider ""CRUMB"" (meaning: to crumb) -> C R U M B -> tests U, M, B.

But note: we have already excluded I, S, P. So we are safe.

We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter that is in the word.

Since we have no information about the last three letters, we should choose a word that uses common letters.

Let's list the frequency of letters in English words (5-letter, starting with CR):

- T: very common
- O: common
- L: common
- U: common
- D: common
- M: common
- W: less common but we need to test it?

We can try to include T, O, L, U, D, M, etc.

But we have three positions to test. We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Possible words:
- ""CROFT"": tests O, F, T -> F is less common? But T and O are common.
- ""CROWD"": tests W, D, O -> W and D are medium frequency.
- ""CRUMB"": tests U, M, B -> U and M are common, B is less common.

Another word: ""CROUP"" is invalid because P is excluded.

What about ""CROWL""? Meaning: a crowl? Not common. But we can check: C R O W L -> tests O, W, L.

But ""CROWL"" is a valid word? Actually, it's not very common, but it is accepted in some dictionaries.

We can also consider ""CROOK"": C R O O K -> tests O (repeated) and K.

But we don't know if O is in the word. So testing O might be good.

Alternatively, we can try ""DROUGHT"" but that's 6 letters? No, we need 5.

Another idea: ""CROFT"" is a good candidate.

But let's think: we have to avoid A, N, E, I, S, P. So the word must be composed of letters from the set: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try ""CROWD"", but let's see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

What about ""CROFT""? It uses F, which is less common. But T and O are common.

Alternatively, ""CROOK"" has two O's and K.

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.

We can also consider ""CROWL"", but it's not very common.

Another common word: ""CROWD"" is acceptable.

But let me check: is ""CROWD"" a valid word? Yes.

We can also do ""CROUP"" but P is excluded.

How about ""CROWL""? It is a word (meaning: to crowl, or to fill with crowding? But it's rare). Alternatively, ""CROFT"" is more common.

But ""CROFT"" uses F, which we haven't tested. Similarly, ""CROWD"" uses W and D.

We might choose ""CROFT"" to test T and O? But F is less common.

Alternatively, we can try ""CROWD"" to test W and D.

But note: we have the letter O. It might be present.

Another word: ""CROOK"" -> C R O O K -> tests O (repeated) and K.

But we don't know if O is present.

We can also consider ""CROFT"" and ""CROWD"". I think ""CROWD"" is more common.

But let's look for a word that uses T, O, L, U, etc.

What about ""CULT""? But that's 4 letters. We need 5.

""CRUST"" is a common word: C R U S T -> but S is excluded (from the second feedback: S(x)). So we cannot use S.

Similarly, ""CRIMP"" has P? P is excluded.

So we must avoid S, P, etc.

Another word: ""CROWD"" is acceptable.

But let me confirm: ""CROWD"" uses W, D, O. None of these are excluded.

So I'll go with ""CROWD"".

But wait: what about ""CROUP""? No, P is excluded.

Or ""CROOK"": O is repeated, and K is new.

But ""CROWD"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, ""CROFT"" is also acceptable.

But let's choose ""CROWD"" because it tests W and D, which are medium frequency.

We can also consider ""CULTI"" but I is excluded and it's 5 letters? ""CULTI"" has I? I is excluded. So no.

Another word: ""CROWN"" -> but N is excluded? N is excluded from the first feedback. So we cannot use N.

Therefore, ""CROWN"" is invalid.

So, we are left with words like ""CROWD"", ""CROFT"", ""CRUMB"", ""CROOK"", etc.

I think ""CROWD"" is a good choice.

But let me see: we have to test the last three positions. We are testing W, D, O.

If we get feedback that W is not in the word, or D is not, or O is not, then we can eliminate them.

But we are on the third guess, so we can try.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has a vowel? The only vowel left is O? And U? But we don't have many vowels. The word must have at least one vowel? Not necessarily, but most words do. The vowels we have left are O, U, and sometimes Y.

We have O and U available.

So, let's choose ""CROWD"".

But note: we are not forced to use the fixed C and R? Actually, we are: because we know the first two letters are C and R, so we must use them.

So, I'll guess ""CROWD"".

But wait: what if the word has a repeated letter? We don't know. But we haven't seen any repetition so far.

So, the guess is ""CROWD"".

But let me double-check: the word must be 5 letters, starting with CR, and not containing A, N, E, I, S, P.

""CROWD"": C, R, O, W, D -> no excluded letters? 
- C: we know is in the word (but we are using it again in position 1, which is fixed) -> okay
- R: fixed in position 2 -> okay
- O: new letter -> okay
- W: new letter -> okay
- D: new letter -> okay

So it's valid.

Therefore, we guess ""CROWD"".

But note: we are testing O, W, D. If any of these are in the word, we'll get feedback.

Alternatively, we can try ""CROFT"" to test F and T.

But I think ""CROWD"" is fine.

We'll go with ""CROWD"".

So, the third guess is ""CROWD"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **C** and **R** are confirmed in positions 1 and 2 (✓).
- **A**, **N**, **E**, **I**, **S**, and **P** are excluded (x).

The secret word is of the form: **C R _ _ _**, and the last three letters must be from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). No repeated letters have been indicated yet.

### Strategy for the next guess:
- Test new common letters in positions 3–5 to gather more information.
- Prioritize high-frequency consonants (e.g., T, L, D, M) and vowels (O, U, Y).
- Avoid excluded letters and reuse of C/R only in positions 1–2.

I chose **CROWD** because:
- It maintains ""CR"" in positions 1–2.
- It tests three new letters: **O** (vowel), **W**, and **D**.
- It uses only allowed letters (none excluded).
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help identify if O, W, or D are in the word and their positions.

But we have only three positions to fill.\n\n Another idea: what about ""CRITH""? But that\'s not a common word.\n\n We should stick to common words.\n\n Let me think of more common words: \n - CRUST (meaning: a crust over)\n - CRIMP (meaning: to compress)\n - CRISP (meaning: to make crisp)\n - CRUMB (meaning: to crumb)\n - CRAMP (meaning: to cramp)\n - CRIMP is already considered.\n\n But note: we have ruled out A, E, N. So the vowels that are left are I, O, U.\n\n We can try to use a word that has one of these vowels in the third position.\n\n I think ""CRISP"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and we haven\'t tested I, S, P.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the word might have the letter \'S\' or \'P\' or \'I\'? We don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we could choose ""CRUST"" to test U, S, T.\n\n But let\'s see: we have 6 tries. We are on the second guess. We can try to cover more letters.\n\n Another common word: ""CROWD"" -> C R O W D -> tests O, W, D.\n\n But we don\'t know if O is in the word? We haven\'t tested O.\n\n We can also consider ""CROOK"" -> but that has two O\'s and we don\'t know if O is present.\n\n However, we are limited by the fact that we cannot use A, N, E.\n\n Let me list the available letters: we can use any letter except A, N, E.\n\n We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n The word ""CRISP"": tests I, S, P (and we already know C and R are present and fixed).\n The word ""CRUST"": tests U, S, T.\n\n Which one gives more information? Both test three new letters.\n\n But note: we have already fixed two letters.

But we don\'t have any indication of repetition so far.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that starts with ""CR"" and uses only the remaining letters.\n\nLet\'s brainstorm some words:\n- ""CROWD"": But we have to check if W and D are allowed? Yes, because they are not excluded. However, we already excluded I, S, P. But note: ""CROWD"" has O and W, D. But we don\'t know if O is allowed? We haven\'t tested O.

But that\'s okay because they are in the same positions.\n\nBut note: the feedback for the second guess told us that I, S, P are not in the word.

But we don\'t know if L is allowed? L is not excluded.\n- ""CROUP"": but that has P? P is excluded. So no.\n- ""CROWD"": as above.\n\nBut we must also consider that the word must be valid.\n\nAnother idea: ""CRUMB"" -> but we have to check if U and M and B are allowed? Yes. But note: ""CRUMB"" has U and M, but we haven\'t tested U, M, B.\n\nHowever, we already have two correct letters. We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nBut we have three positions to test (3,4,5).

""CROWD"" is valid because it uses W, D, O, which are not excluded.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""CRUMB"" to test U, M, B.\n\nBut which one gives more information? Both test three new letters.\n\nWe might also consider ""CROOK"": C R O O K -> but has two O\'s? And K is new. But we don\'t know if O is repeated? It might be.\n\nBut let\'s look for words that use more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""CROFT"" (meaning: a craft) -> C R O F T -> tests O, F, T.\n\nOr ""CROWD"" (meaning: a crowd) -> C R O W D.\n\nWe can also consider ""CRUMB"" (meaning: to crumb) -> C R U M B -> tests U, M, B.\n\nBut note: we have already excluded I, S, P. So we are safe.\n\nWe want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter that is in the word.\n\nSince we have no information about the last three letters, we should choose a word that uses common letters.\n\nLet\'s list the frequency of letters in English words (5-letter, starting with CR):\n\n- T: very common\n- O: common\n- L: common\n- U: common\n- D: common\n- M: common\n- W: less common but we need to test it?\n\nWe can try to include T, O, L, U, D, M, etc.\n\nBut we have three positions to test.

Meaning: a crowl? Not common. But we can check: C R O W L -> tests O, W, L.\n\nBut ""CROWL"" is a valid word? Actually, it\'s not very common, but it is accepted in some dictionaries.\n\nWe can also consider ""CROOK"": C R O O K -> tests O (repeated) and K.\n\nBut we don\'t know if O is in the word. So testing O might be good.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""DROUGHT"" but that\'s 6 letters? No, we need 5.\n\nAnother idea: ""CROFT"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut let\'s think: we have to avoid A, N, E, I, S, P. So the word must be composed of letters from the set: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe can try ""CROWD"", but let\'s see if there is a word that uses more common letters.\n\nWhat about ""CROFT""? It uses F, which is less common. But T and O are common.\n\nAlternatively, ""CROOK"" has two O\'s and K.\n\nBut note: we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.\n\nWe can also consider ""CROWL"", but it\'s not very common.\n\nAnother common word: ""CROWD"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let me check: is ""CROWD"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nWe can also do ""CROUP"" but P is excluded.\n\nHow about ""CROWL""? It is a word (meaning: to crowl, or to fill with crowding? But it\'s rare). Alternatively, ""CROFT"" is more common.\n\nBut ""CROFT"" uses F, which we haven\'t tested. Similarly, ""CROWD"" uses W and D.\n\nWe might choose ""CROFT"" to test T and O? But F is less common.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""CROWD"" to test W and D.\n\nBut note: we have the letter O. It might be present.\n\nAnother word: ""CROOK"" -> C R O O K -> tests O (repeated) and K.\n\nBut we don\'t know if O is present.\n\nWe can also consider ""CROFT"" and ""CROWD"". I think ""CROWD"" is more common.\n\nBut let\'s look for a word that uses T, O, L, U, etc.\n\nWhat about ""CULT""? But that\'s 4 letters. We need 5.\n\n""CRUST"" is a common word: C R U S T -> but S is excluded (from the second feedback: S(x)). So we cannot use S.\n\nSimilarly, ""CRIMP"" has P? P is excluded.\n\nSo we must avoid S, P, etc.\n\nAnother word: ""CROWD"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let me confirm: ""CROWD"" uses W, D, O. None of these are excluded.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CROWD"".\n\nBut wait: what about ""CROUP""? No, P is excluded.\n\nOr ""CROOK"": O is repeated, and K is new.\n\nBut ""CROWD"" is a good choice.\n\nAlternatively, ""CROFT"" is also acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s choose ""CROWD"" because it tests W and D, which are medium frequency.\n\nWe can also consider ""CULTI"" but I is excluded and it\'s 5 letters? ""CULTI"" has I? I is excluded. So no.\n\nAnother word: ""CROWN"" -> but N is excluded? N is excluded from the first feedback. So we cannot use N.\n\nTherefore, ""CROWN"" is invalid.\n\nSo, we are left with words like ""CROWD"", ""CROFT"", ""CRUMB"", ""CROOK"", etc.\n\nI think ""CROWD"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see: we have to test the last three positions. We are testing W, D, O.\n\nIf we get feedback that W is not in the word, or D is not, or O is not, then we can eliminate them.\n\nBut we are on the third guess, so we can try.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has a vowel? The only vowel left is O? And U? But we don\'t have many vowels. The word must have at least one vowel? Not necessarily, but most words do. The vowels we have left are O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\nWe have O and U available.\n\nSo, let\'s choose ""CROWD"".\n\nBut note: we are not forced to use the fixed C and R? Actually, we are: because we know the first two letters are C and R, so we must use them.\n\nSo, I\'ll guess ""CROWD"".\n\nBut wait: what if the word has a repeated letter? We don\'t know. But we haven\'t seen any repetition so far.\n\nSo, the guess is ""CROWD"".\n\nBut let me double-check: the word must be 5 letters, starting with CR, and not containing A, N, E, I, S, P.\n\n""CROWD"": C, R, O, W, D -> no excluded letters? \n- C: we know is in the word (but we are using it again in position 1, which is fixed) -> okay\n- R: fixed in position 2 -> okay\n- O: new letter -> okay\n- W: new letter -> okay\n- D: new letter -> okay\n\nSo it\'s valid.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""CROWD"".\n\nBut note: we are testing O, W, D. If any of these are in the word, we\'ll get feedback.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""CROFT"" to test F and T.\n\nBut I think ""CROWD"" is fine.\n\nWe\'ll go with ""CROWD"".\n\nSo, the third guess is ""CROWD"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **C** and **R** are confirmed in positions 1 and 2 (✓).\n- **A**, **N**, **E**, **I**, **S**, and **P** are excluded (x).\n\nThe secret word is of the form: **C R _ _ _**, and the last three letters must be from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). No repeated letters have been indicated yet.\n\n### Strategy for the next guess:\n- Test new common letters in positions 3–5 to gather more information.\n- Prioritize high-frequency consonants (e.g., T, L, D, M) and vowels (O, U, Y).\n- Avoid excluded letters and reuse of C/R only in positions 1–2.\n\nI chose **CROWD** because:\n- It maintains ""CR"" in positions 1–2.\n- It tests three new letters: **O** (vowel), **W**, and **D**.\n- It uses only allowed letters (none excluded).\n- It is a valid English word.\n\nThis guess will help identify if O, W, or D are in the word and their positions.\n\n<guess>crowd</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: crisp -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) P(x)\nGuess 3: crowd -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for three guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(✓) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - This told us that the word starts with ""CR"", and A, N, E are not in the word.

2. ""crisp"": C(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) P(x)
   - This confirmed that the first two letters are correct (C and R), and I, S, P are not in the word.

3. ""crowd"": C(✓) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) D(x)
   - This tells us that O and W are in the word and in the correct positions (3 and 4 respectively), and D is not in the word.

So, from the feedback:
- The secret word is ""C R O W ?"" (since positions 1,2,3,4 are C, R, O, W respectively).
- The fifth letter is missing and must be one of the remaining letters.

Now, we know the word is ""C R O W ?"", and the fifth letter is not A, N, E, I, S, P, D (because D is now excluded).

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""CROW"" and the fifth letter is from the remaining alphabet.

The fifth letter must be one of: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But note: the word must be a valid English word.

What words start with ""CROW""? 
- CROWD? But we guessed that and D is excluded? The feedback for D was (x), meaning D is not in the word. So ""CROWD"" is incorrect because it has D.
- CROFT? But F and T are allowed? Yes, but we haven't tested F and T.
- CROWL? But L is allowed? Yes, but we don't have feedback on L.
- CROUP? But P is excluded.
- CROW? That's 4 letters. We need 5.

Actually, 5-letter words starting with ""CROW"":
- CROWD (invalid because D is excluded)
- CROFT (valid? Yes, meaning: a craft or a place)
- CROWL (valid? Meaning: to crowl, or a crowding? It's in some dictionaries)
- CROUP (invalid because P is excluded)
- CROW (too short)
- CROWs? But that would be C R O W S, but S is excluded.

So, the only common 5-letter word starting with ""CROW"" that doesn't use excluded letters is ""CROFT"".

But are there others?
- CROW? No, 4 letters.
- CROWS? 5 letters? But S is excluded and it would be C R O W S -> invalid because S is excluded.
- CROWD? Invalid because D is excluded.

So, ""CROFT"" is a candidate.

But we must check if F and T are not excluded? They are not in the excluded list.

Excluded: A, N, E, I, S, P, D.

F and T are not in that set.

Therefore, the secret word must be ""CROFT"".

But wait: the feedback for the third guess ""crowd"" had O(✓) and W(✓), meaning they are in the correct positions. And D(x) means D is not present.

So, the word is ""C R O W ?"" and the fifth letter is not D.

Now, ""CROFT"" has F and T.

But we haven't tested F and T? Actually, we haven't tested them, so they are possible.

But is there any other word? For example, ""CROWL"" has L, but we don't have feedback on L. However, we haven't tested L. But ""CROWL"" is a valid word? Yes, but we must check if L is allowed? Yes, because it's not excluded.

But we have to see if there are other possibilities.

What about ""CROUP""? P is excluded.

""CROOK"": but O is repeated? And K is new. But we have to check: ""CROOK"" starts with C R O O K. The third letter is O, but we already have O in the third position? Wait, no: in ""CROOK"", the third letter is O and the fourth is O? That would be two O's. But we don't know if O is repeated? The feedback from ""crowd"" only told us that O is in the third position and W in the fourth. It didn't say anything about O being repeated? Actually, the feedback doesn't indicate if a letter is repeated because we only guessed one of each.

But in ""crowd"", we had one O and one W. If the word had two O's, then the O we guessed in position 3 might be correct, but the fourth position might be O? We don't know.

But in ""CROOK"", the third letter is O and the fourth is O, so if the secret word is ""CROOK"", then when we guessed ""crowd"", the feedback for the fourth letter (W) was correct (✓) because W is in the fourth position? But in ""crowd"", we guessed W in the fourth position and it was correct. So that matches.

But the secret word has O in the third and fourth positions? That would be two O's.

But we don't have any feedback that says there are two O's. The feedback for ""crowd"" only told us that O is in the third position and W in the fourth. It didn't say anything about a second O.

So ""CROOK"" is a possibility? But wait, the third letter of ""CROOK"" is O, and we guessed O in the third position and it was correct. But the fourth letter is O? Then when we guessed ""crowd"", which has W in the fourth position, the feedback for the fourth letter was W(✓), meaning that W is in the correct position. But if the secret word has O in the fourth position, then the fourth letter of our guess is W, which is not O, so that would be wrong? But the secret word has O in the fourth? Then the fourth letter of the secret word is O, so when we guess W in the fourth, it should be marked as not correct? But the feedback was W(✓), meaning it is correct. So that implies that the fourth letter of the secret word is W. Therefore, the fourth letter must be W.

But if the secret word is ""CROOK"", then the fourth letter is O, so when we guessed ""crowd"", the fourth letter is W, which is not O, so that would be wrong. But the feedback for W was (✓), meaning that it is in the correct position. So that contradiction cannot be resolved.

Therefore, ""CROOK"" cannot be the word because it would require the fourth letter to be O, but we guessed W in the fourth and it was correct.

So, the fourth letter is not O. Therefore, the secret word is not ""CROOK"".

Similarly, we cannot have the third letter as O? Because then the word would be ""CROO?"" and the fifth letter would be O? But then the word is ""CROOO""? That doesn't sound right.

So, the third letter is not O. Therefore, the secret word has a third letter that is not O, and the fourth letter is W.

Now, what letters can the fifth be? It must be one of the remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need a word: ""C R O W ?""

Possible words:
- CROFT: C R O F T -> fifth letter T.
- CROWL: C R O W L -> fifth letter L.
- CROUP: invalid because P is excluded.
- CROWD: invalid because D is excluded.
- CROOK: would require the fourth letter to be O, but that contradicts the feedback for ""crowd"" because the fourth letter W is correct. So ""CROOK"" is impossible.

What about ""CROW""? Too short.

""CROGS""? But S is excluded.

""CROFT"" and ""CROWL"" are the main candidates.

But we have to see which one is more likely.

We also have to consider that we haven't tested F and T? Actually, we haven't tested them, so they are possible.

But note: in ""CROFT"", the fifth letter is F, which we haven't tested. Similarly, in ""CROWL"", it is L.

We can try ""CROFT"" to test F and T.

But we are on the fourth guess. We can try ""CROFT"".

If it's not ""CROFT"", then it must be ""CROWL"".

But let me check: are there any other words?

Another word: ""CROW""? No, 4 letters.

""CRUMB""? But that would be C R U M B, but we have O in the third position? No, in our case the third letter is O.

What about ""CROFT"" and ""CROWL"" are the only common ones.

We can also consider ""CROON""? But that has two O's? C R O O N -> but N is excluded. So no.

""CRONE""? But E is excluded.

So, it's between ""CROFT"" and ""CROWL"".

We can try ""CROFT"".

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. F and T are not excluded.

So, let's guess ""CROFT"".

But wait: what if the word is ""CROFT""? Then we get it.

But if it's ""CROWL"", then we get it wrong.

But we have two possibilities? Actually, yes, but we are on the fourth guess. We can try.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have one letter to test (the fifth) and we know the rest.

But we can also consider: we have not tested F, T, L, etc.

But we don't need to test for presence? Because we know the positions: the word is ""C R O W ?"". So if we guess ""CROFT"", we are testing F for the fifth position.

Similarly, if we guess ""CROWL"", we test L for the fifth.

But we don't have a word that tests both F and L? Because we are forced to use one of these words.

We can also consider ""CROW""? But that's 4 letters.

Or ""CROFT"" is the only common word that uses F and T.

But what about ""CROWL""? It is a word.

So, we have two candidates: ""CROFT"" and ""CROWL"".

We can try ""CROFT"".

But note: we have to make a guess. Let's choose ""CROFT"".

But wait: what if the word is ""CROFT""? Then we win.

If not, then it must be ""CROWL"".

But we have two guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess. We have two more guesses (5 and 6) if needed.

So, we can try ""CROFT"".

But let me see: is there a word that uses a different set of letters? For example, ""CROW"" is too short.

""CRUMB"" doesn't fit because the third letter must be O, not U.

So, we are left with ""CROFT"" and ""CROWL"".

I think ""CROFT"" is more common.

But to be safe, we can try ""CROFT"".

Alternatively, we can try a word that has a different fifth letter to test multiple options? But we can't because we are constrained to words starting with ""CROW"".

So, we must choose between ""CROFT"" and ""CROWL"".

We can also consider ""CROON""? But N is excluded.

So, I'll go with ""CROFT"".

But note: we are testing F and T. If the word is ""CROFT"", we win. If not, then it must be ""CROWL"".

But we have to make a guess.

We can also think: have we tested any letter besides C, R, O, W, D? No, so F and T are fresh.

So, let's guess ""CROFT"".

But wait: what if the word is ""CROWD""? But D is excluded, so no.

So, the guess is ""CROFT"".

But note: the feedback for ""crowd"" told us that O and W are in the correct positions. So if we guess ""CROFT"", we are maintaining the known letters and testing F and T.

If the word is ""CROFT"", we get it. If not, then it must be ""CROWL"".

So, we can do that.

But we are on the fourth guess. We have two more if needed.

So, I'll guess ""CROFT"".

But let me confirm: the word ""CROFT"" is valid.

So, the guess is ""CROFT"".

But note: we must output in the required format.

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses a letter we haven't tested? But we have to use one of these words.

So, we go with ""CROFT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **C** (position 1) and **R** (position 2) are confirmed (✓).
- **A**, **N**, **E**, **I**, **S**, and **P** are excluded (x) from Guess 1 and 2.
- **O** (position 3) and **W** (position 4) are confirmed (✓) from Guess 3.

The secret word must be **C R O W ?**, where the fifth letter is unknown but must be from the remaining alphabet (B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z). No repeated letters have been indicated.

### Analysis:
- The word is **C R O W ?**.
- Excluded letters: A, N, E, I, S, P, D.
- Possible fifth letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.
- Common words fitting this pattern:
  - **CROFT** (tests F and T).
  - **CROWL** (tests L and unknown fifth letter).
- **CROFT** is prioritized as it uses common letters (F and T) and is a more frequent word.

### Guess Strategy:
- Test **CROFT** to check if F (position 5) is correct.
- If correct, the game is won. If incorrect, the fifth letter must be one of the remaining options (e.g., L, M, T, etc.), but **CROFT** is the only common word testing F/T.

<guess>croft</guess>",croft,"We are given feedback for three guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(✓) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - This told us that the word starts with ""CR"", and A, N, E are not in the word.

2. ""crisp"": C(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) P(x)
   - This confirmed that the first two letters are correct (C and R), and I, S, P are not in the word.

3. ""crowd"": C(✓) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) D(x)
   - This tells us that O and W are in the word and in the correct positions (3 and 4 respectively), and D is not in the word.

So, from the feedback:
- The secret word is ""C R O W ?"" (since positions 1,2,3,4 are C, R, O, W respectively).
- The fifth letter is missing and must be one of the remaining letters.

Now, we know the word is ""C R O W ?"", and the fifth letter is not A, N, E, I, S, P, D (because D is now excluded).

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""CROW"" and the fifth letter is from the remaining alphabet.

The fifth letter must be one of: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But note: the word must be a valid English word.

What words start with ""CROW""? 
- CROWD? But we guessed that and D is excluded? The feedback for D was (x), meaning D is not in the word. So ""CROWD"" is incorrect because it has D.
- CROFT? But F and T are allowed? Yes, but we haven't tested F and T.
- CROWL? But L is allowed? Yes, but we don't have feedback on L.
- CROUP? But P is excluded.
- CROW? That's 4 letters. We need 5.

Actually, 5-letter words starting with ""CROW"":
- CROWD (invalid because D is excluded)
- CROFT (valid? Yes, meaning: a craft or a place)
- CROWL (valid? Meaning: to crowl, or a crowding? It's in some dictionaries)
- CROUP (invalid because P is excluded)
- CROW (too short)
- CROWs? But that would be C R O W S, but S is excluded.

So, the only common 5-letter word starting with ""CROW"" that doesn't use excluded letters is ""CROFT"".

But are there others?
- CROW? No, 4 letters.
- CROWS? 5 letters? But S is excluded and it would be C R O W S -> invalid because S is excluded.
- CROWD? Invalid because D is excluded.

So, ""CROFT"" is a candidate.

But we must check if F and T are not excluded? They are not in the excluded list.

Excluded: A, N, E, I, S, P, D.

F and T are not in that set.

Therefore, the secret word must be ""CROFT"".

But wait: the feedback for the third guess ""crowd"" had O(✓) and W(✓), meaning they are in the correct positions. And D(x) means D is not present.

So, the word is ""C R O W ?"" and the fifth letter is not D.

Now, ""CROFT"" has F and T.

But we haven't tested F and T? Actually, we haven't tested them, so they are possible.

But is there any other word? For example, ""CROWL"" has L, but we don't have feedback on L. However, we haven't tested L. But ""CROWL"" is a valid word? Yes, but we must check if L is allowed? Yes, because it's not excluded.

But we have to see if there are other possibilities.

What about ""CROUP""? P is excluded.

""CROOK"": but O is repeated? And K is new. But we have to check: ""CROOK"" starts with C R O O K. The third letter is O, but we already have O in the third position? Wait, no: in ""CROOK"", the third letter is O and the fourth is O? That would be two O's. But we don't know if O is repeated? The feedback from ""crowd"" only told us that O is in the third position and W in the fourth. It didn't say anything about O being repeated? Actually, the feedback doesn't indicate if a letter is repeated because we only guessed one of each.

But in ""crowd"", we had one O and one W. If the word had two O's, then the O we guessed in position 3 might be correct, but the fourth position might be O? We don't know.

But in ""CROOK"", the third letter is O and the fourth is O, so if the secret word is ""CROOK"", then when we guessed ""crowd"", the feedback for the fourth letter (W) was correct (✓) because W is in the fourth position? But in ""crowd"", we guessed W in the fourth position and it was correct. So that matches.

But the secret word has O in the third and fourth positions? That would be two O's.

But we don't have any feedback that says there are two O's. The feedback for ""crowd"" only told us that O is in the third position and W in the fourth. It didn't say anything about a second O.

So ""CROOK"" is a possibility? But wait, the third letter of ""CROOK"" is O, and we guessed O in the third position and it was correct. But the fourth letter is O? Then when we guessed ""crowd"", which has W in the fourth position, the feedback for the fourth letter was W(✓), meaning that W is in the correct position. But if the secret word has O in the fourth position, then the fourth letter of our guess is W, which is not O, so that would be wrong? But the secret word has O in the fourth? Then the fourth letter of the secret word is O, so when we guess W in the fourth, it should be marked as not correct? But the feedback was W(✓), meaning it is correct. So that implies that the fourth letter of the secret word is W. Therefore, the fourth letter must be W.

But if the secret word is ""CROOK"", then the fourth letter is O, so when we guessed ""crowd"", the fourth letter is W, which is not O, so that would be wrong. But the feedback for W was (✓), meaning that it is in the correct position. So that contradiction cannot be resolved.

Therefore, ""CROOK"" cannot be the word because it would require the fourth letter to be O, but we guessed W in the fourth and it was correct.

So, the fourth letter is not O. Therefore, the secret word is not ""CROOK"".

Similarly, we cannot have the third letter as O? Because then the word would be ""CROO?"" and the fifth letter would be O? But then the word is ""CROOO""? That doesn't sound right.

So, the third letter is not O. Therefore, the secret word has a third letter that is not O, and the fourth letter is W.

Now, what letters can the fifth be? It must be one of the remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need a word: ""C R O W ?""

Possible words:
- CROFT: C R O F T -> fifth letter T.
- CROWL: C R O W L -> fifth letter L.
- CROUP: invalid because P is excluded.
- CROWD: invalid because D is excluded.
- CROOK: would require the fourth letter to be O, but that contradicts the feedback for ""crowd"" because the fourth letter W is correct. So ""CROOK"" is impossible.

What about ""CROW""? Too short.

""CROGS""? But S is excluded.

""CROFT"" and ""CROWL"" are the main candidates.

But we have to see which one is more likely.

We also have to consider that we haven't tested F and T? Actually, we haven't tested them, so they are possible.

But note: in ""CROFT"", the fifth letter is F, which we haven't tested. Similarly, in ""CROWL"", it is L.

We can try ""CROFT"" to test F and T.

But we are on the fourth guess. We can try ""CROFT"".

If it's not ""CROFT"", then it must be ""CROWL"".

But let me check: are there any other words?

Another word: ""CROW""? No, 4 letters.

""CRUMB""? But that would be C R U M B, but we have O in the third position? No, in our case the third letter is O.

What about ""CROFT"" and ""CROWL"" are the only common ones.

We can also consider ""CROON""? But that has two O's? C R O O N -> but N is excluded. So no.

""CRONE""? But E is excluded.

So, it's between ""CROFT"" and ""CROWL"".

We can try ""CROFT"".

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. F and T are not excluded.

So, let's guess ""CROFT"".

But wait: what if the word is ""CROFT""? Then we get it.

But if it's ""CROWL"", then we get it wrong.

But we have two possibilities? Actually, yes, but we are on the fourth guess. We can try.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have one letter to test (the fifth) and we know the rest.

But we can also consider: we have not tested F, T, L, etc.

But we don't need to test for presence? Because we know the positions: the word is ""C R O W ?"". So if we guess ""CROFT"", we are testing F for the fifth position.

Similarly, if we guess ""CROWL"", we test L for the fifth.

But we don't have a word that tests both F and L? Because we are forced to use one of these words.

We can also consider ""CROW""? But that's 4 letters.

Or ""CROFT"" is the only common word that uses F and T.

But what about ""CROWL""? It is a word.

So, we have two candidates: ""CROFT"" and ""CROWL"".

We can try ""CROFT"".

But note: we have to make a guess. Let's choose ""CROFT"".

But wait: what if the word is ""CROFT""? Then we win.

If not, then it must be ""CROWL"".

But we have two guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess. We have two more guesses (5 and 6) if needed.

So, we can try ""CROFT"".

But let me see: is there a word that uses a different set of letters? For example, ""CROW"" is too short.

""CRUMB"" doesn't fit because the third letter must be O, not U.

So, we are left with ""CROFT"" and ""CROWL"".

I think ""CROFT"" is more common.

But to be safe, we can try ""CROFT"".

Alternatively, we can try a word that has a different fifth letter to test multiple options? But we can't because we are constrained to words starting with ""CROW"".

So, we must choose between ""CROFT"" and ""CROWL"".

We can also consider ""CROON""? But N is excluded.

So, I'll go with ""CROFT"".

But note: we are testing F and T. If the word is ""CROFT"", we win. If not, then it must be ""CROWL"".

But we have to make a guess.

We can also think: have we tested any letter besides C, R, O, W, D? No, so F and T are fresh.

So, let's guess ""CROFT"".

But wait: what if the word is ""CROWD""? But D is excluded, so no.

So, the guess is ""CROFT"".

But note: the feedback for ""crowd"" told us that O and W are in the correct positions. So if we guess ""CROFT"", we are maintaining the known letters and testing F and T.

If the word is ""CROFT"", we get it. If not, then it must be ""CROWL"".

So, we can do that.

But we are on the fourth guess. We have two more if needed.

So, I'll guess ""CROFT"".

But let me confirm: the word ""CROFT"" is valid.

So, the guess is ""CROFT"".

But note: we must output in the required format.

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses a letter we haven't tested? But we have to use one of these words.

So, we go with ""CROFT"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **C** (position 1) and **R** (position 2) are confirmed (✓).
- **A**, **N**, **E**, **I**, **S**, and **P** are excluded (x) from Guess 1 and 2.
- **O** (position 3) and **W** (position 4) are confirmed (✓) from Guess 3.

The secret word must be **C R O W ?**, where the fifth letter is unknown but must be from the remaining alphabet (B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z). No repeated letters have been indicated.

### Analysis:
- The word is **C R O W ?**.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C(✓) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)

 This means:
 - C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
 - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
 - A is not in the word.
 - N is not in the word.
 - E is not in the word.

 So, the secret word has the form: C R _ _ _

 We know that the letters A, N, and E are not in the word.

 Since the word is 5 letters and we have the first two letters as C and R, we need to guess the last three letters.

 We must avoid using the letters A, N, E.

 We also know that the word is a valid English word.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words that start with ""CR"" and do not contain A, N, or E.

 Some possibilities:
 - CROWD? But we don't know if D or W or other letters are present.
 - CROWN? Similarly, but we have to avoid E? Actually, CROWN has O and W, but no A, N, E? Let's check: C R O W N -> but N is not allowed (from feedback).

 Since N is not in the word, we cannot use N. Similarly, A and E are also out.

 So, we need a word that starts with ""CR"" and the remaining three letters are not A, N, E.

 Let's consider:
 - CROPS: C R O P S -> but we don't know if O, P, S are in the word? However, we haven't ruled them out.
 - CROWD: C R O W D -> again, no A, N, E.
 - CROWN: C R O W N -> has N, so not allowed.

 Another idea: What about ""CRUST""? But we have to check if U and S and T are allowed? We don't have any feedback against them.

 However, note that we have two correct letters already. We want to test as many new letters as possible to get more information.

 But we must remember that the word must start with ""CR"" and the last three letters must not be A, N, E.

 Let's list some words:
 - CRUST: C R U S T -> no A, N, E -> valid.
 - CRIMP: C R I M P -> valid.
 - CRUMB: C R U M B -> valid? But M and B are not excluded.
 - CRWTH: not common, and has W and H which are less common.

 We also know that the word does not contain A, N, E.

 We can choose a word that uses common letters and tests multiple possibilities.

 Since we have two fixed letters, we can try to cover more common consonants and vowels (but note that vowels are limited: we have already ruled out A and E, so the vowels left are I, O, U, and sometimes Y).

 Let's try to include a vowel in the third position? Or consonants.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRUST"" to test U, S, T.

 But note: we have three positions to test. We want to maximize information.

 Another common word: ""CRISP"" -> C R I S P -> tests I, S, P. However, we don't know if the word has I or not.

 However, we have to avoid A, N, E.

 Let's choose ""CRISP"" because it uses common letters and we haven't tested I, S, P.

 But wait: we already know that the word has C and R in the first two positions. So if we guess ""CRISP"", the feedback for the third, fourth, and fifth letters will tell us if they are correct or not.

 However, note that the word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any indication of that yet.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't repeat the letters we already know? But we are forced to use C and R in the first two positions.

 So, let's guess ""CRISP"".

 But note: the feedback for the first two letters was correct, so they are fixed. We are only testing the last three.

 However, we must consider that the word might have the letter we already know again? But we don't have any duplicates so far.

 But let's check: if we guess ""CRISP"", the feedback for C and R in the first two positions will be correct again, and then for I, S, P: they might be correct or not.

 But we don't have any reason to avoid using I, S, P.

 Alternatively, we could use a word that has a different set of letters to cover more ground? But we have only three positions to fill.

 Another idea: what about ""CRITH""? But that's not a common word.

 We should stick to common words.

 Let me think of more common words: 
 - CRUST (meaning: a crust over)
 - CRIMP (meaning: to compress)
 - CRISP (meaning: to make crisp)
 - CRUMB (meaning: to crumb)
 - CRAMP (meaning: to cramp)
 - CRIMP is already considered.

 But note: we have ruled out A, E, N. So the vowels that are left are I, O, U.

 We can try to use a word that has one of these vowels in the third position.

 I think ""CRISP"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and we haven't tested I, S, P.

 However, we must be cautious: the word might have the letter 'S' or 'P' or 'I'? We don't know.

 Alternatively, we could choose ""CRUST"" to test U, S, T.

 But let's see: we have 6 tries. We are on the second guess. We can try to cover more letters.

 Another common word: ""CROWD"" -> C R O W D -> tests O, W, D.

 But we don't know if O is in the word? We haven't tested O.

 We can also consider ""CROOK"" -> but that has two O's and we don't know if O is present.

 However, we are limited by the fact that we cannot use A, N, E.

 Let me list the available letters: we can use any letter except A, N, E.

 We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 The word ""CRISP"": tests I, S, P (and we already know C and R are present and fixed).
 The word ""CRUST"": tests U, S, T.

 Which one gives more information? Both test three new letters.

 But note: we have already fixed two letters. So we are only testing three letters.

 I think both are reasonable.

 However, we might consider that the word might have a double letter? But we don't have any indication.

 Let's choose ""CRISP"" because it uses more common consonants.

 So, my second guess: ""CRISP""

 But note: we must make sure that the word is valid. ""CRISP"" is a valid English word.

 Therefore, we guess ""CRISP"".

<guess>crisp</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓)
- **R** is correct and in position 2 (✓)
- **A**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word (x)

The secret word starts with ""CR"" and does not contain A, N, or E. We need to test new letters in positions 3, 4, and 5.

I chose **CRISP** as the next guess because:
- It maintains the fixed ""CR"" in positions 1 and 2.
- It tests three new common letters (I, S, P) in the remaining positions.
- It avoids the excluded letters (A, N, E).
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help identify if I, S, or P are in the word and their positions.

<guess>crisp</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: crisp -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) P(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(✓) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - This tells us that the word starts with ""CR"", and the letters A, N, E are not in the word.

2. ""crisp"": C(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) P(x)
   - This confirms that the first two letters are still correct (C and R). The third, fourth, and fifth letters are now marked as 'x', meaning that I, S, P are not in the word at all.

So, combining the information:
- The secret word is of the form: C R _ _ _
- Excluded letters: A, N, E, I, S, P
- We know that the word does not contain any of these: A, N, E, I, S, P.

Now, we need to think of a word that:
- Starts with ""CR""
- Does not contain A, N, E, I, S, P
- Uses only letters that are possible.

What letters are left? We have the entire alphabet minus the excluded ones.

Excluded: A, E, I, N, P, S. That's 6 letters.

Remaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we already have C and R in the word. Since C and R are fixed in positions 1 and 2, the remaining letters must be from the set above, and they can be repeated? But we don't have any indication of repetition so far.

We need to form a 5-letter word that starts with ""CR"" and uses only the remaining letters.

Let's brainstorm some words:
- ""CROWD"": But we have to check if W and D are allowed? Yes, because they are not excluded. However, we already excluded I, S, P. But note: ""CROWD"" has O and W, D. But we don't know if O is allowed? We haven't tested O. And W and D are new.

But wait: we must avoid the excluded letters: A, N, E, I, S, P. So ""CROWD"" uses W, D, O -> none of these are excluded? 
- W: not excluded -> okay
- D: not excluded -> okay
- O: not excluded -> okay

However, we already have two correct letters (C and R) and we are using them again? But that's okay because they are in the same positions.

But note: the feedback for the second guess told us that I, S, P are not in the word. So we can use W, D, O, etc.

But let's see other possibilities:

- ""CROFT"": C R O F T -> uses O, F, T. But F and T are not excluded? Yes.
- ""CROWL"": not common, and has L? But we don't know if L is allowed? L is not excluded.
- ""CROUP"": but that has P? P is excluded. So no.
- ""CROWD"": as above.

But we must also consider that the word must be valid.

Another idea: ""CRUMB"" -> but we have to check if U and M and B are allowed? Yes. But note: ""CRUMB"" has U and M, but we haven't tested U, M, B.

However, we already have two correct letters. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

But we have three positions to test (3,4,5). We should try to cover common letters.

Common letters left: T, O, L, U, D, W, M, etc.

We can try ""CROWD"" to test W, D, O.

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""CROWD"" is valid because it uses W, D, O, which are not excluded.

Alternatively, we can try ""CRUMB"" to test U, M, B.

But which one gives more information? Both test three new letters.

We might also consider ""CROOK"": C R O O K -> but has two O's? And K is new. But we don't know if O is repeated? It might be.

But let's look for words that use more common letters.

Another word: ""CROFT"" (meaning: a craft) -> C R O F T -> tests O, F, T.

Or ""CROWD"" (meaning: a crowd) -> C R O W D.

We can also consider ""CRUMB"" (meaning: to crumb) -> C R U M B -> tests U, M, B.

But note: we have already excluded I, S, P. So we are safe.

We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter that is in the word.

Since we have no information about the last three letters, we should choose a word that uses common letters.

Let's list the frequency of letters in English words (5-letter, starting with CR):

- T: very common
- O: common
- L: common
- U: common
- D: common
- M: common
- W: less common but we need to test it?

We can try to include T, O, L, U, D, M, etc.

But we have three positions to test. We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Possible words:
- ""CROFT"": tests O, F, T -> F is less common? But T and O are common.
- ""CROWD"": tests W, D, O -> W and D are medium frequency.
- ""CRUMB"": tests U, M, B -> U and M are common, B is less common.

Another word: ""CROUP"" is invalid because P is excluded.

What about ""CROWL""? Meaning: a crowl? Not common. But we can check: C R O W L -> tests O, W, L.

But ""CROWL"" is a valid word? Actually, it's not very common, but it is accepted in some dictionaries.

We can also consider ""CROOK"": C R O O K -> tests O (repeated) and K.

But we don't know if O is in the word. So testing O might be good.

Alternatively, we can try ""DROUGHT"" but that's 6 letters? No, we need 5.

Another idea: ""CROFT"" is a good candidate.

But let's think: we have to avoid A, N, E, I, S, P. So the word must be composed of letters from the set: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try ""CROWD"", but let's see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

What about ""CROFT""? It uses F, which is less common. But T and O are common.

Alternatively, ""CROOK"" has two O's and K.

But note: we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.

We can also consider ""CROWL"", but it's not very common.

Another common word: ""CROWD"" is acceptable.

But let me check: is ""CROWD"" a valid word? Yes.

We can also do ""CROUP"" but P is excluded.

How about ""CROWL""? It is a word (meaning: to crowl, or to fill with crowding? But it's rare). Alternatively, ""CROFT"" is more common.

But ""CROFT"" uses F, which we haven't tested. Similarly, ""CROWD"" uses W and D.

We might choose ""CROFT"" to test T and O? But F is less common.

Alternatively, we can try ""CROWD"" to test W and D.

But note: we have the letter O. It might be present.

Another word: ""CROOK"" -> C R O O K -> tests O (repeated) and K.

But we don't know if O is present.

We can also consider ""CROFT"" and ""CROWD"". I think ""CROWD"" is more common.

But let's look for a word that uses T, O, L, U, etc.

What about ""CULT""? But that's 4 letters. We need 5.

""CRUST"" is a common word: C R U S T -> but S is excluded (from the second feedback: S(x)). So we cannot use S.

Similarly, ""CRIMP"" has P? P is excluded.

So we must avoid S, P, etc.

Another word: ""CROWD"" is acceptable.

But let me confirm: ""CROWD"" uses W, D, O. None of these are excluded.

So I'll go with ""CROWD"".

But wait: what about ""CROUP""? No, P is excluded.

Or ""CROOK"": O is repeated, and K is new.

But ""CROWD"" is a good choice.

Alternatively, ""CROFT"" is also acceptable.

But let's choose ""CROWD"" because it tests W and D, which are medium frequency.

We can also consider ""CULTI"" but I is excluded and it's 5 letters? ""CULTI"" has I? I is excluded. So no.

Another word: ""CROWN"" -> but N is excluded? N is excluded from the first feedback. So we cannot use N.

Therefore, ""CROWN"" is invalid.

So, we are left with words like ""CROWD"", ""CROFT"", ""CRUMB"", ""CROOK"", etc.

I think ""CROWD"" is a good choice.

But let me see: we have to test the last three positions. We are testing W, D, O.

If we get feedback that W is not in the word, or D is not, or O is not, then we can eliminate them.

But we are on the third guess, so we can try.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has a vowel? The only vowel left is O? And U? But we don't have many vowels. The word must have at least one vowel? Not necessarily, but most words do. The vowels we have left are O, U, and sometimes Y.

We have O and U available.

So, let's choose ""CROWD"".

But note: we are not forced to use the fixed C and R? Actually, we are: because we know the first two letters are C and R, so we must use them.

So, I'll guess ""CROWD"".

But wait: what if the word has a repeated letter? We don't know. But we haven't seen any repetition so far.

So, the guess is ""CROWD"".

But let me double-check: the word must be 5 letters, starting with CR, and not containing A, N, E, I, S, P.

""CROWD"": C, R, O, W, D -> no excluded letters? 
- C: we know is in the word (but we are using it again in position 1, which is fixed) -> okay
- R: fixed in position 2 -> okay
- O: new letter -> okay
- W: new letter -> okay
- D: new letter -> okay

So it's valid.

Therefore, we guess ""CROWD"".

But note: we are testing O, W, D. If any of these are in the word, we'll get feedback.

Alternatively, we can try ""CROFT"" to test F and T.

But I think ""CROWD"" is fine.

We'll go with ""CROWD"".

So, the third guess is ""CROWD"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **C** and **R** are confirmed in positions 1 and 2 (✓).
- **A**, **N**, **E**, **I**, **S**, and **P** are excluded (x).

The secret word is of the form: **C R _ _ _**, and the last three letters must be from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). No repeated letters have been indicated yet.

### Strategy for the next guess:
- Test new common letters in positions 3–5 to gather more information.
- Prioritize high-frequency consonants (e.g., T, L, D, M) and vowels (O, U, Y).
- Avoid excluded letters and reuse of C/R only in positions 1–2.

I chose **CROWD** because:
- It maintains ""CR"" in positions 1–2.
- It tests three new letters: **O** (vowel), **W**, and **D**.
- It uses only allowed letters (none excluded).
- It is a valid English word.

This guess will help identify if O, W, or D are in the word and their positions.

<guess>crowd</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: crisp -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) P(x)
Guess 3: crowd -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) D(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for three guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(✓) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - This told us that the word starts with ""CR"", and A, N, E are not in the word.

2. ""crisp"": C(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) P(x)
   - This confirmed that the first two letters are correct (C and R), and I, S, P are not in the word.

3. ""crowd"": C(✓) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) D(x)
   - This tells us that O and W are in the word and in the correct positions (3 and 4 respectively), and D is not in the word.

So, from the feedback:
- The secret word is ""C R O W ?"" (since positions 1,2,3,4 are C, R, O, W respectively).
- The fifth letter is missing and must be one of the remaining letters.

Now, we know the word is ""C R O W ?"", and the fifth letter is not A, N, E, I, S, P, D (because D is now excluded).

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""CROW"" and the fifth letter is from the remaining alphabet.

The fifth letter must be one of: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But note: the word must be a valid English word.

What words start with ""CROW""? 
- CROWD? But we guessed that and D is excluded? The feedback for D was (x), meaning D is not in the word. So ""CROWD"" is incorrect because it has D.
- CROFT? But F and T are allowed? Yes, but we haven't tested F and T.
- CROWL? But L is allowed? Yes, but we don't have feedback on L.
- CROUP? But P is excluded.
- CROW? That's 4 letters. We need 5.

Actually, 5-letter words starting with ""CROW"":
- CROWD (invalid because D is excluded)
- CROFT (valid? Yes, meaning: a craft or a place)
- CROWL (valid? Meaning: to crowl, or a crowding? It's in some dictionaries)
- CROUP (invalid because P is excluded)
- CROW (too short)
- CROWs? But that would be C R O W S, but S is excluded.

So, the only common 5-letter word starting with ""CROW"" that doesn't use excluded letters is ""CROFT"".

But are there others?
- CROW? No, 4 letters.
- CROWS? 5 letters? But S is excluded and it would be C R O W S -> invalid because S is excluded.
- CROWD? Invalid because D is excluded.

So, ""CROFT"" is a candidate.

But we must check if F and T are not excluded? They are not in the excluded list.

Excluded: A, N, E, I, S, P, D.

F and T are not in that set.

Therefore, the secret word must be ""CROFT"".

But wait: the feedback for the third guess ""crowd"" had O(✓) and W(✓), meaning they are in the correct positions. And D(x) means D is not present.

So, the word is ""C R O W ?"" and the fifth letter is not D.

Now, ""CROFT"" has F and T.

But we haven't tested F and T? Actually, we haven't tested them, so they are possible.

But is there any other word? For example, ""CROWL"" has L, but we don't have feedback on L. However, we haven't tested L. But ""CROWL"" is a valid word? Yes, but we must check if L is allowed? Yes, because it's not excluded.

But we have to see if there are other possibilities.

What about ""CROUP""? P is excluded.

""CROOK"": but O is repeated? And K is new. But we have to check: ""CROOK"" starts with C R O O K. The third letter is O, but we already have O in the third position? Wait, no: in ""CROOK"", the third letter is O and the fourth is O? That would be two O's. But we don't know if O is repeated? The feedback from ""crowd"" only told us that O is in the third position and W in the fourth. It didn't say anything about O being repeated? Actually, the feedback doesn't indicate if a letter is repeated because we only guessed one of each.

But in ""crowd"", we had one O and one W. If the word had two O's, then the O we guessed in position 3 might be correct, but the fourth position might be O? We don't know.

But in ""CROOK"", the third letter is O and the fourth is O, so if the secret word is ""CROOK"", then when we guessed ""crowd"", the feedback for the fourth letter (W) was correct (✓) because W is in the fourth position? But in ""crowd"", we guessed W in the fourth position and it was correct. So that matches.

But the secret word has O in the third and fourth positions? That would be two O's.

But we don't have any feedback that says there are two O's. The feedback for ""crowd"" only told us that O is in the third position and W in the fourth. It didn't say anything about a second O.

So ""CROOK"" is a possibility? But wait, the third letter of ""CROOK"" is O, and we guessed O in the third position and it was correct. But the fourth letter is O? Then when we guessed ""crowd"", which has W in the fourth position, the feedback for the fourth letter was W(✓), meaning that W is in the correct position. But if the secret word has O in the fourth position, then the fourth letter of our guess is W, which is not O, so that would be wrong? But the secret word has O in the fourth? Then the fourth letter of the secret word is O, so when we guess W in the fourth, it should be marked as not correct? But the feedback was W(✓), meaning it is correct. So that implies that the fourth letter of the secret word is W. Therefore, the fourth letter must be W.

But if the secret word is ""CROOK"", then the fourth letter is O, so when we guessed ""crowd"", the fourth letter is W, which is not O, so that would be wrong. But the feedback for W was (✓), meaning that it is in the correct position. So that contradiction cannot be resolved.

Therefore, ""CROOK"" cannot be the word because it would require the fourth letter to be O, but we guessed W in the fourth and it was correct.

So, the fourth letter is not O. Therefore, the secret word is not ""CROOK"".

Similarly, we cannot have the third letter as O? Because then the word would be ""CROO?"" and the fifth letter would be O? But then the word is ""CROOO""? That doesn't sound right.

So, the third letter is not O. Therefore, the secret word has a third letter that is not O, and the fourth letter is W.

Now, what letters can the fifth be? It must be one of the remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need a word: ""C R O W ?""

Possible words:
- CROFT: C R O F T -> fifth letter T.
- CROWL: C R O W L -> fifth letter L.
- CROUP: invalid because P is excluded.
- CROWD: invalid because D is excluded.
- CROOK: would require the fourth letter to be O, but that contradicts the feedback for ""crowd"" because the fourth letter W is correct. So ""CROOK"" is impossible.

What about ""CROW""? Too short.

""CROGS""? But S is excluded.

""CROFT"" and ""CROWL"" are the main candidates.

But we have to see which one is more likely.

We also have to consider that we haven't tested F and T? Actually, we haven't tested them, so they are possible.

But note: in ""CROFT"", the fifth letter is F, which we haven't tested. Similarly, in ""CROWL"", it is L.

We can try ""CROFT"" to test F and T.

But we are on the fourth guess. We can try ""CROFT"".

If it's not ""CROFT"", then it must be ""CROWL"".

But let me check: are there any other words?

Another word: ""CROW""? No, 4 letters.

""CRUMB""? But that would be C R U M B, but we have O in the third position? No, in our case the third letter is O.

What about ""CROFT"" and ""CROWL"" are the only common ones.

We can also consider ""CROON""? But that has two O's? C R O O N -> but N is excluded. So no.

""CRONE""? But E is excluded.

So, it's between ""CROFT"" and ""CROWL"".

We can try ""CROFT"".

But note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. F and T are not excluded.

So, let's guess ""CROFT"".

But wait: what if the word is ""CROFT""? Then we get it.

But if it's ""CROWL"", then we get it wrong.

But we have two possibilities? Actually, yes, but we are on the fourth guess. We can try.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have one letter to test (the fifth) and we know the rest.

But we can also consider: we have not tested F, T, L, etc.

But we don't need to test for presence? Because we know the positions: the word is ""C R O W ?"". So if we guess ""CROFT"", we are testing F for the fifth position.

Similarly, if we guess ""CROWL"", we test L for the fifth.

But we don't have a word that tests both F and L? Because we are forced to use one of these words.

We can also consider ""CROW""? But that's 4 letters.

Or ""CROFT"" is the only common word that uses F and T.

But what about ""CROWL""? It is a word.

So, we have two candidates: ""CROFT"" and ""CROWL"".

We can try ""CROFT"".

But note: we have to make a guess. Let's choose ""CROFT"".

But wait: what if the word is ""CROFT""? Then we win.

If not, then it must be ""CROWL"".

But we have two guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess. We have two more guesses (5 and 6) if needed.

So, we can try ""CROFT"".

But let me see: is there a word that uses a different set of letters? For example, ""CROW"" is too short.

""CRUMB"" doesn't fit because the third letter must be O, not U.

So, we are left with ""CROFT"" and ""CROWL"".

I think ""CROFT"" is more common.

But to be safe, we can try ""CROFT"".

Alternatively, we can try a word that has a different fifth letter to test multiple options? But we can't because we are constrained to words starting with ""CROW"".

So, we must choose between ""CROFT"" and ""CROWL"".

We can also consider ""CROON""? But N is excluded.

So, I'll go with ""CROFT"".

But note: we are testing F and T. If the word is ""CROFT"", we win. If not, then it must be ""CROWL"".

But we have to make a guess.

We can also think: have we tested any letter besides C, R, O, W, D? No, so F and T are fresh.

So, let's guess ""CROFT"".

But wait: what if the word is ""CROWD""? But D is excluded, so no.

So, the guess is ""CROFT"".

But note: the feedback for ""crowd"" told us that O and W are in the correct positions. So if we guess ""CROFT"", we are maintaining the known letters and testing F and T.

If the word is ""CROFT"", we get it. If not, then it must be ""CROWL"".

So, we can do that.

But we are on the fourth guess. We have two more if needed.

So, I'll guess ""CROFT"".

But let me confirm: the word ""CROFT"" is valid.

So, the guess is ""CROFT"".

But note: we must output in the required format.

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses a letter we haven't tested? But we have to use one of these words.

So, we go with ""CROFT"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **C** (position 1) and **R** (position 2) are confirmed (✓).
- **A**, **N**, **E**, **I**, **S**, and **P** are excluded (x) from Guess 1 and 2.
- **O** (position 3) and **W** (position 4) are confirmed (✓) from Guess 3.

The secret word must be **C R O W ?**, where the fifth letter is unknown but must be from the remaining alphabet (B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z). No repeated letters have been indicated.

### Analysis:
- The word is **C R O W ?**.
- Excluded letters: A, N, E, I, S, P, D.
- Possible fifth letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.
- Common words fitting this pattern:
  - **CROFT** (tests F and T).
  - **CROWL** (tests L and unknown fifth letter).
- **CROFT** is prioritized as it uses common letters (F and T) and is a more frequent word.

### Guess Strategy:
- Test **CROFT** to check if F (position 5) is correct.
- If correct, the game is won. If incorrect, the fifth letter must be one of the remaining options (e.g., L, M, T, etc.), but **CROFT** is the only common word testing F/T.

But that\'s not a common word.\n\n We should stick to common words.\n\n Let me think of more common words: \n - CRUST (meaning: a crust over)\n - CRIMP (meaning: to compress)\n - CRISP (meaning: to make crisp)\n - CRUMB (meaning: to crumb)\n - CRAMP (meaning: to cramp)\n - CRIMP is already considered.\n\n But note: we have ruled out A, E, N. So the vowels that are left are I, O, U.\n\n We can try to use a word that has one of these vowels in the third position.\n\n I think ""CRISP"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and we haven\'t tested I, S, P.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the word might have the letter \'S\' or \'P\' or \'I\'? We don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we could choose ""CRUST"" to test U, S, T.\n\n But let\'s see: we have 6 tries. We are on the second guess. We can try to cover more letters.\n\n Another common word: ""CROWD"" -> C R O W D -> tests O, W, D.\n\n But we don\'t know if O is in the word? We haven\'t tested O.\n\n We can also consider ""CROOK"" -> but that has two O\'s and we don\'t know if O is present.\n\n However, we are limited by the fact that we cannot use A, N, E.\n\n Let me list the available letters: we can use any letter except A, N, E.\n\n We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n The word ""CRISP"": tests I, S, P (and we already know C and R are present and fixed).\n The word ""CRUST"": tests U, S, T.\n\n Which one gives more information? Both test three new letters.\n\n But note: we have already fixed two letters. So we are only testing three letters.\n\n I think both are reasonable.\n\n However, we might consider that the word might have a double letter? But we don\'t have any indication.\n\n Let\'s choose ""CRISP"" because it uses more common consonants.\n\n So, my second guess: ""CRISP""\n\n But note: we must make sure that the word is valid. ""CRISP"" is a valid English word.\n\n Therefore, we guess ""CRISP"".\n\n<guess>crisp</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C** is correct and in position 1 (✓)\n- **R** is correct and in position 2 (✓)\n- **A**, **N**, and **E** are not in the word (x)\n\nThe secret word starts with ""CR"" and does not contain A, N, or E. We need to test new letters in positions 3, 4, and 5.\n\nI chose **CRISP** as the next guess because:\n- It maintains the fixed ""CR"" in positions 1 and 2.\n- It tests three new common letters (I, S, P) in the remaining positions.\n- It avoids the excluded letters (A, N, E).\n- It is a valid English word.\n\nThis guess will help identify if I, S, or P are in the word and their positions.\n\n<guess>crisp</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: crisp -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) P(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n1. ""crane"": C(✓) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n   - This tells us that the word starts with ""CR"", and the letters A, N, E are not in the word.\n\n2. ""crisp"": C(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) P(x)\n   - This confirms that the first two letters are still correct (C and R). The third, fourth, and fifth letters are now marked as \'x\', meaning that I, S, P are not in the word at all.\n\nSo, combining the information:\n- The secret word is of the form: C R _ _ _\n- Excluded letters: A, N, E, I, S, P\n- We know that the word does not contain any of these: A, N, E, I, S, P.\n\nNow, we need to think of a word that:\n- Starts with ""CR""\n- Does not contain A, N, E, I, S, P\n- Uses only letters that are possible.\n\nWhat letters are left? We have the entire alphabet minus the excluded ones.\n\nExcluded: A, E, I, N, P, S. That\'s 6 letters.\n\nRemaining letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: we already have C and R in the word. Since C and R are fixed in positions 1 and 2, the remaining letters must be from the set above, and they can be repeated? But we don\'t have any indication of repetition so far.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that starts with ""CR"" and uses only the remaining letters.\n\nLet\'s brainstorm some words:\n- ""CROWD"": But we have to check if W and D are allowed? Yes, because they are not excluded. However, we already excluded I, S, P. But note: ""CROWD"" has O and W, D. But we don\'t know if O is allowed? We haven\'t tested O. And W and D are new.\n\nBut wait: we must avoid the excluded letters: A, N, E, I, S, P. So ""CROWD"" uses W, D, O -> none of these are excluded? \n- W: not excluded -> okay\n- D: not excluded -> okay\n- O: not excluded -> okay\n\nHowever, we already have two correct letters (C and R) and we are using them again? But that\'s okay because they are in the same positions.\n\nBut note: the feedback for the second guess told us that I, S, P are not in the word. So we can use W, D, O, etc.\n\nBut let\'s see other possibilities:\n\n- ""CROFT"": C R O F T -> uses O, F, T. But F and T are not excluded? Yes.\n- ""CROWL"": not common, and has L? But we don\'t know if L is allowed? L is not excluded.\n- ""CROUP"": but that has P? P is excluded. So no.\n- ""CROWD"": as above.\n\nBut we must also consider that the word must be valid.\n\nAnother idea: ""CRUMB"" -> but we have to check if U and M and B are allowed? Yes. But note: ""CRUMB"" has U and M, but we haven\'t tested U, M, B.\n\nHowever, we already have two correct letters. We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nBut we have three positions to test (3,4,5). We should try to cover common letters.\n\nCommon letters left: T, O, L, U, D, W, M, etc.\n\nWe can try ""CROWD"" to test W, D, O.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. ""CROWD"" is valid because it uses W, D, O, which are not excluded.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""CRUMB"" to test U, M, B.\n\nBut which one gives more information? Both test three new letters.\n\nWe might also consider ""CROOK"": C R O O K -> but has two O\'s? And K is new. But we don\'t know if O is repeated? It might be.\n\nBut let\'s look for words that use more common letters.\n\nAnother word: ""CROFT"" (meaning: a craft) -> C R O F T -> tests O, F, T.\n\nOr ""CROWD"" (meaning: a crowd) -> C R O W D.\n\nWe can also consider ""CRUMB"" (meaning: to crumb) -> C R U M B -> tests U, M, B.\n\nBut note: we have already excluded I, S, P. So we are safe.\n\nWe want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter that is in the word.\n\nSince we have no information about the last three letters, we should choose a word that uses common letters.\n\nLet\'s list the frequency of letters in English words (5-letter, starting with CR):\n\n- T: very common\n- O: common\n- L: common\n- U: common\n- D: common\n- M: common\n- W: less common but we need to test it?\n\nWe can try to include T, O, L, U, D, M, etc.\n\nBut we have three positions to test. We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""CROFT"": tests O, F, T -> F is less common? But T and O are common.\n- ""CROWD"": tests W, D, O -> W and D are medium frequency.\n- ""CRUMB"": tests U, M, B -> U and M are common, B is less common.\n\nAnother word: ""CROUP"" is invalid because P is excluded.\n\nWhat about ""CROWL""? Meaning: a crowl? Not common. But we can check: C R O W L -> tests O, W, L.\n\nBut ""CROWL"" is a valid word? Actually, it\'s not very common, but it is accepted in some dictionaries.\n\nWe can also consider ""CROOK"": C R O O K -> tests O (repeated) and K.\n\nBut we don\'t know if O is in the word. So testing O might be good.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""DROUGHT"" but that\'s 6 letters? No, we need 5.\n\nAnother idea: ""CROFT"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut let\'s think: we have to avoid A, N, E, I, S, P. So the word must be composed of letters from the set: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe can try ""CROWD"", but let\'s see if there is a word that uses more common letters.\n\nWhat about ""CROFT""? It uses F, which is less common. But T and O are common.\n\nAlternatively, ""CROOK"" has two O\'s and K.\n\nBut note: we have only 4 guesses left? Actually, we are on the third guess.\n\nWe can also consider ""CROWL"", but it\'s not very common.\n\nAnother common word: ""CROWD"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let me check: is ""CROWD"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nWe can also do ""CROUP"" but P is excluded.\n\nHow about ""CROWL""? It is a word (meaning: to crowl, or to fill with crowding? But it\'s rare). Alternatively, ""CROFT"" is more common.\n\nBut ""CROFT"" uses F, which we haven\'t tested. Similarly, ""CROWD"" uses W and D.\n\nWe might choose ""CROFT"" to test T and O? But F is less common.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""CROWD"" to test W and D.\n\nBut note: we have the letter O. It might be present.\n\nAnother word: ""CROOK"" -> C R O O K -> tests O (repeated) and K.\n\nBut we don\'t know if O is present.\n\nWe can also consider ""CROFT"" and ""CROWD"". I think ""CROWD"" is more common.\n\nBut let\'s look for a word that uses T, O, L, U, etc.\n\nWhat about ""CULT""? But that\'s 4 letters. We need 5.\n\n""CRUST"" is a common word: C R U S T -> but S is excluded (from the second feedback: S(x)). So we cannot use S.\n\nSimilarly, ""CRIMP"" has P? P is excluded.\n\nSo we must avoid S, P, etc.\n\nAnother word: ""CROWD"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let me confirm: ""CROWD"" uses W, D, O. None of these are excluded.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CROWD"".\n\nBut wait: what about ""CROUP""? No, P is excluded.\n\nOr ""CROOK"": O is repeated, and K is new.\n\nBut ""CROWD"" is a good choice.\n\nAlternatively, ""CROFT"" is also acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s choose ""CROWD"" because it tests W and D, which are medium frequency.\n\nWe can also consider ""CULTI"" but I is excluded and it\'s 5 letters? ""CULTI"" has I? I is excluded. So no.\n\nAnother word: ""CROWN"" -> but N is excluded? N is excluded from the first feedback. So we cannot use N.\n\nTherefore, ""CROWN"" is invalid.\n\nSo, we are left with words like ""CROWD"", ""CROFT"", ""CRUMB"", ""CROOK"", etc.\n\nI think ""CROWD"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see: we have to test the last three positions. We are testing W, D, O.\n\nIf we get feedback that W is not in the word, or D is not, or O is not, then we can eliminate them.\n\nBut we are on the third guess, so we can try.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has a vowel? The only vowel left is O? And U? But we don\'t have many vowels. The word must have at least one vowel? Not necessarily, but most words do. The vowels we have left are O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\nWe have O and U available.\n\nSo, let\'s choose ""CROWD"".\n\nBut note: we are not forced to use the fixed C and R? Actually, we are: because we know the first two letters are C and R, so we must use them.\n\nSo, I\'ll guess ""CROWD"".\n\nBut wait: what if the word has a repeated letter? We don\'t know. But we haven\'t seen any repetition so far.\n\nSo, the guess is ""CROWD"".\n\nBut let me double-check: the word must be 5 letters, starting with CR, and not containing A, N, E, I, S, P.\n\n""CROWD"": C, R, O, W, D -> no excluded letters? \n- C: we know is in the word (but we are using it again in position 1, which is fixed) -> okay\n- R: fixed in position 2 -> okay\n- O: new letter -> okay\n- W: new letter -> okay\n- D: new letter -> okay\n\nSo it\'s valid.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""CROWD"".\n\nBut note: we are testing O, W, D. If any of these are in the word, we\'ll get feedback.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""CROFT"" to test F and T.\n\nBut I think ""CROWD"" is fine.\n\nWe\'ll go with ""CROWD"".\n\nSo, the third guess is ""CROWD"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **C** and **R** are confirmed in positions 1 and 2 (✓).\n- **A**, **N**, **E**, **I**, **S**, and **P** are excluded (x).\n\nThe secret word is of the form: **C R _ _ _**, and the last three letters must be from the remaining alphabet (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z). No repeated letters have been indicated yet.\n\n### Strategy for the next guess:\n- Test new common letters in positions 3–5 to gather more information.\n- Prioritize high-frequency consonants (e.g., T, L, D, M) and vowels (O, U, Y).\n- Avoid excluded letters and reuse of C/R only in positions 1–2.\n\nI chose **CROWD** because:\n- It maintains ""CR"" in positions 1–2.\n- It tests three new letters: **O** (vowel), **W**, and **D**.\n- It uses only allowed letters (none excluded).\n- It is a valid English word.\n\nThis guess will help identify if O, W, or D are in the word and their positions.\n\n<guess>crowd</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: crisp -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) P(x)\nGuess 3: crowd -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for three guesses:\n1.

(since positions 1,2,3,4 are C, R, O, W respectively).\n- The fifth letter is missing and must be one of the remaining letters.\n\nNow, we know the word is ""C R O W ?"", and the fifth letter is not A, N, E, I, S, P, D (because D is now excluded).\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""CROW"" and the fifth letter is from the remaining alphabet.\n\nThe fifth letter must be one of: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: the word must be a valid English word.\n\nWhat words start with ""CROW""? \n- CROWD? But we guessed that and D is excluded? The feedback for D was (x), meaning D is not in the word. So ""CROWD"" is incorrect because it has D.\n- CROFT? But F and T are allowed? Yes, but we haven\'t tested F and T.\n- CROWL? But L is allowed? Yes, but we don\'t have feedback on L.\n- CROUP? But P is excluded.\n- CROW? That\'s 4 letters. We need 5.\n\nActually, 5-letter words starting with ""CROW"":\n- CROWD (invalid because D is excluded)\n- CROFT (valid? Yes, meaning: a craft or a place)\n- CROWL (valid? Meaning: to crowl, or a crowding? It\'s in some dictionaries)\n- CROUP (invalid because P is excluded)\n- CROW (too short)\n- CROWs? But that would be C R O W S, but S is excluded.\n\nSo, the only common 5-letter word starting with ""CROW"" that doesn\'t use excluded letters is ""CROFT"".\n\nBut are there others?\n- CROW? No, 4 letters.\n- CROWS? 5 letters? But S is excluded and it would be C R O W S -> invalid because S is excluded.\n- CROWD? Invalid because D is excluded.\n\nSo, ""CROFT"" is a candidate.\n\nBut we must check if F and T are not excluded? They are not in the excluded list.\n\nExcluded: A, N, E, I, S, P, D.\n\nF and T are not in that set.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must be ""CROFT"".\n\nBut wait: the feedback for the third guess ""crowd"" had O(✓) and W(✓), meaning they are in the correct positions. And D(x) means D is not present.\n\nSo, the word is ""C R O W ?"" and the fifth letter is not D.\n\nNow, ""CROFT"" has F and T.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested F and T? Actually, we haven\'t tested them, so they are possible.\n\nBut is there any other word? For example, ""CROWL"" has L, but we don\'t have feedback on L. However, we haven\'t tested L. But ""CROWL"" is a valid word? Yes, but we must check if L is allowed? Yes, because it\'s not excluded.\n\nBut we have to see if there are other possibilities.\n\nWhat about ""CROUP""? P is excluded.\n\n""CROOK"": but O is repeated? And K is new. But we have to check: ""CROOK"" starts with C R O O K. The third letter is O, but we already have O in the third position? Wait, no: in ""CROOK"", the third letter is O and the fourth is O? That would be two O\'s. But we don\'t know if O is repeated? The feedback from ""crowd"" only told us that O is in the third position and W in the fourth. It didn\'t say anything about O being repeated? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t indicate if a letter is repeated because we only guessed one of each.\n\nBut in ""crowd"", we had one O and one W. If the word had two O\'s, then the O we guessed in position 3 might be correct, but the fourth position might be O? We don\'t know.\n\nBut in ""CROOK"", the third letter is O and the fourth is O, so if the secret word is ""CROOK"", then when we guessed ""crowd"", the feedback for the fourth letter (W) was correct (✓) because W is in the fourth position? But in ""crowd"", we guessed W in the fourth position and it was correct. So that matches.\n\nBut the secret word has O in the third and fourth positions? That would be two O\'s.\n\nBut we don\'t have any feedback that says there are two O\'s. The feedback for ""crowd"" only told us that O is in the third position and W in the fourth. It didn\'t say anything about a second O.\n\nSo ""CROOK"" is a possibility? But wait, the third letter of ""CROOK"" is O, and we guessed O in the third position and it was correct. But the fourth letter is O? Then when we guessed ""crowd"", which has W in the fourth position, the feedback for the fourth letter was W(✓), meaning that W is in the correct position. But if the secret word has O in the fourth position, then the fourth letter of our guess is W, which is not O, so that would be wrong? But the secret word has O in the fourth? Then the fourth letter of the secret word is O, so when we guess W in the fourth, it should be marked as not correct? But the feedback was W(✓), meaning it is correct. So that implies that the fourth letter of the secret word is W. Therefore, the fourth letter must be W.\n\nBut if the secret word is ""CROOK"", then the fourth letter is O, so when we guessed ""crowd"", the fourth letter is W, which is not O, so that would be wrong. But the feedback for W was (✓), meaning that it is in the correct position. So that contradiction cannot be resolved.\n\nTherefore, ""CROOK"" cannot be the word because it would require the fourth letter to be O, but we guessed W in the fourth and it was correct.\n\nSo, the fourth letter is not O. Therefore, the secret word is not ""CROOK"".\n\nSimilarly, we cannot have the third letter as O? Because then the word would be ""CROO?"" and the fifth letter would be O? But then the word is ""CROOO""? That doesn\'t sound right.\n\nSo, the third letter is not O. Therefore, the secret word has a third letter that is not O, and the fourth letter is W.\n\nNow, what letters can the fifth be? It must be one of the remaining letters: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need a word: ""C R O W ?""\n\nPossible words:\n- CROFT: C R O F T -> fifth letter T.\n- CROWL: C R O W L -> fifth letter L.\n- CROUP: invalid because P is excluded.\n- CROWD: invalid because D is excluded.\n- CROOK: would require the fourth letter to be O, but that contradicts the feedback for ""crowd"" because the fourth letter W is correct. So ""CROOK"" is impossible.\n\nWhat about ""CROW""? Too short.\n\n""CROGS""? But S is excluded.\n\n""CROFT"" and ""CROWL"" are the main candidates.\n\nBut we have to see which one is more likely.\n\nWe also have to consider that we haven\'t tested F and T? Actually, we haven\'t tested them, so they are possible.\n\nBut note: in ""CROFT"", the fifth letter is F, which we haven\'t tested. Similarly, in ""CROWL"", it is L.\n\nWe can try ""CROFT"" to test F and T.\n\nBut we are on the fourth guess. We can try ""CROFT"".\n\nIf it\'s not ""CROFT"", then it must be ""CROWL"".\n\nBut let me check: are there any other words?\n\nAnother word: ""CROW""? No, 4 letters.\n\n""CRUMB""? But that would be C R U M B, but we have O in the third position? No, in our case the third letter is O.\n\nWhat about ""CROFT"" and ""CROWL"" are the only common ones.\n\nWe can also consider ""CROON""? But that has two O\'s? C R O O N -> but N is excluded. So no.\n\n""CRONE""? But E is excluded.\n\nSo, it\'s between ""CROFT"" and ""CROWL"".\n\nWe can try ""CROFT"".\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the excluded letters. F and T are not excluded.\n\nSo, let\'s guess ""CROFT"".\n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""CROFT""? Then we get it.\n\nBut if it\'s ""CROWL"", then we get it wrong.\n\nBut we have two possibilities? Actually, yes, but we are on the fourth guess. We can try.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have one letter to test (the fifth) and we know the rest.\n\nBut we can also consider: we have not tested F, T, L, etc.\n\nBut we don\'t need to test for presence? Because we know the positions: the word is ""C R O W ?"". So if we guess ""CROFT"", we are testing F for the fifth position.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""CROWL"", we test L for the fifth.\n\nBut we don\'t have a word that tests both F and L? Because we are forced to use one of these words.\n\nWe can also consider ""CROW""? But that\'s 4 letters.\n\nOr ""CROFT"" is the only common word that uses F and T.\n\nBut what about ""CROWL""? It is a word.\n\nSo, we have two candidates: ""CROFT"" and ""CROWL"".\n\nWe can try ""CROFT"".\n\nBut note: we have to make a guess. Let\'s choose ""CROFT"".\n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""CROFT""? Then we win.\n\nIf not, then it must be ""CROWL"".\n\nBut we have two guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess. We have two more guesses (5 and 6) if needed.\n\nSo, we can try ""CROFT"".\n\nBut let me see: is there a word that uses a different set of letters? For example, ""CROW"" is too short.\n\n""CRUMB"" doesn\'t fit because the third letter must be O, not U.\n\nSo, we are left with ""CROFT"" and ""CROWL"".\n\nI think ""CROFT"" is more common.\n\nBut to be safe, we can try ""CROFT"".\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has a different fifth letter to test multiple options? But we can\'t because we are constrained to words starting with ""CROW"".\n\nSo, we must choose between ""CROFT"" and ""CROWL"".\n\nWe can also consider ""CROON""? But N is excluded.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""CROFT"".\n\nBut note: we are testing F and T. If the word is ""CROFT"", we win. If not, then it must be ""CROWL"".\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nWe can also think: have we tested any letter besides C, R, O, W, D? No, so F and T are fresh.\n\nSo, let\'s guess ""CROFT"".\n\nBut wait: what if the word is ""CROWD""? But D is excluded, so no.\n\nSo, the guess is ""CROFT"".\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""crowd"" told us that O and W are in the correct positions. So if we guess ""CROFT"", we are maintaining the known letters and testing F and T.\n\nIf the word is ""CROFT"", we get it. If not, then it must be ""CROWL"".\n\nSo, we can do that.\n\nBut we are on the fourth guess. We have two more if needed.\n\nSo, I\'ll guess ""CROFT"".\n\nBut let me confirm: the word ""CROFT"" is valid.\n\nSo, the guess is ""CROFT"".\n\nBut note: we must output in the required format.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses a letter we haven\'t tested?

We are given feedback for four guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(✓) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
   - The word starts with ""CR"", and A, N, E are not in the word.

2. ""crisp"": C(✓) R(✓) I(x) S(x) P(x)
   - Confirms the first two letters, and I, S, P are not in the word.

3. ""crowd"": C(✓) R(✓) O(✓) W(✓) D(x)
   - Confirms the third and fourth letters as O and W, and D is not in the word.

4. ""croft"": C(✓) R(✓) O(✓) F(x) T(x)
   - Confirms the third and fourth letters (O and W), but F and T are not in the word.

So, the secret word is ""C R O W ?"" (positions 1,2,3,4 are C, R, O, W respectively) and the fifth letter is not A, N, E, I, S, P, D, F, T.

That leaves the possible letters for the fifth position from: B, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to find a valid 5-letter English word that fits ""CROW?"".

Let's list some options:
- ""CROWL"": uses L (which is not excluded) -> valid.
- Other possibilities: ""CROWD"" (invalid, D excluded), ""CROOK"" (O repeated, but we don't know if O is repeated? However, we have O in position 3, so a repeated O would be possible? But we haven't seen any repetition so far. But it's possible.

Wait, but in ""CROOK"", the third letter is O and the fourth is O? That would be two O's. But the feedback for ""crowd"" had O in the third position correct, but that doesn't tell us about a second O. However, we haven't tested O in the fourth position? But we guessed W in the fourth? So we don't know.

But in ""CROOK"", the fifth letter is K. And we haven't tested K.

But we also have to consider: if the word were ""CROOK"", then the fourth letter is O. But when we guessed ""crowd"", we had the fourth letter as W and it was correct. But if the secret word has O in the fourth position, then the fourth letter of our guess is W, which is not O, so that would be wrong? But the feedback for W was (✓), meaning it is in the correct position. So that implies that the fourth letter of the secret word is W. Therefore, if the secret word were ""CROOK"", then the fourth letter is O, so the fourth position of our guess (W) would be marked as wrong? But the feedback for W was (✓), so that means the fourth letter of the secret word is W, not O. So ""CROOK"" is impossible.

Therefore, the fifth letter cannot be O (because then the fourth letter would be O, which would conflict with our guess of W in the fourth).

So, the fifth letter is not O, and not any of the excluded letters.

Now, what letters are left? We have: B, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z for the fifth position.

Possible words:
- ""CROWL"": fifth letter L -> valid word.
- ""CROWD"": invalid (D excluded).
- ""CROOK"": invalid (because if the word had O in the fourth, then our guess of W in the fourth would be wrong, but the feedback for W would be (✓) only if it is in the correct position, which it is. But the fifth letter of ""CROOK"" is K, not O. So it's valid? But we haven't tested K.

But wait: ""CROOK"" is a valid word. And the fifth letter K is not excluded.

Similarly, ""CROWL"" has L.

Other possibilities? 
- ""CROW""? Too short.
- ""CROGS""? S excluded.
- ""CROFT"" we already tried, and F and T are excluded.

What about ""CROWL"" and ""CROOK"" are the only common ones.

But we also have ""CROWD"" but D is excluded.

Now, we have two candidates: ""CROWL"" and ""CROOK"".

But we need to distinguish between them.

We can try to guess ""CROWL"" to test L.

If we guess ""CROWL"":
- If the word is ""CROWL"", we win.
- If not, then it must be ""CROOK"" (since those are the only two common words).

But we have to make a guess.

We can also consider if there are other words? For example, ""CROW"" is too short. ""CROFT"" we tried and failed.

What about ""CROWL"" and ""CROOK"" are the only two.

We can try ""CROWL"" because L is a very common letter.

But note: we have not tested L or K.

So, we can guess ""CROWL"".

If it's not, then we know it must be ""CROOK"".

But we have two guesses left? Actually, we are on the fifth guess. We have one more guess (the sixth and final guess).

So, we can guess ""CROWL"".

But let me confirm: is there any other word? For example, ""CROW"" is 4 letters. ""CROTH"" is not a word.

So, it's between ""CROWL"" and ""CROOK"".

We can also think of ""CROW"" but that's 4 letters.

Another word: ""CROFT"" is out.

So, we'll go with ""CROWL"".

But note: we are testing L. If L is not in the word, then the word must be ""CROOK"".

Alternatively, we can try ""CROOK"" to test K.

But we don't have a preference.

We can choose ""CROWL"" because L is more common.

So, fifth guess: ""CROWL""

But let's see: if we guess ""CROWL"", and the word is ""CROOK"", then the feedback for L (if L is not in the word) would be (x), and for W we have (✓) because W is in the fourth position. But the fifth letter is K, which we haven't tested.

But the word ""CROOK"" has K, so if we guess ""CROWL"", the fifth letter L vs K.

If L is not in the word, then we know it's ""CROOK"".

But we have only one guess left? Actually, we are on the fifth guess, and we have one more if needed.

So, we can do that.

But note: we have to output the guess.

So, we guess ""CROWL"".

But wait: what if the word is ""CROWL""? Then we win.

If not, then we know it's ""CROOK"".

But we can also consider: is there a word that uses a letter that might help us distinguish? But we don't have any other information.

So, we go with ""CROWL"".

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple letters? But we are constrained to words starting with ""CROW"". There isn't a word that uses, say, H or G or U in the fifth position.

So, we must choose between the two.

We can also think: have we tested U? No, but we haven't tested L or K.

But we don't have a word that tests both? Because we are forced to use ""CROW"" as the first four letters.

So, we must pick one.

I think ""CROWL"" is a more common word? Or ""CROOK"".

But to be safe, we can try ""CROWL"".

So, the fifth guess is ""CROWL"".

But note: we must output in the required format.

So, we guess ""CROWL"".

But let me double-check: the word ""CROWL"" is valid.

So, <guess>crowl</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:
- **C** (position 1) and **R** (position 2) are confirmed (✓).
- **O** (position 3) and **W** (position 4) are confirmed (✓).
- **A**, **N**, **E**, **I**, **S**, **P**, **D**, **F**, and **T** are excluded (x) from the feedback.

The secret word must be **C R O W ?**, where the fifth letter is one of the remaining letters: B, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z. No repeated letters have been indicated.

### Analysis:
- The only common English words fitting this pattern are **CROWL** and **CROOK**.
- **CROWL** (meaning: to crowl or fill with crow) uses **L** (not excluded), while **CROOK** (meaning: to commit to something) uses **K** (not excluded).
- **CROWL** is prioritized as it tests a new letter (L) that is more common than K.

### Guess Strategy:
- Test **CROWL** to check if **L** is the fifth letter.
- If correct, the game is won. If incorrect, the fifth letter must be **K** (for **CROOK**), and we use the final guess.
