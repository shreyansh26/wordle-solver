We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 3rd letter)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The third letter is A.
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.
- Therefore, the word has A in the third position and does not contain C, R, N, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has A in the third position (to confirm or get more information, but we already know that, so we can use it to test other letters).
- Avoids the letters C, R, N, E.
- Includes other common letters to maximize information.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We can try a word that has A in the third position and uses other common letters.

Possible words: 
- _ _ A _ _

We avoid C, R, N, E.

Let's think of words that fit: 
- ""salad"" -> but has two A's and we don't know if A appears twice? But we have only one A confirmed so far, but it could appear again. However, we want to test new letters.
- ""plate"" -> but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word).
- ""blast"" -> has S, T, and A in the third position. Also, avoids C, R, N, E.

But let's check the letters: 
- B, L, A, S, T -> all new, and we know A is in the word (but we don't know if it's in the third position again? Actually, we do know it's in the third position, so we can use it to test other positions).

However, note that the feedback for A was correct and in position 3, so in our next guess, we should keep A in position 3 to avoid wasting a letter? But we can also try to put A in a different position to see if it appears elsewhere? But the feedback only showed one A (and it was in position 3). However, it's possible that there is another A? But we don't have information about that.

But since we have limited tries, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we know A is in position 3, we can focus on the other positions.

We can try a word that has A in the third position and uses other common consonants and vowels.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern _ _ A _ _ and do not contain C, R, N, E.

Some options:
- ""shake"" -> S, H, A, K, E -> but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So invalid.
- ""shape"" -> S, H, A, P, E -> E is not allowed.
- ""spalt"" -> not common, and has T? But let's avoid uncommon words.
- ""stale"" -> has E and E is not allowed.

We must avoid E, so let's avoid words with E.

Try ""balmy"": B, A, L, M, Y -> but the pattern is _ _ A _ _, so the third letter must be A. In ""balmy"", the A is in the second position? No, balmy: B-A-L-M-Y -> so the A is in position 2, but we need it in position 3. So that doesn't work.

We need the third letter to be A: so the word must be [letter1][letter2]A[letter4][letter5].

Let me try ""plate"" but we know E is not allowed.

Avoid E.

Try ""blast"": B-L-A-S-T -> this fits: B (1), L (2), A (3), S (4), T (5). And it doesn't contain C, R, N, E.

But note: we have already used the letter A and we know it's in the word, but we are going to use it again in the same position? That's okay because we can confirm it's fixed. Actually, we can keep A in the third position to get information about the other positions.

So, ""blast"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""drama"" -> D-R-A-M-A -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word). So we cannot use R.

Another: ""pasta"" -> P-A-S-T-A -> but the A is in position 2 and 5? We need the third letter to be A. In ""pasta"", the third letter is S? Actually, p-a-s-t-a: positions: 1:p, 2:a, 3:s, 4:t, 5:a -> so the third letter is S, not A. So that doesn't work.

We need the third letter to be A.

Another word: ""magma"" -> M-A-G-M-A -> again, A is in position 2 and 5, and third is G. Not A.

Try ""tabby"" -> T-A-B-B-Y -> A in position 2, not 3.

We need the pattern to have A in the third position.

Let me think of words: 
- ""quack"" -> but Q and C? C is not allowed and also Q is uncommon.
- ""track"" -> T-R-A-C-K -> but R and C are not allowed.

We must avoid R and C.

Another: ""whack"" -> W-H-A-C-K -> C is not allowed.

""black"" -> B-L-A-C-K -> C is not allowed.

""flack"" -> F-L-A-C-K -> C not allowed.

""stack"" -> S-T-A-C-K -> C not allowed.

""tramp"" -> T-R-A-M-P -> R is not allowed.

""camp"" -> only 4 letters? No, we need 5.

""dance"" -> D-A-N-C-E -> but N and E are not allowed.

""latch"" -> L-A-T-C-H -> A is in position 2, and C is not allowed.

""patch"" -> P-A-T-C-H -> A in position 2, and C not allowed.

We are having trouble finding words without C, R, N, E.

Let me try ""salad"": S-A-L-A-D -> but A is in position 2 and 4? We need the third letter to be A. In ""salad"", the third letter is L? Actually, s-a-l-a-d: positions: 1:s, 2:a, 3:l, 4:a, 5:D -> so the third letter is L, not A.

We need the third letter to be A.

Another word: ""salsa"" -> S-A-L-S-A -> third letter is L? Actually: S (1), A (2), L (3), S (4), A (5) -> so the third letter is L, not A.

We need the third letter to be A.

Try ""papal"" -> P-A-P-A-L -> third letter is P? Actually: P (1), A (2), P (3), A (4), L (5) -> so the third letter is P, not A.

I'm struggling. Let me think of words that have A as the third letter.

Some words: 
- ""drama"" -> but R is not allowed and also the pattern: D (1), R (2), A (3), M (4), A (5) -> but R is not allowed and also we have two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, we cannot use R.

- ""flamingo"" -> 6 letters, too long.

- ""large"" -> L-A-R-G-E -> but R and E are not allowed.

- ""mango"" -> M-A-N-G-O -> N is not allowed.

- ""tango"" -> T-A-N-G-O -> N is not allowed.

- ""balsa"" -> B-A-L-S-A -> third letter is L? Actually: B (1), A (2), L (3), S (4), A (5) -> so the third letter is L, not A.

I need to recall that the word is [1][2]A[4][5]. So the first two letters are before A, and the last two are after.

Let me try ""focal"" -> but F-O-C-A-L -> C is not allowed and also the pattern: F (1), O (2), C (3), A (4), L (5) -> so the third letter is C, not A.

Another: ""local"" -> L-O-C-A-L -> C not allowed.

""vocal"" -> V-O-C-A-L -> C not allowed.

""agape"" -> A-G-A-P-E -> but the third letter is A? Actually: A (1), G (2), A (3), P (4), E (5) -> but E is not allowed.

""aback"" -> A-B-A-C-K -> C not allowed and also A is in position 1 and 3? But we know A is in position 3, but we don't know about position 1. However, we cannot use C.

""adage"" -> A-D-A-G-E -> E not allowed.

""alate"" -> A-L-A-T-E -> E not allowed.

""amaze"" -> A-M-A-Z-E -> E not allowed.

""apace"" -> A-P-A-C-E -> C and E not allowed.

""arise"" -> A-R-I-S-E -> R and E not allowed.

""ashen"" -> A-S-H-E-N -> E and N not allowed.

""atoll"" -> A-T-O-L-L -> but the third letter is O? Actually: A (1), T (2), O (3), L (4), L (5) -> so the third letter is O, not A.

We need the third letter to be A.

Let me think of words that end with A? But no, the third letter is A, so the word has the form ...A..

For example: 
- ""panda"" -> P-A-N-D-A -> but N is not allowed and also A is in position 2 and 5? But we need the third letter to be A, so in ""panda"": P(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), A(5) -> so the third letter is N, not A.

""bajra"" -> B-A-J-R-A -> R not allowed and also A in position 2 and 5.

I'm not finding common words. Let me try ""magma"" again? No, that has G in position 3.

Another idea: ""quaff"" -> Q-U-A-F-F -> but Q and U? And F is repeated. But the pattern: Q(1), U(2), A(3), F(4), F(5). But we don't know if Q, U, F are in the word. However, we are avoiding R, C, N, E, but Q and U are new.

But ""quaff"" is a word? Yes, meaning to drink heartily.

But we have two F's? That might be okay.

But let's see: we are going to guess ""quaff"", which has Q, U, A (in position 3), F, F.

We are testing Q, U, F. But F is repeated, so we are testing F twice? That might not be efficient.

Alternatively, ""salty"": S-A-L-T-Y -> but A is in position 2, not 3.

We need the third letter to be A.

Try ""tameless"" -> 6 letters.

""pawky"" -> P-A-W-K-Y -> A in position 2.

I think I need to look for words that have A as the third letter.

Some words: 
- ""drama"" is not because of R and also pattern mismatch.

Actually, ""drama"" has A in position 2.

Another: ""kayak"" -> K-A-Y-A-K -> A in position 2 and 4? And third is Y. Not A.

""mokar"" -> not a common word, and R not allowed.

""vodka"" -> V-O-D-K-A -> O in position 2, D in position 3? No, V(1), O(2), D(3), K(4), A(5) -> so the third letter is D, not A.

I'm stuck. Let me try a different approach: we know the word has A in the third position, and doesn't have C, R, N, E.

So, the word is: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4][letter5]

We have to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses letters that are not C, R, N, E.

We can try ""blast"" as I thought earlier: B-L-A-S-T -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T. This uses B, L, S, T, and we know A is in the word (and in position 3).

But we don't know if B, L, S, T are in the word. So it's a good candidate.

Another word: ""plant"" -> but N is not allowed.

""slant"" -> S-L-A-N-T -> N is not allowed.

""blast"" is acceptable because it doesn't contain C, R, N, E.

Another word: ""spalt"" -> S-P-A-L-T -> but the pattern: S(1), P(2), A(3), L(4), T(5). This avoids C, R, N, E. And it's a valid word (meaning to fry quickly in a little hot fat room).

But ""spalt"" is not very common. ""Blast"" is more common.

""blast"" is a common word.

Another: ""staid"" -> S-T-A-I-D -> but the pattern: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), D(5). This avoids C, R, N, E. And it's common.

""staid"" and ""blast"" are both options.

But ""blast"" has the advantage of having more common letters? Or ""staid"" has S, T, A, I, D.

We haven't tried S, T, L, I, D, B, etc.

I think ""staid"" is a good choice because it has S, T, I, D which are common.

But note: we are going to get feedback on each position.

Alternatively, we can try ""pasta"" but it doesn't have A in the third position.

Another word: ""manta"" -> M-A-N-T-A -> N not allowed.

""pate"" -> too short.

""latke"" -> L-A-T-K-E -> E not allowed.

""baton"" -> B-A-T-O-N -> N not allowed.

""fatal"" -> F-A-T-A-L -> A in position 2 and 4? And third is T. Not A.

""salad"" -> S-A-L-A-D -> A in position 2 and 4.

I think ""staid"" is a good choice: S-T-A-I-D.

But let's confirm: S (1), T (2), A (3), I (4), D (5). And it doesn't contain C, R, N, E.

So, I'll go with ""staid"".

Another common word: ""shalt"" -> S-H-A-L-T -> H and L are new. But ""shalt"" is an archaic word, might not be in the word list.

""blast"" is more common.

But ""staid"" is common.

We can also consider ""skate"": S-K-A-T-E -> but E is not allowed.

""slate"" -> S-L-A-T-E -> E not allowed.

""plate"" -> P-L-A-T-E -> E not allowed.

So, ""staid"" seems good.

But what about ""daisy""? D-A-I-S-Y -> A in position 2.

We need the third letter to be A.

Another word: ""basis"" -> B-A-S-I-S -> A in position 2.

""asis"" -> A-S-S-I-S -> A in position 1.

I think ""staid"" is a solid choice.

But let's try to get more common letters. ""Staid"" uses S, T, A, I, D.

We can also consider ""tamed"": T-A-M-E-D -> E not allowed.

""amed"" -> too short.

""lapel"" -> L-A-P-E-L -> E not allowed.

""papal"" -> P-A-P-A-L -> A in position 2 and 4.

I think ""staid"" is acceptable.

But wait, we have to avoid E, so ""staid"" is valid.

Another word: ""sulfa"" -> S-U-L-F-A -> but the pattern: S(1), U(2), L(3), F(4), A(5) -> so the third letter is L, not A.

Not matching.

""tappa"" -> T-A-P-P-A -> A in position 2 and 5, and third is P.

Not A.

So, I think ""staid"" is a good guess.

But let me check if there are other words.

""quake"" -> Q-U-A-K-E -> E not allowed.

""quake"" -> Q-U-A-K-E -> E not allowed.

""raze"" -> R and E not allowed.

""vague"" -> V-A-G-U-E -> E not allowed.

So, ""staid"" seems like a good option.

We can also consider ""daisy"" but A is not in position 3.

Another: ""hasps"" -> H-A-S-P-S -> A in position 2.

I think we should go with ""staid"".

But note: we are going to get feedback on S, T, I, D in positions 1,2,4,5, and we know A is correct in position 3.

So, let's guess ""staid"".

But wait, what about ""blast""? It has B, L, S, T. We haven't tried these.

""blast"" is more common than ""staid""? Actually, ""blast"" is very common.

But ""staid"" is also common.

Another word: ""swamp"" -> S-W-A-M-P -> avoids C, R, N, E. And it's a common word.

""swamp"": S(1), W(2), A(3), M(4), P(5). This uses S, W, M, P.

We haven't tried S, W, M, P.

But ""swamp"" has W and M, which are less common than S and T? But we don't know.

""staid"" has S, T, I, D.

I think both are reasonable.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

""blast"" uses B, L, S, T.
""staid"" uses S, T, I, D.

L is more common than I and D? Actually, L is very common.

But we can also consider ""shalt"" but it's less common.

Another word: ""smack"" -> S-M-A-C-K -> C is not allowed.

""spack"" -> not a word.

""stack"" -> S-T-A-C-K -> C not allowed.

So, I think ""blast"" is a good choice because it has common letters: B, L, S, T.

But we already know A is in the word and in position 3, so we are using that to our advantage.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have A in the third position? But that would be inefficient because we know A is in position 3. So we should keep it there to get information about the other positions.

Therefore, I choose ""blast"".

But let me confirm: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

""blast"" is a valid English word.

So, our next guess: ""blast"".

We'll get feedback on B, L, S, T.

If we get a ✓ on any of these, we know that letter is in the correct position.

If we get a -, then that letter is in the word but wrong position.

If x, then not in the word.

So, let's go with ""blast"".

But note: we are not forced to keep A in the third position? Actually, we can, and it's beneficial because if the word has A in position 3, we get confirmation, but we already know that. So we can use that to test other positions.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has A in a different position to see if there is another A? But we don't have information about that. However, if we put A in a different position, and if there is another A, we might get a '-' or '✓' for that position? But we don't know.

But since we have limited guesses, it's better to keep A in position 3 and test the other positions with new letters.

So, I'll go with ""blast"".

But wait, what about ""salty""? It has A in position 2, so we cannot use it because we need A in position 3.

Similarly, ""tango"" has A in position 2.

So, ""blast"" is good.

Another word: ""plaid"" -> P-L-A-I-D -> avoids C, R, N, E. And it's common.

""plaid"": P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), D(5). This uses P, L, I, D.

We haven't tried P, L, I, D.

But ""blast"" has S and T, which are very common.

I think ""blast"" is fine.

So, our next guess: ""blast"".

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

""staid"" has S, T, I, D.

""staid"" is more common than ""blast""? Actually, both are common.

But ""blast"" has L, which is very common, and S and T.

We can also consider ""shalt"", but it's less common.

Another: ""spalt"" is not common.

I think ""blast"" is a good choice.

So, I'll go with ""blast"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, and E are not in the word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter, marked with ""✓"").

This means:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ A _ _`.
- The word does not contain C, R, N, or E.
- We should avoid these letters in the next guess and focus on testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, D, B, P) to maximize information about the other positions.

For the next guess:
- We must keep A in the 3rd position to leverage the known correct letter.
- We should choose a word that uses new, common letters to test positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.
- ""blast"" fits the pattern (`B L A S T`), avoids forbidden letters, and tests common consonants (B, L, S, T).

<guess>blast</guess>",blast,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 3rd letter)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The third letter is A.
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.
- Therefore, the word has A in the third position and does not contain C, R, N, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has A in the third position (to confirm or get more information, but we already know that, so we can use it to test other letters).
- Avoids the letters C, R, N, E.
- Includes other common letters to maximize information.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We can try a word that has A in the third position and uses other common letters.

Possible words: 
- _ _ A _ _

We avoid C, R, N, E.

Let's think of words that fit: 
- ""salad"" -> but has two A's and we don't know if A appears twice? But we have only one A confirmed so far, but it could appear again. However, we want to test new letters.
- ""plate"" -> but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word).
- ""blast"" -> has S, T, and A in the third position. Also, avoids C, R, N, E.

But let's check the letters: 
- B, L, A, S, T -> all new, and we know A is in the word (but we don't know if it's in the third position again? Actually, we do know it's in the third position, so we can use it to test other positions).

However, note that the feedback for A was correct and in position 3, so in our next guess, we should keep A in position 3 to avoid wasting a letter? But we can also try to put A in a different position to see if it appears elsewhere? But the feedback only showed one A (and it was in position 3). However, it's possible that there is another A? But we don't have information about that.

But since we have limited tries, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we know A is in position 3, we can focus on the other positions.

We can try a word that has A in the third position and uses other common consonants and vowels.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern _ _ A _ _ and do not contain C, R, N, E.

Some options:
- ""shake"" -> S, H, A, K, E -> but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So invalid.
- ""shape"" -> S, H, A, P, E -> E is not allowed.
- ""spalt"" -> not common, and has T? But let's avoid uncommon words.
- ""stale"" -> has E and E is not allowed.

We must avoid E, so let's avoid words with E.

Try ""balmy"": B, A, L, M, Y -> but the pattern is _ _ A _ _, so the third letter must be A. In ""balmy"", the A is in the second position? No, balmy: B-A-L-M-Y -> so the A is in position 2, but we need it in position 3. So that doesn't work.

We need the third letter to be A: so the word must be [letter1][letter2]A[letter4][letter5].

Let me try ""plate"" but we know E is not allowed.

Avoid E.

Try ""blast"": B-L-A-S-T -> this fits: B (1), L (2), A (3), S (4), T (5). And it doesn't contain C, R, N, E.

But note: we have already used the letter A and we know it's in the word, but we are going to use it again in the same position? That's okay because we can confirm it's fixed. Actually, we can keep A in the third position to get information about the other positions.

So, ""blast"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""drama"" -> D-R-A-M-A -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word). So we cannot use R.

Another: ""pasta"" -> P-A-S-T-A -> but the A is in position 2 and 5? We need the third letter to be A. In ""pasta"", the third letter is S? Actually, p-a-s-t-a: positions: 1:p, 2:a, 3:s, 4:t, 5:a -> so the third letter is S, not A. So that doesn't work.

We need the third letter to be A.

Another word: ""magma"" -> M-A-G-M-A -> again, A is in position 2 and 5, and third is G. Not A.

Try ""tabby"" -> T-A-B-B-Y -> A in position 2, not 3.

We need the pattern to have A in the third position.

Let me think of words: 
- ""quack"" -> but Q and C? C is not allowed and also Q is uncommon.
- ""track"" -> T-R-A-C-K -> but R and C are not allowed.

We must avoid R and C.

Another: ""whack"" -> W-H-A-C-K -> C is not allowed.

""black"" -> B-L-A-C-K -> C is not allowed.

""flack"" -> F-L-A-C-K -> C not allowed.

""stack"" -> S-T-A-C-K -> C not allowed.

""tramp"" -> T-R-A-M-P -> R is not allowed.

""camp"" -> only 4 letters? No, we need 5.

""dance"" -> D-A-N-C-E -> but N and E are not allowed.

""latch"" -> L-A-T-C-H -> A is in position 2, and C is not allowed.

""patch"" -> P-A-T-C-H -> A in position 2, and C not allowed.

We are having trouble finding words without C, R, N, E.

Let me try ""salad"": S-A-L-A-D -> but A is in position 2 and 4? We need the third letter to be A. In ""salad"", the third letter is L? Actually, s-a-l-a-d: positions: 1:s, 2:a, 3:l, 4:a, 5:D -> so the third letter is L, not A.

We need the third letter to be A.

Another word: ""salsa"" -> S-A-L-S-A -> third letter is L? Actually: S (1), A (2), L (3), S (4), A (5) -> so the third letter is L, not A.

We need the third letter to be A.

Try ""papal"" -> P-A-P-A-L -> third letter is P? Actually: P (1), A (2), P (3), A (4), L (5) -> so the third letter is P, not A.

I'm struggling. Let me think of words that have A as the third letter.

Some words: 
- ""drama"" -> but R is not allowed and also the pattern: D (1), R (2), A (3), M (4), A (5) -> but R is not allowed and also we have two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, we cannot use R.

- ""flamingo"" -> 6 letters, too long.

- ""large"" -> L-A-R-G-E -> but R and E are not allowed.

- ""mango"" -> M-A-N-G-O -> N is not allowed.

- ""tango"" -> T-A-N-G-O -> N is not allowed.

- ""balsa"" -> B-A-L-S-A -> third letter is L? Actually: B (1), A (2), L (3), S (4), A (5) -> so the third letter is L, not A.

I need to recall that the word is [1][2]A[4][5]. So the first two letters are before A, and the last two are after.

Let me try ""focal"" -> but F-O-C-A-L -> C is not allowed and also the pattern: F (1), O (2), C (3), A (4), L (5) -> so the third letter is C, not A.

Another: ""local"" -> L-O-C-A-L -> C not allowed.

""vocal"" -> V-O-C-A-L -> C not allowed.

""agape"" -> A-G-A-P-E -> but the third letter is A? Actually: A (1), G (2), A (3), P (4), E (5) -> but E is not allowed.

""aback"" -> A-B-A-C-K -> C not allowed and also A is in position 1 and 3? But we know A is in position 3, but we don't know about position 1. However, we cannot use C.

""adage"" -> A-D-A-G-E -> E not allowed.

""alate"" -> A-L-A-T-E -> E not allowed.

""amaze"" -> A-M-A-Z-E -> E not allowed.

""apace"" -> A-P-A-C-E -> C and E not allowed.

""arise"" -> A-R-I-S-E -> R and E not allowed.

""ashen"" -> A-S-H-E-N -> E and N not allowed.

""atoll"" -> A-T-O-L-L -> but the third letter is O? Actually: A (1), T (2), O (3), L (4), L (5) -> so the third letter is O, not A.

We need the third letter to be A.

Let me think of words that end with A? But no, the third letter is A, so the word has the form ...A..

For example: 
- ""panda"" -> P-A-N-D-A -> but N is not allowed and also A is in position 2 and 5? But we need the third letter to be A, so in ""panda"": P(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), A(5) -> so the third letter is N, not A.

""bajra"" -> B-A-J-R-A -> R not allowed and also A in position 2 and 5.

I'm not finding common words. Let me try ""magma"" again? No, that has G in position 3.

Another idea: ""quaff"" -> Q-U-A-F-F -> but Q and U? And F is repeated. But the pattern: Q(1), U(2), A(3), F(4), F(5). But we don't know if Q, U, F are in the word. However, we are avoiding R, C, N, E, but Q and U are new.

But ""quaff"" is a word? Yes, meaning to drink heartily.

But we have two F's? That might be okay.

But let's see: we are going to guess ""quaff"", which has Q, U, A (in position 3), F, F.

We are testing Q, U, F. But F is repeated, so we are testing F twice? That might not be efficient.

Alternatively, ""salty"": S-A-L-T-Y -> but A is in position 2, not 3.

We need the third letter to be A.

Try ""tameless"" -> 6 letters.

""pawky"" -> P-A-W-K-Y -> A in position 2.

I think I need to look for words that have A as the third letter.

Some words: 
- ""drama"" is not because of R and also pattern mismatch.

Actually, ""drama"" has A in position 2.

Another: ""kayak"" -> K-A-Y-A-K -> A in position 2 and 4? And third is Y. Not A.

""mokar"" -> not a common word, and R not allowed.

""vodka"" -> V-O-D-K-A -> O in position 2, D in position 3? No, V(1), O(2), D(3), K(4), A(5) -> so the third letter is D, not A.

I'm stuck. Let me try a different approach: we know the word has A in the third position, and doesn't have C, R, N, E.

So, the word is: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4][letter5]

We have to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses letters that are not C, R, N, E.

We can try ""blast"" as I thought earlier: B-L-A-S-T -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T. This uses B, L, S, T, and we know A is in the word (and in position 3).

But we don't know if B, L, S, T are in the word. So it's a good candidate.

Another word: ""plant"" -> but N is not allowed.

""slant"" -> S-L-A-N-T -> N is not allowed.

""blast"" is acceptable because it doesn't contain C, R, N, E.

Another word: ""spalt"" -> S-P-A-L-T -> but the pattern: S(1), P(2), A(3), L(4), T(5). This avoids C, R, N, E. And it's a valid word (meaning to fry quickly in a little hot fat room).

But ""spalt"" is not very common. ""Blast"" is more common.

""blast"" is a common word.

Another: ""staid"" -> S-T-A-I-D -> but the pattern: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), D(5). This avoids C, R, N, E. And it's common.

""staid"" and ""blast"" are both options.

But ""blast"" has the advantage of having more common letters? Or ""staid"" has S, T, A, I, D.

We haven't tried S, T, L, I, D, B, etc.

I think ""staid"" is a good choice because it has S, T, I, D which are common.

But note: we are going to get feedback on each position.

Alternatively, we can try ""pasta"" but it doesn't have A in the third position.

Another word: ""manta"" -> M-A-N-T-A -> N not allowed.

""pate"" -> too short.

""latke"" -> L-A-T-K-E -> E not allowed.

""baton"" -> B-A-T-O-N -> N not allowed.

""fatal"" -> F-A-T-A-L -> A in position 2 and 4? And third is T. Not A.

""salad"" -> S-A-L-A-D -> A in position 2 and 4.

I think ""staid"" is a good choice: S-T-A-I-D.

But let's confirm: S (1), T (2), A (3), I (4), D (5). And it doesn't contain C, R, N, E.

So, I'll go with ""staid"".

Another common word: ""shalt"" -> S-H-A-L-T -> H and L are new. But ""shalt"" is an archaic word, might not be in the word list.

""blast"" is more common.

But ""staid"" is common.

We can also consider ""skate"": S-K-A-T-E -> but E is not allowed.

""slate"" -> S-L-A-T-E -> E not allowed.

""plate"" -> P-L-A-T-E -> E not allowed.

So, ""staid"" seems good.

But what about ""daisy""? D-A-I-S-Y -> A in position 2.

We need the third letter to be A.

Another word: ""basis"" -> B-A-S-I-S -> A in position 2.

""asis"" -> A-S-S-I-S -> A in position 1.

I think ""staid"" is a solid choice.

But let's try to get more common letters. ""Staid"" uses S, T, A, I, D.

We can also consider ""tamed"": T-A-M-E-D -> E not allowed.

""amed"" -> too short.

""lapel"" -> L-A-P-E-L -> E not allowed.

""papal"" -> P-A-P-A-L -> A in position 2 and 4.

I think ""staid"" is acceptable.

But wait, we have to avoid E, so ""staid"" is valid.

Another word: ""sulfa"" -> S-U-L-F-A -> but the pattern: S(1), U(2), L(3), F(4), A(5) -> so the third letter is L, not A.

Not matching.

""tappa"" -> T-A-P-P-A -> A in position 2 and 5, and third is P.

Not A.

So, I think ""staid"" is a good guess.

But let me check if there are other words.

""quake"" -> Q-U-A-K-E -> E not allowed.

""quake"" -> Q-U-A-K-E -> E not allowed.

""raze"" -> R and E not allowed.

""vague"" -> V-A-G-U-E -> E not allowed.

So, ""staid"" seems like a good option.

We can also consider ""daisy"" but A is not in position 3.

Another: ""hasps"" -> H-A-S-P-S -> A in position 2.

I think we should go with ""staid"".

But note: we are going to get feedback on S, T, I, D in positions 1,2,4,5, and we know A is correct in position 3.

So, let's guess ""staid"".

But wait, what about ""blast""? It has B, L, S, T. We haven't tried these.

""blast"" is more common than ""staid""? Actually, ""blast"" is very common.

But ""staid"" is also common.

Another word: ""swamp"" -> S-W-A-M-P -> avoids C, R, N, E. And it's a common word.

""swamp"": S(1), W(2), A(3), M(4), P(5). This uses S, W, M, P.

We haven't tried S, W, M, P.

But ""swamp"" has W and M, which are less common than S and T? But we don't know.

""staid"" has S, T, I, D.

I think both are reasonable.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

""blast"" uses B, L, S, T.
""staid"" uses S, T, I, D.

L is more common than I and D? Actually, L is very common.

But we can also consider ""shalt"" but it's less common.

Another word: ""smack"" -> S-M-A-C-K -> C is not allowed.

""spack"" -> not a word.

""stack"" -> S-T-A-C-K -> C not allowed.

So, I think ""blast"" is a good choice because it has common letters: B, L, S, T.

But we already know A is in the word and in position 3, so we are using that to our advantage.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have A in the third position? But that would be inefficient because we know A is in position 3. So we should keep it there to get information about the other positions.

Therefore, I choose ""blast"".

But let me confirm: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

""blast"" is a valid English word.

So, our next guess: ""blast"".

We'll get feedback on B, L, S, T.

If we get a ✓ on any of these, we know that letter is in the correct position.

If we get a -, then that letter is in the word but wrong position.

If x, then not in the word.

So, let's go with ""blast"".

But note: we are not forced to keep A in the third position? Actually, we can, and it's beneficial because if the word has A in position 3, we get confirmation, but we already know that. So we can use that to test other positions.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has A in a different position to see if there is another A? But we don't have information about that. However, if we put A in a different position, and if there is another A, we might get a '-' or '✓' for that position? But we don't know.

But since we have limited guesses, it's better to keep A in position 3 and test the other positions with new letters.

So, I'll go with ""blast"".

But wait, what about ""salty""? It has A in position 2, so we cannot use it because we need A in position 3.

Similarly, ""tango"" has A in position 2.

So, ""blast"" is good.

Another word: ""plaid"" -> P-L-A-I-D -> avoids C, R, N, E. And it's common.

""plaid"": P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), D(5). This uses P, L, I, D.

We haven't tried P, L, I, D.

But ""blast"" has S and T, which are very common.

I think ""blast"" is fine.

So, our next guess: ""blast"".

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

""staid"" has S, T, I, D.

""staid"" is more common than ""blast""? Actually, both are common.

But ""blast"" has L, which is very common, and S and T.

We can also consider ""shalt"", but it's less common.

Another: ""spalt"" is not common.

I think ""blast"" is a good choice.

So, I'll go with ""blast"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, and E are not in the word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter, marked with ""✓"").

This means:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ A _ _`.
- The word does not contain C, R, N, or E.
- We should avoid these letters in the next guess and focus on testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, D, B, P) to maximize information about the other positions.

For the next guess:
- We must keep A in the 3rd position to leverage the known correct letter.
- We should choose a word that uses new, common letters to test positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.
- ""blast"" fits the pattern (`B L A S T`), avoids forbidden letters, and tests common consonants (B, L, S, T).",Guess 2: blast -> FEEDBACK: B(-) L(x) A(✓) S(-) T(x),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 07 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so A is the 3rd letter)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The third letter is A.
- The letters C, R, N, E are not in the word at all.
- Therefore, the word has A in the third position and does not contain C, R, N, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Has A in the third position (to confirm or get more information, but we already know that, so we can use it to test other letters).
- Avoids the letters C, R, N, E.
- Includes other common letters to maximize information.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

We can try a word that has A in the third position and uses other common letters.

Possible words: 
- _ _ A _ _

We avoid C, R, N, E.

Let's think of words that fit: 
- ""salad"" -> but has two A's and we don't know if A appears twice? But we have only one A confirmed so far, but it could appear again. However, we want to test new letters.
- ""plate"" -> but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word).
- ""blast"" -> has S, T, and A in the third position. Also, avoids C, R, N, E.

But let's check the letters: 
- B, L, A, S, T -> all new, and we know A is in the word (but we don't know if it's in the third position again? Actually, we do know it's in the third position, so we can use it to test other positions).

However, note that the feedback for A was correct and in position 3, so in our next guess, we should keep A in position 3 to avoid wasting a letter? But we can also try to put A in a different position to see if it appears elsewhere? But the feedback only showed one A (and it was in position 3). However, it's possible that there is another A? But we don't have information about that.

But since we have limited tries, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since we know A is in position 3, we can focus on the other positions.

We can try a word that has A in the third position and uses other common consonants and vowels.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern _ _ A _ _ and do not contain C, R, N, E.

Some options:
- ""shake"" -> S, H, A, K, E -> but E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So invalid.
- ""shape"" -> S, H, A, P, E -> E is not allowed.
- ""spalt"" -> not common, and has T? But let's avoid uncommon words.
- ""stale"" -> has E and E is not allowed.

We must avoid E, so let's avoid words with E.

Try ""balmy"": B, A, L, M, Y -> but the pattern is _ _ A _ _, so the third letter must be A. In ""balmy"", the A is in the second position? No, balmy: B-A-L-M-Y -> so the A is in position 2, but we need it in position 3. So that doesn't work.

We need the third letter to be A: so the word must be [letter1][letter2]A[letter4][letter5].

Let me try ""plate"" but we know E is not allowed.

Avoid E.

Try ""blast"": B-L-A-S-T -> this fits: B (1), L (2), A (3), S (4), T (5). And it doesn't contain C, R, N, E.

But note: we have already used the letter A and we know it's in the word, but we are going to use it again in the same position? That's okay because we can confirm it's fixed. Actually, we can keep A in the third position to get information about the other positions.

So, ""blast"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""drama"" -> D-R-A-M-A -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word). So we cannot use R.

Another: ""pasta"" -> P-A-S-T-A -> but the A is in position 2 and 5? We need the third letter to be A. In ""pasta"", the third letter is S? Actually, p-a-s-t-a: positions: 1:p, 2:a, 3:s, 4:t, 5:a -> so the third letter is S, not A. So that doesn't work.

We need the third letter to be A.

Another word: ""magma"" -> M-A-G-M-A -> again, A is in position 2 and 5, and third is G. Not A.

Try ""tabby"" -> T-A-B-B-Y -> A in position 2, not 3.

We need the pattern to have A in the third position.

Let me think of words: 
- ""quack"" -> but Q and C? C is not allowed and also Q is uncommon.
- ""track"" -> T-R-A-C-K -> but R and C are not allowed.

We must avoid R and C.

Another: ""whack"" -> W-H-A-C-K -> C is not allowed.

""black"" -> B-L-A-C-K -> C is not allowed.

""flack"" -> F-L-A-C-K -> C not allowed.

""stack"" -> S-T-A-C-K -> C not allowed.

""tramp"" -> T-R-A-M-P -> R is not allowed.

""camp"" -> only 4 letters? No, we need 5.

""dance"" -> D-A-N-C-E -> but N and E are not allowed.

""latch"" -> L-A-T-C-H -> A is in position 2, and C is not allowed.

""patch"" -> P-A-T-C-H -> A in position 2, and C not allowed.

We are having trouble finding words without C, R, N, E.

Let me try ""salad"": S-A-L-A-D -> but A is in position 2 and 4? We need the third letter to be A. In ""salad"", the third letter is L? Actually, s-a-l-a-d: positions: 1:s, 2:a, 3:l, 4:a, 5:D -> so the third letter is L, not A.

We need the third letter to be A.

Another word: ""salsa"" -> S-A-L-S-A -> third letter is L? Actually: S (1), A (2), L (3), S (4), A (5) -> so the third letter is L, not A.

We need the third letter to be A.

Try ""papal"" -> P-A-P-A-L -> third letter is P? Actually: P (1), A (2), P (3), A (4), L (5) -> so the third letter is P, not A.

I'm struggling. Let me think of words that have A as the third letter.

Some words: 
- ""drama"" -> but R is not allowed and also the pattern: D (1), R (2), A (3), M (4), A (5) -> but R is not allowed and also we have two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, we cannot use R.

- ""flamingo"" -> 6 letters, too long.

- ""large"" -> L-A-R-G-E -> but R and E are not allowed.

- ""mango"" -> M-A-N-G-O -> N is not allowed.

- ""tango"" -> T-A-N-G-O -> N is not allowed.

- ""balsa"" -> B-A-L-S-A -> third letter is L? Actually: B (1), A (2), L (3), S (4), A (5) -> so the third letter is L, not A.

I need to recall that the word is [1][2]A[4][5]. So the first two letters are before A, and the last two are after.

Let me try ""focal"" -> but F-O-C-A-L -> C is not allowed and also the pattern: F (1), O (2), C (3), A (4), L (5) -> so the third letter is C, not A.

Another: ""local"" -> L-O-C-A-L -> C not allowed.

""vocal"" -> V-O-C-A-L -> C not allowed.

""agape"" -> A-G-A-P-E -> but the third letter is A? Actually: A (1), G (2), A (3), P (4), E (5) -> but E is not allowed.

""aback"" -> A-B-A-C-K -> C not allowed and also A is in position 1 and 3? But we know A is in position 3, but we don't know about position 1. However, we cannot use C.

""adage"" -> A-D-A-G-E -> E not allowed.

""alate"" -> A-L-A-T-E -> E not allowed.

""amaze"" -> A-M-A-Z-E -> E not allowed.

""apace"" -> A-P-A-C-E -> C and E not allowed.

""arise"" -> A-R-I-S-E -> R and E not allowed.

""ashen"" -> A-S-H-E-N -> E and N not allowed.

""atoll"" -> A-T-O-L-L -> but the third letter is O? Actually: A (1), T (2), O (3), L (4), L (5) -> so the third letter is O, not A.

We need the third letter to be A.

Let me think of words that end with A? But no, the third letter is A, so the word has the form ...A..

For example: 
- ""panda"" -> P-A-N-D-A -> but N is not allowed and also A is in position 2 and 5? But we need the third letter to be A, so in ""panda"": P(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), A(5) -> so the third letter is N, not A.

""bajra"" -> B-A-J-R-A -> R not allowed and also A in position 2 and 5.

I'm not finding common words. Let me try ""magma"" again? No, that has G in position 3.

Another idea: ""quaff"" -> Q-U-A-F-F -> but Q and U? And F is repeated. But the pattern: Q(1), U(2), A(3), F(4), F(5). But we don't know if Q, U, F are in the word. However, we are avoiding R, C, N, E, but Q and U are new.

But ""quaff"" is a word? Yes, meaning to drink heartily.

But we have two F's? That might be okay.

But let's see: we are going to guess ""quaff"", which has Q, U, A (in position 3), F, F.

We are testing Q, U, F. But F is repeated, so we are testing F twice? That might not be efficient.

Alternatively, ""salty"": S-A-L-T-Y -> but A is in position 2, not 3.

We need the third letter to be A.

Try ""tameless"" -> 6 letters.

""pawky"" -> P-A-W-K-Y -> A in position 2.

I think I need to look for words that have A as the third letter.

Some words: 
- ""drama"" is not because of R and also pattern mismatch.

Actually, ""drama"" has A in position 2.

Another: ""kayak"" -> K-A-Y-A-K -> A in position 2 and 4? And third is Y. Not A.

""mokar"" -> not a common word, and R not allowed.

""vodka"" -> V-O-D-K-A -> O in position 2, D in position 3? No, V(1), O(2), D(3), K(4), A(5) -> so the third letter is D, not A.

I'm stuck. Let me try a different approach: we know the word has A in the third position, and doesn't have C, R, N, E.

So, the word is: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4][letter5]

We have to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses letters that are not C, R, N, E.

We can try ""blast"" as I thought earlier: B-L-A-S-T -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T. This uses B, L, S, T, and we know A is in the word (and in position 3).

But we don't know if B, L, S, T are in the word. So it's a good candidate.

Another word: ""plant"" -> but N is not allowed.

""slant"" -> S-L-A-N-T -> N is not allowed.

""blast"" is acceptable because it doesn't contain C, R, N, E.

Another word: ""spalt"" -> S-P-A-L-T -> but the pattern: S(1), P(2), A(3), L(4), T(5). This avoids C, R, N, E. And it's a valid word (meaning to fry quickly in a little hot fat room).

But ""spalt"" is not very common. ""Blast"" is more common.

""blast"" is a common word.

Another: ""staid"" -> S-T-A-I-D -> but the pattern: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), D(5). This avoids C, R, N, E. And it's common.

""staid"" and ""blast"" are both options.

But ""blast"" has the advantage of having more common letters? Or ""staid"" has S, T, A, I, D.

We haven't tried S, T, L, I, D, B, etc.

I think ""staid"" is a good choice because it has S, T, I, D which are common.

But note: we are going to get feedback on each position.

Alternatively, we can try ""pasta"" but it doesn't have A in the third position.

Another word: ""manta"" -> M-A-N-T-A -> N not allowed.

""pate"" -> too short.

""latke"" -> L-A-T-K-E -> E not allowed.

""baton"" -> B-A-T-O-N -> N not allowed.

""fatal"" -> F-A-T-A-L -> A in position 2 and 4? And third is T. Not A.

""salad"" -> S-A-L-A-D -> A in position 2 and 4.

I think ""staid"" is a good choice: S-T-A-I-D.

But let's confirm: S (1), T (2), A (3), I (4), D (5). And it doesn't contain C, R, N, E.

So, I'll go with ""staid"".

Another common word: ""shalt"" -> S-H-A-L-T -> H and L are new. But ""shalt"" is an archaic word, might not be in the word list.

""blast"" is more common.

But ""staid"" is common.

We can also consider ""skate"": S-K-A-T-E -> but E is not allowed.

""slate"" -> S-L-A-T-E -> E not allowed.

""plate"" -> P-L-A-T-E -> E not allowed.

So, ""staid"" seems good.

But what about ""daisy""? D-A-I-S-Y -> A in position 2.

We need the third letter to be A.

Another word: ""basis"" -> B-A-S-I-S -> A in position 2.

""asis"" -> A-S-S-I-S -> A in position 1.

I think ""staid"" is a solid choice.

But let's try to get more common letters. ""Staid"" uses S, T, A, I, D.

We can also consider ""tamed"": T-A-M-E-D -> E not allowed.

""amed"" -> too short.

""lapel"" -> L-A-P-E-L -> E not allowed.

""papal"" -> P-A-P-A-L -> A in position 2 and 4.

I think ""staid"" is acceptable.

But wait, we have to avoid E, so ""staid"" is valid.

Another word: ""sulfa"" -> S-U-L-F-A -> but the pattern: S(1), U(2), L(3), F(4), A(5) -> so the third letter is L, not A.

Not matching.

""tappa"" -> T-A-P-P-A -> A in position 2 and 5, and third is P.

Not A.

So, I think ""staid"" is a good guess.

But let me check if there are other words.

""quake"" -> Q-U-A-K-E -> E not allowed.

""quake"" -> Q-U-A-K-E -> E not allowed.

""raze"" -> R and E not allowed.

""vague"" -> V-A-G-U-E -> E not allowed.

So, ""staid"" seems like a good option.

We can also consider ""daisy"" but A is not in position 3.

Another: ""hasps"" -> H-A-S-P-S -> A in position 2.

I think we should go with ""staid"".

But note: we are going to get feedback on S, T, I, D in positions 1,2,4,5, and we know A is correct in position 3.

So, let's guess ""staid"".

But wait, what about ""blast""? It has B, L, S, T. We haven't tried these.

""blast"" is more common than ""staid""? Actually, ""blast"" is very common.

But ""staid"" is also common.

Another word: ""swamp"" -> S-W-A-M-P -> avoids C, R, N, E. And it's a common word.

""swamp"": S(1), W(2), A(3), M(4), P(5). This uses S, W, M, P.

We haven't tried S, W, M, P.

But ""swamp"" has W and M, which are less common than S and T? But we don't know.

""staid"" has S, T, I, D.

I think both are reasonable.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

""blast"" uses B, L, S, T.
""staid"" uses S, T, I, D.

L is more common than I and D? Actually, L is very common.

But we can also consider ""shalt"" but it's less common.

Another word: ""smack"" -> S-M-A-C-K -> C is not allowed.

""spack"" -> not a word.

""stack"" -> S-T-A-C-K -> C not allowed.

So, I think ""blast"" is a good choice because it has common letters: B, L, S, T.

But we already know A is in the word and in position 3, so we are using that to our advantage.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have A in the third position? But that would be inefficient because we know A is in position 3. So we should keep it there to get information about the other positions.

Therefore, I choose ""blast"".

But let me confirm: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

""blast"" is a valid English word.

So, our next guess: ""blast"".

We'll get feedback on B, L, S, T.

If we get a ✓ on any of these, we know that letter is in the correct position.

If we get a -, then that letter is in the word but wrong position.

If x, then not in the word.

So, let's go with ""blast"".

But note: we are not forced to keep A in the third position? Actually, we can, and it's beneficial because if the word has A in position 3, we get confirmation, but we already know that. So we can use that to test other positions.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has A in a different position to see if there is another A? But we don't have information about that. However, if we put A in a different position, and if there is another A, we might get a '-' or '✓' for that position? But we don't know.

But since we have limited guesses, it's better to keep A in position 3 and test the other positions with new letters.

So, I'll go with ""blast"".

But wait, what about ""salty""? It has A in position 2, so we cannot use it because we need A in position 3.

Similarly, ""tango"" has A in position 2.

So, ""blast"" is good.

Another word: ""plaid"" -> P-L-A-I-D -> avoids C, R, N, E. And it's common.

""plaid"": P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), D(5). This uses P, L, I, D.

We haven't tried P, L, I, D.

But ""blast"" has S and T, which are very common.

I think ""blast"" is fine.

So, our next guess: ""blast"".

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

""staid"" has S, T, I, D.

""staid"" is more common than ""blast""? Actually, both are common.

But ""blast"" has L, which is very common, and S and T.

We can also consider ""shalt"", but it's less common.

Another: ""spalt"" is not common.

I think ""blast"" is a good choice.

So, I'll go with ""blast"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, N, and E are not in the word (marked with ""x"").
- A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter, marked with ""✓"").

This means:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ A _ _`.
- The word does not contain C, R, N, or E.
- We should avoid these letters in the next guess and focus on testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, D, B, P) to maximize information about the other positions.

For the next guess:
- We must keep A in the 3rd position to leverage the known correct letter.
- We should choose a word that uses new, common letters to test positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.
- ""blast"" fits the pattern (`B L A S T`), avoids forbidden letters, and tests common consonants (B, L, S, T).

But we don\'t know if Q, U, F are in the word. However, we are avoiding R, C, N, E, but Q and U are new.\n\nBut ""quaff"" is a word? Yes, meaning to drink heartily.\n\nBut we have two F\'s? That might be okay.\n\nBut let\'s see: we are going to guess ""quaff"", which has Q, U, A (in position 3), F, F.\n\nWe are testing Q, U, F. But F is repeated, so we are testing F twice? That might not be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, ""salty"": S-A-L-T-Y -> but A is in position 2, not 3.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A.\n\nTry ""tameless"" -> 6 letters.\n\n""pawky"" -> P-A-W-K-Y -> A in position 2.\n\nI think I need to look for words that have A as the third letter.\n\nSome words: \n- ""drama"" is not because of R and also pattern mismatch.\n\nActually, ""drama"" has A in position 2.\n\nAnother: ""kayak"" -> K-A-Y-A-K -> A in position 2 and 4? And third is Y. Not A.\n\n""mokar"" -> not a common word, and R not allowed.\n\n""vodka"" -> V-O-D-K-A -> O in position 2, D in position 3? No, V(1), O(2), D(3), K(4), A(5) -> so the third letter is D, not A.\n\nI\'m stuck. Let me try a different approach: we know the word has A in the third position, and doesn\'t have C, R, N, E.\n\nSo, the word is: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4][letter5]\n\nWe have to choose a word that fits this pattern and uses letters that are not C, R, N, E.\n\nWe can try ""blast"" as I thought earlier: B-L-A-S-T -> positions: 1:B, 2:L, 3:A, 4:S, 5:T. This uses B, L, S, T, and we know A is in the word (and in position 3).\n\nBut we don\'t know if B, L, S, T are in the word. So it\'s a good candidate.\n\nAnother word: ""plant"" -> but N is not allowed.\n\n""slant"" -> S-L-A-N-T -> N is not allowed.\n\n""blast"" is acceptable because it doesn\'t contain C, R, N, E.\n\nAnother word: ""spalt"" -> S-P-A-L-T -> but the pattern: S(1), P(2), A(3), L(4), T(5). This avoids C, R, N, E. And it\'s a valid word (meaning to fry quickly in a little hot fat room).\n\nBut ""spalt"" is not very common. ""Blast"" is more common.\n\n""blast"" is a common word.\n\nAnother: ""staid"" -> S-T-A-I-D -> but the pattern: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), D(5). This avoids C, R, N, E. And it\'s common.\n\n""staid"" and ""blast"" are both options.\n\nBut ""blast"" has the advantage of having more common letters? Or ""staid"" has S, T, A, I, D.\n\nWe haven\'t tried S, T, L, I, D, B, etc.\n\nI think ""staid"" is a good choice because it has S, T, I, D which are common.\n\nBut note: we are going to get feedback on each position.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""pasta"" but it doesn\'t have A in the third position.\n\nAnother word: ""manta"" -> M-A-N-T-A -> N not allowed.\n\n""pate"" -> too short.\n\n""latke"" -> L-A-T-K-E -> E not allowed.\n\n""baton"" -> B-A-T-O-N -> N not allowed.\n\n""fatal"" -> F-A-T-A-L -> A in position 2 and 4? And third is T. Not A.\n\n""salad"" -> S-A-L-A-D -> A in position 2 and 4.\n\nI think ""staid"" is a good choice: S-T-A-I-D.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: S (1), T (2), A (3), I (4), D (5). And it doesn\'t contain C, R, N, E.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""staid"".\n\nAnother common word: ""shalt"" -> S-H-A-L-T -> H and L are new. But ""shalt"" is an archaic word, might not be in the word list.\n\n""blast"" is more common.\n\nBut ""staid"" is common.\n\nWe can also consider ""skate"": S-K-A-T-E -> but E is not allowed.\n\n""slate"" -> S-L-A-T-E -> E not allowed.\n\n""plate"" -> P-L-A-T-E -> E not allowed.\n\nSo, ""staid"" seems good.\n\nBut what about ""daisy""? D-A-I-S-Y -> A in position 2.\n\nWe need the third letter to be A.\n\nAnother word: ""basis"" -> B-A-S-I-S -> A in position 2.\n\n""asis"" -> A-S-S-I-S -> A in position 1.\n\nI think ""staid"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let\'s try to get more common letters. ""Staid"" uses S, T, A, I, D.\n\nWe can also consider ""tamed"": T-A-M-E-D -> E not allowed.\n\n""amed"" -> too short.\n\n""lapel"" -> L-A-P-E-L -> E not allowed.\n\n""papal"" -> P-A-P-A-L -> A in position 2 and 4.\n\nI think ""staid"" is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, we have to avoid E, so ""staid"" is valid.\n\nAnother word: ""sulfa"" -> S-U-L-F-A -> but the pattern: S(1), U(2), L(3), F(4), A(5) -> so the third letter is L, not A.\n\nNot matching.\n\n""tappa"" -> T-A-P-P-A -> A in position 2 and 5, and third is P.\n\nNot A.\n\nSo, I think ""staid"" is a good guess.\n\nBut let me check if there are other words.\n\n""quake"" -> Q-U-A-K-E -> E not allowed.\n\n""quake"" -> Q-U-A-K-E -> E not allowed.\n\n""raze"" -> R and E not allowed.\n\n""vague"" -> V-A-G-U-E -> E not allowed.\n\nSo, ""staid"" seems like a good option.\n\nWe can also consider ""daisy"" but A is not in position 3.\n\nAnother: ""hasps"" -> H-A-S-P-S -> A in position 2.\n\nI think we should go with ""staid"".\n\nBut note: we are going to get feedback on S, T, I, D in positions 1,2,4,5, and we know A is correct in position 3.\n\nSo, let\'s guess ""staid"".\n\nBut wait, what about ""blast""? It has B, L, S, T. We haven\'t tried these.\n\n""blast"" is more common than ""staid""? Actually, ""blast"" is very common.\n\nBut ""staid"" is also common.\n\nAnother word: ""swamp"" -> S-W-A-M-P -> avoids C, R, N, E. And it\'s a common word.\n\n""swamp"": S(1), W(2), A(3), M(4), P(5). This uses S, W, M, P.\n\nWe haven\'t tried S, W, M, P.\n\nBut ""swamp"" has W and M, which are less common than S and T? But we don\'t know.\n\n""staid"" has S, T, I, D.\n\nI think both are reasonable.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.\n\n""blast"" uses B, L, S, T.\n""staid"" uses S, T, I, D.\n\nL is more common than I and D? Actually, L is very common.\n\nBut we can also consider ""shalt"" but it\'s less common.\n\nAnother word: ""smack"" -> S-M-A-C-K -> C is not allowed.\n\n""spack"" -> not a word.\n\n""stack"" -> S-T-A-C-K -> C not allowed.\n\nSo, I think ""blast"" is a good choice because it has common letters: B, L, S, T.\n\nBut we already know A is in the word and in position 3, so we are using that to our advantage.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t have A in the third position? But that would be inefficient because we know A is in position 3. So we should keep it there to get information about the other positions.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""blast"".\n\nBut let me confirm: the word must be 5 letters and valid.\n\n""blast"" is a valid English word.\n\nSo, our next guess: ""blast"".\n\nWe\'ll get feedback on B, L, S, T.\n\nIf we get a ✓ on any of these, we know that letter is in the correct position.\n\nIf we get a -, then that letter is in the word but wrong position.\n\nIf x, then not in the word.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""blast"".\n\nBut note: we are not forced to keep A in the third position? Actually, we can, and it\'s beneficial because if the word has A in position 3, we get confirmation, but we already know that. So we can use that to test other positions.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that has A in a different position to see if there is another A? But we don\'t have information about that. However, if we put A in a different position, and if there is another A, we might get a \'-\' or \'✓\' for that position? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut since we have limited guesses, it\'s better to keep A in position 3 and test the other positions with new letters.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""blast"".\n\nBut wait, what about ""salty""? It has A in position 2, so we cannot use it because we need A in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""tango"" has A in position 2.\n\nSo, ""blast"" is good.\n\nAnother word: ""plaid"" -> P-L-A-I-D -> avoids C, R, N, E. And it\'s common.\n\n""plaid"": P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), D(5). This uses P, L, I, D.\n\nWe haven\'t tried P, L, I, D.\n\nBut ""blast"" has S and T, which are very common.\n\nI think ""blast"" is fine.\n\nSo, our next guess: ""blast"".\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.\n\n""staid"" has S, T, I, D.\n\n""staid"" is more common than ""blast""? Actually, both are common.\n\nBut ""blast"" has L, which is very common, and S and T.\n\nWe can also consider ""shalt"", but it\'s less common.\n\nAnother: ""spalt"" is not common.\n\nI think ""blast"" is a good choice.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""blast"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, N, and E are not in the word (marked with ""x"").\n- A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter, marked with ""✓"").\n\nThis means:\n- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ A _ _`.\n- The word does not contain C, R, N, or E.\n- We should avoid these letters in the next guess and focus on testing new common letters (e.g., S, T, L, I, D, B, P) to maximize information about the other positions.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- We must keep A in the 3rd position to leverage the known correct letter.\n- We should choose a word that uses new, common letters to test positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n- ""blast"" fits the pattern (`B L A S T`), avoids forbidden letters, and tests common consonants (B, L, S, T).\n\n<guess>blast</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: blast -> FEEDBACK: B(-) L(x) A(✓) S(-) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is A)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""blast""
- B: - (in the word but wrong position)
- L: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, third letter)
- S: - (in the word but wrong position)
- T: x (not in the word)

So, from this, we know:

1. The word has the pattern: _ _ A _ _
2. The word contains the letters B and S, but not in the positions we guessed (B was in position 1, S in position 4).
3. The word does not contain: C, R, N, E, L, T.

Also, from the first guess, we know that A is in the third position, and from the second guess, we confirm that A is still in the third position.

Now, the letters B and S are in the word, but not in position 1 and not in position 4 (from the second guess). So B cannot be in position 1, and S cannot be in position 4.

We need to make a third guess.

The word pattern: [1][2]A[4][5]

We know the word has B and S, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively? Actually, B is in the word but not in position 1, and S is in the word but not in position 4. Also, since the word has 5 letters, B and S must be in positions 2, 4, or 5? But position 4 is the only position left? Actually, positions 2, 4, and 5 are open.

But we know B is not in position 1, and S is not in position 4.

Also, we have to avoid the letters: C, R, N, E, L, T.

So, available letters: We can use any letter except C, R, N, E, L, T.

But we know the word has B and S, and A (which is fixed at position 3).

So, the word must contain at least B, S, and A.

Now, for the third guess, we should try to place B and S in positions that are allowed and test new letters for the remaining positions.

We have positions 1, 2, 4, 5 to fill.

But we know B cannot be in position 1, and S cannot be in position 4.

So for position 1: cannot be B, and we don't know what it is. Similarly, position 4: cannot be S, and position 5: cannot be S? Actually, S can be in position 5? The feedback for S was that it is in the word but not in position 4. So it can be in position 2, 5? But position 2 is open, and position 5 is open.

But we also have to consider that B is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5? But position 4 is the fourth position, and position 5 is the fifth.

We can try to form a word that has:
- Position 1: not B, and not any of the forbidden letters. We can try a new common letter like P, D, M, etc.
- Position 2: could be B? But we don't know. Or it could be another letter.
- Position 4: not S, and not forbidden letters.
- Position 5: not S, and not forbidden.

But we know the word must have B and S, so one of the positions (2 or 5) must be S? Or S could be in position 2? But we don't know.

We can try to use a word that has S in position 2 and B in position 4? Or S in position 5 and B in position 2? Etc.

But we also have to test new letters for the other positions.

We have to avoid: C, R, N, E, L, T.

Available common letters: S, S (we know it's present), B (present), A (fixed), and then P, D, M, H, G, Y, etc.

But we don't know the exact positions of B and S.

We can try to put S in position 2 and B in position 4? But we don't know if that's correct, but it would test the positions.

Alternatively, we can try to put S in position 5 and B in position 2? But position 2 is open.

Let me list possible words that fit the pattern and use only available letters.

Pattern: [1][2]A[4][5]

With [1][2][4][5] being letters not in {C, R, N, E, L, T}, and must include B and S.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

Some ideas:

- If we put B in position 2, then we have: [1] B A [4] [5]
But what can [1] be? It must be a letter not forbidden, and we haven't tried many consonants.

For example: ""aback"" -> but A is in position 1? And we have A in position 3, but if there is another A? But we don't know. However, ""aback"" has A in position 1 and 3? Actually: A(1), B(2), A(3), C(4), K(5) -> but C is forbidden (from first guess). So invalid.

""obasys"" -> too long.

""ubasys"" -> not a word.

""cabby"" -> C is forbidden.

""daisy"" -> D-A-I-S-Y -> but A is in position 2, not 3.

We need the third letter to be A.

Another word: ""basal"" -> B-A-S-A-L -> but L is forbidden (from second guess, L is not in the word). So invalid.

""basal"" has L, which is not allowed.

""pasta"" -> P-A-S-T-A -> but T is forbidden (from second guess, T is not in the word) and also the pattern: P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5) -> but we need the third letter to be A, but here S is in position 3? And T is forbidden. So invalid.

""mashy"" -> M-A-S-H-Y -> A in position 2.

I think I'm having trouble finding words that fit.

Let me think of words that have A in the third position and contain B and S.

For example: 
- ""cabob"" -> C forbidden.
- ""dabba"" -> not a word.
- ""gamba"" -> G-A-M-B-A -> A in position 2 and 5? And third is M. Not A.

""jamba"" -> same.

""kappa"" -> K-A-P-P-A -> A in position 2 and 5.

Not matching.

""delta"" -> D-E-L-T-A -> E and L and T forbidden.

""fella"" -> F-E-L-L-A -> E and L forbidden.

""villa"" -> V-I-L-L-A -> L forbidden.

""extra"" -> E-X-T-R-A -> E, T, R forbidden.

""ultra"" -> U-L-T-R-A -> L, T, R forbidden.

""ompas"" -> O-M-P-A-S -> but the pattern: O(1), M(2), P(3), A(4), S(5) -> so the third letter is P, not A.

We need the third letter to be A.

Another idea: ""sabha"" -> S-A-B-H-A -> A in position 2 and 5? And third is B? Not A.

""sauna"" -> S-A-U-N-A -> N forbidden.

""seuba"" -> not a word.

""shiba"" -> not common.

""shiba"" is not a word.

""skiba"" -> not a word.

""smoha"" -> not.

""spaha"" -> not.

""swiba"" -> not.

""swiga"" -> S-W-I-G-A -> but the pattern: S(1), W(2), I(3), G(4), A(5) -> so the third letter is I, not A.

We need the third letter to be A.

Let me try ""quabs"" -> Q-U-A-B-S -> but the pattern: Q(1), U(2), A(3), B(4), S(5). This fits the pattern? Actually: position 1: Q, 2: U, 3: A, 4: B, 5: S. So yes, the third letter is A.

And it contains B and S, which are present.

But we have to check the forbidden letters: Q, U, A, B, S. A is allowed, B is allowed (we know B is in the word), S is allowed (we know S is in the word). And Q and U are new, not forbidden.

But is ""quabs"" a word? Yes, meaning to hold something.

But we have to avoid E, which we are.

But we know from the second guess that L and T are not in the word, and ""quabs"" doesn't have L or T.

So, ""quabs"" is a candidate.

But we have to consider that in the first guess, we had A in position 3 correct, and in the second guess, we had A again in position 3 correct.

Now, in ""quabs"", we have A in position 3, which is good.

But we are going to test Q and U as new letters.

But we also have B in position 4 and S in position 5.

From the feedback of the second guess, we know that S is not in position 4 (which is good because in ""quabs"" S is in position 5, so that's fine) and B is not in position 1 (which is good, because in ""quabs"" B is in position 4).

But we don't know if B and S are in the positions we are about to test.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has B and S in different positions to test.

But we have to use the available letters.

Another word: ""sabat"" -> not a word.

""sebats"" -> not common.

""sebas"" -> S-E-B-A-S -> E forbidden.

""shabu"" -> not a word.

""shadY"" -> not a word.

""shafu"" -> not.

""shigA"" -> not.

""shish"" -> S-H-I-S-H -> third letter is I, not A.

We need the third letter to be A.

""quabs"" seems okay.

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

Another word: ""dabba"" -> not a word.

""gamba"" -> not.

""kappa"" -> not.

""lappa"" -> L is forbidden.

""mappa"" -> M-A-P-P-A -> A in position 2.

Not.

""pappa"" -> P-A-P-P-A -> A in position 2.

Not.

""tappa"" -> T is forbidden.

So, ""quabs"" is a possibility.

But we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have information.

Another word: ""jacks"" -> J-A-C-K-S -> C forbidden.

""facks"" -> F-A-C-K-S -> C forbidden.

""backs"" -> B-A-C-K-S -> C forbidden.

""macks"" -> M-A-C-K-S -> C forbidden.

""stacks"" -> S-T-A-C-K-S -> T and C forbidden.

""blocks"" -> B-L-O-C-K-S -> L and C forbidden.

""focus"" -> F-O-C-U-S -> C forbidden.

""locum"" -> L and U? But L is forbidden.

""vocal"" -> V-O-C-A-L -> C and L forbidden.

""vodka"" -> V-O-D-K-A -> O, D, K, A. But the pattern: V(1), O(2), D(3), K(4), A(5) -> so the third letter is D, not A.

Not.

""aback"" -> A-B-A-C-K -> C forbidden.

I'm struggling. Let me try ""quabs"".

But we have to make sure that the word is valid.

Another word: ""sabat"" is not English.

""sebats"" is not common.

""sebas"" -> S-E-B-A-S -> E forbidden.

""shad"" is 4 letters.

""shadY"" not a word.

""shig"" is 4.

""shil"" -> S-H-I-L -> L forbidden and also not A in third.

We need the third letter to be A.

""quabs"" is one of the few options.

Another: ""jabs"" is 4 letters.

""kabs"" -> K-A-B-S -> 4 letters.

""mabs"" -> M-A-B-S -> 4.

""pabs"" -> P-A-B-S -> 4.

""tabs"" -> T-A-B-S -> 4, and T is forbidden.

""vabs"" -> V-A-B-S -> 4.

But we need 5 letters.

""quabs"" is 5: Q-U-A-B-S.

So, I think ""quabs"" is a valid guess.

But we are testing Q and U, which are less common. Maybe there is a better word.

Another idea: ""dowly"" -> D-O-W-L-Y -> L forbidden.

""bowla"" -> B-O-W-L-A -> L forbidden and A in position 5? Not 3.

""bowla"" is B-O-W-L-A -> positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:W, 4:L, 5:A -> so third is W, not A.

Not.

""crwth"" -> C and R forbidden.

I think ""quabs"" is acceptable.

But let me check if there is a word with B and S and A in the third position, without the forbidden letters.

""quabs"" is one.

""jabs"" is 4, not 5.

""cabob"" -> C forbidden.

""adobe"" -> A-D-O-B-E -> E forbidden and also A is in position 1.

""anode"" -> N and E forbidden.

""apace"" -> A-P-A-C-E -> C and E forbidden.

""arose"" -> A-R-O-S-E -> R and E forbidden.

""ashen"" -> A-S-H-E-N -> E and N forbidden.

""atoll"" -> A-T-O-L-L -> T and L forbidden.

""avoid"" -> A-V-O-I-D -> but the pattern: A(1), V(2), O(3), I(4), D(5) -> third is O, not A.

We need the third letter to be A.

""quabs"" is a word.

Another word: ""sabat"" is not English.

""sebats"" is not common.

""sebas"" -> S-E-B-A-S -> E forbidden.

""shad"" is 4.

""shadY"" not a word.

""shig"" is 4.

""shil"" -> S-H-I-L -> L forbidden.

""shola"" -> S-H-O-L-A -> L forbidden and A in position 5.

Not.

""shorL"" -> not.

I think ""quabs"" is the only common word I can think of.

But there is also ""swabs"" -> S-W-A-B-S -> but that's 5 letters: S(1), W(2), A(3), B(4), S(5). This has two S's? But we don't know if the word has two S's.

But ""swabs"" is a word.

And it fits: S(1), W(2), A(3), B(4), S(5). But the pattern: position 1: S, 2: W, 3: A, 4: B, 5: S. So we have S in position 1 and 5.

But we know from the second guess that S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice.

In ""blast"", we had S in position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So S could be in position 1,2,5? But in this guess, we are putting S in position 1 and 5.

But we don't know if the word has two S's.

But ""swabs"" is a valid word.

And it avoids the forbidden letters: no C, R, N, E, L, T.

So, ""swabs"" is another candidate.

But ""quabs"" has Q and U, which are less common, and ""swabs"" has W and B, which are more common? But we already know B is in the word, and S is in the word.

In ""swabs"", we have S in position 1 and 5. If the word has only one S, then one of these might be x, but we know S is in the word, so at least one S must be present. If there are two S's, then we might get feedback for both.

But we are trying to find the exact positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have S in position 4 and B in position 1, but we are free to choose.

But we need to test new letters.

We have positions 1,2,4,5 to test, but we know the word has B and S, so we are testing for their positions.

In ""quabs"", we test Q and U for positions 1 and 2, and B and S for 4 and 5.

In ""swabs"", we test S for 1 and 5, and B for 4.

But we already know S is in the word, so if we put S in position 1 and it's correct, we get a ✓, or if not, we get a - or x? But if we get x for S in position 1, then we know S must be in position 5? But the word might have only one S.

Similarly, for B, we know it's in the word, so if we put B in position 4 and it's correct, we get ✓, or if not, we get - or x? But if we get x for B, then we know B must be in position 2? But position 2 is the only other open position.

But we have two open positions: 1 and 2, and 4 and 5, but we know the word has B and S, so one of them must occupy one of these positions.

But we don't know which.

To maximize information, we might want to test new letters in the open positions.

But we have to include B and S.

So, let's consider:

Option 1: ""quabs"" -> tests Q (position 1), U (position 2), B (position 4), S (position 5). But Q and U are less common, so if we get feedback that Q or U is present, it might be rare. But we have to test.

Option 2: ""swabs"" -> tests S (position 1), W (new, position 2), B (position 4), S (position 5). So we are testing S in position 1 and 5, and B in position 4.

But ""swabs"" has two S's, which might be inefficient if the word has only one S.

Option 3: ""sabs"" is 4 letters.

""abs"" is 4.

I think ""swabs"" is acceptable, but let's see if there is a word with new letters.

Another word: ""dabba"" not a word.

""gamba"" not.

""kappa"" not.

""lappa"" not.

""mappa"" not.

""pappa"" not.

""tappa"" not.

""vappa"" not.

""wappa"" not.

""yappa"" not.

""zappa"" not.

So, ""quabs"" and ""swabs"" are the only common words I can think of.

But ""quabs"" has Q and U, which are less common. ""swabs"" has W, which is more common.

But ""swabs"" has S in position 1 and 5, which might be redundant if the word has only one S.

But we don't know.

Perhaps ""pabs"" is 4, not 5.

""abs"" is 4.

Another word: ""sabat"" not English.

""sebats"" not common.

""sebas"" -> S-E-B-A-S -> E forbidden.

""shad"" is 4.

I think we should go with ""swabs"" because it uses W, which is common, and we test S in two positions.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If the word has only one S, then one of the S's might be x, and the other might be - or ✓? But we don't know.

But we are trying to get information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't repeat S, but we don't know such a word.

Another idea: ""dabba"" not English.

""gamba"" not.

""kappa"" not.

I think we have to choose between ""quabs"" and ""swabs"".

But let me check if there is a word with A in the third position, B in position 2, and S in position 5? But we need the first letter to be something.

For example: ""umbra"" -> U-M-B-R-A -> R forbidden.

""umbra"" has R.

""delta"" -> E and L forbidden.

""vodka"" -> V-O-D-K-A -> O, D, K, A. Pattern: V(1), O(2), D(3), K(4), A(5) -> third is D, not A.

Not.

""vodka"" is not.

""vixen"" -> V-I-X-E-N -> E and N forbidden.

Not.

So, I think ""swabs"" is a valid choice.

But let's see if there is a word with a new letter in position 1 and position 2.

For example, ""pawky"" -> P-A-W-K-Y -> A in position 2.

Not.

""bawky"" -> B-A-W-K-Y -> A in position 2.

Not.

""wacky"" -> W-A-C-K-Y -> C forbidden.

Not.

""jacks"" -> C forbidden.

I think we have to go with ""swabs"" or ""quabs"".

But ""quabs"" has Q and U, which are rare. ""swabs"" has W, which is more common.

But ""swabs"" has S in position 1 and 5, which might be redundant.

But it's a valid word.

Another word: ""sabat"" is not English.

""sebats"" is not common.

""sebas"" has E.

""shad"" is 4.

""shadY"" not a word.

""shil"" has L.

I found: ""sabat"" is not, but ""sabir"" is not English.

""salet"" -> S-A-L-E-T -> L, E, T forbidden.

Not.

""salad"" -> S-A-L-A-D -> L forbidden and A in position 2.

Not.

""salts"" -> S-A-L-T-S -> L and T forbidden.

Not.

""smalt"" -> S-M-A-L-T -> L and T forbidden.

Not.

""spalt"" -> S-P-A-L-T -> L and T forbidden.

Not.

""staid"" -> S-T-A-I-D -> T forbidden.

Not.

""swAMI"" -> not 5 letters? ""swami"" is 5: S-W-A-M-I -> but the pattern: S(1), W(2), A(3), M(4), I(5). This avoids forbidden letters? S, W, A, M, I. A is allowed, S is allowed, W is new, M is new, I is new.

And ""swami"" is a word.

But we have to check if it fits: the word has S, A, and B? No, ""swami"" does not have B. But we know the word has B, so ""swami"" cannot be the word because it doesn't have B.

We must include B.

So, ""swami"" is invalid because it lacks B.

Similarly, ""quabs"" has B and S.

""quabs"": Q-U-A-B-S -> includes B and S.

""swabs"": S-W-A-B-S -> includes B and S.

Another word: ""jabs"" is 4, not 5.

""abs"" is 4.

""babs"" is 4.

""dabs"" is 4.

""habs"" is 4.

""labs"" is 4 and L forbidden.

""mabs"" is 4.

""pabs"" is 4.

""tabs"" is 4 and T forbidden.

So, 5-letter words with A in the third position, containing B and S, and without C, R, N, E, L, T.

""quabs"" and ""swabs"" are the only common ones I can think of.

""quabs"" has U, which is a vowel, and Q is a consonant.

""swabs"" has W, which is a consonant, and S repeated.

But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

Another possibility: ""sabat"" is not, but ""sabir"" is not English.

""salet"" is not.

""salad"" is not.

""salts"" is not.

""smalt"" is not.

""spalt"" is not.

""staid"" is not because T is forbidden.

""swAMI"" is not because it doesn't have B.

So, I think we have to choose between ""quabs"" and ""swabs"".

But let me try ""swabs"": S-W-A-B-S.

But we are putting S in position 1 and 5. If the word has only one S, then one of them might be x, and the other might be - or ✓? But we don't know.

But we are testing the positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have S in position 4 and B in position 1, but we don't have many options.

Another word: ""dabba"" not English.

""gamba"" not.

""kappa"" not.

""lappa"" not.

""mappa"" not.

""pappa"" not.

""tappa"" not.

""vappa"" not.

""wappa"" not.

""yappa"" not.

""zappa"" not.

So, I think ""swabs"" is a valid guess.

But we can also consider ""quabs"", but Q and U are rare.

Perhaps ""pabs"" is 4, but we can't make a 5-letter word.

Another word: ""sabat"" is not, but ""sabir"" is not English.

""salet"" is not.

""salad"" not.

""salts"" not.

""smalt"" not.

""spalt"" not.

""staid"" not.

""swAMI"" not.

So, I think we have to go with ""swabs"".

But let me confirm: ""swabs"" is a valid English word.

So, third guess: ""swabs"".

But note: we are testing S in position 1 and 5, and B in position 4.

If we get:
- S in position 1: if it's correct, we get ✓, if not, we get x (but if x, then S must be in position 5, since we know S is in the word and not in 4, and position 1 is tested).

Similarly for B: we are putting B in position 4. If it's correct, we get ✓, if not, we get x, meaning B must be in position 2? But position 2 is the only other open position.

But if B is not in position 4, then it must be in position 2? But we don't have B in position 2 in this guess.

In this guess, we are not testing position 2 for B.

But we know B is in the word, so if we don't get a ✓ for B in position 4, then we know B must be in position 2? But we are not testing position 2 for B in this guess.

In ""swabs"", we are testing:
- Position 1: S (if S is in the word, we get feedback: if S is in position 1, ✓; if not, but S is in the word, so if not in 1, then it must be in 5? But we are also testing position 5 for S.

Similarly for B: position 4.

But we know B is in the word, so if we get x for B in position 4, then B must be in position 2? But we don't have a guess with B in position 2.

We have to include B.

Another word: ""dabba"" not English.

""gamba"" not.

""kappa"" not.

I think we have to accept that ""quabs"" or ""swabs"" are the best we can do.

But let me try ""quabs"": Q-U-A-B-S.

But Q is uncommon, and U is a vowel, but we don't know if vowels are allowed elsewhere? We know A is in the word, but we don't know about other vowels.

But the word must have vowels? Probably.

But we know E is not in the word, so other vowels: A is already used, but we can have I, O, U.

In ""quabs"", we have U, which is a vowel.

But we have to avoid E, which we are.

But I think ""swabs"" is more common? Or ""quabs"".

But to be safe, let's choose ""swabs"".

But we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but we don't have evidence.

Another word: ""sabat"" is not English.

""sebats"" is not common.

""sebas"" has E.

I think ""swabs"" is a reasonable choice.

But let me see if there is a word with B in position 2 and S in position 5? For example, ""umbra"" is not, because no B.

""umbra"" has R.

""delta"" has E and L.

Not.

""vodka"" has O, D, K, A, but no B.

Not.

So, I think we have to go with ""swabs"".

But let's try ""swabs"".

So, third guess: ""swabs"".

But note: we are not forced to include B in this guess? We know B is in the word, but we are not including it? That would be inefficient because we need to find the position of B.

We know B is in the word, so we should include it to get information about its position.

Similarly for S.

So, we must include both B and S in the guess.

Therefore, ""swabs"" is a good choice because it includes B and S, and A in position 3.

So, I'll go with ""swabs"".

But let me double-check the feedback.

In the second guess, we had ""blast"": B(-) L(x) A(✓) S(-) T(x)

So, B is in the word, not in position 1. S is in the word, not in position 4.

So for ""swabs"": 
- Position 1: S -> if the word has S in position 1, we get ✓; if not, we get x. But if we get x for S in position 1, then S must be in position 5? Because we know S is in the word and not in 4, so it must be in 1 or 5. If we get x for S in position 1, then S must be in position 5.

Similarly, for B: position 4. If we get x for B, then B must be in position 2? Because we know B is in the word and not in 1, and positions 4 and 5 are open, but we are putting B in 4, and if it's not there, then it must be in 2? But we don't have a guess with B in position 2.

But we will have to infer.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has B in position 2 and S in position 5? But we don't know such a word.

For example, ""umbra"" is not.

""umbra"" has R.

Not.

""delta"" not.

I think it's impossible to test position 2 for B without using forbidden letters.

So, we have to choose between ""quabs"" and ""swabs"".

I think ""swabs"" is more common.

But let's see the frequency.

Another word: ""sabat"" is not, but ""sabir"" is not English.

""salet"" is not.

""salad"" not.

""salts"" not.

""smalt"" not.

""spalt"" not.

""staid"" not.

So, I think ""swabs"" is a valid guess.

We'll guess ""swabs"".

But note: we are using S in position 1 and 5. If the word has only one S, then one of them might be x, and the other might be ✓ or -.

But we can get information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has B in position 2 and S in position 4? But S cannot be in position 4? The feedback said S is not in position 4, so we cannot put S in position 4.

In ""swabs"", we are putting S in position 1 and 5, not 4.

Position 4 is B.

So, I think it's fine.

So, third guess: ""swabs"".

But let me write it: S-W-A-B-S.

So, <guess>swabs</guess>

But we must output in the format.

But before that, we have to think step by step.

Step-by-step:

1. We know the word has A in position 3 and contains B and S, which are not in position 1 (for B, not position 1; for S, not position 4) and the word does not contain C, R, N, E, L, T.

2. So the pattern is _ _ A _ _.

3. We need to include B and S in the guess to test their positions.

4. We choose ""swabs"" because it has S in position 1 and 5, and B in position 4, and avoids forbidden letters, and it's a common word.

5. This guess will help us locate B and S.

6. If we get feedback that S in position 1 is x, then S must be in position 5, and similarly for B.

But we are also testing W and the second S.

So, I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, we guess ""swabs"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)  
  - A is in the word and correctly placed in position 3.  
  - C, R, N, E are not in the word.  
- **Guess 2: blast** → Feedback: B(-), L(x), A(✓), S(-), T(x)  
  - A is confirmed in position 3.  
  - B and S are in the word but not in positions 1 or 4, respectively.  
  - L and T are not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word pattern: `_ _ A _ _` (A is fixed in position 3).  
- Confirmed letters: **A** (position 3), **B** (somewhere, not position 1), **S** (somewhere, not position 4).  
- Forbidden letters: C, R, N, E, L, T.  
- Remaining positions to solve: 1, 2, 4, 5.  
- B must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (since not 1).  
- S must be in position 2, 5 (since not 4).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- We must include **B** and **S** to test their positions, as they are confirmed present.  
- Avoid forbidden letters (C, R, N, E, L, T).  
- Test new common letters for the remaining open positions (e.g., D, G, H, I, M, P, Y) to maximize information.  
- The word must fit `_ _ A _ _`, with B and S placed appropriately (B not in 1, S not in 4).  

### Why ""swabs""?
- **S** in position 1 and 5: Tests if S is in position 1 or 5 (or both).  
- **W** in position 2: Tests a new common consonant.  
- **A** in position 3: Confirmed correct (so ✓).  
- **B** in position 4: Tests if B is in position 4 (or if it's elsewhere).  
- **S** in position 5: Tests if S is in position 5 (or if it's duplicated).  
- Avoids forbidden letters (no C, R, N, E, L, T).  

""swabs"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits the constraints and tests key positions for B and S. If S is in position 1, we get ✓; if not, we learn it must be in position 5. Similarly, B in position 4: if ✓, we lock it; if -, we know B must be in position 2 (since it's the only other option).  

<guess>swabs</guess>",swabs,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, so the third letter is A)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: ""blast""
- B: - (in the word but wrong position)
- L: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct position, third letter)
- S: - (in the word but wrong position)
- T: x (not in the word)

So, from this, we know:

1. The word has the pattern: _ _ A _ _
2. The word contains the letters B and S, but not in the positions we guessed (B was in position 1, S in position 4).
3. The word does not contain: C, R, N, E, L, T.

Also, from the first guess, we know that A is in the third position, and from the second guess, we confirm that A is still in the third position.

Now, the letters B and S are in the word, but not in position 1 and not in position 4 (from the second guess). So B cannot be in position 1, and S cannot be in position 4.

We need to make a third guess.

The word pattern: [1][2]A[4][5]

We know the word has B and S, but not in positions 1 and 4 respectively? Actually, B is in the word but not in position 1, and S is in the word but not in position 4. Also, since the word has 5 letters, B and S must be in positions 2, 4, or 5? But position 4 is the only position left? Actually, positions 2, 4, and 5 are open.

But we know B is not in position 1, and S is not in position 4.

Also, we have to avoid the letters: C, R, N, E, L, T.

So, available letters: We can use any letter except C, R, N, E, L, T.

But we know the word has B and S, and A (which is fixed at position 3).

So, the word must contain at least B, S, and A.

Now, for the third guess, we should try to place B and S in positions that are allowed and test new letters for the remaining positions.

We have positions 1, 2, 4, 5 to fill.

But we know B cannot be in position 1, and S cannot be in position 4.

So for position 1: cannot be B, and we don't know what it is. Similarly, position 4: cannot be S, and position 5: cannot be S? Actually, S can be in position 5? The feedback for S was that it is in the word but not in position 4. So it can be in position 2, 5? But position 2 is open, and position 5 is open.

But we also have to consider that B is in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5? But position 4 is the fourth position, and position 5 is the fifth.

We can try to form a word that has:
- Position 1: not B, and not any of the forbidden letters. We can try a new common letter like P, D, M, etc.
- Position 2: could be B? But we don't know. Or it could be another letter.
- Position 4: not S, and not forbidden letters.
- Position 5: not S, and not forbidden.

But we know the word must have B and S, so one of the positions (2 or 5) must be S? Or S could be in position 2? But we don't know.

We can try to use a word that has S in position 2 and B in position 4? Or S in position 5 and B in position 2? Etc.

But we also have to test new letters for the other positions.

We have to avoid: C, R, N, E, L, T.

Available common letters: S, S (we know it's present), B (present), A (fixed), and then P, D, M, H, G, Y, etc.

But we don't know the exact positions of B and S.

We can try to put S in position 2 and B in position 4? But we don't know if that's correct, but it would test the positions.

Alternatively, we can try to put S in position 5 and B in position 2? But position 2 is open.

Let me list possible words that fit the pattern and use only available letters.

Pattern: [1][2]A[4][5]

With [1][2][4][5] being letters not in {C, R, N, E, L, T}, and must include B and S.

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

Some ideas:

- If we put B in position 2, then we have: [1] B A [4] [5]
But what can [1] be? It must be a letter not forbidden, and we haven't tried many consonants.

For example: ""aback"" -> but A is in position 1? And we have A in position 3, but if there is another A? But we don't know. However, ""aback"" has A in position 1 and 3? Actually: A(1), B(2), A(3), C(4), K(5) -> but C is forbidden (from first guess). So invalid.

""obasys"" -> too long.

""ubasys"" -> not a word.

""cabby"" -> C is forbidden.

""daisy"" -> D-A-I-S-Y -> but A is in position 2, not 3.

We need the third letter to be A.

Another word: ""basal"" -> B-A-S-A-L -> but L is forbidden (from second guess, L is not in the word). So invalid.

""basal"" has L, which is not allowed.

""pasta"" -> P-A-S-T-A -> but T is forbidden (from second guess, T is not in the word) and also the pattern: P(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), A(5) -> but we need the third letter to be A, but here S is in position 3? And T is forbidden. So invalid.

""mashy"" -> M-A-S-H-Y -> A in position 2.

I think I'm having trouble finding words that fit.

Let me think of words that have A in the third position and contain B and S.

For example: 
- ""cabob"" -> C forbidden.
- ""dabba"" -> not a word.
- ""gamba"" -> G-A-M-B-A -> A in position 2 and 5? And third is M. Not A.

""jamba"" -> same.

""kappa"" -> K-A-P-P-A -> A in position 2 and 5.

Not matching.

""delta"" -> D-E-L-T-A -> E and L and T forbidden.

""fella"" -> F-E-L-L-A -> E and L forbidden.

""villa"" -> V-I-L-L-A -> L forbidden.

""extra"" -> E-X-T-R-A -> E, T, R forbidden.

""ultra"" -> U-L-T-R-A -> L, T, R forbidden.

""ompas"" -> O-M-P-A-S -> but the pattern: O(1), M(2), P(3), A(4), S(5) -> so the third letter is P, not A.

We need the third letter to be A.

Another idea: ""sabha"" -> S-A-B-H-A -> A in position 2 and 5? And third is B? Not A.

""sauna"" -> S-A-U-N-A -> N forbidden.

""seuba"" -> not a word.

""shiba"" -> not common.

""shiba"" is not a word.

""skiba"" -> not a word.

""smoha"" -> not.

""spaha"" -> not.

""swiba"" -> not.

""swiga"" -> S-W-I-G-A -> but the pattern: S(1), W(2), I(3), G(4), A(5) -> so the third letter is I, not A.

We need the third letter to be A.

Let me try ""quabs"" -> Q-U-A-B-S -> but the pattern: Q(1), U(2), A(3), B(4), S(5). This fits the pattern? Actually: position 1: Q, 2: U, 3: A, 4: B, 5: S. So yes, the third letter is A.

And it contains B and S, which are present.

But we have to check the forbidden letters: Q, U, A, B, S. A is allowed, B is allowed (we know B is in the word), S is allowed (we know S is in the word). And Q and U are new, not forbidden.

But is ""quabs"" a word? Yes, meaning to hold something.

But we have to avoid E, which we are.

But we know from the second guess that L and T are not in the word, and ""quabs"" doesn't have L or T.

So, ""quabs"" is a candidate.

But we have to consider that in the first guess, we had A in position 3 correct, and in the second guess, we had A again in position 3 correct.

Now, in ""quabs"", we have A in position 3, which is good.

But we are going to test Q and U as new letters.

But we also have B in position 4 and S in position 5.

From the feedback of the second guess, we know that S is not in position 4 (which is good because in ""quabs"" S is in position 5, so that's fine) and B is not in position 1 (which is good, because in ""quabs"" B is in position 4).

But we don't know if B and S are in the positions we are about to test.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has B and S in different positions to test.

But we have to use the available letters.

Another word: ""sabat"" -> not a word.

""sebats"" -> not common.

""sebas"" -> S-E-B-A-S -> E forbidden.

""shabu"" -> not a word.

""shadY"" -> not a word.

""shafu"" -> not.

""shigA"" -> not.

""shish"" -> S-H-I-S-H -> third letter is I, not A.

We need the third letter to be A.

""quabs"" seems okay.

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

Another word: ""dabba"" -> not a word.

""gamba"" -> not.

""kappa"" -> not.

""lappa"" -> L is forbidden.

""mappa"" -> M-A-P-P-A -> A in position 2.

Not.

""pappa"" -> P-A-P-P-A -> A in position 2.

Not.

""tappa"" -> T is forbidden.

So, ""quabs"" is a possibility.

But we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have information.

Another word: ""jacks"" -> J-A-C-K-S -> C forbidden.

""facks"" -> F-A-C-K-S -> C forbidden.

""backs"" -> B-A-C-K-S -> C forbidden.

""macks"" -> M-A-C-K-S -> C forbidden.

""stacks"" -> S-T-A-C-K-S -> T and C forbidden.

""blocks"" -> B-L-O-C-K-S -> L and C forbidden.

""focus"" -> F-O-C-U-S -> C forbidden.

""locum"" -> L and U? But L is forbidden.

""vocal"" -> V-O-C-A-L -> C and L forbidden.

""vodka"" -> V-O-D-K-A -> O, D, K, A. But the pattern: V(1), O(2), D(3), K(4), A(5) -> so the third letter is D, not A.

Not.

""aback"" -> A-B-A-C-K -> C forbidden.

I'm struggling. Let me try ""quabs"".

But we have to make sure that the word is valid.

Another word: ""sabat"" is not English.

""sebats"" is not common.

""sebas"" -> S-E-B-A-S -> E forbidden.

""shad"" is 4 letters.

""shadY"" not a word.

""shig"" is 4.

""shil"" -> S-H-I-L -> L forbidden and also not A in third.

We need the third letter to be A.

""quabs"" is one of the few options.

Another: ""jabs"" is 4 letters.

""kabs"" -> K-A-B-S -> 4 letters.

""mabs"" -> M-A-B-S -> 4.

""pabs"" -> P-A-B-S -> 4.

""tabs"" -> T-A-B-S -> 4, and T is forbidden.

""vabs"" -> V-A-B-S -> 4.

But we need 5 letters.

""quabs"" is 5: Q-U-A-B-S.

So, I think ""quabs"" is a valid guess.

But we are testing Q and U, which are less common. Maybe there is a better word.

Another idea: ""dowly"" -> D-O-W-L-Y -> L forbidden.

""bowla"" -> B-O-W-L-A -> L forbidden and A in position 5? Not 3.

""bowla"" is B-O-W-L-A -> positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:W, 4:L, 5:A -> so third is W, not A.

Not.

""crwth"" -> C and R forbidden.

I think ""quabs"" is acceptable.

But let me check if there is a word with B and S and A in the third position, without the forbidden letters.

""quabs"" is one.

""jabs"" is 4, not 5.

""cabob"" -> C forbidden.

""adobe"" -> A-D-O-B-E -> E forbidden and also A is in position 1.

""anode"" -> N and E forbidden.

""apace"" -> A-P-A-C-E -> C and E forbidden.

""arose"" -> A-R-O-S-E -> R and E forbidden.

""ashen"" -> A-S-H-E-N -> E and N forbidden.

""atoll"" -> A-T-O-L-L -> T and L forbidden.

""avoid"" -> A-V-O-I-D -> but the pattern: A(1), V(2), O(3), I(4), D(5) -> third is O, not A.

We need the third letter to be A.

""quabs"" is a word.

Another word: ""sabat"" is not English.

""sebats"" is not common.

""sebas"" -> S-E-B-A-S -> E forbidden.

""shad"" is 4.

""shadY"" not a word.

""shig"" is 4.

""shil"" -> S-H-I-L -> L forbidden.

""shola"" -> S-H-O-L-A -> L forbidden and A in position 5.

Not.

""shorL"" -> not.

I think ""quabs"" is the only common word I can think of.

But there is also ""swabs"" -> S-W-A-B-S -> but that's 5 letters: S(1), W(2), A(3), B(4), S(5). This has two S's? But we don't know if the word has two S's.

But ""swabs"" is a word.

And it fits: S(1), W(2), A(3), B(4), S(5). But the pattern: position 1: S, 2: W, 3: A, 4: B, 5: S. So we have S in position 1 and 5.

But we know from the second guess that S is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice.

In ""blast"", we had S in position 4 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So S could be in position 1,2,5? But in this guess, we are putting S in position 1 and 5.

But we don't know if the word has two S's.

But ""swabs"" is a valid word.

And it avoids the forbidden letters: no C, R, N, E, L, T.

So, ""swabs"" is another candidate.

But ""quabs"" has Q and U, which are less common, and ""swabs"" has W and B, which are more common? But we already know B is in the word, and S is in the word.

In ""swabs"", we have S in position 1 and 5. If the word has only one S, then one of these might be x, but we know S is in the word, so at least one S must be present. If there are two S's, then we might get feedback for both.

But we are trying to find the exact positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have S in position 4 and B in position 1, but we are free to choose.

But we need to test new letters.

We have positions 1,2,4,5 to test, but we know the word has B and S, so we are testing for their positions.

In ""quabs"", we test Q and U for positions 1 and 2, and B and S for 4 and 5.

In ""swabs"", we test S for 1 and 5, and B for 4.

But we already know S is in the word, so if we put S in position 1 and it's correct, we get a ✓, or if not, we get a - or x? But if we get x for S in position 1, then we know S must be in position 5? But the word might have only one S.

Similarly, for B, we know it's in the word, so if we put B in position 4 and it's correct, we get ✓, or if not, we get - or x? But if we get x for B, then we know B must be in position 2? But position 2 is the only other open position.

But we have two open positions: 1 and 2, and 4 and 5, but we know the word has B and S, so one of them must occupy one of these positions.

But we don't know which.

To maximize information, we might want to test new letters in the open positions.

But we have to include B and S.

So, let's consider:

Option 1: ""quabs"" -> tests Q (position 1), U (position 2), B (position 4), S (position 5). But Q and U are less common, so if we get feedback that Q or U is present, it might be rare. But we have to test.

Option 2: ""swabs"" -> tests S (position 1), W (new, position 2), B (position 4), S (position 5). So we are testing S in position 1 and 5, and B in position 4.

But ""swabs"" has two S's, which might be inefficient if the word has only one S.

Option 3: ""sabs"" is 4 letters.

""abs"" is 4.

I think ""swabs"" is acceptable, but let's see if there is a word with new letters.

Another word: ""dabba"" not a word.

""gamba"" not.

""kappa"" not.

""lappa"" not.

""mappa"" not.

""pappa"" not.

""tappa"" not.

""vappa"" not.

""wappa"" not.

""yappa"" not.

""zappa"" not.

So, ""quabs"" and ""swabs"" are the only common words I can think of.

But ""quabs"" has Q and U, which are less common. ""swabs"" has W, which is more common.

But ""swabs"" has S in position 1 and 5, which might be redundant if the word has only one S.

But we don't know.

Perhaps ""pabs"" is 4, not 5.

""abs"" is 4.

Another word: ""sabat"" not English.

""sebats"" not common.

""sebas"" -> S-E-B-A-S -> E forbidden.

""shad"" is 4.

I think we should go with ""swabs"" because it uses W, which is common, and we test S in two positions.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If the word has only one S, then one of the S's might be x, and the other might be - or ✓? But we don't know.

But we are trying to get information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't repeat S, but we don't know such a word.

Another idea: ""dabba"" not English.

""gamba"" not.

""kappa"" not.

I think we have to choose between ""quabs"" and ""swabs"".

But let me check if there is a word with A in the third position, B in position 2, and S in position 5? But we need the first letter to be something.

For example: ""umbra"" -> U-M-B-R-A -> R forbidden.

""umbra"" has R.

""delta"" -> E and L forbidden.

""vodka"" -> V-O-D-K-A -> O, D, K, A. Pattern: V(1), O(2), D(3), K(4), A(5) -> third is D, not A.

Not.

""vodka"" is not.

""vixen"" -> V-I-X-E-N -> E and N forbidden.

Not.

So, I think ""swabs"" is a valid choice.

But let's see if there is a word with a new letter in position 1 and position 2.

For example, ""pawky"" -> P-A-W-K-Y -> A in position 2.

Not.

""bawky"" -> B-A-W-K-Y -> A in position 2.

Not.

""wacky"" -> W-A-C-K-Y -> C forbidden.

Not.

""jacks"" -> C forbidden.

I think we have to go with ""swabs"" or ""quabs"".

But ""quabs"" has Q and U, which are rare. ""swabs"" has W, which is more common.

But ""swabs"" has S in position 1 and 5, which might be redundant.

But it's a valid word.

Another word: ""sabat"" is not English.

""sebats"" is not common.

""sebas"" has E.

""shad"" is 4.

""shadY"" not a word.

""shil"" has L.

I found: ""sabat"" is not, but ""sabir"" is not English.

""salet"" -> S-A-L-E-T -> L, E, T forbidden.

Not.

""salad"" -> S-A-L-A-D -> L forbidden and A in position 2.

Not.

""salts"" -> S-A-L-T-S -> L and T forbidden.

Not.

""smalt"" -> S-M-A-L-T -> L and T forbidden.

Not.

""spalt"" -> S-P-A-L-T -> L and T forbidden.

Not.

""staid"" -> S-T-A-I-D -> T forbidden.

Not.

""swAMI"" -> not 5 letters? ""swami"" is 5: S-W-A-M-I -> but the pattern: S(1), W(2), A(3), M(4), I(5). This avoids forbidden letters? S, W, A, M, I. A is allowed, S is allowed, W is new, M is new, I is new.

And ""swami"" is a word.

But we have to check if it fits: the word has S, A, and B? No, ""swami"" does not have B. But we know the word has B, so ""swami"" cannot be the word because it doesn't have B.

We must include B.

So, ""swami"" is invalid because it lacks B.

Similarly, ""quabs"" has B and S.

""quabs"": Q-U-A-B-S -> includes B and S.

""swabs"": S-W-A-B-S -> includes B and S.

Another word: ""jabs"" is 4, not 5.

""abs"" is 4.

""babs"" is 4.

""dabs"" is 4.

""habs"" is 4.

""labs"" is 4 and L forbidden.

""mabs"" is 4.

""pabs"" is 4.

""tabs"" is 4 and T forbidden.

So, 5-letter words with A in the third position, containing B and S, and without C, R, N, E, L, T.

""quabs"" and ""swabs"" are the only common ones I can think of.

""quabs"" has U, which is a vowel, and Q is a consonant.

""swabs"" has W, which is a consonant, and S repeated.

But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

Another possibility: ""sabat"" is not, but ""sabir"" is not English.

""salet"" is not.

""salad"" is not.

""salts"" is not.

""smalt"" is not.

""spalt"" is not.

""staid"" is not because T is forbidden.

""swAMI"" is not because it doesn't have B.

So, I think we have to choose between ""quabs"" and ""swabs"".

But let me try ""swabs"": S-W-A-B-S.

But we are putting S in position 1 and 5. If the word has only one S, then one of them might be x, and the other might be - or ✓? But we don't know.

But we are testing the positions.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have S in position 4 and B in position 1, but we don't have many options.

Another word: ""dabba"" not English.

""gamba"" not.

""kappa"" not.

""lappa"" not.

""mappa"" not.

""pappa"" not.

""tappa"" not.

""vappa"" not.

""wappa"" not.

""yappa"" not.

""zappa"" not.

So, I think ""swabs"" is a valid guess.

But we can also consider ""quabs"", but Q and U are rare.

Perhaps ""pabs"" is 4, but we can't make a 5-letter word.

Another word: ""sabat"" is not, but ""sabir"" is not English.

""salet"" is not.

""salad"" not.

""salts"" not.

""smalt"" not.

""spalt"" not.

""staid"" not.

""swAMI"" not.

So, I think we have to go with ""swabs"".

But let me confirm: ""swabs"" is a valid English word.

So, third guess: ""swabs"".

But note: we are testing S in position 1 and 5, and B in position 4.

If we get:
- S in position 1: if it's correct, we get ✓, if not, we get x (but if x, then S must be in position 5, since we know S is in the word and not in 4, and position 1 is tested).

Similarly for B: we are putting B in position 4. If it's correct, we get ✓, if not, we get x, meaning B must be in position 2? But position 2 is the only other open position.

But if B is not in position 4, then it must be in position 2? But we don't have B in position 2 in this guess.

In this guess, we are not testing position 2 for B.

But we know B is in the word, so if we don't get a ✓ for B in position 4, then we know B must be in position 2? But we are not testing position 2 for B in this guess.

In ""swabs"", we are testing:
- Position 1: S (if S is in the word, we get feedback: if S is in position 1, ✓; if not, but S is in the word, so if not in 1, then it must be in 5? But we are also testing position 5 for S.

Similarly for B: position 4.

But we know B is in the word, so if we get x for B in position 4, then B must be in position 2? But we don't have a guess with B in position 2.

We have to include B.

Another word: ""dabba"" not English.

""gamba"" not.

""kappa"" not.

I think we have to accept that ""quabs"" or ""swabs"" are the best we can do.

But let me try ""quabs"": Q-U-A-B-S.

But Q is uncommon, and U is a vowel, but we don't know if vowels are allowed elsewhere? We know A is in the word, but we don't know about other vowels.

But the word must have vowels? Probably.

But we know E is not in the word, so other vowels: A is already used, but we can have I, O, U.

In ""quabs"", we have U, which is a vowel.

But we have to avoid E, which we are.

But I think ""swabs"" is more common? Or ""quabs"".

But to be safe, let's choose ""swabs"".

But we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters, but we don't have evidence.

Another word: ""sabat"" is not English.

""sebats"" is not common.

""sebas"" has E.

I think ""swabs"" is a reasonable choice.

But let me see if there is a word with B in position 2 and S in position 5? For example, ""umbra"" is not, because no B.

""umbra"" has R.

""delta"" has E and L.

Not.

""vodka"" has O, D, K, A, but no B.

Not.

So, I think we have to go with ""swabs"".

But let's try ""swabs"".

So, third guess: ""swabs"".

But note: we are not forced to include B in this guess? We know B is in the word, but we are not including it? That would be inefficient because we need to find the position of B.

We know B is in the word, so we should include it to get information about its position.

Similarly for S.

So, we must include both B and S in the guess.

Therefore, ""swabs"" is a good choice because it includes B and S, and A in position 3.

So, I'll go with ""swabs"".

But let me double-check the feedback.

In the second guess, we had ""blast"": B(-) L(x) A(✓) S(-) T(x)

So, B is in the word, not in position 1. S is in the word, not in position 4.

So for ""swabs"": 
- Position 1: S -> if the word has S in position 1, we get ✓; if not, we get x. But if we get x for S in position 1, then S must be in position 5? Because we know S is in the word and not in 4, so it must be in 1 or 5. If we get x for S in position 1, then S must be in position 5.

Similarly, for B: position 4. If we get x for B, then B must be in position 2? Because we know B is in the word and not in 1, and positions 4 and 5 are open, but we are putting B in 4, and if it's not there, then it must be in 2? But we don't have a guess with B in position 2.

But we will have to infer.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has B in position 2 and S in position 5? But we don't know such a word.

For example, ""umbra"" is not.

""umbra"" has R.

Not.

""delta"" not.

I think it's impossible to test position 2 for B without using forbidden letters.

So, we have to choose between ""quabs"" and ""swabs"".

I think ""swabs"" is more common.

But let's see the frequency.

Another word: ""sabat"" is not, but ""sabir"" is not English.

""salet"" is not.

""salad"" not.

""salts"" not.

""smalt"" not.

""spalt"" not.

""staid"" not.

So, I think ""swabs"" is a valid guess.

We'll guess ""swabs"".

But note: we are using S in position 1 and 5. If the word has only one S, then one of them might be x, and the other might be ✓ or -.

But we can get information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has B in position 2 and S in position 4? But S cannot be in position 4? The feedback said S is not in position 4, so we cannot put S in position 4.

In ""swabs"", we are putting S in position 1 and 5, not 4.

Position 4 is B.

So, I think it's fine.

So, third guess: ""swabs"".

But let me write it: S-W-A-B-S.

So, <guess>swabs</guess>

But we must output in the format.

But before that, we have to think step by step.

Step-by-step:

1. We know the word has A in position 3 and contains B and S, which are not in position 1 (for B, not position 1; for S, not position 4) and the word does not contain C, R, N, E, L, T.

2. So the pattern is _ _ A _ _.

3. We need to include B and S in the guess to test their positions.

4. We choose ""swabs"" because it has S in position 1 and 5, and B in position 4, and avoids forbidden letters, and it's a common word.

5. This guess will help us locate B and S.

6. If we get feedback that S in position 1 is x, then S must be in position 5, and similarly for B.

But we are also testing W and the second S.

So, I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, we guess ""swabs"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(x)  
  - A is in the word and correctly placed in position 3.  
  - C, R, N, E are not in the word.  
- **Guess 2: blast** → Feedback: B(-), L(x), A(✓), S(-), T(x)  
  - A is confirmed in position 3.  
  - B and S are in the word but not in positions 1 or 4, respectively.  
  - L and T are not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word pattern: `_ _ A _ _` (A is fixed in position 3).  
- Confirmed letters: **A** (position 3), **B** (somewhere, not position 1), **S** (somewhere, not position 4).  
- Forbidden letters: C, R, N, E, L, T.  
- Remaining positions to solve: 1, 2, 4, 5.  
- B must be in position 2, 4, or 5 (since not 1).  
- S must be in position 2, 5 (since not 4).  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- We must include **B** and **S** to test their positions, as they are confirmed present.  
- Avoid forbidden letters (C, R, N, E, L, T).  
- Test new common letters for the remaining open positions (e.g., D, G, H, I, M, P, Y) to maximize information.  
- The word must fit `_ _ A _ _`, with B and S placed appropriately (B not in 1, S not in 4).  

### Why ""swabs""?
- **S** in position 1 and 5: Tests if S is in position 1 or 5 (or both).  
- **W** in position 2: Tests a new common consonant.  
- **A** in position 3: Confirmed correct (so ✓).  
- **B** in position 4: Tests if B is in position 4 (or if it's elsewhere).  
- **S** in position 5: Tests if S is in position 5 (or if it's duplicated).  
- Avoids forbidden letters (no C, R, N, E, L, T).  

""swabs"" is a valid 5-letter word that fits the constraints and tests key positions for B and S. If S is in position 1, we get ✓; if not, we learn it must be in position 5. Similarly, B in position 4: if ✓, we lock it; if -, we know B must be in position 2 (since it's the only other option).",Guess 3: swabs -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) W(✓) A(✓) B(✓) S(✓),SUCCESS
