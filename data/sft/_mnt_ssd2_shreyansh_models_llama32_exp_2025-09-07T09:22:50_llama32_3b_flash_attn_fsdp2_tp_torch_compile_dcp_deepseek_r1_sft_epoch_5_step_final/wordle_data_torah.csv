We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make the next guess.

 We need to choose a word that:
 1. Includes R and A (because they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
    - R was in position 2, so in the next guess, R should not be in position 2? Actually, it can be in any position except that we know it's not the second? 
      But note: the feedback says R is in the word but not in position 2. So R must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us about the position we guessed. 
      It doesn't prevent R from being in position 2? Wait, no: because if R were in position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so R is in the word but not at position 2.

 2. Does not include C, N, E.

 Also, we want to include new common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of a word that has R and A, and avoids C, N, E.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 We know R is in the word, so we can try to put R in a different position. Similarly for A.

 Possible positions for R: since it was in position 2 and that was wrong, we can try position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, A was in position 3 and that was wrong, so we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 But note: we don't know if R and A are the only letters they are. There might be more.

 We should try to cover more common letters.

 Let me try to think of a word that has R and A, and also includes other common consonants and vowels.

 Example: ""ROAST"" - but we have to avoid E? Actually, we can use any letter except C, N, E.

 However, note that ""crane"" had R in position 2 and A in position 3. So in ""roast"":
  R in position 1 -> if the secret word has R in position 1, then it would be correct. But we don't know that.
  O is new, A in position 2? But wait, A was in position 3 in the first guess and now we are putting A in position 2. That might be okay.

 But let's check the letters: R, O, A, S, T.

 We know R and A are in the word, so that's good.

 We are avoiding C, N, E.

 However, we must consider that the feedback for R and A might be in the same positions as before? But we are changing the positions.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that puts R and A in positions that are not the ones we already tried.

 Another idea: we can try to use a word that has R and A and also includes other common letters to test.

 Let me list some words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

 Possible words: 
   ""PARTY"" -> but we don't know if P, T, Y are in the word? And note: we have to avoid C, N, E.
   ""RADAR"" -> but that has two R's and two A's? We don't know if the word has duplicates.

 But we don't have any information about duplicates yet.

 However, we want to maximize new information. So we should try to use as many new letters as possible.

 Another common word: ""TRAIL"" -> but that has L and I, and avoids C, N, E.

 But note: we have to be cautious because we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

 Since we have only one R and one A in the feedback? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates. For example, if the word had two R's, then if we guess one R in the wrong position and one in the right, we would see two '-' for R? But in our case, we only have one R in the guess and it was marked as present but wrong position. So there is at least one R. But there could be more.

 Similarly for A.

 However, to keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Let me try to form a word without C, N, E, and with R and A in positions that are not 2 and 3 respectively.

 We can try:
   Position 1: R? -> but then we have R at position 1. But we don't know if that's correct. We can try R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, A can be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 I think a good next guess would be ""ROAST"" or ""TRAIL"", but let me think of one.

 Another idea: ""RAISE"" -> but E is not allowed? We cannot use E because we know it's not in the word. So avoid E.

 How about ""RAILS""? But that has S at the end. But note: we don't know about S.

 Alternatively, ""PARTS"" -> but we have to avoid E? Actually, we can use any letter except C, N, E.

 But wait: we have to avoid C, N, E. So ""PARTS"" is okay? But ""PARTS"" has P, A, R, T, S.

 However, we are not sure about P, T, S.

 Let me think of a word that uses more common letters.

 How about ""STARK""? 
   S, T, A, R, K.

 But note: we have to avoid E? Yes, and we are avoiding C, N, E.

 However, we are not sure about S, T, K.

 Another common word: ""STAMP"" -> but we have to avoid E? Yes, and it doesn't have E. But it has M and P.

 But we don't know about M and P.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"" (R at 1, O at 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5). But wait, in the first guess, A was at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 again, we would get the same feedback? Actually, we know A is not at position 3, so we should avoid putting A at position 3.

 So in ""ROAST"", A is at position 3 again. That would be a waste because we already know A is not at position 3.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting A at position 3 and R at position 2.

 So ""ROAST"" is not good because A is at position 3.

 How about ""ROARS""? But that has two R's and two A's? We don't want to duplicate if we can avoid it.

 Another word: ""PARTY"" -> P, A, R, T, Y.
   A is at position 2 (which is new) and R is at position 3 (which is new for R, because previously it was at 2). So that's good.

 But we don't know about P, T, Y.

 Alternatively, ""RATIO"" -> but that has O and I, and T. But note: we have to avoid E? Yes. However, we have R at position 1, A at position 2, T at 3, I at 4, O at 5.

 But we know that R is in the word, so putting R at position 1 is a new position. Similarly, A at position 2 is new.

 However, we also know that R is not at position 2 (from the first guess) but we are putting it at 1. That's fine.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess said R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 1, then if the secret word has R at position 1, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R is at position 1 is wrong, so it must be at 3,4, or 5.

 Similarly, A was at position 3 and now we put it at position 2.

 Let me consider ""RATIO"". But note: we are also testing I and O.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RASPY"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, S at 3, P at 4, Y at 5.

 But we don't know about S, P, Y.

 Another common word: ""RADIO"" -> but that has D and I and O. Also, A is at position 2 and R at 1.

 But we are avoiding C, N, E, so that's okay.

 However, we have to be cautious: we don't want to reuse positions for R and A that we already know are wrong? Actually, we are forced to put R in a new position (because we can't put it at position 2). Similarly, A must be in a new position (not 3).

 In ""RADIO"": 
   R is at position 1 (new) and A is at position 2 (new). So that's good.

 But we are also testing D, I, O.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RAPID"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, P at 3, I at 4, D at 5.

 Again, we are testing new letters.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters (C, N, E). ""RAPID"" doesn't have any of these.

 However, we have a problem: we know that the secret word has R and A, but we don't know if they are in the positions we are about to try. We are trying R at 1 and A at 2. If the secret word has R at 1, then we get a ✓ for R. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R must be at 3,4, or 5. Similarly for A.

 But we are also testing P, I, D.

 Another word: ""TRAIL"" -> T at 1, R at 2? Wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we already know that position 2 is not R. So we must avoid putting R at position 2.

 In ""TRAIL"", R is at position 2 -> that's the same as the first guess? And we know it's not at position 2. So we would get a '-' for R again? But we already know that. So that doesn't give new information about R's position? Actually, we would get a '-' again for R at position 2, but we already know that. So we should avoid that.

 Therefore, we want to avoid putting R at position 2 and A at position 3.

 So ""TRAIL"" is not good because R is at position 2.

 How about ""BRAVE""? But we have E? No, we cannot use E. So avoid.

 How about ""BRAID""? 
   B, R, A, I, D -> R is at position 2? Again, we must avoid position 2 for R.

 So we need a word that has R and A, and puts R in a position other than 2, and A in a position other than 3.

 Let me try to put R at position 1 and A at position 4? For example, ""ROTAL"" (which is not a word) or ""RADIO"" (as before) or ""RAPID"" (as before).

 ""RADIO"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, D at 3, I at 4, O at 5.

 This avoids putting R at position 2 and A at position 3.

 Similarly, ""RAPID"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, P at 3, I at 4, D at 5.

 Both are valid words.

 But which one is better? We want to test more common letters.

 Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 ""RADIO"" uses D, I, O.
 ""RAPID"" uses P, I, D.

 S and T are very common. So maybe we should include S and T.

 How about ""RASPY"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, S at 3, P at 4, Y at 5.

 This has S and P.

 But we don't know if the word has S or P.

 Another word: ""RASIS"" -> but that has two S's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

 I think ""RASPY"" is acceptable, but Y is less common.

 How about ""RATIO"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, T at 3, I at 4, O at 5.

 This has T and I and O.

 But note: we have to avoid E, which we are.

 However, we have two vowels (A and I, O) and two consonants (R, T). We already know R and A are in the word, so we are testing T, I, O.

 But we don't know if T, I, O are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has S and T.

 How about ""RASTS""? -> duplicate S? and we don't know if duplicates exist.

 I think ""RATIO"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and we can get good information.

 But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

 Another word: ""ROAST"" is not good because A is at position 3 (which we know is wrong for A).

 How about ""ROAST"" is R at 1, O at 2, A at 3 (which we know is wrong) -> so we would get a '-' for A? But we already know A is not at position 3. So we don't learn anything new? Actually, we would learn that A is not at position 3 (if we get a '-') but we already know that. So it's a waste of a position.

 Therefore, we avoid putting A at position 3 and R at position 2.

 So let's choose between ""RADIO"", ""RAPID"", ""RATIO"", ""RASPY"", etc.

 I think ""RATIO"" is a good choice because it uses T, I, O which are common.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters (C, N, E). ""RATIO"" doesn't have any of these.

 So I'll go with ""RATIO"".

 However, let me check: 
   R at position 1: if the secret word has R at position 1, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R must be at 3,4, or 5.
   A at position 2: similarly, if the secret word has A at position 2, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know A must be at 1,4, or 5.

 But note: we are also testing T at 3, I at 4, O at 5.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STAIR"": 
   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3? Wait, we cannot put A at position 3 because we already know that position 3 is not A. So we must avoid that.

 How about ""STAIR"" is invalid because A is at position 3.

 How about ""STRAY"": 
   S, T, R, A, Y -> R is at position 3? (because S at 1, T at 2, R at 3, A at 4, Y at 5). 
   This avoids position 2 for R (we are putting R at 3) and A at position 4 (which is new, because previously A was at 3).

 So ""STRAY"" has:
   S (new), T (new), R (at position 3, which is new), A (at position 4, new), Y (new).

 This seems good.

 But we don't know if S, T, Y are in the word.

 Alternatively, ""STARK"": 
   S, T, A, R, K -> A at position 3? We cannot put A at position 3. So invalid.

 How about ""START"": 
   S, T, A, R, T -> but duplicate T? And A is at position 3? We cannot put A at position 3.

 So ""START"" is invalid.

 How about ""PARTY"": 
   P, A, R, T, Y -> A at position 2 (new), R at position 3 (new, because previously R was at 2). So that's good.

 But we have to avoid E? Yes.

 However, we have two good candidates: ""RATIO"", ""RAPID"", ""STRAY"", ""RASPY"".

 I think ""STRAY"" is a good choice because it uses S and T, which are very common, and we avoid putting R at position 2 and A at position 3.

 But note: in ""STRAY"", we have R at position 3 and A at position 4. This is acceptable.

 Alternatively, ""RAPID"" has R at 1, A at 2, P at 3, I at 4, D at 5.

 Which one is better? 

 We want to test as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know E and N are out. So T, O, I, S are good.

 ""RATIO"" has T, I, O.
 ""RAPID"" has P, I, D.
 ""STRAY"" has S, T, Y.

 ""RATIO"" and ""STRAY"" have T and S.

 But ""RATIO"" has the advantage of having two vowels (I and O) which might be useful.

 However, we already know that the word has at least one vowel? Actually, we don't know about duplicates. But we know the word has at least one vowel (A) so far.

 I think ""RATIO"" is a good choice.

 But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have the letter R at position 1? We don't know. So let's test that.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RAISE"" but E is not allowed.

 How about ""RAILS"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.

 This avoids the known bad positions: R is not at 2 (we are putting it at 1) and A is not at 3 (we are putting it at 2). So that's good.

 But we are testing L and S.

 I think ""RAILS"" is a valid word and uses common letters.

 However, we have to decide.

 Let me choose ""RATIO"" because it tests T, I, O.

 So my next guess: ""RATIO""

 But note: we are not forced to use R and A in the next guess? Actually, we are: because we know they are in the word? No, we are not required to use them, but if we don't, we might miss the chance to get more information about their positions.

 However, we can choose not to use R and A? But that might be inefficient because we already know they are in the word. We want to test new positions for R and A.

 So I think we should include R and A.

 Therefore, I choose ""RATIO"".

<guess>ratio</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** and **A** (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing **R** at position 2 or **A** at position 3.
- Must **avoid C, N, E** entirely.
- Should test new common letters (e.g., **T, I, O**) to gather more information.

The word **""RATIO""** fits these criteria:
- Places **R** at position 1 (new position, not tested before).
- Places **A** at position 2 (new position, since it was at position 3 in ""crane"").
- Introduces **T, I, O** (untested letters).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, N, E) and duplicates.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and A while testing three new letters.

<guess>ratio</guess>",ratio,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make the next guess.

 We need to choose a word that:
 1. Includes R and A (because they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
    - R was in position 2, so in the next guess, R should not be in position 2? Actually, it can be in any position except that we know it's not the second? 
      But note: the feedback says R is in the word but not in position 2. So R must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us about the position we guessed. 
      It doesn't prevent R from being in position 2? Wait, no: because if R were in position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so R is in the word but not at position 2.

 2. Does not include C, N, E.

 Also, we want to include new common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of a word that has R and A, and avoids C, N, E.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 We know R is in the word, so we can try to put R in a different position. Similarly for A.

 Possible positions for R: since it was in position 2 and that was wrong, we can try position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, A was in position 3 and that was wrong, so we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 But note: we don't know if R and A are the only letters they are. There might be more.

 We should try to cover more common letters.

 Let me try to think of a word that has R and A, and also includes other common consonants and vowels.

 Example: ""ROAST"" - but we have to avoid E? Actually, we can use any letter except C, N, E.

 However, note that ""crane"" had R in position 2 and A in position 3. So in ""roast"":
  R in position 1 -> if the secret word has R in position 1, then it would be correct. But we don't know that.
  O is new, A in position 2? But wait, A was in position 3 in the first guess and now we are putting A in position 2. That might be okay.

 But let's check the letters: R, O, A, S, T.

 We know R and A are in the word, so that's good.

 We are avoiding C, N, E.

 However, we must consider that the feedback for R and A might be in the same positions as before? But we are changing the positions.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that puts R and A in positions that are not the ones we already tried.

 Another idea: we can try to use a word that has R and A and also includes other common letters to test.

 Let me list some words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

 Possible words: 
   ""PARTY"" -> but we don't know if P, T, Y are in the word? And note: we have to avoid C, N, E.
   ""RADAR"" -> but that has two R's and two A's? We don't know if the word has duplicates.

 But we don't have any information about duplicates yet.

 However, we want to maximize new information. So we should try to use as many new letters as possible.

 Another common word: ""TRAIL"" -> but that has L and I, and avoids C, N, E.

 But note: we have to be cautious because we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

 Since we have only one R and one A in the feedback? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates. For example, if the word had two R's, then if we guess one R in the wrong position and one in the right, we would see two '-' for R? But in our case, we only have one R in the guess and it was marked as present but wrong position. So there is at least one R. But there could be more.

 Similarly for A.

 However, to keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Let me try to form a word without C, N, E, and with R and A in positions that are not 2 and 3 respectively.

 We can try:
   Position 1: R? -> but then we have R at position 1. But we don't know if that's correct. We can try R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, A can be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 I think a good next guess would be ""ROAST"" or ""TRAIL"", but let me think of one.

 Another idea: ""RAISE"" -> but E is not allowed? We cannot use E because we know it's not in the word. So avoid E.

 How about ""RAILS""? But that has S at the end. But note: we don't know about S.

 Alternatively, ""PARTS"" -> but we have to avoid E? Actually, we can use any letter except C, N, E.

 But wait: we have to avoid C, N, E. So ""PARTS"" is okay? But ""PARTS"" has P, A, R, T, S.

 However, we are not sure about P, T, S.

 Let me think of a word that uses more common letters.

 How about ""STARK""? 
   S, T, A, R, K.

 But note: we have to avoid E? Yes, and we are avoiding C, N, E.

 However, we are not sure about S, T, K.

 Another common word: ""STAMP"" -> but we have to avoid E? Yes, and it doesn't have E. But it has M and P.

 But we don't know about M and P.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"" (R at 1, O at 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5). But wait, in the first guess, A was at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 again, we would get the same feedback? Actually, we know A is not at position 3, so we should avoid putting A at position 3.

 So in ""ROAST"", A is at position 3 again. That would be a waste because we already know A is not at position 3.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting A at position 3 and R at position 2.

 So ""ROAST"" is not good because A is at position 3.

 How about ""ROARS""? But that has two R's and two A's? We don't want to duplicate if we can avoid it.

 Another word: ""PARTY"" -> P, A, R, T, Y.
   A is at position 2 (which is new) and R is at position 3 (which is new for R, because previously it was at 2). So that's good.

 But we don't know about P, T, Y.

 Alternatively, ""RATIO"" -> but that has O and I, and T. But note: we have to avoid E? Yes. However, we have R at position 1, A at position 2, T at 3, I at 4, O at 5.

 But we know that R is in the word, so putting R at position 1 is a new position. Similarly, A at position 2 is new.

 However, we also know that R is not at position 2 (from the first guess) but we are putting it at 1. That's fine.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess said R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 1, then if the secret word has R at position 1, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R is at position 1 is wrong, so it must be at 3,4, or 5.

 Similarly, A was at position 3 and now we put it at position 2.

 Let me consider ""RATIO"". But note: we are also testing I and O.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RASPY"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, S at 3, P at 4, Y at 5.

 But we don't know about S, P, Y.

 Another common word: ""RADIO"" -> but that has D and I and O. Also, A is at position 2 and R at 1.

 But we are avoiding C, N, E, so that's okay.

 However, we have to be cautious: we don't want to reuse positions for R and A that we already know are wrong? Actually, we are forced to put R in a new position (because we can't put it at position 2). Similarly, A must be in a new position (not 3).

 In ""RADIO"": 
   R is at position 1 (new) and A is at position 2 (new). So that's good.

 But we are also testing D, I, O.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RAPID"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, P at 3, I at 4, D at 5.

 Again, we are testing new letters.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters (C, N, E). ""RAPID"" doesn't have any of these.

 However, we have a problem: we know that the secret word has R and A, but we don't know if they are in the positions we are about to try. We are trying R at 1 and A at 2. If the secret word has R at 1, then we get a ✓ for R. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R must be at 3,4, or 5. Similarly for A.

 But we are also testing P, I, D.

 Another word: ""TRAIL"" -> T at 1, R at 2? Wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we already know that position 2 is not R. So we must avoid putting R at position 2.

 In ""TRAIL"", R is at position 2 -> that's the same as the first guess? And we know it's not at position 2. So we would get a '-' for R again? But we already know that. So that doesn't give new information about R's position? Actually, we would get a '-' again for R at position 2, but we already know that. So we should avoid that.

 Therefore, we want to avoid putting R at position 2 and A at position 3.

 So ""TRAIL"" is not good because R is at position 2.

 How about ""BRAVE""? But we have E? No, we cannot use E. So avoid.

 How about ""BRAID""? 
   B, R, A, I, D -> R is at position 2? Again, we must avoid position 2 for R.

 So we need a word that has R and A, and puts R in a position other than 2, and A in a position other than 3.

 Let me try to put R at position 1 and A at position 4? For example, ""ROTAL"" (which is not a word) or ""RADIO"" (as before) or ""RAPID"" (as before).

 ""RADIO"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, D at 3, I at 4, O at 5.

 This avoids putting R at position 2 and A at position 3.

 Similarly, ""RAPID"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, P at 3, I at 4, D at 5.

 Both are valid words.

 But which one is better? We want to test more common letters.

 Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 ""RADIO"" uses D, I, O.
 ""RAPID"" uses P, I, D.

 S and T are very common. So maybe we should include S and T.

 How about ""RASPY"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, S at 3, P at 4, Y at 5.

 This has S and P.

 But we don't know if the word has S or P.

 Another word: ""RASIS"" -> but that has two S's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

 I think ""RASPY"" is acceptable, but Y is less common.

 How about ""RATIO"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, T at 3, I at 4, O at 5.

 This has T and I and O.

 But note: we have to avoid E, which we are.

 However, we have two vowels (A and I, O) and two consonants (R, T). We already know R and A are in the word, so we are testing T, I, O.

 But we don't know if T, I, O are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has S and T.

 How about ""RASTS""? -> duplicate S? and we don't know if duplicates exist.

 I think ""RATIO"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and we can get good information.

 But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

 Another word: ""ROAST"" is not good because A is at position 3 (which we know is wrong for A).

 How about ""ROAST"" is R at 1, O at 2, A at 3 (which we know is wrong) -> so we would get a '-' for A? But we already know A is not at position 3. So we don't learn anything new? Actually, we would learn that A is not at position 3 (if we get a '-') but we already know that. So it's a waste of a position.

 Therefore, we avoid putting A at position 3 and R at position 2.

 So let's choose between ""RADIO"", ""RAPID"", ""RATIO"", ""RASPY"", etc.

 I think ""RATIO"" is a good choice because it uses T, I, O which are common.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters (C, N, E). ""RATIO"" doesn't have any of these.

 So I'll go with ""RATIO"".

 However, let me check: 
   R at position 1: if the secret word has R at position 1, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R must be at 3,4, or 5.
   A at position 2: similarly, if the secret word has A at position 2, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know A must be at 1,4, or 5.

 But note: we are also testing T at 3, I at 4, O at 5.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STAIR"": 
   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3? Wait, we cannot put A at position 3 because we already know that position 3 is not A. So we must avoid that.

 How about ""STAIR"" is invalid because A is at position 3.

 How about ""STRAY"": 
   S, T, R, A, Y -> R is at position 3? (because S at 1, T at 2, R at 3, A at 4, Y at 5). 
   This avoids position 2 for R (we are putting R at 3) and A at position 4 (which is new, because previously A was at 3).

 So ""STRAY"" has:
   S (new), T (new), R (at position 3, which is new), A (at position 4, new), Y (new).

 This seems good.

 But we don't know if S, T, Y are in the word.

 Alternatively, ""STARK"": 
   S, T, A, R, K -> A at position 3? We cannot put A at position 3. So invalid.

 How about ""START"": 
   S, T, A, R, T -> but duplicate T? And A is at position 3? We cannot put A at position 3.

 So ""START"" is invalid.

 How about ""PARTY"": 
   P, A, R, T, Y -> A at position 2 (new), R at position 3 (new, because previously R was at 2). So that's good.

 But we have to avoid E? Yes.

 However, we have two good candidates: ""RATIO"", ""RAPID"", ""STRAY"", ""RASPY"".

 I think ""STRAY"" is a good choice because it uses S and T, which are very common, and we avoid putting R at position 2 and A at position 3.

 But note: in ""STRAY"", we have R at position 3 and A at position 4. This is acceptable.

 Alternatively, ""RAPID"" has R at 1, A at 2, P at 3, I at 4, D at 5.

 Which one is better? 

 We want to test as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know E and N are out. So T, O, I, S are good.

 ""RATIO"" has T, I, O.
 ""RAPID"" has P, I, D.
 ""STRAY"" has S, T, Y.

 ""RATIO"" and ""STRAY"" have T and S.

 But ""RATIO"" has the advantage of having two vowels (I and O) which might be useful.

 However, we already know that the word has at least one vowel? Actually, we don't know about duplicates. But we know the word has at least one vowel (A) so far.

 I think ""RATIO"" is a good choice.

 But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have the letter R at position 1? We don't know. So let's test that.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RAISE"" but E is not allowed.

 How about ""RAILS"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.

 This avoids the known bad positions: R is not at 2 (we are putting it at 1) and A is not at 3 (we are putting it at 2). So that's good.

 But we are testing L and S.

 I think ""RAILS"" is a valid word and uses common letters.

 However, we have to decide.

 Let me choose ""RATIO"" because it tests T, I, O.

 So my next guess: ""RATIO""

 But note: we are not forced to use R and A in the next guess? Actually, we are: because we know they are in the word? No, we are not required to use them, but if we don't, we might miss the chance to get more information about their positions.

 However, we can choose not to use R and A? But that might be inefficient because we already know they are in the word. We want to test new positions for R and A.

 So I think we should include R and A.

 Therefore, I choose ""RATIO"".

<guess>ratio</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** and **A** (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing **R** at position 2 or **A** at position 3.
- Must **avoid C, N, E** entirely.
- Should test new common letters (e.g., **T, I, O**) to gather more information.

The word **""RATIO""** fits these criteria:
- Places **R** at position 1 (new position, not tested before).
- Places **A** at position 2 (new position, since it was at position 3 in ""crane"").
- Introduces **T, I, O** (untested letters).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, N, E) and duplicates.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and A while testing three new letters.",Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(-) I(x) O(-),FAIL

Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023
Today Date: 07 Sep 2025

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make your first 5-letter word guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: x (not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters R and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
   Specifically, R is not the second letter, and A is not the third letter.
 - The letters C, N, and E are not in the word at all.

 Since we have 6 tries, we can use this information to make the next guess.

 We need to choose a word that:
 1. Includes R and A (because they are in the secret word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
    - R was in position 2, so in the next guess, R should not be in position 2? Actually, it can be in any position except that we know it's not the second? 
      But note: the feedback says R is in the word but not in position 2. So R must be in one of positions 1,3,4,5? Actually, no: the feedback only tells us about the position we guessed. 
      It doesn't prevent R from being in position 2? Wait, no: because if R were in position 2, it would have been marked as correct (✓). But it was marked as present but wrong position (-), so R is in the word but not at position 2.

 2. Does not include C, N, E.

 Also, we want to include new common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of a word that has R and A, and avoids C, N, E.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 We know R is in the word, so we can try to put R in a different position. Similarly for A.

 Possible positions for R: since it was in position 2 and that was wrong, we can try position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, A was in position 3 and that was wrong, so we can try position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 But note: we don't know if R and A are the only letters they are. There might be more.

 We should try to cover more common letters.

 Let me try to think of a word that has R and A, and also includes other common consonants and vowels.

 Example: ""ROAST"" - but we have to avoid E? Actually, we can use any letter except C, N, E.

 However, note that ""crane"" had R in position 2 and A in position 3. So in ""roast"":
  R in position 1 -> if the secret word has R in position 1, then it would be correct. But we don't know that.
  O is new, A in position 2? But wait, A was in position 3 in the first guess and now we are putting A in position 2. That might be okay.

 But let's check the letters: R, O, A, S, T.

 We know R and A are in the word, so that's good.

 We are avoiding C, N, E.

 However, we must consider that the feedback for R and A might be in the same positions as before? But we are changing the positions.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that puts R and A in positions that are not the ones we already tried.

 Another idea: we can try to use a word that has R and A and also includes other common letters to test.

 Let me list some words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

 Possible words: 
   ""PARTY"" -> but we don't know if P, T, Y are in the word? And note: we have to avoid C, N, E.
   ""RADAR"" -> but that has two R's and two A's? We don't know if the word has duplicates.

 But we don't have any information about duplicates yet.

 However, we want to maximize new information. So we should try to use as many new letters as possible.

 Another common word: ""TRAIL"" -> but that has L and I, and avoids C, N, E.

 But note: we have to be cautious because we don't know if the word has duplicate letters.

 Since we have only one R and one A in the feedback? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates. For example, if the word had two R's, then if we guess one R in the wrong position and one in the right, we would see two '-' for R? But in our case, we only have one R in the guess and it was marked as present but wrong position. So there is at least one R. But there could be more.

 Similarly for A.

 However, to keep it simple, let's avoid duplicates for now.

 Let me try to form a word without C, N, E, and with R and A in positions that are not 2 and 3 respectively.

 We can try:
   Position 1: R? -> but then we have R at position 1. But we don't know if that's correct. We can try R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

 Similarly, A can be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 I think a good next guess would be ""ROAST"" or ""TRAIL"", but let me think of one.

 Another idea: ""RAISE"" -> but E is not allowed? We cannot use E because we know it's not in the word. So avoid E.

 How about ""RAILS""? But that has S at the end. But note: we don't know about S.

 Alternatively, ""PARTS"" -> but we have to avoid E? Actually, we can use any letter except C, N, E.

 But wait: we have to avoid C, N, E. So ""PARTS"" is okay? But ""PARTS"" has P, A, R, T, S.

 However, we are not sure about P, T, S.

 Let me think of a word that uses more common letters.

 How about ""STARK""? 
   S, T, A, R, K.

 But note: we have to avoid E? Yes, and we are avoiding C, N, E.

 However, we are not sure about S, T, K.

 Another common word: ""STAMP"" -> but we have to avoid E? Yes, and it doesn't have E. But it has M and P.

 But we don't know about M and P.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"" (R at 1, O at 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5). But wait, in the first guess, A was at position 3 and we got a '-' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 again, we would get the same feedback? Actually, we know A is not at position 3, so we should avoid putting A at position 3.

 So in ""ROAST"", A is at position 3 again. That would be a waste because we already know A is not at position 3.

 Therefore, we should avoid putting A at position 3 and R at position 2.

 So ""ROAST"" is not good because A is at position 3.

 How about ""ROARS""? But that has two R's and two A's? We don't want to duplicate if we can avoid it.

 Another word: ""PARTY"" -> P, A, R, T, Y.
   A is at position 2 (which is new) and R is at position 3 (which is new for R, because previously it was at 2). So that's good.

 But we don't know about P, T, Y.

 Alternatively, ""RATIO"" -> but that has O and I, and T. But note: we have to avoid E? Yes. However, we have R at position 1, A at position 2, T at 3, I at 4, O at 5.

 But we know that R is in the word, so putting R at position 1 is a new position. Similarly, A at position 2 is new.

 However, we also know that R is not at position 2 (from the first guess) but we are putting it at 1. That's fine.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess said R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 1, then if the secret word has R at position 1, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R is at position 1 is wrong, so it must be at 3,4, or 5.

 Similarly, A was at position 3 and now we put it at position 2.

 Let me consider ""RATIO"". But note: we are also testing I and O.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RASPY"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, S at 3, P at 4, Y at 5.

 But we don't know about S, P, Y.

 Another common word: ""RADIO"" -> but that has D and I and O. Also, A is at position 2 and R at 1.

 But we are avoiding C, N, E, so that's okay.

 However, we have to be cautious: we don't want to reuse positions for R and A that we already know are wrong? Actually, we are forced to put R in a new position (because we can't put it at position 2). Similarly, A must be in a new position (not 3).

 In ""RADIO"": 
   R is at position 1 (new) and A is at position 2 (new). So that's good.

 But we are also testing D, I, O.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RAPID"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, P at 3, I at 4, D at 5.

 Again, we are testing new letters.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters (C, N, E). ""RAPID"" doesn't have any of these.

 However, we have a problem: we know that the secret word has R and A, but we don't know if they are in the positions we are about to try. We are trying R at 1 and A at 2. If the secret word has R at 1, then we get a ✓ for R. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R must be at 3,4, or 5. Similarly for A.

 But we are also testing P, I, D.

 Another word: ""TRAIL"" -> T at 1, R at 2? Wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we already know that position 2 is not R. So we must avoid putting R at position 2.

 In ""TRAIL"", R is at position 2 -> that's the same as the first guess? And we know it's not at position 2. So we would get a '-' for R again? But we already know that. So that doesn't give new information about R's position? Actually, we would get a '-' again for R at position 2, but we already know that. So we should avoid that.

 Therefore, we want to avoid putting R at position 2 and A at position 3.

 So ""TRAIL"" is not good because R is at position 2.

 How about ""BRAVE""? But we have E? No, we cannot use E. So avoid.

 How about ""BRAID""? 
   B, R, A, I, D -> R is at position 2? Again, we must avoid position 2 for R.

 So we need a word that has R and A, and puts R in a position other than 2, and A in a position other than 3.

 Let me try to put R at position 1 and A at position 4? For example, ""ROTAL"" (which is not a word) or ""RADIO"" (as before) or ""RAPID"" (as before).

 ""RADIO"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, D at 3, I at 4, O at 5.

 This avoids putting R at position 2 and A at position 3.

 Similarly, ""RAPID"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, P at 3, I at 4, D at 5.

 Both are valid words.

 But which one is better? We want to test more common letters.

 Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

 ""RADIO"" uses D, I, O.
 ""RAPID"" uses P, I, D.

 S and T are very common. So maybe we should include S and T.

 How about ""RASPY"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, S at 3, P at 4, Y at 5.

 This has S and P.

 But we don't know if the word has S or P.

 Another word: ""RASIS"" -> but that has two S's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed.

 I think ""RASPY"" is acceptable, but Y is less common.

 How about ""RATIO"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, T at 3, I at 4, O at 5.

 This has T and I and O.

 But note: we have to avoid E, which we are.

 However, we have two vowels (A and I, O) and two consonants (R, T). We already know R and A are in the word, so we are testing T, I, O.

 But we don't know if T, I, O are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has S and T.

 How about ""RASTS""? -> duplicate S? and we don't know if duplicates exist.

 I think ""RATIO"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and we can get good information.

 But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates yet.

 Another word: ""ROAST"" is not good because A is at position 3 (which we know is wrong for A).

 How about ""ROAST"" is R at 1, O at 2, A at 3 (which we know is wrong) -> so we would get a '-' for A? But we already know A is not at position 3. So we don't learn anything new? Actually, we would learn that A is not at position 3 (if we get a '-') but we already know that. So it's a waste of a position.

 Therefore, we avoid putting A at position 3 and R at position 2.

 So let's choose between ""RADIO"", ""RAPID"", ""RATIO"", ""RASPY"", etc.

 I think ""RATIO"" is a good choice because it uses T, I, O which are common.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters (C, N, E). ""RATIO"" doesn't have any of these.

 So I'll go with ""RATIO"".

 However, let me check: 
   R at position 1: if the secret word has R at position 1, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know R must be at 3,4, or 5.
   A at position 2: similarly, if the secret word has A at position 2, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know A must be at 1,4, or 5.

 But note: we are also testing T at 3, I at 4, O at 5.

 Alternatively, we can try ""STAIR"": 
   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3? Wait, we cannot put A at position 3 because we already know that position 3 is not A. So we must avoid that.

 How about ""STAIR"" is invalid because A is at position 3.

 How about ""STRAY"": 
   S, T, R, A, Y -> R is at position 3? (because S at 1, T at 2, R at 3, A at 4, Y at 5). 
   This avoids position 2 for R (we are putting R at 3) and A at position 4 (which is new, because previously A was at 3).

 So ""STRAY"" has:
   S (new), T (new), R (at position 3, which is new), A (at position 4, new), Y (new).

 This seems good.

 But we don't know if S, T, Y are in the word.

 Alternatively, ""STARK"": 
   S, T, A, R, K -> A at position 3? We cannot put A at position 3. So invalid.

 How about ""START"": 
   S, T, A, R, T -> but duplicate T? And A is at position 3? We cannot put A at position 3.

 So ""START"" is invalid.

 How about ""PARTY"": 
   P, A, R, T, Y -> A at position 2 (new), R at position 3 (new, because previously R was at 2). So that's good.

 But we have to avoid E? Yes.

 However, we have two good candidates: ""RATIO"", ""RAPID"", ""STRAY"", ""RASPY"".

 I think ""STRAY"" is a good choice because it uses S and T, which are very common, and we avoid putting R at position 2 and A at position 3.

 But note: in ""STRAY"", we have R at position 3 and A at position 4. This is acceptable.

 Alternatively, ""RAPID"" has R at 1, A at 2, P at 3, I at 4, D at 5.

 Which one is better? 

 We want to test as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know E and N are out. So T, O, I, S are good.

 ""RATIO"" has T, I, O.
 ""RAPID"" has P, I, D.
 ""STRAY"" has S, T, Y.

 ""RATIO"" and ""STRAY"" have T and S.

 But ""RATIO"" has the advantage of having two vowels (I and O) which might be useful.

 However, we already know that the word has at least one vowel? Actually, we don't know about duplicates. But we know the word has at least one vowel (A) so far.

 I think ""RATIO"" is a good choice.

 But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have the letter R at position 1? We don't know. So let's test that.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RAISE"" but E is not allowed.

 How about ""RAILS"": 
   R at 1, A at 2, I at 3, L at 4, S at 5.

 This avoids the known bad positions: R is not at 2 (we are putting it at 1) and A is not at 3 (we are putting it at 2). So that's good.

 But we are testing L and S.

 I think ""RAILS"" is a valid word and uses common letters.

 However, we have to decide.

 Let me choose ""RATIO"" because it tests T, I, O.

 So my next guess: ""RATIO""

 But note: we are not forced to use R and A in the next guess? Actually, we are: because we know they are in the word? No, we are not required to use them, but if we don't, we might miss the chance to get more information about their positions.

 However, we can choose not to use R and A? But that might be inefficient because we already know they are in the word. We want to test new positions for R and A.

 So I think we should include R and A.

 Therefore, I choose ""RATIO"".

<guess>ratio</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").
- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **R** and **A** (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing **R** at position 2 or **A** at position 3.
- Must **avoid C, N, E** entirely.
- Should test new common letters (e.g., **T, I, O**) to gather more information.

The word **""RATIO""** fits these criteria:
- Places **R** at position 1 (new position, not tested before).
- Places **A** at position 2 (new position, since it was at position 3 in ""crane"").
- Introduces **T, I, O** (untested letters).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, N, E) and duplicates.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and A while testing three new letters.

Actually, we can use any letter except C, N, E.\n\n However, note that ""crane"" had R in position 2 and A in position 3. So in ""roast"":\n  R in position 1 -> if the secret word has R in position 1, then it would be correct. But we don\'t know that.\n  O is new, A in position 2? But wait, A was in position 3 in the first guess and now we are putting A in position 2. That might be okay.\n\n But let\'s check the letters: R, O, A, S, T.\n\n We know R and A are in the word, so that\'s good.\n\n We are avoiding C, N, E.\n\n However, we must consider that the feedback for R and A might be in the same positions as before? But we are changing the positions.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that puts R and A in positions that are not the ones we already tried.\n\n Another idea: we can try to use a word that has R and A and also includes other common letters to test.\n\n Let me list some words that have R and A, and avoid C, N, E.\n\n Possible words: \n   ""PARTY"" -> but we don\'t know if P, T, Y are in the word? And note: we have to avoid C, N, E.\n   ""RADAR"" -> but that has two R\'s and two A\'s? We don\'t know if the word has duplicates.\n\n But we don\'t have any information about duplicates yet.\n\n However, we want to maximize new information.

Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us if there are duplicates. For example, if the word had two R\'s, then if we guess one R in the wrong position and one in the right, we would see two \'-\' for R? But in our case, we only have one R in the guess and it was marked as present but wrong position. So there is at least one R. But there could be more.\n\n Similarly for A.\n\n However, to keep it simple, let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Let me try to form a word without C, N, E, and with R and A in positions that are not 2 and 3 respectively.\n\n We can try:\n   Position 1: R? -> but then we have R at position 1. But we don\'t know if that\'s correct. We can try R at position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n Similarly, A can be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n I think a good next guess would be ""ROAST"" or ""TRAIL"", but let me think of one.\n\n Another idea: ""RAISE"" -> but E is not allowed? We cannot use E because we know it\'s not in the word. So avoid E.\n\n How about ""RAILS""? But that has S at the end. But note: we don\'t know about S.\n\n Alternatively, ""PARTS"" -> but we have to avoid E? Actually, we can use any letter except C, N, E.\n\n But wait: we have to avoid C, N, E. So ""PARTS"" is okay? But ""PARTS"" has P, A, R, T, S.\n\n However, we are not sure about P, T, S.\n\n Let me think of a word that uses more common letters.\n\n How about ""STARK""? \n   S, T, A, R, K.\n\n But note: we have to avoid E? Yes, and we are avoiding C, N, E.\n\n However, we are not sure about S, T, K.\n\n Another common word: ""STAMP"" -> but we have to avoid E? Yes, and it doesn\'t have E. But it has M and P.\n\n But we don\'t know about M and P.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""ROAST"" (R at 1, O at 2, A at 3, S at 4, T at 5). But wait, in the first guess, A was at position 3 and we got a \'-\' meaning A is in the word but not at position 3. So if we put A at position 3 again, we would get the same feedback? Actually, we know A is not at position 3, so we should avoid putting A at position 3.\n\n So in ""ROAST"", A is at position 3 again. That would be a waste because we already know A is not at position 3.\n\n Therefore, we should avoid putting A at position 3 and R at position 2.\n\n So ""ROAST"" is not good because A is at position 3.\n\n How about ""ROARS""? But that has two R\'s and two A\'s? We don\'t want to duplicate if we can avoid it.\n\n Another word: ""PARTY"" -> P, A, R, T, Y.\n   A is at position 2 (which is new) and R is at position 3 (which is new for R, because previously it was at 2). So that\'s good.\n\n But we don\'t know about P, T, Y.\n\n Alternatively, ""RATIO"" -> but that has O and I, and T. But note: we have to avoid E? Yes. However, we have R at position 1, A at position 2, T at 3, I at 4, O at 5.\n\n But we know that R is in the word, so putting R at position 1 is a new position. Similarly, A at position 2 is new.\n\n However, we also know that R is not at position 2 (from the first guess) but we are putting it at 1. That\'s fine.\n\n But wait: the feedback for the first guess said R is in the word but not at position 2. So if we put R at position 1, then if the secret word has R at position 1, we get a ✓. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know R is at position 1 is wrong, so it must be at 3,4, or 5.\n\n Similarly, A was at position 3 and now we put it at position 2.\n\n Let me consider ""RATIO"". But note: we are also testing I and O.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RASPY"": \n   R at 1, A at 2, S at 3, P at 4, Y at 5.\n\n But we don\'t know about S, P, Y.\n\n Another common word: ""RADIO"" -> but that has D and I and O. Also, A is at position 2 and R at 1.\n\n But we are avoiding C, N, E, so that\'s okay.\n\n However, we have to be cautious: we don\'t want to reuse positions for R and A that we already know are wrong? Actually, we are forced to put R in a new position (because we can\'t put it at position 2). Similarly, A must be in a new position (not 3).\n\n In ""RADIO"": \n   R is at position 1 (new) and A is at position 2 (new). So that\'s good.\n\n But we are also testing D, I, O.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RAPID"": \n   R at 1, A at 2, P at 3, I at 4, D at 5.\n\n Again, we are testing new letters.\n\n But note: we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the excluded letters (C, N, E). ""RAPID"" doesn\'t have any of these.\n\n However, we have a problem: we know that the secret word has R and A, but we don\'t know if they are in the positions we are about to try. We are trying R at 1 and A at 2. If the secret word has R at 1, then we get a ✓ for R. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know R must be at 3,4, or 5. Similarly for A.\n\n But we are also testing P, I, D.\n\n Another word: ""TRAIL"" -> T at 1, R at 2? Wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we already know that position 2 is not R. So we must avoid putting R at position 2.\n\n In ""TRAIL"", R is at position 2 -> that\'s the same as the first guess? And we know it\'s not at position 2. So we would get a \'-\' for R again? But we already know that. So that doesn\'t give new information about R\'s position? Actually, we would get a \'-\' again for R at position 2, but we already know that. So we should avoid that.\n\n Therefore, we want to avoid putting R at position 2 and A at position 3.\n\n So ""TRAIL"" is not good because R is at position 2.\n\n How about ""BRAVE""? But we have E? No, we cannot use E. So avoid.\n\n How about ""BRAID""? \n   B, R, A, I, D -> R is at position 2? Again, we must avoid position 2 for R.\n\n So we need a word that has R and A, and puts R in a position other than 2, and A in a position other than 3.\n\n Let me try to put R at position 1 and A at position 4? For example, ""ROTAL"" (which is not a word) or ""RADIO"" (as before) or ""RAPID"" (as before).\n\n ""RADIO"": \n   R at 1, A at 2, D at 3, I at 4, O at 5.\n\n This avoids putting R at position 2 and A at position 3.\n\n Similarly, ""RAPID"": \n   R at 1, A at 2, P at 3, I at 4, D at 5.\n\n Both are valid words.\n\n But which one is better? We want to test more common letters.\n\n Common letters: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.\n\n ""RADIO"" uses D, I, O.\n ""RAPID"" uses P, I, D.\n\n S and T are very common. So maybe we should include S and T.\n\n How about ""RASPY"": \n   R at 1, A at 2, S at 3, P at 4, Y at 5.\n\n This has S and P.\n\n But we don\'t know if the word has S or P.\n\n Another word: ""RASIS"" -> but that has two S\'s? And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed.\n\n I think ""RASPY"" is acceptable, but Y is less common.\n\n How about ""RATIO"": \n   R at 1, A at 2, T at 3, I at 4, O at 5.\n\n This has T and I and O.\n\n But note: we have to avoid E, which we are.\n\n However, we have two vowels (A and I, O) and two consonants (R, T). We already know R and A are in the word, so we are testing T, I, O.\n\n But we don\'t know if T, I, O are in the word.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has S and T.\n\n How about ""RASTS""? -> duplicate S? and we don\'t know if duplicates exist.\n\n I think ""RATIO"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and we can get good information.\n\n But wait: we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t have any indication of duplicates yet.\n\n Another word: ""ROAST"" is not good because A is at position 3 (which we know is wrong for A).\n\n How about ""ROAST"" is R at 1, O at 2, A at 3 (which we know is wrong) -> so we would get a \'-\' for A? But we already know A is not at position 3. So we don\'t learn anything new? Actually, we would learn that A is not at position 3 (if we get a \'-\') but we already know that. So it\'s a waste of a position.\n\n Therefore, we avoid putting A at position 3 and R at position 2.\n\n So let\'s choose between ""RADIO"", ""RAPID"", ""RATIO"", ""RASPY"", etc.\n\n I think ""RATIO"" is a good choice because it uses T, I, O which are common.\n\n But note: we have to make sure we don\'t use any of the excluded letters (C, N, E). ""RATIO"" doesn\'t have any of these.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""RATIO"".\n\n However, let me check: \n   R at position 1: if the secret word has R at position 1, we get a ✓. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know R must be at 3,4, or 5.\n   A at position 2: similarly, if the secret word has A at position 2, we get a ✓. If not, we get a \'-\' and then we know A must be at 1,4, or 5.\n\n But note: we are also testing T at 3, I at 4, O at 5.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""STAIR"": \n   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3? Wait, we cannot put A at position 3 because we already know that position 3 is not A. So we must avoid that.\n\n How about ""STAIR"" is invalid because A is at position 3.\n\n How about ""STRAY"": \n   S, T, R, A, Y -> R is at position 3? (because S at 1, T at 2, R at 3, A at 4, Y at 5). \n   This avoids position 2 for R (we are putting R at 3) and A at position 4 (which is new, because previously A was at 3).\n\n So ""STRAY"" has:\n   S (new), T (new), R (at position 3, which is new), A (at position 4, new), Y (new).\n\n This seems good.\n\n But we don\'t know if S, T, Y are in the word.\n\n Alternatively, ""STARK"": \n   S, T, A, R, K -> A at position 3?

So that\'s good.\n\n But we have to avoid E? Yes.\n\n However, we have two good candidates: ""RATIO"", ""RAPID"", ""STRAY"", ""RASPY"".\n\n I think ""STRAY"" is a good choice because it uses S and T, which are very common, and we avoid putting R at position 2 and A at position 3.\n\n But note: in ""STRAY"", we have R at position 3 and A at position 4.

We want to test new positions for R and A.\n\n So I think we should include R and A.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""RATIO"".\n\n<guess>ratio</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C, N, E** are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **R** is in the word but **not in position 2** (marked ""-"").\n- **A** is in the word but **not in position 3** (marked ""-"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **R** and **A** (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing **R** at position 2 or **A** at position 3.\n- Must **avoid C, N, E** entirely.\n- Should test new common letters (e.g., **T, I, O**) to gather more information.\n\nThe word **""RATIO""** fits these criteria:\n- Places **R** at position 1 (new position, not tested before).\n- Places **A** at position 2 (new position, since it was at position 3 in ""crane"").\n- Introduces **T, I, O** (untested letters).\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, N, E) and duplicates.\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of R and A while testing three new letters.\n\n<guess>ratio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(-) I(x) O(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, wrong position)
  A: - (in word, wrong position)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""ratio""
  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word but not at position 1 (since we tried position 1 now) and not at position 2 (from first guess)
  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word but not at position 2 (tried now) and not at position 3 (from first guess)
  T: - (in word, wrong position) -> so T is in the word but not at position 3
  I: x (not in word)
  O: - (in word, wrong position) -> so O is in the word but not at position 5

So now we know:

Letters in the word: R, A, T, O (and we already knew R and A from the first guess, and now we know T and O are also in the word, but not in the positions we've tried)

Letters not in the word: C, N, E, I (and from the first guess: C, N, E; from second guess: I)

We also know the positions that are incorrect for each letter:

For R:
  - Position 1 (tried in ""ratio"") is incorrect -> so R must be in position 3, 4, or 5? Actually, from the first guess we knew R is not at position 2. Now we also know it's not at position 1. So R must be at position 3, 4, or 5.

For A:
  - Position 2 (tried in ""ratio"") is incorrect -> so A must be in position 1, 4, or 5? But wait, in the first guess we knew A is not at position 3. Now we also know it's not at position 2. So A must be at position 1, 4, or 5.

For T:
  - Position 3 (tried in ""ratio"") is incorrect -> so T must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? But note: we have the constraint that R is at 3,4,5 and A is at 1,4,5. But T can be at any position except 3.

For O:
  - Position 5 (tried in ""ratio"") is incorrect -> so O must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4? But we have to avoid positions that are already known to be incorrect for each letter.

We also know that the word has exactly these letters? No, we don't know if there are duplicates. But we have five distinct letters so far? Actually, we don't know. But we have R, A, T, O, and one more letter? Because the word is five letters and we have four letters so far? So the fifth letter must be one we haven't guessed yet.

We have guessed: C, R, A, N, E, I, O, T. That's five letters. But the secret word has five distinct letters? Not necessarily. We don't have evidence of duplicates.

But we know the word has R, A, T, O, and one more letter. That letter must be in one of the positions that we haven't filled.

So the secret word is: 
  Position 1: cannot be R (because R is not at 1), and we haven't tried T, O, or the new letter. But note: T, O, and the new letter are in the word, but we don't know which one is at position 1.
  Position 2: cannot be A (because A is not at 2) and cannot be T? Actually, we don't know. But we haven't tried T at position 2? We tried T at position 3 (in ""ratio"") and it was wrong. But we haven't tried T at position 2. Similarly, we haven't tried O at position 2? Only A at position 2 in the second guess was wrong.

But we know the word has T and O, so they must be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5? But with constraints:

- R: must be at 3,4,5
- A: must be at 1,4,5
- T: must be at 1,2,4,5 (but not 3)
- O: must be at 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

And the fifth letter: we don't know, but it must be one of the remaining letters that haven't been excluded.

Excluded letters: C, E, I, N. So the fifth letter must be from the remaining alphabet.

We also know that the word has exactly five distinct letters? Not necessarily. We have five distinct letters in our guesses, but the secret word might have duplicates? We don't have any duplicate feedback so far. So let's assume no duplicates for now.

But we must consider the possibility.

Now, we need to form a word that satisfies these constraints.

We can list possible positions for each letter:

R: positions 3,4,5
A: positions 1,4,5
T: positions 1,2,4,5
O: positions 1,2,3,4

And the fifth letter: positions 1,2,3,4,5 (but we have to assign one letter to each position).

We also know that the secret word has T and O, so they must be in the positions that are allowed.

But note: we have two letters that must be placed: R and A, and T and O, and one more letter.

We can try to think of words that fit.

First, note that R and A cannot be at the same position? They are two different letters.

Similarly, T and O are different.

Now, we have to assign positions without conflict.

Let me try to see possible placements.

We know position 1 cannot be R (because R is not at 1) and cannot be A? Actually, A can be at position 1. But we don't know.

Similarly, position 2: cannot be A (from second guess) and cannot be T? We don't know. T can be at position 2.

But we also have to place T and O.

Let me try to form a word.

We can try putting A at position 1.

Then:
  A at 1.
  Then R must be at 3,4, or 5.
  T must be at 2,4, or 5 (but not 3, and position 1 is taken by A).

But if we put A at 1, then position 2: we can try T? But T can be at position 2.

But we also have O to place. O can be at position 2? But if we put T at position 2, then O must be at position 3 or 4? But position 3: we can put O? But then we have to place the fifth letter.

Alternatively, we can try putting R at position 3.

But let's think of actual words.

We need a word that has:
  A at 1? Or other positions.

But we don't know. We can try a word that uses as many new letters as possible to test.

We know the word has R, A, T, O, and one more letter. Let's call that letter X.

We can try to form a word with A at position 1, R at position 4 or 5, T at position 2 or 4 or 5, and O at position 2,3,4? But we have to assign without conflict.

For example:
  A at 1, then position 2: we can try T? But T can be at 2. Then position 3: we can try O? But then we have to put X at 5? But we don't know X.

But we can try ""A...T...O..."" but we need a real word.

How about ""ALOFT""? 
  A at 1, L (new) at 2, O at 3, F (new) at 4, T at 5.
  But check constraints:
    R: we haven't placed at 3,4,5? We placed at 1 in the second guess and got '-', so R is not at 1. Now we are putting R at 3? But we haven't tried R at 3. Actually, in the first guess R was at 2, in the second R was at 1, so position 3 is untested for R.

But in ""ALOFT"", R is at position 3. Is that allowed? Yes, because R can be at 3,4,5.

But we also have to check for A: we are putting A at 1. Is that allowed? Yes, because A can be at 1,4,5.

But we haven't tested A at 1? Actually, we haven't tested A at 1,4,5. We tested A at 3 (in first guess) and at 2 (in second guess) and both were wrong. So A can be at 1,4,5.

Similarly, R: we haven't tested at 3,4,5. We tested at 2 (in first guess) and at 1 (in second guess) and both were wrong. So R can be at 3,4,5.

T: we haven't tested at 1,2,4,5? We tested T at 3 (in second guess) and it was wrong. So T can be at 1,2,4,5.

O: we haven't tested at 1,2,3,4? We tested at 5 (in second guess) and it was wrong. So O can be at 1,2,3,4.

Now, in ""ALOFT"":
  Position 1: A -> we are testing A at 1. If the secret word has A at 1, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know A is at 4 or 5.
  Position 2: L -> new letter, we don't know if it's in the word.
  Position 3: O -> we are testing O at 3. If correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know O is not at 3.
  Position 4: F -> new letter.
  Position 5: T -> we are testing T at 5. If correct, ✓. If not, then T must be at 1,2, or 4.

But we have a problem: we are testing A at 1 and O at 3. But what if the secret word has A at 1 and O at 3? Then we would get a ✓ for A and a ✓ for O? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put A at 1? Because we are not sure.

Another idea: we can try to put R at position 4 or 5.

For example, how about ""AUDIO""? But we have U and D, but we don't know about U and D. Also, we have to avoid I? We know I is not in the word. But ""AUDIO"" has I? No, ""AUDIO"" has A, U, D, I, O. But I is excluded. So we cannot use I.

How about ""ABOUT""? But we have B, O, U, T. But we don't know about B and U. Also, in ""ABOUT"": 
  A at 1, B at 2, O at 3, U at 4, T at 5.
  But we are testing A at 1, O at 3, T at 5. But we also have B and U.

But we don't know about B and U.

Alternatively, we can try ""RADIO"" but we already tried that? No, we haven't tried it in the context of the secret word.

But in the second guess we tried ""ratio"", not ""radio"". We haven't tried ""radio"".

But ""radio"" has R at 1, A at 2, D at 3, I at 4, O at 5. But we know I is not in the word (from second guess: I is x). So we cannot use ""radio"" because it has I.

How about ""DAIRY""? But we have I? No, ""DAIRY"" has I? D, A, I, R, Y -> I is excluded. So no.

Another word: ""PARTY""
  P, A, R, T, Y.
  A at 2? But we know A is not at position 2 (from second guess: A at 2 was marked as wrong position). So we cannot put A at 2.

How about ""PATIO""? But that has I? No, ""PATIO"" has I? P, A, T, I, O -> I is excluded.

We need a word without I.

How about ""ROBOT""? But that has O twice? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to avoid E, C, N.

""ROBOT"" has R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, O at 4, T at 5. But we have two O's. We don't know if the secret word has two O's. But we haven't seen any duplicate feedback. So it's possible? But we are avoiding duplicates for now? Actually, we don't know.

But we have to avoid I, so let's skip.

Another word: ""RALLY""? 
  R at 1, A at 2, L at 3, L at 4, Y at 5. But we cannot put A at 2 (we know it's not at 2). So invalid.

How about ""RALLY"" is invalid because of A at 2.

How about ""TAROT""? 
  T at 1, A at 2, R at 3, O at 4, T at 5 -> duplicate T? and A at 2 is invalid.

We need a word without A at 2.

How about ""OCTAL""? But we have C? We know C is not in the word (from first guess: C is x). So we cannot use C.

We must avoid C, E, I, N.

So the word must not contain C, E, I, N.

Let me think of words that fit the constraints.

We can try:

Option 1: A at position 1.
  Then the word: A _ _ _ _
  R must be at 3,4,5.
  T must be at 2,4,5 (but not 3).
  O must be at 2,3,4 (but not 5).

But position 2: we can try T? Yes, because T can be at 2.

So: A, T, R, O, and then the fifth letter.

But what positions?
  A at 1, T at 2, R at 3? Then we have positions 4 and 5 for O and the fifth letter? But O must be at 3? We are putting O at 3? But we don't know if O can be at 3.

But we haven't tested O at 3. So it's possible.

But we have to assign: 
  Position 1: A
  Position 2: T
  Position 3: R -> but R at 3? We haven't tested R at 3. So it's possible.

But then we have O and the fifth letter left. But we have to put O in a position that is not 5? So positions 3 or 4? But position 3 is taken by R? So O must be at 4? Then position 5 must be the fifth letter.

So: A, T, R, O, ?

But we have to form a word. What word? ""ATRO"" ... ""ATRO"" is not a word. 

How about ""AORTY""? Not a word.

Another option: put A at 4.

Then:
  Positions: 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: A, 5: ?

Then R must be at 3,4,5? But position 4 is taken by A, so R at 3 or 5.

T must be at 1,2,5? But if R is at 5, then T can be at 1 or 2.

O must be at 1,2,3? But position 3: if we put O at 3, then we have:
  Position 1: ?
  Position 2: ?
  Position 3: O
  Position 4: A
  Position 5: R? But then T must be at 1 or 2.

But we have to assign the fifth letter? Actually, we have four positions: 1,2,3,5 and we have three letters: T, O, R? But we have five positions and four letters? So one of the positions must be the fifth letter.

But we have to put T, O, R, and the fifth letter. And we have positions 1,2,3,5 for them.

But we know T cannot be at 3? So T must be at 1 or 2.

O must not be at 5? So O can be at 3? Then position 5 must be the fifth letter.

So: 
  Position 1: T or the fifth letter?
  Position 2: T or the fifth letter? But we have to assign.

But we don't know the fifth letter. We know it must be a letter that is not C, E, I, N.

Let me try to find words that start with T? Or end with T?

How about ""TOTem""? But that has E? E is excluded.

How about ""TOWER""? But E is excluded.

How about ""TAROT""? But A is at 2? We know A is not at 2. So invalid.

How about ""TARGO""? Not a word.

Another idea: put R at position 4.

Then:
  Positions: 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: R, 5: ?

Then A must be at 1,4,5? But position 4 is taken by R, so A at 1 or 5.

T must be at 1,2,5? But if A is at 1, then T can be at 2 or 5? And O must be at 1,2,3? But position 1 is taken, so O at 2 or 3.

So if A is at 1, then:
  Position 1: A
  Position 2: O? Or T? Or the fifth letter?
  Position 3: O? Or the fifth letter? But we have to assign.

But we know T must be in the word? So T must be at 2 or 5.

If we put T at 2, then O can be at 3? Then position 5: fifth letter.

Word: A, T, O, R, ?

But ""ATOR"" is not a word. ""ATORM""? But M? And we don't know about M. ""ATORM"" is not a word.

How about ""AORTY""? Not a word.

Alternatively, if we put A at 5.

Then:
  Positions: 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: R, 5: A

Then T must be at 1,2,4? But position 4 is R, so T at 1 or 2.

O must be at 1,2,3? But if T is at 1, then O can be at 2 or 3? And the fifth letter at the remaining.

But we have to avoid I? So positions 1,2,3,4,5: 
  Position 1: T or the fifth letter?
  Position 2: T or the fifth letter? But we have to assign.

Example: T at 1, then O at 2, then position 3: the fifth letter, position 4: R, position 5: A.

Word: T, O, ?, R, A -> ""TO?RA""? 

What word? ""TORAH""? But H? And ""TORAH"" is a word? It's a musical instrument. But let's check: T at 1, O at 2, R at 3? But R at 3? We haven't tested R at 3. And A at 5? We haven't tested A at 5.

But we also have to avoid I? Yes.

""TORAH"": T, O, R, A, H. 
  Positions: 
    1: T -> we are testing T at 1. If T is at 1, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know T is at 2,4, or 5? But we have A at 5 and R at 3.

But we haven't tested H.

But we are testing T at 1? And if T is at 1, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know T is at 2,4, or 5.

Similarly, O at 2: we haven't tested O at 2? In the second guess, O was at 5 and got '-', so O is not at 5. But we haven't tested O at 2.

So ""TORAH"" is a candidate.

But is ""TORAH"" a valid word? Yes.

But we have to consider: if we use ""TORAH"", then:
  Position 1: T -> if T is at 1, we get ✓. If not, we get '-' and then we know T is at 2,4,5.
  Position 2: O -> if O is at 2, we get ✓. If not, we get '-' and then we know O is not at 2? But we haven't tested O at 2.

But we also have R at 3: if R is at 3, we get ✓. If not, we get '-' and then we know R is at 4 or 5.

Similarly, A at 5: if A is at 5, ✓. If not, we get '-' and then A must be at 1 or 4? But we are putting A at 5, so if it's not there, then A must be at 1 or 4.

But we are also testing H.

Alternatively, we can try ""ROTAL"" (which is not a word) or ""ROTAS"" (which is a word? rotas is not common). 

How about ""ROTAS"": 
  R at 1? But we know R is not at 1 (from second guess: R at 1 was marked as wrong position). So we cannot put R at 1.

How about ""STARE""? But E is excluded.

How about ""STARK""? 
  S, T, A, R, K -> but we have to avoid E? Yes.
  A at 3? But we know A is not at position 3 (from first guess). So invalid.

How about ""START""? 
  S, T, A, R, T -> duplicate T? And A at 3? Invalid.

How about ""PARTY"": 
  P, A, R, T, Y -> A at 2? We know A is not at 2. So invalid.

How about ""RALLY""? 
  R at 1? We know R is not at 1. So invalid.

We are having trouble finding a word that fits.

Another candidate: ""OAKUM""? But we have U and M, and we don't know about them. Also, O at 1, A at 2? A at 2 is invalid.

How about ""DOZEN""? But E and N are excluded.

We need to avoid E, C, N, I.

Let me try a different approach: put R at position 4.

Then:
  Positions: 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: R, 5: ?

Now, A must be at 1,4,5? But position 4 is R, so A at 1 or 5.

T must be at 1,2,5? But if A is at 1, then T can be at 2 or 5? And O must be at 1,2,3? But position 1 is taken, so O at 2 or 3.

So if A at 1, then:
  Position 1: A
  Position 2: O? -> then position 3: ? (must be the fifth letter? but we have to put T? Wait, T must be placed. But if we put O at 2, then T must be at 5? Because position 3 must be the fifth letter? But we have to put T somewhere.

But we have positions 1,2,3,5: 
  Position 1: A
  Position 2: O? 
  Position 3: must be T? Because we have to put T and it's the only position left? But we have T to place and the fifth letter. But we have three positions: 1,2,3,5 and we have two letters: T and the fifth? But we have three letters: R, A, T, O and the fifth? Actually, we have four positions: 1,2,3,5 and we have to place R, A, T, O and the fifth letter? But we have only four positions and five letters? So one position must be the fifth letter.

But we have to assign positions without conflict.

So if A is at 1, then:
  Position 1: A
  Position 2: O? -> then position 3: T? -> but T can be at 3? No, because we tried T at 3 in the second guess and it was marked as wrong position? So T cannot be at 3.

Therefore, if A is at 1, we cannot put T at 3. So T must be at 2 or 5.

But if we put T at 2, then position 3 must be the fifth letter? But we have to put O somewhere. O can be at 3? But then position 3 is O? Then position 5 is the fifth letter.

So: A, T, O, R, ? -> but then position 4 must be the fifth letter? But we have R at 4? Actually, we are putting R at 4? But we haven't tested R at 4.

But we are putting A at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, and fifth letter at 5.

But we have to avoid E, C, N, I. And we did.

So ""ATORM""? Not a word.

How about ""AORTY""? Not a word.

Another word: ""AUDIO"" is invalid because of I.

How about ""MORTY""? But we have M, O, R, T, Y. 
  M at 1, O at 2, R at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.
  Check constraints:
    A: we are not including? But we know A is in the word. So we must include A.

We must include all the letters we know are in the word: R, A, T, O.

So the word must have R, A, T, O and one more.

So the fifth letter must be one that we haven't guessed and is not excluded.

We have excluded: C, E, I, N.

So the fifth letter can be: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test a common letter.

But we are having trouble forming a word.

Let me try to list possible words that have R, A, T, O and one more letter, avoiding C, E, I, N.

For example:
  ""ROTAL"" -> not a word.
  ""ROTAS"" -> not common? But ""ROTAS"" is a word? It means to rotate or vary rate? Not very common.
  ""ROTAN"" -> but N is excluded.

How about ""ROBOT""? But has O twice? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, B and T? But we have to avoid E, C, N, I. ""ROBOT"" has O twice? And we are avoiding duplicates? Actually, we don't know. But we can avoid.

How about ""ROAST""? But we have S and T? And A at 2? We know A is not at 2. So invalid.

How about ""RUSTY"": 
  R at 1? We know R is not at 1. So invalid.

How about ""RALLY"": invalid because of A at 2.

How about ""TAROT"": 
  T at 1, A at 2? A at 2 is invalid.

How about ""TARGO"": not a word.

How about ""TAROK"": not a word.

How about ""TAKEN"": but E and N are excluded.

Another idea: put A at position 4.

Then:
  Positions: 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: A, 5: ?

Now, R must be at 3,4,5? But position 4 is A, so R at 3 or 5.

T must be at 1,2,5? But if R is at 5, then T can be at 1 or 2.

O must be at 1,2,3? But if R is at 5, then O can be at 1,2,3.

So if we put:
  Position 1: T? Or the fifth letter?
  Position 2: T? Or the fifth letter? But we have to assign.

Example: T at 1, then position 2: the fifth letter? Then position 3: O? Then position 4: A, position 5: R.

Word: T, ?, O, A, R -> ""T?OAR""? 

What words? ""TOWER"" has E? Excluded.

"" TUMOR""? But U and M? And ""TUMOR"" has U and M, but no A? We need A at 4.

How about ""TAROT"": invalid because of A at 2.

How about ""TAROK"": not a word.

How about ""TALON""? But N is excluded.

How about ""TALOR""? Not a word.

How about ""TAMOR""? Not a word.

How about ""TABOR""? Not a word.

How about ""TAJOR""? No.

Another word: ""MANOR""? But M, A, N, O, R -> but N is excluded.

How about ""FJORD""? But we have F, J, O, R, D. But we don't know about F, J, D. Also, we are missing A? We must include A.

We must include A, R, T, O.

So the word must have A, R, T, O and one more.

How about ""AORTY""? Not a word.

How about ""AORTAL""? Too long.

We need 5 letters.

How about ""RADIO""? But we already tried ""ratio"" and we know I is not in the word. ""RADIO"" has I? No, ""RADIO"" has D, I, O? But I is excluded.

So we cannot use ""RADIO"".

How about ""RAPID"": 
  R at 1? We know R is not at 1. So invalid.

How about ""RALLY"": A at 2? Invalid.

How about ""TAROT"": A at 2? Invalid.

We are stuck.

Another candidate: ""ORATE""? But E is excluded.

How about ""OCTAD""? But C is excluded.

How about ""OAKUM"": 
  O at 1, A at 2? A at 2 is invalid.

How about ""OAPES"": but E and S? E is excluded.

How about ""OASIS"": has S and I? I is excluded.

How about ""OASIS"": has S and I? I is excluded.

How about ""OAVES"": E and S? E excluded.

How about ""OCEAN"": C and E excluded.

We need to avoid E, C, N, I.

Let me try a different arrangement: put R at position 5.

Then:
  Positions: 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: ?, 5: R

Now, A must be at 1,4,5? But position 5 is R, so A at 1 or 4.

T must be at 1,2,4? But if A is at 1, then T can be at 2 or 4.

O must be at 1,2,3,4? But if A is at 1, then O can be at 2 or 3 or 4.

So if A at 1, T at 2, then O at 3 or 4.

And position 4 or 5 must be the fifth letter.

So: 
  Position 1: A
  Position 2: T
  Position 3: O? Then position 4: fifth letter? But O can be at 3? Yes.
  Position 4: fifth letter? But we have to put O? Actually, we have to assign O to a position.

But if we put O at 3, then position 4: fifth letter, position 5: R.

Word: A, T, O, ?, R

What words? ""ATOLL"" -> but duplicate L? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, O is at 3? But we haven't tested O at 3.

But ""ATOLL"" has duplicate L? And we don't know if the secret word has duplicates.

But we are avoiding duplicates for now.

How about ""ATOMS"": 
  A at 1, T at 2, O at 3, M at 4, S at 5? 
  Check constraints:
    R: we are not including? But we must include R.

We must include R.

So we need R in the word.

How about ""AORTY""? Not a word.

How about ""AUDIO""? I excluded.

How about ""ABOUT"": 
  A at 1, B at 2, O at 3, U at 4, T at 5.
  Check:
    R: not in the word? But we know R is in the word. So we must have R.

We have R, A, T, O. ""ABOUT"" has A, B, O, U, T -> no R.

So invalid.

How about ""AORTY"" is not a word.

How about ""AERIE""? E excluded.

We are having trouble. Maybe we should consider that the fifth letter might be one that we haven't thought of.

Another candidate: ""ROTAS"": 
  R at 1? We know R is not at 1. So invalid.

How about ""ROTAL"": not a word.

How about ""ROTAS"": 
  R at 1 -> invalid.

How about ""TORAH"": 
  T at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, H at 5.
  Check:
    A at 4: we haven't tested A at 4? So it's possible.
    R at 3: we haven't tested R at 3? So it's possible.
    T at 1: we haven't tested T at 1? So it's possible.
    O at 2: we haven't tested O at 2? So it's possible.

And the fifth letter is H.

So ""TORAH"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning a musical instrument.

And it avoids C, E, I, N.

So let's use ""TORAH"".

But note: we are testing:
  T at 1: if correct, ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know T is at 2,4, or 5? But we have T at 1, so if it's not at 1, then T must be at 2,4, or 5.

Similarly, O at 2: if correct, ✓. If not, then O is not at 2? But we haven't tested O at 2 before? Actually, in the second guess, O was at 5, so we haven't tested O at 2.

R at 3: we haven't tested R at 3? So we are testing it.

A at 4: we haven't tested A at 4? So we are testing it.

H at 5: new letter.

So this is a valid guess.

But we have to make sure that we are not repeating the same mistake.

Alternatively, we can try ""HORDE"": but E is excluded.

How about ""HORDE"" is invalid.

Another word: ""HORNY""? But N is excluded.

How about ""HORDE"" is not allowed because of E.

How about ""GATOR""? Not a word.

How about ""VOTER""? E excluded.

How about ""BOTER""? E excluded.

How about ""ROTAL"" -> not a word.

How about ""ROTAS"": 
  R at 1 -> invalid.

How about ""TORAH"" is the best so far.

Another word: ""ROTAS"" is not common, but ""TORAH"" is acceptable.

But let me confirm: 
  T at 1: if the secret word has T at 1, we get ✓. If not, we get '-' and then we know T is at 2,4,5.
  O at 2: if O is at 2, we get ✓. If not, we get '-' and then we know O is not at 2? But we haven't tested O at 2 before? Actually, we haven't tested O at 2, so it's okay.

But we have to be cautious: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't have any indication, but we can avoid.

Alternatively, we can try ""TORUS"": 
  T at 1, O at 2, R at 3, U at 4, S at 5.
  But we are missing A? We must have A.

So invalid.

We must include A.

Another candidate: ""ABOUT"" is no good because no R.

How about ""AORTA"": duplicate A? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, A at 1 and 5? But we are putting A at 1 and 5? But we don't know if the word has duplicates.

But we have to avoid I? ""AORTA"" has A twice? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, it has I? No, ""AORTA"" has A, O, R, T, A -> duplicate A. And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Moreover, we have to avoid I? It doesn't have I, but it has A twice and we don't know.

But we are avoiding duplicates? Actually, we don't know. But we can avoid.

But ""AORTA"" is not a common word.

How about ""AORTY""? Not a word.

How about ""AERIE""? E excluded.

I think ""TORAH"" is a valid and common word.

So I'll go with ""TORAH"".

But let me see if there is a word with S or L.

How about ""TORUS"" without A? No.

How about ""TAROT"" without A? No.

How about ""TALON"" without R? No.

We must have R.

Another word: ""TORAH"" is one.

But what about ""ROTAN""? N excluded.

How about ""ROTAS"": 
  R at 1 -> invalid.

How about ""TORAL""? Not a word.

How about ""TORAM""? Not a word.

How about ""TORAH"" is the best.

But note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating the same positions for R and A that we already know are wrong.

In ""TORAH"":
  T at 1: we haven't tried T at 1? So we are testing it.
  O at 2: we haven't tried O at 2? So we are testing it.
  R at 3: we haven't tried R at 3? So we are testing it.
  A at 4: we haven't tried A at 4? So we are testing it.
  H at 5: new letter.

And we avoid C, E, I, N.

So I think ""TORAH"" is a good guess.

But let me think of another word: ""ROTAL"" is not a word.

How about ""ROTAS"": 
  R at 1 -> invalid.

How about ""TORAH"" is the only one I can think of.

Another one: ""ROTAN"" is not allowed because of N.

How about ""VOTER"": E excluded.

I think we should go with ""TORAH"".

But wait, what about ""TAROT""? We cannot because A is at 2.

How about ""TABOR""? Not a word.

So I choose ""TORAH"".

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have the letter at a position we haven't tried.

But we have to test.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a different fifth letter.

For example, ""ROTAL"" is not a word.

How about ""ROTAS"": 
  R at 1 -> invalid.

How about ""TORAH"" is the word.

But let me search for other words.

Another word: ""ROTAL"" is not a word.

How about ""ROTAS"": 
  R at 1 -> invalid.

How about ""TORAH"" is the only common word I can think of.

So I'll go with ""TORAH"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not putting a letter in a position that we already know is wrong for that letter? We haven't tested any of these positions for each letter.

So let's guess ""TORAH"".

But wait, what about the fifth letter? In ""TORAH"", the fifth letter is H. We haven't tested H.

But we are testing it.

Alternatively, we can try ""ABOUT"" but without R.

We must include R.

Another candidate: ""TORAL"" is not a word.

How about ""TORAM""? Not a word.

I think ""TORAH"" is acceptable.

So I'll guess ""TORAH"".

But let me write it: T at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, H at 5.

But wait, we are putting O at 2 and A at 4. We haven't tested O at 2 and A at 4? So we are testing them.

And R at 3: we haven't tested R at 3.

So that's good.

Therefore, the next guess is ""TORAH"".

But note: we have to be cautious. What if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't have any indication, but we are avoiding duplicates in this guess.

So I'll go with ""TORAH"".

<guess>torah</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Excluded letters**: C, E, I, N (from ""crane"" and ""ratio"" feedback).
- **Included letters**: R, A, T, O (confirmed present in the word).
- **Position constraints**:
  - R cannot be at position 1 (tested in ""ratio"") or 2 (tested in ""crane""), so R must be at 3, 4, or 5.
  - A cannot be at position 2 (tested in ""ratio"") or 3 (tested in ""crane""), so A must be at 1, 4, or 5.
  - T cannot be at position 3 (tested in ""ratio""), so T must be at 1, 2, 4, or 5.
  - O cannot be at position 5 (tested in ""ratio""), so O must be at 1, 2, 3, or 4.

The word **""TORAH""** satisfies all constraints:
- **T** at position 1 (tests if T is at 1).
- **O** at position 2 (tests if O is at 2).
- **R** at position 3 (tests if R is at 3).
- **A** at position 4 (tests if A is at 4).
- **H** (new letter) at position 5.

This guess tests new positions for R, A, T, and O, while introducing H to check for the fifth missing letter.

<guess>torah</guess>",torah,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
  C: x (not in word)
  R: - (in word, wrong position)
  A: - (in word, wrong position)
  N: x (not in word)
  E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""ratio""
  R: - (in word, wrong position) -> so R is in the word but not at position 1 (since we tried position 1 now) and not at position 2 (from first guess)
  A: - (in word, wrong position) -> so A is in the word but not at position 2 (tried now) and not at position 3 (from first guess)
  T: - (in word, wrong position) -> so T is in the word but not at position 3
  I: x (not in word)
  O: - (in word, wrong position) -> so O is in the word but not at position 5

So now we know:

Letters in the word: R, A, T, O (and we already knew R and A from the first guess, and now we know T and O are also in the word, but not in the positions we've tried)

Letters not in the word: C, N, E, I (and from the first guess: C, N, E; from second guess: I)

We also know the positions that are incorrect for each letter:

For R:
  - Position 1 (tried in ""ratio"") is incorrect -> so R must be in position 3, 4, or 5? Actually, from the first guess we knew R is not at position 2. Now we also know it's not at position 1. So R must be at position 3, 4, or 5.

For A:
  - Position 2 (tried in ""ratio"") is incorrect -> so A must be in position 1, 4, or 5? But wait, in the first guess we knew A is not at position 3. Now we also know it's not at position 2. So A must be at position 1, 4, or 5.

For T:
  - Position 3 (tried in ""ratio"") is incorrect -> so T must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? But note: we have the constraint that R is at 3,4,5 and A is at 1,4,5. But T can be at any position except 3.

For O:
  - Position 5 (tried in ""ratio"") is incorrect -> so O must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4? But we have to avoid positions that are already known to be incorrect for each letter.

We also know that the word has exactly these letters? No, we don't know if there are duplicates. But we have five distinct letters so far? Actually, we don't know. But we have R, A, T, O, and one more letter? Because the word is five letters and we have four letters so far? So the fifth letter must be one we haven't guessed yet.

We have guessed: C, R, A, N, E, I, O, T. That's five letters. But the secret word has five distinct letters? Not necessarily. We don't have evidence of duplicates.

But we know the word has R, A, T, O, and one more letter. That letter must be in one of the positions that we haven't filled.

So the secret word is: 
  Position 1: cannot be R (because R is not at 1), and we haven't tried T, O, or the new letter. But note: T, O, and the new letter are in the word, but we don't know which one is at position 1.
  Position 2: cannot be A (because A is not at 2) and cannot be T? Actually, we don't know. But we haven't tried T at position 2? We tried T at position 3 (in ""ratio"") and it was wrong. But we haven't tried T at position 2. Similarly, we haven't tried O at position 2? Only A at position 2 in the second guess was wrong.

But we know the word has T and O, so they must be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5? But with constraints:

- R: must be at 3,4,5
- A: must be at 1,4,5
- T: must be at 1,2,4,5 (but not 3)
- O: must be at 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

And the fifth letter: we don't know, but it must be one of the remaining letters that haven't been excluded.

Excluded letters: C, E, I, N. So the fifth letter must be from the remaining alphabet.

We also know that the word has exactly five distinct letters? Not necessarily. We have five distinct letters in our guesses, but the secret word might have duplicates? We don't have any duplicate feedback so far. So let's assume no duplicates for now.

But we must consider the possibility.

Now, we need to form a word that satisfies these constraints.

We can list possible positions for each letter:

R: positions 3,4,5
A: positions 1,4,5
T: positions 1,2,4,5
O: positions 1,2,3,4

And the fifth letter: positions 1,2,3,4,5 (but we have to assign one letter to each position).

We also know that the secret word has T and O, so they must be in the positions that are allowed.

But note: we have two letters that must be placed: R and A, and T and O, and one more letter.

We can try to think of words that fit.

First, note that R and A cannot be at the same position? They are two different letters.

Similarly, T and O are different.

Now, we have to assign positions without conflict.

Let me try to see possible placements.

We know position 1 cannot be R (because R is not at 1) and cannot be A? Actually, A can be at position 1. But we don't know.

Similarly, position 2: cannot be A (from second guess) and cannot be T? We don't know. T can be at position 2.

But we also have to place T and O.

Let me try to form a word.

We can try putting A at position 1.

Then:
  A at 1.
  Then R must be at 3,4, or 5.
  T must be at 2,4, or 5 (but not 3, and position 1 is taken by A).

But if we put A at 1, then position 2: we can try T? But T can be at position 2.

But we also have O to place. O can be at position 2? But if we put T at position 2, then O must be at position 3 or 4? But position 3: we can put O? But then we have to place the fifth letter.

Alternatively, we can try putting R at position 3.

But let's think of actual words.

We need a word that has:
  A at 1? Or other positions.

But we don't know. We can try a word that uses as many new letters as possible to test.

We know the word has R, A, T, O, and one more letter. Let's call that letter X.

We can try to form a word with A at position 1, R at position 4 or 5, T at position 2 or 4 or 5, and O at position 2,3,4? But we have to assign without conflict.

For example:
  A at 1, then position 2: we can try T? But T can be at 2. Then position 3: we can try O? But then we have to put X at 5? But we don't know X.

But we can try ""A...T...O..."" but we need a real word.

How about ""ALOFT""? 
  A at 1, L (new) at 2, O at 3, F (new) at 4, T at 5.
  But check constraints:
    R: we haven't placed at 3,4,5? We placed at 1 in the second guess and got '-', so R is not at 1. Now we are putting R at 3? But we haven't tried R at 3. Actually, in the first guess R was at 2, in the second R was at 1, so position 3 is untested for R.

But in ""ALOFT"", R is at position 3. Is that allowed? Yes, because R can be at 3,4,5.

But we also have to check for A: we are putting A at 1. Is that allowed? Yes, because A can be at 1,4,5.

But we haven't tested A at 1? Actually, we haven't tested A at 1,4,5. We tested A at 3 (in first guess) and at 2 (in second guess) and both were wrong. So A can be at 1,4,5.

Similarly, R: we haven't tested at 3,4,5. We tested at 2 (in first guess) and at 1 (in second guess) and both were wrong. So R can be at 3,4,5.

T: we haven't tested at 1,2,4,5? We tested T at 3 (in second guess) and it was wrong. So T can be at 1,2,4,5.

O: we haven't tested at 1,2,3,4? We tested at 5 (in second guess) and it was wrong. So O can be at 1,2,3,4.

Now, in ""ALOFT"":
  Position 1: A -> we are testing A at 1. If the secret word has A at 1, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know A is at 4 or 5.
  Position 2: L -> new letter, we don't know if it's in the word.
  Position 3: O -> we are testing O at 3. If correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know O is not at 3.
  Position 4: F -> new letter.
  Position 5: T -> we are testing T at 5. If correct, ✓. If not, then T must be at 1,2, or 4.

But we have a problem: we are testing A at 1 and O at 3. But what if the secret word has A at 1 and O at 3? Then we would get a ✓ for A and a ✓ for O? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't put A at 1? Because we are not sure.

Another idea: we can try to put R at position 4 or 5.

For example, how about ""AUDIO""? But we have U and D, but we don't know about U and D. Also, we have to avoid I? We know I is not in the word. But ""AUDIO"" has I? No, ""AUDIO"" has A, U, D, I, O. But I is excluded. So we cannot use I.

How about ""ABOUT""? But we have B, O, U, T. But we don't know about B and U. Also, in ""ABOUT"": 
  A at 1, B at 2, O at 3, U at 4, T at 5.
  But we are testing A at 1, O at 3, T at 5. But we also have B and U.

But we don't know about B and U.

Alternatively, we can try ""RADIO"" but we already tried that? No, we haven't tried it in the context of the secret word.

But in the second guess we tried ""ratio"", not ""radio"". We haven't tried ""radio"".

But ""radio"" has R at 1, A at 2, D at 3, I at 4, O at 5. But we know I is not in the word (from second guess: I is x). So we cannot use ""radio"" because it has I.

How about ""DAIRY""? But we have I? No, ""DAIRY"" has I? D, A, I, R, Y -> I is excluded. So no.

Another word: ""PARTY""
  P, A, R, T, Y.
  A at 2? But we know A is not at position 2 (from second guess: A at 2 was marked as wrong position). So we cannot put A at 2.

How about ""PATIO""? But that has I? No, ""PATIO"" has I? P, A, T, I, O -> I is excluded.

We need a word without I.

How about ""ROBOT""? But that has O twice? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have to avoid E, C, N.

""ROBOT"" has R at 1, O at 2, B at 3, O at 4, T at 5. But we have two O's. We don't know if the secret word has two O's. But we haven't seen any duplicate feedback. So it's possible? But we are avoiding duplicates for now? Actually, we don't know.

But we have to avoid I, so let's skip.

Another word: ""RALLY""? 
  R at 1, A at 2, L at 3, L at 4, Y at 5. But we cannot put A at 2 (we know it's not at 2). So invalid.

How about ""RALLY"" is invalid because of A at 2.

How about ""TAROT""? 
  T at 1, A at 2, R at 3, O at 4, T at 5 -> duplicate T? and A at 2 is invalid.

We need a word without A at 2.

How about ""OCTAL""? But we have C? We know C is not in the word (from first guess: C is x). So we cannot use C.

We must avoid C, E, I, N.

So the word must not contain C, E, I, N.

Let me think of words that fit the constraints.

We can try:

Option 1: A at position 1.
  Then the word: A _ _ _ _
  R must be at 3,4,5.
  T must be at 2,4,5 (but not 3).
  O must be at 2,3,4 (but not 5).

But position 2: we can try T? Yes, because T can be at 2.

So: A, T, R, O, and then the fifth letter.

But what positions?
  A at 1, T at 2, R at 3? Then we have positions 4 and 5 for O and the fifth letter? But O must be at 3? We are putting O at 3? But we don't know if O can be at 3.

But we haven't tested O at 3. So it's possible.

But we have to assign: 
  Position 1: A
  Position 2: T
  Position 3: R -> but R at 3? We haven't tested R at 3. So it's possible.

But then we have O and the fifth letter left. But we have to put O in a position that is not 5? So positions 3 or 4? But position 3 is taken by R? So O must be at 4? Then position 5 must be the fifth letter.

So: A, T, R, O, ?

But we have to form a word. What word? ""ATRO"" ... ""ATRO"" is not a word. 

How about ""AORTY""? Not a word.

Another option: put A at 4.

Then:
  Positions: 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: A, 5: ?

Then R must be at 3,4,5? But position 4 is taken by A, so R at 3 or 5.

T must be at 1,2,5? But if R is at 5, then T can be at 1 or 2.

O must be at 1,2,3? But position 3: if we put O at 3, then we have:
  Position 1: ?
  Position 2: ?
  Position 3: O
  Position 4: A
  Position 5: R? But then T must be at 1 or 2.

But we have to assign the fifth letter? Actually, we have four positions: 1,2,3,5 and we have three letters: T, O, R? But we have five positions and four letters? So one of the positions must be the fifth letter.

But we have to put T, O, R, and the fifth letter. And we have positions 1,2,3,5 for them.

But we know T cannot be at 3? So T must be at 1 or 2.

O must not be at 5? So O can be at 3? Then position 5 must be the fifth letter.

So: 
  Position 1: T or the fifth letter?
  Position 2: T or the fifth letter? But we have to assign.

But we don't know the fifth letter. We know it must be a letter that is not C, E, I, N.

Let me try to find words that start with T? Or end with T?

How about ""TOTem""? But that has E? E is excluded.

How about ""TOWER""? But E is excluded.

How about ""TAROT""? But A is at 2? We know A is not at 2. So invalid.

How about ""TARGO""? Not a word.

Another idea: put R at position 4.

Then:
  Positions: 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: R, 5: ?

Then A must be at 1,4,5? But position 4 is taken by R, so A at 1 or 5.

T must be at 1,2,5? But if A is at 1, then T can be at 2 or 5? And O must be at 1,2,3? But position 1 is taken, so O at 2 or 3.

So if A is at 1, then:
  Position 1: A
  Position 2: O? Or T? Or the fifth letter?
  Position 3: O? Or the fifth letter? But we have to assign.

But we know T must be in the word? So T must be at 2 or 5.

If we put T at 2, then O can be at 3? Then position 5: fifth letter.

Word: A, T, O, R, ?

But ""ATOR"" is not a word. ""ATORM""? But M? And we don't know about M. ""ATORM"" is not a word.

How about ""AORTY""? Not a word.

Alternatively, if we put A at 5.

Then:
  Positions: 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: R, 5: A

Then T must be at 1,2,4? But position 4 is R, so T at 1 or 2.

O must be at 1,2,3? But if T is at 1, then O can be at 2 or 3? And the fifth letter at the remaining.

But we have to avoid I? So positions 1,2,3,4,5: 
  Position 1: T or the fifth letter?
  Position 2: T or the fifth letter? But we have to assign.

Example: T at 1, then O at 2, then position 3: the fifth letter, position 4: R, position 5: A.

Word: T, O, ?, R, A -> ""TO?RA""? 

What word? ""TORAH""? But H? And ""TORAH"" is a word? It's a musical instrument. But let's check: T at 1, O at 2, R at 3? But R at 3? We haven't tested R at 3. And A at 5? We haven't tested A at 5.

But we also have to avoid I? Yes.

""TORAH"": T, O, R, A, H. 
  Positions: 
    1: T -> we are testing T at 1. If T is at 1, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know T is at 2,4, or 5? But we have A at 5 and R at 3.

But we haven't tested H.

But we are testing T at 1? And if T is at 1, we get a ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know T is at 2,4, or 5.

Similarly, O at 2: we haven't tested O at 2? In the second guess, O was at 5 and got '-', so O is not at 5. But we haven't tested O at 2.

So ""TORAH"" is a candidate.

But is ""TORAH"" a valid word? Yes.

But we have to consider: if we use ""TORAH"", then:
  Position 1: T -> if T is at 1, we get ✓. If not, we get '-' and then we know T is at 2,4,5.
  Position 2: O -> if O is at 2, we get ✓. If not, we get '-' and then we know O is not at 2? But we haven't tested O at 2.

But we also have R at 3: if R is at 3, we get ✓. If not, we get '-' and then we know R is at 4 or 5.

Similarly, A at 5: if A is at 5, ✓. If not, we get '-' and then A must be at 1 or 4? But we are putting A at 5, so if it's not there, then A must be at 1 or 4.

But we are also testing H.

Alternatively, we can try ""ROTAL"" (which is not a word) or ""ROTAS"" (which is a word? rotas is not common). 

How about ""ROTAS"": 
  R at 1? But we know R is not at 1 (from second guess: R at 1 was marked as wrong position). So we cannot put R at 1.

How about ""STARE""? But E is excluded.

How about ""STARK""? 
  S, T, A, R, K -> but we have to avoid E? Yes.
  A at 3? But we know A is not at position 3 (from first guess). So invalid.

How about ""START""? 
  S, T, A, R, T -> duplicate T? And A at 3? Invalid.

How about ""PARTY"": 
  P, A, R, T, Y -> A at 2? We know A is not at 2. So invalid.

How about ""RALLY""? 
  R at 1? We know R is not at 1. So invalid.

We are having trouble finding a word that fits.

Another candidate: ""OAKUM""? But we have U and M, and we don't know about them. Also, O at 1, A at 2? A at 2 is invalid.

How about ""DOZEN""? But E and N are excluded.

We need to avoid E, C, N, I.

Let me try a different approach: put R at position 4.

Then:
  Positions: 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: R, 5: ?

Now, A must be at 1,4,5? But position 4 is R, so A at 1 or 5.

T must be at 1,2,5? But if A is at 1, then T can be at 2 or 5? And O must be at 1,2,3? But position 1 is taken, so O at 2 or 3.

So if A at 1, then:
  Position 1: A
  Position 2: O? -> then position 3: ? (must be the fifth letter? but we have to put T? Wait, T must be placed. But if we put O at 2, then T must be at 5? Because position 3 must be the fifth letter? But we have to put T somewhere.

But we have positions 1,2,3,5: 
  Position 1: A
  Position 2: O? 
  Position 3: must be T? Because we have to put T and it's the only position left? But we have T to place and the fifth letter. But we have three positions: 1,2,3,5 and we have two letters: T and the fifth? But we have three letters: R, A, T, O and the fifth? Actually, we have four positions: 1,2,3,5 and we have to place R, A, T, O and the fifth letter? But we have only four positions and five letters? So one position must be the fifth letter.

But we have to assign positions without conflict.

So if A is at 1, then:
  Position 1: A
  Position 2: O? -> then position 3: T? -> but T can be at 3? No, because we tried T at 3 in the second guess and it was marked as wrong position? So T cannot be at 3.

Therefore, if A is at 1, we cannot put T at 3. So T must be at 2 or 5.

But if we put T at 2, then position 3 must be the fifth letter? But we have to put O somewhere. O can be at 3? But then position 3 is O? Then position 5 is the fifth letter.

So: A, T, O, R, ? -> but then position 4 must be the fifth letter? But we have R at 4? Actually, we are putting R at 4? But we haven't tested R at 4.

But we are putting A at 1, T at 2, O at 3, R at 4, and fifth letter at 5.

But we have to avoid E, C, N, I. And we did.

So ""ATORM""? Not a word.

How about ""AORTY""? Not a word.

Another word: ""AUDIO"" is invalid because of I.

How about ""MORTY""? But we have M, O, R, T, Y. 
  M at 1, O at 2, R at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.
  Check constraints:
    A: we are not including? But we know A is in the word. So we must include A.

We must include all the letters we know are in the word: R, A, T, O.

So the word must have R, A, T, O and one more.

So the fifth letter must be one that we haven't guessed and is not excluded.

We have excluded: C, E, I, N.

So the fifth letter can be: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to test a common letter.

But we are having trouble forming a word.

Let me try to list possible words that have R, A, T, O and one more letter, avoiding C, E, I, N.

For example:
  ""ROTAL"" -> not a word.
  ""ROTAS"" -> not common? But ""ROTAS"" is a word? It means to rotate or vary rate? Not very common.
  ""ROTAN"" -> but N is excluded.

How about ""ROBOT""? But has O twice? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, B and T? But we have to avoid E, C, N, I. ""ROBOT"" has O twice? And we are avoiding duplicates? Actually, we don't know. But we can avoid.

How about ""ROAST""? But we have S and T? And A at 2? We know A is not at 2. So invalid.

How about ""RUSTY"": 
  R at 1? We know R is not at 1. So invalid.

How about ""RALLY"": invalid because of A at 2.

How about ""TAROT"": 
  T at 1, A at 2? A at 2 is invalid.

How about ""TARGO"": not a word.

How about ""TAROK"": not a word.

How about ""TAKEN"": but E and N are excluded.

Another idea: put A at position 4.

Then:
  Positions: 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: A, 5: ?

Now, R must be at 3,4,5? But position 4 is A, so R at 3 or 5.

T must be at 1,2,5? But if R is at 5, then T can be at 1 or 2.

O must be at 1,2,3? But if R is at 5, then O can be at 1,2,3.

So if we put:
  Position 1: T? Or the fifth letter?
  Position 2: T? Or the fifth letter? But we have to assign.

Example: T at 1, then position 2: the fifth letter? Then position 3: O? Then position 4: A, position 5: R.

Word: T, ?, O, A, R -> ""T?OAR""? 

What words? ""TOWER"" has E? Excluded.

"" TUMOR""? But U and M? And ""TUMOR"" has U and M, but no A? We need A at 4.

How about ""TAROT"": invalid because of A at 2.

How about ""TAROK"": not a word.

How about ""TALON""? But N is excluded.

How about ""TALOR""? Not a word.

How about ""TAMOR""? Not a word.

How about ""TABOR""? Not a word.

How about ""TAJOR""? No.

Another word: ""MANOR""? But M, A, N, O, R -> but N is excluded.

How about ""FJORD""? But we have F, J, O, R, D. But we don't know about F, J, D. Also, we are missing A? We must include A.

We must include A, R, T, O.

So the word must have A, R, T, O and one more.

How about ""AORTY""? Not a word.

How about ""AORTAL""? Too long.

We need 5 letters.

How about ""RADIO""? But we already tried ""ratio"" and we know I is not in the word. ""RADIO"" has I? No, ""RADIO"" has D, I, O? But I is excluded.

So we cannot use ""RADIO"".

How about ""RAPID"": 
  R at 1? We know R is not at 1. So invalid.

How about ""RALLY"": A at 2? Invalid.

How about ""TAROT"": A at 2? Invalid.

We are stuck.

Another candidate: ""ORATE""? But E is excluded.

How about ""OCTAD""? But C is excluded.

How about ""OAKUM"": 
  O at 1, A at 2? A at 2 is invalid.

How about ""OAPES"": but E and S? E is excluded.

How about ""OASIS"": has S and I? I is excluded.

How about ""OASIS"": has S and I? I is excluded.

How about ""OAVES"": E and S? E excluded.

How about ""OCEAN"": C and E excluded.

We need to avoid E, C, N, I.

Let me try a different arrangement: put R at position 5.

Then:
  Positions: 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: ?, 5: R

Now, A must be at 1,4,5? But position 5 is R, so A at 1 or 4.

T must be at 1,2,4? But if A is at 1, then T can be at 2 or 4.

O must be at 1,2,3,4? But if A is at 1, then O can be at 2 or 3 or 4.

So if A at 1, T at 2, then O at 3 or 4.

And position 4 or 5 must be the fifth letter.

So: 
  Position 1: A
  Position 2: T
  Position 3: O? Then position 4: fifth letter? But O can be at 3? Yes.
  Position 4: fifth letter? But we have to put O? Actually, we have to assign O to a position.

But if we put O at 3, then position 4: fifth letter, position 5: R.

Word: A, T, O, ?, R

What words? ""ATOLL"" -> but duplicate L? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, O is at 3? But we haven't tested O at 3.

But ""ATOLL"" has duplicate L? And we don't know if the secret word has duplicates.

But we are avoiding duplicates for now.

How about ""ATOMS"": 
  A at 1, T at 2, O at 3, M at 4, S at 5? 
  Check constraints:
    R: we are not including? But we must include R.

We must include R.

So we need R in the word.

How about ""AORTY""? Not a word.

How about ""AUDIO""? I excluded.

How about ""ABOUT"": 
  A at 1, B at 2, O at 3, U at 4, T at 5.
  Check:
    R: not in the word? But we know R is in the word. So we must have R.

We have R, A, T, O. ""ABOUT"" has A, B, O, U, T -> no R.

So invalid.

How about ""AORTY"" is not a word.

How about ""AERIE""? E excluded.

We are having trouble. Maybe we should consider that the fifth letter might be one that we haven't thought of.

Another candidate: ""ROTAS"": 
  R at 1? We know R is not at 1. So invalid.

How about ""ROTAL"": not a word.

How about ""ROTAS"": 
  R at 1 -> invalid.

How about ""TORAH"": 
  T at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, H at 5.
  Check:
    A at 4: we haven't tested A at 4? So it's possible.
    R at 3: we haven't tested R at 3? So it's possible.
    T at 1: we haven't tested T at 1? So it's possible.
    O at 2: we haven't tested O at 2? So it's possible.

And the fifth letter is H.

So ""TORAH"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning a musical instrument.

And it avoids C, E, I, N.

So let's use ""TORAH"".

But note: we are testing:
  T at 1: if correct, ✓. If not, we get a '-' and then we know T is at 2,4, or 5? But we have T at 1, so if it's not at 1, then T must be at 2,4, or 5.

Similarly, O at 2: if correct, ✓. If not, then O is not at 2? But we haven't tested O at 2 before? Actually, in the second guess, O was at 5, so we haven't tested O at 2.

R at 3: we haven't tested R at 3? So we are testing it.

A at 4: we haven't tested A at 4? So we are testing it.

H at 5: new letter.

So this is a valid guess.

But we have to make sure that we are not repeating the same mistake.

Alternatively, we can try ""HORDE"": but E is excluded.

How about ""HORDE"" is invalid.

Another word: ""HORNY""? But N is excluded.

How about ""HORDE"" is not allowed because of E.

How about ""GATOR""? Not a word.

How about ""VOTER""? E excluded.

How about ""BOTER""? E excluded.

How about ""ROTAL"" -> not a word.

How about ""ROTAS"": 
  R at 1 -> invalid.

How about ""TORAH"" is the best so far.

Another word: ""ROTAS"" is not common, but ""TORAH"" is acceptable.

But let me confirm: 
  T at 1: if the secret word has T at 1, we get ✓. If not, we get '-' and then we know T is at 2,4,5.
  O at 2: if O is at 2, we get ✓. If not, we get '-' and then we know O is not at 2? But we haven't tested O at 2 before? Actually, we haven't tested O at 2, so it's okay.

But we have to be cautious: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't have any indication, but we can avoid.

Alternatively, we can try ""TORUS"": 
  T at 1, O at 2, R at 3, U at 4, S at 5.
  But we are missing A? We must have A.

So invalid.

We must include A.

Another candidate: ""ABOUT"" is no good because no R.

How about ""AORTA"": duplicate A? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, A at 1 and 5? But we are putting A at 1 and 5? But we don't know if the word has duplicates.

But we have to avoid I? ""AORTA"" has A twice? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, it has I? No, ""AORTA"" has A, O, R, T, A -> duplicate A. And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Moreover, we have to avoid I? It doesn't have I, but it has A twice and we don't know.

But we are avoiding duplicates? Actually, we don't know. But we can avoid.

But ""AORTA"" is not a common word.

How about ""AORTY""? Not a word.

How about ""AERIE""? E excluded.

I think ""TORAH"" is a valid and common word.

So I'll go with ""TORAH"".

But let me see if there is a word with S or L.

How about ""TORUS"" without A? No.

How about ""TAROT"" without A? No.

How about ""TALON"" without R? No.

We must have R.

Another word: ""TORAH"" is one.

But what about ""ROTAN""? N excluded.

How about ""ROTAS"": 
  R at 1 -> invalid.

How about ""TORAL""? Not a word.

How about ""TORAM""? Not a word.

How about ""TORAH"" is the best.

But note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating the same positions for R and A that we already know are wrong.

In ""TORAH"":
  T at 1: we haven't tried T at 1? So we are testing it.
  O at 2: we haven't tried O at 2? So we are testing it.
  R at 3: we haven't tried R at 3? So we are testing it.
  A at 4: we haven't tried A at 4? So we are testing it.
  H at 5: new letter.

And we avoid C, E, I, N.

So I think ""TORAH"" is a good guess.

But let me think of another word: ""ROTAL"" is not a word.

How about ""ROTAS"": 
  R at 1 -> invalid.

How about ""TORAH"" is the only one I can think of.

Another one: ""ROTAN"" is not allowed because of N.

How about ""VOTER"": E excluded.

I think we should go with ""TORAH"".

But wait, what about ""TAROT""? We cannot because A is at 2.

How about ""TABOR""? Not a word.

So I choose ""TORAH"".

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have the letter at a position we haven't tried.

But we have to test.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a different fifth letter.

For example, ""ROTAL"" is not a word.

How about ""ROTAS"": 
  R at 1 -> invalid.

How about ""TORAH"" is the word.

But let me search for other words.

Another word: ""ROTAL"" is not a word.

How about ""ROTAS"": 
  R at 1 -> invalid.

How about ""TORAH"" is the only common word I can think of.

So I'll go with ""TORAH"".

But note: we have to make sure that we are not putting a letter in a position that we already know is wrong for that letter? We haven't tested any of these positions for each letter.

So let's guess ""TORAH"".

But wait, what about the fifth letter? In ""TORAH"", the fifth letter is H. We haven't tested H.

But we are testing it.

Alternatively, we can try ""ABOUT"" but without R.

We must include R.

Another candidate: ""TORAL"" is not a word.

How about ""TORAM""? Not a word.

I think ""TORAH"" is acceptable.

So I'll guess ""TORAH"".

But let me write it: T at 1, O at 2, R at 3, A at 4, H at 5.

But wait, we are putting O at 2 and A at 4. We haven't tested O at 2 and A at 4? So we are testing them.

And R at 3: we haven't tested R at 3.

So that's good.

Therefore, the next guess is ""TORAH"".

But note: we have to be cautious. What if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't have any indication, but we are avoiding duplicates in this guess.

So I'll go with ""TORAH"".

<guess>torah</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Excluded letters**: C, E, I, N (from ""crane"" and ""ratio"" feedback).
- **Included letters**: R, A, T, O (confirmed present in the word).
- **Position constraints**:
  - R cannot be at position 1 (tested in ""ratio"") or 2 (tested in ""crane""), so R must be at 3, 4, or 5.
  - A cannot be at position 2 (tested in ""ratio"") or 3 (tested in ""crane""), so A must be at 1, 4, or 5.
  - T cannot be at position 3 (tested in ""ratio""), so T must be at 1, 2, 4, or 5.
  - O cannot be at position 5 (tested in ""ratio""), so O must be at 1, 2, 3, or 4.

The word **""TORAH""** satisfies all constraints:
- **T** at position 1 (tests if T is at 1).
- **O** at position 2 (tests if O is at 2).
- **R** at position 3 (tests if R is at 3).
- **A** at position 4 (tests if A is at 4).
- **H** (new letter) at position 5.

This guess tests new positions for R, A, T, and O, while introducing H to check for the fifth missing letter.",Guess 3: torah -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) O(✓) R(✓) A(✓) H(✓),SUCCESS
